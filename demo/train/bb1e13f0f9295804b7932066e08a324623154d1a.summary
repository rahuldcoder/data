@entity0 -- @entity3 euphoria confronted reality sunday , with @entity6 primary winner @entity5 backing out of scheduled talk show appearances amid talk of possible civil war among @entity10 over the conservative movement			1
@entity13 sen. @entity12 accused the @entity14 of infusing money and lies into her @entity10 primary to swing it against her			1
now waging a write - in campaign to retain her seat , against the wishes of mainstream @entity10 , @entity12 told @entity1 that fellow party members were inciting inner - @entity10 conflict			1
" what happened in my particular race , you had the @entity14 , this @entity27 - based group , come in at the last minute in a campaign , run a mudslinging , smear -- just a terrible , terrible campaign , with lies and fabrications and mischaracterization , " @entity12 said on @entity1 's " @entity23 " program			2
" they came in , they dumped $ 600,000 into a small market here in @entity13 , and they absolutely clearly influenced the outcome of that election			0
" @entity12 accused conservative @entity10 sen. @entity42 of @entity43 , who backed her victorious opponent in the primary , of undermining fellow @entity10			1
" i do n't think that it 's particularly helpful to undercut fellow @entity10 , but as i say , it 's his prerogative , " @entity12 said of @entity42 , later adding : " i think that he has made people uncomfortable			1
i think that he has kind of rattled the cages			0
whether it advances to a full - on civil war , i do n't know			2
" on the same program , @entity42 said in a pre-recorded interview that his efforts have helped @entity10 chances of regaining control of the @entity6 in november 's mid-term elections			2
" the only reason we have a chance at a majority now is in large part for the candidates i 've been supporting , " @entity42 said			0
@entity42 's support for @entity68 over @entity12 and for @entity5 in @entity69 , who defeated veteran @entity70 rep. @entity70 in tuesday 's @entity69 primary for vice president @entity73 's former @entity6 seat , caused consternation in @entity10 party circles			1
some fear such extreme conservative candidates ca n't win statewide races and are unprepared for the scrutiny of such a campaign			1
@entity5 added to such concerns by canceling previously agreed - to interviews on " @entity83 " and the @entity85 program " @entity87 , " deciding instead to make appearances in @entity69			1
@entity88 , the host of the @entity85 program , said on air that @entity5 's representatives denied she withdrew because of videotape released over the weekend showing her talking about dabbling in witchcraft			0
whatever the reason , @entity5 continued to serve as a lightning rod for analysis of the influence of the @entity3 movement			0
she was given little chance of defeating @entity70 , but received late support from former @entity13 gov. @entity102 as well as @entity3 money , and pulled off the upset			0
now the 11 - year - old " witchcraft " video and others becoming public are reinforcing the image preferred by @entity109 of @entity5 as an unknown , untested and risky candidate			2
@entity10 strategist @entity111 acknowledged the problem on the @entity85 program , saying @entity5 was off to a rocky beginning			1
" right now this campaign 's about her , " said @entity111 , who is a @entity1 senior political analyst			0
" unless she gets her ship righted ... this is not a good start			0
" another top @entity10 strategist , former @entity122 @entity121 aide @entity120 , softened his earlier criticism of @entity5 , whom he described as unelectable last tuesday			1
appearing on the @entity83 program , @entity120 joined other mainstream @entity10 in supporting the @entity5 campaign but called @entity12 's write - in campaign selfish and ultimately unsuccessful			1
" she 's going to lose , " @entity120 said			0
" who would 've thought that one of the most conservative states in the country ran the risk of having two @entity109 who follow the @entity134 line representing in the @entity135 ? and that 's what she could do as a spoilsport			0
" he added : " this is sad and sorry			0
" at the same time , @entity120 denied there was " civil war " between the @entity3 movement and republicans			2
democrats conceded that the @entity3 movement reflects real anger and frustration with continuing high unemployment and the growing federal deficit			0
however , @entity152 chairman @entity151 , the former @entity153 governor , told @entity1 that voters now have clear choices for the november elections with the primary season completed			1
" i think the @entity10 are moving way to the right of the @entity163 electorate , " @entity151 said of the @entity3 movement 's influence			2
@entity1 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this story .			0
