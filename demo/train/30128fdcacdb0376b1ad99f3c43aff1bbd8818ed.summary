the second report , which is not signed nor dated , is not nearly as critical as the first			0
" i was not called by investigating officers regarding this death until the afore listed time of notification , " it read			0
it was not immediately clear why there were two coroner 's reports			1
the inconsistencies between them were also not clear			0
when contacted by @entity0 , a lawyer for the @entity27 sheriff and the @entity27 coroner declined to address specific questions about the reports			1
" in light of the @entity73 attorney 's review of this matter , the @entity27 sheriff and the @entity27 coroner will not comment further on this case			1
they will fully cooperate and respond to all inquiries of the @entity73 attorney , " @entity76 wrote in an e-mail			0
the @entity73 attorney 's office in @entity83 , @entity4 , opened an investigation into the case last week			0
while warning his jurisdiction is limited as a federal prosecutor , @entity87 , the @entity88 , said that after a lengthy review of evidence collected by authorities and the family 's own investigator , " sufficient basis exists " to warrant a formal review of the facts			2
a @entity4 judge on thursday ruled that pending the outcome of that review , he will decide whether to order a coroner 's inquest			2

a lawyer for them said they would appeal			0
family questions video oddities also thursday , lawyers for @entity9 's family raised questions about apparent discrepancies in newly released surveillance images , including missing time codes , gaps and a mysteriously blurry and out - of - position camera that should have been pointed right at the spot where authorities found @entity9 's body some 10 months ago			1
the surveillance images were provided by authorities after a judge ruled they must be released			1
for instance , in one image , a man seen walking away from the gym in what appears to be an image captured late at night suddenly disappears from a series of images shot by a motion - activated camera			2
other images shot at other times capture people walking in that same location , attorney @entity129 said			2
new footage release in the case of @entity9 in another example , @entity129 showed reporters images from a camera that he said should have shown the place where authorities say @entity9 fell into a gym mat and suffocated			2
the image was blurry and out of position , he said			0
while stopping short of directly accusing authorities of deliberately tampering with the evidence , @entity129 said problems with the surveillance are only the latest in a series of oddities that have drawn national attention to @entity9 's death			2

" we have had what i think is a series of events that causes you to raise the question , when does a coincidence stop being a coincidence , " @entity129 told reporters wednesday in @entity167 , @entity4			2
@entity129 demanded that authorities hand over originals of the surveillance video showing time codes and other evidence that he said could show whether the materials had been tampered with			1
@entity76 , the attorney for @entity27 sheriff @entity183 , said that his client has confirmed the video had not been altered or edited by anyone within the sheriff 's office			1
an attorney for the school likewise said that what was provided to the sheriff 's office was the raw feed with no edits			1
federal prosecutor will look into @entity9 case @entity9 's father , @entity196 , angrily demanded justice , calling authorities corrupt and vowing the family will not stop until they get answers to what happened to his son			2
" the @entity205 , the @entity206 's office , they convict people all the time inside this courthouse , " he said			0
" should they not be held responsible for the lies they are telling and for the corruption ? "			0
