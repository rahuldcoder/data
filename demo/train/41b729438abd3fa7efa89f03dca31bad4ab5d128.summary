-- @entity1 : @entity2 is in many ways the most compelling figure in @entity6 history , yet the popular culture around him in terms of movies has been pretty minimal			1
why is that ? @entity11 : it 's one of the big mysteries			1
they float so many trial balloons with @entity2 's face every year in the form of advertising , spoofs , parodies , " @entity22 " sketches , presidents ' day commercials			1
@entity2 has kind of become a caricature			1
one of the last movies , which i have n't seen in 15 or 20 years , that was about @entity2 was in the ' 30s , with @entity27 — " @entity28			1
" i do n't understand why it 's taken so long for anybody , let alone our group , to bring @entity2 to a movie theater			1
@entity1 : you use a fascinating framing device for the movie : the passage of the 13th amendment , abolishing slavery			1
@entity11 : the 13th amendment was critical to @entity2 , because he knew that if the war ended , this would never get through			1
the @entity41 could n't live without slavery			2
they might cease hostilities , but @entity2 always believed that unless we abolish slavery before this war ends , the end of this war will just be a momentary pause between this war and the next war			1
so he knew he had to get this thing done , but he did n't have the votes			2
that 's at the heart of our movie , this fight to get the votes , to do the right thing			0
@entity1 : there 's an @entity64 expression , " cometh the moment , cometh the man			0
" how much of it was @entity2 at that moment , or did the moment make him ? @entity11 : @entity2 had the ambition			1
he had a beautiful vision for @entity6			0
but i do n't know what kind of progress he would have made without the crisis that fell into his lap. i also do n't know what kind of a president @entity76 would have become without the @entity79 and @entity80 , or what @entity81 would ultimately have been remembered for without all of us standing on the brink of nuclear holocaust during the @entity74			2
time.com : how the greatest living actor became @entity2 @entity1 : let 's talk about his temperament			1
his leadership style in many ways seems so alien to what we value today			0
@entity11 : taking all of his traits — of long , deep thought , of staring deeply into the future , taking the broad view , respecting the past , exploring deep into the cold depths of himself while his entire @entity100 sat around waiting for him to make a decision about anything — i 'm not sure there 's a mayoral position that would be suitable for him in this kind of adrenaline - fueled era that we all exist in			1
even then , the newspapers were going after him			0
@entity1 : one of the things that comes through in the movie is @entity2 's relationship with his wife , his relationship with his youngest son			1
he would get down on the ground all the time			0
it showed that he was n't that statue that was standing up there 20 feet high			0
@entity11 : he certainly did everything that he needed to do to hold his family together , not just this country			1
he had lost [ his 11 - year - old son ] @entity124 two years ago to typhoid fever			2
@entity126 spent years mourning the loss of @entity124			0
in [ @entity130 's ] book " @entity131 , " what precedes our story is two years of @entity126 shunning the whole family and spending time holding séances and trying to reach out and communicate across the thin veil to @entity124			0
@entity2 had that burden on his shoulders			2
he was really carrying a lot of weight during that time			0
@entity1 : @entity143 ' performance integrates all these different sides of @entity2 in a really extraordinary way			1
what was that like directing him ? @entity11 : @entity143 did something at first that made me sad			1
he wanted to wait a year			2
and it was a masterstroke , because he had a year to do research			2
he had a year to find the character in his own private process			2
he had a year to discover how @entity2 sounded , and he found the voice			1
he had @entity2 so embedded in his psyche , in his soul , in his mind , that i would come to work in the morning and @entity2 would sit behind his desk , and we would begin			2
@entity1 : i believe you called him mr. president ? @entity11 : all during the picture i called him mr. president , but that was my idea			1
i also wore a suit every day , which i do n't usually do when i 'm directing			0
everybody was dressed up in their period wardrobe			0
i did not wear 19th century wardrobe			0
i wore pretty good clothes from this era			0
i just wanted to blend in			0
we knew we were in the 21st century at all times			0
but once you stepped onto the stages of the @entity181 , everybody really felt that they were making a contribution to remembering this critical moment in our shared history			0

@entity11 is bringing @entity2 to the movies with " @entity193 "
@entity143 plays the president , and took a year to prepare
@entity11 uses the 13th amendment as a framing device
while war raged , @entity2 also was dealing with *personal* issues at home
