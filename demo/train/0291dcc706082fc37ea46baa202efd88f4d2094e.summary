genetic test predicts brain aging disorders such as @entity4 's disease and @entity5 's			1
a @entity7 study , announced in january 2008 , details an unprecedented method to predict brain aging disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , called als or @entity4 's disease , and parkinson 's disease			1
investigators identified several gene mutations that predicted which people are at high risk for @entity12 and @entity5 's , which afflicts a million @entity18			1
people with one set of genetic mutations were 2,000 times more likely than normal to develop @entity12			1
those with the other set are 400 times more likely than normal to suffer from @entity5			2
researchers say this approach may be used to predict other complex diseases such as @entity26 's , strokes , diabetes and cancer			2
they say , for example , if a test is developed that predicts someone is at high risk for diabetes , that person can change his or her behavior through exercise and diet to prevent the disease			0
what does this mean for people who will get these diseases ? dr. @entity44 , @entity45 chief medical correspondent : you ca n't prevent diseases like @entity5 's or @entity12			1
but researchers hope that by showing there are gene mutations that cause these brain diseases , new drugs will be created to prevent them			2
brain cells go from the brain and travel down to the end of the spinal cord			0
this pathway tells these brain cells which direction to go in the body			0
but if something goes wrong and there is a mistake in where the cells are told to go , this is enough to cause a disease			0
let 's say the cell travels from the brain , but stops at the shoulders or at the chest -- this could cause als or @entity5 's			1
keep in mind that these are devastating conditions			0
one million @entity18 have @entity5 's , which causes shakes , stiffness and slow movement			1
@entity12 , which causes muscles to waste away and leaves patients totally paralyzed , affects 30,000 people in the @entity18 how accurate were they in predicting who could get @entity12 and @entity5 's ? @entity44 : very accurate			1
more than 90 percent of the time , researchers correctly predicted who would get als or @entity5 's			1
they were also able to predict the age when people would get these diseases with 85 percent accuracy			2
there is n't a way to prevent these diseases , but this research could be used as a model to develop other tests that could predict diseases such as cancer , diabetes and strokes			1
this could actually end up saving lives			0
let 's say someone finds out they 're at high risk of getting diabetes			0
they could start eating healthy and exercising more to delay or prevent the disease			0
what are the implications of this ? @entity44 : it will allow other people to make similar tests for a lot of other diseases in record time			2
it 's possible they could make a simple blood test that tells people at birth what diseases they 're likely to get			2
for example , if you see that someone is likely to get @entity127 , you can start getting that kid special schooling			0
let 's say another person is at high risk for prostate cancer			0
you can start getting them tested early , at age 30 .			0

this new method of genetic testing can help determine who *'ll* get @entity12 , @entity5 's and one *day* may lead to tests that can predict other diseases
