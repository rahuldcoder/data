according to @entity46 , prosecutors said @entity8 knew " perfectly well " that @entity54 was suspected of murder , but deliberately covered up for her so she would not be held legally responsible for @entity58 's death -- a fact that was repeated during monday 's court session , @entity7 said			1

@entity16 and @entity8 were known to have worked closely on @entity16 's signature crime - fighting program in 2009			2
