thinking about picking up a @entity0 this sunday when it goes on sale ? already have one preordered ? maybe you 're planning to brave the lines in hopes of lucking out ? it 's not too late to change your mind , one way or the other			1
i 've had a @entity0 for the past week , and while i 'm not allowed to tell you what i think about the system overall until sunday , i 've pulled together a list of points worth considering before you pull the trigger			1
it 's pre-sold out , everywhere			2
visit the website of any major retailer that carries video games and you 'll find the @entity0 is either long gone or was n't being pre-sold in the first place			1
the only way to guarantee a system , day one , is to purchase through an auction site like @entity25 or through retailers that allow third - party sales like @entity29			2
it 's likely you 'll pay dearly if you do , of course — from $ 400 or $ 500 to upwards of $ 3,000			0
you can always stand in line			0
many retailers held units back to have on hand , day one , or simply did n't offer pre-sales			2
you 'll want to check with your local stores for their launch day plans , but this is arguably the best route to nab a @entity0 at launch if you did n't preorder and do n't want to pay scalper prices			1
@entity45 says it should have plenty to go around			2
not on day one , but @entity45 has publicly committed to having more @entity0 units in stores during the first week than it did for the @entity0 six years ago , and it 's doubled down on that claim by stating it 'll replenish systems " much more frequently " during the holiday than it did for the @entity0			1
the @entity0 is n't just a @entity0 plus a ds. it may look like a @entity55 plus a @entity56 , and it clearly shares second - screen dna with the @entity56 , but it 's not a ds. the @entity56 is about what you can do when you put a second screen right next to the first screen and both of those in a device that fits in your hands			1
the @entity0 is about what you can do if you make one of the screens your tv , snap off the other , then let it wander			2
and it 's not really possible for more than one person to play a @entity56 , whereas multiple players ( in the same room ) are a key part of the @entity0 experience			1
it 's also more than just a souped up @entity0			1
the @entity0 was arguably just a souped up @entity78 with a motion sensor			1
the @entity0 is much more than just a souped up @entity0 with a tablet controller			1
it still supports @entity0 - style motion controls , but its insides are totally different — either as or more powerful than ( depending which developer you talk to ) current - gen systems like the @entity86 or @entity87			2
it 's also the first hd - capable @entity45 console in the company 's history , and so far i 'm finding that makes a pretty big difference for the visual artistry , say , in a game like @entity96 initial game port fidelity varies , but this tells us little			1
running visual comparisons of @entity101 : @entity102 , i found that while it looks great on the @entity0 , the @entity86 version 's textures tend to be sharper , especially when viewing distant objects			1
i 've also noticed significant slowdown in the @entity0 version of @entity108 ( it was only added as a launch title in early october )			2
what does that mean ? it 's hard to say			0
@entity102 is a port of a year - old game that was n't handled by the original developer			0
new systems can have steep learning curves , especially when it comes to ports			0
so while we 're probably about to be inundated with visual and performance comparisons , i do n't think they 'll tell us much about what the @entity0 can or ca n't do , long term			1
the games only support one @entity126			0
the @entity0 comes with just one @entity126 , and @entity45 is n't selling the @entity126 as a separate sku ( not yet , anyway )			1
there 's been plenty of speculation about why this is , but regardless of the real reason , you 'll want to be aware that wielding the @entity133 is a one - person affair ( though it 's still possible for up to four other local players to tap into a supported game using @entity137 )			0
according to @entity45 : " in the future , the @entity0 console will support , depending on the software , two @entity126 controllers			1
" both the @entity142 and deluxe models come with an hdmi cable			0
and only an hdmi cable			0
you 'd expect the @entity0 to forego component or @entity148 , but game consoles usually include a low - end composite cable ( red and white for stereo audio , the yellow connector pooling the red , green and blue video signals , which causes color bleed , creating a fuzzier image )			2
@entity45 gets credit for being first to ditch composite entirely , which is kind of historic , since the composite standard came into existence back in 1954			2
the $ 350 deluxe model is a significantly better deal than the $ 300 basic model			0
@entity164 , the @entity166 - like showcase game that comes with the @entity0 , sells for $ 60 standalone , so that it 's a pack - in with the deluxe model justifies the extra $ 50 alone			1
but the @entity169 also includes 32 gb of internal storage ( the @entity142 only has 8 gb , and roughly 4 gb of that is earmarked for system data ) , a @entity126 charging cradle , a @entity126 stand and a @entity0 console stand			1
@entity45 's so clearly aiming buyers at the deluxe model , it 'll be a wonder if they sell any basic systems at all			1
the @entity0 is backward compatible with the @entity0			2
i ca n't confirm this yet , because the system update necessary to allow the @entity0 to play @entity0 games has n't arrived , but @entity45 says it 's a sure thing			1
one feature the @entity0 wo n't offer : visual benefits , say upscaling or post-processing , as @entity188 did for @entity190 games on the @entity192 and @entity192 games on the @entity87			2
according to @entity45 : " it 's possible to play your @entity0 games on the @entity0 , but no , we have n't announced anything about making any changes to those games in any way or changing how they would appear on the @entity0 " it has no built - in achievement or aggregate scoring system			1
love or hate gamer scores and achievements ? you 'll either love or hate the @entity0 u. while developers are free to include in - game achievements , @entity45 offers no overarching mechanism for tracking games you 've completed or accomplishments within			1
a possible upside for achievement - lovers ? if you 're secretly tired of the compulsive , competitive achievement grind , the @entity0 offers liberation — a chance to go back to playing games for love of the games instead of an arbitrary number			0
@entity0 games are more expensive than @entity0 games			0
@entity0 games sold on average for $ 50			0
@entity0 games will sell on average for $ 60			0
@entity45 's just playing catchup here , so it 's hard to fault the company for raising prices			1
just bear in mind that the total cost of owning a @entity0 over time is going to be notably higher than it was for owning a @entity0			1
the @entity133 is also a tv remote			0
@entity45 places a tv button right on the @entity126			0
press it , and a touchscreen overlay appears , allowing you to change the channel , bring up your tv guide , turn the power on or off , or adjust the volume , all without reaching for your tv 's native remote			0
it 's a modest convenience , but a convenience nonetheless			0
it 's exactly as mobile ( or not ) as @entity45 says it is			2
@entity45 claims the @entity126 works away from the base station up to 24 feet			0
that sounds about right , based on my tests			0
your mileage will vary depending on what 's in your walls , where you put the base station , what else you 're doing ( wirelessly speaking ) , etc. but 24 feet is n't a lot of space , range-wise , meaning the layout of your residence is going to determine whether you can play it in a separate room away from the main one			0
we still have no idea what the online experience is like			0
@entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 are all missing in action at this point , so we have no idea how they work , if they work or what they 'll add to the bottom line			0
with a little luck , @entity45 will remedy this in time for us to talk about this stuff pre-launch , but it 's entirely possible day - one reviews will be limited to commenting on the system and games only			1
@entity293 that in mind if you 're interested in the online features — especially stuff like @entity272 — and awaiting impressions or verdicts .			0

@entity0 , @entity45 's new gaming system , goes on sale sunday
at many retailers , the @entity0 is either long gone or was n't being pre-sold
the @entity0 is much more than just a souped up @entity0 with a tablet controller
total cost of owning a @entity0 over time will be notably higher than for owning a @entity0
