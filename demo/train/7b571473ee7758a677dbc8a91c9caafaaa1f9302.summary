@entity0 , @entity1 -- you 'll have a hard time finding another city in @entity6 whose recent history has been more influenced by the @entity9 than @entity0			1
in the @entity1 capital near the @entity11 -- right where the @entity12 used to divide this town into communist @entity16 and capitalist @entity15 sides -- the @entity9 @entity17 recently set up a plaque commemorating @entity20 's 1987 speech where the 40th president called on then @entity23 leader @entity22 to , " tear down this wall			2
" just a ten minute drive away you reach the former @entity26 , the scene of a major standoff between @entity9 and @entity30 tanks in 1961 that brought the world close to nuclear war			2
and just another ten minutes away you find the city hall of the district of @entity35 , where @entity36 held his famous speech in 1963 , pledging allegiance with this city on the front line of the @entity41 and finishing with the famous words , " @entity43			0
" my own history is reflected in this special relationship @entity0 has with the @entity9 as well			1
in the late 1970 's and early 1980 's my father worked as the @entity0 correspondent for @entity49			2
i went through the @entity50 every morning from @entity51 to get to kindergarten			0
in 1982 we moved to @entity54 , where @entity9 embraced us immediately and we embraced @entity9 culture			2
today , my family and i live in @entity0			2
@entity1 have a lot to thank @entity9 for			1
berliners have a lot to thank @entity9 for			1
it does not mean they have to like all @entity9 policies or the current state of @entity9 politics			1
@entity67 , foreign editor of @entity69 newspaper , says most @entity1 are well informed about the state of the election campaigns			0
" given that @entity9 is still the superpower , people tend to inform themselves quite regularly about the states and @entity9 politics , " @entity67 told @entity2 , noting that a vast majority of @entity1 would vote for the incumbent president if given the option			2
" this is because @entity80 usually are seen to be more in tune with some core @entity6 beliefs regarding welfare , the use of military force , the role of religion in society or social issues such as abortion or gun rights			0
" furthermore , many @entity1 equate @entity92 with the policies of the @entity95 administration -- and positions he staked out during the primary season have toughened many @entity1 ' views of the @entity100 nominee			0
many believe @entity92 will further cut social programs in the @entity9 and repeal @entity103 -- not the most popular stance in a country like @entity1 , which has a very large public health care system			0
in 2008 , then - senator @entity106 used @entity0 as a stage for a major foreign policy speech			0
more than 200,000 berliners and expats showed up to watch the man promising change after eight years of @entity95 alienated many @entity1 -- and led them to fundamentally question whether the @entity9 and @entity6 were finally drifting apart for good			1
now , four years later , the mood is more subdued and the @entity106 hype has cooled down			0
" he has lost some of his appeal and people realized that he could n't deliver the change he promised , " says @entity67 , an assessment many @entity109 would agree with			1
interest in @entity9 politics and the upcoming election is waning not only due to a perceived decline of @entity9 power , but also because @entity1 and @entity6 are grappling with a financial crisis that has propelled @entity1 into the leadership role the country has tried to avoid since the end of @entity131 therefore , it is no surprise that the race for the @entity135 only rarely makes it to the top of the news agenda in @entity1			1
it was may have been front page news after the presidential and vice presidential debates , but the campaign remains buried deep in the " international news " sections on most other days			0
the @entity9 has been all but absent as the @entity146 deals with the biggest economic and identity crisis in its history			1
meanwhile , @entity1 is awkwardly finding itself in the role that the @entity9 used to fulfill for many @entity6 : the major power , hated for seemingly bullying smaller countries to follow its lead , but also admired because it is the only one with the stability and financial firepower to come to terms with the crisis			1
strangely , a tour around @entity0 illustrates this new balance of power as well			0
the plaques , monuments , and historical sites that illustrate @entity9 's sacrifices for this country and this city are still here , but they 're from an era that has passed			0
a new @entity0 has risen and forged for itself a new and very unique identity as a major political and cultural center in the heart of @entity6			1
@entity1 and its capital city have grown up and evolved			0
they will take note of @entity9 politics , but ultimately @entity9 politics will not steer them away from the course they are charting for themselves and for @entity6 .			1

few cities ' recent history has been more influenced by the @entity9 than @entity0
while @entity109 have a lot to thank @entity9 for , that does n't mean they like @entity9 policies
@entity9 policies will not divert @entity0 from charting course of @entity6
