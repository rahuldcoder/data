-- love is all @entity3 needs			1
or so the @entity4 hope			2
the @entity7 doormat - turned - upstart squad from northeastern @entity8 officially got its second big jolt of excitement this offseason on saturday , with the announcement that @entity13 is coming its way in a trade			2
" welcome to the land @ kevinlove ! " @entity3 tweeted			2
@entity13 , who averaged 26.1 points and 12.5 assists a game with the @entity21 , joins @entity3 in @entity4			1
it was @entity3 ' return to the @entity4 -- the club he famously made " @entity26 " to leave four years ago for the @entity25 -- that was the @entity7 's biggest move , by far , since the @entity28 beat the @entity25 for the championship			1
unlike what he 'd done after joining @entity25 , the four - time league @entity30 did n't promise he 'd bring any titles to @entity4			0
part of that may have to do with the fact he did n't have the same supporting cast as he had in @entity25 , where he suited up with @entity38 and @entity39			0
but the arrival of @entity13 -- one of the top scorers and rebounders in the @entity7 -- could change the expectations			0
the two newcomers join a squad that for the past few years has been led by point guard @entity47			0
other holdovers include @entity49 and @entity50			0
still , it 's not like @entity4 last few season have been successful : there 's a reason they had the no. 1 overall draft pick -- which typically goes to one of the @entity7 's worst team -- three of the last four years			1
@entity4 did n't get @entity13 , a forward , for free			1
they gave up two potentially big stars , and their last two no. 1 picks , in @entity61 and @entity62 , to the @entity21			1
the @entity4 surrendered their first - round pick in the 2015 @entity64 to @entity65			0
the 76ers got guard @entity67 and forward @entity68 from @entity21 and traded veteran forward @entity69 to the @entity21 as part of the three - team swap			2
love will wear a new number with @entity4			0

@entity21 trades star @entity13 to the @entity4
he *'ll* team up @entity3 , who *recently* rejoined the @entity4
*timberwolves* get the @entity4 ' last two no. 1 draft picks
