the @entity1 broadcaster @entity0 recently aired a piece of nostalgia that would have brought a tear to the eye of many @entity7 fans			1
it was a 1991 league game between @entity9 and @entity10			1
onto the pitch at @entity9 's imposing @entity13 stadium strode a galaxy of stars , with the likes of @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 strutting their stuff			2
it was a glimpse back to a golden age			0
this was an era of almost fantasy football -- competitive , technical , flamboyant , creative -- and @entity1 basked in the knowledge that its top division was the envy of the world			1
ironically it was @entity7 , and the @entity34 , that played a key role in the resurgence of @entity37 's now all - conquering @entity38			1
in 1991 @entity40 football was still grappling with the aftermath of the @entity43 and @entity44 disasters and many games were played in comparatively dilapidated stadiums under hooliganism 's shadow			1
@entity7 , with its foreign stars and newly - renovated arenas , presented a seductive model to follow			1
fast forward 22 years and things appear to have changed completely			0
@entity7 seems not only to have fallen behind the @entity38 and @entity55 's @entity54 , but also @entity57 's @entity56 and @entity1 's latest usurpers , @entity60 's @entity59			1
drained of its international talent , plagued by corruption scandals and racism controversies , and struggling to update its creaking infrastructure , the once mighty @entity7 looks a pale imitation of its former self			1
historian @entity67 , author of the authoritative " @entity68 , a history of @entity70 " , has observed the @entity1 game 's descent from its 90s peak , and laments its self - inflicted decline			1
" they had a golden goose in the 90s and they killed it , which is incredible really , " @entity67 told @entity75			0
part of @entity7 's financial malaise comes from the way the league 's television rights have been sold			1
while the @entity38 's tv deals swelled its teams ' coffers , @entity1 instead split the rights among individual clubs			1
" the way the league has previously been packaged on television has been disastrous , " says @entity67 , " with clubs acting purely in their own interests			0
" back in the early 90s , @entity97 football fans , relatively starved of football on tv , consumed the freshly aired @entity1 football product with enthusiasm			1
the standard bearer for @entity7 on @entity97 television was broadcaster @entity104 , who can see some signs of positive change in an @entity1 game that has long been in the doldrums			1
" you can see progress " , he says , " and there 's definitely a sense that @entity7 is moving forward ; the problem is that it 's moving fairly slowly			1
" @entity104 's enthusiasm for the @entity1 game remains strong , but he points to the pace of change in other leagues as a cause for concern			1
" you have to view @entity7 's progress in context , " he continued			1
" the thing is that there has been an explosion of money in other leagues			0
" the @entity38 , the @entity56 and now @entity60 have taken things to another level in that respect , so even though @entity7 is improving too , the gap is actually widening			1
there are positives , but they 're positives in a provincial sense			0
" he also points out @entity135 lost its fourth @entity137 spot -- only three @entity1 clubs currently qualify for @entity140 's premier competition , though ironically @entity141 earned the most revenue in last season 's tournament , surpassing even winners @entity145			1
" that was a huge financial blow , and you can see its effect on the second tier of @entity7 clubs , " noted @entity104			2
@entity1 's " old lady " interestingly , a beacon of hope for the league is actually the club that suffered most from the fall - out of 2006 's @entity159 scandal			1
@entity141 was heavily censured by the authorities at the time , but has since undergone a remarkable renaissance , culminating in the construction of an impressive new stadium -- the only club - owned facility in @entity7 that revival saw @entity141 reach the champions @entity168 quarterfinals and also become the first to go unbeaten in @entity7 's new 38 - game format			1
@entity171 says that the club , known in @entity1 as " @entity173 , " has shown others the way forward			2
" @entity141 's success , and their new stadium , has given others a model they can aspire to , " he said			1
" you have to give credit to the way they 've turned things around -- they were in disarray ( after 2006 ) but they 've managed to build a new stadium and a very impressive new team in an incredibly short space of time			0
" aside from its obvious commercial advantages , @entity104 also believes the new stadium has helped @entity141 on the pitch			2
" it has had a huge benefit in terms of revenue , but actually people overlook its impact on atmosphere , " he said			0
" that may well have had a positive effect on their performances on the pitch			0
other clubs can really see that			0
" in fact , several are already taking steps to follow the @entity141 model , with @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity10 all tabling proposals for new stadiums , and @entity218 exploring the idea of moving away from the @entity13			1
of course , this being @entity1 , these proposals are fraught with complexity			2
" it is hard to get things done in @entity1 , especially in the big cities , " explains @entity67			2
" you need the support of local government and it gets very complicated			0
the problem is always local politics			0
the new stadium proposals in @entity231 and @entity9 will be difficult to realize because of that			0
i 'm not sure i can see them happening any time soon			0
" it may be easier in the smaller cities though , so perhaps in somewhere like @entity237 ( home of @entity10 ) there 's a better chance			1
" stamping out racism the most public problem @entity7 has faced in recent months has been the issue of racism , but to the credit of the league , it appears determined to stamp this out			1
most recently , @entity215 has seen its famous @entity248 ( the section of the stadium occupied by its hardcore ultras ) closed by the authorities			0
" shutting the @entity248 is a huge step , " said @entity67			0
" these fans live for that , it 's everything to them , so it 's really hitting them where it hurts			0
" as this most beautiful and cultured of countries readies itself for a new football campaign , there are other indications that @entity7 might finally be getting back on track to compete with @entity140 's big leagues			1
" the stadiums , the fans , the racism issue -- all that needs sorting , " adds @entity171 , " but there are signs that is starting to happen			0
" the crucial thing is the way the league is marketed ; marketing @entity7 as a package , which focuses on the whole league , not just the big teams , has to be the way to drive success			2
" the latest tv deal may not be as lucrative as that of @entity37 's @entity38 , but it is at least far more equitable			0
" @entity7 has finally got its act together on tv rights , " says @entity171 , " and you can also see clubs like @entity288 and @entity289 investing their money wisely or making long - terms plans			2
" indeed , @entity288 have caught the eye this transfer window , and appear ready to put up a serious fight for the @entity295 , not least because of their military style new away kit			0
the departure of @entity300 to @entity301 has been offset with some interesting arrivals , particularly @entity303 from @entity304 , for whose signature @entity288 resisted competition from @entity307 , and the experienced manager @entity308			0
the comparative lack of cash in the @entity1 game has had one positive knock - on effect , however -- the development of young players			2
" there are so many technically gifted , very talented young @entity1 players in @entity7 now , " says @entity67 , " which is the opposite to what 's going on with @entity40 players in the @entity38			1
" you can see the benefit of that in the @entity1 national side , which is very strong and will definitely be challenging for honors at the @entity34			2
" @entity1 also continues to be a production line for managers , with many -- such as @entity327 and @entity328 -- plying their trade successfully outside @entity1 , but plenty more are coming through the ranks			2
" they are always hugely knowledgeable about the game and highly technical " , says @entity171			0
@entity104 also points to a new more attacking outlook that has taken hold , consigning the cliche of defensive " @entity336 " to history			0
" there are managers in @entity7 with much more attacking philosophies now , " enthuses @entity104			2
" @entity341 ( who has joined @entity214 from @entity342 ) is another one in that mold			0
there 's also a commitment to good technical football and tactical excellence that marks the league out			2
" while many @entity350 leagues have become rather predictable , @entity7 also appears to be regaining its competitive edge			2
in the 90s the @entity1 league boasted seven teams that would routinely challenge for the title , known as " @entity355 , " or " @entity356 " -- @entity9 , @entity218 , @entity141 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity357 , and @entity358			1
@entity104 can see the coming years being similarly open			0
" we might not be quite back to those days yet , " he says , " but you can make a case that we 're getting there -- with @entity288 and @entity289 perhaps replacing @entity215 and @entity357			0
" that makes the league really open , and arguably a lot more exciting than say @entity55 , or even @entity57			0
" as for this year 's competition , @entity141 -- who have added @entity368 and @entity369 to their attacking armory -- are firm favorites , but other teams will certainly be interesting to watch			1
" @entity218 may have a long hard season ahead of them ; the new ownership there has pulled the handbrake on transfers at a time when they really need investment , " says @entity104 , " but @entity288 are very interesting , and there 's a lot of potential at @entity9			2
" they have some good young players and the return of @entity386 will help shore them up defensively			0
" @entity358 have a really talented and exciting midfield , and @entity388 is potentially a fantastic asset to add to that , not to mention the return of @entity392			0
those two could make them pretty formidable going forward			0
" the days of @entity7 sitting at the pinnacle of @entity350 football may be in the past , but it is clear that reports of its death have been exaggerated			1
with its mix of youth , new signings , unrivaled technical ability and the inevitable soap opera off the pitch , we could instead be in for a vintage season of @entity1 football .			1
