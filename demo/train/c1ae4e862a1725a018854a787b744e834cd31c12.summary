@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 traveled to @entity4 on thursday after spending two days in @entity1 , where he declared that the @entity5 will increase its military presence and expand its role in shaping the @entity8			1
" our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region , " @entity3 told the @entity1 @entity9			2
" the @entity5 is a @entity8 power , and we are here to stay			1
" he announced an agreement with @entity1 on wednesday that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost @entity5 's presence in the region			1
in a speech a day later , @entity3 made it clear that the military expansion is a top priority in the wake of the @entity28 and @entity29 wars , even as the @entity5 faces the need to reduce mounting federal deficits and debt			1
" as we end today 's wars , i have directed my national security team to make our presence and missions in the @entity8 a top priority , " @entity3 said			1
" as a result , reductions in @entity5 defense spending will not -- i repeat , will not -- come at the expense of the @entity8			2
" the speech on the second day of his two - day trip to @entity1 , @entity3 's first as president , signaled a policy objective to compete head - on with @entity48 for influence in the region while also providing security assurances for allies			1
deputy national security adviser @entity53 told reporters that the policy comes in part from nations of the region seeking increased @entity5 presence			0
" the ability of the @entity5 to help respond to contingencies is something that has been welcomed in recent years , whether , again , it was work that we 're doing in the @entity66 to counter violent extremism , work that we 're doing to counter piracy in the region , the response to the tsunami in @entity4 , " @entity53 said			2
" so in other words , there 's a demand signal from the nations of the region , and this is something that we 're doing in concert with one of our closest allies			0
so we believe it 's not just entirely appropriate , but an important step to dealing with the challenges of the future of the @entity8			2
" under the military agreement announced wednesday , up to 250 @entity5 @entity84 will be sent to @entity86 and the northern region of @entity1 for military exercises and training			1
over the next several years their numbers are expected to climb to 2,500 -- a full @entity84 ground task force			0
@entity5 quietly builds military capabilities in @entity8 in addition , air force maj. gen. @entity93 , director of strategic planning and policy for the @entity96 , told journalists in a telephone call wednesday from @entity100 that the @entity5 has based some of its most sophisticated weapons in the @entity8 , including squadrons of f - 22 fighters and c - 17 transport planes			1
the f - 22s provide leading - edge technology for potential air - to - air combat as well as cyber- and electronic warfare , " @entity93 said			0
they replaced older f - 15s , he added			0
while @entity5 officials cited the need to respond to regional natural disasters as a reason for the agreement , concern over @entity48 's military expansion is widely acknowledged as a driving factor			1
" what we look at is how does our general force posture allow us to protect @entity5 interests , protect our allies , and ... secure the region broadly , " @entity53 said			0
" @entity48 is obviously a piece of the @entity8 , an emerging power			1
" @entity53 later added that the deal is " part of the @entity5 sending a signal that we 're going to be present , that we 're going to continue to play the role of underpinning security in this part of the region			0
part of that context is a rising @entity48			0
" in @entity48 , a foreign ministry spokesman questioned the appropriateness of an increased @entity5 military presence in @entity1			1
analysts note that the deal sends a message to @entity48 in a less confrontational way than building up bases closer to @entity48 shores			2
" the @entity48 can squawk about it , " said @entity148 , senior director of the @entity149 at the @entity150			0
" but it 's not like having an aircraft carrier in the @entity154			0
" @entity3 said during a wednesday news conference that " the notion that we fear @entity48 is mistaken			2
" before departing @entity1 , the president , along with some @entity84 , visited a military base in @entity86			1
while speaking to the troops there , @entity3 thanked them for their service and praised the two nations ' alliance , which is now 60 years old , and said he looks forward to a deepening of the alliance			0
going forward , our purpose is the same as it was 60 years ago -- " the preservation of peace and security			0
and in a larger sense , you 're answering the question once posed by the great @entity174			0
of @entity1 , he wrote , " hath she the strength for the burden laid upon her , hath she the power to protect and guard her own ? " the president 's @entity1 visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the @entity184 and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the @entity8 as @entity48 expands its military reach and the @entity5 works to reduce its military footprint in @entity189			1
@entity3 's @entity1 visit comes on the heels of last weekend 's 19 - nation @entity193 summit , which highlighted the need for new measures supporting job growth			2
during the @entity199 summit , @entity3 stressed the importance of the @entity8 to global economic security , and he pushed @entity48 to do more to help strengthen the world economy			1
@entity2 's @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 contributed to this report			0

" the @entity5 is a @entity8 power , " @entity3 says in @entity1
up to 2,500 @entity5 @entity84 will be *deployed* near @entity86
deal with @entity1 sends a message in light of @entity48 's growing military power
the president will wrap up his @entity8 trip with a stop in @entity4
