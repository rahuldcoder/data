transcript this is a @entity19			2
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity23 , @entity24 : it 's monday , i 'm @entity27 , and this is @entity0 ! thank you for joining us			1
we 're gon na start things off with a quick check of some headlines			2
first up : headlines @entity35 : fierce battles are still raging in northwestern @entity37 , where the country 's military is waging an assault against @entity42 forces			1
officials say as many as 200 members of the militant group were killed in a single day over the weekend			2
@entity0 ca n't confirm that information , because journalists are n't allowed in the region			2
the @entity49 is concerned about this impact on civilians			2
hundreds of thousands of @entity37 are leaving the area to try and get away from the violence			2
and in @entity55 , firefighters are getting some help from the weather as they battle that blaze in @entity59			2
authorities say low winds and increased humidity are helping to keep the flames under control			2
the fire , which had destroyed or damaged about 80 homes , was at least 55 percent contained by sunday			2
@entity3 @entity2 @entity35 : and @entity3 is celebrating the end of @entity68 with its 64th annual @entity69			1
the occasion , which took place on saturday , marks the date in 1945 when @entity73 officially surrendered to the former @entity74 , which @entity3 was part of at the time			1
as @entity78 shows us , the weekend ceremony gave @entity3 an opportunity to show off its military might			1
( @entity82 ) @entity83 , @entity0 correspondent : well , this is the biggest show of force in @entity3 since the collapse of the @entity74			1
columns of tanks and missile launchers thundered over the cobblestones of @entity91 in the center of @entity93 for these @entity69 celebrations , marking the defeat of @entity73 but also reflecting the @entity97 's efforts to revive @entity3 's armed forces and global power			1
well , opening the parade , @entity3 's president @entity100 told spectators that @entity3 's military is ready to respond to any aggression , and he referred obliquely to the country 's brief war with the neighboring former @entity74 republic of @entity108 last year			1
@entity100 , president of @entity3 ( @entity110 ) : now more than ever , it is clear a safe world is possible only where international law is strictly abided by			1
and that is why our country has initiated a new treaty on @entity119 security			2
security based on safe arms control and reasonable sufficiency of military construction for the broadest cooperation of states and the exclusively peaceful settlement of conflicts			1
and we will firmly pursue the execution of these principles			0
chance : about 9,000 troops took part in a display of military equipment which , for the first time , included state - of - the - art @entity137 air defense missiles , which the @entity138 and others is concerned may be sold to @entity140			1
@entity3 also rolled out its new @entity142 intercontinental ballistic missiles , a stock reminder that this fast country remains a formidable nuclear power			1
@entity78 , @entity0 , @entity93			0
( @entity146 ) @entity147 @entity148 , @entity24 : see if you can i.d. me ! i first appeared in the @entity138 in the late 1600s			0
i 'm a printed item that 's usually published daily or weekly			1
i 've been a major source of news for millions of people around the world			1
i 'm the newspaper , the answer to that old joke , " what 's black and white and read all over ? " @entity7 ? @entity35 : except newspapers are n't being read as much these days			1
in fact , at least 120 of them have closed in the @entity138 since january of 2008			0
one reason : readers are getting their news for free online at sites like @entity168			1
but a major media tycoon who just happens to own some newspapers , says the days of free , online content could be coming to an end			1
@entity173 covers the unfolding issue			0
( @entity82 ) @entity173 , @entity0 correspondent : @entity175 has floated the idea that some of his general newspapers , like the @entity179 , the @entity177 or @entity178 , could follow the model of his @entity184 and charge readers for online content			1
but with content free for so long , will people pay ? woman on the street # 1 : no , probably not			1
you can find almost all the same information somewhere			0
woman on the street # 2 : no. i would look somewhere else			0
@entity193 : though mr. @entity175 will be happy to hear this man would pay for his @entity177 online			1
@entity196 : just because it 's quicker and easier to get it online when you are at home			1
@entity193 : still , some do n't even bother to view the free stuff			1
woman on the street # 3 : @entity204			0
@entity205 : actual physical newspapers			0
@entity193 : many news sites , like the @entity208 , ask users to register for free			1
that information can tell potential advertisers who uses the site and for how long			0
the @entity214 does charge those who do n't get the physical paper for a little bit of premium content			1
others , like @entity220 , hold back a lot			0
@entity222 , ceo , @entity223 : the high grade , the high octane stuff we really reserve for our professional customers			0
so , they 've always paid on a subscription basis and we never make that content free , because it 's vital for people to their jobs			1
@entity193 : the @entity234 also charges for anyone wanting to go beyond the basics			0
it currently has 110,000 paid subscribers			0
managing director @entity239 wants to enhance its charging model			1
@entity242 , @entity234 : i am very , very interested in exploring some of the possibilities around micro payments , either for individual articles or for access to the site for a shorter period of time			0
and i think we ought to have a pricing model which actually suits how each individual user wants to access the site			0
@entity193 : the @entity234 points out that it can count on subscriptions and focus on increasing those with advertising eroding , something sites that do n't charge ca n't fall back on			0
that is why @entity175 's @entity261 empire is keen to see if people will pay to play			1
( @entity146 ) @entity263 @entity264 , @entity24 : time for the shoutout ! when did the @entity266 send its first pictures back to @entity14 ? was it in : a ) 1980 , @entity269 ) 1985 , c ) 1990 or @entity270 ) 1995 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity266 has been taking pictures since 1990 , although initial problems caused its first images to be fuzzy			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! final visit @entity35 : despite some early setbacks , the @entity266 has revolutionized the field of astronomy			1
@entity14 's atmosphere , look up and you 'll see it , makes it difficult for astronomers on the ground to get a complete view of things in outer space			1
but from its orbit outside the atmosphere , @entity266 has a perfect spot			0
@entity294 is getting ready to upgrade the telescope			0
@entity296 explains how they plan to do it			0
( @entity82 ) @entity299 , @entity0 correspondent : for nearly twenty years , the @entity266 has been sending back breathtaking images of galaxies and stars and planets			0
it has transformed how astronomers and cosmologists view the universe and our place in it			1
@entity309 , shuttle atlantis mission specialist : where do planetary systems , where do stars come from ? @entity266 has been a tool to answer these fundamental questions that get right at the heart of who we are			1
@entity320 : now , a team of astronauts will make the fifth and final visit to repair and upgrade @entity266			0
the objective : extend the telescope 's life at least another five years			2
it wo n't be easy			0
the pressure on the shuttle @entity330 crew , immense			0
@entity332 , shuttle atlantis commander : we know there 's nobody coming after us to do anything we do n't get done			2
we either get it done or it does n't happen			0
@entity320 : 350 miles up , @entity330 will chase down and grab hold of the telescope			0
for five consecutive days during five seven - hour spacewalks , astronauts will perform the ultimate high - wire act			0
they 'll change out gyroscopes and batteries , repair and replace cameras			0
they 'll change circuit boards , remove dozens of screws and delicately cut through aluminum			0
@entity353 : it 's almost as if i 'm not doing it			2
it 's kind of a @entity359 thing , and once we finish the task and i climb back out of the telescope , i 'll look around and go , " wow , we 're in space			1
" @entity320 : @entity266 has been such an incredible watershed of knowledge , the dark days right after its launch in 1990 have largely been forgotten			0
@entity368 , retired shuttle astronaut : there was a time when @entity266 was a laughing stock			0
you know , the " techno turkey			0
" you know , pictures in editorial cartoons , denounced on the floors of @entity379 , ridiculed in late night television programs			0
@entity320 : the telescope 's primary mirror was flawed , not quite the right shape , off a measly 1/50 , the thickness of a sheet of paper , but just enough to blur the images from space			1
the first servicing mission fixed the problem , saving the @entity266 program			2
now , 19 years later , the last visit			0
@entity393 : that 's been the wonderful thing about the ability to service @entity266 , is that we do n't just repair it			2
we leave it a new telescope every time we come back			0
@entity353 : it 's impossible not to give it some human characteristics and feel sadness when we see it floating away			2
@entity320 : if all goes well , scientists expect the new and improved @entity266 will soon wow them and us with discoveries perhaps beyond our dreams			0
@entity296 , @entity0 , at the @entity410 in @entity411			0
( @entity146 ) before we go @entity35 : we 're gon na end this show with a bang ! instant replay ! one more time ! after all that excitement , let 's cool off with some soda			1
that 's why you do n't shake it up first			2
now it might be hard to swallow , but this is actually part of the world 's largest physics lesson , with more than 7,000 students taking part in the scientific spectacle			2
goodbye @entity35 : makes sense , using exploding soda bottles to study fizz - ics			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity27 .			0
