-- if the @entity2 leave you cold , then we are here to help			0
ahead of friday 's opening ceremony in @entity5 , let us thaw your icy hearts with 10 reasons why you should watch the snow men and ice queens compete at the @entity10			1
lessons in luge had your fill of football ? tired of tennis ? then help is at hand for the next three weeks			0
once every four years , mainstream sports make way for the obscure delights of bobsleigh and biathlon , curling and luge			0
there is even more novelty at the @entity10 , with 12 new events joining the @entity2 program , including ski and snowboard slopestyle and ski halfpipe competitions			1
slopestyle is similar to skateboarding on snow , as athletes use rails , pipes and jumps to make their way down the course			1
the halfpipe ski athletes are also set to wow the crowd as they perform tricks in the center of an icy ramp measuring 234 meters in length and 7 meters deep ! @entity45 what do you get if you combine snow , ice and high - speed sport ? the answer is accidents			1
the @entity2 provide plenty of " oohs and aahs " for a willing audience as the athletes try to avoid injury , and not always successfully			2
" at the last @entity2 ( in @entity62 2010 ) i was one of the statistics , " @entity60 snowboard cross star @entity59 , who regularly travel down the slopes at 50 mph , told @entity0			2
" i damaged the cartilage to my knee but one girl broke her back			0
other typical snowboard - cross injuries are broken ankles , concussion , pretty much torn ligaments in your entire body and broken bones all over as well			1
" it can be quite gruesome			0
" a study by the @entity77 following the @entity78 found bobsleigh , ice hockey , short - track skating , freestyle skiing and snowboard cross were the most injury - prone sports			1
but the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) told @entity0 that , although the severity of injuries differ , a surprisingly similar number of athletes are hurt at the @entity91 and @entity78 , with 10 - 11 % of all athletes in 2010 and 2012 picking up an injury			1
hot and cold competitors once every four years the @entity2 surprise us with the fact that sizzling nations , who know no snow , send teams to compete on the white stuff			0
the a-z of countries who have already qualified for @entity5 includes @entity108 hot spots @entity106 and @entity109 , the @entity111 island of @entity112 and the @entity113			1
these athletes from tropical nations often warm the hearts of tv audiences looking for an underdog to cheer on			2
that was the case in 1988 when the haphazard @entity121 bobsleigh team brought some sunshine to the @entity123 and inspired the cult film " @entity125			0
" after a 12 - year absence , @entity121 is set to compete in the two - man bob after @entity128 and @entity129 used crowd funding to help pay their way to @entity5			1
@entity133 who ? @entity136 ski queen @entity135 may be gone from the @entity5 but there is still an avalanche of alpine stars to support			1
@entity141 snowboarder @entity140 -- like @entity142 already a household name in the @entity136 -- and @entity146 's superstar speed skater @entity144 are going for a " three - peat " in @entity148			1
@entity144 , the first black athlete from any nation to win an individual @entity2 title , and @entity140 are both aiming to do what no other @entity136 male has done before -- win three successive gold medals			0
at @entity78 , more than 29 million @entity136 tuned in to watch @entity140 , @entity142 and @entity144 triumph -- and the prime - time coverage of the @entity10 even managed to end the six - year streak of " @entity158 " at the top of the @entity136 tv ratings ! there are plenty of global stars to watch , too			1
the grace and speed of ice dancing queen @entity167 kim yu - na is not to be missed while best - selling violinist @entity169 swaps her bow for ski poles as she represents @entity172 in the slalom			1
hockey heroes will the world witness another " @entity176 " at the @entity10 ? there 's only one way to find out -- watch the @entity2 ice hockey competition			0
the @entity136 's victory over an all - conquering @entity182 side at the 1980 @entity183 is frozen in time as a classic @entity186 encounter , and it also helped the @entity136 men go on to win an unlikely gold medal			2
four years ago in @entity62 , the men 's ice hockey final served up some more red - hot action on the ice as @entity193 edged a 4 - 3 victory over the @entity136 in overtime			2
the @entity2 provides a rare opportunity to see some of the @entity198 's top names compete on a global stage			0
@entity201 " @entity200 -- reportedly the highest - paid player in the @entity198 -- will captain defending champion @entity193			2
get your skates on who needs spoof movie classic " @entity208 " or television 's " @entity209 " when you can marvel over the real ice queens , and kings , on the rink in @entity148 ? @entity136 @entity215 is credited as the father of figure skating after he sprinkled a dose of ballet moves to his skating routines in the late 1800s , and now today 's ice dancing duos express themselves with music from " @entity223 " to @entity224			1
if you thought the moonwalk was hard , just imagine doing it in ice skates			0
for those of you whose legs turn to jelly during the annual @entity235 trip to the ice rink , the speed skating events offer reassurance that @entity2 skaters fall over too			2
@entity239 skated into @entity10 legend when he won gold at @entity242 in 2002			0
the @entity243 watched his rivals ahead of him tumble out in the 1,000m short track final and cruised through to win , becoming the first athlete from the southern hemisphere to win @entity2 gold			0
inspiration generation the @entity250 set out to inspire a generation , but it is arguably the @entity78 which are attracting a younger , hipper audience			2
" the sports that have recently come into the @entity2 are the sports that young people are getting into , " explains snowboarder @entity59 , who says the majority of her fans tend to be between the ages of 12 and 20			2
" sports like snowboard cross , slopestyle and ski halfpipe are definitely the ones that young people are going to be watching			1
" the @entity86 , however , says that it does not have a demographic breakdown of its audience			0
the @entity266 the @entity5 have been dubbed the " @entity266 " -- and @entity148 's sport - loving president @entity267 has staked his personal reputation on their success			1
addressing the @entity86 in 2007 in support of @entity5 's bid to become host , he said : " it is a unique place			1
on the seashore you can enjoy a fine spring day			0
but up in the mountains it 's winter			0
i went skiing there six or seven weeks ago , and i know			0
" since winning the bid , $ 50 billion and rising has been splashed on @entity148 's first @entity78 , making them the most expensive @entity2 in history			1
@entity267 has personally overseen the final preparations and in january he again went skiing in @entity5 , although he did n't test out the @entity2 courses			2
the 61 - year - old , a keen horseman and judoka , also plays ice hockey and has tried his hand at bobsleigh			0
surely the @entity78 are worth watching if only to see if @entity148 's president pops up as a surprise entry in one of the events ? @entity300 language if you fancy a @entity302 , a mctwist or a @entity304 should you head to one of @entity5 's eateries or the snowboarding slopes ? the @entity2 is a chance to limber up your alpine lexicon and impress your friends with tongue - twisting terminology			1
a guddle or a hog line might sound like something out of @entity315 but they are actually @entity317 - inspired curling terms , while ice dancing carries the threat of death spirals , camel spins and shooting the duck			0
winter warmer if you still need convincing to watch this month 's @entity2 , then will the chance to feel warm and fuzzy do the trick ? while the alpine stars brave frozen slopes and numbing ice , why not throw another log on the fire , stir another hot chocolate , fill a hot water bottle and feel nice and snug -- and a little smug -- as you watch their sporting feats from the comfort of your sofa .			0

the @entity5 takes place in the @entity148 resort of @entity5 on 7 - 23 *february*
there are 12 new events in @entity5 including the hip sport of slopestyle and ski halfpipe
the @entity78 can be *dangerous* with 10 - 11 % of athletes picking up injuries
@entity148 has spent $ 50 billion , and rising , on the @entity5
