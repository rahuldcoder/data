-- to ask what impact @entity1 has had on computing is , in a way , too small a question			1
for millions of people in the nearly four decades since he co-founded @entity8 , @entity1 has defined the entire field			1
whether browsing the web on @entity12 on a pc running @entity14 or working up a powerpoint presentation with @entity16 before taking a break to game on the @entity19 , there are many among us whose entire digital experience have been filtered through products @entity1 helped create			2
on tuesday , @entity1 took what may be his final step away from leadership of @entity8			1
with the announcement that @entity29 , a 22 - year veteran of the company , will take over as ceo , the company also said @entity1 is stepping down as chairman of its board of directors			1
@entity1 co-founded the company with @entity35 in 1975 but stepped down as ceo in 2000			1
he then spent eight years as @entity8 's chairman before stepping away from full - time work there in 2008 to focus on his charitable work through the @entity40			1
rather than exiting the stage at the world 's largest computer software company , @entity1 may actually be getting more active			1
he 'll take on a new role as an adviser to @entity29 , putting him back on @entity8 's @entity46 , @entity47 , campus more often			1
it will also put him nearer to the heart of innovation the company will need to keep up with rivals like @entity53 and @entity54 at the top of the consumer - tech industry			0
if he succeeds in helping @entity8 get back its swagger , particularly in a fast - growing mobile world dominated by @entity53 and @entity54 and in the increasingly important field of cloud computing , it would be a final contribution to a career that has virtually defined an industry			1
" @entity1 is one of the pioneering giants of the information age , " said @entity65 , a software and hardware analyst at @entity68			2
" driven by the belief in a computer in every home , on every desktop , he helped to build one of the largest firms in the world to achieve that goal -- and arguably succeeded			2
" for starters , @entity8 was the world 's first real software company			1
although there are hours of bare - knuckle geek brawling to be done over whether @entity1 and @entity8 or rival @entity84 and @entity53 were the true innovators on early computer interfaces , there 's no question as to who succeeded in making software for the masses			1
the result was something approximating that computer - on - every - desk dream			0
by making software a money - maker for itself and third - party developers , @entity8 helped retailers sell computers for less , making them accessible to more of the public			2
whether it was @entity101 for early @entity103 machines or the more seismic release of @entity14 in 1985 , @entity1 was behind them all			2
despite his reputation as an aggressive -- some would say predatory -- businessman , he has never been confused with a numbers guy who leaves the real work up to subordinates			0
@entity1 wrote his first computer program , a tic - tac - toe game , at age 14 and formed his first company , again with @entity35 , at 17			1
in @entity8 's early years , he wrote every line of code for the company 's software while managing its business side			1
in that way , he set himself apart from rival @entity84 , who had a brilliant sense of design but was never much of a software engineer			0
@entity1 ' exacting product reviews were legendary within @entity8 , a fact that observers say puts him in a select fraternity of two in the computer world			1
" the more time @entity1 spends on product development , the better , " @entity134 , author of the technology marketing book " @entity136 , " told the @entity137			2
" he and @entity84 seem very different on the outside , but at their core , they were very similar			0
they both see things that others do n't see , and they 're both very demanding			0
" as the years went on , @entity8 products continued to become more ubiquitous -- so much so that the company 's seeming stranglehold on the computing world led to monopoly claims and antitrust lawsuits in the late ' 90s and early 2000s			1
despite @entity53 's inroads , @entity14 continues to have more than 1.3 billion active users worldwide			0
@entity153 , part of the massively popular @entity16 of productivity tools , has joined the likes of @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 in the pantheon of brand names used synonymously with an entire category of products			0
many pc users have probably never created a document without @entity165 , and number - crunchers everywhere would be lost without @entity168 's spreadsheets			0
@entity8 's @entity169 , despite becoming seen as unfashionable by younger users , remained the world 's most popular free e-mail service until 2012 , when it was passed by @entity173 before @entity8 merged it with @entity175			1
and of course there 's the @entity19 , which became one of the gaming industry 's " @entity180 " consoles , along with @entity182 's @entity181 and @entity184 's @entity183 , upon its release in 2001			0
thirteen years later , the new @entity186 continues to do battle with the @entity183 for the hearts and wallets of gamers			0
all were delivered under the guidance of @entity1			2
" the pervasiveness of information technology was by no means clear when he began driving to it , " @entity65 said			0
" and today it is a fact of life , embedded into everyone 's life to a degree that only science - fiction writers imagined when he was building his first software			0
" will @entity1 ' new role mean a batch of new products that we 'll still be talking about 10 or 20 years from now ? that may be a stretch			2
but in a video message posted online tuesday , @entity1 said he 'll be " substantially increasing " the time he spends at @entity8			1
and he sounds up to the challenge			0
" @entity8 has a long history of innovation , going back to the beginning , where the vision of the personal computer was something that @entity8 helped bring to life , " he said			0
" our vision of the platform ... really initiated the entire software industry			0
" as the industry changes , we have to innovate to move forward , " he said			0
" it 'll be fun to define this next round of products working together			0

@entity1 is stepping down as chairman of @entity8 's board
but he 'll actually be there more as an adviser to new ceo
under @entity1 , @entity8 has defined the computing world
@entity1 ' company has defined desktop and workplace computing
