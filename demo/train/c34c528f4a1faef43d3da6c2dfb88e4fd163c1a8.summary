@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity4 decides not to run for president -- and yes , that is still possible -- her return to the media lion 's den might be a factor in her thinking			1
she 's done a national book tour and the paid lecture circuit , but @entity12 got an up - close look at today 's frenzied political news environment last weekend when she visited @entity1 for the first time in seven years , a spectacle primed for an avalanche of media coverage given her expected campaign and her tortured history with the @entity1			1
i joined more than 200 other reporters who swarmed the scene and tweeted away , even though most @entity25 on social media that day probably cared more about @entity27 's ankle			1
the press scrum that assembled to witness noncandidates @entity4 and @entity12 flip @entity31 steaks with sen. @entity32 -- behind a barricade , of course -- was as large , if not larger , than the media hordes that covered her at the height of her 2008 campaign			1
one reporter got whacked in the head with the butt of a big television camera			2
another photographer dramatically toppled off his ladder while straining to get a shot			2
it was a little absurd			2
when the @entity48 approached the media zoo for question time , @entity12 leaned in and relished the scene			2
political @entity53 , though , was n't just a stream of gauzy @entity56 - filtered pics of the @entity48 : it was also rife with media criticism , some fair and some not , from politicos and press critics who pointed to the event as another example of lazy " pack journalism " with little journalistic upside			0
the sniping had some credibility			0
what was the competitive advantage of being there , just one more reporter among the herd , all of us racing around to get the same quotes and the same pictures ? this was especially true for the many journalists in attendance who rarely travel outside of @entity79 or @entity80 to cover politics but decided to open up their travel budget for this one trip			1
could n't their time have been better spent reporting on an undercovered @entity86 or governor 's race in some other part of the country , far away from the rest of the media scrum ? of course , the academics would say			1
but the incentive structure of today 's click - driven news economy begs to differ			1
@entity98 ' @entity97 does not			0
this is the world we live in			0
as much as i believe in straying far , far away from the rest of the media pack -- this was a lynchpin argument in " did @entity108 ? , " the @entity103 study i wrote last year about the hyperactive political news media -- i did find value in covering the @entity111			0
for one , i lived @entity12 's 2008 campaign up close as an embedded producer for @entity2 , living on her campaign plane for six months and ingesting every single stump speech , gaffe and gross turkey sandwich in front of me			1
it was useful for me to see whether her political skills and her willingness to play the @entity1 game had shifted since she lost the nomination fight to @entity125			1
the whole thing was broadcast on @entity2 and @entity127 , which is fine and good , but television cameras do n't pick up the small things reporters can sniff on the ground : the receptiveness of the crowd , the impressive organizational prowess of the once - meager @entity135 , the absurdity of the staged photo - ops and press scrums , and the rope - line body language of @entity12 herself , which was noticeably more cautious than her husband @entity140 ( some things never change )			1
those are the kind of atmospherics i chose to focus on when crafting my report from the scene as well as this week 's episode of @entity148			2
and of course , there 's the reporting that went on nowhere near the @entity111 , those meetings with @entity152 and @entity154 sources in and around @entity0			2
was all that worth the plane ticket to @entity156 ? definitely			0
will i go somewhere where other reporters are n't for my next trip ? you bet			2
watching the @entity1 theatrics from afar , the journalist @entity161 wrote that @entity4 's protocandidacy is a " problem for the media , which simultaneously is ready right now to cover her like a nominee -- 200 reporters ! -- and yet so palpably bored with how she talks , and runs			1
" but the ever - growing press corps , weaponized by @entity53 , will also be a problem for @entity12 and her team , who must find ways of engaging with a massive entourage of reporters that is constantly on the hunt for " news " -- i.e. , anything off - message or click - worthy -- while also trying to drive the conversation on their own terms			0
the hyperguarded @entity185 encountered this same dilemma during his ill - fated 2012 presidential bid			0
watch more @entity188 when he avoided the press , he got punished by a cranky and access - starved press corps			0
when he held a rare press conference to push a policy idea , his comments were drowned out by a cacophony of horse - race questions or some @entity53 - driven " controversy " unfolding hundreds of miles away			0
so he chose to get his message out on his own terms , through paid media or friendly @entity203 interviews , without the filter of the " traditional " press , whatever that means			0
in the end , it was n't enough			0
that political reporters are motivated by conflict , personality and the ups - and - downs of a campaign is nothing new , and it 's unlikely to change despite carping from media critics			2
what has changed is the atomized and hyperactive social news environment we all live in now , and it 's changed dramatically since @entity12 last announced a presidential bid in 2007 , before the @entity220 existed and well before @entity53 took hold among the political class			1
if she runs again , there will be reporters covering her campaign who were barely in diapers when @entity12 was elected president , who came of age in an era of internet journalism that prizes exclusives and micronews , who have very different incentives than the television and newspaper reporters that the @entity48 dealt with during his presidency or her last campaign			0
they hold the @entity48 in high - regard , but not nearly as high as the regard the @entity48 have for themselves			0
@entity4 got a taste of this during her book tour -- her de-facto re-entry into political life -- when various comments that had even a whiff of controversy or gaffe - status rocketed across the internet at warp speed , with an assist from @entity154 opposition researchers			1
life as a candidate , of course , is something much different			0
but her @entity1 pop - in was her first glimpse of the thorny new reality that awaits .			1

@entity268 is a weekly *digital* show produced by @entity270 and @entity2 @entity271
@entity4 made her first trip to @entity1 since losing to @entity125 and @entity274 in 2008
@entity4 gets a hard look at what 's ahead and what 's changed if she decides to run
