the terrorist attack on a natural gas installation at @entity2 in eastern @entity3 may be an isolated act of revenge for the @entity7 intervention in @entity8 -- or an ominous portent of things to come in @entity11 , where @entity13 militancy is gaining traction fast			1
the man claiming responsibility for the operation is a veteran jihadist who is also renowned for hostage - taking and smuggling anything from cigarettes to refugees			1

counter-terrorism experts differ as to how the attackers - in several pickup trucks - may have reached in @entity2 , but there are several roads and tracks across uninhabited desert from @entity58			1
on the other side of the border , a patchwork of militia prevails rather than any government presence			0
a spokesman for @entity71 told @entity73 news websites that the attack was in retaliation for @entity3 permitting @entity7 overflights as part of the intervention in @entity8			1
but regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in days			1
@entity81 , a former @entity82 diplomat who was abducted by @entity28 's followers in @entity84 in 2008 -- and met the man himself -- told @entity86 , " i suspect they have an intelligence wing and they are constantly looking for ways to grab westerners and embarrass the @entity92 and confuse our options			1
and that 's exactly what they are doing			0

" this is a promise from us that we will fight you in the midst of your countries and we will attack your interests , " he said			2
announcing the formation of an elite commando unit called " @entity115 , " @entity28 said it would be the shield against the " invading enemy			1
" wednesday 's attack in @entity3 was claimed in the name of that unit , which @entity28 said would include " the best of our youth and mujahideen , foreign and local supporters			1
" counter-terrorism analysts tell @entity86 the language suggests this group was dispatched to carry out an act of jihad rather than abduct foreigners for ransom			2
watch : @entity13 militants attack oil field , two dead " this feels much more like attacks staged in the past by other @entity38 affiliates , rather than another attempt to exchange hostages for ransom , as has often been @entity39 's practice , " said @entity133 , a long - time observer of @entity39 currently in @entity134			1
" @entity143 likely wants to show he is still engaged in active operations and he is not moving away from the fighting - especially at a time when other jihadists are in active combat against @entity7 troops in @entity8 , " he said			1
but it is also possible that @entity28 may try to bargain for the release of @entity38 operatives held in @entity3 jails			2
in his december message , he said , " to our captive people ... it is our promise and our debt as long as we live that we will liberate you , and we sacrifice our lives for you and everything we own to free you			2
" three @entity38 operatives were detained last july by @entity3 security services , but it 's not known whether they were close to @entity165			0

he traveled to @entity31 in 1991 in his late teens to fight its then @entity173 government			0
he returned to @entity3 as a hardened fighter with a new nickname " @entity176 " -- the " one - eyed " -- after a battlefield injury , and joined forces with the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) in its brutal campaign against the @entity3 regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters			1
@entity28 later claimed he met @entity38 founder @entity184 in the @entity185 in the mid 1990s			2
according to @entity187 , a @entity7 scholar who has extensively studied @entity39 , @entity186 rose steadily through the ranks to become the @entity179 commander for the @entity190			1
after a popular backlash against the terrorist group in @entity3 , @entity28 switched allegiance to a spin - off group -- the @entity39 -- in 2000 , and continued to operate in the @entity196 region			1
the @entity179 was the forerunner of @entity39 , which still counts many @entity3 in its leadership			0
@entity28 remains associated with this fissiparous group -- but is very much his own man			1
@entity200 , the overall leader of @entity39 , is said to have demoted @entity28 late last year from his position as ' emir of the @entity203			2
' @entity28 also feuded with a rival commander - @entity204 - one of the most violent and radical figures in @entity39			1
more than most @entity38 affiliates , @entity39 is divided into often competing groups			0
citing regional security officials , @entity208 reported @entity28 had been dismissed for " continued divisive activities , despite several warnings			2
" @entity58 sources tell @entity86 that @entity143 spent several months in @entity58 in 2011 , exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups , and securing weapons supplies			0
one @entity217 media report - cited in a @entity220 @entity219 report last year - said @entity28 had attended an event organized by @entity222 , an @entity13 commander , in the town of @entity224			1
there is no way to verify that			0
more recently , his center of operations was the dusty town of @entity231 in northern @entity8			0
another offshoot of @entity39 known as the @entity233 and @entity234 has taken over @entity231 and introduced @entity236 law , including public amputations and floggings			0
to make money , " @entity28 increasingly engaged in smuggling , earning the popular nickname ' mr. @entity241 ' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs , weapons , and illegal immigrants , " @entity187 in a 2010 @entity248			1
a wide theater criminality helped fund jihad			0
in december 2007 , @entity28 's followers murdered four @entity7 tourists in @entity73			1
two months later , they carried out a drive - by shooting on the @entity256 embassy in @entity257 , @entity73 's capital			2
" we set an ambush to kill the ambassador of the @entity264 entity in @entity73 before attacking the compound that housed the embassy and the nightclub that the ambassador was present in minutes before the attack , " @entity28 told a @entity73 journalist in november 2011			1
despite @entity220 satellite surveillance and the deployment of @entity3 and @entity73 troops to vulnerable areas , @entity38 affiliates in the @entity203 have grown in strength			0
the vast distances and empty landscapes - as well as a complex relationship with local tribes - play to their advantage			0
borders are difficult to seal : the rugged @entity3 - @entity8 frontier is as long as the distance from @entity284 to @entity285			2
in february 2012 , a cache of @entity288 missiles - looted from @entity58 armories - was discovered buried in the desert not far from in @entity2			0
@entity133 says the weapons - @entity297 nd sa - 24 " seem to have been at a midway point in the delivery process , " their destination and customer unknown			0
many @entity39 figures - @entity165 and @entity204 included - know the region minutely			0
indeed , @entity133 says some suspect that it was relatives of @entity204 who kidnapped a local @entity3 official a year ago - bundling him across the border into @entity58			0
in the view of one @entity58 source with close contacts among the region 's jihadists , @entity28 has often been a thorn in the side of @entity39 's leadership			2
" he was seen as a loose canon , running things in his own way , " the source told @entity86 recently			0
" and the last thing the leadership wanted was to antagonize the @entity220 just when it was trying to build up strength by stealth , below the radar			0
" however the hostage stand - off is resolved , that strategy has now been blown to pieces .			0
