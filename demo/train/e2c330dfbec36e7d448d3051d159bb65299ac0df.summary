-- @entity1 became @entity3 's youngest world champion in a five - way shootout at the season - ending @entity5 in november 2010 , and the @entity7 needs just one point in @entity9 this weekend to seal a second world crown			1
@entity1 's dominant form in 2011 has led him to victory in nine of 14 races so far , and the 24 - year - old is on the brink of becoming the ninth driver to secure back - to - back titles in the championship 's 61 - year history			1
if he does so , the celebrations will come with four races to go -- putting @entity1 narrowly behind his legendary compatriot @entity22 , who set the standard in 2002 when he clinched the fifth of his record seven world titles with six of the 17 races remaining			2
@entity1 will also become the youngest double world champion , beating the 25 - year - old @entity30 's feat with @entity31 in 2005 - 06			1
latest f1 standings after @entity33 former @entity34 driver @entity1 needs to earn a 10th - place finish , or higher , in one of the season 's five remaining grands prix to complete his triumph			1
@entity41 's 2009 world champion @entity40 , second in the drivers ' standings , is the only driver who still has a mathematical chance of preventing @entity47 celebrations on sunday			1
@entity48 racer @entity40 would need the unlikely combination of @entity1 to score no further world championship points , while also winning the year 's five remaining races			1
despite @entity1 knowing he could win the title with an uncharacteristically low finish -- he has finished outside of the top two in just one race this year -- the one - time @entity53 driver insisted he is fully focused on claiming another maximum 25 - point haul			1
" obviously there 's still a chance for @entity40 to win the title and for me not to win the title , " @entity1 told @entity3 's official website			1
" even if it 's only one point			2
" the moment you decide to fly , sooner or later there 's a moment when you will come down as well			0
you have to , nothing flies for ever			0
i think it would be wrong to think like that at this stage , the target going into this weekend is not to get one point , in a way it 's not to win the championship , the target is to do our best			0
" yes , there would be reason to celebrate , even if we finish tenth , but it would n't be the same so we try to race as usual and we try to get the best out of ourselves			0
" when asked what the secret behind his success was , @entity1 's answer was simple : " probably a word that is not at first sight that fancy , consistency			2
and in this respect we have had a terrific year so far and i hope it will not desert us for the final races			0
" the climax to the 2011 season is in stark contrast to last year 's finale , when @entity1 leaped from third position heading into the final race at the @entity97 to overhaul teammate @entity98 and @entity99 's two - time world champion @entity30 to claim glory			1
" going into the last race and being some points behind is a completely different situation to leading the standings by a gap of 124 points , " said @entity1 , who was 15 points adrift of first - place @entity30 heading into november 's final race in the gulf kingdom			1
" what i try to do is not to listen to all these statistics and simply focus on this race , as i always do with every single race -- which has served me well			0
i have learned from the mistakes that i made in the past and it would be foolish to make them again , so do n't wait to see them here			0
" it is not embarrassing making mistakes if you learn from them , but it would be embarrassing making the same mistakes all over again			0
" @entity40 signs new multi-year deal with @entity41 @entity40 was cautiously optimistic regarding his chances in @entity127 , but admitted the circuit is one which would suit @entity47 's @entity130 car			1
" i think it will be a great race for everyone , " said @entity40 , who recently signed a new deal with @entity132 - based @entity41			2
" in the last few races , i think we 've shown that we have extremely good pace and that we 've been the team most able to take the fight to @entity47			0
" on paper , i think it 's a circuit that will suit the @entity141 , particularly in the high - speed sweeps that make up the first sector of the track , but i certainly do n't think people should under - estimate our package			0
" we showed at @entity147 that we have a car that 's very effective in high - speed corners			0
we 've also improved our straight - line speed and we have a more efficient rear wing for qualifying , so i think we 're feeling positive about the weekend			0
" if @entity1 fails to clinch the championship this weekend , the title race would roll on to the @entity155 on october 16 .			2

@entity1 can clinch a second world title at sunday 's @entity9 @entity5
the @entity7 holds a 124 - point lead over @entity40 in the drivers ' standings
the @entity47 driver is poised to become the youngest double world champion in @entity3 history
