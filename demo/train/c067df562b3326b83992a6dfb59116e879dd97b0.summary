-- on monday , i wrote a story arguing that smartphones have the potential to make us " superhuman			1
" commenters on the article sure did n't like that phrasing			1
" smartphones also make us @entity12 , " wrote one commenter , @entity10			1
" just watch somebody with kids in the backseat as they text ' lol wut ' and run red lights			2
for all of the benefits of an always - connected society -- one where phones help people in rural areas get information they never had access to , or bring medical professionals , at least virtually , into difficult - to - reach locations -- there are plenty of drawbacks , too			1
as the commenters pointed out , these include physical dangers			1
" the next time a teenager almost kills you while they are texting little love letters while driving you better hope you are superhuman ! " wrote open400			1
in 2010 in the @entity44 , more than 3,000 people died in crashes that involved distracted driving , which includes sending texts and using the phone , according to the @entity44 @entity49			2
and more than one in 10 fatal crashes involving people younger than 20 were reported to be related to distracted driving			0
so , clearly , there is room for concern on this front			0
other commenters brought up the potential impact of smartphones on our brains			1
a 2011 @entity63 report found that radiation from mobile phones that are held up to a person 's ear can possibly increase the risk of cancer			1
the group placed these risks in the same category as those from lead , engine exhaust and chloroform			0
one possible solution : some cell phone users increasingly use their phones as everything but			1
" there are so many ways of keeping in constant touch with people that voice calls are almost too invasive now , " one woman told @entity0 last year			1
then there were complaints about what phones are doing to society			2
this was a big part of the online conversation			0
" smartphones have created a generation of narcissistic snobs who think they know everything , " wrote chemtrailed			1
" instead it 's created a bunch of @entity103 heads who would n't know how to blow their nose without ' googling ' how			2
" here 's another , from jimmy619 : " superhuman ? really ? i look around and see people getting fatter , dumber , poorer ( not to mention ruder ) in spite of all their gadgets			2
not my idea of superhuman			2
" and one more , from @entity115 : " one of the most disturbing things about cellphones , is that now people ca n't even sit at a stoplight without hitting the feeder bar that is their phone			0
in social situations , instead of striking up a conversation with a stranger , people now just delve into their phones			1
you can not tell me that is a good thing			0
" the persistent pull of smarpthone technology is a common complaint			0
some tech writers have addressed this by saying that smartphones , like all pieces of technology , are tools			2
they have to be controlled by the people who use them			0
but having all - the - time access to the internet on a mobile phone can be a bit overwhelming for some people			0
i 'll give the last word to perhaps the funniest comment of the bunch			0
" the author makes a very good point , " the commenter wrote ( my inner monologue : " wow , one person likes me ! " )			0
" before i owned an @entity152 , i was n't able to destroy a single structure built by evil pigs using only a slingshot and a few live birds			0
" ( me : " oh			0

*readers* react to a @entity0 story on the powers of smarpthones
instead of " superhuman , " one reader says phones make us " @entity12 "
commenters raise issues of *safety* , health and social impact
" smartphones have created a generation of narcissistic snobs "
