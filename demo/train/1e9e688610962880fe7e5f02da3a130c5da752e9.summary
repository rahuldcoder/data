-- nearly five years after the housing bubble burst , @entity3 homeowners are beginning to see signs of relief as housing markets are finally showing signs of recovery			1
an untold story of this recovery , however , is the extent to which it is fueled by immigration			1
a new analysis of @entity15 data by @entity16 and @entity17 shows that immigrants have collectively added $ 3.7 trillion to @entity3 housing wealth			1
and over the last several years , as many families in cities and rural areas from the @entity25 to @entity26 have seen their largest personal asset -- the home they live in -- placed in jeopardy , the inflow of immigrants has been a lifeline for them			0
the number of @entity3 - born @entity3 residing in @entity31 and surrounding @entity33 has declined by 900,000 since 1970			2
fortunately , the arrival of nearly 600,000 immigrants over the same time period has offset most of that decline -- and most likely kept additional natives from leaving -- blunting what could have been a catastrophe for the local housing market			1
similar stories exist all around the country			0
the @entity3 @entity15 data show that in @entity45 , @entity46 , which includes @entity47 , the influx of immigrants between 2000 and 2010 added more than $ 25,000 to the value of the average home			2
in @entity53 , @entity54 , which is home to staunch immigration opponent sheriff @entity55 , immigration added $ 18,000 to local home prices over the period			0
immigrants are a boon for the housing market in three ways			0
first , their demand for affordable housing renewed the local housing markets			1
this , coupled with increased demands for locally produced goods and services once they establish themselves , stimulates their neighborhood 's economy			2
second , and relatedly , as immigrants stimulate economic life in affordable neighborhoods , they attract more @entity3 - born people to those neighborhoods , further bolstering home values			1
for every 1,000 immigrants who move to a county , 250 @entity3 - born people eventually follow , drawn by the new economic opportunities that have been created			1
third , immigrants help stabilize neighborhoods that have gone into decline , helping these previously blighted neighborhoods become viable alternatives for middle - and working - class @entity3			1
importantly , because immigrants tend to gravitate to areas with cheaper housing costs , they create wealth in the housing market without contributing to the pricing out of the middle class from more desirable neighborhoods , especially in large metropolitan areas			2
immigrants and the housing market is just one chapter in the larger story of their role in helping our economy to grow			2
in health care , for example , the en masse retirement of @entity109 creates increased demand for professionals ranging from physicians and surgeons to home health aides			0
immigrants are critical for taking care of our elderly , and for filling the jobs needed to sustain our overall health care industry			0
the same holds true in housing			0
because immigrants move into areas where housing is cheaper and neighborhoods are more on the edge , they revitalize those neighborhoods			1
we 've seen that across @entity132 , from @entity133 in @entity134 to @entity135 and @entity136 in @entity137 to @entity138 in @entity139			0
encouraging the stability and growth of the @entity3 housing market is a fundamental aspect of ensuring a solid economy			1
so is ensuring @entity3 industries have access to a productive , diverse and flexible workforce with the right skills to grow and prosper			0
immigration is essential to achieving both of these goals and is thus essential to the future of the @entity3			2
with the future of immigration reform in the hands of the @entity156 , this new research gives added momentum for why we need a bipartisan agreement that reflects many of the basic compromises of the @entity162 bill			1
as a country we can not afford to refuse to modernize and reform our immigration system			0
turning away those who could help us build a stronger and more dynamic community and nation would be blind to our economic needs			0
now is the time for immigration reform			1
