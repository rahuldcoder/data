-- while the @entity2 ambles around the @entity4 countryside a dark shadow still lingers over the sport 's blue ribbon event			1
while the pr machine goes into overdrive and the wheels of change are supposedly set in motion , cycling 's attempt to lift the specter of @entity10 still remains			2
a man who ' won ' the @entity2 on seven occasions brought the sport to its knees last january after finally admitting he doped following years of denying the allegations			1
earlier this year , @entity10 revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone , as well as @entity24 -- a hormone which is naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production			2
his seven consecutive victories between 1999 - 2005 came amidst rumor and speculation that he was doping -- while the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) accused @entity10 of running " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen			1
" now , the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) , the sport 's governing body and its president @entity37 are under pressure to revamp cycling 's entire image			1
but its failure to catch @entity10 remains an albatross around its neck -- despite @entity37 vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame			1
" i 'll look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period , cheating and getting away with it because the system was n't strong enough to beat him , " @entity37 told @entity0 ahead of the start of the @entity2			1
" it was n't a question of authorities , because many authorities tried to catch him and were n't able to , so i do n't blame the @entity35			2
i do n't blame the @entity57 ( @entity4 anti-doping agency ) or @entity32 or anyone else			0
" the system was n't strong enough and they were using products that could n't be caught with the system			0
" the system is a lot stronger now and so i look back on an athlete and it 's not just @entity10 , many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it			2
" disillusioned however @entity37 's position as president of the @entity35 is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him			1
cycling @entity76 refused to back its home candidate for september 's @entity35 elections , while a recent management committee meeting in @entity80 , @entity81 , was a fiery affair			2
a dossier compiled by private investigators on @entity37 was reportedly put forward to the committee with the @entity86 blocking any attempts to discuss it on the opening day of the meeting			2
the document was eventually discussed and although its contents have not been made public , it represented another blow to @entity37 's re-election hopes			2
while @entity37 has denied all knowledge of @entity10 's activities , both he and the @entity35 have come in for criticism following the publication of a hugely detrimental report from the @entity32 last october			1
the report raised question marks over whether the @entity35 had a role in covering up positive tests -- an allegation which @entity37 strenuously denies			1
when pushed by @entity0 on whether the @entity35 covered up suspicious samples from @entity10 , @entity37 replied : " no. absolutely not			1
" after being quizzed on how he could be sure , @entity37 added : " because we know , we 've studied , we know what we 've done and we know , we have looked into all of this even since			2
" we have prepared , we have prepared a big number of files for the independent commission that we were going to present to the independent commission and all those questions that you 've asked there are all answered in those files			0
" i think he ( @entity10 ) was tested 10 - 15 times during the @entity2			1
so we did all we could do			0
those samples were sent away and they came back negative			0
" the @entity35 was n't the only anti-doping agency , so to speak , who was testing @entity10			1
" i mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation is n't strong enough and it was n't at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better			0
" but @entity37 is facing a challenge for the leadership from @entity129 cycling chief @entity128 , who has grown disillusioned with the @entity86 's tenure			0
it follows a catalog of perceived errors by the @entity35 , including the acceptance of a $ 100,000 donation from @entity10 in 2002 -- four years before @entity37 took up his role			1
the money was used by the @entity35 to buy a @entity139 machine , a contraption which is used to analyze blood samples			0
it is a decision which @entity37 concedes should not have been made			0
" i would say and we have said , we have admitted that in hindsight -- and of course hindsight is an exact science -- that it would have been better had we not accepted those , " he said			0
" but we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to			0
" @entity128 has been heavily critical of the way @entity37 has led the @entity35 and has pledged to restore faith in the organization			1
he has promised to create a completely new independent anti-doping unit , which would work alongside the @entity156 ( @entity156 )			0
cheats @entity37 , who is aiming to secure a third term in office , remains philosophical about the future and the battle against doping			2
" nobody is silly enough to say that you 're 100 % confident that the peleton is 100 % clean , " added the @entity35 president			1
" that 's just not possible			0
it 's not going to be possible in any sport or in any parts of society , but certainly i think the large majority of cyclists are now going into their careers , not wanting to get involved in doping			0
" and there 's evidence of many riders who come from strong teams , with strong anti-doping backgrounds all winning races and when they get across , you know , when they 're doing their press conferences , they are saying i 'm an example of how you can win a race clean " i do n't think it 'll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats			0
" there are people who look for a short - cut , who try to win by devious means or whatever			0
" whether it 's cheating by taking drugs or cheating in any other fashion , there are always going to be people like that in society and in sport			0
" there is one avenue which remains open to @entity37 though -- a route which involves @entity10			1
the opportunity to talk to the disgraced cyclist in a bid to improve doping control remains a possibility -- and @entity37 is refusing to rule out such a move			1
" he certainly has more knowledge , " he said of @entity10			0
" if he was prepared , in terms of coming to the @entity35 , not necessarily to me and explain in more detail or give us more assistance , give us more information and try to help us in planning the future on the fight against doping , we 'd certainly be interested in speaking to him			1
