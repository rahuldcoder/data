-- on a man - made island in the @entity5 , the world 's newest super mall sits empty -- for now			1
inside , water fountains shoot into the air , giant plasma screens flash advertisements , escalators rise and fall ; their only admirers are the odd construction worker			2
missing from this scene are the shoppers			2
but come november , @entity17 's 235,000 square meter @entity15 plans to open its doors to 20 million visitors per year			1
" it 's a conservative estimate , " says @entity20 , ceo of @entity21 , the developers behind the ambitious design			1
think big with over 400 stores , @entity15 will be the second largest shopping complex in the @entity27 , developers hoping it will emulate the success of neighboring @entity31 -- double the size at 502,000 square meters			1
" over the last five years , the growth of both @entity31 and the @entity35 has been immense , " explained @entity33			0
" they 've both become destinations in themselves			0
" @entity17 does not have that sort of destination here , it does not have that visitor experience			2
it needs that , it 's hungry for it , and @entity15 is hopefully going to cater to that hunger			1
" island living the plush shopping center is the latest addition to @entity49 , a purpose - built $ 40 billion holiday destination rising off the coast of @entity17			1
opened in 2009 , the island boasts a @entity54 circuit , water park , and " @entity58 " with the fastest roller coaster on the planet			1
if shoppers are as " hungry , " as @entity33 says , then @entity17 is working hard to feed them			1
last year the city was ranked 18th in the world in terms of new retail space			0
and before consumers have even stepped inside @entity15 , @entity33 is already talking expansion			1
" we could n't fit all the retailers we wanted to be here , so we 're already starting to plan phase two , " he said			0
" @entity17 is a growing city			2
it 's growing in its developments , it 's growing in its demographics			0
and we are catering our retail for each aspect			0
" smooth sailing ? this phenomenal growth has n't been without losses			0
@entity78 was 13.7billion dirhams ( @entity79 $ 3.7 billion ) in debt last year , later merging with rival @entity81			1
" we continue to manage our debt to the best of our abilities , and we continue to be a development company , " said @entity33			0
" over the last year we 've launched two major projects that had been completely sold out			0
but we have developed in a mature , professional manner			0
" as the finishing touches are made at @entity15 , we 'll soon find out if the island 's latest addition sinks or swims			2
property : @entity5 hot spots not where you think travel : ' @entity97 ' of tourists head to @entity99 style : @entity102 fashion to rival @entity103 ?			0
