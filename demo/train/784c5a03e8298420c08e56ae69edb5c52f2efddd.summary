-- this week , champions of the " open net " are decrying a @entity4 decision striking down an @entity6 ruling that required internet service providers to be neutral in their restrictions on bandwidth			1
the idea here is that giant bandwidth users , like @entity14 or @entity15 , will be required to pay access providers , like @entity17 or @entity18 , for all that video they 're streaming to the likes of us			1
maybe they 'd even be able to buy themselves a special faster lane on the internet for their traffic			0
of course , " open web " advocates see in the court decision @entity32 of a free and egalitarian @entity26			2
by striking down the provisions of what the industry calls " net neutrality , " the court has also struck down an internet provider 's obligation to let all content through its servers			2
in theory , they can now legally pick and choose whose media makes it to its subscribers			0
but this whole issue , and the instantaneous outcry associated with every move by a court or agency , is more complex than it looks on the surface			0
by casting this issue in such stark terms , those who would defend internet freedom from the evil corporations may just be playing into the hands of other corporations whose designs on the @entity26 are no better			0
in fact it seems like just yesterday when nearly all the @entity26 's champions were telling government to stay away from the net			0
the @entity66 was home to the revival of @entity69 and a new spirit of techno - utopian libertarianism			1
the idea was : the free market will cure any glitches along the way , as technology firms simply compete to bring us the best			0
the 1997 @entity79 cover story , " the @entity80 , " argued that the only impediment to technology - fueled economic growth would be the regulation of the marketplace			0
" open good , closed bad			0
tattoo it on your forehead			0
" this became a credo of @entity91 and the net in general			0
people acted as if the internet just emerged out of culture , like a technological extension of the collective human nervous system , rather than a network that was meticulously planned and built by government and , yes , @entity101			0
instead the main metaphor for the net would be the @entity104 , out of the reach of government meddling			1
but as anyone who has studied the @entity104 ( or even watched " @entity109 " ) has learned , gold rushes get messy at the end			1
eventually a big , corrupt gold mining company starts exploiting all that lawlessness , and all of a sudden it 's the formerly independent law - haters turning to the sheriff for help			0
and so the defenders of the net now go running for assistance to an @entity6 that has been systematically excluded at every turn and diminished in its power by some of these very same parties			1
slammed down as if it were burning books whenever it considers protecting kids from pornography or interfering in some affair that is being fought out in the marketplace , the @entity6 has become a derided and timid agency			1
that 's why the @entity6 was destined to lose this case			1
it never even defined the internet as a " common carrier " -- like a road or telegraph wire -- which would necessarily be regulated in a neutral fashion , permitting passage by all			0
yet in its ruling this week , the court even made it clear that the @entity6 has the ability to define the net as it chooses -- opening the door for the agency to claim the internet as its domain and enforce net neutrality			1
no doubt , @entity148 ( which owns @entity15 ) , and @entity14 will be encouraging all free citizens of the @entity26 to push the @entity6 in this direction			1
after all , they 're the ones whose videos make up a majority of internet traffic , and who would be forced to pay the tolls -- that is , until they passed them down to us , which would likely lose them some business			1
in such an environment , an " open " web really just means open to corporations , who maintain their monopoly on bandwidth by technological superiority			2
none of us will have the streaming capability of a @entity148 or @entity14 off our home servers -- unless , of course , the @entity6 regulates things that way			2
i , for one , would less like to see net neutrality than net favoritism : it 's the transmissions between real people , schools , artists and nonprofit organizations that need a special lane on the net if anyone 's going to get such a provision			1
so before we start shouting about what government and corporations should do to make the @entity66 " open , " we 'd better remember that one person 's " open " may as well be another person 's " closed			1
" if we want a better , freer net , we have to stop responding so impulsively to every action taken in one direction or another -- particularly when there are multibillion - dollar corporations paying handsomely to make us think they 're on our side			2
we have to remember instead who we did hire to protect our interests			0
yes , it 's time to go get the sheriff ( in this case the @entity6 ) , apologize for having stamped on his badge , and tell him he has the authority to regulate this space			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

court strikes down rule that @entity215 ca **n't** favor some *websites* over others
@entity211 : corporations may have to pay for more bandwidth to stream videos
he says @entity6 should be *empowered* to make rules to favor real people , nonprofits
@entity211 : the idea of letting @entity66 be a lawless @entity104 does **n't** work
