@entity0 -- wearing a purple polo and stylish @entity5 sunglasses , @entity2 strolled into the interview room calm , confident , and defiant			1
" what do i see in the coming days ? that the revolution will succeed and that the legitimate leader will return , " he said			0
" the @entity12 people will never again be scared or petrified of a tank or terrorized by detention			2
" a little more than a week ago , @entity2 's father , former president @entity15 , was forcibly ousted by the @entity12 military and swiftly replaced with a civilian transitional government			1
" this is a coup of the revolution , a coup on democracy , a coup on the constitution and the will of the people			1
the defense minister is essentially saying to the millions that voted in presidential elections and on the constitutional referendum , ' you do n't know what is best for you			2
i know what is best for you '			0
" despite the younger @entity2 's outrage at his father 's ouster , the new government is continuing to fill posts			1
interim prime minister @entity38 said that 70 % of the choices for ministers and ministerial posts have been completed , according to the state - run @entity43 news agency			1
the final formation of the government is expected to be announced monday , according to @entity43			0
experts predict @entity12 's future for the millions of @entity12 who packed the streets in a nationwide revolt on june 30 and screamed " leave ! " at @entity15 , the word " coup " is an insult , a dirty term that denigrates what they believe is revolution redux , but @entity2 vehemently disagrees			1
" june 30 was not a revolution ! and history will never record it as a revolution			0
and no one , not the @entity65 administration or anyone else , can call it a revolution			0
why ? because there is no revolution in the world that brings military rule			0
there is no revolution in the word that cancels the ballot box			0
" that sentiment was echoed by @entity79 prime minister @entity78 thursday at a dinner in @entity81 , according to @entity79 's semi-official news outlet @entity82			1
" every military coup , regardless of its target , country and reason , is the murderer of the democracy , people and the future of the country , " @entity78 said , adding that protests in @entity85 did not legalize the coup			1
with a 48 - hour deadline imposed by the military looming , @entity15 spoke to his son for the last time before addressing the country on state television on july 2			1
" i asked him on a personal level , as a son , for him to remain defiant and move forward and not retreat in the face of the armed forces , " he said			1
" the @entity15 that i know is a point of pride as a son , so the @entity15 that would back down or flee would be shameful to me , even if he stayed president			1
" former president @entity2 is currently being held in an undisclosed location for his " personal safety , " @entity12 armed forces spokesman col. @entity113 told @entity1 , but for a son missing his father , these reassurances are meaningless			1
" do n't worry about his personal safety			0
no one , not the defense ministry or interior ministry , should worry about his personal safety , " @entity2 said sarcastically			1
" if the situation is to hold him in this immoral and illegal detention , then he must be released ! and if it is a legal detention , then i welcome that , and let us follow the law			0
" reporter notebook : @entity2 a victim of @entity12 's revolution the green - eyed father of two had refused to speak in his broken @entity132 until the moment he was asked whether he tried to contact his father in custody			1
" i am a part of the revolution and i am stronger than asking one of ( the military ) , ' please let me speak to my dad			2
' no ! we are in a revolution			0
a new wave of the january 25 revolution ... our democracy path , we will not let it go			1
" the january 25 revolution of 2011 led to the ouster of longtime president @entity147			2
hundreds of @entity149 supporters remain in detention , and the public prosecutor has issued dozens of arrest warrants for top leadership , but the younger @entity2 chose to meet in broad daylight at one of the most recognizable mosques in @entity0			2
" the revolution will succeed			0
the revolution that ended the @entity147 regime will continue strong			0
we know no other way than success , " @entity2 continued			2
" this is a peaceful revolution against a bloody coup , but this revolution will be even more important than january 25 because it will strike at the root			2

" more than two years after a popular uprising toppled former president @entity147 's 30 - year dictatorship , @entity12 's various political factions struggle for the ownership of their beloved " thawra , " or revolution , a faceless and leaderless movement both the @entity149 and its organized opposition seek to co-opt			0
" we elected ( @entity2 ) and succeeded him so he can confront challenges by the principles of the revolution , the concepts of a democratic transition , with sound democracy , and in this transition , individuals are not as important as the will of the masses			1
" over and over again , the 30 - year - old judge repeated the well - being of his father is secondary to the principles of democracy and the demands of thousands of @entity197 supporters staging a sit - in just outside the window			2
on thursday , @entity2 supporters continued their sit - in at @entity203 and has planned to break their @entity204 fast there , @entity200 reported			2
" @entity15 , even though he is the president and even though he is elected and the legitimate leader , and despite his international standing and his role in the revolution , n he is not more important than the people killed at the @entity213 , " @entity2 said , referring to the deaths of 51 people in clashes earlier this week			1
