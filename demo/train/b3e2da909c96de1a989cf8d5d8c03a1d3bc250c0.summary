@entity0 , @entity1 -- in my nine years as a @entity5 ambassador , i 've been to camps for people displaced by conflict			1
though hardly luxurious , they usually have some kind of structure : a water source , latrines , even schools			1
in @entity1 , even the most basic services are hard to come by as the small country staggers from the flow of refugees from its larger neighbor			1
the places i saw had no toilets , no clean water sources , no places to shower and no areas for cooking			1
cases of painful scabies , lice and fleas are on the rise			0
i met mothers and children who have witnessed unspeakable acts of violence , including the death of loved ones			2
often arriving in @entity1 with no more than the clothes on their backs , moms are trying to hold their families together with no idea how they will feed , clothe or shelter their traumatized kids			1
many of these refugees lived a middle - class life in @entity45 , where they had homes , jobs , electricity and plumbing			1
visit @entity5 's website to find out how you can help now , their savings have dwindled and many of them are dependent on the generosity and hospitality of strangers			1
they are living in tents constructed from discarded objects such as burlap sacks and plastic sheets			0
they might rent land from a farmer or squat in an abandoned construction site			0
these new " homes " leave them exposed to all sorts of dangers , respiratory infections and other diseases			0
and because there are no official camps , people are scattered , which makes identifying the informal settlement sites extremely challenging			0
we traveled to a cement factory , where some @entity45 mothers were renting tiny rooms to house their entire families			1
i noticed one young girl who had dull , patchy skin			0
her eyes sparkled and she was quick to smile , but her hair , eyebrows and lashes were sparse			0
when i asked about what happened , i was told that she became ill after playing in the factory 's toxic waste			0
since january , the number of @entity45 refugees in @entity1 has increased nearly six-fold			1
more than a million people are in urgent need of humanitarian aid			2
considering @entity1 has a population of 4 million people , this is a crisis of epic scale that is putting enormous strain on local communities			1
according to @entity5 , there are more than 270,000 refugee children who are not in school in the country ; by the end of the year , the number could exceed 400,000			1
some of them have missed out on more than a year of learning			0
@entity45 children can enroll in public schools in @entity1 as long as there is space , but many schools are already at capacity			1
in the @entity119 , much of the discussion about @entity45 has been focused on politics			2
but for the kids i met , and millions more like them all across the region , politics is the farthest thing from their minds			0
despite bearing no responsibility for the violence , children are paying the heaviest price for the conflict			2
they desperately need water , medical attention , sanitation , psychological support and the opportunity to receive an education , but there are simply not enough resources to alleviate suffering			2
in spite of the enormity of the crisis , funding for lifesaving aid is in short supply			0
@entity5 still needs $ 172 million this year to assist @entity45 refugees across the region , which means programs to support these children are threatened			1
clean water , schools , health care and nutrition are all at risk			1
i was overwhelmed by the deprivation and trauma the children we met have endured			2
but they rushed up to us with kisses and hugs , asking only for the chance to go to school			0
what 's at stake is an entire generation of children who are carrying the emotional and physical scars of war			0
@entity172 is running out for them			0
they need our help to stay alive , to go to school and to be kids again			0
frustration in @entity179 with aid to @entity45 rebels			2

@entity5 ambassador @entity183 visited @entity45 refugees in @entity1
each *day* thousands of @entity45 flee into the country , half are children
@entity5 needs $ 172 million to provide clean water , schools , health care and nutrition
