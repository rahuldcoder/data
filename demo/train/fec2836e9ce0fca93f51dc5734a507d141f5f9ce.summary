-- former @entity2 referees have jumped to the defense of @entity4 after criticism of his performance in sunday 's @entity8 final			1
@entity4 , the first referee to officiate the @entity10 final and @entity8 final in the same season , dished out 13 yellow cards and one red as @entity15 defeated the @entity16 1 - 0 in a tempestuous clash at @entity18 , @entity19			1
@entity21 coach @entity20 and several of his players suggested the @entity24 official favored the @entity25 , and @entity16 fans booed @entity4 and his assistants when they collected their medals after the game			1
but ex-referee @entity30 , who took charge of several fiery encounters between @entity24 giants like @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , was full of praise for @entity4 's performance in extremely testing circumstances			1
" i thought he had a superb game , " @entity30 told @entity0			0
" i find it very difficult to remember a more testing game than that at any level			0
i thought the players ' behavior and discipline were abysmal			0
" it was as if the @entity21 had decided the only way they were going to stop @entity15 was by kicking them , harassing the referee and being obnoxious throughout			0
" from a referee 's point of view , if the players do n't want to be controlled it 's virtually impossible to control them			0
had it had been a referee without his experience of the @entity61 game , they might have lost control within the first 30 minutes			0
" @entity4 's tally of 14 yellow cards -- including the red shown to @entity16 defender @entity66 in extra-time - was a record for the @entity8 final			1
players from both sides flew into challenges from the first whistle and @entity21 midfielder @entity73 was fortunate to escape with only a yellow for a chest - high kick on @entity15 's @entity76			2
" @entity4 will never , ever , if he lives to be 100 , referee a tougher match , " @entity77 , another former @entity2 referee , told @entity78			0
" if you take the @entity73 tackle out -- i thought that was a red card -- other than that i do n't think he 's got much to really look back in anger at himself , because he 's gone out , he 's been tested to the absolute limit			0
" @entity88 president @entity87 also defended @entity4 's performance , stating that it was " not easy " to control such a match			1
" it 's not up to me to judge the performances of the officials , i can only say it was a very hard task that the referee trio had on the field of play , " he told reporters in @entity19			2
the defeat was the @entity16 ' third in a @entity8 final , and several of the players made @entity4 the target of their frustration			1
the official declined to dismiss @entity15 center - back @entity106 for a tug on @entity109 as he bore down on goal in the second half and failed to award a corner to the @entity21 when a free - kick was deflected wide shortly before @entity15 's goal			2
" there were some strange decisions and for me , honestly , if you play a @entity8 final , you need a world - class referee , " @entity109 said , the @entity115 reported			2
@entity20 said @entity4 had not controlled the match , while @entity36 forward @entity122 said : " i know you can not blame others , but the referee favored @entity15			1
" @entity30 , @entity4 's room - mate when he joined the @entity2 circuit in 2003 , has no sympathy for the @entity21			1
" to listen to @entity21 players after the game blaming the referee for the defeat after they conducted themselves abysmally for the whole two hours is unbelievable , " he said			0
" i hope when they look back at what they 've said they are totally and utterly embarrassed			0
