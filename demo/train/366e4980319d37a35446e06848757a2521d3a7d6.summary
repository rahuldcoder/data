-- at his official post-election press conference , president @entity1 told reporters that he 's serious about fighting climate change while creating jobs			0
" we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs , advance growth and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader , " he said , " i think that 's something that the @entity14 people would support			1
" we have just the answer			0
it 's not a new idea , but as the two parties face off over the federal budget , it could be the path forward			0
there 's a tool we can use to answer the public 's call for more jobs -- without cuts to @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 : a carbon tax			1
one analysis by the @entity32 says a moderate , $ 20 - per - ton tax on carbon emissions could raise $ 1.25 trillion over 10 years			1
and the savings do n't stop there			0
for decades , the oil and coal industries have passed along their costs to the rest of us , in the form of asthma treatment , emergency room visits , doctor bills and missed days of school and work			0
combined with droughts , wildfires , hurricanes and severe weather events like @entity52 , rising levels of carbon in the atmosphere cost our nation an estimated $ 70 billion each year			1
and unlike cutting @entity27 and @entity29 , a carbon tax is a political winner			1
a large and growing super-majority of @entity14 -- 70 % -- believe climate change is a real problem			2
a @entity65 national survey found overwhelming majorities in favor of bold action like a carbon tax			1
even the far - right @entity70 has been willing to talk about the benefits of a carbon tax , and anti-tax activist @entity73 has flirted with the idea			1
yes , polluters will fight a carbon tax tooth and nail , just like tobacco companies raged against cigarette taxes			2
but far from costing jobs , a carbon tax will provide a net benefit to our economy , especially if we start the carbon tax conversation by making sure miners and other coal industry workers -- the people who have sacrificed their lungs , and in some instances even their lives , so that we can keep the lights on -- are among the biggest winners			1
experts anticipate that the $ 500 billion in scheduled federal budget cuts will cost us nearly one million jobs			1
the $ 1.25 trillion from a carbon tax would allow us to avoid these cuts with money to spare to pay down the deficit , and to maintain clean energy investments that create 3.2 times as many jobs per dollar than subsidies for fossil fuels			1
a carbon tax would also reduce barriers to market entry for clean - energy startups facing an entrenched fossil fuel industry			2
there are already 3.1 million green jobs in @entity14 -- imagine how many more there would be if we leveled the playing field instead of subsidizing oil and coal companies			2
finally , one study by the @entity118 and the @entity119 found that we could create up to 1.7 million jobs simply by putting a price on carbon			1
the fact is , our economy will only be stronger and our communities healthier if we tax pollution instead of subsidizing it -- and invest in the new industries of tomorrow			0
a carbon tax is really that rarest of ideas , a win - win - win solution that solves multiple problems at once			2
tax polluters so we can pay down our debt without slashing the safety net ? win			0
spur investment in new technologies and spark the creation of clean - energy manufacturing jobs right here in @entity14 ? win			2
and take a long - overdue step toward solving the climate crisis that already costs so much , and will only get worse ? win			0
the question is n't whether this vision is right for @entity14 -- nearly everyone wants to breathe fresh air , drink clean water , bring home a decent paycheck and retire with security			0
the only question is if @entity152 has the courage to seize this opportunity			0
if they do , this moment wo n't be remembered as a drawn - out partisan showdown over spending , but as the launching pad from which we began to sail into a healthier , more prosperous future			0
