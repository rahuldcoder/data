critics of the cease - fire reached wednesday between @entity2 and @entity3 argue that little has changed			1
for now , they say , the @entity5 - brokered de-escalation has merely placed a @entity6 over a seeping wound , restoring the status quo established after @entity3 's @entity10 offensive of late 2008			2
certainly , we may well see the return of airstrikes and rockets ; the truce represents only a small first step toward a more durable solution			0
the nature of the agreement , however , points to a clear " @entity21 truth " and a significant shift in regional dynamics : the international isolation of @entity2 has ended			0
the influence exercised by @entity5 , @entity26 and @entity27 was clearly instrumental in delivering this cease - fire			1
the role of @entity5 president @entity30 , in particular , has been praised by @entity2 political leader @entity31 and @entity33 secretary of state @entity32 alike , with the latter commending @entity5 's government for " assuming responsibility and leadership " in de-escalating the crisis			1
toward the end of 2011 , @entity2 ' departure from @entity40 was sealed when @entity31 refused to denounce the uprising against his former host and sponsor , @entity46 president @entity45			2
with its regional base and @entity49 funding in jeopardy , @entity2 has increasingly turned to its fellow @entity52 allies in @entity5 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
the degree of influence that this troika of @entity21 playmakers has over @entity2 ' leaders , however , was revealed only by the recent crisis			2
the absence in negotiations of the @entity61 and its president , @entity62 , was telling			0
it shows that in a post-revolution @entity65 , engagement with @entity2 on its own is both feasible and tempting			1
opinion : how to prevent the next clash with @entity2 in this respect , however , the @entity5 president missed the opportunity to get @entity62 and @entity31 working together and further stalled efforts at @entity61 unity			1
that is the demand of the overwhelming majority of @entity75			0
to be sure , @entity49 still has an important role to play with @entity2			0
alongside @entity5 -- and , remarkably , the @entity33 -- @entity31 recognized on wednesday the importance of @entity49 's contribution to his movement 's efforts ( in the field of resistance , rather than resolution )			2
he praised @entity85 for providing the group with arms and financial support , despite " differences between @entity49 and @entity2 on issues connected with the conflict in @entity46			0
" in this respect , however , he is walking a fine line with his regional backers in order to keep his regional options open			0
it is worth remembering that @entity2 is not a monolithic entity			0
some within the movement are more focused on resistance , while others are focused on governance , reconciling with @entity103 and reining in independent @entity105 - based militants			0
this is something i heard privately in january 2011 in @entity105 and subsequently when talking to some of @entity2 ' senior political officials			2
the international community -- and @entity3 -- should work with the newly emerged regional troika of @entity5 - @entity26 - @entity27 to engage with @entity2 and strengthen @entity2 's pragmatic wing			1
given the strength of its ties , though , @entity49 could still prove to be a spoiling influence			0
this initiative , as specified by @entity116 , should focus on steps toward " a just and lasting peace			0
" let us hope that the past week or so has renewed the @entity123 administration 's drive to achieve @entity3 - @entity61 peace			1
in the short term , this means pushing for @entity61 unity around a negotiating position and ending the blockade on @entity105 , both of which the @entity27 emir stressed in his landmark trip to @entity105 last month			1
the continuation of this blockade helps no one , and the destitution it imposes on @entity139 has only further radicalized much of the largely young population			0
about 80 % of @entity105 's households live on less than $ 2 a day , while 1.3 million or 80 % of its citizens receive some form of food aid			1
no wonder the @entity146 recently declared that under current circumstances , the strip would be unlivable by 2020 , citing shortages of food , water electricity , jobs , hospital beds and classrooms			0
opinion : @entity3 , engage @entity62 now if such conditions continue , @entity2 may well resort to further rocket attacks against @entity3 's southern communities or turn a blind eye to other groups launching such terror attacks			0
groups such as @entity163 , the @entity164 and the small but growing number of @entity167 groups that have agreed to the cease - fire will pose a challenge to @entity2 ' authority , especially if there is no progress on the ground			1
these international efforts begin with the implementation of the admittedly shaky cease - fire			1
@entity5 has emphasized the importance of effectively ending the blockade on @entity105 -- one of the conditions of the cease - fire document			1
in the @entity183 border arrangement , @entity3 retained significant veto powers over the passage of people and the flow of goods through @entity5 's border crossings with @entity105			2
the new @entity5 , however , has stressed the importance of formalizing the free flow of goods into and out of @entity105			2
in doing so , it wants to diminish the role of the " informal " tunnel economy , which , while generating large amounts of revenue for @entity2 , has helped create an unstable situation in the @entity199 badlands			0
if @entity3 now fails to deliver on its responsibilities regarding the conditions of the cease - fire , it risks not only a return to conflict but also losing the good will of @entity30 .			1

in post-revolution @entity65 , engagement with @entity2 is feasible , @entity207 says
influence of @entity5 , @entity26 and @entity27 was instrumental in delivering cease - fire , he says
maintaining @entity105 blockade only serves to further radicalize @entity105 's population , he says
@entity123 administration should push for @entity61 unity and end to blockade , he says
