a man is leaning out of the sunroof of a car driving down a six - lane freeway , holding a massive @entity12 flag in one hand and , in the other , a portrait of @entity15			1
" the islands are ours , " he yells , referring to @entity12 's claim on what it calls the @entity19 islands			1
he denounces @entity21 , and others in the car raised clenched fists , threatening to go to war			1
protests have flared for another day across the country			0
this is not just any day , it is the anniversary of the incident that set off the @entity21 invasion of @entity12 in 1931			1
the wounds of history run deep amongst generations raised on stories of the brutality of @entity21 occupation			1
the row over the islands is tearing at those old scars			0

the islands dispute is a magnet for a grab bag of competing agendas			0
@entity21 plants close amid @entity12 fury the open displays of @entity44 fury , say some @entity12 watchers , is a convenient distraction for the @entity60 as it grapples with a fraught leadership transition marked by political scandal , murder , " disappearances " and infighting			1

@entity21 says @entity12 ceded sovereignty when it lost the @entity105 in 1895			1
