@entity0 , @entity1 -- scrupulously silent in public but colorfully candid in person , the former head of @entity1 's spy agency did n't hold back in a meeting with a senior @entity9 official in july 2008			1
it was a meeting that he had assumed would stay private and the content classified			0
according to the cable marked " secret , " but now part of the @entity17 document dump , @entity14 admits his spy agency , the @entity18 , or @entity18 , was " increasingly distracted from its mission by legal challenges that could endanger foreign intelligence - sharing with @entity1 agencies			1
" according to the cable , he complains about @entity1 having an " @entity25 ' world view and goes on to describe @entity1 courts " whose judges have tied @entity18 ' in knots , ' making it ever more difficult to detect and prevent terror attacks in @entity1 and abroad			1
" " the situation , he commented , left government security agencies on the defensive and losing public support for their effort to protect @entity1 and its allies , " the @entity33 cable says			0
a @entity1 court had earlier that year agreed to release a videotaped interrogation of @entity45 detainee @entity44 , who recently pleaded guilty to murder in a special military hearing at @entity45			0
of the video release , the cable states that @entity14 told the @entity9 that " a videotaped recording of a tearful @entity44 at the military prison at @entity52 would trigger " knee - jerk anti-americanism " and " paroxysms of moral outrage , a @entity1 specialty			2
" @entity14 is now retired			0
the formerly secret @entity17 cable has sent @entity1 into damage control			0
@entity1 foreign affairs minister @entity59 said at a press conference monday that " these leaked documents that pertain to @entity1 are in my view ... not something that will harm our relations			1
i do find it deplorable , though , that documents are leaked in this fashion " @entity33 secretary of state @entity69 contacted @entity59 over the weekend to brief him on the @entity1 disclosures in the @entity17 documents			2
@entity17 says it has more than 2,000 documents that pertain to @entity1 , most of which have not yet been released			0
intriguingly , this cable from july 2008 refers to @entity1 's spy agency agreeing to open a channel to @entity78 's intelligence service , but added that it was something @entity14 has not yet " figured out			1
" also in the cable is a reference to @entity14 saying his spy agency " responded to recent , non-specific intelligence on possible terror operations by ' vigorously harassing ' known @entity85 members in @entity1			2

@entity14 : @entity1 have an " @entity25 ' world view
