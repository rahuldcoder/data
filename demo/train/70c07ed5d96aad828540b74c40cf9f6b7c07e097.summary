-- from the continuing rise of tablet devices to the daily - deals craze and the return of the internet ipo , 2011 has been a transformative year for technology			1
the pace of change has become blisteringly fast , with traditional industries -- bookstores , video - rental chains , newspapers -- crumbling more quickly than we could have imagined			2
predicting what will happen in 2012 , therefore , is a shot in the dark : a year is virtually a lifetime in the digital era			1
and yet we can at least make a guess at what will happen in the early part of next year simply by looking at the trends that are shaping the latter half of this year			1
here 's my best estimate of some of the innovation we 'll see in 2012 : 1			1
touch computing new input methods will be the dominant trend of 2012			2
tablet computers such as the @entity33 might seem like a nice alternative to desktop and laptop computers , but i believe they 're more than that : they 're replacements			0
just as the command line ( remember that ? ) gave way to graphical user interfaces , so the mouse will be superseded by touchscreens			0
the signs are obvious : @entity46 and @entity47 , the latest desktop operating systems , borrow heavy from their mobile counterparts			0
these new interfaces essentially impose a touchscreen - inspired interface over the traditional desktop environment			2
over time , this half - step will become a whole one , and mobile operating systems will dominate			2
the transition wo n't be complete by the end of 2012 , but we 'll be much further down the path , and using computer mice much less often			1
@entity64 gestures in the social media realm , social gestures appear to be the leading trend of 2012			1
launched by @entity69 in september , this so - called " frictionless sharing " functionality removes the need to click a button to share media with your friends			1
instead , everything you listen to , read or watch is automatically posted to your profile once you approve the relevant app. if you 've seen apps such as @entity80 or @entity81 in your @entity69 news feed , you 're already aware of these features			1
the trend makes sense for social networks : with 800 million people already on @entity69 , its growth is bound to slow			1
but if sharing becomes automatic , the volume of content on @entity69 will grow at an accelerated pace			1
there 's a big problem , however : users may be " creeped out " by all this automated sharing of their web activity and grow suspicious of the apps using it			1
@entity101 and mobile payments next year is likely to be the year when mobile payments blossom			2
while we 've seen a great deal of innovation in mobile payments technology this year -- including the success of @entity111 's @entity110 dongle , allowing anyone to accept credit card payments -- 2012 is the year of @entity101			1
what 's that , you ask ? @entity101 essentially lets you replace your credit cards with your phone : wave an @entity101 - enabled phone near the credit card reader in a store ( or taxi cab ) , and the money is deducted from your account			1
by 2013 , 1 in 5 cellphones are expected to be @entity101 - equipped			2
early contenders include @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 ( by @entity130 ) and @entity131			0
beyond the @entity33 if touch computing is the future , then the @entity33 is surely king			0
and yet the @entity33 came up against serious competition in the latter part of 2011 : as i wrote previously , i expect the new @entity138 to outsell the @entity33 in 2012			2
why ? simply put , the @entity33 costs $ 499 while the @entity139 costs $ 199			0
@entity141 's advantages do n't stop at the price point , however : the company owns an entire content store of movies , e-books , tv shows and other media			2
with tablet devices , the hardware is somewhat important but the content available for the device is absolutely critical : with plenty of media available for the @entity139 right away , it 's an appealing proposition			0
why does one device constitute an entire trend ? well , as a true competitor to the @entity33 emerges , content producers , distributors and even app developers may have an entirely new platform on which to push their wares			0
( and yes , the @entity138 does indeed run @entity166 's @entity165 operating system , but @entity141 's version is so unlike other @entity165 tablets that neither users nor app developers will perceive it as " yet another @entity165 device " -- it 's a whole new platform			2
tv everywhere so you thought you 'd be able to watch all your favorite shows online and get rid of your cable subscription for good ? not so fast ! the cable companies have a cunning plan : they 'll let you watch live tv , plus on - demand movies and tv shows , on your connected devices if you keep your cable subscription			1
@entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 are among those offering the service			0
tv everywhere has been buzzed about since 2010 , of course , and could be a dud -- but the rise of tablet devices would seem to create increased demand for a " tv in your hands			2
voice control here 's another trend that 's got a moderate chance of taking off in 2012 : voice control			1
the novelty of @entity203 on the @entity204 -- which allows you to send texts , create reminders , search the @entity208 and much more using just your voice -- may be the start of a new trend in voice controlled devices			1
surely voice control has been around for years ? yes , but it was n't very accurate			1
@entity203 and its ilk define a new era in which we talk , and our devices understand -- often on the first attempt			1
other device makers will likely follow suit			0
what 's more , @entity224 may use voice control to replace the tv remote			1
spatial gestures other input methods are gaining traction too : @entity233 's @entity232 , for instance , has given rise to interfaces that use spatial gestures			0
just like in " minority report , " your devices can be controlled simply by waving your hands in the air			0
thanks to the many innovators who have hacked @entity232 to work with other platforms , we may see more devices using this input method next year			0
second - screen experiences " second - screen experiences " is a buzz - phase among tv and movie execs these days			2
it refers to apps ( mainly on the @entity33 ) that listen to the audio output of your tv and display content related to the show or movie you 're watching			0
the chances are that you already use your tablet computer or phone while watching tv , so there 's ample opportunity to make the viewing experience a more interactive one			0
@entity269 already has second - screen apps for movies such as " @entity272 " and " @entity273 , " while multiple tv networks have similar offerings : we can expect many , many more to be released in 2012			1
flexible screens personally , i just ca n't wait for flexible screens : these awesome new bendable interfaces will let you zoom in , zoom out and scroll around a page simply by twisting your phone or tablet			0
@entity285 and @entity286 have both hinted they may release phones with bendable displays in 2012			1
the really exciting stuff , however -- like paper - thin devices that roll up to fit in your pocket -- is still years away			0
@entity293 can i squeeze in one more trend ? it 's @entity293 -- the fifth iteration of the @entity293 standard -- and it lets developers create richer , more interactive applications than ever			0
why does this matter ? as developers tire of building applications for every operating system out there -- from @entity165 to @entity306 to @entity307 and beyond -- @entity293 offers the opportunity to build an app once and have it work everywhere			0
the rise of @entity293 is bound to be accelerated by a recent revelation : @entity313 is killing off @entity314 for mobile devices , meaning one of the primary methods of serving videos and rich applications on mobile phones is about to disappear			0
@entity293 will fill that gap			0
for us as consumers , that means richer applications and experiences on all our devices			0
in short , 2012 is all about new ways to interact with our devices through touch and voice control , new lightweight ways to share content , a revolution in mobile payments and a plethora of rich web applications -- not to mention the hundreds of new innovations that we 've yet to dream up			1
i ca n't wait .			0

@entity341 founder @entity340 predicts which trends we 'll see more of next year
led by @entity69 , more social networks will offer automated sharing of users ' web activity
companies such as @entity224 may use @entity203 - like voice control to replace the tv remote
@entity285 and @entity286 may release phones with bendable displays in 2012
