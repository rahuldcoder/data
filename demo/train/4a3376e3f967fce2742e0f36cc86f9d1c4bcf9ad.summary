a day after @entity0 exited the @entity1 and vowed never to return while the clay is still blue , a similarly disgruntled @entity3 suffered a shock 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 loss to fellow @entity7 @entity6			1
the world @entity8 said he would join @entity0 in boycotting the @entity1 tournament next year if organizers did not restore standard red clay to the courts			1
" i want to forget this week as soon as possible and move on to the real clay courts , " @entity3 said			2
" it took me at least a week to try to get used to this surface and somehow find a way to win matches and play a decent level of tennis			0
" there is no discussion in my eyes , it 's very simple			0
no blue clay for me			2
" @entity0 lost to fellow @entity27 @entity26 on thursday for his earliest exit in a clay - court tournament in eight years			1
@entity26 was routed 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 by @entity30 in friday 's quarterfinals			1
the blue clay is the brainchild of tournament owner @entity34 , who claims it helps fans see the ball and creates a better viewing experience			2
and while @entity3 and @entity0 have crashed out , @entity39 has thrived at the tournament , beating @entity41 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 on friday to advance to the semifinals			1
the 16 - time @entity44 champion , president of the @entity46 @entity45 , said he sympathized with @entity0 and @entity3			1
" yes of course , i said it from the start			0
it 's not something we actually wanted , " he said			0
" i understand their frustrations			0
it 's a bit tricky for everyone and we definitely have to look into things for next year			0
" @entity39 will replace @entity0 at no. 2 in the rankings if he wins the tournament , thereby increasing his chances of being seeded second for the @entity63			1
@entity39 , who did n't face a single break point against @entity41 , will play @entity6 in the semifinals , while @entity66 meets @entity30 in the other after a comfortable 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 win over @entity69			1
@entity70 , too , has been in blistering form in @entity1 and won a battle of former no. 1s in typically ruthless style , thrashing @entity75 6 - 1 , 6 - 3			1
both players were unbeaten on clay coming into the match , but @entity70 extended her winning streak over the @entity80 to seven while winning her 10th straight match			2
@entity70 said the clay was " extremely slippery " but she would n't join the top men 's stars in skipping @entity1 next year			1
" if i 'm not here next year , it wo n't be because of the clay , " said the 13 - time @entity44 champion			2
" i do n't think there 's been any improvement in the courts over the week , but every clay court is different			0
" this is not the best court -- definitely not what they play like at @entity96 -- but it 's what they use at @entity1			2
" @entity70 will face @entity100 for a place in the final after the @entity104 qualifier upset fifth - seeded @entity105 7 - 6 ( 8 ) , 7 - 6 ( 6 )			1
world no. 1 @entity106 avoided another upset when she recovered to beat @entity63 champion @entity109 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3			1
she will play @entity110 for the sixth time this year in saturday 's semifinals , and said any complaints about the courts would have to wait			0
" i 'm not a fan of this court , that 's for sure , " she added			0
" but i do n't want to sit here and complain about it			0
" nothing is going to change this year			0
we can talk after the tournament about possible changes			0

@entity3 loses 7 - 6 ( 2 ) , 6 - 3 to @entity6 in @entity1
@entity3 says he will not play in @entity1 again while the clay is blue
@entity0 said he would also boycott the event after his loss a day earlier
