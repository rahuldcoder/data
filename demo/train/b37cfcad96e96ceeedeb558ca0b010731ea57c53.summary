@entity0 -- the @entity2 is blocking public release of photos apparently depicting abuse of suspected terrorists and foreign troops in @entity9 custody , and urging the @entity10 to dismiss a lower court ruling ordering the photos to be publicly disclosed , according to court documents			1
defense secretary @entity14 notified the high court late friday that he was issuing an order to block the release			1
the photos have been at the center of a years - long lawsuit by the @entity21			0
@entity22 last month gave the @entity25 administration specific authority to prevent any release of the 44 photos			1
afterward , @entity14 signed a certificate of authorization , or order , to prevent the photos ' release , saying their disclosure would endanger @entity9 troops serving abroad			1
the order covers all photographs taken of people captured or detained in overseas military operations between september 11 , 2001 , the day of the terrorist attacks on @entity36 and @entity0 , and january 22 , 2009 , shortly after president @entity25 took office			2
the @entity2 initially was set to release the images of @entity43 and @entity44 prisoners in response to a @entity47 request filed by the @entity21			1
but @entity25 and the @entity48 objected to the court - ordered release , reversing an earlier executive decision			1
@entity25 had initially agreed to the release , but changed his mind after military leaders privately and intensely urged him to block it			1
the @entity21 criticized the administration 's about - face , saying it " makes a mockery " of @entity25 's campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability , and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners			1
a homeland security appropriations bill passed october 29 by @entity22 and signed by the president grants the @entity2 authority to withhold the photographs			2
the images were gathered as part of a military investigation into allegations that detainees held in @entity44 and @entity43 were tortured and physically abused			0
according to the government legal brief filed with the high court , several of the photos show " soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees			1
" other images described by military reports show prisoners in restrained and humiliating positions			0
military investigations led to criminal charges against some of the soldiers shown in the images			0
the photos currently at issue are separate from those first publicly released in 2006 showing abuse of @entity96 men held at @entity99 's @entity98 prison			2
the @entity36 - based 2nd @entity9 @entity100 ruled in september 2008 that the photos must be released			2
the president later said that doing so " would pose an unacceptable risk of danger to @entity9 troops in @entity44 and @entity43			1
" newest justice @entity106 had served on that appeals court until august , but was not involved in that particular case			0
the high court has delayed for weeks a decision on whether it would accept the @entity21 appeal on the broader issues associated with government authority to block release of potentially embarrassing and inflammatory material by the military			2
the justices will now probably wait to hear from the @entity21 over @entity14 ' order before deciding whether to take the case			0
the @entity120 in may voted for the @entity121 , which would limit the reach of the @entity47 request in this instance			0
the @entity125 adopted a similar provision in october			0
other photos could be released under the earlier appeals court ruling			2
the case is @entity2 v. @entity21 ( 09 - 160 )			0
separately , the administration also urged the high court to dismiss a pending lawsuit by several @entity134 detainees , over their claims of torture and religious discrimination			1
a brief was filed by the @entity48 late friday , the same time as the separate photograph disclosure case			0
four @entity141 men , all @entity96 and former detainees at the military prison at the @entity145 base in @entity146 , had sued onetime defense secretary @entity147 and other top @entity2 officials , saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law			1
a federal appeals court had dismissed the lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims			0
but in june 2008 , the @entity10 allowed @entity134 prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court , and the justices in december urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the @entity141 detainees			1
in the government filing , solicitor general @entity165 told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called " new rights " to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting			0
the high court , she noted , had previously told lower courts " to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation			0
" the case is @entity182 ( 09 - 227 ) .			0

documents show @entity2 urging @entity10 to dismiss ruling ordering photos ' release
defense secretary says showing photos would endanger @entity9 troops abroad
@entity25 , @entity48 have objected to release , reversing executive decision
separately , administration wants @entity199 detainees ' suit alleging torture , discrimination dismissed
