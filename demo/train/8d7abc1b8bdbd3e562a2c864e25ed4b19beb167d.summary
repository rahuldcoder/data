" this is the start of the new @entity7 , " trumpeted @entity0 after his expensively rebuilt side kick started its @entity3 campaign with a 4 - 0 victory over @entity5 at @entity6 sunday			1
a defeat and two lackluster draws prior to the international break had left the @entity11 powerhouses languishing near the foot of the standings , but this was the first match when all his new signings were in action			1
two of them , @entity17 and @entity19 , were on the score sheet while @entity21 and @entity22 also made their first starts			2
with @entity7 4 - 0 up in the second half , @entity26 striker @entity25 was also given his debut from the bench , but could not add to the scoreline			1

@entity38 captain @entity37 is now the joint - third top scorer in @entity3 history			2
the second half proved left eventful but it was @entity17 again who set up @entity42 for the fourth before @entity25 was introduced with 23 minutes remaining , showing a few glimpses of his undoubted talent			1
@entity45 's @entity5 offered little in reply but it was still a morale boosting win for @entity50 , who succeeded @entity51 as @entity7 manager after their poor 2013 - 4 campaign			1
@entity0 has been set a target of a top - three finish to guarantee automatic qualification to the @entity59 next season , but is already setting his sights higher			2
" i want to win the @entity3 title , " he announced after the victory			1
" if it is not this year then the second or third year			0
i want to give a championship to the fans			0
" his side were ending a four - match winless run , which also included an embarrassing defeat to third flight @entity70 in the @entity72			0
" this is special because it is also the birthday of my wife ( @entity76 )			0
i have already given her a present but she said the biggest present shall be the victory			0
we give it to her , " @entity0 added			0
