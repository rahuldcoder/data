@entity0 , @entity1 -- it took the tragedy of @entity7 's @entity6 's death for the media , for @entity1 , to realize just how brightly @entity10 ' star had ascended after the @entity11 when he ran against able - bodied athletes			1
shock over the shooting reverberated across the world , not just at home			2
his story had touched people -- it was the classic tale of triumph over adversity , of hope and determination			2
and then it was all over			0
the fallout was immediate , furious and personal			0
@entity1 seemed to have a deep emotional attachment to @entity10 the hero and then , inevitably , his fall from grace			1
the interest in the case and the court case has never really subsided , every twist and turn has been analyzed and debated and there is still an insatiable appetite for the story			2
i first met @entity10 in 2008 at his home , in the bedroom that was to become a crime scene five years later			1
he was young , enthusiastic and eager			0
sitting on the edge of his bed , he showed our camera his different prosthetics and his stumps , explaining patiently about his birth defect and where his legs had been amputated as a child			0
he seemed determined , somewhat naÃ ¯ ve and enthusiastic about his future			0
by @entity52 last year he was a different person			0
he walked into the magistrate 's court days after he shot his girlfriend and looked like a blank , broken man			2
the implications of his actions -- whether it was intentional or negligent or neither -- were etched on his face			0
his future plans and the life that of the woman he said he loved were over			0
the vomiting , the crying and the sobbing in court seemed genuine , i did n't think he was ' faking it ' as the state and critics suggested			0
no matter whether he 's judged innocent or guilty it was clear @entity10 ' emotions were raw , remorseful			1
he still treasures photographs of @entity74 and him together , his uncle @entity75 told us in an interview at the home where @entity10 is living			2
the vomiting and retching were a physical manifestation of the gut - wrenching reality of his actions			0
later , psychiatrists said it was a result of post-traumatic stress disorder throughout the court drama and the media focus on @entity10 , @entity74 's @entity6 's mother , june , sat a few meters from him -- still , stony - faced and stoic			1
i do n't know how she managed to compose herself , especially on the days in court when @entity10 described the night her daughter died and then , shockingly , the day the state showed the court images of her dead daughter 's bloodied head			1
on thursday , judge @entity101 is set to deliver her verdict in the case , with possibilities ranging from a life sentence to @entity10 -- nicknamed the " @entity10 " for the prosthetic devices on his legs -- leaving court a free man			1
for all the families involved , this has been a tragedy played out in the glare of cameras and intense public interest			1
for our @entity2 team covering the story since february 14 , 2013 , it 's been important for us not have to have taken sides , or to reduce @entity74 's death and @entity10 's actions to a tawdry soap opera			1
instead , we 've tried to instead reflect public sentiment and to let the justice system and the legal process wind its way to a conclusion			0
