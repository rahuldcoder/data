-- air travelers usually are prepared for the occasional hectic and overcrowded flight			0
but all are hoping they 'll at least be able to sit down			0
@entity4 , 57 , stood for the length of his @entity7 flight in july after a fellow passenger occupied half of his seat			1
the non-stop flight from @entity12 to @entity13 lasted seven hours			0
" i did n't fly from @entity18 to @entity13 , " @entity4 said on consumer advocate @entity15 's blog , @entity17			1
" @entity0 recently reported on the extensive flight delays that travelers experienced during last month 's snowstorm			0
@entity22 has begun reimbursing those customers for their eight - hour tarmac waits , and @entity4 feels @entity7 should do more to address the issue of his extended standing			1
he initially had an empty seat next to him on @entity28 , but a late passenger sat there and took more space than he paid for			2
" his size required both armrests to be raised up and allowed for his body to cover half of my seat , " @entity4 said			1
the man was very polite and expressed regret over the situation , said @entity4 , who notified the flight crew that he was unable to fasten his seat belt and asked if he could move to business class			1
as the flight was filled to capacity , and as passengers are not permitted to sit in the flight attendants ' jump seats , @entity4 found himself strolling through the cabin for hours			2
flight attendants apparently asked him to remain seated and fasten his seat belt , but he said the co-passenger was seated on his seat belt fastener , making this impossible			1
that meant that , though he did manage to wedge himself into his seat for the takeoff and landing , he was unable to comply with the requirement that his seat belt be fastened at those times			1
@entity59 spokeswoman @entity58 told @entity0 that it also is against regulations to stand for an entire flight and that passengers are always encouraged to remain in their seats			0
@entity7 issued a statement saying it recognizes the inconvenience of the situation			2
" we all understand how sensitive a subject passengers of size can present , but we should never compromise safety and we need every passenger to help us ensure that every flight operates safely by complying with those crew members ' instructions			1
" when the plane landed , @entity4 said , he immediately contacted a @entity7 agent who referred him to the company headquarters in @entity79			1
though the airline offered him a $ 200 voucher for his trouble , @entity4 said , he did not accept it			2
after months of unsuccessful communication , he said , he went to the @entity59 , which notified him that @entity7 considered the matter closed			2
@entity0 could not independently confirm the details			0
although he is disappointed at the amount he was offered , @entity4 said , his motivation for speaking out now is not financial			2
" my reason for bringing this up is strictly and solely for the airline to look at their safety procedures , " he told @entity0			0
although @entity7 expresses regret over the situation , the airline does feel the matter has been resolved and that @entity4 's concerns have been noted			1
" we have attempted to address this customer 's service concerns , but offering increasing amounts of compensation based on a threat of a safety violation is n't really fair -- especially when the passenger himself said he did n't follow the crew members ' instructions and fasten his seat belt , " @entity7 said in a written statement			1
" if there was a safety issue -- we will address that professionally and with the proper attention toward preventing it from happening again			0
we have already provided feedback on the service issues with the team involved , and thank mr. @entity4 for making his concerns known			0
" some airlines have policies in place to handle issues with " passengers or customers of size			0
" according to its website , @entity127 requires customers who do not fit in their seats ( which are 17 inches wide ) to purchase an extra seat before boarding , but will refund them for the seat if the flight is not full			0
@entity135 , which is being purchased by @entity127 , has the same policy			0
@entity137 and @entity138 require passengers to be able to lower their armrests and fasten their seat belt with no more than one seat belt extender			1
@entity143 requires that passengers lower their armrests and fasten their seat belt with no extenders			1
passengers may be required to purchase an additional seat if they fall outside of this protocol			0
@entity7 has a policy that allows for extenders , or booking the passenger on a later flight			2
if neither is possible , the passenger may be charged for an additional seat			0
@entity4 's grievances extend to the gate crew members who did n't do more to follow this policy .			1

@entity4 says he was forced out of his seat by the " passenger of size " beside him
he feels @entity7 should do more to compensate him for his extended standing
" he did n't follow *...* instructions and fasten his seat belt , " @entity7 says
