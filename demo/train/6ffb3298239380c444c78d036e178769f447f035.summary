@entity0 , @entity1 -- a row of 12 coffins , each draped with a flag , symbolizes the human cost of an explosion that destroyed much of a small @entity1 town and left the residents of that town searching for answers			1
hundreds of firefighters from across the nation and other first - responders joined grieving families and president @entity17 and the first lady at the @entity19 in @entity0 , site of a memorial service thursday for some of the people killed in a fertilizer plant explosion last week in the nearby town of @entity25			1
the president told the crowd that no words adequately describe the courage displayed by those who died			1
" what i can do is offer the love and support and prayers of the nation , " @entity17 said			1
@entity17 told the families and friends of the those killed that they were not forgotten , saying " our hearts have been here in your time of tribulation			1
" he promised them the nation will help them rebuild and reclaim their small community of about 3,000 people			2
before the president and first lady @entity49 joined the residents of @entity25 at the service at @entity53 , the president 's helicopter flew over @entity25 and circled several times over the flattened structures and scarred earth			2
the @entity57 met privately with the families after the service			1
@entity1 gov. @entity60 promised the families of the first - responders who died that their loved ones would not be forgotten			1
" first - responders know better than anyone that there 's no such thing as a routine emergency , " @entity60 told the crowd , " but it did n't slow them down as they raced toward that burning factory			1
" @entity60 urged the families to remember that " the spirit that drove those men we love -- they live on " and asked the crowd to " let their deeds serve as an inspiration " to service of others			1
the families of the victims recorded emotional video tributes that were played during the service			1
some were somber , some were mixed with light - hearted memories			1
" @entity99 always hated the word ' hero , ' " said @entity93 , whose brother was attending a @entity96 class when the fire that preceded the explosion began			1
" he and i shared the belief that heroes are persons ( whose names ) are etched in marble			1
and that a hero is a sacred and solemn term reserved for only those who paid the ultimate price when others would falter or run			2
" my brother would disagree , but i firmly believe that all privy to this incident can attest that my brother and all those who lay with him are heroes now and forever			1
" earlier , as the service began , everyone in the arena stood in complete silence as family and friends of the victims filed in			2
some of the family members wept as they passed the flag - draped coffins -- 10 with @entity128 flags and two with @entity1 flags -- and photos in front of each one			1
family members hugged one another when they arrived at their seats			2
the service -- which honored the 10 first - responders killed april 17 and two friends of first - responders who also answered the call -- included roll call as the name of each victim was read , followed by one toll from a bell			1
an officer at the foot of each coffin saluted			2
then the bell rang five times , paused , rang five more times , paused again , and rang a final five times to signal the fallen had answered their final call			1
each family was given a flag and a helmet in remembrance			1
a bagpiper played " @entity160			2
" in all , 14 people were killed by the blast , including two other people who died in their apartment nearby			1
before thursday 's service , emotions were raw in @entity0 , the central @entity1 city about 20 miles south of the scene of the blast			2
many onlookers cried as they lined the street outside as a procession of fire trucks slowly passed			2
one man held a large @entity1 flag , bowed his head and rested a cowboy hat over his heart			1
hundreds of bikers from the @entity179 stood at attention as the rescue vehicles passed by			2
before leaving @entity182 , @entity17 signed a proclamation ordering all flags in the state to be flown at half - staff for the day			1
city workers from @entity0 replaced @entity25 workers thursday so they could attend funerals and take a break from trying to repair the city 's water system and cleaning up the town			2
on wednesday , an @entity128 flag was raised and a bugler played taps at a memorial service at the blast site			1
a few miles away , one of the victims , @entity199 , was laid to rest			0
@entity199 , a 52 - year - old @entity201 firefighter who lived in @entity25 , was one of the first - responders who died			1
one of the coffins at thursday 's service represented @entity199			2
hundreds of firefighters from @entity201 and other areas surrounding @entity25 came for the funeral , the first to be held for the responders killed in the blast			0
firefighters lined the sidewalk as @entity199 ' flag - draped coffin was carried out and loaded into the back of a @entity201 fire truck to be carried to the cemetery			1
bagpipes played as the coffin went through the crowd			0
before and after : @entity1 plant explosion the investigation continues " shovel by shovel , " investigators are combing through the charred remains of the leveled fertilizer distributor after the april 17 explosion in @entity25			0
much of the landscape surrounding the @entity93 is unrecognizable			0
what was once a corn silo appears to have crumpled from the blast			0
a blue tarp covers the shell of a rail car			0
a crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep sits where a building once stood			0
the crater is now filled with mangled metal and crumbs of mortar			0
concrete chunks , some the size of shopping carts , are strewn hundreds of yards away from the blast site			0
losses from the explosion will probably top $ 100 million , said @entity246 , a spokesman for the @entity247 of @entity1			0
but amid the devastation , forensic mappers are hoping to find clues			0
hundreds of small pink flags indicate anything on the ground that crews want forensic investigators to take a closer look at			0
officials face a difficult task in reconstructing the fire that preceded the deadly explosion			0
still unknown : what types of chemicals and in what quantities were stored at the facility			0
town devastated by explosion is guided by the @entity25 way putting the pieces together one official likened the investigation to a jigsaw puzzle			0
" right now , think of that coffee table where all 100 pieces are gathered around , " @entity272 , an official with the @entity273 , told the @entity274			0
" now , we 're going to pull them together			0
" @entity279 , special agent in charge of the bureau 's @entity281 , said that determining what started the initial fire is key			0
" we feel the explosion was caused by the fire , so we 've got to determine what the cause and the origin of the fire was , and that 's why we 're ... attempting to re-enact that fire scene , " he said			0
" a fire scene is complicated in itself			0
but you compound that with an explosion , and it really complicates the issue			0
" investigators have ruled out the possibility that natural causes ignited the fire			0
