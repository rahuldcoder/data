in " @entity1 " it 's the end of the world as we know it and while no one feels fine , millions love reading about it			1
hitting bookstores october 16 , " @entity1 " is the highly - anticipated new novel from award - winning author @entity8			1
it 's the second in a planned trilogy about a frightening man - made apocalypse			1
the first in the series , " @entity14 , " was an instant bestseller in 2010 winning widespread praise from critics and a worldwide legion of fans			0
master of horror @entity21 was among @entity24 's most vocal supporters			1
" @entity14 " also received national attention for the back story behind the book			1
originally inspired by @entity24 's then 8 - year - old daughter , at its heart it 's a story about a little girl who saves the world			1
the book generated a bidding war among publishers , ultimately selling for more than $ 3 million			2
film rights were also snapped up for a reported seven - figure payday			0
@entity24 went from being a little - known author and @entity40 professor to overnight millionaire			1
in the series , @entity24 presents a desolate view of the future , where a mysterious plague turns people into blood - sucking monsters , cities crumble , much of the @entity49 is turned into a wasteland and millions of people die in the resulting chaos			1
nevertheless , readers love @entity24 's fresh , intelligent combination of science fiction , horror and thriller , reminiscent of @entity21 's " @entity58 " and @entity60 's " @entity59			1
" " @entity1 " of the title are the dozen vampire - like creatures created in a secret government experiment gone horribly wrong			1
now these twelve virals control an army of the undead , out to extinguish what 's left of the human race			1
the new book briefly returns to " year zero " of the global plague			2
it reintroduces readers to some favorite characters from " @entity14 , " expands the cast , widens the scope of the story and gives the plot a " 1984 " orwellian twist			2
@entity81 recently spoke to @entity24 from his home in @entity84 , @entity85 , where he 's hard at work on the third and final book in the trilogy			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity81 : you 've talked about how your daughter was the original inspiration behind " @entity14			2
" did she have any input on your new novel ? @entity24 : she did at the outset			1
when she and i conceived the first book we talked about the sequels and their basic narrative shape			2
so in that sense her handprints are upon it			0
that said , the 8 - year - old girl who took her bike rides with me and talked about the novel is now a 16 - year - old learning to drive with her own life and her own concerns and in fact her own writing			0
so on a day - to - day basis , my go - to person now i would say has been my wife			2
whenever i hit a snag , we take a walk around the block and talk about it and rather remarkably by the time we return it 's not uncommon for the problem to be solved			2
so for each book there 's been a woman in my life who 's played a pretty big role			1
in this one i 'd have to give a tip of the hat to my wife			2
@entity81 : when we last talked you said , " the hazard of most trilogies is the middle book			2
" so was this novel harder to write than the last ? @entity24 : it was different			1
for each book i 've had to sit down and look at what new challenges i have to work through			2
one of the best things about my job is that i do n't have a boss , so i can take each project and do what interests me			0
one of the things i always want to do is never write the same book twice			2
i want each book to pose a new challenge and force me to stretch as a writer			2
for this book what i wanted to do was avoid the well - known trap of middle books in a trilogy , which is that they 're kind of a long second act , just a bridge between books one and three			1
what i decided to do was to make sure i wrote a book that had fresh terms established for it , so that it would pick up where the last story left off but it would also reset the situation			2
which is why in this book at the start , you go back to year zero to see something you did not see the first time			2
it changes the rules of the game for my major characters in their quest to rid the world of the great viral plague			0
that for me was the strategy that i conceived of very early on			0
what do i want to do in this book that 's different from the middle books of most trilogies , in the same way that when i wrote " @entity14 , " i said what do i want to do that 's different from most apocalypse novels ? once i got that clear in my mind i realized how the book would operate			1
@entity81 : you 've described " @entity14 " as an ode to " @entity192 , " so what novel was your inspiration for " the twelve ? " @entity24 : for each of the three books i wanted to work within different genres			1
the first book is a bunch of things			2
it 's a horror novel , apocalyptic fiction , science fiction , but i think it 's very much a road novel and a @entity207			0
at the core of that novel you have characters who are encountering the @entity213 with the same kind of sense of awe and unknown as the first @entity218 settlers			0
this book , i wanted to draw upon my love of espionage fiction to bring yet another kind of energy into the trilogy			1
i like really well - written spy novels , for instance i 'm a huge fan of @entity227			0
but if i had to pick a book that was really operating in the background it would be @entity231 's " 1984			1
" it 's always been a very important book for me			1
i wrote my senior thesis in college on " 1984			1
" i think it 's a much more complex and interesting book than its given credit for			1
how does propaganda operate , how do you gain complicity ? i was very interested in these kinds of questions and the psychological mechanics of how totalitarianism operates			0
in " @entity1 " people will see that influence in the background i 'm sure			1
@entity8 talks about his new novel , " @entity1 " @entity81 : you 're very active on social media			1
what has your interaction been like with fans online ? @entity24 : social media is the perfect thing for writers and for people who work alone			1
i ca n't stroll down to the photocopy room and kill a little time chatting about what the @entity260 did this weekend			0
i 'm all alone in my office , so it 's absolutely a way of breaking the trance of loneliness that writers have to live in			0
for a writer it gives you the opportunity to interact with your fans without leaving your house or going on a book tour			0
the thing about " @entity14 " trilogy is , unlike my earlier work , those books had readers , but these books have fans			0
because the books are still unfolding it 's a way to interact with people in the middle of the story			0
that did not happen with my first two books			0
now i hear from people all the time			0
i love interacting with fans this way			0
its fun , it 's easy			0
i think how great it would have been when i was a young reader to be able to do this			0
@entity298 really made me want to become a writer			0
i remember a night in college when my roommate and i tried to call him on the phone			0
it did n't work out , but you really want to talk to these people , they matter to you			0
@entity308 is a way of bridging that gap			0
i appreciate it not only as a writer but as the reader i was as a young man			0
@entity81 : what 's the status of book three , any hints ? @entity24 : i 'm sort of at the point now i feel like i 'm hitting my stride with the third book			1
my goal is for the third novel in some ways ( is that it ) follows the design of the earlier books , which is to briefly take the reader back to year zero			0
to see yet again something they did not see the first time that resets the terms of the story , so that the book has its own propulsive engine			0
the only other thing i can say is it 's the last book so the big questions that remain will be answered			1
that 's the job of the third book is to end the story			1
the goal is for the book to come out in 2014 , and all mysteries will be revealed			0
