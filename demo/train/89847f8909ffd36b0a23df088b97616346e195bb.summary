-- among the familiar faces in @entity3 's new film " @entity4 " is one less familiar these days , someone who has n't been seen on the big screen in 12 years : @entity7			1
in the role of @entity13 ' blue collar ex-husband , the crass comedian 's appearance might be a surprise to some , especially with his character 's vanity - free gray hair			2
" you know what ? i 'm not 20 years old anymore ! " @entity7 said with a laugh			1
" i do color my hair , and they did enhance the gray , but i was like , ' oh , man ! ' " @entity3 rediscovered @entity7 along with the rest of @entity28 when the @entity7 played a version of himself as a comic looking for a comeback in a five - episode arc on " @entity33			1
" coincidentally , it triggered his own comeback , which @entity7 prefers to call " a resurgence			1
" " it 's an unbelievable thing to me , " he said			0
" i 've always had belief in myself , belief that i could come back , and i 've always sort of marched to the beat of my own drum , but to get this movie and to work with all these people -- @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity13 -- some of the greats , i 'm nothing but humbled by this experience			0
" these days , @entity7 knows from humble			1
three years ago , " during the recession , " he was down on his luck and in need of cash , so he headed to @entity53 to try to his luck at blackjack			0
" it was a tough time , " he said			0
" desperate times call for desperate measures			0
" during his gambling spree , @entity7 earned a little over a million dollars , but it was easy come , easy go			1
" after i took care of some bills and bought some cars , i lost most of it , " he said			0
" i call it the summer of ' @entity68 , ' because it was just a party			0
" by the end of that summer , @entity7 was broke again			1
( it 's a scenario that proved helpful for his " @entity4 " character , @entity72 , who won $ 200,000 in a lottery , only to lose it all in an ill - advised investment			1
) strangely enough , " that whole thing led to ' @entity33 , ' " @entity7 said			1
while lamenting his lack of funds with his son at a local @entity81 , the comedian ran into an old friend , who connected him with a mutual friend the very next day : " @entity33 " creator @entity84			1
and with the extended arc @entity85 gave him , @entity7 was once again in demand			1
" i was like , ' you know what ? i 'll just rebuild my standup career , ' " @entity7 said			1
a @entity92 comedy special followed , along with a residency at the @entity94 in @entity53			0
" and through all this , i get the call that @entity3 wants to meet with me , " he said			1
" i thought my manager was messing with me ! " @entity7 met with @entity3 on @entity98 -- a location seen and cited in " @entity4 " as the most desirable of @entity100 addresses , one that means wealth , class and elegance to the titular and very status - conscious character @entity4 ( played by @entity44 )			1
" we spoke about comedy , where we both started out , where we both grew up " in @entity109 , @entity7 said of his meeting with the director			1
" and i could n't believe it			0
he 's one of the people in @entity113 i have a lot of respect for , because he 's done movies that have made me laugh , ' @entity117 ' being one of my favorites			0
" @entity3 explained that he wanted the comedian / actor to do something meaty for him			1
up until now , @entity7 had a spotty film career , the highlights being a cameo as @entity127 's friendly bouncer in 1986 's " pretty in @entity128 , " a part as @entity131 's macho suitor in the 1988 raunchy comedy " @entity133 ? " and a starring role in 1990 's " @entity135			1
" usually , his character was an extension of his on - stage persona , the @entity7 ( called the @entity139 in " @entity133 ? " )			2
" i refer to that persona as a brick wall , " @entity7 said			2
if @entity7 breaks up with a girl at 8 p.m. , another one will be coming over at 8:10			2
" that persona was popular in films for a bit : " @entity133 ? " reshot the ending to give him a happy ending with @entity131 's character , @entity7 said , " because audiences wanted more of the @entity139			2
" but " @entity135 " was a critical and commercial bomb , and @entity7 's movie career never quite recovered			2
after watching him on " entourage , " he thought @entity7 would be perfect for the role of @entity72 ( for which he originally considered @entity156 , until he decided he was " too nice " and gave him a different role )			1
at the beginning of " @entity4 , " we 're told that @entity72 and @entity160 ( @entity13 ' character ) are divorced and that he used to hit her			2
but even in flashbacks of their marriage , he 's not violent			0
" @entity3 told me , ' well , you know , he gets drunk ; maybe he smacks his wife around a little , ' " @entity7 said			1
" and then i read the lines , and the lines did n't really match up to that			0
he seemed like a regular guy who want to take care of his family , who wants the best for his family , and the guy is just crushed			0
" @entity7 wonders whether @entity3 told him that his character was a brute to get his mind " in a certain place " and if that was part of the director 's method			1
" whatever it was , it did the trick , " he said			0
with that direction , he was able to find hidden depths to @entity72 and do something he felt he 'd " never approached before on film , " which was play " a real human being , a full person , " essentially , to act			0
" it was kind of thrilling , " the comic said			0
to help his character 's antagonism toward his sister - in - law , @entity4 , she of the ill advice that caused him to lose his money and his marriage , @entity7 drew upon his relationships with his former @entity202 neighbors			1
" oh , they hated me in @entity202 , " he chuckled			0
" once you have a certain reputation , you have problems , and the @entity109 in me would come out			0
" if he could do it again , @entity7 said , he 'd work with @entity3 " any day			1
" " all he needs to do is call and say , ' i need you on @entity209 and @entity210 tomorrow , ' and i 'm there , " @entity7 said			2
" that 's how great i think he is			0
" in the meantime , @entity7 hopes to recruit some actors himself			2
he 's looking for someone to play him in the film adaptation of his upcoming memoir , " @entity218			0
" @entity7 said @entity219 met with him to discuss the part			2
" it was funny to watch , actually , " @entity7 said			2
" by the time he left the room , he was doing an impersonation , not of my stage persona but of the way i am as myself , when i 'm not on stage			0
" whoever takes the part , @entity7 is bracing himself for the surreality of seeing himself on screen in a whole new way			2
" it 's weird enough to see myself on screen playing a part ! " he said with a laugh			0
" that 's going to be strange			0
