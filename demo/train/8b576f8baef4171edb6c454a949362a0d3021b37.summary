when " @entity2 " host @entity1 tore into sen. @entity3 for complaining about the @entity4 removing classified documents from her staff 's computers after giving the intelligence community a pass on spying on private citizens , he joined a chorus of civil liberties advocates who say she 's being hypocritical			1
" what is incredible about these accusations is they are not coming from senator @entity19 ' privacy is important ' @entity20 or senator @entity21 ' do n't kill me with a flying robot ' @entity23 , " @entity1 said			0
" they are coming from @entity3 ' so the @entity25 is looking at your data ' @entity3			2
" he then played a montage of clips showing the many instances in which @entity3 , chairman of the @entity31 , has supported @entity25 snooping on private citizens			1
those who have long complained that neither @entity34 nor the intelligence community have done enough to safeguard the rights of private citizens find it ironic that , for months , the spy agency and the @entity31 charged with its oversight have waged a behind - the - scenes battle accusing each other of improper snooping			1
the @entity43 is weighing whether to investigate @entity4 claims that @entity31 staffers accessed material they should n't have seen while reviewing millions of documents at a @entity49 facility			0
those same advocates find the complaints of @entity3 , who has been one of the intelligence community 's staunchest supporters , as especially disingenuous			1
@entity3 says @entity4 spied on @entity31 computers " as a privacy advocate , she has gotten angry about spying on ( @entity58 chancellor ) @entity59 and spying on herself			1
but being ok with spying on the rest of us is questionable , " said @entity60 , a former @entity61 agent and a fellow with the @entity63			0
@entity3 did not respond to a request for comment			0
during a fiery speech tuesday that stunned lawmakers and members of the intelligence community , @entity3 , a @entity69 @entity68 , accused the @entity4 of secretly taking classified documents from her staff 's computers during an oversight investigation			1
her comments made public a private long running saga over the review of documents related to the post 9/11 @entity83 administration program for questioning terror suspects -- a practice that ultimately was ended by president @entity87 in 2009			0
@entity4 director @entity88 challenged @entity3 's claims			1
what are the @entity4 and @entity31 fighting about ? privacy advocates and civil liberty groups hailed @entity3 's diatribe against the @entity4 's tactics as a watershed moment in urging stronger checks on the executive branch 's spying practices			1
" it 's highly significant that a senator with senator @entity3 's credentials in working with the intelligence community would go to the @entity31 floor and make a constitutionally protected speech about how the @entity4 is undermining a critical oversight role , " said @entity100 , a senior counsel with the nonprofit @entity101			1
a number of her congressional colleagues applauded her speech as well			0
" senator @entity3 is a dedicated public servant who deserves enormous credit for speaking publicly about this dispute , which goes to the heart of the separation of powers , " sen. @entity112 , a @entity113 @entity68 , told @entity114 in a statement			2
" she has spoken to the conscience of every senator , of both parties			0
she is standing up for the principles on which this country was founded , and the rest of us must follow her example , " he said			0
@entity112 has been a steady critic of the intelligence community 's practices -- especially the sweeping @entity25 surveillance programs publicized by @entity136 's leaks -- and has stridently questioned claims by national security officials that the government 's bulk collection of phone records thwarted terror attacks			0
however , privacy and civil liberties advocates took issue with @entity3 's pique			1
they also see a double - standard in the outrage of other lawmakers such as @entity150 sen. @entity150 of @entity151 , who also called the allegations " dangerous to a democracy			0
" these types of actions have always been " dangerous to a democracy " even when they happen to ordinary private citizens , civil liberties advocates said			1
" it 's clear the @entity4 was trying to play ' keep - away ' with documents relevant to an investigation by their overseers in @entity34 , and that 's a serious constitutional concern , " @entity136 , a former @entity25 contractor , told @entity158 in a statement tuesday			2
" but it 's equally if not more concerning that we 're seeing another ' @entity169 , ' where an elected official does not care at all that the rights of millions of ordinary citizens are violated by our spies , but suddenly it 's a scandal when a politician finds out the same thing happens to them , " he said			2
@entity179 intel chair warns of penalty if @entity4 searched @entity31 computers privacy and civil liberty advocates hope more oversight will occur now that members of @entity34 have gotten a personal taste of intelligence gathering practices they find objectionable			2
" we 've had 12 years of an intelligence community acting with very little checks on it , " said @entity188 , a senior legislative counsel with the @entity189			0
" the reason they are so out of control is that there 's been very little oversight being exercised by @entity34 or the courts			0
" outrage by both lawmakers and private citizens will build support for reforms , @entity58 said			1
" hopefully , now that @entity3 has this new found skepticism , she will open the lid so that the @entity208 public can see what has been done in their name in the past ten years , " @entity60 said .			2

privacy and civil liberties advocates skeptical of @entity3 's @entity4 snooping complaints
advocates say lawmakers should feel equally outraged at snooping on private citizens
they hail @entity3 's critique of the @entity4 's *stonewalling* , snooping and want more to be done
public and congressional *pressure* the key to reforms , privacy advocates say
