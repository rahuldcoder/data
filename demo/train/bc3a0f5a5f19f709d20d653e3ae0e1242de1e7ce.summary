hosts @entity1 have won their first ever @entity3 title , the continent 's equivalent of the @entity6 , after beating @entity7 2 - 1			1
in a pulsating final played in front of more than 70,000 supporters at @entity1 , @entity12 , the @entity8 took the lead against the run of play just before half time thanks to a stunning goal by @entity17			1
@entity17 , a 22 year old midfielder who plays for @entity19 in the @entity21 third tier , spun away from his marker before crashing a shot into the bottom right hand corner of the goal , the first goal @entity7 had conceded in the entire tournament			1
extra time goal @entity1 looked to have held out for 90 minutes and a famous @entity3 title -- their first since switching to the @entity31 from the smaller less competitive @entity32 -- until @entity34 striker @entity33 equalized in the first minute of injury time , silencing the boisterous home crowd and sending the final to extra time			1
but @entity1 stormed back and @entity39 shot home from close range after a defensive mix up to seal the victory			2
" it 's a massive moment for @entity51 football , " former @entity45 and @entity46 forward @entity44 told @entity47 after the game			2
" all i can recall is all those people who did n't believe in us , " he added			0
" this is one of the biggest moments in sport for @entity1 because this is an @entity58 tournament that 's so difficult to win -- and a tournament we were never supposed to win with this group of players			1
" @entity44 's last stand ? the tournament is likely to be @entity44 's last after a glittering career in @entity21 and international soccer			0
but @entity8 ' coach @entity68 believes that @entity44 still has much to offer the team , with qualification for the 2018 @entity72 finals in @entity73 next on the agenda			0
" i 'd be surprised , " @entity68 said of @entity44 's rumored retirement			0
" he 's had a fantastic tournament			0
he has n't said anything to me			0
i have n't had any discussion with him about his future and i 'd be surprised if i had to because again he was a very important part of our team			0
" if @entity44 was part of the past , one of the last members of @entity1 's so - called " golden generation " that qualified for three @entity72 finals in a row , then goal scoring hero @entity17 could be the future			1
he was named player of the tournament , having been involved in six goals over the course of the tournament			0
switch to @entity31 the victory was also vindication of @entity1 's decision to join the @entity31			1
up until 2005 @entity1 had competed in the @entity32 -- the smallest of @entity103 's six confederations -- with little in the way of true competition aside from the occasional matches against @entity107			2
the @entity32 also offers just half a qualification spot for the @entity72 finals : a playoff match against tough opponents in @entity112 or @entity58			0
a 31 - 0 victory against @entity114 in a qualification match for the 2002 @entity72 finals -- a world record that still stands today -- forced @entity51 soccer to focus on joining the @entity31 , which they did in 2005			1
@entity58 unhappy ? as well as holding @entity58 's most prestigious international title , club side @entity123 famously won last year 's @entity125 final against @entity127 's @entity126 , prompting allegations that not everyone in @entity58 soccer is happy with @entity1 's success			1
after the @entity8 beat the @entity131 in the semifinal , one leading figure appeared to express concern that @entity1 had taken one of the @entity31 's prized @entity72 qualification spots yet had given little back in return			1
" yes , it is true , there are indications that confirm that there is a desire among @entity58 federations to remove @entity1 from the @entity31 , " @entity137 , the @entity138 president of the @entity31 , said in an interview with @entity141 newspaper @entity140			1
" i also know that the @entity148 are not the only ones that are not convinced with the value of @entity1 staying within the @entity58 football family			2
" @entity137 later denied the comments , saying they had been " manipulated "			0
" i 'm really stunned with the timing to bring this topic out			0
it 's a false topic , " he told @entity1 's @entity157 newspaper			2
" to read a story like this is really sad because there 's no truth in it			0
the success of this tournament has exceeded our expectations			0
i wo n't let a story like this affect the success of the tournament we had in @entity1			2
" after @entity1 's victory @entity137 was quick to praise the team and the country 's hosting of the tournament , telling the @entity31 's website that the " competition that has been remarkable in spirit and in passion , and we have @entity1 to thank for that			1
