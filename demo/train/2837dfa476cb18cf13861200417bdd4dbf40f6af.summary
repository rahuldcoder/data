on march 10 , 1968 , sen. @entity0 made a pilgrimage to the central @entity3 farm town of @entity4 to attend a @entity5 and to help @entity6 break a 25 - day fast intended to draw attention to the plight of farmworkers			1
some of @entity0 's advisers had warned him not to go			0
he was thinking about entering the race for president , and his inner circle worried that the gesture to @entity6 , president of the @entity15 , might antagonize farm groups , a powerful political force in the @entity18			1
@entity0 went anyway , citing his fondness and respect for @entity6 , whom he called " one of the heroic figures of our time			1
" weakened by his fast , @entity6 still managed to write a powerful statement that was read by a union supporter , the rev. @entity27			1
it went : " it is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives do we find life			0
i am convinced that the truest act of courage , the strongest act of manliness is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice			0
to be a man is to suffer for others			0
@entity43 help us to be men ! " @entity45 to honor iconic @entity47 activist with new monument @entity0 responded by telling those who had gathered : " when your children and grandchildren take their place in @entity58 , going to high school and college , and taking good jobs at good pay , when you look at them you will say , ' i did this , i was there at the point of difficulty and danger			1
' and though you may be old and bent from many years of hard labor , no man will stand taller than you when you say , ' i was there			0
i marched with @entity6 ! ' " president @entity45 made his own pilgrimage monday to the farmland of central @entity3			1
in his first visit there as president , @entity45 will formally establish the @entity72 on a piece of property in @entity75 , east of @entity76			1
known as @entity72 , or @entity78 , the property served as the national headquarters of the @entity15			1
@entity0 made his visit despite the politics of the day , but @entity45 's visit is all about politics			1
the @entity6 dedication is some campaign aide 's bright idea of how to turn out @entity47 voters -- 70 % of whom support @entity45 over @entity90 -- on @entity91			1
it 's a rookie mistake -- the kind you expect from people whose knowledge of @entity58 's largest minority is limited to mariachis and margaritas			0
i have studied and written about @entity6 and the @entity15 for more than 25 years			2
i was also born and raised in the @entity18 , where so much of the @entity15 drama played out			0
i had a confrontation with @entity6 in 1990 over the union 's failures , and i 've had a few run - ins since then with @entity15 vice president @entity107			1
and i can tell you this much : politically , @entity45 hit a foul ball			2
@entity6 has significance as a historical figure			2
it is because of the @entity15 that farmworkers now have clean water and toilets in the fields , collective bargaining , lunch breaks and other legal protections			0
but @entity6 was never a leader for all @entity121			1
@entity122 and @entity123 - @entity58 might represent more than two - thirds of the @entity58 @entity47 population , but the other third is made up of @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and others			2
to them , @entity6 probably means nothing			2
even @entity123 immigrants do n't have a stake in the legend of @entity6 ; they hear the name , and most of them probably think of the great @entity123 boxer , @entity137			2
the group that @entity6 has the strongest hold on is @entity123 , but not all of them			2
he matters to baby boomers , but not to @entity142 or the so - called millennial generation			0
and given that most @entity123 now live in the cities -- @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 -- how are they supposed to relate to the memory of someone who was focused on the farms ? in the end , the small sliver of @entity121 who will be impressed by @entity45 's gesture -- @entity123 - @entity58 lefties over 50 -- was going to vote for him anyway			2
so where 's the benefit ? last , most @entity121 disapprove of the president 's heavy - handed immigration policies and record number of deportations			0
it 's immigration , stupid , say @entity47 voters in @entity168 @entity6 earned many titles in his life , but " champion of immigrants " was not one of them			1
he was primarily a labor leader who was concerned about illegal immigrants undercutting union members , either by accepting lower wages or crossing picket lines			1
he never pretended to be anything else , and he resisted attempts by others to widen his agenda			0
when he pulled workers out of the field during a strike , the last thing he wanted was to see a crew of illegal immigrant workers take away his leverage			0
according to many historical accounts , @entity6 ordered union members to call the @entity192 and report illegal immigrants who were working in the fields so that they could be deported			1
some @entity15 officials were also known to picket @entity192 offices to demand a crackdown on illegal immigrants			0
in the 70s , the @entity15 set up a " wet line " to stop undocumented @entity123 immigrants from entering the @entity58			0
under the supervision of @entity6 's cousin , @entity203 , @entity15 members tried at first to persuade @entity122 not to cross the border			2
one time when that did n't work , they physically attacked and beat them up to scare them off , according to reports at the time			0
the @entity211 said that the @entity15 was engaged in a " campaign of random terror against anyone hapless enough to fall into its net			0
" a couple of decades later , in their book " the fight in the @entity225 , " journalists @entity216 and @entity218 recalled the border violence and wrote that the issue of illegal immigration was " particularly vexing " for @entity6			2
@entity15 loyalists will never admit to this ugly history			1
but that does n't change it			0
and this is the person @entity45 is honoring today with a national monument ? one immigration hardliner paying his respects to another			1
i guess , in some perverse way , that makes sense			0
but it wo n't make most @entity47 voters any more enthusiastic about re-electing @entity45			1
follow @ @entity240 on @entity241 .			0

today , president @entity45 goes to opening of @entity72
@entity6 was a labor leader who worked for @entity3 migrant farmworkers ' rights
@entity247 : this is a political ploy to *bolster* support from @entity47 voters
@entity247 : @entity6 is *irrelevant* today and his union has ugly history in deportation
