medical marijuana advocates are hoping state governments can succeed where their efforts have failed by asking federal authorities to reclassify pot as a drug with medical use			1
shortly before @entity8 , @entity7 became the fourth state to ask the @entity10 to reclassify marijuana as a narcotic in the same league as heavyweight painkillers including oxycodone			1
the governors of @entity17 and @entity18 filed a formal petition with the agency in november , and @entity21 signed onto that request shortly afterward			2
all four are among the sixteen states and the @entity25 that have laws on the books that allow the medical use of marijuana , even though the drug remains illegal under federal law			1
meanwhile , federal authorities have asserted their power by raiding dispensaries in states including @entity36 and @entity17			1
supporters say the public is on their side , and the state requests show the feds are increasingly isolated on the issue			0
but they acknowledge it 's still an uphill battle			2
" i do n't think that we 're going to see to much change in @entity17 's position on this until public opinion and state - level support reaches a little bit higher a tipping point , " said @entity45 , a spokesman for the @entity25 - based @entity46			1
the @entity10 said it would " reply accordingly , " but noted that similar petitions had been rejected before			0
@entity10 spokeswoman @entity55 told @entity56 that the agency gives " great respect " to state governments , but their requests would get " the same attention as a petition from a medical group or anything else			2
" marijuana is listed as a @entity66 by the @entity10 , meaning it 's dangerous and has no medical use			1
medical marijuana advocates , including the states that have petitioned the agency , say it should be listed under @entity73 , comparing it to other prescription painkillers that have a high potential for abuse			1
in 2006 , the @entity78 restated its opposition to medical marijuana , saying " no sound scientific studies " support its use			1
state laws authorizing it " are inconsistent with efforts to ensure that medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the @entity78 approval process , " it added			0
but in their november petition , @entity17 gov. @entity89 and @entity18 's @entity90 argued that " the vast majority of modern research " has found marijuana useful for treating patients with glaucoma , for relieving the nausea suffered by cancer patients in chemotherapy and for relieving symptoms of degenerative nerve diseases			1
they cite a 2001 study by the @entity105 that recommended research into the " potential therapeutic value " of cannabis , though it warned that smoking pot was a " crude " method " that also delivers harmful substances			2
" " since the last @entity78 review in 2006 , the scientific process has identified and clarified even more of the therapeutic effects of cannabis through ongoing research and assessment of available data , " wrote @entity113 , a @entity114 , and @entity90 , a former @entity115 - turned - independent			0
" this petition presents this further evidence			0
it is now time for the @entity10 to reschedule the substance			0
" the @entity128 administration says it is willing to support research , but has taken a stiff position against medical marijuana			1
in october , in response to online petitions , @entity133 drug czar @entity132 said marijuana " is not a benign drug			2
" medical marijuana group sues @entity128 administration " like many , we are interested in the potential marijuana may have in providing relief to individuals diagnosed with certain serious illnesses			1
that is why we ardently support ongoing research into determining what components of the marijuana plant can be used as medicine , " @entity132 wrote			2
" to date , however , neither the @entity78 nor the @entity151 have found smoked marijuana to meet the modern standard for safe or effective medicine for any condition			2
" @entity55 said petitions to reschedule a drug take years to review			0
the @entity10 does its own analysis , then refers the requests to the @entity78 and the @entity160 , which review their own research			0
" then they send recommendations back to us , and based on the recommendation we get , we make a decision , " she said			0
critics call medical marijuana a " @entity175 " for legalizing the drug entirely , and federal authorities mounted a string of high - profile raids in @entity36 , @entity17 and @entity174 in 2011			1
the @entity177 says it is n't targeting patients who are in " clear and unambiguous compliance " with state laws			0
in october 's raids in @entity36 , prosecutors said they were targeting organizations that had become large - scale commercial traffickers , operating beyond the limits of state law			1
in their petition , @entity113 and @entity90 said rescheduling was needed because states ca n't make rules governing medical marijuana " without putting their employees at risk of violating federal law			1
" " from a patient perspective , there 's a lot of things up in the air , " @entity113 spokesman @entity196 told @entity56			0
he said the state hopes " to give them clarity and peace of mind , both in the environment in which they get it and the prescription and dose they get			0
" a round of federal raids targeted dispensaries in the @entity216 area in november , but agents were targeting " folks who were distributing without a medical purpose , " @entity196 said			2
@entity17 allows patients to grow their own marijuana and keep a 60 - day supply , which it defines as up to 24 ounces			0
patients and designated health - care providers can keep " collective gardens			0
" @entity18 allows patients to grow up to 12 plants and possess up to 2.5 ounces of pot for their own use , as long as a doctor has certified that it may alleviate symptoms and the potential risks do n't outweigh the benefits			2
it also allows " compassion centers " to cultivate and dispense marijuana , as long as it stays within those limits for each patient			0
in @entity7 , legislation passed in 2010 allows state regulators to keep a tight rein on dispensaries and required them to request reclassification from the @entity10			0
" as long as there is a divergence in state and federal law , there is a lack of certainty necessary to provide safe access for patients with serious medical conditions , " @entity247 , the executive director of @entity7 's @entity248 , wrote in a december 22 letter to @entity10 administrator @entity250			1
since the law went into effect , more than 700 people have applied for licenses to sell medical marijuana , said @entity266 , a spokesman for @entity247 's office			1
the state collected about $ 5 million in sales taxes in the last fiscal year , which ended in june -- a tiny fraction of the state 's $ 8 billion general fund , he said			0
@entity45 said the state 's requests to reclassify the drug " could and certainly should " give the states some breathing room , " but i really do n't think it will			1
" " i think that it 's not going to provide any real tangible benefits immediately , " he said			0
but it if succeeds , " it will definitely bring the federal government more in line with currently accepted science			0
" in the meantime , " there 's no reason for the federal government to be wasting resources going after medical marijuana providers , " he said .			1

four states have asked federal officials to reclassify marijuana
governors say they ca n't set rules without risking violations of @entity301 law
advocates say there 's no reason to keep busting medical pot providers
critics call medical marijuana a " @entity175 " for legalization
