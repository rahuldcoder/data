@entity0 -- @entity5 's @entity4 in literature appears to be a nod to the hungry literary tastes in modern @entity8 and could help spark more freedom , activists say			1
the beloved @entity8 author -- whose pen name means " not talking " -- has captivated his countrymen by intertwining fantasy and gritty everyday life			1
the @entity15 awarded @entity16 the prestigious prize thursday , praising the way the author 's " hallucinatory realism merges folk tales , history and the contemporary			1
" @entity16 plies his trade in a country where running afoul of party lines could lead to censorship			1
his work packs a punch but he walks a fine line			0
he is considered a writer within the system and even has embraced official restrictions on writing			0
he 's a @entity36 member and was elected to a vice-chairman spot in the state - sanctioned @entity38			1
state media reported @entity16 's victory immediately after the announcement -- a sharp contrast to @entity8 dissident 's @entity44 's win of the @entity46 two years ago , when international news coverage was blacked out			1
" i think this comes at a really important time for @entity8 literature			1
@entity8 is an extremely literate and energetic society			1
there 's a lot of interesting writing going on now , " said @entity53 of @entity54 -- which promotes literary freedom and free exchange of literature around the world			2
mo , @entity53 said , is one of the most notable writers to come out of a system that 's been " a rigid combination of patronage and censorship			2
" @entity16 has produced compelling literature as he navigated that line , he said , but many in @entity8 think the author has been too " reticent " on some topics			1
@entity53 said the award is " a really good thing for @entity8 literature			1
" " i think in some ways , the award may be recognizing the fact that there 's lively literature happening in @entity8 and i hope this stimulates people to read @entity8 writers , not only @entity5 , " he added			1
@entity83 , executive secretary of the independent @entity84 , said @entity16 is famous for the book on the country 's policy that restricts couples -- with few exceptions -- to having one child			1
@entity83 called @entity16 " one of the most influential " contemporary writers and a " good writer			2
" however , he said , there are better and bolder writers who did n't get a @entity4			0
he said he senses that the award appears to be a recognition of -- or trying to please -- the @entity8 government			1
" i do n't think it 's a very wrong decision to give it to @entity5 , " he said			1
but " we ca n't understand it			0
" however , @entity83 said , now that @entity16 won the prize , maybe he can ask the @entity8 government to free the more than three dozen or so imprisoned writers in the country			1
" he should have this responsibility , " @entity83 said			0
@entity16 was born in @entity108 in @entity109 into a family of farmers in 1955 as @entity5			1
he joined the @entity112 as a young man and began his career , becoming , according to literary magazine @entity115 , one of the country 's " most celebrated and widely translated writers			2
" " he 's an earnest and pragmatic person , " his brother said , according to news reports before the award was announced			2
" i hope he will continue writing earnestly and create more literary work enjoyed by the masses			2
" @entity16 told local media in 2003 that his pen name is a word play on his original middle name , but also a reminder to himself that he should talk less and write more			2
the author sets his novels in a community based on his hometown			0
@entity115 asked him in a recent interview if he has been influenced by other writers , such as @entity138 novelist @entity137 , who set many of his stories in one specific fictional county in @entity142			0
" when i first started writing it was the year of 1981 , so i did n't read any books by @entity143 or @entity137 , " he said , referring to @entity144 novelist @entity143			0
" it was 1984 when i first read their works and undoubtedly those two writers have great influence on my creations			0
i found that my life experience is quite similar to theirs , but i only discovered this later on			0
if i had read their works sooner i would have already accomplished a masterpiece like they did			0
" his novel " frog " explores @entity8 's one - child policy , designed for population control			1
he poignantly explored the traditional @entity8 preference for boys over girls , which stems from the perception that boys are more able to provide for the family and carry on the family line			1
that tendency has fed the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls , which continues today in rural parts of @entity8			1
" frog traces the life of a midwife who witnesses forced late - term abortions , forced sterilization and other horrors , and it does so whimsically â € ” in the form of four letters and a play			2
the midwife 's struggle to reconcile her conflicting loyalties to party , family and patients forms the backbone of the narrative , which @entity5 says had been percolating in his head since the early 1980s , " a @entity188 story said			1

he also is famous for his novels " @entity206 , " a story that takes place during the @entity211 occupation of @entity8 during @entity212 , and " @entity213 , " described as an epic about women			2
he was asked by @entity115 if he considers himself a feminist or if he is " simply drawn to write from a female perspective			0
" " first of all , i admire and respect women			0
i think they are very noble and their life experience and the hardship a woman can endure is always much greater than a man			0
when we encounter great disasters , women are always more brave than men -- i think because they have their due capacity , they are also mothers			0
" the strength that this brings is something we ca n't imagine			0
in my books i try to put myself in the shoes of women , i try to understand and interpret this world from the perspective of women			0
but the bottom line is i am not a woman : i 'm a male writer			0
and the world i interpreted in my books as if i were a woman , might not be well received by women themselves but that is not something i can do anything about			0
i love and admire women , but nonetheless i am a man , " he said			0
@entity16 told @entity188 that he does n't worry about censorship when deciding what to write			2
he told the magazine that the " inability to attack some topics head on is actually an advantage			0
" " there are certain restrictions on writing in every country , " he said			0
" one of the biggest problems in literature is the lack of subtlety			0
a writer should bury his thoughts deep and convey them through the characters in his novel			0
" " by placing much of his writing in the past , and through the adroit subtlety of his magic - realist style , @entity5 avoids stirring up the animosity of the country 's ever vigilant censors any more than he needs to , " the @entity188 interview said			1
after the award was announced , @entity8 national pride rippled across the @entity275			1
" @entity8 , " one commenter said on the @entity4 website , " is rising			2
" mo himself " was overjoyed and scared , " @entity8 state media reported , citing a @entity280 member who informed the author of the prize			2
@entity8 authorities and many @entity8 people regard @entity16 as the first to win the literature prize			1
the prize in 2000 went to @entity8 writer @entity288 , who was born and educated in @entity8 but is now a @entity290 citizen			2
