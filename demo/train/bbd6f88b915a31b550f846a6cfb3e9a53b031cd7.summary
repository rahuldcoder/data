-- @entity1 is getting into the game - making game			1
the @entity5 - based company announced its first major social - game title , " @entity7 , " on monday			1
the free @entity9 game is the first from its @entity11 , a new department at the e-commerce giant that was also unveiled monday			1
" @entity11 is exactly what it sounds like : a new team at @entity1 that 's focused on creating innovative , fun and well - crafted games , " said the company in a blog post on the new games.amazon.com site			2
the department is currently hiring , but few other details are given			0
the social - gaming field is still dominated by @entity21 , maker of addictive games such as @entity23 and @entity24 and their various spin - offs			2
but the company has been struggling since going public in december ; @entity21 's stock closed at $ 2.94 a share on monday			2
yet another social game is n't much of a threat to @entity21 , but @entity1 has the firepower necessary to become a legitimate competitor , thanks to its large network of customers with active accounts			1
@entity1 can also target any games it does build to users of its popular @entity40 tablets			0
@entity1 is n't revealing much about its motivation for entering the game market , saying only , " we know that many @entity1 customers enjoy playing games -- including free - to - play social games -- and thanks to @entity1 's know - how , we believe we can deliver a great , accessible gaming experience that gamers and our customers can play any time			1
" the first game is a simple literature - themed puzzle game			1
players are presented with busy illustrations of scenes loosely based on classic books			0
to get points called cash and coins , they must quickly spot and click moving objects on the screen			1
levels include takes on " @entity66 , " " @entity67 , " " @entity68 " and more generic themes such as pirates and haunted houses			0
( " classics " could mean more than just books -- one of the illustrations on the official @entity9 fan page show two x-files type characters			0
) since this is a @entity9 game , there are plenty of opportunities to play the game with friends			2
and since games are big business , there are options to spend real money on in - app purchases			0
players can stock up on game currency -- a dollar buys you five units of " cash " currency , and $ 100 gets you 660			0
however the feature does n't appear to be working at this time .			0
