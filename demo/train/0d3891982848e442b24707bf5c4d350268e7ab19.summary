the @entity0 on monday dismissed a long - standing appeal from scientists who tried to block funding of stem cell research on human embryos			1
the brief order from the justices is a victory for supporters of federally funded testing to combat a range of diseases and illnesses			0
federal courts had previously lifted an injunction on continued funding , and this latest high court action probably means the lawsuits will be ultimately dismissed			0
the field of embryonic stem cell research has been highly controversial , because in most cases , the research process involves destroying the embryo , typically four or five days old , after removing stem cells			1
these cells are blank and can become any cell in the body			0
because of the destruction of embryos , most opponents believe this is a moral issue			0
supporters of the research point to the potential for saving lives			0
legislation passed in 1996 prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in the creation or destruction of human embryos " for research purposes			2
" private money had been used to gather batches of the developing cells at @entity47 - run labs			0
that congressional ban had been renewed annually			0
stem cells vs. heart attacks the current administration had broken with the @entity52 and issued rules in 2009 permitting those cells to be reproduced in controlled conditions and for work on them to move forward			2
@entity59 administration officials have been at odds with many members of @entity62 over whether the @entity64 research causes an embryo 's destruction , as prohibited by the @entity67			0
in opposing the lawsuit , the government had argued that an extensive list of research projects outlined by the government health research agency would have to be shelved if the courts blocked further funding			0
some scientists say that embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body			1
in 2011 , the @entity82 lifted an injunction originally issued by a federal judge , who said , at the time , that all embryonic stem cell research at the research agency amounted to the destruction of embryos , in violation of congressional spending laws			1
the appeals panel later reversed , concluding the plaintiffs bringing suit " are unlikely to prevail because @entity95 is ambiguous and the @entity64 seems reasonably to have concluded " that the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells			1
stem cells help deaf gerbils hear the @entity52 at the time applauded that ruling			2
" while we do n't know exactly what stem cell research will yield , scientists believe this research could treat or cure diseases that affect millions of @entity47 every year , " said @entity103 , a deputy senior advisor to the president			1
" that 's why president @entity59 has long fought to support responsible stem cell research			2
" the case began with a lawsuit against the @entity64 by @entity115 and @entity116 , scientists opposed to the use of embryonic stem cells , who worked with a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization , including the nonprofit @entity125			1
embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research , which do not require embryos			1
the current case does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells , which is permissible under federal law			2
in 2001 , when president @entity136 first approved federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research , 64 existing stem cell lines that were created before august 9 , 2001 , qualified for federal funding			1
but of those , only 21 were usable by scientists			0
@entity136 later rescinded the funding			0
under the @entity59 administration 's rules , at least 75 stem cell lines qualify for federal funding , according to the @entity64			1
the @entity64 has invested more than $ 500 million in human embryonic stem cell research			1
scientists conducting such research say continued federal funding is necessary , because they would have greater flexibility to work collaboratively within labs , across labs and around the world on the latest treatments and breakthroughs			2
supporters of embryonic stem cell research say their studies have shown promise in treating a range of debilitating conditions , including diabetes , parkinson 's disease , cancer and spinal cord injuries			1
the case is @entity115 v. @entity167 ( 12 - 454 ) .			0

@entity0 dismisses appeal that tried to block funding of stem cell research on human embryos
scientists had sued the @entity64 over the use of embryonic stem cells
opponents of human embryonic stem cell research cite moral issues
supporters say federal funding will help research ways to fight a range of illnesses
