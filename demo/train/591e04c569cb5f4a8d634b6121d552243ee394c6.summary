one of the oddest features in the new @entity2 tablets is decidedly retro : a button that summons a human tech support representative on your screen			1
when you press the @entity10 button on a @entity11 , a small box appears on the tablet			1
in the box is live video of a friendly @entity15 customer support person			1
you can slide his or her face around your screen so it 's not blocking any key buttons or settings , and then ask away			1
" how do i set up my e-mail account ? " a new @entity2 owner might wonder			0
the representative can see , control and draw little arrows and lines on the screen			1
" first , open this mail app , " they 'll say while a bright orange arrow appears on on you screen pointing to the mail app. if you 'd rather they just take over , they can navigate and press the buttons for you , all while you watch it happen ( and admire the look of concentration on the rep 's face ) in real time			2
more on the new @entity2 fires offering up a live human is the exact opposite of what many tech companies are doing for tech support			1
in addition to directing people to online help forums and detailed help documents , some major companies such as @entity49 are using automated online assistants			0
the programs show an illustration of a friendly face on your screen and use artificial intelligence to mimic a real customer service interaction			2
humans are still present at 800 numbers ( after you navigate a maze of automate options that thin out the herd ) , and on the other end of live chat support , but typically they ca n't see your screen without jumping through some hoops , and there 's no face - to - face interaction			1
" what we wanted to do was to elevate that tech support customer experience by bringing a tech support person ... directly on your screen and giving them the ability to see what you 're doing , " said @entity15 ceo @entity72 at a demo of the feature in @entity75			1
more than being able to see someone 's face , having a representative automatically see and control your screen is the best way to provide customer support			1
( after years of long , arduous phone calls talking my mom through computer problems , i finally set it up so i could control her screen from across the country and fix any problems myself			1
it was the best idea i 've ever had			0
) " tech support is very difficult to do over the phone , " said @entity72			1
first the customer has to describe the problem and what they 're seeing			0
then the representative has to describe what they 're supposed to do to fix it			2
the potential for miscommunication and confusion is great			0
because it 's easier , screen sharing will greatly cut down on the amount of time it takes to solve a problem			1
so while there will likely be many more requests for help using @entity10 than an 800 number , the time savings could even out			0
at least at first , the feature will be ripe for some fun , unorthodox uses			2
lonely people might just dial up a rep to chat , ask about their favorite movies and ask about their day			0
luckily the video connection is only one way and they can not see the customer , only their screen			2
@entity15 is n't afraid of the goofy people			0
" i expect in the early days , we 'll see lots of people using this feature just to try it out , just to show it off to their friends , and that 's great			2
we 're excited about that			0
we want that to happen , " said @entity72			0
the tech support representatives are trained to be extra friendly and accommodating			1
for example , customers are encouraged to ask them about movie or app recommendations			0
in the battle of @entity152 versus @entity153 , @entity150 products are given credit as easier to learn and use while @entity153 tablets and phones offer more customization and control			1
even though the @entity2 runs a highly customized , nearly unrecognizable version of the @entity162 mobile operating system , it appears to be aiming for a more @entity150 - like ease of use			2
the company has always prided itself on providing very good customer service , and previously , @entity2 owners could call a representative 24 hours a day at an 800 number			1
to start , @entity10 will use the same customer service representatives already in place around the world but give them the new technology and training			0
if it takes off , @entity15 will bring in more people			0
the cost of the staff , training and technology required to provide instant access to a live person 24 hours a day , seven days a week must be sizable			2
but like the @entity2 hardware itself , @entity15 does is not trying to make money off it			0
the goal is to make it easier for people to use the tablet			1
the more they use it , the more time they will spend in the @entity15 ecosystem , and the more money they will spend on @entity15 content and products			0
happy customers equal more profit .			0
