-- ten years after " @entity5 " became a bestseller , authors @entity1 and @entity3 have released back - to - back new books			1
a lot has changed in the publishing industry , not to mention in the authors ' personal lives , between the bookends of their careers thus far			1
" @entity18 " is a young adult novel about a teenager who helps friends cope with breakups , while struggling to move on from her own heartbreak			1
and " between @entity23 " depicts a famous singer 's public self - destruction , in a story reminiscent of recent real - life celebrity dramas			1
it 's been a busy decade for @entity1 and @entity3 , both 38			1
" @entity5 , " their satirical novel about a young woman who looks after the offspring of spoiled @entity30 parents , sold four million copies			1
it spawned a sequel ( " the nanny returns " ) and a feature film			2
@entity1 and @entity3 also wrote " citizen girl , " " dedication , " and their young adult debut , " @entity41 , " in addition to various short stories			1
but their prolific writing career is n't their only priority these days			1
the two former nannies recently became mothers : @entity1 's son , @entity48 , and @entity3 's daughter , @entity49 , are both 2 years old			1
the authors live in @entity51 , where i went to high school with @entity3			1
the new mothers talked to @entity0 over the phone about their transition from writers , to working moms , who are also adapting to a shift in the literary landscape			0
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : how has becoming mothers impacted your writing ? @entity3 : we 're definitely more efficient than we 've ever been before , because we have to be			1
we no longer have those sweet spot , post-sugar crash , 5 to 8 p.m. hours to make up whatever we have n't gotten done during the day			0
we have a hard clock - out because we have to be at pickup			1
we have to do the parts of the day that we love : dinner , bath time and bedtime			0
and sometimes we get back to work after our kids go to bed , but we 're usually really brain - fried by then , in a way that we did n't used to be			1
@entity1 : we 're a lot less precious about getting to work			1
we 're not getting that perfect cup of tea , and waiting until the morning light is just so , and finding just the right inspiration			0
it 's butt in the chair , when you get the kids settled , and you just go			1
the upside of that for our writing creatively is that you 're in a constant state of thinking about the novel			1
your brain is constantly firing on problem solving			0
are the characters working ? all those hard questions that you have to put the material through are ever - present now			2
@entity0 : would you say that becoming mothers around the same time brought you closer together as a writing team ? @entity3 : definitely			1
i ca n't imagine what it would have been like if it had been one of us years apart from the other			2
because i think you ca n't appreciate how tired you are , or how much willpower you have to harness on some days to focus , until you 've done it			0
it really is like nothing else			0
and i think that we have a lot of compassion for each other			0
we understand what it is when the other has been up all night with their children , if someone has the flu or something			2
i think it 's impossible if you have n't had kids yet to really get that			2
@entity1 : becoming a parent is such an extreme change in your life			1
i think it 's invaluable to your sanity to have somebody who understands it and is going through it with you			2
just on an individual level , regardless of the work , on a personal level , it 's priceless to have that support from somebody who gets it			2
you do n't have to explain yourself in that way			0
it 's just really comforting			2
@entity0 : you have two new books out , in different genres			2
has motherhood helped you to write something that you would n't have been able to before ? @entity3 : it 's funny			1
we look back at books that we 've finished with a different lens than we have before			1
specifically , we talked a lot about " @entity5 " in the last couple of years because when we were nannies , we could n't really understand why so much derision and scorn was thrown the way of not just us , but our colleagues			1
and now that we 're parents , and we 're so dependent on having fantastic caregivers , so that we can step away and do things that we need to do , we 're even more mind - boggled by it than we were before			2
we are so appreciative of the women who come in and make our kids ' days awesome			0
and we love that our kids love these women			0
we appreciate the affection that these women give our children , and the structure , and the education and the discipline			2
and it means the world to us			0
@entity0 : did you ever consider not coming back to work after your children were born , or was it agreed that you definitely would ? @entity3 : speaking for myself , i was counting the days until my daughter was old enough to start daycare			1
they have a 3 - month - ( old ) policy			2
and i am so grateful that i have a career that i am deeply committed to and that brings me so much joy			0
and it makes me a happy person , which i think makes me a happy mom			0
i am so psyched when i get to pickup at 5:30			0
and i try to make those hours with her as fun as possible because i 've had a good day			0
even the tough days are good days			0
and i am grateful to have both in my life			0
@entity1 : i agree to all of that and i think , additionally , it was interesting for me to discover the moments i 've had of : ' i should just be doing this ; i should just be parenting ' have not come ever from not wanting to be working or a lack of passion to be working			1
it comes from moments where there are n't enough hours in the day			0
it 's wishing i had more time to do both			2
i feel really blessed to be able to go to work every day			0
i have no question that it makes me a better parent			0
it fulfills me so much that i am able to be so much more present with my son			0
@entity0 : do your kids play together ? @entity3 : not as often as we would like ! @entity1 : but when they do , they are quite enchanted with each other			1
@entity3 : it was so cute			1
they kissed each other on the lips goodbye at @entity220			0
@entity0 : you 're collaborating with @entity223 and @entity224 on " breakup to beautiful " makeovers at @entity228 stores			0
did you approach them ? or did they come to you ? @entity3 : this was @entity1 's brainchild			1
@entity1 : we reached out			1
the landscape of publishing is rapidly shifting			0
it 's a very unstable time for an author			2
i think we 've been doing a lot of thinking about how we can continue to be out there when we 've lost so much marketing via foot traffic of brick and mortar stores , and the consolidation of retailers			0
that was so much of how novelists depended upon connecting with readers			0
so we have been doing a lot of thinking outside of the box about how to do that			0
@entity1 and @entity3 are signing copies of " @entity18 " at @entity224 counters in various @entity228 stores through december 1 .			1

it 's been 10 years since @entity1 , @entity3 wrote " @entity5 "
*co-authors* recently released back - to - back books , one a young adult novel , " @entity260 "
the pair , who *typically* write together , both gave birth to their first children two years *ago*
changing lives have meant their writing methods , points of view have changed as well
