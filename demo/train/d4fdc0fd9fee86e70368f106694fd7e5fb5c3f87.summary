-- he 's tweaked defense attorneys that potential jurors should be brought in from homeless shelters to boost diversity , sternly chastised lawyers for talking over one another , and pushed against having jury members continually shuttled in and out " like a @entity9			0
" in the weeks and months leading to @entity13 's murder trial , @entity11 superior court chief judge @entity10 has proven colorful , quick and -- above all -- in command			1
" i know what is relevant , " he said earlier this spring , in proceedings leading up to tuesday 's opening arguments			0
" i have never been shy in not speaking up			0
" after swearing in a 12 - member jury and five alternates early friday evening , which followed an 11 - day selection process in @entity23 -- the off - site location mandated by the judge , in hopes of drawing from more people who were n't biased by intense media coverage -- the 61 - year - old will return next week to his native @entity30 to preside over @entity32 's trial			1
@entity10 will then , as he has in his past 21 years as a judge , keep attorneys in line , resolve legal issues quickly and help jurors develop a clear understanding of the law and this specific case			1
that jury will decide whether to convict or acquit @entity32 on aggravated child abuse , aggravated manslaughter , misleading law enforcement and capital murder -- a charge that , if there is a conviction , could lead to a death sentence			1
yet , while he has been an institution in central @entity53 legal circles for years , this trial marks @entity10 's coming - out party for many around the country			1
already in the @entity32 case , he has dealt with his share of testy , controversial and complicated matters , often while flashing his quick wit and easy grin			2
" judge @entity10 is a good judge , " a veteran @entity53 attorney @entity62 , who had represented @entity13 's parents , told @entity0 last year			1
" he knows the law			0
" in a sense , he was born into the law			0
his father , @entity10 , and another man -- @entity69 -- were the first two @entity71 officers hired , in january 1951 , by the @entity30 police			1
at that time , @entity53 was still segregated			0
yet the elder @entity10 remained on the job , becoming the city 's first black plainclothes detective , according to the police department			1
he was still on patrol when he retired in 1976 , dying 19 years later			0
" a lot of pressure was on those two men , because if they failed , someone would have said they told them so , " @entity10 said in a july 2010 ceremony unveiling statues of the elder @entity10 and @entity69 , as shown in a video on the @entity30 police department 's website			1
" without trailblazers , there would be no path for us to travel today			0
" @entity10 never graduated from high school , according to a feature obituary in the @entity94 , yet he fathered five children who went onto become a school principal , store owner , surgeon , lawyer and judge			1
later , @entity10 credited his father with helping shape his patient , engaging style from the bench -- especially the importance of listening to others and carefully processing information first before coming to a decision			1
" always wait until you hear everything before you come up with a conclusion -- particularly before you open your mouth , " the son told @entity0 affiliate @entity110			0
still , the younger @entity10 was not always destined to be a judge			1
after earning his bachelor 's degree in history from @entity118 in 1972 , @entity10 spent another two years at the @entity120 school getting his master 's in education			1
it was then that he moved onto @entity124 for his third degree -- in law -- at the @entity127			0
the @entity30 native established his bonafides early as a prosecutor in @entity53 's ninth circuit			1
in 1989 , he moved behind the bench by becoming a circuit judge in @entity134			0
by 1992 , he 'd moved back to @entity11 and -- three years later -- was tapped as chief judge			1
in 2011 , judges on the @entity53 's ninth circuit again unanimously voted @entity10 to an eighth term in that post			2
that puts him in charge of 65 judges in @entity11 and @entity134 counties through at least 2013			2
in his time on the bench , @entity10 has presided over numerous murder trials and high - profiles cases			2
in 2002 , for instance , he ruled against prosecutors when he refused to compel employees of a drug treatment center to testify about an incident in which then - @entity53 gov. @entity154 's daughter , @entity153 , was allegedly found to have a small amount of crack cocaine			2
more recently , he ruled against defense attorneys ' in their bid to restrict the media 's coverage during the @entity13 trial			1
" we do n't live in @entity163			0
we do n't live in @entity164 , " @entity10 said			2
" there 's a thing called the @entity167			0
whether we like it or not , it 's in the @entity170			0
" yet despite his preeminent legal standing in @entity173 -- where , police say , @entity32 killed her two - year - old daughter @entity13 , put the girl 's body in her trunk and disposed of it , then misled investigators -- @entity10 initially was not supposed to be on the case			1
he came on in april 2010 , after judge @entity182 stepped down after the defense accused him of being a " self - aggrandizing media hound " who is biased against @entity32			1
in recent months , defense attorneys have raised various objections -- which @entity10 , for the most part has overruled -- calling for a slower pace to the case , asking the judge to exclude certain evidence and challenging the diversity of the jury pool			2
yet compared to the atmosphere with @entity182 , there have been no personal barbs or accusations that @entity10 is doing anything but trying to adhere to the law , as he sees it			2
this is not surprising , according to lawyers quoted in several media reports around @entity53 and others , who say @entity10 can be counted on to be timely , deliberative and fair			2
" he 's going to make a conscious , well - developed legal decision in good faith based on what he 's heard , one way or another , " @entity207 , a @entity53 lawyer , told @entity110			0
@entity62 recalled , during his first appearance before @entity10 years ago , being invited into chambers and being given two rules : " one , the train leaves at 8:30 a.m. be on it			0
" @entity62 said that @entity10 assured him , " if you follow those two rules , you 'll be fine			0
" watch @entity219 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity220			0
