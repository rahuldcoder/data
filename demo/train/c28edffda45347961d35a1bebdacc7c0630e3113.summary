@entity0 -- in his highly anticipated counterterrorism speech last month , @entity3 president @entity2 publicly acknowledged -- for the first time -- the human toll that drone attacks inflict on @entity9 civilians			1
" it is a hard fact that @entity3 strikes have resulted in civilian casualties , " he admitted , adding , " these deaths will haunt us			1
" while he pledged to curtail the use of drone strikes in the future , those words rang hollow when he went on to reaffirm his commitment to the targeted killings because , in his view , any alternative would invite far more civilian casualties			1
@entity2 's drone calculus ignores the @entity26 's warning about the continuing " possibilities of blowback			1
" officials in @entity30 ignore the high - cost ways in which the @entity3 " war on terror " and the use of tactics such as drone strikes fuel the fires of home - grown radicalization in @entity40 societies			1
this is a rising phenomenon that has not been seriously debated , despite a string of high - profile attacks			1
while trials have yet to take place , the @entity49 attack in @entity0 and the @entity50 bombings are suspected to be the latest cases in point			0
in case after case over the past few years , attackers and would - be attackers have cited the war on terror , first in @entity59 and now in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and elsewhere as proof that the @entity65 is at war with @entity67			1
the presence of @entity40 boots in @entity9 lands and the continuing use of drone strikes have triggered a backlash among scores of deluded young @entity75 who live in @entity3 and @entity76 , and who come from different educational and class background , including high achievers			1
what is surprising is that these attackers are not unified by a core set of ideological beliefs , or a belonging to a particular terrorist group , but by a core set of grievances , real or imagined			1
these are a different set of terrorists , in that they radicalized themselves -- enraged by specific grievances , while also having been integrated into life in western society			1
falling under the influence of militant preachers mostly online , they have internalized the kind of religious - political worldview that justified their taking matters into their own hands -- in short , a license to kill			2
instead of trying to dismiss how the manner in which the @entity3 " war on terror " has been waged has motivated these angry , deluded young men to kill , it behooves us to take stock of their voices and to understand the drivers behind this pattern of violent rage			1
the goal is not to rationalize or justify their murders but to make sense of their violent actions			0
@entity50 bombing suspect @entity121 , for example , allegedly left a note claiming responsibility for the april attack , describing it as retribution for @entity3 wars in @entity60 and @entity59			2
the purported message was handwritten on the interior wall of the boat where he hid from authorities , bleeding from gunshot wounds			0
in the note , @entity121 is said to have described the bombing victims as " collateral damage " : " when you attack one @entity9 , you attack all @entity75 , " @entity121 wrote			2
he described his brother @entity137 , who died in a shootout with police , as a martyr			0
and after his @entity142 bombing attempt , @entity143 -- who held a master 's degree in business administration and who seemed fully integrated into @entity3 life - reportedly told investigators that he acted out of anger over the @entity26 's predator strikes in @entity61 , especially a drone attack that took place while he was visiting the country			1
asked later by @entity3 district judge @entity156 whether he was sure he wanted to plead guilty , @entity143 replied that he wanted " to plead guilty 100 times because unless the @entity3 pulls out of @entity60 and @entity59 , until they stop drone strikes in @entity63 , @entity61 and @entity62 and stop attacking @entity9 lands , we will attack the @entity3 and be out to get them			1
" pressed by the judge to explain his motivations , @entity143 answered : " i consider myself a @entity163 and a @entity9 soldier , " he said			2
asked by @entity165 whether he understood that children and other innocents might have been among his victims , @entity143 was unapologetic			0
" they do n't see the drones killing children in @entity60 , " he said			0
" it 's a war and i 'm a part of it			0
" @entity143 is not unique			0
@entity175 , who pleaded guilty to plotting to detonate a bomb in the @entity177 , is also an example of bottom - up radicalization			2
like @entity143 , @entity175 told the court that in august 2008 he decided to go with friends to @entity61 to join the @entity182 in fighting the @entity3 ' invasion of @entity60			2
he went to the @entity182 , not the other way around , and while in @entity61 he was persuaded by @entity186 operatives to return to @entity3 to be a suicide bomber			2
" i would sacrifice myself to bring attention to what the @entity3 was doing to civilians in @entity60 by sacrificing my soul for the sake of saving their souls , " @entity175 told the court			2
likewise , the @entity61 - born suspect charged in an alleged plot to blow up the @entity30 subway system in october 2010 came to the @entity200 's attention because he had asked people about ways to fight @entity3 troops in @entity60 and @entity61 , according to unsealed court records			1
@entity205 , a 34 - year - old naturalized @entity3 citizen , reportedly hoped to journey to his native country and to fight there			1
the @entity182 and @entity186 did not recruit him			0
@entity205 , an engineer with a bachelor 's degree from the @entity209 , was supposedly radicalized by the conflict in @entity60 - @entity61			0
his ultimate goal , according to an @entity200 affidavit , was " traveling to @entity60 to fight and kill @entity3			2
" similarly , the @entity214 suicide bomber , @entity215 , who blew himself up in @entity216 , studied in @entity217 and was married with three children			0
@entity220 's friends paint a picture of man who enjoyed basketball and a good party , yet who had become increasingly angry over the past few years			0
his @entity227 wall posts give a hint of his gradual radicalization			0
one shows a blindfolded @entity59 man being taunted and abused by @entity3 soldiers			2
several more are part of a series on " @entity236 war crimes in @entity237			0
" according to the @entity239 , @entity238 sent an audio recording to @entity214 authorities minutes before the explosions warning his actions would " speak for themselves			0
" " now , your children -- daughters and sisters -- will die like our brothers and sisters and children die , " the @entity239 reported			0
" as long as you do not end your war against @entity67 and the insult against the prophet and your stupid support for that pig @entity256 " ( @entity214 has about 500 signals intelligence specialists in the @entity260 force in @entity60 )			0
as a round - up of these violent voices show , home - grown extremism is a phenomenon driven by identity politics , a blowback against what they see as the @entity3 " war on terror " in @entity9 countries , a war that kills more civilians than @entity186 operators			1
in this sense , the fight disproportionately inflames anti-western sentiments and creates more terrorists at home			0
according to a 2006 @entity280 poll , the @entity3 " @entity284 " is very unpopular among @entity75 in @entity76 , with 83 % of @entity75 in @entity281 opposed , 78 % in @entity282 , 77 % in @entity217 , and 62 % in @entity283			2
three years later , a survey of @entity75 for the @entity286 showed that 75 % said it was wrong for the " @entity65 " to intervene militarily in @entity61 and @entity60 , though a majority of respondents -- 78 % -- said they opposed @entity182 attacks against @entity40 troops there			0
in his national security address , @entity2 hinted that the @entity3 might begin to bring a closure to the " war on terror "			1
with @entity186 's core now " on the path to defeat , " he argued , " this war , like all wars , must end			0
" although @entity2 did not go far enough by suspending drone strikes , his scaling back of the targeted killing and recommitting to closing the prison at @entity301 , @entity302 , are steps in the right direction			1
the importance of @entity2 's speech lies in educating the nation about the diminishing terrorist threat			0
one would hope that the president would level with @entity3 about the limits and costs of force in international affairs			1
terrorism can not be eradicated by pushing a button , as in drone attacks , or even military intervention that might cause a backlash that spurs more , not less , terrorism			1
deescalating the " war on terror " by halting the questionable use of tactics such as drone attacks might not bring an end to home - grown radicalization			1
but it could go a long way to deactivating the cultural and religious minefields that entrap disillusioned @entity9 teens and spur some of them down a violent path			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity335 .			0

president @entity2 acknowledged -- for first time -- human toll of drone attacks
@entity335 : @entity3 " war on terror " and drone strikes fuel home - grown radicalization
recent attackers unified not by ideology , but core grievances , real or imagined - @entity350
deescalating " war on terror , he says , could remove sources of disillusionment for @entity9 teens
