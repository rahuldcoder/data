-- @entity2 's besieged leader says he regrets that his soldiers shot down a @entity5 jet last month but said they thought the plane belonged to @entity7			1
" i would not wish it for any plane other than an enemy one			0
especially for a @entity5 plane , i say 100 % , if only we did not shoot it down , " president @entity11 told @entity5 's @entity13 newspaper in an interview published tuesday			1
" the @entity5 people are our brothers and something that would make them sad would never make me happy and it did not			1
if this was an @entity7 plane , of course , i would have been happy			1
" the june 22 shootdown of the @entity25 jet came after @entity7 planes had previously used the same air corridor three times , @entity11 said			1
@entity7 and @entity2 are longtime adversaries			1
" a plane coming from that side is perceived by the @entity2 military as an @entity7 plane			1
it was accepted as an enemy plane , reacted against fast and fired at , " he said			0
" since we could n't see it on our radars and no information was given either , the soldiers downed it			2
we learned that it belonged to @entity5 after shooting it down			2
" as a result , @entity11 said , the significance of the downing " should not be exaggerated			2
" the shootdown underscores rising tensions between the two nations over @entity2 's nearly 16 - month government crackdown and the grass - roots uprising against the regime			0
@entity2 and @entity5 have acknowledged that the plane strayed into @entity2 airspace , but @entity5 said the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected			2
@entity5 's @entity57 has bolstered its forces along the border and said last week the nation would act against any " hostile action " by @entity2			1
@entity5 prime minister @entity62 said his country was changing its rules of engagement and would treat any military approach by @entity2 forces toward its border as a threat that " will be dealt with accordingly			1
" @entity70 deplored the shootdown , but the alliance , of which @entity5 is a member , did not promise any action in response to the incident			2
@entity5 officials said tuesday that they scrambled jet fighters monday to track @entity2 helicopters flying near the border between the two countries			1
it was the third consecutive day in which @entity5 officials have sent jets to intercept @entity2 helicopters closing in on the border , the @entity5 armed forces said			2
the search for the downed jet 's wreckage and pilots was ongoing			1
the @entity5 government , once close with @entity11 , has been sharply critical of the @entity2 leader 's clampdown against his citizens			1
@entity5 is hosting thousands of @entity2 refugees and @entity97 opposition groups			1
@entity98 criticized @entity62 's " dangerous " posturing after what he said was an understandable military move			1
" in an environment like this , arrival of such a plane is naturally perceived as an enemy plane , " he said			0
" anyone who understands military matters a bit would know this			0
a country at war would behave this way anywhere in the world			0
this is absolutely not a political decision			0
however , unfortunately , the @entity62 government is after narrow calculations using this incident			0
he has n't gotten the @entity5 people 's support for 15 months about the @entity2 policy			1
now , he wants to use this incident as an opportunity to turn the animosity between governments to animosity between the people			0
" despite the tensions , @entity11 draws a distinction between the @entity5 government and @entity7 , its longtime adversary			1
he said he does n't see @entity5 as an enemy			2
@entity98 criticized @entity5 for cutting off ties between its army and @entity2 's			1
that hurt communication after the downing , he said			0
" we would have handled the matter between military officials , " he said			0
" however , in the recent months we do not even have a telephone number anymore of a @entity5 commander to call in case of an emergency			2
" asked under what conditions he would leave his position , @entity11 said , " if millions of people in my country do n't want me , of course i would go			2
why would i sit where i am not wanted ? " a report published by @entity154 accused the @entity2 regime of carrying out " a state policy of torture " to crush dissent			0
the group , citing interviews with more than 200 former prisoners and security officers who defected , identified 27 detention centers across @entity2 where prisoners were tortured			0
the carnage has spiked in recent days , with at least 109 people killed sunday and 114 people killed monday , opposition activists said			0
at least 71 deaths were recorded tuesday , the opposition @entity169 said			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because @entity2 restricts access by international journalists			0
@entity98 's forces are showing signs of fracture , with reports of defections growing			1
at least 258 people , including soldiers , officers and their relatives fled monday , said col. @entity185 , deputy commander of the rebel @entity186			0
he said it was not certain how many were soldiers and how many were relatives			0
as violence raged , diplomats and dissidents continued to search for ways to resolve the problem			0
opposition groups have been meeting in @entity196 , @entity197 , in an attempt to unify their platform			0
world powers huddled saturday in @entity201 , @entity202 , in an attempt to devise steps to end the crisis			0
@entity206 , spokesman for @entity207 , the @entity208 and @entity209 joint special envoy to @entity2 , called the meeting " an accomplishment , " with all parties coming together to agree on the need for a transitional governing body in @entity2			1
speaking to reporters tuesday , he said @entity222 and @entity223 , which have pushed back on tough world action against @entity11 's regime , " will put their full backing behind this agreement and do whatever they can do			1
" " we are appealing to the parties to take a deep breath and step back from the brink and look long and hard at the proposals on the table because they form a framework for a solution , " he said			0
the group in @entity202 agreed that both the regime and opposition fighters should immediately observe a cease - fire and implement @entity207 's six - point peace plan without waiting for the actions of others			1
the transitional government could include members of the current @entity2 regime , making it theoretically possible that @entity11 could be be a part of any transition			2
@entity207 pointed out that the @entity2 will decide the makeup			2
@entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
