@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 announced what he called a " landmark " trade agreement with @entity6 on saturday that he said will increase @entity3 exports by $ 11 billion and support 70,000 @entity3 jobs			1
the agreement would eliminate tariffs on over 95 % of industrial and consumer goods within five years			0
" it 's a win - win for both countries , " @entity2 said			1
" it will contribute significantly to my goal of doubling @entity3 exports over the next five years , " he said			1
" in fact , it 's estimated that today 's deal alone will increase @entity3 economic output by more than our last nine free trade agreements combined			1
" @entity2 made the announcement just after the @entity24 rejected @entity2 's proposal to extend the @entity27 - era tax cuts to everyone but the wealthiest @entity3			2
@entity2 said he was disappointed by the tax vote but looked forward to @entity30 ratifying the trade pact " because if there 's one thing @entity32 and @entity33 should be able to agree on , it should be creating jobs and opportunity for our people			0
" the trade agreement would strengthen economic ties between @entity0 and @entity42 at a time when the longtime @entity3 ally faces an increasingly hostile northern neighbor the first version of the agreement was negotiated in 2007 by the @entity27 administration , but foundered in @entity30			2
the new accord comes just weeks after negotiators failed to reach a deal at the @entity52 , forcing @entity2 to walk away from the conference without an agreement			0
a long - running dispute over @entity3 access to @entity6 's auto and beef markets was largely responsible for the failure of the earlier agreement			1
but those issues have since been resolved			0
the new agreement calls for @entity6 to reduce its tariff on @entity3 auto imports from 8 % to 4 % , and fully eliminate it in five years			1
meanwhile , the 2.5 % @entity3 tariff on auto imports will remain in place until the fifth year , instead of being immediately eliminated as specified in the 2007 agreement			2
" in particular , manufacturers of @entity3 cars and trucks will have much more access to the @entity6 market , will encourage the development of electric cars and green technology in the @entity3 and will continue to ensure a level playing field for @entity3 automakers here at home , " @entity2 said			0
the deal sparked an almost immediate response from @entity81 , a liberal group that characterized it as a " @entity84 - style trade deal			0
" " choosing to advance @entity27 's @entity84 - style @entity6 free trade agreement rather than the new trade policy president @entity2 promised during his campaign will mean more @entity3 job loss , " @entity85 , the director of @entity81 's @entity86 said in a statement			2
but a number of business leaders praised the deal			1
" the resulting agreement provides greater clarity and transparency by affirmatively addressing the issues surrounding non-tariff and tariff barriers , " @entity96 ceo @entity95 said as part of a statement released by the @entity99			0
