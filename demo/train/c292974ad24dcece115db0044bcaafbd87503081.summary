-- the answer to @entity3 's endless woes is right in front of its corporate eyes			1
the answer is wearing a plain white t - shirt			1
and the answer has a name : @entity8			2
@entity3 's -- the century - old chain of midmarket department stores that were once a solid downtown presence in big cities and small towns in every state -- is floundering			1
it seems to be in utter turmoil , and has been for a while			0
some members of its board of directors have been at each other 's throats ; one of those directors , @entity22 , resigned last week after publicly upbraiding the others			2
the ceo 's office might as well have a revolving door			0
last fiscal year , according to @entity28 , @entity3 's lost $ 1 billion as sales dropped 25 %			1
after a previous ceo was fired , the company took out advertisements apologizing to its customers for what the shopping experience had become			0
the in - store staff was reported to be demoralized and confused as the once steadfast and prosperous chain struggled to figure out what it even is			0
what @entity3 's needs right now , more than anything else , is some defining			1
he died in an automobile crash in 1955 at the age of 24			0
he had made just three movies : " @entity46 , " " @entity47 " and " @entity48			0
" but his mystique and glamour have only become bigger over the decades			0
@entity8 , now and forever , is the very picture of youthful cool			2
he never grew old -- so he never grows old			0
what does this have to do with @entity3 ? for years after @entity8 's death , there were young men all over the @entity58 who went to @entity3 's for one reason : they believed -- the rumor was widespread -- that the t - shirt for which @entity8 was known was a @entity63 t - shirt			1
it was what @entity8 -- born in @entity69 , @entity70 , smack dab in the middle of @entity3 country -- favored			1
or , at any rate , that was the legend -- what today might be called an urban legend			2
it was passed from one guy to another , without anyone being quite sure where he 'd first heard it			0
back then -- i can vouch for this -- young men fervently believed it , and it brought them to @entity3 's			1
@entity3 's , at least in their minds , was @entity89			1
their conviction about @entity8 and the @entity63 t - shirt was like the unshakable conviction among young @entity58 in the early 1960s that the lyrics to " @entity94 " were dirty			1
because of the pervasiveness of the belief , it became accepted reality			0
to quote from " @entity99 " -- which starred another beloved @entity8 , @entity100 -- " when the legend becomes fact , print the legend			2
" @entity3 's should aggressively embrace this			1
it should print the legend			0
it should pay whatever it takes to the estate of @entity8 to purchase the rights to an image of him in a classic white t - shirt			1
and he should become the face of the chain			0
what has it got to lose ? nothing else is working			0
it has struggled with various strategies to lure shoppers , especially young shoppers			0
but @entity8 is everlastingly young , perpetually rebellious			2
" live fast , die young , and leave a beautiful corpse " is a phrase often associated with him , although he did not originate it			0
if @entity3 's were to make @entity8 the consistent image of the company , the stores themselves might find a fresh chance at life in the victory lane			1
let @entity133 and @entity134 and @entity135 and @entity136 and @entity137 and @entity138 and all the faceless stores in all the faceless malls be just that : faceless			0
@entity3 's needs to separate itself from the pack			1
@entity8 , and that t - shirt , are the antithesis of , even the antidote to , so much of what ails contemporary culture			1
frantic self - promotion and garish logos and slogans plastered on every surface and the " look - at - me " attitude of modern life -- what is a more stark rejection of that than a plain white t - shirt ? if you can get customers into your store to buy one thing , they just may stay to buy other things			1
the trick is getting those customers to come back through the front door			2
@entity8 did it once for @entity3 's , without even trying			1
the chain ought to roll the dice and see if he can do it again			0
as it is , the recent face of @entity3 's has been the face of its feuding board of directors , bickering with each other as if they are auditioning for a movie called " @entity177			1
" as @entity8 once cried out from a movie screen : " you 're tearing me apart ! " that has to come to an end			2
the stores deserve to survive and thrive , to be the reliable part of @entity58 life that they were when they were steady on their feet			2
right now , @entity3 's problem is that no one really knows what it stands for			1
let it decide it wants to stand for that which is eternal and cool			0
and let it turn for help to he who is @entity199			0
would it be a risk for @entity3 's ? would it be taking a big chance ? sure			1
but , as @entity8 himself once reportedly said : " dream as if you 'll live forever			2
live as if you 'll die today			0
" that goes for businesses , too			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : @entity3 is in trouble ; could @entity8 be the answer ?
he says urban legend was that @entity8 wore @entity3 's plain , white @entity63 t - shirt
he says @entity3 should use that ; adopt @entity8 as face of its brand , win back customers
@entity210 : @entity3 's , a *stalwart* of @entity58 *retail* , could break from pack with @entity8 's help
