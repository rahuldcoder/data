-- in 1986 @entity1 hit her head -- hard -- in a car accident			1
the result was more than a concussion			1
afterward , when @entity1 looked at people , she saw images of events occurring in their lives and had flashes of insight about them			1
with uncanny knowledge of their situations , she has been able to advise clients on everything from job searches to divorce proceedings			1
@entity1 refers to her work as intuitive counseling , and though her vocation may seem rarefied , she believes that intuitive power is available to everyone			1
" to me it 's our body 's radar , helping us make all sorts of decisions -- if only we 're willing to pay attention			2
" @entity0 : 10 questions that have no right to go away my intuition has gone through a metamorphosis from the time i was a young child to where i am now			1
i used to just get feelings			2
i went from getting feelings to having dreams , to seeing symbols that meant things , to seeing things actually happening to other people , to feeling that what 's happening to other people is happening to me			1
intuition is knowing without knowing			1
it 's instinctively knowing something that you do n't know how you know			1
you meet people and you have a subconscious feeling : you like them or not			1
you trust them or you do n't			2
and sometimes you stop and think , where does that come from ? what is that ? @entity0 : when to trust your gut i believe that just as we hear and see and smell and taste , this is another sense we have , but it 's one we do n't recognize			1
i think it 's almost an animal sense that we 've forgotten			1
we were better at intuition in the past			1
with modern technology and the frantic pace of life , most people today spend their lives running			1
there 's no time for the mind to be quiet to listen to anything			2
and then when a problem comes : trauma			2
because people are not in touch with themselves at all			1
you have to incorporate in your day some quiet time to listen to that voice			2
if you do n't , you wo n't hear it			2
it 's meant to guide us			2
@entity0 : are you listening to your life ? if you were to go out and meet somebody , spend an hour with them , and there was an attraction , and you came back home and wrote down the first thing you felt when you saw them , when they spoke to you , when they touched your shoulder -- you may not realize it , but you 'd find that you 'd already built a subconscious profile of the person			2
we all have that capability , but we do n't use it			2
i 'll tell you a group who uses intuition : people who do martial arts			1
they have to anticipate what their opponent 's going to do			2
remember @entity114 ? even people coming from behind , he could see			1
it 's like he had eyes in the back of his head			1
there are times when you get a feeling about something -- say , i do n't want to get on this flight -- and you wonder : is it my anxiety , or is it real ? it 's difficult to know what 's fact or fiction			0
you can only judge over a period of time			0
you have to gain confidence in your ability to listen			0
number one , you can build up to 15 minutes a day of sitting and focusing on your breathing			0
so that you have quiet time to connect with your inner self			0
@entity0 : 7 ways to reduce your stress from dr. @entity147 number two , every day , live the day and enjoy the day			0
do n't be anxious about , is this gon na happen or is that gon na happen ? walk through your day -- do n't run			0
get a little notebook , a tiny thing that fits in your pocket			0
when you have a feeling about something , write it down			0
that way , when your feeling later turns out to have been correct , you can go back and see that your instincts were working			0
and that builds your confidence			0
intuition is like a muscle			1
you develop it the more you use it			0
one of the worst things in life is indecision and confusion			0
but confusion is sometimes a blessing when it stops you from making a move , because sometimes you 're not supposed to make a move			0
i say to people , " you do n't walk down stairs blindfolded , you do n't drive a car blindfolded -- why would you want to make massive life - changing decisions when you ca n't see what you 're doing ? you have to wait for clarity			1
" so to me , confusion can be a kind of intuition : your body 's way of saying , do n't do anything right now -- just go with the flow and the answer will come			1
i 've given lots of talks , to all kinds of groups , and sometimes you 'll get people -- usually men -- who will say , " i think it 's a load of old rubbish			1
" and i 'll say , " well , that 's your belief			0
i 'm not here to change your belief			0
" the most important thing is just to trust it			0
trust that first feeling you feel about something			0
because that very first feeling is usually the right one			0
