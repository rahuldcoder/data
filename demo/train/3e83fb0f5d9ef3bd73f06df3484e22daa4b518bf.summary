a @entity2 @entity1 woman who was sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith -- and then released -- was detained with her family on tuesday as they tried to leave the @entity7 country			1
her legal team told @entity9 that @entity10 , her @entity12 husband , @entity11 , and their two children were stopped at an airport in @entity15 and interrogated at national security headquarters in the @entity2 capital			1
the problem involved what the legal team described as an alleged " irregularity with her documentation , " according to @entity25 's lawyers , who said she was in police custody			2
@entity25 has a @entity12 visa and was headed to the @entity12 with her family , her legal team said			1
the @entity29 said the family was stopped at the airport			0
" the @entity29 has been informed by the @entity2 government that the family was temporarily detained at the airport for several hours by the government for questioning over issues related to their travel , and i think travel documents , " said spokeswoman @entity32			1
" they have not been arrested			0
the government has assured us of their safety			0
" @entity32 said that the @entity12 embassy " has been and will remain highly involved in working with the family and the government , " saying " we are engaging directly with @entity2 officials to secure their safe and swift departure from @entity2			1
" @entity2 authorities said @entity25 had been detained because of the documents she submitted			1
@entity2 's @entity49 and @entity50 said that she had @entity2 travel documents , despite not being a citizen of @entity2 , and she was heading to the @entity12 , which is not her native country			1
" this was considered illegal by the @entity2 authorities , who have summoned both the @entity12 and @entity2 ambassadors , " the agency said in a message posted on its media @entity57 early wednesday			1
the airport detention came a day after @entity25 's legal team announced the 27 - year - old woman had been released from prison after weeks of international controversy over her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges			1
according to her lawyer , the case began when one of @entity25 's relatives , a @entity75 , filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married @entity11 , a @entity1 , after she was missing for several years			1
the @entity2 court considered @entity75 because her father was @entity75 , but she said she was a @entity1 and never practiced @entity80			2
she was charged with adultery , because a @entity75 woman 's marriage to a @entity1 man is illegal in @entity2 , and with apostasy , accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith			1
authorities warned her to renounce @entity89 by may 15 , but she did not , instead responding that her mother , an @entity1 , raised her as a @entity1			0
she said her @entity2 @entity75 father abandoned her when she was 6			2
" i am a @entity1 , " she said during her sentencing hearing last month , " and i will remain a @entity1			0
" she was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging , along with 100 lashes			0
@entity2 @entity97 speaker @entity96 defended the apostasy conviction , insisting last month that @entity25 was raised in a @entity75 environment			1
after her sentence drew international condemnation from rights groups and foreign embassies in @entity15 -- including those of the @entity12 , @entity105 and @entity106 -- an appeals court this month ruled that the judgment against her was faulty and she was released , according to her lawyer			2
her husband , @entity11 , called @entity9 on tuesday to say he and his family were being held at the national security office , but he provided no additional information			0
@entity25 's legal team said the family was trying to leave the country when it was stopped by authorities and taken to the security headquarters			1
meanwhile , a man who says he is @entity25 's brother , @entity118 , slammed the appellate court 's decision and hinted at retribution			2
" the family is unconvinced by the court 's decision			0
we were not informed by the court that she was to be released ; this came as a surprise to us , " @entity125 said tuesday			0
" the law has failed to uphold our rights			0
this is now an issue of honor			0
the @entity135 have tarnished our honor , and we will know how to avenge it			0
" @entity118 did not comment on @entity25 's detention at the airport on tuesday			2
in court proceedings earlier this year , @entity25 denied being related to @entity125			0
@entity25 gave birth to her second child -- a girl -- in prison last month			0
her first child , a 1 - year - old son , stayed with her at the prison but was free to leave at any time , @entity25 's lawyer said .			2

they cite problems with @entity10 's travel documents
