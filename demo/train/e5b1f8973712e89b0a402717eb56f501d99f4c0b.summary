-- @entity1 douses the idea of his returning to the @entity3 -- where he faces charges of espionage and theft of government property for leaking sensational details of spy programs -- saying he wo n't come back unless laws are changed			1
asked by @entity0 's @entity11 in an online chat thursday about conditions for a return home , @entity1 said that while his coming back " is the best resolution " for all parties , " it 's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistle - blower protection laws			1
" he pointed out that the government 's @entity20 does n't cover someone like him , a former government contractor			0
" there are so many holes in the laws , the protections they afford are so weak , and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing , " he wrote			2
" ... my case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistle - blower protection act reform			1
" @entity1 offered his remarks from @entity35 , where he 's been since june having been granted a one - year asylum			1
from there , he has continued to speak out to journalists and online			0
thursday 's chat -- coordinated by @entity41 , an organization set up to support @entity1 and his cause -- was one example of his outreach , letting him answer questions from anyone who posed a question online			2
the @entity3 government has n't stayed silent on his case either			2
on thursday , around the time that @entity1 was answering questions online , attorney general @entity50 said that " if mr. @entity1 wanted to come back to the @entity3 and enter a plea , we would engage with his lawyers			1
" the government would take the same tack with anyone willing to plead guilty. , @entity50 said at the event at the @entity61 's @entity60			0
but in @entity1 's case , the attorney general insisted , " @entity63 is n't something that we ( are ) willing to consider			2
" such a standoff is nothing new , as the @entity3 government and @entity1 have been at odds since the @entity70 and @entity71 newspapers first published stories last june based on secret documents he 'd provided them			1
these and subsequent reports transformed the once relatively anonymous 30 - year - old into a lightning rod for critics who called him a traitor and a hero for those who cheered his exposing what they see as dangerous infringements on civil liberties			0
whatever one 's opinion of him , the leaks undoubtedly brought intense scrutiny to the @entity92 's surveillance programs , causing headaches for the @entity3 government , domestically and internationally			1
this uproar spurred president @entity95 this month to unveil new guidance for intelligence gathering as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation 's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and liberties			0
nonetheless , some civil libertarians , members of @entity107 and others complained that @entity95 did n't go far enough			0
among other things , they point to the fact that someone will still collect records of the numbers and times of phone calls by every @entity3 -- one of the most controversial programs revealed by @entity1 -- even if access to the those records will be tightened and they may be shifted from the @entity92 to elsewhere			1
@entity1 echoed such critics when asked about @entity95 's speech in relation to thursday 's release of a privacy review board 's report critical of the government			0
the five - member @entity129 concluded the @entity92 's collection of data on nearly every @entity3 phone call is n't legal and has proven largely useless in thwarting terrorism			2
board : @entity92 phone data program illegal " when even the federal government says the @entity92 violated the constitution at least 120 million times under a single program , but failed to discover even a single plot , it 's time to end bulk collection , which is a euphemism for mass surveillance , " @entity1 wrote , pointing to the review 's report			1
" there is simply no justification for continuing an unconstitutional policy with a 0 % success rate			0
" in thursday 's chat , @entity1 insisted " not all spying is bad			0
" he said his issue is more with " the new technique of indiscriminate mass surveillance , where governments are seizing billions and billions and billions of innocents ' communication every single day			1
" such programs exist in part " because new technologies make it easy and cheap , " not because they are particularly effective in targeting threats and wrongdoers , he claimed			0
@entity1 said he acted because he felt compelled " to push back			2
" " it 's not good for our country , it 's not good for the world , and i was n't going to stand by and watch it happen , no matter how much it cost me , " he wrote			0
" the @entity92 and the rest of the @entity173 is exceptionally well positioned to meet our intelligence requirements through targeted surveillance -- the same way we 've always done it -- without resorting to the mass surveillance of entire populations			1
" his decision to collect and release secret documents have helped make @entity1 one of @entity3 's most high - profile critics since @entity184 ' @entity183			1
who notably has been one of @entity1 's biggest supporters			0
yet @entity1 said thursday that he has n't given up hope for his native land , saying " what makes our country strong is our system of values			0
" " we can correct the laws , restrain the overreach of agencies , and hold the senior officials responsible for abusive programs to account , " he said			1
@entity0 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0

now in @entity35 , @entity1 is charged in the @entity3 with espionage
he says @entity3 must change whistle - blower protections before he comes back
*ex-government* contractor *slams* what he calls " indiscriminate mass surveillance "
he says @entity3 " can correct the laws , restrain the overreach of agencies "
