@entity0 -- for an island country that spans less than 800 square miles , and hosts a little over one million inhabitants , @entity0 is surprisingly multicultural			1
though 80 % of the populace are descendants from the country 's early settlers , they are made of a mix of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 heritage			1
the nation 's diversity makes for a rich , cultural smorgasbord whose presence is felt in the local food , music and architecture			0
history part of the tiny country 's worldliness is due to the fact that it was occupied by an array of nations			1
the @entity31 took control in 1638 , only to be followed by the @entity13 and ultimately the @entity33 before the island 's independence in 1968			1
under the @entity31 and the @entity13 , slaves brought over from other @entity12 nations drove a large part of the economy			1
many of the island 's remote regions -- particularly @entity43 -- became refuges for escaped slaves			1
" during the @entity13 period , 5 % of slaves left their property and went to settle in natural places in a quest for independence -- 10 % during the @entity33 period , " says @entity46 , a local historian			1
" [ on @entity43 ] , they lived in such an isolated place that they were not even aware when slavery had been abolished			0
when people were coming around , [ many former slaves ] thought they were slave hunters and they just threw themselves down the mountain and killed themselves in this way , " he adds			2
though slavery on the island was abolished in 1835 , the @entity33 introduced indentured laborers from @entity11 onto the island to work in the sugar industry			1
around 450,000 were brought to live on the island			0
many of their descendants still live there today , lending @entity73 influences to the @entity12 nation			2
food nothing illustrates the melting - pot nature of @entity0 quite as succinctly as the cuisine			2
at the bustling @entity80 in the capital @entity82 , thousands of people come daily to search out a global array of produce , from cassava to soy sauce , and dahl to roti			0
" you can get all things here			0
there 's a @entity15 section , you can get @entity95 fruits and vegetables over there			2
we use some roots , some local things , @entity104 things and we mix it and create one plate here , " says @entity97 , a chef at one of the island 's five - star hotels			1
music it should probably come as no surprise that the local music also incorporates a range of styles			0
@entity113 -- the traditional music of the island -- has recently given way to a whole new style that borrows heavily from reggae			0
" we started to think , ' how are we going to start a new style of music to express the real problems of @entity0 ? ' so we started to set about a fusion with reggae music , because in this time reggae was started to be listened to in @entity0 , " explains @entity121 , a local musician who has championed the new style			0
" this music has become like a liberation , you know ? music has no border , even when the authorities want to border in the music , it 's like the wind , it 's like water			0
you ca n't block music ; there 's a lot of ways to express music , " he says .			0
