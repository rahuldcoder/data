-- at a moment when diplomacy is back in the international spotlight , are @entity1 becoming more isolationist , wanting the @entity1 to pull back from the world ? you might think so listening to @entity7			1
republicans like sens. @entity9 and @entity10 are betting their presidential aspirations on it			1
@entity14 strategist @entity13 released a memo identifying " pull back from the rest of the world " as the no. 1 area of consensus across the political spectrum ahead of the 2014 elections			0
and , at first , it looks like they may be on to something			0
but as you dig deeper , you might see they are missing the point			0
yes , poll after poll has shown that if you ask @entity1 to choose between focusing on problems at home or abroad , they overwhelmingly call for focusing at home			1
a recent @entity35 / @entity34 poll released last week found an overwhelming 88 % of @entity1 agreed			1
along with the @entity39 administration 's inability to muster congressional support for limited military strikes against @entity42 ( and the @entity44 failure to win approval in their parliament ) , this is often seen as the latest sign of war - weary populations that do n't want anything to do with international entanglements			0
yet , a closer look at how @entity1 think about the world today provides a note of caution before joining the isolationist bandwagon			1
@entity1 are clearly reluctant to support military intervention			2
they may agree with former secretary of defense @entity58 , that anyone " who advises the president to again send a big @entity1 land army into @entity65 or into the @entity66 or @entity67 should ' have his head examined			2
' " but rather than pulling back , @entity1 are looking for leadership to tackle today 's most difficult global challenges , even if they are n't always sure how to deal with them			1
the world seems a more dangerous place than just three years ago			2
compared with 2010 , the poll shows that 22 % more americans see a nuclear or chemical attack in the world as a real threat , and 13 % more @entity1 see a terrorist attack in their country as a real threat			1
over this time , support for global engagement through civilian means of diplomacy and development has stayed surprisingly stable			0
three - quarters of @entity1 agree that their country has a responsibility to be a moral leader for the world , a figure largely unchanged since 2010			1
they support economic sanctions against countries that behave badly and helping to respond to natural disasters or famines			0
even after a decade of wars in @entity95 and @entity96 , majorities agree their country should help the growth of democracy and assist countries with less developed economies			0
the problem is that @entity1 are n't sure what will work in today 's challenging world			1
it 's amazing to see that 66 % of @entity1 supported the deal to place @entity42 's chemical weapons under international control , while only 36 % of them believed it will succeed			1
@entity1 know that today 's global threats rarely have military solutions and no longer resemble the @entity112 conflicts between strong states			1
an overwhelming majority say that , in today 's world , economic power is more important than military power -- as do most people around the world			0
but if you ask @entity1 whether under some conditions war is necessary to obtain justice , three - quarters of @entity1 still agree , unlike most @entity123 and @entity124			1
it is sobering to note that only in @entity126 is there stronger support for war at 80 %			0
part of the challenge is that @entity1 know the @entity1 can not solve today 's global problems alone , but we are hardly unique in wanting to focus on economic problems at home			2
among the 20 countries surveyed in the @entity35 / @entity34 poll , every country but @entity136 felt it should focus more on problems at home			0
even 75 % of @entity124 agree , and @entity124 is the country the rest of the world regularly sees as having the most positive influence on the world			2
while the economy has slowly been showing signs of recovery , perhaps the desire to focus on problems at home is the continued hangover from the financial crisis			0
it turns out that there is only a modest difference in support for global engagement among @entity1 who see the economy negatively , with about 10 % fewer ( but still majorities ) agreeing			1
the drop - off among those who see the economy negatively is greater ( about 30 % ) on support for assisting countries with less developed economies			2
this suggests that policymakers and global development advocates need to do a better job making the economic argument that today 's fastest - growing economies are in the developing world , not in our traditional trading partners in @entity123 and @entity174 , and that the emerging middle classes in @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity126 and across @entity67 are the new markets for goods and services			2
all signs are that business understands this , but the public may not yet			0
we 're seeing a remarkable resurgence of diplomacy , whether in the first steps toward a deal to prevent @entity190 from acquiring nuclear weapons or in the @entity66 peace process			0
but the passionate reactions against the @entity190 agreement suggest that some have come to see diplomacy as weakness			0
this is unfortunate , as @entity1 are looking for leadership , not conflict , in a world that they feel is growing ever more dangerous			1
let 's hope that cooler heads will prevail in the months ahead and see this as an opportunity for the @entity1 to work with our allies to lower the temperature and work to build a safer world			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

@entity210 : @entity212 are betting presidential aspirations that @entity1 want to stay out of global *hotspots*
new survey shows 88 % of @entity1 agreed
@entity210 : but @entity1 are looking for leadership , not conflict , in a more dangerous world
poll also shows three - quarters of @entity1 say that @entity1 has a responsibility to be a moral leader for the world
