@entity0 -- for political junkies , 2013 was expected to be a quiet year following the presidential election and it basically followed the script			1
nonetheless , there were some interesting developments at the ballot box			1
@entity9 , as expected , returned gov. @entity10 to office and also sent @entity12 to the @entity13			1
@entity14 became the first @entity15 elected @entity17 mayor in two decades , and @entity18 , led by @entity19 , swept the top three executive offices in @entity21 for the first time in recent memory			1
were these outcomes isolated or do they mean anything for 2014 , when candidates will heat up the campaign trail big time ahead of next november 's congressional midterms and key gubernatorial elections ? in the new year , 435 @entity32 seats are up as are 35 in the @entity13			1
there will be 36 gubernatorial races as well			1
most of these campaigns wo n't be nail biters , but there could be collective power shifts in @entity0 and in state houses			2
here , @entity41 focuses on the @entity13 , where @entity42 aim to retake control			1
republicans must pick up six seats to claim the majority and key races are wide open at this point			1
the top 12 campaign questions of 2014 five key races : @entity51 the incumbent is senate minority leader @entity53 , who is under pressure from two fronts : democrats , naturally , and from a tea party challenger within his own @entity42 who says he 's not conservative enough			1
while @entity59 is likely to defeat his primary opponent , @entity60 , he is expending money and other resources he 'd rather use in a general election campaign against @entity51 secretary of state @entity64			1
the @entity51 race is likely to be one of the most expensive nationally			1
as a leader of the @entity42 , @entity59 has access to major donors and party members do n't like to see their leaders lose			1
@entity18 want @entity59 out and are investing heavily , too			2
2014 : the year of the blame game in @entity0 @entity74 @entity75 put @entity74 politics on the national map in 2008 but her @entity42 lost a @entity13 seat that year			1
@entity18 incumbent @entity79 is running again , but the @entity42 sees the seat as winnable			2
@entity79 is n't unpopular but a @entity18 senator in the reliably red state is just about as rare as a 70 - degree winter day in @entity84			2
the @entity42 aims to demonstrate that @entity79 's election was a fluke and not the start of a trend , and he is fully aware that the road to reelection will be tough			2
he is already trying to dissociate himself from the @entity18 with the self - defining tagline : " as independent as @entity74			2
" @entity79 is also distancing himself from president @entity93 , who 's struggling in polls , and the @entity95 , the president 's health care reforms that are unpopular with @entity42			2
three republicans are vying for the chance to take on @entity79 : lt. gov. @entity100 , @entity101 , a former state official , and @entity103 , who sought to unseat @entity74 's other senator , @entity104 , in 2010			1
she lost to him in the @entity42 primary but prevailed as an @entity106 in the general election			2
@entity108 for sen. @entity110 , it 's deja vu			2
as a @entity15 in an increasingly red state , @entity110 narrowly won her 1996 , 2002 and 2008 elections , and her 2014 bid should be just as challenging			2
@entity42 are already hammering @entity110 over the airwaves for her vote in favor of the @entity95			2
but the candidate preferred by the @entity42 establishment , rep. @entity117 , must also contend with @entity120 , a retired @entity122 @entity121 colonel , in a primary			2
@entity120 is a tea party favorite			0
" this race has a long way to go , particularly since @entity117 is n't well known outside his district , but it is safe to say that this may end up being the most difficult race of @entity110 's @entity13 career , " wrote @entity126 , senior editor at the non-partisan @entity127			1
in @entity108 , all candidates run on a single " primary " ballot in november			1
if someone breaks the 50 % mark , there 's no general election			0
but if that threshold is not broken , the top two finishers head to a run - off in december			0
@entity144 @entity144 's @entity13 seat should remain safely in @entity42 hands in the general election , but an already very contentious contest for the @entity42 nomination should keep the race in the spotlight for much of 2014 , since the primary 's not until august 19			1
things got ugly immediately after @entity154 , the eldest daughter of former vice president @entity155 , announced in july that she would mount a primary challenge against three - term @entity42 sen. @entity157 , who faced no @entity42 opposition in his last re-election bid			0
both sides have attacked each , from claims of carpet bagging to whether the @entity104 and the former vice president were actually fishing buddies			0
@entity154 even got into a very public squabble over same - sex marriage with her younger sister , who 's married to another woman			0
while polls indicate @entity157 is the front - runner , @entity155 has some advantages			0
" @entity154 does n't appear to be getting much traction against @entity157 , but she will be well - funded and @entity157 ca n't afford to take her for granted , " cautioned @entity126			0
while entertaining , @entity144 's primary race does n't appear to be following the typical grassroots vs. mainstream script			1
" @entity144 is somewhat of a misfit race , not only because it is last on the calendar but the @entity42 race between sen. @entity157 and @entity154 does n't fit neatly into the establishment vs. anti-establishment narrative			1
anyone with the last name of @entity155 is n't exactly a political outsider in a @entity42 contest , " writes @entity183 , deputy editor of the non-partisan @entity184			0
@entity189 the @entity191 seat up for grabs is held by a @entity42 who decided not to seek reelection			0
that leaves a wide open battle for fresh faces			0
in a traditionally @entity42 state , which @entity200 won by 7 points in 2012 , democrats are making a play in what @entity203 sees as " one of the @entity18 ' few opportunities " to pick up a seat			1
the @entity18 candidate has never run for office before but her well - known family name could help her cause			0
@entity213 , the daughter of former sen. @entity214 , " has run a very strong campaign " for a first - time candidate @entity126 wrote			0
the @entity42 side of the race is interesting as well with eight candidates battling to win the nomination			1
they include three sitting members of @entity222 and a former @entity189 secretary of state			0
reps @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 are all trying to outdo each other on the conservative side			0
a far - right platform could result in electoral success in the primary but make it more difficult for the nominee to beat @entity214 in the general election			0
the biggest campaign moments of 2013 those are the five big ones , but there are some other races to watch , too			1
@entity240 : @entity18 sen. @entity241 , a former governor , appears as of now to be on the road to re-election in the @entity240			0
but all eyes are on former @entity245 sen. @entity245 , who 's been flirting with a run			0
if @entity245 does go , this contest would immediately land in the national political spotlight			1
@entity245 represented @entity249 in the @entity13 but lost his reelection bid in 2012 and his move to @entity240 is raising eyebrows			1
@entity253 : longtime @entity18 sen. @entity255 's retirement gives the @entity42 a prime pickup opportunity in this @entity258 swing state			0
but while @entity18 have rallied around four - term rep. @entity261 , the battle for the @entity42 nomination is wide open among candidates without strong name recognition			0
@entity264 and @entity265 : like @entity79 and @entity110 , @entity267 @entity266 of @entity265 and @entity268 of @entity264 face tough re-elections in @entity42 friendly states			0
@entity271 , @entity21 , and @entity272 : the retirements of longtime @entity275 @entity274 of @entity271 , @entity276 of @entity21 , and @entity277 of @entity272 could put @entity18 in a bind			0
all three states are considered red , and all , especially @entity272 , present the @entity42 with prime pickup opportunities			0
a white mayor for the ' @entity283 ' ?			0

there are 435 @entity32 seats and 35 @entity13 seats up in november midterms
republicans must pick up six seats to win control of the @entity13
*additionally* , there are 36 gubernatorial races , a number of them with national *implications*
@entity51 could be the most expensive race with @entity13 minority leader @entity53 up
