-- @entity1 has urged football authorities to give referees " all the power " in the game 's bid to stamp out racism on and off the pitch			1
the @entity10 star started something big when he walked off during a friendly match in january in protest at racist abuse from the crowd , and he told @entity0 he is determined to help bring in even stronger sanctions to combat one of the game 's biggest problems			1
" i would give all the power to the referees , " he said friday before meeting with the head of football 's governing body to discuss issues of discrimination			1
" i would even go so far to say , even if you hear a little bit , and you hear it again , stop the game -- because that 's the only way i think you can make these voices silent			2
that 's the only way			2
" even maybe put people in the stadium , maybe sit some people in the crowd so that they can hear and see maybe that it 's racial or that it 's very aggressive ... and tell ( the match officials ) what they heard			2
" after the meeting with @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity41 announced that @entity1 has been invited to become part of its task force against racism and discrimination			1
the other members have yet to be named , but @entity1 hopes they will be able to lay down strong guidelines to deter racist behavior			1
" i hope they are going to wake up tomorrow morning and say , ' today -- even more			0
' and , the next day wake up and say we fight even more against it , " said @entity1 , who on thursday gave a speech at a @entity55 conference in @entity56 discussing racism and sport			1
" in this moment now we are speaking about it , but to wake up tomorrow morning and do something about it , that 's a different thing			2
" things will change , i 'm very positive about that			0
we can see the changes already			0
there are going to be more sanctions -- harder -- and i think this is the right way , i 'm looking forward to that			2
" the 26 - year - old is still coming to terms with the impact of his actions in january , when his teammates followed him off the pitch			2
it not only ended the match against @entity82 fourth division team @entity81 , but it also sparked worldwide debate about whether it was the right thing to do			2
" at the end , after not even 10 minutes , i had like 86 phone calls on my phone and i thought something had happened , but it was just an unbelievable impact			0
it went all around the world within the first hour , " @entity1 said			1
" people were calling me , my agent was calling me , my family members , and i was like , what did i do ? because for me it was just a situation , i felt i needed to do that -- i was angry and a bit disappointed			0
but it was just unbelievable how it spread around the world			0
" @entity1 reiterated his stance that he would do the same again , if it was a top - level @entity101 match or even the @entity103 final			1
" i think we should not accept and tolerate it anywhere , or any game , whether it 's a friendly game or a @entity103 final			0
if i feel this is racial abuse i would even do it in a @entity112 final			0
" then of course it 's a different situation , there 's a lot of money involved			0
would my teammates all follow me ? i do n't know because it 's a totally different situation , but for my part i would do the same			1
" @entity1 admitted that when he was younger he had " ignored " racist abuse , but now as a father he is determined to make a difference			1
" i have a little son -- i 'm taking care of these things because i want my son to grow up in a nice place and not in a place where he has to be confronted by racism , " he said			0
@entity1 grew up in @entity132 and represented @entity133 at youth level , but switched allegiances to @entity136 -- where his father was born			1
he said earlier in his career he had no faith the football authorities would take effective steps against racism , but has recently been impressed with sanctions -- such as @entity145 club @entity144 banning one of its promising young players who made a fascist salute			1
" i thought it 's never going to change , maybe they will not ever do enough to fight against it			0
but now the most recent example we saw of it , i think they are doing much , much better -- that players get banned for playing forever for a club or teams playing without the supporters			0
" i think that is the right direction we have to move forward like that and i think then the people will understand			0
