-- " we 're ready to take control " confirms @entity1 , a well - seasoned pilot who has been flying for 37 years			1
" and proceed , " replies flight test engineer @entity3			1
@entity1 and @entity3 are looking at computer display screens , tracking the position of a modified @entity8 aircraft flying north towards @entity9 -- but there is one vital difference			1
@entity3 is high in the sky while @entity1 has his feet firmly on the ground			1
@entity3 is one of the flight test engineers onboard the test aircraft equipped with state - of - the - art drone technology along with the two pilots in the cockpit for the take - off and landing phases			1
after taking - off and climbing to an altitude of 7,000 feet , the pilots hand over to the flight test engineers who in turn hand over to @entity1			1
@entity1 is responsible for navigating the aircraft on a pre-planned route			1
calmly in front of his computer , he taps in coordinates to make the plane turn left and right , clearing it with air traffic control as any other pilot onboard would do			2
" flying an unmanned vehicle is not as much fun as flying a normal aircraft , however it has a lot of similar challenges , " explained @entity1 from the comfort of his armchair cockpit			1
see also : the rise of zombie airports @entity45 granted @entity0 exclusive access to one of their test flights in early july , allowing passengers aboard for the first time in the process			1
at the time of filming , the plane had already racked up 480 flight hours using specialist drone technology developed over the past six years as part of the $ 94 million @entity60 program			2
the project has brought together a consortium of six companies , @entity45 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
with increased automation in the cockpit , hopes are high that planes like those controlled by @entity1 can fly further and longer			2
for those at the cutting edge of the industry , this is an exciting milestone			1
" it 's probably the next major step in aviation , it 's a bit like introducing the jet engine , " said @entity60 program director , @entity78			2
" it 's a new branch of aviation all together			2
" " ( @entity85 ) we 've got to find ways of introducing technology to replace the man on the aircraft and indeed amending the regulations			2
all the ( current ) regulations assume a pilot to be onboard the aircraft and that 's the way it 's been for the past 100 years or so			1
" @entity45 and partners need to prove to regulators that it is possible for unmanned aircraft to fly safely in commercial airspace			1
" as industry , we 'd like a full set of regulations to build something to			0
the regulators would like us to show them a product			0
the problem is , because there is a big gap between our understanding of manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft , we somehow have got to work together to bridge that gap and that 's what the @entity60 programme is all about , " says @entity78			1
however unmanned passenger flights are unlikely to be taking - off in the near future at least			0
instead , @entity119 - @entity78 believes the technology could first be adopted for cargo flights and for aircraft operating during hazardous emergencies such as wildfires			0
these developments could then be fed back into military design and used to make commercial aircraft safer			0
see also : how to travel using apps not maps the technology tested by @entity45 could also be transferred to other industries outside aviation			0
" we are only limited by the power of our imagination with this technology and capability , " said @entity133 , director of the @entity134 ( @entity134 )			0
" what is important ( is ) that drones are not just airborne , they are water and land based too ...			0
the @entity144 is an autonomous vehicle in many aspects			0
" there are many capabilities that are crying out for this technology -- agriculture , surveillance , inspection regimes -- but the breakthroughs will be where we discover applications of the technology not yet thought through			0
" for seasoned pilots such as @entity1 , however , the potential of this technology is about far more than the prospect of a profitable new industry			0
" i think there will be a number of people for instance who ca n't fly ( now ) -- they 're airsick or wheelchair - bound -- they 're not capable of being in the air			0
for them this will be an exciting future			0

@entity0 goes aboard a modified @entity8 test aircraft as it flies above northern @entity174
the aircraft is manned by a crew in the sky but controlled by a pilot on the ground
unmanned flight is an exciting milestone for those at the cutting edge of the aviation industry
