-- the @entity2 outbreak in @entity3 has hit " unprecedented " proportions , according to relief workers on the ground , with the @entity7 reporting 844 cases including 518 deaths since the epidemic began in march			1
there is no cure or vaccine to treat @entity2 , but the aid agency @entity15 has shown it does n't have to be a death sentence if treated early			1
@entity2 typically kills 90 % of patients but the death rate in this outbreak has dropped to roughly 60 %			1
one man who survived the disease describes how the virus took hold			1
how did you contract @entity2 ? i am an agronomist and i have two children , one boy and one girl			1
i work in the pharmacy at the health center of @entity30 in southern @entity31			2
when my father was hospitalized at the health center i naturally volunteered to be at his bedside so other family members would not have to make the daily trek of tens of kilometers , traversing the trails between their village and the facility			1
i cleaned him when he vomited and also did his laundry			2
i also often gave him food and drink			0
he had diarrhea at least eight times per day but i did not know he was suffering from @entity2			1
five days after being hospitalized , [ my father ] passed away			1
after his death the medical staff realized he had presented @entity2 symptoms and as i had close contact with him , it meant that i was at risk			1
so they told me that i needed to be followed up for 21 days and if ever i felt a small fever i had to come to the health center			0
the countdown then started for me : after nine days i got fever and this persisted until the 11th day			0
finally i went to the treatment center -- where i did an @entity2 test which was positive			1
what were the symptoms ? how did you feel while you were ill ? i first got a fever which persisted			0
my body temperature reached nearly @entity65 ( 104 degrees @entity66 )			0
after that i had diarrhea , vomits , dysentery and hiccups [ all symptoms of @entity2 ]			1
i went to the toilet several times a day and i felt so tired and uncomfortable			0
how and where were you treated ? i received medical assistance at the ebola treatment center , put in place at the health centre of @entity30			0
the medical staff provided me with oral medications and infusions			0
they also provided me with food			0
i suffered at lot in the beginning with diarrhoea and hiccups but with the treatment i started to feel better			0
what was the initial reaction in your home village after you recovered ? @entity96 , for my family because everyone thought that i would not survive this disease as many others people had died			1
however before the medical staff released me to go back to my family they tested me three times to make sure that i really had recovered			0
afterwards they gave me a certificate of discharge			0
they also visited my family , the leaders and elders of my community to inform them that i had recovered and i was no longer contagious			2
despite this , i was stigmatized			2
some people avoided me in the beginning but now , over time , they have learned to accept me			1
now they call me " @entity114			2
" you 're now working with @entity117 volunteers in @entity31 to raise awareness of the disease : what lessons are passing on ? i am part of a team of @entity117 volunteers , visiting communities , raising awareness on how to prevent the spread of the disease			2
one of the messages i try to pass on to the communities is to go early to the health center when sufferers first feel symptoms			0
the treatment is free of charge			0
people there will give you food and clothes and you can get a chance to survive			0
what 's your message for the outside world about @entity2 ? how can they help ? everyone should be mobilized			1
we need to educate people and increase the sensitization			0
this is the key to stop the dangerous disease @entity2			1
many people have already died , that is why i participate in activities [ to educate people ]			2
i urge people to go the isolation and treatment centres if they experience the earliest symptoms of the disease , to increase their chance of being cured and surviving .			2
