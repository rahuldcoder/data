tears were seen and blows were nearly thrown			0
this was not the pre-fight press conference weigh - in for a @entity10 - @entity9 boxing match			1
it was a panel discussion between @entity14 and @entity13 journalists from across the country to consider whether the @entity17 name was racist			1
but the conversation at the @entity20 convention , which included more than 6,000 media professionals , got nowhere			0
@entity22 on the @entity17 black journalists accused their @entity13 counterparts of showing racist videos during the panel of ranting black fans cheering for their beloved football team , including extensive video of the team 's then - beloved , now maligned @entity30 , the @entity14 - @entity14 man ( @entity30 ) who 's been the team 's unofficial mascot for 35 years			1
" black people are not the only @entity37 fans in the stadium , " i argued then			0
" where are the other fan faces ? and why is this a racial issue ? " our @entity13 peers yelled back , a few of them in tears , that we were being insensitive and ignorant for not understanding that the redskin name was hurtful and damaging to their community			1
everyone left the workshop insulted and insistent they were on the right side of the debate , including myself			2
and we never found common ground			0
that was nearly 20 years ago			0
so it was refreshing earlier this week to hear president @entity22 , the nation 's commander in chief and a sports fan , weigh in saying he 'd think about changing the name if he were the owner of the team			1
@entity63 seeks to force @entity65 name change " i do n't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things			2
... i do n't want to detract from the wonderful @entity17 fans that are here			1
they love their team and rightly so , " the president said to @entity74			1
i thought back to that @entity20 meeting and knew his words rang true			0
and i remembered several of my colleagues who , over the years , have tried to get me or others in the newsroom to feel their pain			0
and honestly , i just never gave it enough thought			0
but no longer can i justify my years of indifference to the sports moniker			2
let 's toss it in the trash heap along with other now offensive -- but once widely used -- monikers such as @entity93 , darky , dago and kike			1
and if you or team owner @entity96 , who insists he 'll never change the team name , are a bit insulted , that 's the whole point			1
it is exactly what my @entity13 colleagues struggled to tell us for as long as i can remember			0
predictably , many @entity17 fans are livid that the president would jump into this fight			1
they 're not the only people who can have an opinion about this matter			0
@entity114 politicians are sports fans , too			2
some of them have been quite engaged with popular sports conversations			2
president @entity117 brought " @entity119 " to the @entity118			2
@entity22 participates in the annual @entity121 bracket frenzy			1
for any fan , sports are among the most uplifting things about life			1
it 's the one place we can escape the worries in the grownup world and enjoy our childlike enthusiasm for the games			0
none of that feeling goes away with a name change in @entity37			0
supporters of keeping the team name can see only tradition and honor of the franchise			0
some are defensive -- rightfully , i believe -- about anyone saying they are somehow intentionally being malicious			0
@entity144 , an attorney for the @entity17 and an @entity22 supporter , said in an e-mail to the media that fans do n't intend to " disparage or disrespect " anyone			1
" the name ' @entity17 ' is 80 years old			1
it 's our history and legacy and tradition			2
" what else could he say ? he is paid by the team			0
but he must know that his argument just makes no sense			0
the football team 's glorious history may indeed stretch back 80 wonderful years , but what intelligent person , or even a diehard football fan like me , could seriously argue that 80 years of entertaining football history could ever compare to the thousands of years that the original @entity167 have inhabited this land ? it 's time to get on the right side of @entity14 history .			1

@entity22 *suggested* @entity17 consider changing the team name
@entity175 : as a sports fan , the president can weigh in -- and he 's right
she says @entity17 name is hurtful and damaging to @entity167
@entity182 : it 's time to get on the right side of history and change the 80 - year - old name
