when @entity1 ponder the world 's most desolate places , they tend to conjure @entity6 outposts , @entity8 mountaintops , central @entity10 plateaus or @entity12 brain stems			1
fact is , if you 're in the @entity1 you do n't have to travel halfway across the globe to separate yourself from civilization			1
you do n't even have to leave the continental @entity1			1
secluded swamps , forsaken tundra , vacuous canyons , yonder mountain ranges , deserted deserts -- despite all the development , the @entity1 is still home to plenty of untamed hinterland			1
here 's the ultimate list of those destinations with suggested activities for each			2
the criteria are as simple as they are vague : maximum distance from other humans and any signs of their existence , including but not limited to roads , posted signs , smokestacks , government surveillance , electronic dance music , @entity39 and cronuts			0
( and , as is so often the case , @entity42 and @entity43 not included			0
* ) camping @entity45 ( @entity46 ) in 2008 , @entity47 identified the most remote coordinates in the lower 48 @entity1 : @entity49 's @entity50			1
but there 's more to seclusion than geography -- chiefly , the absence not only of civilization , but civilians as well , and @entity49 hosted 3.19 million of them last year			1
according to an ecologist couple dedicated to identifying the most remote spot in each @entity1 state , that location is smack in the middle of @entity46 's @entity62			1
it took the couple five days hiking in , during which they encountered grizzly bears and mountain goats , traversed white limestone and red sandstone streams and crossed the @entity71 en route to maximum peoplelessness			0
@entity62 , 10 @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity46 ; +1 406 387 3800 hiking @entity77 ( @entity78 ) admittedly , there are hikes in the @entity1 more secluded than this section of @entity82			1
most of us without 10 days to throw at a nature walk , however , will find plenty of peace in the largest publicly protected area on the @entity1 mainland			1
the terrain varies from low - lying swamplands to the highest point in @entity93 , the summit of @entity95 ( 5,344 feet )			0
with its most isolated spot reaching nearly six miles from the nearest road , the @entity96 still attract thousands of hikers a year			1
but there are plenty of unmarked trails , high - elevation lakes and untrammeled terrain -- especially in the @entity106 ' western zone -- on which to avoid them			2
@entity96 , @entity110 / @entity109 , @entity78 ; +1 518 897 1200 sun - tanning @entity112 ( @entity113 ) the 5.5 - mile hike ( or seven - mile bike ride ) keeps the average beach - goer from reaching this vehicularly inaccessible notch of the popular @entity118			0
but the lush vegetation , unrivaled @entity121 views and downright alien beachside waterfall ( aka , @entity123 ) keep rewarding those who do			0
the falls are active year round , but peak in activity following the rainy season , from january to march			0
strong currents make the ocean more of an aesthetic rather than recreational feature of the beach , but once the morning fog of the summer months burns off , @entity133 's 2.5 miles of expansive sands and encompassing cliff - side ramparts make for a sunny yet secluded beach adventure			1
beaches of @entity118 , @entity138 , 1 @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity113 ; +1 415 464 5100 game tracking @entity142 ( @entity143 ) @entity144 calls it possibly the toughest hunt in @entity147			0
the goat are as abundant in @entity143 's high alpine areas as the treacherous peaks and cliff faces , making the @entity142 a destination of maximum risk and reward offering minimum human competition			2
according to @entity156 , the @entity157 and @entity158 peaks see the fewest interlopers , owing to the difficulty of the terrain , which is rife with mountain goat			0
other areas of the @entity142 support healthy deer , elk and moose -- but also hiker -- populations			0
while the altitudes are high and physical demands strenuous , if you 're a hunter , the greatest challenge may be drawing a big game tag in the state 's annual raffle			2
@entity176 , @entity177 , @entity143 ; +1 435 654 1791 canoeing @entity179 ( @entity180 ) the nation 's most famous paddleways are @entity184 's @entity183 -- explaining their absence here			1
@entity186 frequented , especially come summer , is the labyrinth of mangrove forests , @entity190 beaches and sawgrass marshes comprising @entity192			0
@entity179 is the 99 - mile corridor from @entity194 down to @entity195 , flanked by plenty of alternate routes that promise one of the most humanly deserted , biologically diverse wilds in the world ; more than 360 species of bird , endangered panthers and the only known coexistence of alligators and crocodiles on earth			2
mainland @entity180 's most remote spot can also be found within the ' @entity209 , 17 miles from the nearest road -- just one mile closer than @entity46 's farthest reach			1
@entity192 , main entrance at 40001 @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity180 ; +1 305 242 7700 waterfalls @entity216 ( @entity217 , @entity218 ) deep within the @entity223 's western edge , this @entity220 tribal village is the most remote community in the continental @entity1 , according to the @entity1 @entity225			1
mail here is still delivered via mule and , aside from helicopter , that 's the only transportation in or out			2
the 2,000 - foot descent down @entity232 into @entity217 starts at @entity233			0
eight miles later you 'll find a general store , a @entity237 church and the @entity238 , where fried bread is a staple			2
from there , @entity216 is just downstream			0
it 's a nearly 200 - feet tumble of incandescent blue - green waters for which the @entity220 are named			2
contact the @entity243 for information and entry permits			0
fishing @entity247 ( @entity184 ) the highest point of latitude on the @entity1 mainland is so remote the only way to reach it by land is through @entity253			1
in fact , being the product of a surveying error in the @entity257 , the @entity258 should by all rights be @entity253			0
instead , it 's one of few @entity1 points of entry to the @entity263 , a 1,700 - square - mile freshwater @entity265 with a world - class walleye population in addition to pike , perch , muskie , bass , trout , sturgeon , crappie and sauger			1
following a secessionist stunt in the late - 1990s intended to raise awareness of neighboring @entity280 's restrictive catch limits , visitors to the @entity282 are now able to keep their often trophy - size catches			2
@entity247 , @entity282 , @entity285 , @entity184 driving @entity286 ( @entity287 ) what was once a warning to tourists became the slogan for a tourism board			1
a 1986 @entity294 article dubbed the @entity287 stretch of this coast - to - coast highway " the @entity297 in @entity147			1
" an accompanying caveat from the @entity299 urged drivers to avoid @entity1 50 unless they were " confident of their survival skills			2
" the state has since seized on the reputation of its lonesome road , extolling the virtues of its vacuity and points of interest , including bygone mining camps , ghost towns and nuclear test sites			0
the highway mimics the old @entity315 route , traversing sand dunes and snowy mountains as well as @entity318 near its eastern terminus			0
the @entity320 road in @entity147 , @entity286 , @entity287 @entity321 @entity322 ( @entity42 ) * despite that disclaimer above excluding the 49th state , we ca n't help making one exception to this list because , if we 're being honest , just about the most remote everything in the @entity1 is located in @entity42			1
it has the most land and lowest population density of any state , while offering some of the richest natural spoils on earth			0
but the tiny island of @entity322 poses not only one of the most effective escapes from humanity , it also offers the kind of front - row vistas on @entity341 that once formed the putative centerpiece of @entity344 's foreign policy			0
in the middle of the 50 - mile expanse separating the @entity1 and its renewed rival is a population of approximately 40 people for whom it 's a hardscrabble life -- but the views of @entity351 are superb			1

@entity358 is a @entity359 - based writer and editor who has written for numerous publications and websites including @entity363 , @entity364 and @entity365 .			0

despite development , the @entity1 has plenty of untamed hinterland
most remote coordinates in lower 48 states are in @entity49
mainland @entity180 's most remote spot is 17 miles from the nearest road
