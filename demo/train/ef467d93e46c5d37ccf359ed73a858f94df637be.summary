by calling @entity4 troops into @entity5 , @entity6 , authorities are taking the situation " to the opposite extreme of community policing , " a former @entity1 assistant director says			1
@entity10 , a @entity11 law enforcement analyst , notes that just a few days ago , authorities were out on the streets shaking hands with marchers			1
capt. @entity19 of the @entity20 " was like @entity16 , promising to ensure their safety , " @entity10 said			2
but growing violence -- amid protests over the shooting death of unarmed teen @entity24 by a police officer -- changed the situation			2
" given these deliberate , coordinated and intensifying violent attacks on lives and property in @entity5 , i am directing the highly capable men and women of the @entity34 ... in restoring peace and order to this community , " gov. @entity27 said in a statement monday			1
police in the @entity5 area , just like many all over the country , have military equipment , which they used last week			2
so why bring in the guard at all ? " you do n't want extremely tired , fatigued , overtaxed police officers out there day after day , night after night , " @entity10 said			1
and state patrol officers who came in from out of town and are staying in hotels , working around the clock , are surely getting fatigued as well , he said			0
" you do n't need more military equipment ; it 's more of a manpower issue			0
" but there are other reasons it may make sense to replace police on the scene , analysts say			0
members of the @entity34 may better follow a " unified chain of command , " said @entity63 , an @entity64 veteran and senior editor of @entity66 , which analyzes national security issues			1
complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity5 in this case , that could be a big improvement			0
" i 've never seen such a disjointed police effort as this , " @entity10 said			1
@entity27 said the guard will assist col. @entity76 , head of the @entity20 , " in restoring peace and order to this community			2
" in a later statement , @entity27 said the guard 's " immediate and limited responsibilities " are to " provide protection , and ensure the safety of our @entity85 , which was the target last night of a coordinated attack			1
the guard will concentrate its resources on carrying out this limited mission			1
" " with these additional resources in place , the @entity20 and local law enforcement will continue to respond appropriately to incidents of lawlessness and violence , and protect the civil rights of all peaceful citizens to make their voices heard			0
" if military police are among the guard troops , they 'll have special training in crowd control that may help , @entity63 says			0
@entity10 rejects that idea , saying @entity4 troops ' training does not prepare them for situations like this			2
" it 's not their mission to do local law enforcement , " he said			2
but @entity10 and @entity63 agree on another big reason it might make sense to bring in the @entity34 : residents are fed up with police			1
marchers have accused police of responding with disproportionate violence against a mostly peaceful crowd			0
and residents have described protesters helping protect stores from being looted while police did nothing			0
police also infuriated protesters by releasing a video that they said shows @entity24 involved in a convenience store robbery -- even though police themselves have said it does not relate to the police officer having stopped @entity24 as he was walking down the street			0
by bringing in @entity4 troops , @entity27 is moving both @entity5 and @entity138 police out of the way			1
" that might be enough , " @entity63 said			0

@entity6 gov. @entity27 describes the @entity34 's " limited mission "
bringing in the @entity34 is " the opposite extreme , " former @entity1 official @entity10 says
" i 've never seen such a disjointed police effort as this , " he says
simply not being police " might be enough , " says an @entity64 veteran
