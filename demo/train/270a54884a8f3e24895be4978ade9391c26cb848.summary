-- approximately 44 million people live with dementia worldwide , according to the @entity3			2
by 2050 , that number is expected to more than triple to 115 million			0
in the fight against these fast - growing numbers , experts from all over the world discussed the latest research at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , this week			0
here are five things we learned about alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia : hypertension in old age may save your brain high blood pressure is usually called the " silent killer			1
" however , a new study from the @entity25 now suggests that if you 're over 90 , hypertension can save the life of your brain cells			2
hypertension may protect against dementia in people over age 90 , the study authors say			1
the researchers followed 625 participants who developed high blood pressure in their 90s for up to 10 years and found that their risk for dementia was 55 % lower than people without a history of hypertension			1
nevertheless , the study does n't promote hypertension in the elderly , given that high blood pressure is related to other bad outcomes			1
" i do n't think it says if i find somebody who 's doing well at age 90 , whose blood pressure is 120/80 , we should feed them salt to bump their blood pressure up , " says @entity43 , vice chair of the @entity44 and @entity45			1
the study simply shows that when it comes to normal levels of blood pressure , it might not be a one - size - fits - all with respect to age , he says			1
better late than never seniors can lower their risk for late - life cognitive impairment and alzheimer 's disease with a number of lifestyle changes , new research suggests			1
a two - year clinical trial from @entity70 and the @entity71 included 1,260 participants aged 60 to 77			0
one part of the group received a " lifestyle - package , " including nutritional guidance , physical exercise , management of heart health risk factors , cognitive training and social activities			2
the control group received standard health advice			0
after two years , the lifestyle - intervention group did much better in tests of memory and thinking			2
we know from past studies that implementing those lifestyle factors in midlife can hedge against alzheimer 's disease later on , says @entity92 , chairman of the @entity44 and @entity45			1
" the good news from this particular study is that these kind of changes can be implemented in your 60s and 70s			2
" playing games makes your brain bigger middle - aged people who were avid game - players ( think crosswords , checkers , cards ) tended to have bigger brains than people who did not play games , according to a recent study that looked at brain scans			2
" it 's like looking at someone 's muscle mass , " said dr. @entity109 of the @entity110			0
" it 's bad when it 's smaller , good when it 's bigger			0
" researchers looked specifically at certain parts of participants ' brains			0
the volume among game - players was greater in areas that tend to be damaged by alzheimer 's disease , suggesting the potential for delaying -- maybe even avoiding -- the disease			1
people who kept their brains pumped scored higher on tests of their thinking ability			0
@entity132 suggests mixing it up : try potentially stimulating activities like learning a new language or switching from reading nonfiction to fiction -- anything that poses a cognitive challenge			0
exercise benefits the mind too exercise seems to slow the descent toward dementia as well			0
two sets of data from the @entity147 suggest that exercise may positively influence how mild cognitive impairment ( a precursor to dementia ) and dementia develop			0
in one group of patients with mild cognitive impairment , exercising seemed to protect against developing dementia			0
data on a different group of healthy patients who exercised -- either lightly or vigorously -- showed they were less likely to be diagnosed with cognitive impairment			0
" we would never say that these things totally prevent @entity161 's , that they will cure you , " said @entity132 , a geriatrician			1
" but they 're going to help your brain			0
" a smell test may detect @entity161 's in the future , a test of your sense of smell may help doctors predict your risk of developing alzheimer 's disease			1
in two separate studies , scientists found that people who were unable to identify certain odors were more likely to experience cognitive impairment			0
the researchers believe that brain cells crucial to a person 's sense of smell are killed in the early stages of dementia			2
researchers say this information could help doctors create a smell test to detect @entity161 's earlier			1
early detection means early intervention and treatment to slow the progression of the disease			0
doctors today can only diagnose alzheimer 's disease once it has caused significant brain damage			1
" in the face of the growing worldwide @entity161 epidemic , there is a pressing need for simple , less invasive diagnostic tests that will identify the risk of @entity161 's much earlier in the disease process , " @entity203 , director of medical and scientific operations for the @entity3 , said in a statement			1
blood test predicts @entity161 's disease 10 warning signs of @entity161 's @entity0 's @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this story .			1

new : high blood pressure that starts after age 90 linked to lower risk of dementia
new : lifestyle changes , even if started in 60s or 70s , can lower @entity161 's risk
studies show games like checkers can boost your brain *strength*
doctors may use a smell test to detect @entity161 's disease
