in @entity1 , where voters will go to the polls on tuesday , politics can be brutal			2
case in point : the @entity7 primary for the @entity9 seat being vacated by sen. @entity10			1
it 's rough and dirty and personal			2
and , whether it ends tuesday or continues on to a run - off on july 28 , it could blow up all the bridges that @entity7 in @entity1 built over the years to @entity16 voters			1
this is because , in the 11th hour , the primary went down a muddy road			2
that is , if you think that accusing a candidate with a @entity24 surname of favoring " amnesty " for illegal immigrants -- with no evidence to back it up -- is hitting below the belt because it raises questions about divided loyalties and feeds into the perception that all @entity33 favor open borders and unlimited immigration			2
there are those @entity37 who are convinced that @entity33 are working behind lines to help @entity39 reclaim the @entity40 in an elaborate " reconquista			0
" the impact of the ' latino vote ' beyond @entity1 i remember the reader who , sweet as you please , wrote to tell me : " i think most people who read your columns understand that you 're pro-mexican invasion because you 're @entity49			0
" @entity9 candidate @entity51 is not @entity49			1
nor is he @entity49 - @entity37			0
and a funny thing happened to him on his way to @entity55			0
after months of campaigning as a generic , run - of - the - mill , appeal - to - the - base @entity7 , @entity51 was hit by a negative radio ad put up by a super pac that supports his opponent , lt. gov. @entity60			1
the spot claimed that @entity51 supports giving the undocumented a pathway to earned legal status ( " amnesty " in right - wing parlance ) as evidenced by the fact that he sits on the advisory boards of two business groups that support that view			1
the ad charges : " @entity51 helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants			1
" opinion : how @entity76 can win over @entity33 voters that sounds awfully thin			0
i 've known @entity51 for about 10 years , and i could n't tell you what his immigration views are			1
i do know that , during this campaign , he has lurched to the right in order to snuggle up to the tea party and that he said during one interview that he " categorically opposes amnesty			2
" but what does that mean , anyway ? according to polls , most @entity37 oppose amnesty			2
the concept is all about getting something for nothing			0
most of the immigration proposals being bandied about in @entity55 offer something in exchange for something else			0
political ticker : @entity99 endorses @entity51 in @entity101 race for me , the bigger issue is why this accusation was leveled at @entity51 in the first place , let alone in the closing days of the @entity7 primary , when he could n't do much to respond			1
it 's not like the former @entity1 solicitor general and graduate of @entity110 is considered soft on illegal immigration by any means			0
rather , he is pro enforcement with a capital " p. " in fact , while serving as the state 's chief litigator , @entity51 took on the @entity119 administration , the @entity120 , and 90 foreign nations who challenged @entity1 ' right to execute an illegal immigrant who had raped and murdered two teenagers in the state -- and he won			1
so why target @entity51 with this kind of slimy attack ? the only explanation is that someone at the @entity131 cynically thought an accusation of being " pro-amnesty " would be especially explosive aimed at a @entity16 candidate because it feeds into existing prejudices			1
that might well be , but this is short - term thinking			0
i doubt that the strategist thought about the effect an ad like this is likely to have on any hispanics who might be considering voting @entity7			1
it makes it less likely			0
rubio on voter id laws and @entity148 : ' what 's the big deal ? ' that 's what makes this story so perplexing			1
this is @entity1 , after all , where @entity7 ca n't figure out whether they want to reach out to @entity33 voters -- or repel them			1
in one camp , you have republicans like @entity119 , who achieved historic inroads with @entity16 voters both as governor and president and fought members of his own party to open the debate on immigration reform , and @entity167 , who signed a law allowing undocumented students to pay in - state tuition at public colleges and universities and defended that decision on the national stage while running for president			0
in the other camp , you have the folks behind this ad , which could well include @entity60 , who has n't disavowed the spot			1
republicans are n't unified , either on immigration policy or on the need to attract @entity16 voters			2
and they 're not doing themselves any favors with lame stunts like this			2
they only wind up portraying themselves as unfriendly and unwelcoming			0
whereas the @entity7 was once described as a big tent , today the party is more like a private club			1
and there is a guard at the door			0
that 's true in @entity1 , but it 's also true across the country			0
@entity7 have to figure out -- and fast -- whether they see hispanics as a foil or as their future			1
if they want to survive in a country that is becoming more @entity16 by the day , they had better choose the latter			0
follow @ @entity201 on twitter			0

@entity51 , a *conservative* @entity7 , is seeking a @entity9 seat
@entity206 says he was target of unfair ad saying he favors amnesty
*incident* shows *tension* between those who welcome @entity148 , those who do n't , he says
@entity206 : @entity7 must decide whether they see hispanics as a foil or as their future
