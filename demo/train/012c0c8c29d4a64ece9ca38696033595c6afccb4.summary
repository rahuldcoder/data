@entity0 -- it has happened before : @entity3			0
@entity6 but , this time , the @entity7 and a growing number of @entity10 lawmakers on @entity11 promise it will be different			1
this time , they say , things will change			1
in @entity0 and around the country , the legacy left by the 26 people -- 20 of them young children -- slaughtered in a school shooting on friday in @entity17 , @entity18 , might indeed be meaningful legislative reform			1
over the past few days , several lawmakers have promised to introduce or reintroduce gun control legislation , ranging from a reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons to banning the sale of high - capacity magazines			1
on monday , there was a moment of silence on the floor of the @entity32 to honor those killed at @entity34			1
the chamber 's chaplain called on lawmakers to " act promptly			0
" the @entity7 also observed a moment of silence monday evening			0
latest updates out of @entity17 , @entity18 " to me and to others , this one feels different , " said @entity40 , co-director of the @entity41			0
" maybe because of the timing , maybe because of the victims , 20 young children			0
maybe it 's because we have a president who has been re-elected who is not going to be running again			0
that does n't mean those political obstacles are n't still there , but it does feel different			0
" friday , just after the shooting , @entity7 spokesman @entity54 said president @entity56 was willing to consider reinstating the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004			1
on sunday , in his remarks at the vigil in @entity17 , @entity56 hinted that he 'll " use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens ... in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this			1
because what choice do we have ? " on monday , the @entity7 inched closer to addressing what @entity54 called a complex problem			0
and tuesday afternoon , @entity54 said the president now supports sen. @entity71 's intended effort to reinstate the assault weapons ban			1
will @entity17 change @entity74 's attitude toward guns ? pro-gun democrats the most notable shift in tone comes from some conservative democrats who have high rankings from the @entity82 for their pro-gun rights legislative stances			1
friday 's shooting was a " game changer , " tweeted @entity88 @entity10 sen. @entity87 , who 'd previously received an " a " rating from the @entity82			2
" this awful massacre of our youngest children has changed us , and everything should be on the table , " sen. @entity90 , a conservative @entity91 from @entity88 and " proud gun owner , " said monday in a statement			2
" we need to move beyond dialogue -- we need to take a sensible , reasonable approach to the issue of mass violence			0
" @entity105 @entity104 sen. @entity104 plans to reintroduce legislation in the next @entity107 that would prohibit the sale of high - capacity magazines , his office confirmed monday			2
he and @entity112 sen. @entity71 hail from states that advocates of gun control , such as the @entity116 , say have some of the toughest gun restrictions			1
@entity71 announced sunday she 'll reintroduce an assault weapons ban when @entity107 reconvenes in january			1
movement in the @entity7 citizen - created petitions on the @entity7 's website have netted thousands of signatures on both sides of the issue in just a few days			0
but the political reality is that crafting meaningful legislation is a tricky prospect			2
the @entity7 has said @entity56 supports reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons -- a position he took in the 2008 campaign but failed to press during his first term			1
" it does remain a commitment of his , " @entity54 told reporters friday			0
but later that day , an emotional @entity56 did not address the issue directly in a televised statement from the @entity7			1
" we 're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this , regardless of the politics , " said @entity56 , the father of two girls			1
a @entity7 source told @entity1 that on monday afternoon , @entity56 had discussions with @entity7 senior staff , the vice president and several @entity149 members , including education secretary @entity150 , @entity152 secretary @entity151 and attorney general @entity153 to begin looking at ways the country can respond to the tragedy in @entity17			1
the politics of guns @entity56 largely avoided the issue of gun control during his first term			1
he wrote an opinion piece two months after the 2011 assassination attempt on rep. @entity164 of @entity165 , acknowledging the importance of the @entity168 right to bear arms and called for a focus on " effective steps that will actually keep those irresponsible , law - breaking few from getting their hands on a gun in the first place			2
" @entity177 sentenced to life in deadly @entity165 shootings but in the aftermath of that shooting and as the election season loomed , the @entity180 backed off from a list of recommendations that included measure designed to help keep mentally ill people from getting guns			1
there are also other political considerations			0
while @entity10 lawmakers took to the airwaves this weekend to call for congressional action on gun control , the few @entity191 who did speak out pointed to numerous court cases that have upheld @entity168 rights and said guns are needed as mechanisms for self - defense			1
and others have said the solution is more guns in schools , not fewer			1
@entity206 @entity205 rep. @entity205 said on " @entity207 " that if school principal @entity34 had an assault rifle in her office , she could have killed the shooter			1
" i wish to @entity213 she had an m - 4 in her office locked up -- so when she heard gunfire , she pulls it out and she did n't have to lunge heroically with nothing in her hands , " @entity205 said			0
" but she takes him out , takes his head off , before he can kill those precious kids			0
" @entity82 big supporter of politicians protecting those @entity168 rights has also included hefty campaign donations			0
during the 2012 election cycle , the @entity82 donated $ 719,596 to candidates			0
republicans received $ 634,146 of that , according to the @entity229 ' analysis of federal campaign data			2
for example , @entity7 majority leader @entity231 , @entity232 , ranked among the top five recipients , having received $ 7,450 in this cycle			0
some $ 85,450 went to @entity10 , many of them in states that are considered more conservative when it comes to gun control laws			2
for example , @entity10 rep. @entity240 got $ 6,950 this cycle and represents a district in @entity244 , a state gun control policy advocates say has some of the nation 's weakest gun laws			2
a number of @entity10 lawmakers who hail from conservative states are up for re-election in 2014 , which may also increase the pressure not to touch the gun issue			2
analysis : guns and the law gun policies are " still a third rail especially if you 're really going to try and do something about it , " said @entity262 , dean and professor at the @entity264 at @entity266 's @entity265			1
" there are a lot of issues there			0
" according to a new @entity274 / @entity273 survey on gun control conducted over the weekend , 52 % of people see the mass shootings as a sign of broader problems in society			2
this up from 24 % in august shortly after the deadly theater shooting in @entity3 , @entity281			2
the poll also found rise in people who strongly favor stricter gun control , 44 % , and a double - digit gap between them and the 32 % who say they strongly oppose stricter gun control laws			2
in august , 39 % supported tougher laws and 37 % opposed them			0
a @entity291 poll conducted after the @entity164 shooting found that 49 % of @entity74 said it was " more important to protect the rights of @entity74 to own guns , " while 46 % said it was " more important to control gun ownership			1
" but a survey conducted by @entity1 / @entity299 in august shortly after the @entity3 incident found that 76 % of those surveyed believe " there should be some restrictions on owning guns			1
" and as debate is sure to ensue in @entity0 , so it has already online			0
" you can make as many laws as you want it will not change people who want to hurt others			0
we all need to arm our self now			0
that is the only way , " reader @entity312 commented on @entity1			0
which prompted another reader to reply : " that worked so well for the shooter 's mother , did n't it ? " view from abroad : sorrow , but little hope for @entity74 gun control @entity1 's @entity323 and @entity324 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity56 to support @entity71 effort to reinstate assault weapons ban
@entity34 shooting might become a tipping point for gun legislation
several pro-gun democrats have said it is time to look at all options
some republicans say fewer restrictions on guns are what are needed
