@entity1 another @entity0 is poised to confront the seemingly endless challenges of @entity4			1
nearly 25 years after his father launched the first @entity6 and almost 12 years after his brother began a much more contentious sequel , it 's @entity0 's turn to articulate his vision of @entity11 's approach to the @entity12 -- and @entity4 in particular			1
how he responds will have big implications for his @entity15 ambitions			0
on wednesday , he 'll deliver his first foreign policy speech since signaling his serious interest in running for president next year , laying out " how @entity11 can regain its leadership in the world , " according to advanced excerpts of the speech			0
the remarks come as the @entity11 is again being drawn back into the @entity12 , including @entity4 , to combat the brutality of the @entity25			2
the speech will offer @entity0 a chance to show whether his national security views align more with the swaggering interventionism of his brother or the cautious internationalism of his father			1
democrats are vowing to tether him to the controversial decisions of his brother , president @entity34 , who they blame for starting a war in @entity4 on false pretenses and for presiding over a disastrous occupation that cost trillions of dollars , thousands of @entity11 and @entity4 lives and destabilized the region			1
the challenges of addressing his family 's foreign policy legacy are clear to @entity0 , who is already trying to defuse them			1
" i love my father and my brother			0
i admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make , " @entity0 will say according to excerpts of his speech			2
" but i am my own man -- and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences			0
" but he will also project them as a strength , calling himself " lucky to have a father and a brother who have shaped @entity11 's foreign policy from the @entity65			2
" @entity0 is wading into foreign policy at a crucial time , when it appears that public opinion on issues of war could be shifting			1
a new @entity2 poll shows that @entity73 is beginning to pay a price for the lurid execution videos posted by @entity76 and the group 's widening footprint through the @entity12 and @entity79			1
disapproval of @entity73 's management of the @entity76 crisis has climbed from 49 % in late september to 57 % now , potentially providing an opening for republicans to push for tougher foreign policy			1
and @entity0 will slam @entity73 's foreign policy as " inconsistent and indecisive , " pointing out that @entity73 's foreign policy has made the @entity11 less influential despite @entity73 's promise to engage leaders around the world , what @entity0 will dub " the great irony " of @entity73 's presidency , according to excerpts			1
but @entity0 is nevertheless likely to find himself pulled into a debate over conflicts initiated by @entity34 that still vex @entity11 policymakers and remain an open wound in @entity11 politics			2
@entity32 insist they wo n't let @entity0 get away with his pledge to not re-litigate old wars			1
" if you thought @entity34 's foreign policy made the world less safe , then you 're going to really hate @entity0 's approach , " said @entity103 , communications director of the @entity104			2
" even with the benefit of hindsight , he 's one of the few people left who still stands by the decision to rush into a war in @entity4 based on false information , even when it took resources away from the hunt for @entity118 in @entity119			1
and he 's made it pretty clear that if he had his way , we 'd still be in @entity4 and staying there indefinitely			2
" @entity32 believe @entity34 created a mess abroad and voters will not buy attacks on president @entity73 by his brother			1
" the bulk of what we know of @entity0 's foreign policy experience is his steadfast refusal to criticize his brother when his brother was in office , " said @entity127 of the progressive @entity128			1
" on friday , i think you saw him take an unsustainable position			0
that is not how presidential politics works			0
" @entity0 's past statements on his brother 's presidency are already powering the @entity104 attacks			1
" during incredibly challenging times , he kept us safe , " @entity0 said at the @entity143 in 2012			2
in an interview on @entity2 's " @entity148 " in march 2013 , @entity0 said : " the war has wound down now and it 's still way too early to judge what successes it had in providing some degree of stability in the region			1
" a 2010 @entity2 interview in which the @entity0 brothers appeared together could provide democrats even more fodder			2
during the interview , @entity0 said " i have never disagreed with ( @entity34 ) ... ' til death do us part			2
" there are deeper reasons why @entity0 will find it hard to skip a full discussion on @entity4 or @entity119			1
neither war produced a clear - cut @entity11 victory and both nations still face intractable political , military and sectarian challenges , including the rise of @entity76 and the resilience of the @entity173 , which will be among the most pressing foreign challenges for the next president			0
the politics of the @entity4 war , meanwhile , remain toxic , and disputes over the origins of the conflict -- which have never been resolved -- cloud the debate over how to rescue @entity4 from its current plight			1
even people who worked for his brother believe @entity0 needs to address @entity4 soon			1
" there is no question that gov. @entity0 has to talk about @entity4 at some point , " said @entity186 , who was a leading official responsible for @entity4 on @entity34 's @entity187 and is now at @entity188			1
" those questions will be asked of him and he has to have an answer			0
" @entity194 , who also worked as a senior foreign policy aide in the @entity0 administration , agreed			2
" i do think he is in a vulnerable position on @entity4 because of his last name , " she said , conceding that the public perception of the @entity0 legacy on foreign policy was a wider problem for his party , not just @entity0			1
" conservatives , @entity206 have to rebuild public confidence in what we say we are going to do , " said @entity194 , now at the @entity205			0
" that is a high hurdle but it is an achievable hurdle			0
" @entity0 can take several approaches			0
he could argue that avoiding a rehash of the fierce war debate may actually help move the nation on and focus on the best way to tackle @entity76 as it spreads across the @entity12			0
that might be beneficial because the current foreign policy disputes in @entity1 seem still mired in a perpetual blame game			0
" when you ask : ' what is the appropriate @entity11 response to @entity76 ? ' half the people in @entity1 answer : ' @entity34 broke @entity4 and @entity76 was born in the rubble			0
there would be no isis if it were n't for him			0
' " @entity229 wrote in her @entity231 column earlier this month			0
" the other half answer : ' when @entity73 withdrew from @entity4 , @entity76 was born in the vacuum			1
there would be no isis without him			0
' " @entity0 seems to be happy to engage in war talk if it centers on @entity73 's missteps , which may offer him a chance to turn the conversation on @entity4 away from simply yet another fight over his brother 's legacy			1
at the @entity243 earlier this month , @entity0 warned that @entity73 's failure to arm rebels in @entity246 and insufficient attention to @entity4 left a void for jihadism			1
" as we pulled back from the @entity12 , look what happened , " he said			0
" look what happened with @entity76 in @entity246			0
look what happened with @entity76 in @entity4			0
" and on wednesday he will make the case for unapologetic leadership on the world stage coupled with a strong military , " because i believe , fundamentally , that weakness invites war ... and strength encourages piece , " according to excerpts			0
this is hardly the first time @entity4 has emerged as a campaign issue			0
the @entity11 is fighting its third war in the country , if the current campaign against @entity76 is included			0
@entity4 was a key issue in presidential elections in 2004 and 2008			0
it now looks certain that @entity73 will deposit the messy aftermath of the wars onto his successor , meaning they will return to the campaign trail in 2016 .			2

@entity0 does n't want to " re-litigate " old rows over brother 's wars
@entity32 already planning @entity4 war *offensive*
but @entity73 missteps could help @entity206
