the recent video depicting the final words and beheading of @entity4 journalist @entity3 by someone that seems to be a @entity8 foreign fighter has sent shockwaves across the @entity9			1
the video has already been blocked multiple times from various video - sharing platforms , only to reappear as many times , something that once again emphasizes that the new frontline for counter-terrorist practitioners is online extremism			1
labeled as a " message to @entity4 , " the video adds another line of fodder to @entity24 ' tech - savvy and social media - driven propaganda and messaging			1
the scene is filmed on a high quality device with seamless editing of president @entity30 's speech authorizing military action against @entity24 positions , something which it argues led directly to this , @entity24 ' brutal response			2
the answer to why @entity24 -- which refers to itself as the " @entity37 " ( " is " ) -- makes and popularizes such videos is simple : they represent a critical threat to the @entity9 on two levels			2
on the one hand , the video directly warns the @entity9 of repercussions if its intervention continues			0
on the other , it represents a more subtle threat reminding @entity48 and the @entity4 that their own citizens are vulnerable to being radicalized , that @entity24 supporters are present all over the world			1
in the past , most @entity24 propaganda had focused on the development of the caliphate state and on securing territories within @entity57 and @entity58			2
the primary target audience had been @entity57 and @entity58 military forces and militias			0
so , creating an elaborate display of beheading an @entity4 represents a distinct change in messaging , turning the threat towards the @entity9			0
the act is declared as revenge for @entity4 air strikes against @entity24 fighters in @entity58			1
indeed , the apparently @entity8 militant conducting the beheading addresses @entity30 directly , declaring that any attempt " to deny @entity73 liberty and safety under the @entity76 caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people			0
" clearly , here @entity24 is attempting to strip @entity4 intervention down to the rudimentary " us versus them rhetoric " -- depicting the @entity9 , and specifically @entity4 , as a force that is continually trying to oppress @entity73 the world over			1
in the @entity90 , " @entity89 , " @entity88 are referred to as " @entity91 , " linking present day events with historical events where @entity94 ( predominantly , but not exclusively , from the @entity9 ) have targeted @entity73			0
as such , the @entity4 decision to commence military action in @entity58 based on humanitarian concerns , without the equivalent military intervention of other @entity100 political powers has played into @entity24 rhetoric against @entity4			1
@entity24 knows that @entity4 military action is unlikely to change based on one video			1
however , by making this threat and demanding that the @entity4 stop military interference in the region , @entity24 gives itself justification for direct action against @entity4 hostages and potentially justifies action against the @entity4 directly			1
opinion : beheading video poses challenge for social media using an apparently @entity8 foreign fighter to carry out the beheading in the @entity3 execution video was a deliberate act perpetrated in order to create the maximum impact and gain as much @entity122 attention as possible			1
the use of what seems to be a native english - speaker in the video forces @entity122 viewers to recognize an individual who has wholeheartedly rejected his past , and who is committed to @entity24 ' cause -- willing to carry out the most abhorrent acts of violence in the name of its political program			1
@entity122 governments face an ongoing threat that their citizens will become radicalized and go abroad to fight in @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity140 , a fellow at the @entity141 for @entity142 , estimates that almost 3,000 foreign fighters have left @entity122 countries to fight in @entity57			0
this is an unprecedented number , already far surpassing the number that left to fight in @entity147 during the previous 10 - year conflict			0
the success of @entity24 in promoting their cause and attracting fighters from abroad is a combination of an advanced social media strategy paired with a lack of counter-narratives			0
while @entity24 supporters handing out leaflets on @entity161 streets may gain more media attention , it is @entity24 ' online presence that is its most powerful recruitment tool			1
@entity24 has been a game - changer in terms of using @entity167 , @entity168 and its own online apps to engage with potential recruits , promote its victories and antagonize its perceived enemies			2
@entity167 feeds regularly depict an idealized image of a 5 - star jihad to draw in young potential jihadists , often mentioning the availability of young local women who are marrying @entity24 fighters			0
these same feeds also boast of " spoils " -- military weaponry and vehicles won in battle			0
violence towards the enemy is also a common theme , largely because it threatens those willing to stand up to @entity24 , something that cultivates intrinsic fear in future military and paramilitary personnel attempting to face the group			2
right now , we are woefully lacking in both online and offline content that stands up against @entity24 messaging			2
@entity197 needs to come from moderate theologians explaining why @entity76 does not condone the use of violence			0
other community voices must be louder in their arguments against the validity of a caliphate state			0
finally , governments must give a clear message about why they are intervening militarily in some areas , like @entity58 , but unwilling to act in others , like @entity57			0
the extremist minority is exceptionally vocal and continues to overwhelm discourse on the validity of @entity24 and its actions , particularly online			2
only by empowering and activating the vast moderate majority can we turn the tide against @entity24			1
would you watch the video ?			0
