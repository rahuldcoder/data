-- when @entity2 speaks , you listen			1
and his advice , if you want to be the best club in the world , is : never , ever sell your best players			0
" i believe a very important point in our history came in 2008 , " @entity2 , a legend in @entity8 football and executive board chairman of the all - conquering @entity10 , told @entity0			1
" we received big offers from @entity21 and @entity22 for the transfer of @entity24 to big clubs and we decided not to accept , " added the 58 - year - old , referring to an official bid from @entity16 and an inquiry from @entity18 for the player who had cost @entity10 $ 40 million in 2007			1
" that was very important			0
i believe because from that point onwards all clubs in @entity28 understood that @entity10 was not a selling club			2
it 's a buying club and that 's it			0
" @entity2 is all too conscious that it could have been so very different for his beloved @entity10 , where he spent the first decade of his senior playing career and won numerous honors			1
back in 2004 , the @entity36 finished second in the @entity37 behind @entity38 and were knocked out of the @entity39 in the last - 16 by @entity18			0
not since 2001 had @entity10 lifted @entity28 's most coveted trophy , as teams from the @entity45 , @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity22 's @entity42 dominated			2
for a club that enjoyed such glorious years in @entity39 football between 1974 - 76 , winning the title on three consecutive occasions , the prospect of being left behind by the continent 's elite was frightening			1
@entity2 -- who played in the 1976 success and was an unused substitute in the previous year 's final -- was all too aware of @entity10 's precarious position			1
it was n't just the interest other more avaricious clubs had in @entity10 's leading players ; the new money flooding into @entity62 football also potentially threatened the @entity8 ' status			1
" about 10 years ago i thought we had no chance when gentlemen from @entity73 and from the @entity75 countries came into the business , " said @entity2 , referring to the various takeovers of major @entity62 clubs by @entity67 groups and also @entity69 's investment in @entity21 's @entity16			1
" then we found a very good philosophy at the club -- being a bit patient , and buying good players			0
" the story began in 2007 when we bought @entity24 , @entity82 ... and we continue this story to today			0
" a buying club indeed -- @entity10 has become a @entity62 power to rival @entity86 and @entity18 by attracting some of the world 's top players			1
that it is able to do so owes much to the commercial model @entity2 has created along with club president @entity91			2
helped by the presence of so many of its great players on the board , @entity10 is a club which understands not just what happens on the pitch , but off it too			2
according to the @entity98 money report , @entity10 is the third richest club in the world , with its revenue growing by 17 % over the past year to $ 592 million			2
it is the first time in 11 years that @entity10 has been in the top three of the @entity103 and comes following a @entity39 triumph from which it gained a 31 % increase in broadcast revenue			0
its average home attendances of 71,000 led to matchday revenue of $ 4.6 million -- more than any other @entity37 club and less than only four others in @entity28			2
commercial revenue , merchandise , sponsorship and advertising have all increased markedly , while deals with partners have also boosted the coffers			0
extensions to deals with @entity120 and @entity121 , on top of the club 's longstanding partnerships with @entity125 and @entity126 , which holds the naming rights to the stadium , have put @entity10 miles ahead of its domestic rivals			1
that is part of the reason why it has been able to raid the likes of @entity136 for talents such as @entity138 , who joined at the start of this season , and @entity141 , who will arrive in @entity142 when it finishes			0
" that is not our will , " @entity2 says when asked about poaching from rival clubs			0
" our will is where you find the best players in the @entity8 @entity37			1
in @entity21 it 's not different that the big clubs like @entity16 , @entity154 are interested especially in players from @entity156 , from @entity157 and so on			0
i believe that is the normality of the business			0
" such is the talent at @entity10 that @entity163 , who took over from treble - winning coach @entity164 at the end of last season , was able to name @entity168 internationals such as @entity169 and @entity170 as substitutes for last week 's 2 - 0 win at @entity156 in the @entity39			2
already 19 points clear at the top of the @entity37 , unbeaten in 47 league games , @entity10 looks set to win a record 24th championship without much hassle			1
sunday 's 4 - 0 victory over @entity179 -- its 14th successive league win -- means only an absolute disaster can prevent @entity10 from coasting to a successful title defense , making @entity136 's two - season reign seem long ago			1
even more impressive is that @entity10 's fans can enjoy this success while paying prices which @entity45 counterparts could only dream of			2
@entity10 's 225,000 members hold an 82 % share of the club , and @entity191 has made football accessible to all supporters with some season tickets available for just over $ 200			1
indeed , the low - cost deals offered by all @entity37 teams are the envy of many within the @entity62 game			1
@entity10 , the 2013 @entity201 champion , is seeking to extend its dominance and will reportedly open the club 's first overseas office in @entity205 from april 1 to help break into the @entity208 market			1
@entity163 's team will begin a @entity211 tour in late july , including a match against the @entity215 all - star lineup			0
under the guidance of the @entity218 , the possibilities appear endless for @entity10 -- a heavy favorite to become the first team to retain the @entity62 title since the advent of the @entity39 in 1992			1
it makes @entity10 's acquisition of the former @entity86 coach even more frightening for those who are trying to compete within the same sphere			2
" from the very first meeting , i had a feeling that he was something special , " @entity2 said of @entity163			0
obsessed by football in a very , very nice and good way			0
when i talked to our players six months ago they said this guy does n't stop our success story			0
this guy brings us ahead			0
" if they move any further ahead , then the others will only look on with fear .			0

@entity10 chairman @entity2 opens up to @entity0
reveals his fears that @entity8 team would slip from football elite
he says club 's *refusal* to sell @entity24 was *pivotal* moment
