-- i knot my black tie carefully			1
i have n't worn it since my grandmother 's funeral			1
i check my reflection in the shop windows near @entity8 as i walk towards the chapel where my " other mother " lies in her coffin			1
for five years , i 've been writing " @entity16 , " my memoir of surviving @entity14 's 11 years in power			1
i feel surprisingly protective or perhaps possessive about my relationship with the woman we called @entity20			1
she privatized my fractured family into poverty by closing the steelworks where my dad toiled and cutting my mother 's disability benefits , all while not seeming to care about any of it			1
and yet , as my family descended into chaos and eventually abuse , @entity20 was always there in some sense ; always encouraging me to get an education , to get away , to be an individual			1
at 9am on the dot , i find a place right opposite @entity37 near @entity38			2
i will see her hearse as it leaves the scene of her greatest political battles			1
at this time in the morning , there are more police than observers on the scene			2
they 've been on duty since 5am but remain good - humored			2
there are sniffer dogs and through the drizzle we catch flashes of color amidst the crenelations of parliament -- snipers on the roof			1

people who have to get to work are annoyed that the road is closed and they have to walk the long way round			2
a young woman , dressed entirely in cobalt blue from shoes to headscarf , joins my prime spot			2
she looks like a @entity72 nun			2
much fuss has been made about granting permission for protest but i come across only two placards and these are about the Â £ 10 million cost of the funeral			2
it 's hard to see where this vast sum has been spent			2
there 's no sign of bread , nor circuses			0
i am here to close not just a chapter of my life but a whole book			1
at various points , @entity20 turned her back on me but i wo n't do that to her today			1
" i would n't give her the satisfaction , " i think to myself , and i feel oddly nostalgic			1
there 's a definite sense of loss			0
or is it release ? grief or relief ? maybe both			0
when @entity101 leader @entity100 died i was heartbroken and this is certainly not that			0
but i do have some things to thank her for			0
i feel determined to show her at least some of the respect in death that she did n't show me , my family , or my community in life			1
so i stand with dignity as a small crowd forms			0
the usual anti-war protesters are seated on their chairs with signs			0
i wonder if they are glad to have a bigger audience or feel infringed upon ? read more : how life might have been without @entity14 it 's 9:45am now , and @entity37 bongs while he can			1
" is this the bell which summons me to heaven or to hell ? " i wonder			0
now the police seem to be multiplying in force			0
i see three soldiers in desert fatigues with green berets on			0
a brown - and - white spaniel sniffer dog is off the leash			0
" it 's a moment in history is n't it ? " says a young @entity132 woman officer to a lady from @entity134			1
with ten minutes ' til the top of the hour , a helicopter appears overhead			0
at exactly 10am , and with surprising speed , @entity20 's hearse , flanked by half a dozen police on bikes , exits the chapel at @entity8			1
she 's punctual and impatient in death as in life , i think			0
@entity37 stays silent but the @entity38 bells peal incongruously			0
people tutt loudly at this			0
there are more police than mourners -- their backs facing the coffin , not in protest but so they can keep their eyes on us			1
there are no jeers , or tears			0
the small crowd starts to shuffle off and a prim pensioner bustles up expectantly only to be told she 's too late			0
an impossibly young constable smiles his best consoling smile and says " you 've missed her , madam			0
" gone but not forgotten			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity172 has written a book on the @entity14 years -- " @entity16 "
@entity14 " privatized his family into poverty , " he says
he watches her hearse go by to show her the respect he says she did n't show him
