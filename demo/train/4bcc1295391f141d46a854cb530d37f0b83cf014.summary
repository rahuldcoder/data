@entity0 -- radioactive iodine in seawater around the @entity7 nuclear power plant dropped sharply even before workers plugged a water leak believed to be from its crippled no. 2 reactor , the plant 's owner said wednesday night			1
stopping the flow of highly radioactive water into the @entity14 was a key victory for workers who have struggled to keep the earthquake - damaged plant 's reactors from overheating for nearly four weeks			1
but the @entity20 and a top @entity22 official warned the fight was far from over			1
concentrations of iodine - 131 had been as high as 7.5 million times legal standards in water directly behind the plant after the leak was discovered saturday			1
they had dropped to less than 4 percent of that amount in the 24 hours before the leak had been cut off wednesday morning , according to figures released by @entity20			1
the level remained 280,000 times higher than the legal limit , but those concentrations were dropping sharply as the water flowed out into the @entity14			1
levels of longer - lived @entity38 were down sharply as well but remained 61,000 times the legal standard , according to @entity20 's water sampling data			1
samples from a monitoring point 20 kilometers ( 12.5 miles ) southeast of the plant found iodine - 131 levels down to 1.5 times legal levels , with no reading for cesium			2
@entity22 authorities said they believe the leaking water was part of the 8 metric tons ( 2,100 gallons ) per hour being pumped in the no. 2 reactor , one of three that suffered core damage after the massive earthquake that struck northern @entity22 on march 11			2
the water has been leaking into the basement of the unit 's turbine plant , carrying with it radioactive particles that are the byproduct of nuclear reactors			1
until wednesday , the fluid was pouring into the ocean from a cracked concrete shaft near the turbine plant 's water intake			2
workers managed to use a silica - based polymer dubbed " liquid glass " to seal the breach wednesday morning , but the @entity22 government 's top spokesman on the crisis said government and utility officials had other problems			0
" is it completely stopped ? are there any other areas where ( radioactive ) water is being released ? " said chief cabinet secretary @entity80 , the spokesman			1
" we can not be optimistic , just because we were able to plug this one			1
" @entity86 of @entity22 's @entity87 said the now - contained water " may lead to more leakage somewhere else			2
" @entity20 began pumping nonflammable nitrogen into the primary containment vessel around reactor no. 1 early thursday in what it said was a precautionary measure to counteract a possible buildup of hydrogen			1
" the possibility of a hydrogen explosion is extremely low , " the company announced wednesday night			2
" but more hydrogen could eventually develop in the containment vessel			2
" hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheating fuel rods and can cause explosions like the spectacular blasts that blew the roofs off the no 1 and no. 3 reactor buildings in the days after the march 11 earthquake			1
but @entity20 said it did not believe an explosion was imminent			0
the radioactive cores of units 1 - 3 were damaged when the tsunami that followed the earthquake flooded the plant , knocking out power to its coolant systems and disabling backup generators needed to restore electricity			1
engineers responded by pumping water into the reactors from outside to stave off a feared meltdown , but they are now struggling with what to do with thousands of tons of now - contaminated liquid			2
since monday night , the plant has been discharging nearly 10,000 tons of less radioactive water into the ocean , largely to make room in a waste treatment reservoir for the supercharged coolant leaking from the no. 2 reactor			1
" right now they have no systems available to them for processing liquid rad waste , and they 're generating liquid rad waste at the rate of about 400,000 gallons a day , " said @entity135 , a former nuclear power plant operator			0
" so without any doubt whatsoever , if they do n't put in place some systems to handle this , they are going to have to continue dumping the water into the ocean			2
" @entity20 had released about three - quarters of the water -- which also came from the subdrains below reactors 5 and 6 -- by wednesday night and had reduced its estimate of how much was being dumped from the treatment facility			0
but the discharge , which @entity22 officials called an emergency measure , drew protests from neighboring @entity158 and enraged the country 's fishermen			0
@entity80 said wednesday that the move was " unavoidable " and would minimize harm to the environment			0
but he told reporters , " we should have reported ( more information ) to the people who may be concerned , especially to the neighboring countries			0
" " it was a measure to prevent more serious marine contamination , but we needed to explain the reasoning better , " he said			0
members of @entity22 's fishery association voiced their ire in a wednesday morning meeting with @entity20 officials , complaining that they had argued against the measure beforehand and were not told until later that the process would begin			0
@entity80 said the @entity22 government is considering " provisional compensation " to give a more immediate boost to fishermen , ahead of a more final payment plan that may be established in the future			0
experts have said the releases likely wo n't pose any long - term health risks to humans or sea life			0
it also helps that most of the radiatioactive particles detected are iodine - 131 , which loses half its radiation every eight days			0
the emergency discharge equates to about five swimming pools , compared to " about 300 trillion swimming pools of water " that fill the @entity14 , said @entity197 , chairman of the radiation safety committee at @entity199			1
" so hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly			0
" after a tumultuous first few weeks , utility and government officials have described conditions recently in the plant 's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools as generally stable			0
levels of airborne radiation nearby and further away , meanwhile , steadily have been declining			0
still , the existence of significant amounts of collected radioactive water around the facility suggests that there may be other leaks -- and other problems			1
