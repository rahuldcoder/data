@entity0 -- a day before the @entity3 observes @entity4 , park rangers placed wreaths at the @entity0 memorial honoring the civil rights leader			1
members of @entity10 's family stood beside the towering 30 - foot statue of him as crowds sang " @entity14 " at a ceremony sunday			1
" we 're celebrating the best of what we are , but also what we must become , knowing that we 've not arrived there yet , " @entity10 said			2
the civil rights leader 's son said his father would have turned 83 sunday , if he had survived the 1968 shooting that killed him			1
on his last birthday , in january 1968 , @entity24 was planning a " poor people 's campaign " to bring together @entity3 from all walks of life to demand " decent jobs with decent pay , " his son said			1
" he did not live to see that come to fruition , and so , 44 years later , we 're still challenging our nation , particularly in light of the fact that there 's so much poverty rampant in this nation , " @entity10 said			2
among the many visitors at the memorial was @entity41 , from @entity42 , @entity43 , who had traveled to @entity0 with a boy scout troop			0
" he brought beautiful things to our country , " he said about the elder king			0
" he ... was a monument ... so all the tributes that we can give him are certainly just			2
" the @entity24 memorial in @entity0 opened to the public last year			2
sunday 's ceremony came several days after officials confirmed that a controversial quote on one side of the monument would be corrected			1
the line currently reads : " i was a drum major for justice , peace and righteousness			0
" the quote , which holds a prominent place among more than a dozen @entity10 's most notable lines at the site , sparked controversy last summer when poet @entity69 said it made the civil rights leader appear arrogant			1
@entity10 's original words , from a 1968 sermon at @entity73 in @entity74 , were : " if you want to say that i was a drum major , say that i was a drum major for justice			1
say that i was a drum major for peace			0
i was a drum major for righteousness			0
and all of the other shallow things will not matter			0
" photos : remembering @entity24 at his home church @entity69 said that leaving out the " if " changes the meaning			0
interior secretary @entity92 has given the @entity93 30 days to consult with the @entity94 , members of the @entity10 family and others to decide on a more accurate version of the quote , an official at the @entity88 said last week			1
@entity10 's son said sunday that he supported the move , because future generations may not know the context of the quote			1
" the context is what i think people have questioned , and understanding and knowing who my father was , it could be confusing			0
for us today , no , but for generations yet unborn , they may not understand , " he said			0
" but i 'm sure that when this is done , that everyone who comes will understand who and what @entity24 meant in terms of what he said about himself			0

" he ... was a monument , " a visitor says about the civil rights leader
