the @entity6 government provides protection , not private security companies , @entity22 said			2
known as special protection units , these guards operate only in specific areas , and so aid workers must change vehicles and switch guards when they cross from one region to the next , he said			1
" what happened was that one of the guards , he was sold out , and he had as a mission : to capture expatriates , " @entity22 said			0
the kidnappers paid off one officer , who replaced the regular guards with others who were in on the corruption , he said			0
" and as they came close to the changeover position , then they were stopped , and then they were moved into other vehicles and they were driven away , " he said			0
meanwhile , the @entity10 military said that the two rescued aid workers need time out of the media spotlight to recover			1
the workers ' health and welfare are the top priority , the military statement said , appealing to journalists to respect the privacy of the freed hostages and their families			2
" it is extremely important that they have the chance to decompress from this event without the pressure of instant overwhelming public notoriety , " it said			0
in a joint statement issued through the @entity19 , @entity11 's and @entity17 's families expressed relief the two were rescued unharmed			1
" we are grateful for all the efforts that have been put into getting them safely back to us and for the fact that a very difficult chapter in our lives is over , " it said			0
" we need to look ahead now , and it is going to take time for us all to adjust and to return to normal life			1
we would like to thank all media for having respected our needs for privacy , and we request for everyone to continue to show us this respect and to give us time and privacy , which is all we need now			0
" the reintegration process allows the @entity99 to gather critical information while taking care of the freed captives , the military said			1
" the process ensures returnees have the best chance to return to their previous lives following this significant event , " it said			2
the two hostages were freed in a dramatic overnight rescue operation			2
@entity10 special operations forces parachuted into @entity6 from airplanes early wednesday , advanced on foot to a compound where the two kidnapped workers were being held and then freed them , @entity10 officials said			1
the nine gunmen holding the hostages were killed , officials said			0
the kidnappers seized @entity11 and @entity17 on october 25 in the central @entity6 town of @entity122 after they visited humanitarian projects there , the @entity19 said			1
neither was harmed , the aid group said			0
@entity11 's father , @entity126 , was to go to @entity15 to see her , @entity1 learned			1

@entity6 's transitional government welcomed the @entity10 military operation			1
the rescue " is a great joy to the @entity6 government and to all @entity6 as well as to all right thinking people everywhere , " the government said in a statement			2
" hitting them hard is the only language kidnappers of innocent people , pirates and terrorists understand , and every opportunity should be taken to wipe out this scourge from our country			0
" the new @entity147 envoy to @entity6 -- the first permanent @entity147 representative there in 17 years -- also expressed understanding about the military operation			2

" she was overjoyed when she told us what happened , " @entity160 said , speaking of the daughter who gave them the news			0
the @entity169 unit that killed @entity170 last year in @entity171 participated in the rescue mission , a @entity10 official said , without specifying whether any of the same individuals were on both assaults			1
the @entity169 are part of the @entity177 , formerly known as @entity177			0
the area where the hostages were seized is known as a hub for pirates , rather than an area of @entity184 militant activity			0
@entity185 , a website that tracks piracy statistics , said more than $ 150 million was paid out in ransoms in 2011			0
successful pirate attacks on merchant vessels began to drop off in 2011 in face of improved shipping security -- including on board armed security detachments -- and stronger action from the foreign navies patrolling the @entity196 and @entity197			0
the @entity198 , which tracks piracy , said the number of attacks had risen but the success rate had plummeted to 12 % in the first nine months of 2011			0
