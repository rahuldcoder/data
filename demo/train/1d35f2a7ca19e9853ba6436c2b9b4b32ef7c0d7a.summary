-- honesty is often a rare virtue at the highest level of sport , especially when it comes to admitting mistakes , so @entity8 fans may give @entity9 some begrudging respect after the team principal accepted responsibility for a catalog of errors this season			1
the @entity17 - based constructor may have won twelve drivers ' championships since its creation in 1963 but none will be added in the year of @entity8 's 50th anniversary			1
neither @entity23 nor @entity24 have managed to stand on the podium all season , with the @entity28 's fifth place in the third race in @entity30 the best finish so far			1
@entity32 @entity24 , 23 , has won 18 points in his first season with @entity8 while @entity23 , who won the 2009 title with @entity36 , can only muster 47 , trailing leader @entity37 by 150 points -- or the equivalent of six race victories with just eight rounds left			1
the problem is that @entity8 are currently on course for their first season without a grand prix win in seven years			1
a number of hasty changes to the car have made racing this year both " painful and difficult " for @entity9 as he revealed in an open interview with @entity53 's official website			1
" this year we have made some big mistakes -- that is very obvious , and difficult to rectify , " the @entity28 said			1
" i do n't like it , but there is no point in hiding from it			0
" the 55 - year - old traces the roots of the problems back to the middle of last season , when @entity8 dropped off the pace after a bright start			1
at this point , the car was redesigned , with significant changes to the height of the nose , the configuration of both the front and rear suspensions , as well as the bodywork and exhaust layout			0
" in a word , we did too many things which were deviating from a car which was the fastest car about nine or ten months ago , " the @entity8 official said			2
" the start of the 2012 was good , but then in mid-season we were falling behind and it is about that time that you make these decisions -- and then last year 's car became quicker and quicker			2
" it was bad timing , it was misjudgment , and it was ambition			0
it is very clear in hindsight that we 've got it wrong			0
but let 's also be fair : this car is now quicker than last year 's car			0
" nonetheless , it is still struggling to make any impact in the constructors ' standings , with 11 races of the 19 - round season having already gone			0
@entity8 's tally of 65 points is almost tripled by the team immediately above them in the standings , fourth - placed @entity108 , while the @entity111 outfit 's total is dwarfed by the 312 boasted by @entity112 , who lead the way			2
when asked who should carry the can for the failed redesign of the car , @entity9 resisted any temptation to seek out scapegoats			2
" ultimately i take the blame for it , " he said			0
" i am happy to name names when we are successful and give them the opportunity to stand on the podium , but it is my job when things have n't gone so well to take the responsibility			0
" critics of @entity9 , who has been with @entity8 for a quarter of a century , will point to the team 's inability to win a championship since he replaced the retiring @entity136 in 2009 , a year after the team 's last championship title			1
the closest @entity8 came to a championship under his control was in 2010 when @entity141 had a chance of winning the title on the final day of the season , only for @entity37 to take the glory			2
there has been some good news for @entity9 this week though			2
at sunday 's @entity148 , @entity23 felt the car performed the best it had all season with the @entity28 , 33 , also publicly stating in recent days how he hopes to sign a new three - year contract with the team			1
@entity9 had considered trying to lure @entity153 , who has been in great form this year , back to @entity8 for next season , revealing that talks last year to the same effect failed " for various reasons "			1
however , he also feels he owes the current stable a car that will enable them to challenge far higher up the table			0
" we have n't given our drivers the car we should have done this year			0
but they 've been fantastic ambassadors and i think they deserve another go with us next year			2
" if we give them a car that is good enough , they both can win			0
" and having had a front row seat for more than 100 of @entity8 's 182 grand prix wins , @entity9 is confident that the team can turn itself around ahead of the 2014 season			1
" looking over the last 20 years , we are pretty consistent , " he rallied			0
" yes , this is a bad year but usually we come back strong -- and that is what we will do next year			0
