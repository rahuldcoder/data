i have an uncle who has always been a robust and healthy guy			2
he drank a glass of skim milk every day , bragged about how many pull - ups he was doing and fit into pants he was wearing 20 years before			2
he did n't take a single medication and retired early			1
given that he had no medical problems and ran his own business , he opted to go several years without health insurance			1
eventually , when he turned 65 , he picked up @entity10			2
what happened next was a little strange			2
he fell off the wagon			0
he exercised only sporadically , and paid hardly any attention to what he was eating			0
one day , i saw him eat an entire bag of potato chips			0
he bemoaned the fact that he was forced to buy new , bigger pants , and he stopped drinking his milk			0
for him , becoming newly insured had nearly the opposite effect on him of what we doctors hope to achieve			0
in many ways , my uncle was demonstrating a concept known as the moral hazard			1
two economists wrote about this exact scenario in 2006 they found that many men , at the time they obtained @entity10 , started behaving badly			1
moral , or morale , hazard is a term largely used by economists to describe the actions of people more willing to take risks because they are insulated from the cost of their actions , in this case because of their recently obtained health insurance			1
in the case of these men , when they got @entity10 , they took worse care of themselves ; they actually exercised less			0
among those who did n't visit the doctor after getting insurance , the effect was dramatic : their overall physical activity dropped by 40 % ; they were 16 % more likely to smoke cigarettes and 32 % more likely to drink alcohol			1
even if that seems extreme , it 's still worth asking : does health insurance make us healthier ? the past five years have seen a tumultuous battle over @entity63 , or the @entity63 , culminating in the bitter recriminations this fall over lost policies and the disastrous launch of the @entity68 website			1
when i interviewed @entity72 secretary @entity71 at the end of october , she downplayed the concerns and seemed certain the site would be up and running by the end of november			0
the website may be working better now , but to me that 's not the most important issue			1
in my mind , the real suspense comes from whether @entity63 will really make us a healthier @entity82 , even if it succeeds in its ambitions to dramatically expand coverage			1
a healthier @entity82 : that is the goal we should share as @entity82 , but access alone wo n't get us anywhere close			1
this past spring , the @entity86 followed up on an important experiment in @entity88			0
the state created a remarkable strategy to do a minimal expansion of @entity92			0
it decided to conduct random lottery drawings to allocate the limited spots			0
while it was controversial in its implementation , the situation was a goldmine for researchers			0
it offered something very rare in these types of studies : a unique opportunity for researchers to compare the newly insured to their highly similar counterparts , who remained uninsured			0
the results were surprising , and mostly disappointing			0
the newly insured @entity92 population did go to the doctor more often , used more preventive health services and received more medications			1
problem was , in nearly every area , they were n't any healthier			1
the scientists sat down with more than 12,000 people and compared some of the most important health indicators			1
they found having insurance did not improve measures of blood pressure , cholesterol or how well diabetics controlled their blood sugar			2
furthermore , the 10 - year risk of having a heart attack did n't change in those who had @entity92			1
it was n't at all what the proponents of universal access to health insurance hoped they would see			1
the results remind me of a column i wrote a few years ago , shortly after my own marriage			0
it seemed like a good time to explore the question of whether marriage was in fact good for one 's health			1
i spent a fair amount of time researching the topic and one of the experts i interviewed gave me an answer i have never forgotten : marriage is good for your health ( long pause ) ... as long as it 's a good marriage			1
it was a terrific answer , and a metaphor for so many aspects of our lives			0
as you might imagine , i had quite a bit of fun with that article on marriage , but it taught an important lesson			0
there is almost always a second beat to any story			0
being married all by itself is n't necessarily good or bad for your health			1
it was the effort required to make it a good or bad marriage that made up the entire difference			2
the same can be said about health insurance			1
in this case , i do n't mean that " good " or " bad " insurance is the critical factor , but that health insurance alone does n't lead to better health			1
none of this works unless we all take personal responsibility , and hold ourselves accountable			2
to be clear , there will always be some baseline benefit to being insured versus not being insured , even if you account for the moral hazard			1
a major @entity189 report in 2009 found that uninsured adults are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of cancer , more likely to die from a heart attack and less likely to recover from a serious injury			1
even in @entity88 , the newly insured enjoyed some benefits			0
for example , they were nearly a third less likely to suffer from depression , perhaps because they had more peace of mind from being insured			0
and there were significant benefits in nonmedical areas : whereas more than 5 % of the uninsured faced " catastrophic " medical expenses in a year -- defined as greater than 30 % of their income -- those catastrophic expenses were virtually eliminated in the group on @entity92			2
but strictly in terms of health , insurance , like marriage , does n't guarantee good health			1
after all , i am sure you can think of people right now who have terrific health insurance and terrible health			1
it seems the benefits pale in comparison to what we can gain with a few simple personal decisions about our health			1
a good example comes from a study in the journal @entity233			2
researchers estimated that if all @entity82 exercised 30 minutes a day , we would reduce the number of cardiovascular events -- heart attacks and strokes -- by a third			1
a third ! just 30 minutes a day , and suddenly we are starting to get serious about a more healthy @entity82			1
you can break up the exercise into 10 - minute chunks , according to the @entity244 , and you do n't even have to knock yourself out			1
just go hard enough that your breathing is slightly labored , enough that it would keep you from singing if you suddenly got the urge			0
problem is that as things stand now , only half of us , at most , exercise that much			2
while we are fond of comparing ourselves to @entity253 , a place that was ranked as having the best overall health care system in 2000 , according to the @entity256 , there 's a huge difference between the @entity82 and @entity253 that has little to do with the health care safety net			1
we @entity82 are three times as likely to be obese as the average @entity253 person -- and obesity is related to just about every chronic disease imaginable			0
i think about this all the time , and here is what i tell my own patients			2
it is time to stop merely playing defense when it comes to your health , and time to start optimizing yourself			1
yes , of course we are desperate to stamp out disease when it occurs , but we are more desperate for those diseases to never occur in the first place			0
i say that as a neurosurgeon , someone who is often called in to extinguish the brightest of fires			0
i also say this , however , as a 44 - year - old dad who wants to be around for a long time			2
i have been fortunate to have always had health insurance , but a few years ago , i decided to strive for something more			1
i wanted to optimize myself			0
i wanted to be the best that i could possibly be , instead of waiting around for the seemingly inevitable diagnosis of heart disease or diabetes			2
i found that it was n't that hard			2
i became diligent about breaking a sweat every day			0
i made it as important as a meeting with my boss or a dinner date with my wife			0
also , as a student of neuroscience , i know the brain is n't particularly good at distinguishing thirst and hunger ; so most people eat when they should drink			1
as a result we walk around overstuffed and dehydrated			0
drinking fluids all day long has cut my calorie consumption by a third			0
studies of the mind - body connection also remind us that it takes about 15 - 20 minutes for the brain to know the stomach is full			2
stop eating when you are 80 % full , and you will likely take in the right number of calories			2
the @entity313 call it hara hachi bu			0
to help , we use smaller plates in our home to trick the brain into believing we are eating more			0
we eat meat occasionally , but no longer serve it in our home			0
i eat seven different colored foods a day , and try to buy locally grown vegetables whenever i can			0
these are simple strategies that have made me biologically younger than i was nearly five years ago			0
at 44 , i have the biological age of someone in his mid- 30s			0
it is true that the @entity326 supports the aspects of @entity63 that expand insurance coverage , as do many others in the medical community , even if they are n't convinced that it will reliably lead to better health			1
it appeals to a sense of justice , and a desire to prevent the awful situation of people being turned away when they need help the most			0
but , as we follow the story of @entity63 over the coming years , it 's important to understand and agree on the true measure of success			1
as a doctor , i think a healthier @entity82 is the rallying cry we can all get behind			0
we have had a rocky , yet still vitally important start , but the point is that access to health care insurance is not nearly enough			1
if we are serious about a more healthy @entity82 , the real change starts in each and every one of us , and it 's not that hard to do .			2

@entity352 : moral hazard causes some to neglect health when they get health insurance
he says @entity63 alone wo n't guarantee good health ; personal habits must do that
he says research shows 30 minutes of daily exercise cuts heart attack , stroke risk by a third
@entity352 : it 's time to stop playing defense on your health ; instead , start optimizing it yourself
