-- my eyes stung , i was coughing , my nose was running			0
along with cameraman @entity4 and freelance producer @entity5 , i had just been tear - gassed -- not for the first time last friday -- during a day - long clash between @entity9 kids and @entity11 soldiers in the @entity13 town of @entity14 , on the @entity13			1
an @entity11 soldier confronts @entity9 protesters during a demonstration friday in the @entity13 village of @entity19			1
we had gone there to gauge the @entity9 view of tuesday 's @entity11 elections			1
@entity14 , and many other towns and villages like it in the @entity13 , are in the forefront of the conflict between @entity11 and the @entity9			1
here , it all comes down to the most basic element in the century - old conflict : control of the land			0
@entity14 is an old town , with factories and workshops , surrounded by olive groves			0
but in recent years neighboring @entity11 settlements , built since the june 1967 war , have increasingly encroached on @entity14 's farmland , and @entity11 , on grounds of security , has built its security barrier around the town			1
as a result , @entity14 residents say they have lost access to much of their land , their water sources , in short their livelihood			0
beginning two years ago , every friday they hold protests against @entity11 's settlement expansion and barrier building			2
most @entity14 residents are not ideological hotheads ; before the outbreak of the second @entity9 intifada , or uprising , in september 2000 , many worked in @entity11			1
most are still fluent in @entity60 and do business with @entity62 looking for a good deal on car repairs and other services			2
for that reason i thought @entity14 would be a good place to see what @entity9 were thinking			0
what i heard was universal pessimism			1
no one i spoke with expressed the slightest hope that any of the leading candidates -- @entity76 's @entity75 , @entity78 's @entity77 , @entity80 's @entity79 and @entity82 's @entity81 -- would do anything to remove the settlements that are slowly closing in on @entity14			0
as we sheltered from the tear gas behind a house , @entity14 resident @entity85 told me , " i do n't expect anything to come out of the elections that will please the @entity9			0
just killings , expulsions and land confiscations			0
" another man , @entity94 , had a slightly different approach			0
he prefers @entity11 leaders to be honest about their intentions , and not raise hopes only to dash them later			0
he wants @entity76 leader and long - time hardliner @entity75 to win			0
" at least he 's honest			0
he says he 'll expel us , and he will expel us			0
he says he 's slaughter us , and he will slaughter us			0
" i 've covered almost every @entity11 election since 1996			2
with each election , the @entity9 feeling of despair and hopelessness only deepens			2
since the last election in the spring of 2006 , @entity9 have seen @entity11 and @entity112 go to war , @entity13 settlements continue to expand , @entity108 and @entity109 fight it out in @entity115 with @entity108 taking control in june 2007			1
they 've also seen a series of @entity11 incursions into @entity115 , culminating recently in the 22 - day @entity11 offensive that left large parts of the strip in ruins			2
meanwhile many @entity9 say their leadership -- often described as moderate and pro-western -- in @entity125 is incapable of reversing the trend of settlement expansion			0
the same leadership has been unable to convince @entity11 to remove few of the hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints that make travelling around the @entity13 a test of patience and endurance			1
in short , when @entity9 look back over the last 15 years since the @entity135 were signed , they 've seen their lot only go from bad to worse			0
as a result , more and more @entity9 are convinced the only way to beat the @entity62 is to join them , to discard failed attempts at creating a @entity9 state in an ever smaller , ever more economically unviable territory , and go for what is known as the one - state solution			1
that would mean @entity9 in the @entity13 and @entity115 relinquishing their dream of an independent @entity9 state , and instead insisting on equal rights in the territory between the @entity148 and the @entity149 , an area that is , for all intents and purposes , under @entity11 's control anyway			1
the one - state solution is an anathema to many @entity62 , who are well aware that , with their higher birth - rate , @entity9 ( those living within @entity11 proper , plus @entity158 , the @entity13 and @entity115 ) could well become a majority within a generation			1
@entity62 increasingly worry the national struggle between @entity11 and the @entity9 will be transformed into an internal struggle , for equal rights for all those living within historic @entity164			1
those fears prompted @entity11 's current caretaker prime minister , @entity166 , to warn as far back as november 2007 that if @entity11 does n't move quickly to achieve a two - state solution , it will be in a position not unlike @entity169 during the apartheid area , whereby a minority -- in this case @entity11 jews -- rules over a restive majority -- the @entity9 -- by means of force , repression and discriminatory laws			1
many @entity9 argue that is already the case , citing @entity11 restrictions on movement , residence , and work			1
the bedrock of @entity11 antipathy toward the @entity9 is part of the reason for the growing strength of the @entity80 ( @entity11 is our home ) party , led by @entity194			1
he argues that @entity11 's @entity9 minority ( they make up about 20 percent of the population ) as a potential fifth column working against the aims of the @entity202 majority			1
@entity194 has focused much of his fire on @entity9 @entity205 members such as @entity206 , accusing him and others of sympathising with @entity11 's enemies , @entity108 and @entity112			1
his solution is to compel all of @entity205 members -- and possibly all @entity11 citizens -- to take an oath of loyalty to the state			2
another of @entity194 's proposals is to redraw @entity11 's boundaries to exclude as many of its @entity9 as possible			1
@entity206 responds that @entity194 's growing clout is symptomatic of " an obvious fascist phenomena invading @entity11 society			2
during the last years , racism became mainstream			0
" back in the town of @entity14 , the kids throwing stones at @entity11 troops do have some odd companions			2
@entity62 , some of them self - described anarchists , also take part in the protests			2
they do n't throw stones , but they do offer useful advice			0
" @entity231 ! @entity231 ! " one @entity11 with black tattoos on his arms tells a young boy , no older than 12 , hurling rocks with a home - made sling			2
" @entity231 " is arabic for " cover your face , " the advice imparted because if @entity11 troops can identify stone throwers , they arrest them			0
there still is cooperation of sorts between @entity9 and @entity62 , but it 's an increasingly rare commodity			1
and this election probably wo n't do anything to bridge the growing gap between the two -- the curious friendship in @entity14 notwithstanding .			0
