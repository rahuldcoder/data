every year , thousands of @entity1 tourists choose the small residential town of @entity3 over the hustle and bustle of larger resort towns			1
even president @entity7 and his family have made it their yearly holiday vacation destination			1
located off the southeast coast of @entity1 , @entity3 boasts beachfront properties overlooking pristine white sand beaches			1
but residents are now asking @entity1 's @entity16 to stop promoting the town as an overnight destination			2
" we have a city ordinance that does not permit these short terms tourist rentals in residential areas , " said @entity19 , @entity20			1
he cited a @entity25 land use ordinance approved in the 1980s			2
" we are not against having tourists in the community			2
it is a nice community for them to come and see			0
it has a nice beach and everything , but it is not proper to have a residential community used for overnight accommodations , " @entity20 said			2
a move to slow tourism in september , the @entity37 approved a motion asking the @entity16 " to respect the zoning and quality of life of our residential neighborhoods , and immediately stop promoting @entity3 as a tourist destination and an alternative to @entity46			1
" @entity46 , on the south of the island , is home to several high - end hotels and a lively night scene			0

the @entity37 has brought up the issue of illegal short term rentals to the city and the county of @entity25 , but due to the lack of staffing , it has been difficult to enforce the ordinance , @entity20 said			1
