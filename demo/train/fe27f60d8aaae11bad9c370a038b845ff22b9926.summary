-- it is a problem of massive plastic proportions -- a giant floating debris field , composed mostly of bits and pieces of plastic , in the northwest @entity7 , about a thousand miles off the coast of @entity9			1
researchers recover nets from the @entity7 on august 3 , 2009			1
it 's called the @entity14 and it covers a vast area of hundreds , maybe even thousands , of miles of open ocean			0
now researchers are trying to learn more about the sea - bound trash zone and perhaps find answers to basic questions			1
a crew of scientists from the @entity25 's @entity24 has embarked on a three - week mission aboard the research vessel @entity27 , heading for the debris field to study it			1
the mission is not as straightforward as it sounds			0
" there may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you 'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon , " said @entity31 , deputy director for research at the @entity24			1
" it 's relatively sparse , and you might or might not see something visible to the human eye at any particular location out there , " @entity31 says			0
" certainly one does encounter pieces of plastic stuff that are big enough to see			1
but the other side of the puzzle is all the little bits and pieces of plastic that you ca n't even see unless you scoop up a sample of seawater and see what 's in there			2
" " i think it 's a little misleading to think of it as a great big island that you could practically get out and walk on , but the point is it 's a big area of ocean			0
so even a few pieces of plastic per square meter amounts to a lot of plastic when you add it up over this enormous ocean area			1
" there has been some previous research on this garbage field , but not much			0
it 's been very poorly studied in a scientific sense			0
major questions remain : how how much stuff is there ? what size is the stuff ? where is it distributed in the ocean , at the surface or at what depth ? what does it do to the food chain , especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain ? while the main focus of the @entity24 mission is the impact of this plastic trash on marine life , researchers will gather information on a wide variety of issues			1
here 's what scientists do know : they know the size of this zone is huge , maybe as big as @entity108			1
and they know that all the plastic accumulated in the patch has mostly broken down into smaller bits , floating just under the water 's surface like confetti , basically a soupy mix of plastic - filled seawater that stretches for maybe thousands of miles			1
they know the garbage patch has been growing for many years , and scientists first became aware of the problem years ago when fisherman reported encountering widespread debris			1
they know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world , but this one is the biggest			1
@entity130 with the @entity131 says this giant garbage patch , in addition to plastic , also contains huge masses of fishing nets , which destroys ecosystems around the @entity138			2
but the plastic is really the toxic killer			2
while it slowly degrades , it turns into increasingly smaller bits of plastic			2
seabirds mistake it for food and they dive down and eat it			0
@entity130 says they find a lot of skeletons of seabirds on the @entity138 and " their gut content is just filled with plastic			2
" @entity130 says that has scientists wondering what other animals are eating this plastic			1
as the larger animals and marine life eat the smaller animals , this plastic eventually ends up in the human food supply , too			2
but even the size is of the @entity14 is uncertain			0
" it 's not a hard and fast number			0
it 's a little bit like a whirlpool on the surface of a river or a lake			0
you 'd be hard - pressed to tell me where the edge is			2
all you know is that it 's stronger in the middle than it is in the outer reaches			0
but it 's an area of many hundreds of miles -- perhaps thousands -- in which the ocean currents tend to bring it together , " according to @entity31			0
@entity131 has tracked the @entity14 movement to some degree			0
scientists know it moves as much as a thousand miles north and south in the @entity7 seasonally			2
and during warmer ocean periods , known as @entity192 , it drifts even further south			0
a kind of large , clock-wise circulation of currents driven by the wind around the @entity7 basin causes the plastic and other garbage to mix together in convergence zones , forming this giant trash zone and making its movements comparable to a whirlpool			1
researchers believe this enormous trash zone accumulated over many years from trash being dumped off boats and ocean - going ships , and from trash accumulated on beaches , where it eventually washed in the @entity7 and into the huge zone			1
this study mission may even help scientists determine whether there 's any way to clean up the @entity14 and , if so , the best way to do it			0
@entity0 's @entity219 contributed to this report .			0

researchers are trying to learn the effects of the plastic and debris on *wildlife*
*experts* from the @entity24 will spend three weeks at sea
scientists say this sea - bound trash zone is largest among worldwide debris fields
researchers believe this enormous trash zone accumulated over many years
