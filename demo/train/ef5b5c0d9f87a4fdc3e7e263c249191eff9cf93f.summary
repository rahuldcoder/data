@entity27 has turned underground water in many places too salty and alkaline for drinking or irrigation , prompting some experts to call for moving half of @entity0 's population elsewhere			0
a lake the size of 40,000 soccer fields has completely dried up , leaving countless clamshells scattered on the sandy lakebed the only evidence of the once - flourishing aquatic life			0
for @entity4 , 27 , these jarring images serve as a daily reminder of an urgent mission : rescuing his hometown from the encroaching sands			1
" many trees were cut down in the 1980 's to make way for large - scale land exploitation , while we were losing water from upstream because of drought , " he said			0
" the environment started to deteriorate rapidly			2
" after high school @entity4 had traveled across southwestern @entity1 as a pharmaceutical salesman			1

" two years later he signed an ambitious agreement with his native village , taking over 27 hectares of arid land for reforestation			0
" this place used to be a forest when my grandfather was young , " he reminisced			0
" you would disappear in the tall trees if you walked in here			0
" on this bright morning , @entity4 followed a pair of donkeys as they pulled two full tanks of water slowly across a harsh landscape dominated by an immense expanse of sand			1
the wheelbarrows stopped at @entity4 's ecological forest site a short trek away , where patches of green are already breaking the monotony of yellow			1
" we have planted these suosuo ( saxauls ) on five hectares of land , " @entity4 pointed at what looked like were mere scrub on the ground			1

armed with buckets and shovels , @entity4 and other volunteers have been painstakingly watering their young trees once a month			1
" so far 90 percent of the saplings have survived , " @entity4 said			1
" every time i see them grow , i feel a sense of great accomplishment			0
" " when the trees grow to 4 to 5 meters tall , they will be able to shield nearby farmland from the sand blown over by wind -- or even improve the climate on site			0
" for now , @entity4 is focusing on receiving official blessing for his planned environmental ngo by the end of the year , which he hopes will make fund raising an easier task			1
planting and caring for trees in the desert has proven too costly to rely solely on small donations			2
