earlier in the second half , @entity5 goalkeeper @entity15 produced two wonder saves to keep @entity3 at bay , both from @entity19			1
first , the @entity20 stretched to palm over a header which looked destined for the top corner and then repeated the trick from another fierce header which he pushed out			0
after @entity2 's 80th minute goal , @entity3 went in desperate search of an equalizer and @entity31 's close range effort was blocked by the excellent @entity32			2

@entity3 coach @entity74 replaced him with @entity76 and he was kept the busier of the two goalkeepers			0
early in the second half , @entity76 could only watch as a @entity79 van der vaart chip went narrowly side , but then @entity3 , sparked by the introduction of @entity81 , at last began to show the form which has taken them top of @entity85 this season			0
