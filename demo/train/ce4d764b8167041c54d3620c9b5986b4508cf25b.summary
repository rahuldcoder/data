@entity0 -- on the outskirts of @entity0 , behind a small government building , underneath a soccer field and skateboard park , sits a remarkable feat of engineering			2
it 's an example of how @entity10 's capital , which lies in a region at high risk from flooding and tropical cyclones , is trying to figure out how to contain the elements to protect its 13 million inhabitants			1
the entrance , which is locked at all times , is so nondescript a visitor may walk past dozens of times without ever noticing it			0
but today , we are given a tour down below of the so - called " @entity25			1
" built between 1993 and 2006 at a cost of nearly $ 3 billion , the stunning complex is far more impressive than its name suggests			0
winding down a series of stairs , you soon come upon a massive hall , resembling an underground @entity33 , or a scene out of a science fiction film			0
in pictures : @entity38 's trail of destruction the initial water tank stretches more than 320 feet in length and towers higher than a five - story building			1
when you add it all up , the complex features five massive shafts , or tanks , that are able to move water along a tunnel that stretches nearly four miles			1
special : @entity0 battles the elements in this area of @entity53 , heavy rains would often flood the @entity54			0
but now , that valuable farmland has an incredible drain system sitting below			0
when the tanks and tunnel fill , engineers are able to turn on the heart of the system , which is a series of four turbines powered by jet engines similar to those used in a @entity66 airplane			1
the turbines are then able to rapidly funnel floodwaters to the nearby @entity69			1
it 's worth noting that this part of suburban @entity0 can hardly be compared to the dense underground of @entity73 , which is a maze of subway tunnels , sewage systems and power lines			2
the engineers here are the first to point out that their system , while remarkable , is meant to deal with heavy rains -- and that it would struggle to cope with a @entity38 - type storm surge coming from the @entity83 into @entity73 's @entity84			2
still , the underground marvel could inspire engineers to look for new ways to try to contain @entity88 in the future			0
huge plugs could have spared subways from flooding , developers say			0

@entity10 's " @entity25 " complex drains floodwater into @entity69
underground complex is higher than five - story building , stretches nearly four miles
system 's heart is four turbines powered by jet engines similar to those in @entity66 plane
