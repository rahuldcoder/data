@entity0 -- an ancient @entity3 symbol of freedom , tolerance and coexistence has joined documents like the @entity8 , the @entity9 and the @entity10 in @entity0			1
the @entity12 represents the spirit and ideals of @entity11 , the leader of the @entity15 in the sixth century @entity16 after peacefully conquering @entity17 in 539 b.c.and declaring his principles on the cylinder , @entity11 freed the @entity21 population of @entity17 from long bondage and rebuilt the @entity23 in @entity24			1
the @entity12 inspired many throughout history -- in particular 18th century @entity28 philosophers , historians and politicians in @entity31 and @entity32 -- as a source of their thinking on human rights , settling conflicts and leadership			1
@entity38 reportedly owned two copies of the @entity40 , @entity42 's biography of @entity11 , and carried it for inspiration and guidance			1
today -- far from ancient @entity47 and the @entity28 , in a different , far more divided @entity48 -- the @entity32 is struggling to open a window to resolve long - lasting tensions with @entity47 , tensions entwined closely with the fate of @entity52 , @entity32 's principal ally in the region			1
" the @entity12 sets up a model to run a multifaith , multifaceted , diverse society , leaving a model of the @entity48 as a unit and what it could ideally be , " said @entity55 , director of the @entity56 , in a recent @entity57			1
the 2,600 - year - old , football - sized clay cylinder is on loan from its permanent display at the @entity56 in @entity67 for a five - city tour that began saturday in @entity0			1
" in the @entity21 tradition @entity11 is known as the divinely anointed figure who enabled the @entity21 to restore their sacred institutions , " said rabbi @entity70 , executive director of the foundation @entity71 , a @entity72			1
" many in exile chose not to return to @entity24 and the @entity79 because they felt comfortable and safe with the lives they had in the @entity3 lands , " shared values and common heritage that draw people together are subject to interpretation and can also push people apart			1
yet , @entity70 argues , " @entity52 's identity is woven with the ancient stories of the @entity89 that happened throughout its borders , and now it 's helpful to emphasize these core narratives that contain examples of cooperation and coexistence as a reminder that a different paradigm is possible			0
" rabbi @entity99 , director of the @entity100 at @entity101 , suggests a country should be defined by the values of its culture and history rather than the policies of its government			0
" disputes should attack issues , not civilizations , " @entity99 said			0
an expert on @entity115 - @entity52 diplomacy , @entity99 said such an approach creates more " nuanced " relations			0
ping pong diplomacy nuances are seen in president @entity121 's cultural exchange program in the 1950s , which sent @entity32 jazz musicians , dancers and other artists to countries with strained diplomatic ties with the @entity32 during the height of the @entity129			2
that paved the way for @entity134 premier @entity133 's visit to the @entity32 in 1959			2
and an invitation from @entity136 to a @entity32 national ping pong team in the early 1970s led to president @entity139 's visit in 1972 -- the first by a @entity32 president since the @entity143 takeover in 1949			2
" exchange derives the history of values globally , and the social empathy that comes from cultural exchange is better than one thousand negotiations , " @entity99 said			0
cultural exchanges are going on between the @entity32 and @entity47 , even with the ongoing conflict over its nuclear ambitions			2
the @entity32 wrestling team was welcomed in @entity154 last month			2
eight @entity47 art experts have planned a visit to the @entity32 as part of a @entity159 cultural exchange program , which coincides with the arrival of the @entity12			1
" when you 're engaging with @entity47 , you should communicate based on those shared values , " @entity99 said			0
" we all love the same values			0
yet , we happen to have disagreements , so what should we do about those disagreements ? which is the point that ultimately leads to arguments and diplomacy			0
" " if @entity47 see a single , even small indication that today , the @entity32 is going to talk and act wisely , i can assure you that talking to the @entity32 or any other nation around the world is welcomed by the @entity47 , " @entity172 , the @entity47 ambassador to the @entity173 , told @entity1 last week			0
with the @entity12 tour coming to the @entity32 during a pivotal time in the relations of @entity32 and @entity47 , the wisdom of @entity11 could guide diplomats to build constructively upon shared values			1
" each time a leader brings out the best things in the people they are fighting , magical things happen , " @entity99 said			0
the @entity12 is on display at the @entity191 's @entity190 and @entity192 through april 28			0
it will be in @entity194 from may 3 through june 14 ; @entity195 from june 20 - august 4 ; @entity196 from august 9 - september 22 ; and @entity197 from october 2 - december 2 .			0
