vilified by the international community for his government 's attitude on gay rights , @entity1 president @entity0 has found himself an ally in @entity8 supremo @entity7			1
@entity0 's government , whose recently - introduced anti-gay legislation -- which prohibits spreading so - called " gay " propaganda to minors -- has been a focal point of critics			1
opponents argue that the law enacted last year is in contravention to the spirit of the @entity19 , with the @entity21 version being hosted this month by the @entity1 @entity23 resort of @entity24			2
but in an exclusive interview with @entity26 , @entity7 says he " completely agrees " with @entity0 's policy towards homosexuals			1
" he has n't said he does n't agree ( with homosexuality ) just that he does n't want these things publicized to an audience under the age of 18 , " said @entity7 , arguing critics had misrepresented @entity0			1
" i completely agree with those sentiments and if you took a world census you 'd find 90 % of the world agree with it as well , " added the 83 - year - old , who oversees one of the world 's most lucrative sports			1
the @entity8 ringmaster last met with @entity0 in february 2013 , when he flew to @entity24 to assess construction progress ahead of @entity1 's debut grand prix			1
the @entity23 resort town will stage round 16 of this year 's world championship on a circuit that will run around the @entity52 's facilities			2
@entity7 believes @entity1 has done a " first - class job " in the new circuit 's preparation and a " super job " hosting the @entity19 and that more credit should be given to @entity0			1
" i 've great admiration for him and his courage to say what he says , " said the octogenarian			1
" it may upset a few people but that 's how the world is			0
it 's how he sees ( the world ) and i think he 's completely right , " @entity7 added			1
the controversial billionaire is due to face trial in @entity72 , which is scheduled to start in april , accused of making corrupt payments to a banker who worked on the sale of @entity8 in 2006			0
@entity7 denies the charges , along with those brought against him in a civil case in @entity79 , where he was accused of undervaluing the sport of @entity8 in the same deal			1
@entity7 was cleared in the latter case thursday , despite being labeled as " not reliable or truthful " by the judge -- who ruled that @entity72 company @entity87 's claim for compensation was without merit			1
justice @entity92 said @entity7 had entered into a " corrupt agreement " with banker @entity94 in 2005 , but the magistrate said no loss to @entity97 had been proved , the @entity91 @entity90 reported			0
succession planning with @entity7 's legal problems casting doubt over his future in @entity8 , the media has been speculating about his possible successors -- with @entity106 team principal @entity104 and @entity107 , chief executive of @entity91 supermarket @entity109 's top of the list			1
@entity7 said it was hard to assess whether they had the right skills needed for the job			0
" i 've no idea what attributes you 'd need , " he told @entity26			2
" it 's like saying we 'd need someone to replace @entity122 , you know ? you never know what they 'd need to have until they start the role			0
" for someone to hold a high position in @entity130 or @entity131 you have to be older than i am -- at least the good thing about that is you 're not going to have them for that long ! " @entity8 revamp this season @entity8 will see wide - scale changes			0
as well as @entity1 making its debut on the race calendar , the cars will be powered by smaller , @entity141 hybrid engines that promise greater fuel efficiency			2
however , the move away from the loud @entity144 is a development that concerns @entity7 , who is worried the sport may lose some of its drama through the subsequent noise reduction			0
" i 'm not at all happy with the sound of the new engines , to be honest , " he said			0
" it does n't sound like @entity8 , but that 's my opinion , let 's wait and see what the public think			2
" the system for awarding points to drivers has also been revamped			0
the victor in the season - ending @entity161 will now win 50 points compared to the 25 points on offer for each of the other 18 races , and @entity7 is keen to extend that change to the last three events			0
" the reason is simple -- with the calendar as it is the championship could be over by september and if there 's another three races to go and a car that looks like it could win easy now -- ( the rival cars ) if they win two or three races at the end , could win the championship ( instead ) , " said @entity7			2
" why should it devalue six races before the end ? people will be following like hell to see who 's there at the end of the races			0
win the last three and you can win the championship , it 's a whole different scenario			0

@entity7 backs @entity1 president @entity0 on gay rights issue
" i 've great admiration for his courage to say what he says , " @entity8 chief tells @entity26
" 90 % of the world agree with him as well , " says @entity7 ahead of @entity1 's @entity8 debut
@entity7 is cleared by @entity79 court thursday in compensation case
