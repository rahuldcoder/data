@entity0 -- they 're known as trademark " squatters " and they 've long caused headaches for foreign companies entering the @entity9 market			1
savvy to @entity9 's complex trademark laws , these individuals target valuable foreign brands and register them as trademarks in @entity9			1
when international companies want to launch their products on the @entity9 market , they 're often left with little choice but to cough up huge sums to buy back the trademark , rebrand their product or fight for the right to use the brand through lengthy legal battles			1
one of @entity25 's most popular wine brands , @entity26 , is currently at the center of a legal dispute over the use of its own name in @entity9			1
@entity31 , the owner of the wine , said this week that someone in @entity9 has claimed ownership of the @entity9 name for @entity26 -- @entity37 -- a transliteration that means " chasing prosperity			2
" the company is engaged in legal action with the individual to " ensure the integrity of the brand is protected , " a spokesperson for @entity31 told @entity1 in an emailed statement			2
notorious squatter that individual , according to the @entity48 , which first broke the story , is a " notorious trademark squatter " named @entity52			0
a @entity54 - @entity9 wine distributor , @entity52 won a similar case against a @entity57 winemaker last year			1
@entity31 is confident it is the lawful owner of the trademark , the company 's spokesperson said , and the @entity25 winemaker did initially win a court case allowing it to use the @entity9 name for its wine in @entity9			1
but @entity52 is now appealing the decision , according to the @entity48			0
" it will take some time for the @entity9 legal system to process this matter , " @entity31 said			1
@entity31 's case and the many others that have made headlines in recent years should be a warning to foreign companies of the risks they can be exposed to if they fail to familiarize themselves with trademark laws in one of the world 's largest consumer markets , legal experts say			1
' @entity81 to file ' wins many foreign businesses have come unstuck because @entity9 's trademark laws follow a " first to file " principle			1
that means whoever has a trademark registration approved first in @entity9 , owns the rights to that trademark			1
this differs from countries like the @entity93 and many @entity95 countries that follow a common law system , where a person registering a trademark also has to show they 've used , or plan to use the mark in business			2
but companies do have opportunities to challenge trademarks already registered in @entity9			1
one option is to prove the individual deliberately claimed ownership of the brand with the intention of blackmailing a foreign brand entering the market			2
another is to show that the brand was already well - known when the trademark was registered			1
in practice , convincing a court on these points has proved difficult for many companies , but legal experts believe recent amendments to @entity9 's trademark laws , among other factors , could improve trademark protection for foreign brands			1
here are some of the most recent , prominent cases			0
@entity125 earlier this month , @entity9 businessman @entity126 reportedly sued @entity93 electric car manufacturer @entity125 for illegally using its own name , and demanded that the company stop all car sales and marketing activities in @entity9			2
@entity126 , who has a history of filing trademarks for names used by foreign brands , is seeking 23.9 million yuan ( us $ 3.84 million ) from @entity125			1
he says he filed for the right to use the @entity137 name @entity138 in 2006 , and planned to manufacture an electric car named after the inventor @entity138			0
he later applied to register related trademarks , including a @entity9 transliteration of the name and the @entity93 auto manufacturer 's logo			1
@entity125 , which launched its @entity146 luxury electric car in @entity9 last year , says its claim to the name has already been upheld by other @entity9 authorities and the lawsuit is without merit			2
a @entity153 court is due to hold an appeal hearing on august 5			0
@entity155 pharmaceutical giant @entity155 fought an 11 - year trademark , patent and @entity159 trademark battle over the @entity161 brand after it failed to register the @entity9 name for the erectile dysfunction drug before it introduced the product on the @entity9 market in 2000			1
it won the patent and @entity159 trademark litigation but lost the trademark case because it could n't provide sufficient evidence to show it had become well - known among @entity9 consumers under the name @entity172 ( meaning " mighty brother " )			1
for similar reasons , luxury retailer @entity174 and whisky brand @entity175 have lost bids to stop clothing manufacturers from selling products under their names			0
singers and sports stars celebrities are n't immune either			0
a man in @entity186 owns the right to use the name of @entity190 pop singer @entity189 , while the names of @entity193 stars like @entity195 's @entity194 and @entity197 's @entity196 are used to promote products ranging from shoes to pesticide , according to @entity201			0
two years ago , @entity93 basketball legend @entity202 filed a lawsuit against a sportswear company called @entity205 ( a transliteration of @entity202 's name )			2
the multi-million dollar company even registered trademarks for the names of his two sons , @entity212 and @entity213 ( @entity214 and @entity215 )			0
and it 's not only foreign stars who have been affected			0
in 2006 , @entity9 @entity219 star @entity218 managed to block the trademarking of his name on a line of women 's sanitary products			2
@entity226 ¨ res in the largest trademark litigation case in @entity9 's wine industry to date , @entity57 winemaker , @entity226 ¨ res had to completely rebrand its wines in @entity9 after losing a four - year legal battle to @entity52 , the defendant in the @entity26 case			1
@entity52 's company reportedly registered " @entity236 " to import @entity54 wines , and later @entity57 wines , into @entity9 about 15 years ago			2
around the same time , @entity238 began bottling wine in @entity9 and became known to @entity9 consumers by the same @entity9 name			0
( in a market where many consumers do n't read latin letters , @entity9 characters hold much more sway when it comes to brand recognition			2
) @entity52 reportedly offered to sell the trademark to @entity250 for 1 million euros ( $ 1.3 million )			0
@entity238 refused the offer and chose to sue @entity52 in 2005 , arguing that his company had not used the @entity254 name in three years			0
@entity52 subsequently sued @entity250 for trademark infringement and was awarded 33.73 million yuan ( us $ 5 million ) by a @entity257 court last year			0
but @entity9 's supreme court overturned the verdict and has ordered a retrial , which is still pending			1
in the meantime , @entity238 has registered a new @entity9 trademark , " @entity263			2
" will things improve ? new amendments to @entity9 's trademark laws that came into effect in may this year could make things easier for foreign companies			1
" the extent of which we 're not sure , " said @entity270 , a partner at law firm @entity271 , because there have n't been any major decisions handed down subsequent to the changes			0
@entity278 , @entity279 legal counsel at @entity280 in @entity153 , said the laws will make things easier , but the number one reason these kind of disputes are likely to decrease is that companies are better informed about navigating the @entity9 market these days			1
" a lot of ( these disputes ) originated years and years ago			0
it 's been a multi-year process of litigation , " @entity278 said			0
" in some cases , when you 're talking about companies from common law countries , they came over here and were really unfamiliar with the legal system			2
they did n't realize it was a file - first system			0
" " a lot of them did n't do their homework and were making crazy mistakes when using their foreign names in the local market			0
" overseas companies better understand what evidence they need to make a good case these days , added @entity314			0
what can foreign companies do ? for many companies it 's probably already too late to assert their rights over their brands , according to @entity278			1
" for a lot of them , unfortunately the answer is invest in time travel technology because if you have a problem the chances are the roots of it are years old			0
" those companies should take steps to find out immediately where they stand right now , he added			0
it 's easy to do a free , informal search of @entity9 's online trademark database			1
if the trademark has already been registered by someone else , companies will have to go through " painful " legal proceedings that could take several years			2
if the company loses , it faces the choice of shelling out a lot of money to buy the trademark or rebranding			0
companies should make sure they have the right advice on the ground , that takes into consideration their long - term business strategy , such as any new markets the brand may enter in the future , said @entity314			1
even for companies that do n't have global or local help there 's a wealth of information that they can access on the internet these days , in ways that most businesses 15 or even 10 years ago could n't , said @entity278			0
while the cost of registering a trademark is miniscule compared to the amount a company could end up paying in legal fees , @entity278 points out that not all companies , especially start - ups , have the financial flexibility to ensure all their brands have comprehensive trademark coverage			1
for those companies , he suggested getting minimal coverage for core brands and expanding from there			0
" you just have to be smart about it , " he said .			0

many register trademarks of well - known foreign brands in @entity9 to sell them for large sums
top @entity25 winemaker at center of legal dispute after failing to register @entity9 name for its brand
@entity9 's trademark laws tend to favor so - called " trademark squatters " over foreign companies
new amendments to laws and greater understanding of @entity9 's system likely to make things easier for companies
