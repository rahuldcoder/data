the rates of @entity2 children affected by attention deficit - hyperactivity disorder are skyrocketing , according to a recent report , but experts caution that the latest numbers require a bit of decoding			1
that information shows that 11 % of children aged 4 to 17 were diagnosed with @entity3 , a 16 % increase since 2007 , the last time that researchers at @entity12 ( @entity12 ) did a comprehensive survey for the prevalence of the neurobehavior disorder			1
the rise was especially dramatic among boys , with an estimated 1 in 5 boys in high school diagnosed with @entity3			2
what 's more , about two - thirds of the children diagnosed were treated with stimulant medications that can improve attention but also come with side effects			1
are rates truly climbing at such an alarming rate ? possibly			2
but many experts believe that 's unlikely			2
the data was collected by the @entity12 and analyzed and reported by the @entity31 ; the @entity12 plans to publish its own report on the data in the coming months			0
@entity34 : are adhd medications being overused ? to start , the information on adhd rates came from parents reporting on the diagnosis for their children during telephone interviews			1
such reports are useful but not as reliable as the verified diagnoses from medical or school records , says dr. @entity45 , director of the developmental medicine center at @entity47			0
second , such records - based data suggests that adhd rates among children may be somewhere between 7.5 % and 9.5 % , with boys at the higher end of the range , not 11 %			2
in its previous round of analysis , @entity12 found that @entity3 diagnoses rose by 22 % between 2003 and 2007 , based on the same telephone surveys of 76,000 families in the @entity2 , climbing by an average of 3 % to 6 % each year between 2000 and 2010			1
but the latest figures , which included responses collected between 2011 and 2012 , show a far higher prevalence that hints at classrooms full of hyperactive and impulsive kids			0
" by definition , @entity3 requires that symptoms have to have a significant effect on life , " says @entity45			2
" to say that a tenth of all children have a biologic condition that affects their life enough to call it a disorder just does not make sense			0
" @entity34 : teens taking adhd drugs to get good grades if that 's the case , then a significant proportion of these children may also be mistreated with medications that they do n't need			1
" this report and others raises questions about whether we may not be overdiagnosing adhd and overusing medications , " says dr. @entity85 , director of the center for management of @entity3 at @entity88			1
that could have serious implications for children 's long term mental and physical health , since @entity3 drugs such as @entity99 and @entity100 have been linked to dramatic weight loss and suppressed growth			1
and some experts have voiced concern that early use of the behavior - modifying drugs could alter the natural arc of children 's social and creative development			1
@entity34 : new adhd guidelines include kids as young as 4 the apparent rise in the prevalence of @entity3 highlights several shortcomings in the way that not only @entity3 , but mental health issues in general , are diagnosed and treated in the @entity2 , says @entity45			1
most children are labeled with the disorder by their pediatrician or family doctor , who are n't always trained in providing the in - depth evaluation that a reliable diagnosis requires			1
" symptoms are not and should not be sufficient , " says @entity124 , ceo of children and adults with @entity3 ( @entity127 )			1
" the symptoms have to occur every day for a long period of time , and , more importantly , these symptoms have to lead to major disruption or impairment in at least two areas of a person 's life , such as at school or in relationships			0
" while the @entity140 ( @entity140 ) recently provided an updated guideline on the criteria for a proper adhd diagnosis , including reports not only from parents but from teachers and other daycare personnel about a child 's hyperactive , impulsive and inattentive behavior , not all physicians have the time to carefully collect and vet the input from these sources			0
@entity34 : teens ' use of adhd drugs up sharply in addition , in order to properly identify a child affected by @entity3 , @entity45 , for example , conducts a medical and psychological assessment that takes several hours and requires the child and the parents to complete questionnaires about how the child responds to different situations , which factors seem to trigger hyperactive behavior or inattentiveness , as well as how disruptive these episodes are to the child 's daily activities			2
unfortunately , most insurers do not reimburse for such evaluations , and that pushes already busy doctors to take the path of least resistance -- prescribing medications such as @entity99 or @entity100			0
" that 's the big elephant in the room -- pediatricians and the family practitioner are being asked to sort out a complex situation in an inadequate amount of time without access to data from psychological assessments they need to make these fine distinctions , " says @entity45			0
" so it 's a set - up for inappropriate decisions to be made			0
" and those include not just mis - diagnosis and over-medication of children but mistreatment and even under - diagnosis in some situations			1
in rural and urban areas , where mental health services are scarcer and more stigmatized , rates of adhd diagnoses are slightly lower than in affluent areas , and children in these areas are less likely to be treated properly			1
that could have implications for the long - term health of these children , since studies also show that about 60 % of children with @entity3 have a learning disability , and that 60 % will go on to develop another mental illness by age 19			1
so a proper diagnosis of @entity3 does n't just provide opportunities to treat behavior problems , but potentially mental illnesses as well			1
that 's why " it 's clearly inappropriate to do these superficial assessments , " says @entity45			0
@entity34 : nearly 1 in 4 who seek treatment do n't have adhd being too quick to diagnose the disorder also means doctors may be bypassing effective , non-drug treatments that may benefit many children , especially the youngest			2
the @entity140 recommends that children younger than 6 start with behavior therapy before beginning medications , but writing a prescription is far easier than monitoring a series of sessions that involve training and a commitment of time and effort from parents and family members			2
" the problem we face is that behavioral , psychosocial and non-pharmacologic interventions are not sufficiently available to people , " says @entity85			0
" when i talk to pediatricians and primary care physicians , they tell me they do n't want to be diagnosing adhd as often as they are , and they do n't want to be using medications as often as they are , but they do n't have many other options available			2
it 's difficult to get kids into mental health treatments and psychosocial treatments that they believe many of these children and their families need			0
" these programs are designed to assess what factors trigger and sustain inappropriately impulsive and hyperactive behavior , he says , by involving parents and helping them to modify environmental factors or interactions with their children to modify their behavior			0
playing and engaging more directly with children on a regular basis , for example , tends to calm them down , and setting limits and educating children about the consequences of their actions can also help			0
in groups that @entity280 has conducted with his patients , parents have reported that such behavioral interventions are effective in improving children 's relationships with their parents as well as with their teachers and classmates in school			0
but these programs do n't work in a vacuum , and ideally , parents , doctors and teachers should coordinate their efforts to ensure that the appropriate behavior is being positively reinforced among children with @entity3			1
" the best treatment is a combination of parent training , behavioral intervention , school interventions , and medication where needed , " says @entity124			0
all too often , current therapies are n't taking advantage of the full power of this recipe			0

understanding the rise in adhd diagnoses : 11 % of @entity2 children are affected			1

a recent report shows the rate of @entity2 children with @entity3 is rising
some experts say it raises questions about whether we are overdiagnosing @entity3
and some children may be treated with medications they do n't need , experts say
under - diagnosis may also be a problem in some areas
