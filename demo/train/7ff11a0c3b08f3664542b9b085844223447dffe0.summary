-- a year ago , president @entity1 delivered a speech at the @entity3 in @entity4 in which he made the case that it was time to wind down the " boundless global war on terror " and " perpetual wartime footing " that has been a feature of @entity11 life since 9/11			1
indeed , the @entity13 drone program in @entity14 has stopped completely since the beginning of this year			1
this is a noteworthy development given the fact that there have been 370 drone strikes in @entity14 over the past decade that have killed somewhere between 2,080 to 3,428 people ; most of whom were suspected militants , but also a smaller number of civilians			2
in his speech the president made the case that @entity30 , which carried out the 9/11 attacks , " is on the path to defeat			2
their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us			0
" @entity1 outlined the remaining terrorism threat as coming from " less capable @entity30 affiliates " who are certainly threats to @entity11 diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad , as well from " homegrown extremists , " like those who bombed the @entity43 a little over a year ago			1
such homegrown extremists remain capable of carrying out attacks on the scale of the @entity48 bombings , but such incidents are tragedies rather than national catastrophes , as 9/11 was			0
in the president 's view these kinds of threats do not necessitate that the country remain on an endless war footing			2
and , indeed , it is long past time for the @entity11 to transition away from a state of perpetual war now that the threat from @entity30 to @entity11 national security has diminished significantly both because of @entity30 's own weaknesses and the many defensive measures the @entity11 has taken since 9/11			0
to transition away from a war footing , @entity1 said he would make changes in three key areas : first by reforming the secret @entity13 drone program			1
the president promised that going forward , " there must be near - certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured " for strikes to be authorized			0
second , he said he would move to repeal the @entity72 for the @entity73 ( @entity74 ) that was passed by @entity75 just days after the 9/11 attacks			0
the @entity74 authorized not only @entity11 's longest war in @entity78 , but also @entity11 operations against @entity30 and its allies in @entity14 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
third , @entity1 said he would hasten the closing of the prison camp at @entity85			1
so what has changed in the twelve months since @entity1 gave that speech ? the cessation of drone strikes in @entity14 since the beginning of the year is due to a combination of the president pushing for a more calibrated use of drone strikes ; running out of " high value " @entity30 and @entity96 targets in @entity14 's tribal areas ; very strong pushback from the @entity14 public and government who are opposed to the drone strikes on the grounds that they violate @entity14 's national sovereignty ; and the fact that the @entity14 government is stepping up its own military operations against militants in the @entity14 tribal region of @entity111 , where the majority of @entity13 drone strikes have taken place			1
air strikes by the @entity14 air force , for instance , killed approximately 60 people on wednesday in @entity111			0
in @entity14 , there have also been no reported civilian casualties from @entity13 drone strikes during the past year , according to data collected by the @entity122			1
in contrast , in @entity81 , civilian casualties from @entity11 drone strikes have remained steady over the past year			1
from may 2013 to may 2014 , 16 civilians were killed in @entity11 drone strikes , including a number of civilians in a mid-december strike that mistakenly targeted a wedding party because intelligence reports identified the vehicles as carrying @entity30 operatives			0
there were also 16 civilians killed in drone strikes the previous year in @entity81			1
@entity136 : drones will fill the sky on drones , it is clear that the president 's directives to tighten up on the protocols for authorizing drone strikes have made some real differences in @entity14 both in terms of the falling numbers of civilian casualties and the cessation of drone strikes there			1
but in @entity81 , while the number of civilian casualties has remained constant , the number of drone strikes is actually declining			2
since the president 's speech , there have been 29 drone strikes in @entity81			1
there were 36 strikes in the 12 months before			0
last may , @entity1 also said he looked forward " to engaging @entity75 and the @entity11 people in efforts to refine , and ultimately repeal , the @entity74 's mandate			2
" since it was this authorization for the @entity164 that made possible the introduction of combat troops into @entity78 13 years ago , the natural moment to ultimately repeal the declaration is as the last of @entity11 combat troops leave @entity78 at the end of this year			2
for the moment , the administration has n't taken up this effort , which could meet a good deal of opposition from some in the @entity176 who would likely want to extend and even expand the authorization so that it could permit the use of @entity11 military force against @entity30 - aligned groups around the world			0
opinion : when will drones stop killing innocent people in @entity81 ? and repealing the authorization would also raise some knotty national security and political issues given the present political paralysis and rancor in @entity75			2
first , @entity11 special operations raids against @entity30 members and allies in @entity193 and @entity82 in 2013 were conducted under the @entity74			0
how does one get congressional buy - in for a more narrow legal framework that might constrain such raids ? second , since the drone program draws its legal validity partly from the @entity74 , how would that declaration 's expiration affect the use of drones in countries such as @entity14 ? third , what should the @entity11 do about the 40 or so prisoners at @entity85 who are deemed " too dangerous to release , " but are not chargeable with a crime , and who would theoretically have to be released if the present authorization for the use of force expired ? without that authorization it would not be possible to treat @entity85 detainees as prisoners of war since the war would be effectively over			1
president @entity1 also promised to wind down the prison camp at @entity85 ( @entity216 )			1
since that speech , there have been a number of prisoners released from @entity85 , including two @entity222 prisoners who were transferred to @entity222 in august , and three @entity224 prisoners captured in @entity78 who were transferred to @entity225 in december			2
a recent agreement with @entity228 president @entity227 would allow a further six of the remaining 154 prisoners in @entity231 to be transferred to @entity228			0
at the same time , the @entity1 administration has in the past year successfully put a number of high profile militants on trial in the @entity236 , such as @entity238 's son in law , @entity240 , and @entity241 , a @entity242 - based cleric who helped to direct the 1998 kidnapping of @entity245 tourists in @entity81 by @entity30 - aligned militants			1
despite much hand wringing by politicians about trying prominent terrorists in the @entity11 , those trials , which have taken place a few blocks from the newly rebuilt @entity253 , have proceeded without incident and juries have speedily convicted the terrorists on all counts			0
given the speed and efficacy of these trials , perhaps it 's time for the @entity1 administration to abandon the military tribunal process at @entity85 altogether and bring 9/11 operational planner @entity263 ( @entity263 ) to trial in @entity265			1
such a plan was scuppered three years ago , in part , because of opposition from politicians in @entity270 who claimed it was a public safety risk to hold @entity263 's trial in @entity265			0
these concerns seemed overwrought even at the time and are effectively moot at this point			0
@entity263 has spent the past eleven years in @entity11 captivity but still he has not been put on trial because he is tangled in the cumbersome and largely untested military tribunal process in @entity85			0
to summarize : since the president 's speech arguing for ending @entity11 's endless war on terror , there has been a marked change in the @entity13 's drone program in @entity14 , which has effectively ended			1
yet there has been little real change in the similar drone program in @entity81			2
meanwhile , there has been incremental progress on emptying the prison camp at @entity85 and real progress on using the ordinary civilian court system to convict prominent terrorists			0
as yet there is no serious discussion in @entity75 or by the @entity297 about what , if anything , might happen to the @entity72 for the @entity73 ( @entity74 )			0
given the political realities in @entity4 , our guess is the @entity74 will simply remain in place indefinitely because any effort to replace it or end it will encounter resistance in @entity75 .			0

a year ago , president @entity1 gave a key speech on the " boundless *...* war on terror "
he signaled new *restrictions* on drones and an effort to wind down @entity85 detention
@entity316 : @entity1 's changes have led to *virtual* *suspension* of drones in @entity14
he says drone war goes on in @entity81 , small progress has been made on @entity85
