-- no @entity1 allowed : who are @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 ? if you 're stumped by the question , do n't feel bad			1
most people almost certainly would n't know the answer			1
although it would be nice if we did			2
those six men are people of great accomplishment , rigorous education and training , and astonishing courage			1
right this moment , they are taking part in something so thrilling that it 's hard to believe the world has become so indifferent to it			1
they are the six inhabitants of the @entity27			1
living together hundreds of miles above the surface of the @entity30 , they circle the globe every 90 minutes			1
they travel at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour every second of every day			0
but except when there is a potential crisis on the @entity38 , such as the problem with the cooling system over the holidays , most people are barely aware that they are up there			1
their mission is like something @entity45 would have dreamed up in an old @entity47 novel : five different space agencies from nations across the @entity30 , cooperating to populate and support a self - contained outpost -- a colony the size of a football field -- that circles endlessly above us at unimaginable velocity			1
an international team of intrepid explorers living in space , conducting experiments and research and gazing through the blackness toward the rest of us			1
the @entity27 has been continuously occupied by different teams of astronauts and cosmonauts for more than 13 years			1
@entity68 once knew by heart the names of the original astronauts			1
@entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and their colleagues were as celebrated as any baseball heroes had been in generations that preceded theirs			0
life on @entity30 came to a complete , pulse - pounding standstill when @entity80 and @entity81 first stepped onto the surface of the moon			1
the fascination somehow faded during the space shuttle years			0
unless there was a tragedy , as happened with @entity88 and @entity89 -- and with the exception of the shuttle mission on which @entity73 , at age 77 , became a crew member -- most of the shuttle flights drew little more than a national glance or two			0
it may have had to do with the fact that in an age when television images were king , the shuttles , for all the dangers they presented to their dedicated crews , on tv appeared more like giant commercial airliners than exotic spacecraft as they returned to make their landings			0
the very name -- " shuttle " -- sounded deceptively routine , although the missions were anything but			2
whatever the reason , it seemed more difficult , during the space shuttle era , to get the public especially interested			0
the @entity27 , for all its jaw - dropping technological capabilities , and for all the bravery of its resident astronauts , has faced an even bigger hurdle in attracting the attention of the constantly distracted people of @entity30			1
because the space station has been up there so long , people seldom pause to consider the wonder of it all			2
in recent days , though , it has been in the news			0
@entity132 announced this month that the space station will continue circling the @entity30 for at least four years beyond its previously planned splashdown in 2020			0
now , it will be inhabited until at least 2024			0
and last week the six occupants of the space station finally received their @entity140 gifts			0
the presents from their families , along with crates of supplies , were supposed to be delivered last month , but were delayed			0
the cooling system breakdown had held things up , and then there was an explosion on the sun that unleashed particles that could have caused problems during the transport			0
( and you think you had a creative excuse for being late to work			2
) the gifts and supplies that eventually made it to the station , by the way , were delivered not by @entity132 but by a for - hire private company			2
two such companies , @entity162 and @entity163 , are contracted to fly supplies to the @entity27			1
even that fact plays into the misguided perception down on @entity30 that the space station is , if not ho - hum , then not the stuff of tingling drama			1
there are already plans for privately owned " space taxis " to take future astronauts to and from the station , a far cry from the breathless years of @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178			2
when the unmanned courier craft arrived last week , the space station residents belatedly opened their @entity140 presents			0
( incidentally , included in that cargo delivery was a container of live ants			0
eight hundred or so of them			0
it has something to do with an experiment about weightlessness			0
just what you would most like to unwrap when you 're in a confined area in space , right ? ants			0
) one measure of the public 's attentiveness toward the astronauts of today can be seen in the audience for the @entity201 feed of @entity7 , one of the two @entity68 up there			1
he does , indeed , tweet -- circling the @entity30 , he sends down messages and descriptions so citizens of the world ( those with a computer , smartphone or tablet ) , can in real time and for free be kept up on what is transpiring aboard that miraculous mission			2
it is a way of instant and intimate communication from space that would n't even have been dreamed of not so long ago			2
he has 36,300 @entity201 followers			0
for comparison 's sake , @entity220 has 48.7 million followers for the @entity201 account of his daily doings			2
we can get used to just about anything , or so it seems , but it 's instructive that we have gotten so used to even this : humans from different countries living in harmony as they hurtle perilously through the dark void so far from @entity30			1
@entity236 is no longer around to tell a breathlessly waiting world of such exploits in space			0
but if astronaut @entity7 wants more people to know about the astounding things he is seeing and experiencing up there , perhaps he can prevail upon @entity220 to retweet him			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			1

@entity245 : most people do n't know names of those at the @entity27
he says *spaceflight* used to be awe - *inspiring* . now we see it as routine . that 's *regrettable*
he says six astronauts are from countries around the globe , work together on research
