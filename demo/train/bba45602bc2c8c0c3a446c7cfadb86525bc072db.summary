@entity0 , @entity1 -- the newspapers and television news blaze with shocking images of crowds energized by fury , of buildings set aflame , of diplomatic missions under assault			1
it sounds very much like the @entity12 , but it 's happening in @entity13 , and the target of the mob violence in scores of @entity13 cities is @entity1 and the @entity1			1
in both cases -- in the @entity12 and @entity19 -- the anger reflects a genuine , deeply felt indignation , but the protests have another powerful dimension			1
political groups have turned religious or nationalist sensitivity into a weapon to further their objectives			0
politicians are riding the tiger of popular wrath , hoping to guide it , to control it , to make it attack and wound their enemies , so they can gain an advantage and further their agenda			2
it 's a perilous exercise			2
the tiger can not be easily controlled			0
just as the @entity42 world seemed to explode with violent rage against @entity44 over a blasphemous film , tens of thousands of @entity13 protesters also boiled with barely contained ferocity against an affront by a foreign power			1
it started after the @entity1 government purchased from a private owner a set of uninhabited islands claimed by both countries			1
the obscure dispute over the cluster of rocky islets known as @entity58 in @entity1 and @entity58 in @entity13 has simmered for many decades			1
now , it has turned into one of the most serious confrontations since the two countries established relations in 1972 , pitting the two biggest economies in @entity19 -- no. 2 and no. 3 in the world -- with crowds of @entity13 demonstrators calling for @entity13 to " declare war " against @entity1 -- and worse			1
as protests spread to a hundred @entity13 cities , one sign chillingly suggested , " we must exterminate the @entity1			1
" protesters threw bottles , rocks and eggs at the @entity1 embassy , they smashed and burned @entity1 businesses and vehicles and cars , and they generally overflowed with barely concealed hatred , the flames stoked even higher on the anniversary of the 1931 " @entity83 " that started @entity1 's invasion of @entity13 , the most sensitive spot in historical memory			1
the nationalist pride is real , but there is much more to the mayhem			0
some of the same questions that have emerged from the @entity92 violence in the @entity12 are emerging in @entity13			1
is this all truly spontaneous ? is the timing purely coincidental ? and , above all , who benefits ? in the @entity12 , the repellent little film that triggered @entity42 anger was posted on @entity98 on july 1			1
although it apparently was n't translated into @entity102 until and aired on @entity104 tv around september 5 , the surge of murderous attacks against @entity44 diplomatic missions came , of all days , on september 11			0
in @entity13 , the conflict is happening just as the ruling @entity106 prepares for the @entity107 , when a pivotal power handover is expected			1
the exact date remains unclear , but the country is swimming in speculation about mysterious power struggles as the gathering , possibly next month , approaches			2
in all the mayhem , one can spot the efforts by powerful forces to rile what used to be called " the street			2
" in the @entity42 world , @entity121 parties have a firm tradition of anti-western ideology			0
an @entity44 - made film insulting the prophet muhammad can boost their support			0
the film is despicable , but with today 's technology there will be someone , somewhere , saying or drawing or filming something offensive			2
political and religious leaders have a choice of when to mobilize their followers			0
@entity104 president @entity136 , who came from the @entity137 , saw the tiger coming , and he tried to ride it			0
last week , as protesters unleashed their ire in front of the @entity143 in @entity144 , and news that extremists in @entity147 had killed four @entity44 , including @entity44 ambassador @entity148 , @entity136 's reaction was not to condemn the killings or the violations of a fundamental tenet of diplomacy and international law			1
instead , he demanded the @entity44 take legal action against the filmmaker			0
his @entity137 sought to wave the banner in defense of @entity42 , initially calling for more protests			2
it took several days before @entity136 , on a @entity162 tour , called the attacks on all embassies " unacceptable			0
" if @entity104 wants foreign investment , its government ca n't support attacks against foreign embassies			0
the entire @entity171 world is engaged in a crucial power struggle			2
the people are waging a historic battle to determine what role @entity42 will have in government , in daily life and in the law			0
anti-western protests , under the banner of defending @entity42 , amount to raucous political rallies in support of the more radical , anti-liberal positions			2
those in power face a delicate situation			2
they want to wrap themselves in the flag of @entity42 , prevent their rivals on the right from gaining the upper hand but must avoid appearing irresponsible in the eyes of the international community , the support of which they need to stabilize their economies			0
seeking to benefit from the intensity of emotions , @entity121 militants such as @entity203 's @entity202 called for more protests			1
the @entity13 government also tried to calibrate resentments			2
critics noted that in @entity13 's one - party system , you do n't get a week of violent protests without government approval			1
authorities stoked the flames with praise for the public 's " expression of patriotism , " which the official media called " reasonable " and a " natural reaction " to @entity1 's provocation			1
then , perhaps nervous that demonstrations might turn against the regime , they tried to throttle back the violence			0
@entity13 dissidents examining pictures of the protests said they noticed government officials working the crowd			1
massive , seemingly spontaneous protests can strengthen a government 's hand against outsiders and has a rally - round - the flag effect that can strengthen a regime			2
but some speculated that hard - liners in the @entity106 were trying to bolster their position , perhaps trying to postpone the @entity242 and buy more time to organize			0
when the protests threatened to get out of hand and take a perilous economic toll , the government tried to pull back the reins			0
@entity1 corporations , such as @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 and others shuttered operations in @entity13 , as the @entity1 public , aghast , watched the scenes from just across the sea			1
@entity1 and @entity13 have more than $ 340 billion in trade			1
no government benefits , if the two economies are weakened			0
this latest fashion , blending domestic politics and diplomacy - by - mob , is a dangerous development			0
politicians who try to ride the tiger of populist rage , whether in @entity19 or the @entity12 , will discover they ca n't always rein back the crowd 's passions			1
they may want it to charge against their enemies			0
in the end , however , everyone could get mauled			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			0

furious protests denouncing another nation are happening in @entity13 as well as the @entity12
@entity13 protesters are taking to the streets , *enraged* by @entity1 's purchase of disputed islands
@entity285 : in @entity12 and @entity13 , the powerful are manipulating protests
@entity285 : it 's a risky business to use populist rage to gain power ; the rage is not controllable
