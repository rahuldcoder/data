@entity0 -- the announcement that @entity3 and four other men accused of the 9/11 attacks will soon be moved to @entity0 to face trial in a federal court will be welcomed by some @entity8 as finally starting the process of bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice			1
to date , not one person has been convicted for the attacks			0
but it also will be a reminder that their boss , the man most responsible for killing 3,000 civilians -- the majority of them @entity8 but many from @entity20 -- is still at large			2
president @entity22 has stated that it is vitally important for the country to put some of the controversial policies of the last eight years behind it			1
while the forthcoming trial of @entity3 and several figures allegedly involved in plotting the 9/11 attacks in @entity0 will be helpful , nothing would help more than if @entity31 were captured , afforded full due process and put on trial			1
it would be nothing short of a watershed moment , doing much to restore the public 's confidence in @entity8 institutions and the rule of law after years of being told that they were too quaint for the challenges of a new era			1
and it would go a long way , too , in restoring the moral high ground for the @entity8 in the court of global opinion			2
an indictment dating back to 1998 awaits @entity51 's leader in the @entity52 of @entity0 , which can be easily updated by a grand jury to include his crimes since			2
this is where @entity3 and four others accused of the 9/11 attacks are also expected to be tried			0
less than a mile from ground zero , there could be no more appropriate place to try @entity31			2
there is virtually no chance that @entity31 would walk free from a @entity8 courtroom as there are at least three separate video recordings of him acknowledging responsibility for the 9/11 attacks			1
what 's more , the @entity8 government , thanks to cooperation agreements struck at the end of previous trials , already has at least three former @entity51 insiders lined up , including the @entity76 operative @entity75 , to provide testimony about @entity31 's hands - on involvement in the @entity80			1
a trial for @entity31 in federal court would be somewhat less problematic for prosecutors than for some of the high value detainees now being held in @entity86			1
no " enhanced interrogation techniques " have been employed on @entity51 's leader			0
capturing @entity31 will , of course , not be easy			1
there has been no meaningful intelligence on his location since he escaped from @entity93 in december 2001			0
and @entity31 , believed now to be somewhere in the mountains between @entity95 and @entity96 , will likely do everything he can to avoid being taken into custody			2
" according to our security arrangements , if enemy forces surrounded @entity100 and there was a possibility that he would escape , i was to kill him before they could catch him alive			0
... i constantly stood behind his back around the clock , " @entity105 , @entity31 's chief bodyguard until 2000 , later revealed			2
despite this , the @entity22 administration would be well advised to put its emphasis on capturing @entity31 alive , such would be the benefits of a public trial			1
the @entity22 administration will feel obliged to target @entity51 's leader with a @entity115 strike if there is a narrow window of opportunity -- no other individual inspires and unifies @entity51 like he does , and few have been as slippery -- but if intelligence suggests @entity31 has been living for some time in a particular location , real consideration should be given to sending in a @entity125 team to take him alive			1
the @entity127 administration , while often repeating the mantra of needing to " capture or kill " @entity51 's leader , in practice leaned heavily toward the latter			0
the leader of the @entity134 team charged with tracking down @entity31 at @entity93 later recalled , " we knew the writing on the wall was really to kill him			0
no one wanted to bring @entity31 back to stand trial in the @entity8 somewhere			1
" those in favor of quietly killing @entity51 's leader have argued that a public trial would be dangerous because it would provide @entity31 with a global platform for his views and unleash a wave of terrorist attacks and kidnappings by his comrades in efforts to release him			1
these are concerns that can not be dismissed lightly			0
in a federal trial , @entity31 would have the right to defend himself and the media frenzy over proceedings would likely dwarf even that of the @entity159 trial			1
in the past there has been a link to the imprisonment of individuals beloved of @entity51 and terrorist violence			0
as @entity1 analyst @entity166 documented in " the @entity165 , " the 1993 arrest , trial and imprisonment in the @entity8 of @entity170 ( aka the @entity170 ) , was a central motivating factor for @entity51 's terrorist campaign thereafter			2
in deciding to try @entity3 in @entity0 , the @entity22 administration has clearly decided that the benefits of public trials for high profile terrorism suspects outweigh such dangers			1
@entity177 , a defense lawyer who has represented clients in several of the most high profile terrorism trials in the @entity8 , says , " so what if @entity31 were to articulate his views in court ? " says @entity177 , " he already has a global audience every time he puts out his recordings , but this time the platform would in reality belong to the @entity8			1
" those familiar with those recordings ( which have rarely been aired in full by mainstream media outlets ) can attest to the fact that @entity31 's rambling speaking style , his shallow knowledge of @entity193 and his often twisted logic are unlikely to make his courtroom pronouncements resonate with those who are not already fervent admirers			0
that will particularly be the case if his public defense follows a full documenting by the prosecution of the human suffering he has orchestrated over the years , evidence which should prove devastating to those who still deny @entity31 's culpability			2
" the vast majority of people in the @entity193 world have rejected @entity31 's calls for attacks on civilians , " says @entity213 , a leading @entity214 television presenter , " and nothing @entity31 could say during a trial could change that			2
" would @entity31 's capture lead to a spike of attacks against @entity8 interests ? this is possible to some degree but @entity51 can hardly be accused of having shown any restraint whatsoever in targeting @entity8 since it declared global jihad in 1998			1
conversely , convicting @entity31 could -- in the medium term -- lead to a steep drop in @entity51 violence			0
while martyrdom would seal @entity31 's status in the jihadist movement , capture would seriously deflate it			0
@entity105 , @entity31 's bodyguard put it this way : " in the case of his death , i think he will be a symbol for all those who follow him ...			2
his death will be a great force for stirring up everybody 's emotions and enthusiasm to follow him on the path to martyrdom			0
in the case of his arrest , the situation might be a bit different			0
it might lead to a strong psychological defeat for the group 's members			0
" a trial for @entity31 , undertaken with due process , would not only help the @entity8 take back the moral high ground in the court of global opinion , it would also serve as a powerful counterpoint to the indiscriminate barbarism of @entity31 's terrorist campaign			1
the affording of due process , even of the worst of enemies is line with the best instincts of the @entity8 people			0
a month after 9/11 , when emotions were at their most raw , an @entity272 poll showed that nearly as many @entity8 said they wanted @entity31 tried ( 42 percent ) as said they wanted him instead killed ( 49 percent )			1
there has been no comparable poll since , but given @entity8 voted overwhelmingly for a president who vowed to shut down @entity86 , it would not be farfetched to suggest that the number favoring a trial for @entity31 has substantially increased			1
at the @entity281 in may , president @entity22 made a keynote speech on national security and detention			0
" wherever feasible , we will try those who have violated @entity8 criminal laws in federal courts --- courts provided for by the @entity290			0
some have derided our federal courts as incapable of handling the trial of terrorists			0
our courts and juries , our citizens , are tough enough to convict terrorists , " he said			0
a trial for @entity31 , if he can be captured , is not just feasible , but at this juncture in @entity8 history would be invaluable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity305 .			0

alleged 9/11 *conspirators* are to be put on trial in @entity0
@entity305 says @entity22 should put emphasis on capturing @entity31 for trial
he says a trial would allow @entity8 to show evidence of harm done by @entity31
@entity317 : trial of @entity31 would show strength of @entity8 institutions
