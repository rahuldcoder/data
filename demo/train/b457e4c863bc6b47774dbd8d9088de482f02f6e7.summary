@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity0 district attorney said he plans to look into deaths at a @entity0 hospital in the days following @entity6 , but stopped short of calling it an investigation			1
staff at @entity10 were accused of hastening four patients ' deaths in the wake of @entity6			2
" my office has not reopened an investigation into the deaths at @entity5 " after @entity6 struck the @entity19 in 2005 , @entity14 said in a statement released friday			1
" as district attorney , i have a legal obligation to evaluate statements regarding possible criminal activity in this jurisdiction , " the statement said			1
" i am making that kind of evaluation , but that does not constitute an investigation by this office			2
" the @entity30 reported in a story saturday that @entity14 will interview @entity0 coroner @entity32 and possibly other pathologists on the coroner 's staff regarding the deaths of @entity38 patients			0
but the newspaper quoted @entity14 as saying an investigation would involve convening a grand jury and bringing in witnesses to testify , and he does not at this time have plans to do that			1
after speaking with the coroner , the district attorney said he would decide whether a more in - depth investigation is necessary			1
@entity14 's spokesman , @entity48 , said monday the @entity50 's office had no further comment beyond the friday statement			0
according to the @entity30 , @entity14 's conversation with @entity32 was prompted by an article in the @entity55 last month that quoted two doctors as saying that they gave @entity10 patients morphine and other drugs in the days after the hurricane struck , knowing they would die			0
@entity14 told the newspaper he would be " remiss in his responsibilities " if he did not talk to @entity32 about information in the article			0
" that does n't mean i am opening an investigation , " he said			0
@entity6 roared ashore near the @entity68 - @entity1 state line on august 29 , 2005 , rupturing three of @entity0 ' protective levees and putting about three - quarters of the city under water			2
then - @entity1 attorney general @entity73 launched an investigation after officials from @entity76 , an acute - care facility operating on the seventh floor of @entity10 , reported allegations that several seriously ill , mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at @entity10 as the floodwater rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated			1
in 2006 , @entity73 ordered the arrest of dr. @entity86 and two nurses , @entity88 and @entity89 , on preliminary charges of second - degree murder in the deaths of four patients			0
former @entity0 district attorney @entity94 , who under @entity1 law was responsible for prosecuting crimes , gave @entity97 and @entity99 immunity in exchange for their testimony			1
in july 2007 , the grand jury refused to indict @entity86			1
@entity73 said his investigation revealed that the four patients -- ages 63 , 68 , 91 and 93 -- were given a " lethal cocktail " of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride , both central nervous system depressants			0
@entity86 , @entity99 and @entity88 all denied the charges , and their attorneys said they acted heroically , staying to treat patients rather than evacuate			0
in an interview with @entity115 in 2007 , @entity86 admitted giving the patients drugs			0
" if in doing so it hastened their deaths , then that 's what happened , " she said			0
" but this was not , ' i 'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people			0
' we 're here to help patients			0
" the grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised @entity73 that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after @entity6 struck			1
all five were brought in by @entity73 's office to analyze the deaths , and concluded the patients were homicide victims			0
after the grand jury refused to indict @entity86 , @entity94 called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it			1
if @entity14 does decide an in - depth investigation is warranted , it could affect the outcome of a lawsuit in which @entity2 and @entity30 are seeking the release of @entity148 's investigative file into the deaths			2
@entity2 was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia , six weeks after the hurricane			1
the case went to the @entity154 , which in july sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case is reasonably anticipated , according to @entity159 , the @entity0 attorney representing the media organizations			2
a reopened investigation could lead the court to rule that criminal charges may be forthcoming			2
hospital workers identified only as @entity165 and @entity166 had sued to block the public release of the file , claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules , that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy .			1

*post-katrina* euthanasia was alleged at @entity5
