-- broom or vacuum ? dust mop or @entity4 ? we 've been trying to figure out the best way to get rid of dust since we first started playing house			0
and now there 's real reason to get serious about the stuff			0
a new study from the @entity13 and the @entity14 suggests that the residues of flame - retardant chemicals in essentials like mattresses and tvs are showing up in household dust			1
scientists found these chemicals -- known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( @entity23 ) -- in the dust of all 16 homes they sampled			1
no one knows whether @entity23 can hurt you			0
but their structure is strikingly similar to that of @entity30 , which are suspected of causing cancer and can definitely alter human development			1
some pbdes are banned in most parts of @entity35			0
the good news ? some simple changes can really make a difference in your indoor - air quality			1
vacuum and dust regularly ( once or twice a week should be plenty ) , and use a vacuum with a high - efficiency particulate air , or @entity45 , filter			1
also , try to avoid sweeping , which only circulates dust			0
put used vacuum filters in a bag and close it tightly before discarding			1
try to avoid touching the filters with your hands			2
open your windows as soon as the weather allows it ( including those times when you 're vacuuming )			1
a recent study from the @entity61 government found that @entity23 flame retardants were present in indoor air at concentrations 50 times higher than those found outdoors			2
fresh air and ventilation can help dilute indoor concentrations			2
do n't bother using ' ionizing ' or ' ion - generating ' stand - alone air purifiers			1
recent research shows they 're unlikely to reduce particle concentrations and may generate ozone , a respiratory irritant			0
go easy on air conditioning ; when you turn it on and close your windows , it keeps fresh air from getting in			1
use an air - conditioning filter with the highest minimum efficiency reporting value ( @entity84 ) rating suitable for your system			1
the higher the @entity84 , the more efficient the filter is at removing particles			0
and change the filter regularly , depending on the manufacturer 's specs			0
consider buying home furnishings from @entity93 ( 800 - 434 - 4532 ) , which phased out @entity23 in 2002			2
if you 're looking for a computer or a cell phone , check out @entity98 and @entity99 products ; neither uses @entity23			0
if you need new upholstered furniture or carpet , try to buy cotton or wool products , which contain no pbdes and are naturally fire resistant			0
and to limit your exposure to the @entity23 - laden material , do n't reupholster furniture that contains foam			2

polybrominated diphenyl ethers are *structurally* similar to @entity30
open you windows when you can to freshen the air
use air - conditioning filters with the highest minimum efficiency reporting value
