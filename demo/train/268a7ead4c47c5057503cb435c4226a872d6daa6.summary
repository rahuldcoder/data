@entity0 -- the same day a documentary that featured government whistle - blower @entity6 premiered , an @entity3 agent came to @entity6 's door for an audit			1
coincidence ? @entity6 does n't think so			0
now he 's taken his story to two congressional committees and a @entity12 watchdog , a sign that the @entity3 will face new scrutiny after its admission that employees improperly singled out applications for tax - exempt status by tea party groups for extra review			1
@entity6 retired from the @entity21 in 2010 after taking complaints about his agency to @entity24			2
six years earlier , he testified to a closed - door hearing into his complaints of ineptitude , favoritism and problems keeping marshals on flights			2
the same year he retired , he appeared in " please remove your shoes , " a documentary critical of the airline security measures travelers endure on every trip			0
an @entity3 agent showed up at his door " almost to the hour " that the movie bowed , he said			1
" being a veteran of extensive retaliation in my past , i am not surprised about this , " @entity6 told @entity1 's " @entity44 360			0
" " it is basically the only way they can retaliate against me after i retired			0
" @entity6 said his supervisors wrongly suspected he had been leaking reports of cutbacks by the service -- something for which another air marshal was later fired			1
he said his home was placed under surveillance , his cable lines were cut and he was taken off of flight duty to perform menial tasks around his office			0
" there i was in a suit and a tie , instead of being on a plane like i should be , painting scuff marks off the wall and washing cars , " he said			0
shifting @entity3 polls contradict key deposition the audit led to a yearlong investigation that included the placement of a $ 24,000 lien against his home			1
in the end , the @entity3 found out @entity6 owed them $ 480 -- while the government owed him $ 8,300			2
@entity6 paid his $ 480 ; the government never paid him , saying the statute of limitations had run out			0
after the may disclosure by the @entity3 that some of its employees had singled out conservative groups that had applied for tax - exempt status , resulting in lengthy delays in their applications being processed , @entity6 wrote to the @entity86 , which oversees the @entity3 , and the @entity87			1
he told them he now thinks someone -- perhaps the air marshal service , the @entity91 or elsewhere in the @entity93 administration -- was using the @entity3 to retaliate against him			1
when he raised his suspicions before , " i always received the same reply : ' the @entity3 would never do that -- that would be just too obvious -- you are just paranoid , ' " he told the @entity86			1
but now , " i do not believe the previous actions taken by the @entity3 were ' just a coincidence			2
' " and @entity6 may not be alone			0
the committee is now soliciting details from people who think they were targeted for their political beliefs			1
and he 's been contacted by investigators for the @entity12 inspector - general 's office that looked into the tea party complaints , indicating that probe may be heading in a new direction			1
@entity111 tries to keep focus on @entity3 targeting scandal " they wanted to know the history of my whistle - blowing , me testifying before @entity24 , " he said			1
" they wanted to get a whole history of my employment with the @entity21			0
they also wanted to find out the origin of the audits			0
they were very concerned with who actually pushed the button to start the audit			0
" in a statement issued to @entity1 , the @entity3 says federal law prohibits it from talking about the cases of specific taxpayers			2
but it says audits " are based on the information contained on the tax return and the underlying tax law -- nothing else			2
" " the audit process is handled by career , nonpartisan civil servants , and the @entity3 has processes in place to safeguard the exam process , " the agency said			1
" we strive to be vigilant in our efforts to provide the best taxpayer service and enforce the nation 's tax laws with fairness and integrity			1
" " while it is too early in this investigation to determine what all of the facts are , some reports received by the committee support claims the @entity3 was targeting taxpayers for their beliefs , " the committee told @entity1 in a written statement			1
@entity6 may be worried about being seen as paranoid , but at a congressional hearing focusing on the @entity164 issue , @entity161 @entity160 rep. @entity160 wondered whether the @entity3 scandal is just beginning			2
" is this still @entity167 ? " @entity160 asked			0
" is this government so drunk on power that it would turn its full force , its full might , to harass intimidate and threaten an average @entity167 who only wants his voice heard ? " @entity1 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report			0
