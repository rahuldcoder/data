-- for @entity2 , fascinating history is a loud discovery in a quiet library			1
the stories sneak up on him while he 's on other quests , such as the time @entity2 was trying to find the first @entity7 awarded a military medal and found @entity9 , a forgotten spy who saved @entity11 's life twice			1
@entity2 has collected the stories of 30 @entity13 left out of the history textbooks in his new book , " @entity17 : @entity13			1
" some other characters @entity2 brings to life include @entity20 , whose invention of " miracle rice " fed and supported @entity23 , @entity25 's steadfast endurance of 24 years of @entity27 captivity and @entity28 , whose medical organization on the battlefield revolutionized the treatment of wounded soldiers and saved countless lives during the @entity34			0
" these characters were relatively unknown , but what they did has had ripples that continue to affect us , " @entity2 said			0
" @entity9 saved the life of the father of our country			0
think of what would have happened if he had n't been a tailor in @entity45			0
" everyday @entity13 have had a huge impact on our history -- it is n't always presidents and generals who set the course for the country			1
" the characters called to him from the pages of history books , whispered from brief mentions of tv shows and clambered from the pages of historical society records , all begging to share their stories with someone who would listen			1
" @entity17 " is the latest offering in a continuous genre of books that aim to remind us of our forgotten past and changes how we understand it			1
@entity2 has lived through history and has been captivated by it			1
he worked as a journalist during the @entity73 , chronicling @entity75 's struggle to reconnect itself			0
then he worked for the @entity76 for 30 years , the last 10 as executive editor for @entity78			0
throughout the years , a single running theme has connected his experiences : lifting the underdog			0
unearthing forgotten stories from the country 's founding is a way to remind us what everyday people are capable of accomplishing			1
but why do people care today ? @entity89 , author of the famed " @entity91 ... " series and " @entity7 's @entity92 , " says that history is n't a dead thing of the past but an actively created and revised thing that affects our decisions every day			1
" in school , we focus on the ' important people ' and @entity100 , but what that ' great man version ' of history does is really leave out an awful lot of people who have tremendous impact , " @entity89 said			1
when @entity89 was in high school history class in 1968 , women , african - americans and native americans were noticeably absent from the textbook			1
revisionism is a dirty word to some , but @entity89 said it 's an important aspect of history			1
teachers and textbook writers still struggle today to include ethnic heritage , but some school districts aim to keep the same version of history we 've always been taught , case being @entity125 's suspension of @entity127 - @entity7 studies			1
" we need to revise history because we learn things all of the time about the stories and people who were left out , " he said			1
this is especially the case in elementary school history classes , he said			2
myths about @entity11 chopping down a cherry tree are taught in the place of truth , so history starts on a shaky foundation of fiction , @entity89 said			1
learning truth in the place of fiction later in high school makes history harder to grasp			2
" people want to paint a picture of the past that is filled with pride and patriotism , especially for children , and that is a valuable thing , " he said			2
" it gives us a sense of national identity and character , but it creates a very false history that is sanitized of the stories that do n't fit in neatly with the real history			2
" retired @entity7 history teacher @entity164 watched textbooks change dramatically during her 33 - year career			2
she does n't believe that children are necessarily taught " wrong " information at a young age , she said , but there 's an unbalanced emphasis on certain aspects of @entity7 history			2
" it would be difficult to deal with third - graders and @entity7 history 's real nuances of slavery , " she said			2
" it is in high school where we examine @entity181 as a paradox -- he owned slaves but was a complete champion of democracy			0
they are n't taught wrong , it 's just that they ca n't go into all of that detail at such a young age			0
" the emphasis on military history consumes the curriculum for high school history classes			2
the emphasis turned off students who wanted to learn more than dates and battles ; people , places and facts , not dates , make history come to life , @entity164 said			1
in her @entity205 @entity7 history class for 11th - graders , @entity164 included a " visitors " assignment for each era , where students played the part of important figures in @entity7 history and brought them to life in the classroom			2
books such as " @entity17 " can be a resource for teachers to use in this way , she said			0
it is this approach to teaching history that @entity223 , author of " @entity224 " and " @entity225 , " finds most beneficial to students			1
realizing that names and figures of the past were living , breathing human beings makes them as relatable as finding your grandfather 's address in the newly released the 1940 census documents , he said			0
@entity236 , son of second president @entity237 , is a prime example , @entity223 said			0
fact tells us that @entity237 walked out of the @entity241 and went skinny - dipping in the @entity243 each day			0
" it does n't change your understanding of @entity7 history , but suddenly that guy seems less like an old black - and - white photograph , and a little more like a person , " @entity223 said			0
" if you restrict yourself to the @entity252 version of history , you lose all of the color , delight and excitement of the adventure that is the lives of each one of these people			1
" because history is everything that ever happened , from every war to every love affair , the untold stories that turn expectations upside down are the ones worth exploring , @entity223 said			0
and because what we care about at 26 or 36 differs greatly from the portrait of our interest at 16 , discovering history for the first time a decade or two after high school can make those stories even more important			0
that is what @entity89 , @entity223 and @entity2 aim to remind us with their books , bursting with the people and places lost to time and rekindled in lifelike detail			1
every good story is one worth retelling , and our own history is full of them , many filled with the undeniable spirit and tenacity of the patriotic principles we learn from myths			0
" there really are two large categories of heroes , " @entity2 said of his book 's title			0
" most of us think of someone as a hero who risks his or her life when there is some immediate danger -- a soldier rescuing a fellow on the battlefield			0
" but the other type of hero is one who simply perseveres , who overcomes overwhelming odds , even if it might take an entire lifetime			0

authors : everyday @entity13 have influenced history as much as presidents , generals
reviving forgotten history allows people to connect with their pasts
author @entity89 believes history must be constantly revised
