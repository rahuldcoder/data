-- " wherever the olive tree grows , you wo n't find much tax being collected , " the mayor of a small town in southern @entity2 told me a few years ago			1
he shrugged ; such was life			0
he probably had no idea that some high - powered academics were about to come up with the same conclusion			0
when they analyzed @entity14 's " shadow economies " -- defined as areas that fall beyond the reach of the taxman -- those of @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity2 and @entity21 were much larger ( relatively ) than those in northern @entity14			1
that is partly because of the higher number of self - employed and family businesses , which tend to deal in cash and pay little tax			1
but to many economic commentators , tax evasion is also a national pastime in much of southern @entity14 , and a significant factor in the region 's burgeoning financial crisis			0
according to a 2007 paper by @entity36 economist @entity35 , the shadow economy in @entity20 accounted for 22.3 % of gross domestic product ( gdp ) , that of @entity2 19.3 % ; @entity21 19.2 % and @entity19 a staggering 25.1 %			1
by comparison , the @entity41 shadow economy was 7.2 % of gdp			2
a recent @entity44 report came up with similar figures			0
@entity46 mused several years ago that high tax rates in @entity20 made evasion a " natural right " for many			1
and the evidence does suggest that wherever tax rates and social security contributions are high , the shadow economy is larger			2
the @entity41 ambassador in @entity55 noted in a 2009 diplomatic cable published by @entity57 that @entity20 was " addicted both to profligate social welfare spending and to tax evasion			1
" and this year , industry minister @entity60 estimated " phantom " or undeclared income in @entity20 at a monstrous $ 320 billion			2
the @entity20 state -- whose debt has measured more than 100 % of gdp every year since 1992 -- is perennially poor , in a country of individual wealth that 's well hidden from the authorities			1
economy minister @entity69 recently told a conference that fewer than 800 people in @entity20 -- which is the world 's seventh - richest country -- had declared incomes of more than 1 million euros ( $ 1.4 million ) in 2010			1
that means the salaried middle class end up paying more			0
@entity69 is aiming to more than double the amount recovered from tax evasion within the next two years			0
a recently unveiled series of television commercials attacks the " parassita della societa " -- the parasites evading taxes , comparing them with malarial mosquitoes			0
even so , the @entity83 is not optimistic that @entity20 's " heavy reliance " on tackling tax evasion will be enough to balance the budget within two years			1
@entity19 pm optimistic about referendum until 2006 , national and local taxes in @entity20 were collected by banks and other private institutions			1
it was only five years ago that a single agency -- @entity93 -- was created to modernize tax collection			0
not that @entity20 have taken the agency to their hearts , with effigies of @entity93 sometimes hanged at public protests			2
the @entity20 media and activist groups say the agency has gone after the lower middle - class taxpayers for small tax debts , often forcing people into foreclosure , while tax evasion among the wealthy remains rampant			1
taxation in @entity20 also is a cumbersome business			2
for example , there are six different levels of taxation on diesel fuel -- from fishing boats to taxis and ambulances			0
and there are multiple agencies involved in tax assessment that are not famous for cooperating			0
but the price of not improving the government 's tax take may be high			0
until now @entity20 has been able to service its debt with relative comfort , but higher interest rates on its bonds may imperil that			2
the yield on @entity20 debt now exceeds 6 %			2
@entity19 is renowned for its history of tax evasion , estimated last year as worth 4 % of gdp -- $ 11 billion			1
it may be much more : the @entity131 has estimated that the government may be losing as much as $ 30 billion a year to tax evasion			0
a report by the @entity135 on @entity19 last year concluded that " to fight widespread tax evasion , a sustained and major effort to strengthen tax administration is necessary			1
particular emphasis should be placed on enforcement to ensure that those in the informal economy are brought into the tax net			0
" that apparently includes some prominent doctors in an up - market part of @entity147 , who declared incomes of less that $ 45,000 but had kids at private schools , and owned swimming pools , yachts and other visible signs of wealth			0
their names were published last year as part of a populist campaign by prime minister @entity158 to get tough with tax evaders			0
more embarrassment came when professor @entity161 -- former head of the prime minister 's economic department -- found that the farming town of @entity165 in @entity19 had more @entity166 per capita than any other city in the world			2
in an article , @entity161 noted : " the proliferation of @entity171 is a curiosity , given that farming is not a flourishing sector in @entity19 " and that declared incomes in @entity165 were very modest			2
@entity19 has revived an " @entity181 " and tried to improve tax collection as part of a multi-pronged initiative to cut the budget deficit			1
but collecting more taxes in the teeth of a savage recession is not easy			0
the opposition @entity185 has argued for lower tax rates combined with more effective action in tackling tax evasion			0
the influential @entity189 says in a recent paper that the @entity19 tax system is hopelessly broken			1
" tax and customs and excise evasion must be addressed head - on , " it says , while noting that former senior officials at the @entity194 had forecast " astonishingly , that even if all the tax - collecting authorities were shut down , state revenues would not suffer noticeably			2
" the @entity189 report says many officials had simply refused to carry out audits demanded by the @entity204 and concluded that the current tax authorities were " beyond salvation			0
" @entity2 has done more than most to tackle tax evasion , according to analysts , taking more tax cheats to court and gathering more data from bills and credit card records to pursue tax evaders			1
authorities have tracked down an estimated 200,000 individuals who had not declared income from rental properties , previously a massive source of tax evasion			0
five years ago the @entity2 @entity194 also launched an investigation to find out why a quarter of all high - denomination 500 - euro notes circulating in @entity14 were in @entity2			1
the answer -- they were handy for organized crime and as a way of evading taxes in @entity2 's booming ( but now busted ) construction industry			2
@entity2 began calling the 500 - euro note the ' @entity231 ' -- everyone knew what it stood for and what it looked like , but no one ever saw it			1
( @entity20 investigators have warned that the bank note was becoming popular with the mafia and adding to the problem of tax evasion			1
) the @entity2 government reaped more than $ 13 billion last year by clamping down on evasion -- 23 % more than in 2009			0
@entity2 's tax authorities have established special units to monitor the " offshoring " of revenues by companies and fraud in the real estate market			1
but groups like the @entity254 say 80 % of @entity2 's largest firms continue to harbor profits in tax havens			1
better tax collection is not going to solve the myriad of economic problems confronting the @entity262 countries , where extravagant state spending , inflexible labor markets , distorted competition policy and inefficient state enterprises have all contributed to the current crisis			0
but at a time when investors and lenders want to see " fiscal rectitude , " going after tax evaders is one of the easier ways of demonstrating intent .			0

" shadow economies " are defined as areas that fall beyond the reach of the taxman
they include self - employed and family businesses , which tend to deal in cash and pay little tax
for @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity2 and @entity21 , they represent sizable portions of the gdp
