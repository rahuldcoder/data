-- @entity1 will never forget his first time seeing " @entity3			0
" " i was 12 years old and it was beyond cool to see zombies attacking those hapless people , smashing in windows and feasting on human flesh , " @entity4 remembered			0
" no way would my real parents let me watch that sort of thing , but it was fine with my cool comic - shop - owning hippie other parents [ those parents being @entity19 and @entity20 , parents of @entity22 founder @entity21 ]			1
" ever since that day in 1976 , zombie movies were one of the @entity28 , @entity27 resident 's favorite genres			1
like many fans , he holds the original " @entity32 " in high regard : " except for one silly scene involving bikers throwing pies at zombies , the whole movie has great dramatic tension and a genuine feeling of horror , " he said			1
zombies have undergone a renaissance in recent years , starting with the remake of " @entity44 " in 2004 , and last year 's surprise hit horror - comedy " zombieland			0
" not only that , but " zombie walks " have cropped up all over the world lately , and they 're not just confined to events like @entity53 in @entity54			2
with vampires being all the rage -- with the " @entity59 " movie series and also tv 's " @entity60 " and " @entity62 " -- it seemed only natural that zombies would be next to get their own tv series			2
@entity65 , the home of emmy darlings " @entity68 " and " @entity69 , " has decided to adapt the comic book series " @entity71 , " set to premiere sunday , october 31 , at 10 p.m. et. ask anyone who has read the series , about a comatose @entity75 police officer who wakes up in the midst of a zombie apocalypse , and almost all of them will rave about it			1
thus , the expectations for the series are very high			2
@entity65 had an eye - catching display ( a gruesome re-creation of a scene from the first episode ) as part of their massive presence at @entity53			1
they also put on a zombie walk , which was expanded worldwide on tuesday			2
and , of course , the show has reached out to fans on social media , giving them oodles of information on the show before its debut			2
so what is it that makes fans so excited about this particular take on zombies ? " i enjoy the mix of characters , with many different ages and races represented , " @entity4 said			2
" they are a cross-section of people with varying skills , not a bunch of soldiers			0
they must come to grips with their new world and fight to survive in it			0
" " i think people love the source material because no character is sacred , no character is safe , and anyone -- even the most beloved and innocent people in the comic -- could be killed at any moment , " said @entity118 , comic book expert for @entity121 's " @entity120 " -- and one of many fans of the book 's creator , @entity124			1
" i hope the show manages to capture that sense of ever - present danger			0
" " we 're all big fans of the comics and have been reading them from the beginning , " said @entity138 of the @entity139 , @entity140 , area " @entity143 " comic book stores			1
" ' @entity71 ' and @entity124 's other series , ' invincible , ' sells very well in both our stores because we recommend it often			1
" one of his employees even tried out to play a zombie on the show , which shoots on location in @entity139			2
@entity154 of @entity155 , @entity156 , said the series got him back into reading comics after hearing so much about it : " it did not disappoint			0
it was more than just zombies			0
the stories were about people			0
they have complex relationships and as a reader you really identify with them , which makes it difficult when those characters die			0
" @entity118 agrees that the humanity of the characters are what sets it apart			0
according to the books , " human beings pushed to the limit -- people who have been reduced to their basest instincts to survive -- are far more terrifying than any zombie , " she said			1
those who have had a chance to see the show early are cautiously optimistic			1
" the first episode should make any fan giddy , " said @entity185 of @entity186			1
" that 's not to say that it 's a shot - for - page remake of the first part of the series , but there 's no doubt it 's respectably faithful			0
in fact , i 'd say the changes made in the first episode are for the better			0
" praising the show 's emphasis on humanity , not to mention its realistic makeup effects , @entity199 's @entity198 said it was " that rare adaptation which enhances everything that is great about its literary source material			0
" so , the question remains : will those who are n't as familiar with the comic book or who are n't already fans of the zombie genre tune in ? one thing " @entity71 " most certainly is ( as one might imagine ) , is extremely gory and violent			1
that would probably be tough for mass audiences , although it was n't much of a problem for " @entity218			1
" whether the show will garner the same popularity or critical praise as " @entity68 " or " @entity60 " remains to be seen			0
either way , members of its devoted fan base already have their plans made for @entity227 night .			1

new @entity65 series " @entity71 " has a *passionate* fan base
@entity233 zombie story is based on a series of popular comic books
fans who have had *sneak* peeks are cautiously optimistic
violence , gore could make it a tough sell to mass audiences
