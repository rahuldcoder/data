@entity0 -- president @entity2 and congressional leaders wrapped up their first " fiscal cliff " meeting since the election friday with a confident tone that had both sides suggesting an agreement could be reached before january 1 , when hefty federal spending cuts and tax raises are scheduled to take effect			2
" my hope is that this will be the beginning of a fruitful process , " said @entity2 , just prior to the meeting meant to avert the so - called fiscal cliff , which some economists warn could push the country into recession			2
" our challenge is to make sure that we can cooperate together , " he said			2
@entity23 and @entity24 leaders stood together after the @entity26 talks , while @entity26 speaker @entity27 said that @entity23 recognize that neither side is going to get everything it wants			1
he added that a combination of revenue increases and spending cuts is needed			0
" i believe that the framework that i 've outlined in our meeting today is consistent with the president 's call for a fair and balanced approach			0
to show our seriousness , we 've put revenue on the table -- as long as it 's accompanied by significant spending cuts , " @entity27 said			1
long the sticking point between the president and congressional @entity23 , increased revenue is sure to be at the center of any discussion			0
to the president , it means allowing @entity51 - era tax cuts on wealthy @entity52 to expire at the end of the year and returning to @entity55 - era rates for high - income earners			0
but to @entity23 , it has come to mean closing loopholes in the tax code and ending deductions without raising rates			0
for his part , senate majority leader @entity61 simply promised progress			1
" this is n't something we 're going to wait until the last day of december to get it done			1
we 're going to move forward on it , " he said			1
ahead of the meeting , members of the @entity72 , a group of centrists , sent a letter to @entity2 , @entity27 and @entity26 minority leader @entity76			1
" we can not have a full debate that allows us to address the multitude of issues facing our country if either side takes a potential solution off the table , " it said			1
with both parties suffering losses of moderate members in the election , this new coalition is signaling it could be a critical bloc of votes in getting a deal through the @entity26			1
@entity27 could potentially lose a chunk of votes from conservatives if final details on new revenue do n't meet their approval			2
major changes to entitlements could mean @entity76 would lose support from the progressives in the @entity26 who believe there should n't be any benefit cuts			1
@entity2 and vice president @entity105 met with @entity27 , @entity76 , @entity61 and @entity107 minority leader @entity106 in the @entity108 on friday			1
" we do n't happen to think that the government needs more revenue			2
government spends too much as it is , " @entity112 said on the @entity107 floor thursday			0
but he added that if @entity117 are willing to agree to reform entitlement programs , " we 'll be there			1
" @entity27 on wednesday acknowledged a " spirit of cooperation " between the two sides of the aisle in the @entity26 and the president , and he said he would remain optimistic			1
but as he 's done every time he 's publicly addressed the issue , the speaker restated his opposition to allowing any tax rates to go up			0
" there are ways to put revenue on the table without increasing tax rates , " he said			2
" we 've talked about this now for over a year			0
" the new @entity24 group 's letter was carefully crafted to avoid taking sides on any specific proposals on tax reform or structural changes to @entity140 , @entity141 or @entity142			0
it pointed out that bipartisan commissions have already drawn up plans that reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts and new revenue , but the group did n't endorse any one formula			2
and when leaders of the group were pressed to answer whether @entity117 would go along with significant changes to entitlement programs -- such as changing the eligibility age for @entity140 -- they did n't answer directly and instead said they remain open to everything			1
" at the very beginning , before we 've even sat down at the table , how about we agree that everything stays on the table until we 've had a chance to discuss it , " said rep. @entity158 , @entity159			2
earlier , @entity76 repeatedly said she wants to see a " grand bargain " -- the catch - all term for a major deficit reduction package that includes some combination of tax reform , spending cuts and entitlement reforms			0
but when asked what kind of entitlement changes she could accept , she said those programs should be dealt with separately from discussions about tax cuts			0
" those issues -- @entity142 , @entity140 , @entity141 -- they should be in their own realm			0
whatever adjustments would be made in @entity142 should be there to strengthen @entity142 , not to subsidize a tax cut for the wealthiest people in @entity52 and say that 's how we balance a budget			0
the same thing with @entity141 and @entity140 , " @entity76 said			0
rep. @entity188 , @entity189 , said the group " is n't trying to go around their own leadership " and wants to work with both parties			1
she said she was encouraged by what top @entity23 were saying on being open to new revenue , but she seemed to echo @entity76 on entitlements , saying they are part of a longer - term solution			2
rep. @entity200 of @entity201 , the incoming chairman of the @entity72 , insisted that no one should be drawing bright lines on any issue and compared fiscal cliff negotiations to those between @entity207 and @entity209 leaders			0
" we all know what we need to do -- it 's like the @entity214 peace plan			0
everyone knows where we need to end up ; we just need to figure out the political process to get there , " he said			0
the @entity72 grew after this month 's election , from 42 members to as many as 52 or 53 , depending on the results of the handful of unresolved @entity26 races			1
that equates to roughly one - quarter of the overall @entity226			0
similar to the " @entity232 " @entity117 , another group of fiscal conservatives who played a major role in health care negotiations , this group emphasizes bipartisan solutions			1
the ranks of the @entity235 , who hail mainly from @entity238 states , were decimated in the 2010 election , and the group will have fewer members -- about 15 -- heading into the next @entity242 after the retirement of several members			0
a challenge facing moderate @entity117 is they do n't wield significant power in the leadership			1
@entity76 and the rest of the current leadership are expected to stay essentially the same in the next @entity242			0
while no. 2 democrat @entity252 is viewed as more ideologically moderate , and often is the bridge to those members , the rest of the leaders have ties to the more liberal elements of the caucus			2
the new @entity117 do have the potential of gaining a seat at the leadership table -- its current chairman , rep. @entity261 of @entity262 , is vying for the post of vice chairman of the caucus , against rep. @entity266 of @entity267 and rep. @entity268 of @entity269			1
several @entity117 aides expect @entity261 to win the spot when the elections are held after @entity273 .			1

new : @entity61 : " this is n't something we 're going to wait until the last day of december to get it done "
some moderate @entity26 @entity117 are sending a *message* to both parties
they say they want neither side to take " a potential solution off the table "
the coalition signals it could be critical to getting a deal through the @entity26
