-- years ago , a friend of mine considered getting a mobile phone , but he opted for a car phone instead			2
he just could n't imagine needing to call someone when he was walking around			2
as humans , we often have a hard time seeing the significance of new technologies			2
when the telephone came out , the telegraph companies dismissed it as " idiotic			2
" many of the first television programs consisted of people reading radio scripts			1
according to popular legend , @entity18 of @entity19 once declared that the worldwide market for computers was " five			2
" when the web arrived , it was like an entirely new dimension			1
it allowed us to publish things into " cyberspace , " where anyone could see them			2
we could instantly pull up facts on any topic			2
soon e-commerce emerged , allowing us to research products , buy things with one click and track our shipments in real - time			1
social networks allowed us to publish profiles and learn about others in ways never before possible			1
it was a cambrian explosion of knowledge			2
to this day , we struggle to remember what life was like without it			2
should we fear mind - reading future tech ? the physical world , by comparison , is pre-internet			1
each day we walk past buildings wondering what they are			2
we wait at busy intersections , hoping that a taxi will eventually come our way			0
we go to clothing stores blindly hoping to find things we like , and we cross paths with thousands of people , knowing nothing about them			1
for some reason this does not seem weird to us			0
it has always been this way			0
for the second time in as many decades , a new dimension is opening up			0
the mobile phones that once seemed so useless are now everywhere			0
and they are powerful -- with gps receivers , gyroscopes , accelerometers , and proximity sensors			0
they can speak to other databases , access the internet , and publish things into the air above our heads			0
it 's a new type of spatial web : one that gives us real - time data about the people , places and things physically around us			1
mapping and local search apps like @entity88 have been popular since the early days of the @entity89			0
more recently , improvements in battery life and location technology have given rise to services like @entity95 and @entity96 , which let you request a ride and track your driver as a moving dot on a map , coming to pick you up			0
@entity102 and @entity103 do similar things for local errands , and @entity106 lets you book a last minute hotel nearby with the tap of a button			0
this new web is also changing the way we socialize			1
imagine if you could see information about the people standing near you			1
your phone could notify you when friends were nearby , help you remember people 's names , and surface the hidden connections you have with others in the room			1
just by looking at someone you could know all about them			0
this is what we are building at @entity128			0
do our mobiles own us ? new hardware devices like @entity131 and @entity132 will be the early browsers of this spatial web , allowing us to see this information without pulling out our phones			1
eventually it 'll move to contact lens overlays			0
with improved battery life and storage technology , we 'll be able to capture our entire lives on video ( or some equivalent ) and recall the past at any time			0
imagine being able to go back to the first moment you met your wife or relive a family vacation you took when you were eight years old			1
the social , legal , and psychological implications are just staggering			1
so how do we feel about this shift ? it 's been fascinating to see how people react to highlight			1
at first , the idea of sharing a profile with the people around you is a bit jarring to some			1
it 's not because we are inherently opposed to the idea			0
it 's because we 've never even had to consider it			0
it just has n't been possible until now			0
just like with the @entity164 , we need to figure out how we want to use this technology			0
what things do we want to share ? what should the social norms be ? what privacy settings do we want ? the potential of this technology is tremendous			1
knowing more about the world around you just makes life better			1
it makes you more informed and educated			1
it saves time and reduces inefficiencies			0
most importantly , it makes people friendlier			1
they smile more , talk more , see the hidden connections around them			0
in another decade , we are going to look back and wonder how we ever got by without this , and how we lived for so long blind to the world around us			2
i am excited for that day to come			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

new tech has always been met with doubt , *criticism* but in the end , real - world *application* *prevails* , says @entity191
@entity132 and @entity131 will be the first to combine the physical world and the web
@entity191 argues this new tech creates more social people who are more informed and educated
