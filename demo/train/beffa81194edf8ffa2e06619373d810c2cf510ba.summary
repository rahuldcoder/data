@entity0 -- trust the carriers of the @entity3 to cause mischief again			1
having already destroyed the economics of the cosy international airline world , previously dominated by the @entity8 airlines , now the gulf carriers seem set to mess up the airline alliances too			1
all the major @entity8 airlines are now part of one of the three big alliances			2
there is @entity16 ( the biggest ) based around @entity17 and @entity18 ; @entity19 based around @entity21 / @entity20 and @entity22 ; @entity23 based around @entity24 and @entity25			0
read more : how would you save @entity25 ? the gulf airlines have until now eschewed the alliances			1
firstly because competitively the alliances did n't want them , and secondly because they were growing very nicely , thank you , without them			2
the reality is the three gulf carriers , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 are forces with which to be reckoned			1
strategic investments by co-operative governments have given them large fleets and huge airports			0
they have created a flourishing environment while established carriers languish			2
where @entity0 , @entity46 and @entity47 were the traditional change - hubs , today @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 are perfectly placed at the crossroads of east and west			0
they are able to open up vast new markets in the @entity58 and @entity59 continent , as anyone who has been in those airports in the middle of the night can see			0
over the past year the gulf airlines have expanded their investments and routes and in doing so are slowly disrupting , some say destroying , the airline alliances			1
it is oneworld that is feeling the effects most			2
first , @entity72 's @entity37 bought an equity stake in @entity74 , a oneworld member			1
that deal raised eyebrows but it is workable within the alliance			0
then , rival @entity80 's @entity35 set up a 10 - year partnership with @entity82 -- another oneworld member -- which will clearly have major implications on relations with other alliance members such as @entity24 and @entity87			1
but everyone put a brave face on it			0
ailing @entity82 announces alliance with @entity35 today @entity93 's @entity92 joins oneworld and comes within the fold			1
so , all three gulf carriers are now , in some shape or form , in bed with oneworld airlines			1
that would be confusing enough , but now another nail has been hammered into the alliance coffin			0
@entity23 's @entity74 ( and its paymaster @entity37 ) is entering a relationship with @entity21 / @entity20 , a member of @entity19			1
and it 's not just a codeshare , but a long - standing strategic tie - up			0
how on earth can a oneworld @entity74 do a strategic tie up with the leading carrier in a rival airline and keep its loyalty to oneworld ? even allowing for the fact oneworld is a looser federation of airlines than @entity16 , this is a nonsense			1
the oneworld members are now either in bed with rival gulf carriers or hitched to rival alliance members in strategic partnerships			1
it beggars belief to think that oneworld can be more than a frequent flyer earn - and - burn alliance under those circumstances			0
the one who has most right to be annoyed is @entity93 at @entity36			0
once he is a full member he can rightly ask after the loyalties of @entity82 and @entity74			1
are they to his airline as a oneworld member ? or to @entity35 and @entity37 as their respective partners ? we know the answer			2
more quest : @entity140 's president on the @entity142 ' economic problems @entity80 at @entity35 has always said the alliances ' days are numbered			1
at this year 's @entity145 conference he sparked a lively debate with the view that the alliances were passed their sell by date because they could n't address the competitive demands of today 's market			2
they were a creation of necessity because global airlines can not legally consolidate			0
however , as we are now seeing , the gulf carriers are either joining the alliances ( @entity36 ) picking them off one by one ( @entity35 ) or simply creating split loyalties ( @entity37 )			2
i predict that @entity74 will eventually leave oneworld and join @entity19 to tidy up its relationship			1
i predict @entity82 will slowly but surely drift away from oneworld but keep one foot in the camp because of its relationship with @entity25 and @entity142 routes			0
and i predict @entity16 loses @entity169 's @entity168 to oneworld next year			2
and throughout all of this the gulf carriers continue doing ad hoc deals where necessary ( @entity35 talking to @entity25 , for instance ) and re-writing the rules			1
the point here is that the gulf carriers are in the left seat			0
they have the planes , the hubs , the connections and are opening up the new markets			0
now the alliances have to learn how to deal with it			0
it wo n't be pretty			0
more quest : @entity187 on why @entity8 federation is ' unavoidable '			0

@entity1 's @entity190 says the carriers of the @entity3 are causing mischief again
they have eschewed airline alliances but are forces with which to be reckoned
quest predicts changes *including* @entity74 leaving oneworld
throughout it all the @entity3 carriers will continue doing ad hoc deals where necessary
