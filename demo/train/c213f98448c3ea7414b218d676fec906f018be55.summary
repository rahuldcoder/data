-- a new report from the @entity2 lists the cities that have the worst air pollution in the @entity5 places in @entity7 and the @entity8 , including @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , top the list			1
but @entity14 , @entity15 and even @entity16 are also offenders			0
part of the problem stems from policy failures in @entity21			1
of course , local governments are at fault as well			0
in @entity7 , cars and trucks contribute heavily to the problem , as is also true in cities like @entity27			1
@entity9 pioneered urban sprawl and the car culture and is now paying the price			0
but it 's not alone : @entity32 , @entity33 , and others are also sprawled across the countryside			0
@entity5 cities have not done enough to get people out of cars and onto mass transit			1
as detailed in " @entity43 , " a recent book by @entity42 , @entity9 focused too much on subways and not enough on trolleys and dedicated bus lanes			0
to make matters worse , the routes were often in the wrong places due to political interference from the city council through the state capital to @entity53			0
it 's not realistic to expect that something as major as transportation infrastructure will be immune from politics , but rational planning needs to play a bigger role than it has in the past			0
@entity9 's specific problems were its own , but mass transit is in need of more support and better implementation across the nation			1
all too often , support for mass transit is portrayed as a wasteful subsidy because its benefits to the public are misunderstood			1
the federal government has sometimes failed to do enough to fight air pollution			1
under the @entity76 administration , especially , industry succeeded in using federal laws as a shield against state regulation			0
for instance , cities have been blocked from addressing pollution from older , dirtier trucks			1
when one port authority tried to prohibit dirtier trucks from using its facilities , the @entity84 held this effort violated a federal law deregulating prices and routes in the trucking industry			2
it was probably a surprise to @entity53 that the effort to allow markets to control this industry gave the industry special immunity from the kinds of pollution regulations that apply to every other industry			2
obviously , other cities also have their own high - polluting trucks , and they are similarly stymied			1
lawsuits have also prevented cities from modernizing fleet vehicles such as cabs			2
when one @entity109 air quality district tried to make fleet vehicles such as cab companies buy only the cleaner vehicles on the market			1
although this would have been a significant step toward improving air quality in a heavily polluted area , the @entity84 ruled that the air district was violating federal law			1
this ruling has had ripple effects elsewhere in the country , like @entity123 , where federal courts have blocked efforts to upgrade its cab fleet			0
some say electric cars are the future			2
but when electric cars were first introduced , the @entity76 administration took the very unusual step of getting involved and siding with industry			2
it was n't until @entity76 left office that @entity7 was able to make a bigger push for electric cars			2
the delayed introduction of electric vehicles is bad for the @entity5 state regulators , even with the best intentions , ca n't go it alone			2
they need local governments to help combat sprawl and support mass transit			1
the @entity147 has an obvious role to play in addressing pollution , and it needs to be more effective			2
new federal regulations on pollution from electric power plants are a long - overdue step in the right direction			0
hopefully , @entity147 will also tighten ozone standards during its next review			0
but at the same time that the federal government is trying to do more , it is ironic to see federal law used to block state pollution controls			0
air pollution these days is a deceptive problem			1
people know that some days are hazy and leave their eyes irritated			0
what they do n't realize is that these problems are only the tip of the iceberg			0
air pollution results in more respiratory illness , more trips to the @entity173 , and more deaths			1
according to @entity147 estimates , its program to reduce cross-state pollution ( which the @entity84 upheld recently ) will save 14,000 - 34,000 lives per year			0
we 've made real progress should not become complacent over this major public health issue			1
we need to redouble our efforts .			0
