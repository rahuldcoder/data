-- could we one day live underwater ? ask @entity3 -- a month from now			1
@entity3 , grandson of underwater explorer @entity4 , is spending the rest of june in @entity7 , the world 's only underwater marine lab , 63 feet beneath the ocean 's surface near @entity12 , @entity13			1
@entity3 and a small team of researchers -- they like the term " aquanauts " -- will spend the month living together in cramped quarters while studying how climate change and pollution affect ocean life			1
the monthlong operation is called @entity24 , named for the number of days they will live underwater			1
" i hope this will spawn a new focus on ocean exploration , whether it 's living in a habitat or beyond , " said @entity3			1
he 'll be assisted by more than 30 support staff , including filmmakers and researchers from @entity35 , which operates the @entity7 lab. " it takes 24 people topside just to have six people down below for 31 days , just like @entity40 does for the @entity41 , " @entity3 said			1
some 50 years ago , @entity4 and a team of underwater researchers lived for a record 30 days in an ocean lab known as @entity45 at the bottom of the @entity47			1
with @entity24 , @entity3 hopes to honor his grandfather 's legacy while beating his record by one day			1
the project also marks the first opportunity for fans to follow an underwater @entity4 expedition in real time			1
thanks to internet connectivity inside @entity7 , @entity3 hopes to reach millions of people through @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 chats and classroom sessions via streaming video at mission - 31.com			1
we had a rare opportunity to visit @entity4 as he was undertaking his mission and get a glimpse of @entity7 , a lab that has been used by @entity40 astronauts in pre-mission training			1
the 81 - ton lab sits on stilts and resembles some kind of underwater machinery that 's covered with algae , barnacles and other growths			2
schools of fish , a stingray , tarpons , a nurse shark and a 300 - pound grouper cruise by as we descend the 63 feet to the lab. we enter through something called a moon pool , a small chamber that leads to the entrance of @entity7			1
going quickly from underwater to inside , we begin breathing normal air , but our bodies are still pressurized , so they 're reacting to dive - like conditions underwater			2
because of that , our time is limited before we have to go to the surface			2
at 400 square feet , the lab is the size of a small studio apartment			2
the air conditioning is broken , and you can feel the humidity			0
" you might find this to be a little weird and trippy , but i actually feel at home down here , " @entity3 said upon greeting us			2
i could n't imagine a better house than one under sea			0
" looking around , we see packets of dehydrated food and chips , which will feed the crew , who ca n't cook anything			0
to heat a pan could cause a spark , which is too risky with all the flammable oxygen around			0
but while the meals are basic , the technology is advanced			0
the lab and control room are equipped with @entity122 , which lets @entity4 use @entity59 and remain in contact with the world above			2
there are @entity127 cameras and dozens of @entity128 , along with numerous computers			0
there 's also a refrigerator and a half - dozen bunk beds			2
a few personal mementos , like family snapshots , are sprinkled around			0
there are many things scientists already know about what happens when humans spend a lot of time underwater			2
after about 10 days , for example , you start to lose your sense of taste			0
your hair grows faster , your voice is higher -- due to atmospheric pressure -- and for some reason you ca n't whistle ( try and you will fail )			0
after scuba diving for six to eight hours a day , you sleep like a baby			0
that may be helpful , considering @entity3 's team is conducting the longest underwater sleep study to date			1
their sleep cycles are monitored constantly with smartwatches			0
while all this research is important , there 's one question that still lingers : what is the point of a mission like this ? @entity3 said it 's about more than just breaking records			1
" i hope i am a firestarter , because at the end of the day , who would n't want to be an aquanaut ? " he said			0
" i mean , this is just an amazing place			0
it 's our final frontier			0
we 've explored less than 5 % of our oceans , so there 's a lot left to do out there			0

@entity3 is living in a marine lab 63 feet beneath the ocean 's surface near @entity13
@entity4 is a grandson of underwater explorer @entity4
mission 31 is named for the number of days his team will live underwater
they will study how climate change and pollution affect ocean life
