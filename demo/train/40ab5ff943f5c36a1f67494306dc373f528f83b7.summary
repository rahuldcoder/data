with internet use expected to boom in @entity3 in coming years -- internet penetration is currently only around 5 % , according to @entity16 , but he said the arrival of 3g services means that many of the country 's 600 million mobile phone users will soon be online -- entrepreneurs are seeking new ways to tap the online matchmaking market			1
one start - up , @entity44 , set up by three 20 - something @entity45 , is hoping to persuade @entity3 that the future of online matchmaking is in group dating			1

@entity16 added : " @entity3 is a conservative and traditional society , where people stay with their parents until they 're married and there 's not much room for personal lives			2
women in particular find it difficult to openly date			0

their move into @entity3 was almost accidental			0

women are saying that going out in a group makes them feel safer			0
" he added that @entity44 is considering dropping the word dating from the site to make it more socially acceptable			2
" one challenge we face is that we call ourselves group dating , " said @entity74			1
" there 's a stigma or taboo about the concept of dating that makes people cautious			0
" @entity16 agreed that going out in groups was more socially acceptable in @entity3 than one - on - one dating , but still doubted many women would be willing to post profiles online			1
he said : " i think group dating is a good idea because it 's a safer way of dating for @entity83 markets			1
however , i do n't see it working in @entity3 because i ca n't imagine @entity3 women doing it in any numbers			0
" he said that most profiles on matrimonial sites are created by fathers and brothers , rather than women themselves , and that 80 % of @entity3 internet users are male			1

" people sometimes use @entity142 and @entity143 as pseudo-dating sites to browse friends of friends and reach out to them , but mostly they do n't make friends with complete strangers			0
" @entity54 added that @entity3 would be reluctant to pay for a group dating site when they can use @entity142 for free			1
he said : " first of all , credit card penetration is low , especially among the age group for dating sites			1
secondly , @entity3 will be hesitant to pay for something they can get for free on @entity142			0
" @entity159 is n't deterred			0
he 's currently in @entity3 recruiting staff for an @entity3 office , which will carry out focus groups to better tailor @entity44 to an @entity3 market			2
