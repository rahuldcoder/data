-- for the last 20 years , what name is always in the top 100 most popular baby names given to boys in the @entity4 ? @entity5 ( pronounced hey - seus )			1
and among 4,500 boys names in @entity8 in 2009 , what was the no. 1 most popular baby name ? @entity11			0
and what do babies and their names have to do with the global economy ? everything			0
the currency of the future is babies , because babies grow up to be taxpaying workers			2
let 's do @entity26 101 , which is basically the study of baby - making			0
demographers have a fancy term called " total fertility rate , " which measures the average number of babies a woman has over her childbearing years			0
the magic number you need to remember is 2.1			0
this is the average number of babies a country needs to remain at equilibrium			0
it makes sense , too			0
when a mother and father die , they need to be replaced by two babies , or else the population declines			2
a rich powerful country needs lots of babies to project geopolitical power and increase its productivity			2
if you wo n't multiply , who will fight your wars ? who will pay @entity58 to support grandpa ? who do you think will start the next @entity61 , @entity62 or @entity63 ? the @entity4 total fertility rate is at 2.09 , and at that level we just replace our population			1
but wait a minute , why do we keep growing ? simple : immigration			0
our favorable immigration policy and liberal treatment of the millions of people working without legal documents means our population will grow from 312 million today to 439 million in 2050			1
hispanic babies , 83 million of them , will account for 65 % of that @entity76 this is where the total fertility rate comes into play again , 2.84 for @entity80 , but only 1.84 and trending much lower for non-hispanic whites who will only add 4 million babies to the melting pot. keep in mind that those @entity75 babies born here to @entity88 's " self - deportation " candidates are all red - blooded @entity4 citizens -- our future @entity90 , entrepreneurs , middle - class working @entity4 and maybe even a president			1
@entity26 will shape the geopolitics of the two largest economies of the 21st century : the @entity4 and the @entity96			1
they will maintain their status as world powers principally through immigration			2
@entity4 politicians voted thursday to possibly saddle our grandkids with $ 16.4 trillion in debt , but @entity104 politicians trying to fix their debt quagmire do n't have grandkids to stick it to			1
@entity104 is dying as its nations run out of babies			1
three - quarters of @entity104 live in societies with fertility rates below 1.5			1
in the 14th century , the bubonic plague wiped out 75 million people ; and in the 21st century , a larger number will be lost in @entity104 through demographic suicide			1
@entity104 's demographic meltdown means it has to turn to immigrants for its workforce , and the vacuum is being filled by @entity122			1
from 1990 to 2010 , the @entity122 population of @entity104 grew from 30 million to 44 million			1
it will reach 58 million by 2030 and 10 @entity104 countries will be more than 10 % @entity122			1
while a spirit of integration and tolerance is central to the beliefs of the vast majority of @entity122 , a radical , well - funded @entity127 minority rejects tolerance , democracy and women 's rights			0
this militant @entity127 tumor has metastasized to intimidate , marginalize and silence moderate @entity122 who share the values of a democratic culture			0
without @entity139 , @entity104 will die			2
to survive , its leaders need to work with moderate @entity122 to neutralize fundamentalist views and challenge anti-immigration voices			2
if @entity104 is unable to reform its immigration policies , then the geopolitical ramification is obvious : a neutered @entity146 alliance unable to project military and economic power			1
the @entity4 faces its own evolving relationship with immigrants , one that is defined by widely contrasting views as to how they should be integrated into society -- or not			1
fears that immigrants will not assimilate are not new			0
we certainly have not lost our capacity to welcome and absorb newcomers , as @entity4 has since its birth			2
a recent survey by @entity160 asked immigrants in @entity4 how long it took them to feel comfortable and part of the community			1
seventy - seven percent said it took less than five years			0
@entity80 are every bit as @entity4 as anyone else -- they are white , brown and black			2
they are self - reliant with strong family values and highly religious			0
for 92 % of @entity80 , @entity170 is an active force in their daily lives : 66 % are catholic , 25 % are @entity173 and 1 % are @entity175 or other denominations			0
@entity80 are also very patriotic			0
more than 25 % of the 58,195 names on the @entity177 are @entity75 , and one of the first people to die in the @entity180 was @entity182 @entity181 , who entered the @entity4 illegally and was granted citizenship posthumously			1
while @entity75 immigrants are accused of driving down wages , economic studies have found the opposite to be true			1
conducting research on the effects of immigration on wages over the span of a decade for the @entity193 , @entity194 , of the @entity195 , and @entity196 , of the @entity197 , found that nearly 90 % of native born @entity4 workers actually enjoy higher wages because of immigration			2
they found that immigrants have a positive impact on the @entity4 economy because they differ in their educational and skill levels from @entity4 natives , and because more workers in the labor force increases productivity and stimulates the creation of businesses			1
the sustainable competitive advantage of @entity4 over any other country is that we do immigration best			2
no one can touch our capacity to integrate and assimilate people from all cultures			0
it keeps us young , strong and dynamic			0
the benefits of immigration are often taken for @entity223 work hard			1
they spend money and pay taxes			1
they take care of children so parents can work			0
and the number of immigrants on welfare is far lower than anti-immigration advocates would have us believe			0
as the arrows fly about immigration reform , legislators and voters alike can either accept immigrants , of all faiths , as the incontrovertible engines for economic growth they are -- or we can fight the future and the facts and shoot ourselves in the foot instead			1
some choose to believe that we are being overrun by lazy immigrants that strain our welfare system			0
yet every @entity4 should know by now that immigrants are the lifeblood of our future strength and economic power			1
and for that , we should thank a baby named @entity5			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			2

@entity266 : *western* nations need to grow in population to maintain power
@entity266 says more and more *muslims* are in @entity104 and will fuel growth
@entity266 : in @entity4 , @entity75 and other immigrants are an economic growth engine
immigrants work hard , form strong families , pay taxes and are patriotic , he writes
