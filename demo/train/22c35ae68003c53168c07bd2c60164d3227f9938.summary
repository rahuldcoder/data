-- within 24 hours , @entity2 's statue at @entity3 came down and his record as the winningest coach at the top level of college football disappeared			1
the steps by @entity3 president @entity9 and the @entity10 drew sharply differing reactions monday			1
they are the latest impact from a child sex - abuse scandal now linked forever to the university 's storied football program			0
@entity2 's family and diehard @entity3 loyalists condemned the penalties as an overzealous response that unfairly targeted the former coach , who died of lung cancer in january after being fired the previous november to end his 46 - year career at the university			1
' @entity26 wake - up call ' with $ 60 million fine for @entity3 " the sanctions announced by the @entity10 today defame the legacy and contributions of a great coach and educator without any input from our family or those who knew him best , " said a statement by the @entity2 family			1
the @entity10 sanctions included a $ 60 million fine against @entity3 , a four - year ban from bowl games and the loss of 20 football scholarships			1
perhaps most painful to the @entity2 family and his fans was the removal of 14 seasons of football victories , covering 1998 - 2011 , which cost @entity2 the record as winningest coach in @entity52 history			1
why is @entity10 taking sex abuse more seriously than the @entity54 ? " in our minds and hearts , those victories are still there and they still count , which is what makes him a great coach , " said @entity3 graduate @entity55 , who heads the university 's alumni association chapter in @entity58			1
the sanctions came a day after the university removed the 900 - pound bronze statue of @entity2 from outside @entity70 on the @entity72 campus , saying it had become a symbol of division			2
the punishments follow an independent investigation , led by former fbi director @entity77 , of the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach @entity79 , who was convicted in late june of 45 of the 48 counts he faced involving 10 young victims			0
do sanctions alter history books on @entity3 and @entity2 's legacy ? @entity77 's report held four top @entity3 officials , including @entity2 , responsible for failing to stop the abuse			1
that failure began in 1998 , according to the report			0
@entity2 's family called the penalties premature and challenged the veracity of @entity77 's investigation			1
" how @entity79 was able to get away with his crimes for so long has yet to be fully understood , despite the claims and assertions of the @entity77 report , " said the @entity2 family 's statement			2
it also called the acceptance of the @entity10 penalties by university officials and the board of trustees without a hearing " an abdication of their responsibilities and a breach of their fiduciary duties to the university and the 500,000 alumni			1
" former @entity3 president : i was abused as a kid , would n't ignore @entity79 allegations " punishing past , present and future students of the university because of @entity79 's crimes does not serve justice , " the @entity2 family 's statement said			1
" this is not a fair or thoughtful action ; it is a panicked response to the public 's understandable revulsion at what @entity79 did			2
" others with strong ties to the @entity3 community also condemned the @entity10 sanctions			1
" we expected large sanctions but this is overkill , " said @entity134 , president of the @entity135 of the @entity136 , in a e-mail to @entity0			2
@entity134 praised some of the penalties , such as $ 60 million the university will give to groups helping victims of child sex abuse , but he argued that the cut in football scholarships and four - year ban from bowl games " benefit nobody			2
" " it hurts our student athletes that need grants , " @entity134 's e-mail said			0
across the @entity155 , @entity55 said the penalties unfairly target the future of the football program that he described as vital to the university			0
experts : what happens to @entity3 football ? " i do n't see the program recovering in the next 10 to 15 years , " he told @entity0 by telephone , adding that " by essentially taking away the main pillar of the university , you are almost pulling the university down			0
" on social media , some players wrote they would return next season as a team with a mission			0
" @entity3 vs @entity176 - day 1 - , " tweeted tight end @entity175			0
former players , meanwhile , rejected the 111 canceled victories by the @entity10 that dropped @entity2 's total from a record 409 to 298			1
" they can take away whatever games they want to , i know i was apart of win 400 , 409 and all the other games we won while at @entity3 , " posted former wide receiver @entity184 on @entity185			0
supporters of the tough sanctions sounded equally vehement , at least according to online comments to @entity0			2
" i don ( ' ) t think the defenders of @entity2 and @entity3 here fully comprehend the barely imaginable severity of the crimes that were committed , " wrote a reader with the online handle @entity190			2
" not just crimes by @entity79 , but by nearly all of @entity3 's football and academic leadership			2
this was ( literally ) institutional sanctioning of child rape for the continued benefit of the football team			0
i can not think of anything lower or more despicable			0
@entity3 is getting what they deserve			0
" opinion : was @entity10 too quick to punish @entity3 ? @entity9 and other top @entity3 officials said they accept the @entity10 penalties			1
" with today 's announcement and the action it requires of us , the university takes a significant step forward , " @entity9 said in a written statement , while acting athletic director @entity210 added that the path ahead " will not be easy , but it is necessary , just , and will bring a better future			0
" @entity134 , who leads the oldest of the university 's scores of alumni associations around the world , disagreed			0
" @entity9 and any one else who signed off on these sanctions should resign today , " said @entity134 's e-mail to @entity0			0
while the university removed @entity2 's statue from public view , the university library that bears his name will remain unchanged			1
to @entity55 , the university is trying to get rid of @entity2 's football legacy while conserving his academic legacy			1
he complained of media coverage that focused solely on the @entity79 scandal and @entity2 's failure to intervene while ignoring how @entity2 required his players to succeed in the classroom as well as on the football field			1
" anybody who 's gone to @entity3 , that 's something that really is going to bother " them , he said			2
@entity55 , who completed six years at @entity3 in 2008 with a graduate degree in aerospace engineering , said he has kept in touch with college friends by phone and e-mail ever since			0
the main topic is always the same -- @entity3 football			0
" once you graduate , " he explained , " it ties back to the football program			0
" sanctions : who pays the price ? do you think the @entity10 penalties against @entity3 were fair ? share your view with @entity262			1
@entity0 's @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's family says the @entity10 penalties " defame " the coach 's legacy
@entity2 fans say the penalties are overkill and hurt the wrong *people*
overall , public opinion appears to support the tough sanctions
the @entity10 fines @entity3 , strips @entity2 of the victory record , and cuts scholarships
