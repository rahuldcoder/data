-- chief clerk @entity1 was convicted of stealing six bags of gold coins -- worth $ 30,000 -- from the @entity4 in @entity5 in 1901			1
more than 100 years later , a @entity7 couple unearthed a secret stash of coins , with a combined face value of about $ 28,000			1
most were minted in @entity5			1
coincidence ? sure is , said @entity11 , spokesman for the @entity4			1
" we do not have any information linking the @entity15 coins to any thefts at any @entity4 facility , " he told @entity0			1
the spokesman was responding to the latest wave of speculation that kicked off after the @entity20 published a report monday , suggesting a turn - of - the - century heist could explain the possible provenance of the coins			1
separately , @entity11 told the newspaper : " we 've done quite a bit of research , and we 've got a crack team of lawyers , and trust me , if this was @entity31 government property we 'd be going after it			1
" the coins from the 1901 heist were never found			1
the so - called @entity15 was discovered by a husband and wife in february 2013 on their property in @entity7			1
though the coins have a face value of approximately $ 28,000 , experts believe they could fetch in excess of $ 10 million			1
the treasure is known as the @entity15 because it was discovered near a hill the couple called @entity45			2
a golden mystery the husband and wife were walking their dog when they spotted something metal on the ground			0
they dug and eventually discovered eight metal cans , containing more than 1,400 gold coins			1
restoring and cleaning the coins has taken months			2
no one knows how they got there , or whom the coins might have belonged to			2
@entity63 , of @entity64 , is assisting the owners , who wish to remain anonymous			2
" the best theory is that -- and this is collaborated somewhat with doing some research , title searches , etc. from back in 1800s -- that someone in the mining business , as he got his remuneration , his bonuses , whatever , he would take the gold from the banks and put it into the ground in these cans , " he told @entity0			2
" back then , they did n't always trust the banks			0
" @entity63 dismissed the idea that the coins could be connected to the turn - of - the - century heist			0
" if you had robbed the @entity4 in 1901 , you 'd have 1901 , 1900 , 1899 coins			1
but instead what you have here are coins from 1894 and before , " he said			0
" we vetted this long time ago			1
we know the story of @entity1			0
the only thing that is remotely similar is the amount of value			0
" the coins , in $ 5 , $ 10 and $ 20 denominations , date from 1847 to 1894			2
many are in pristine condition , including at least 14 coins that are considered the finest known for their date and mint mark			2
a highlight from the hoard is an 1866 - @entity104 , valued at close to $ 1 million			0
" nothing resonates like buried treasure , " @entity63 said , as a smile broke across his face			0
" these are not just coins , but they are artifacts			0
they tell a story ... they speak to us			0
it 's like holding history in your hands			0
" the couple is planning to sell most of the collection			0
some will be sold on @entity63 's website , but most on @entity123 , probably in may			0
" unlike other hoards and treasures , this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years , and many of the coins are still in pristine condition , " @entity63 said			0
" and add to that a wonderful human interest story : this family literally found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow			0
" these coins could change history rare coin collection set to make a mint bought for $ 3 at yard sale , bowl sells for $ 2.2 million @entity144 hooks statue of ancient @entity147 god @entity148 @entity0 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			1
