-- scientists in the @entity2 have discovered the largest ever under - ice bloom of phytoplankton , likening the discovery to " finding the @entity7 rainforest in the middle of the @entity9			1
" researchers were amazed to discover a colossal 100 kilometer ( 62 miles ) stretch of phytoplankton blooming under @entity2 ice , north of @entity14 , in july last year			1
it had previously been assumed that sea ice blocked the sunlight necessary for the growth of marine plants			0
but four times more phytoplankton was found under the ice than in ice - free waters nearby			2
scientists now believe that pools of melting ice actually function like skylights and magnifying glasses , focusing sunlight into sea water , providing the perfect conditions for the intense phytoplankton bloom , which makes the water look like pea soup			1
undiscovered until the 1970s , the ocean 's phytoplankton is now understood to be responsible for about as much of the oxygen in our atmosphere as plants on land			0
the ecological consequences of the polar bloom are not yet fully understood but given phytoplankton 's position at the base of the food chain , it is expected to have implications for ocean animals that feed in the area			0
it was a serendipitous discovery for scientists who , as part of @entity56 's @entity55 program , were studying the impact of climate change in the @entity59 , where melt season changes are pronounced			2
making their way through meter - thick ice aboard the @entity64 's largest icebreaker @entity65 in july last year , scientists observed surprising amounts of fluorescing chlorophyll , indicating the presence of photosynthesizing plant life			2
@entity70 turns towards undersea energy " if someone had asked me before the expedition whether we would see under - ice blooms , i would have told them it was impossible , " said @entity55 mission leader @entity72 of @entity73 , at a press conference announcing the publication of findings in " science " this month			1
" this discovery was a complete surprise			0
" @entity86 , a @entity87 geophysicist who studied the ice 's optical properties , described the under - ice area as looking " like a photographic negative "			1
" beneath the bare - ice areas that reflect a lot of sunlight , it was dark			1
under the melt ponds , it was very bright , " he said			0
the melt pools were found to let in four times as much light as snow - covered ice			0
protected from ultraviolet rays , phytoplankton grows twice as fast under - ice as in the open ocean			1
using an automated microscope system called an @entity107 , @entity109 biologist @entity108 took millions of photographs of the phytoplankton organisms , some of which he also found in brine channels inside the ice			0
@entity117 ice shelves ' tearing apart ' , says study the type of phytoplankton found near coasts can bloom rapidly when there are changes to the amounts of light and nutrients available			0
some blooms are toxic for humans and marine life			0
if the @entity2 sea ice continues to thin , blooms might become more widespread and appear earlier , which could pose problems for migrating birds and whales , said @entity72			1
" it could make it harder and harder for migratory species to time their life cycles to be in the @entity2 when the bloom is at its peak , " he said			1
" if their food supply is coming earlier , they might be missing the boat			0
" " at this point we do n't know whether these rich phytoplankton blooms have been happening in the @entity2 for a long time , and we just have n't observed them before , " he said .			2

a @entity56 expedition has discovered a huge phytoplankton bloom under @entity2 ice
scientists say melting ice pools function as skylights , enabling under - ice photosynthesis
the timing of such blooms could affect migratory species ' feeding cycles
