-- eight more employees from the @entity4 @entity3 are being questioned in connection with a leaked list containing personal information of 1,300 alleged illegal immigrants , @entity1 , a department spokesman , said monday afternoon			1
he said that makes a total of 10 employees questioned , including the two placed on administrative leave last week			2
investigators are interviewing employees who have had access to certain cases " for legitimate business reasons , " he said			2
" we want to give them the opportunity to explain work they 're doing			0
" @entity4 attorney general @entity22 said on @entity0 's " @entity23 " on monday that he expects to launch a formal investigation into the data leak very soon			1
he said he was awaiting the names of at least two suspects from the state 's executive branch			0
@entity1 said the investigators ' goal is to get all the interviews done monday and he believed the suspects ' names would be delivered to the attorney general later in the day			0
by early monday afternoon , the @entity36 ' general counsel had been in touch with the attorney general 's office to bring lawyers there up to speed , @entity1 said			1
earlier @entity22 said , " it 's important we get to the bottom of it immediately			1
we have condemned ... the dissemination , the use , the purpose of the list in the strongest possible terms and we do believe that action needs to be swift			1
" " people have to have confidence in their government that those records will be protected			2
the list was anonymously distributed last week to media and government offices across the state , @entity0 affiliate @entity57 reported			2
an accompanying letter from " @entity63 " insisted that those on the list should be deported immediately			2
@entity4 gov. @entity66 told @entity0 's @entity67 on friday night that the 1,300 people have @entity70 names			1
@entity22 said the alleged crimes may have broken both state and federal privacy laws , and some may have been felonies , so if appropriate , it could be a multi-level investigation			1
he added that crimes may have been committed not only in generating and preparing the list , but also in how the list was used			1
some of the alleged illegal immigrants listed have reported harassment since their names appeared on the list			0
" clearly , it 's not even meant as a blacklist			0
it 's more like a hit list			1
it is , i think , to put people at fear , to terrorize , to get people mobilized to do things			1
the fact is , the names on that list are also innocent until proven guilty and we 're finding that some of those names ... are here legally , " @entity22 said			1
the @entity100 of @entity36 said friday it had identified at least two employees believed to be involved in creating the 29 - page list			1
" at this point we do n't think it was a very large conspiracy			0
we think it was two , maybe			0
we have suspicion of a couple of more people , a very small group , " said @entity106 , the department 's executive director			0
the state focused on the @entity3 , @entity66 's office said thursday , because all of the information on the list -- including contact information , @entity118 numbers and pregnancy due dates -- is contained within that agency 's database			1
those named on the list are even more frightened , @entity125 with the @entity126 of @entity127 said last week			0
" for these 1,300 people , unfortunately , that fear has escalated , " he said			2
" there 's an arrest warrant out , essentially			0
that fear never goes away			0
" @entity66 said friday , " some are scared and apprehensive			2
i expect that comes with the status of being illegal			0
if i was in the country illegally , i would probably have fear and apprehension , too			0
" @entity22 said monday it 's time to put aside rhetoric and work on a solution to the immigration issue			1
@entity66 has plans to bring together what he called a " spectrum " of viewpoints , some " diametrically opposed , " for a round - table discussion on immigration reform in @entity4 on tuesday			1
" we see what 's happened in @entity152 , " he said friday			0
" so @entity4 , like other states right now , are saying if the federal government is not going to do something , we will take steps to do something ourselves within the parameters of the law			2
it may mean creating ( a ) new law			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 contributed to this report			0
