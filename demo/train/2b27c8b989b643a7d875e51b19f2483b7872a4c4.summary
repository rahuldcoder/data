-- controversial remarks by the last white president of @entity5 , @entity4 , in which he validated the origins of " separate but equal " nation states , have been used by critics " unfairly out of context , " his foundation said			1
" the @entity14 regrets that the comments that @entity4 made in his recent interview with @entity17 of @entity0 have been taken so unfairly out of context , " the foundation said in a statement friday			1
" the question that she asked related to the policies that he had supported when he was a young man -- and his reply centered on his view that , though idealistic at the time , they had resulted in the unacceptable injustices of apartheid , " said the foundation , whose founder and chairman is @entity4			1
in the @entity0 interview , @entity4 would not back off his belief in the validity of the original concept of " separate but equal " nation states			1
that remark provoked criticism , including on @entity38 where some @entity5 said @entity4 is n't worthy of the 1993 @entity39 he shared with @entity40 for ending @entity5 's apartheid regime			1
said @entity4 on @entity0 this week : " i do n't apologize for saying that what drove me as a young man , before i decided we need to embrace a new vision , was a quest to bring justice for black @entity5 in a way which would not -- that 's what i believed then -- destroy the justice to which my people were entitled			1
my people , whose self - determination ( was ) taken away by colonial power in the @entity55			0
" that , @entity4 said , is how he was raised			2
" and it was in an era when also in @entity58 and elsewhere , and across the continent of @entity5 , there was still not this realization that we are trampling upon the human rights of people			0
so i 'm a convert			0
" the foundation 's subsequent statement elaborated on @entity4 's position , saying " there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the idea that the problems of territories that include different peoples should be addressed on the basis of territorial partition			1
" this , after all , is what has happened in such societies all over the world -- in the territorial divisions of @entity81 , @entity82 , the @entity83 and more recently in @entity84			0
it is the solution that has long been advocated for @entity88 / @entity87 , " the foundation said			2
@entity5 's apartheid system was born out of " by the loss of the right of @entity93 to self - determination in the @entity55 , " the statement said			0
" however , as @entity98 pointed out , the @entity96 's application of territorial partition was a complete failure because the territorial division was manifestly unfair ( something that @entity98 opposed as a young politician ) , " the statement said			2
" the @entity105 interview dealt with @entity98 's views as a young man			1
he tried , as frankly as he could , to explain what motivated him at the time			0
what motivated him as a young man ceased many years ago to motivate him as a political leader , " the statement said			0
" since the mid-eighties he has accepted that the policies that he supported as a young man were wrong and that there was not any possibility of justly settling @entity5 's complex problems on the basis of territorial partition			0
" @entity0 's @entity123 contributed to this report .			2
