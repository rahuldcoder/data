-- @entity1 is nestled next to the @entity3 site , separated only by a waterway known as the @entity5			2
it is a half industrial , half artistic enclave , little known to @entity7 , but which has , in recent years , become rich in street art from a cast of artists who have been integral to regenerating east @entity12 and informing its cultural identity			1
with the @entity3 now underway , @entity1 can been seen as a microcosm highlighting the forces that street art faces across east @entity12			1
@entity17 meets @entity18 the @entity3 organizing committee , @entity18 , has been asked to deliver a long - remembered games , and multifaceted legacy for @entity12			1
this is no easy task			0
read more : why gritty @entity12 is @entity12 's gold standard unfortunately it has failed , overwhelmingly , to engage with @entity12 's street artists			1
it seems the cultural thinking behind @entity27 is being carried out from within an impenetrable ivory tower , with scant access granted to decision makers			1
in essence , there has been a top - down imposition of what @entity18 thinks is the relevant cultural identity of @entity12 -- and this has been presented to the world			1
to many in east @entity12 , where the @entity40 is located , this imposition feels alien			1
it feels akin to a form of cultural imperialism , out of synch with the true culture , including street art which may be found just a stone 's throw from the @entity49			2
missed opportunities politicians and officials talk about @entity27 using words like " regeneration " and " legacy			0
" such aims are a key reason behind @entity12 winning the @entity58 , and the ideas are laudable			1
read more : @entity12 's docks turn into ' mini @entity61 ' for @entity3 but by not engaging with @entity12 's street artists , @entity18 has arguably missed an opportunity to be more culturally relevant and connect with artists who are a real transformative force			1
from a purely cultural standpoint , this is a shame			0
@entity12 boasts some of the finest street art in the world from fresh and exciting artists such as @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
@entity12 is also a global street art hub , welcoming artists from all over the world			2
people also come from all over to see @entity12 's street art. the diversity and vibrancy of @entity12 's street art is staggering , and celebrating this would have shown vision			2
read more : the artist who turned @entity89 from track legend to street hero perhaps more importantly , @entity18 's spurning of the street art scene counteracts one of east @entity12 's key regenerative forces			1
street art brings energy to the streets and infuses color onto gray and dilapidated walls			0
street art has fostered community spirit and made east @entity104 proud of where they live too			2
this is the very thing alchemists within @entity18 are trying to deliver as part of @entity27 's legacy			0
public art many of @entity12 's street artists view themselves as servants to their local communities , and maintain close connections with them			1
they depend on their communities for patronage and support for wall space			0
as such , @entity12 's street art can be defined as public art for the city 's people			2
around east @entity12 , in particular , the local populace has taken street art to its heart with many locals familiar with each of the different artists at work on the street			1
today 's generation often work in daylight hours doing legal walls			0
they are happy to reveal their identities and also to stop and chat with people passing by in the street while they work			0
it 's sometimes hard for bureaucrats to understand this , so truly ingrained is the media - driven paradigm of all street artists being mischief - makers who put up numerous illegal socio - political stencils in the night			2
@entity12 's local councils are , however , actually starting to understand street art 's evolving nature and its importance to east @entity12 's spirit			1
legal pieces are routinely left alone by councils now , and this has largely been the case in @entity1			0
pieces still get buffed by over zealous clean up crews but reports of a pre-olympics war on street art are a little overplayed			0
the greatest threats to the street art in @entity1 are now arguably from companies like @entity167 painting over local artists with " cool " @entity3 themed murals			1
read more : is the @entity3 worth more than @entity170 ? what legacy ? street art is an important part of east @entity12 's identity and a positive force for regeneration			1
street art has been dismissed and misunderstood by @entity12 bureaucracies in the past , and @entity18 's attitude is no different			2
however we hope it will not always be this way			0
changes in attitude and policy will of course take time and by the time the @entity3 visits @entity12 again perhaps we will be ready			2
we are seeing encouraging green shoots every day			0
@entity0 asked @entity18 to respond to the opinions expressed by @entity188			0
here is their response : the @entity191 has 25,000 artists taking part in more than 12,000 events across the @entity195 in the largest cultural celebration every seen in this country			0
our program in east @entity12 has already seen 100,000 people enjoy artists such as @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and many more as part of the free @entity206 @entity205			1
people are currently a visiting a car park in @entity12 where an exhibition of @entity210 , designed by artists including @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , and @entity215 , is being staged			2
@entity217 and @entity12 carnival artists collaborated for the @entity218 to welcome the @entity219 , screenings of restored @entity222 films at east @entity12 venues and a fantastic program of theater , dance and outdoor events at the @entity228 and with the create festival			1
the @entity191 is a @entity195 wide festival , and we are very excited about the upcoming @entity191 event " @entity232 : @entity233 " in @entity234			0
this is the @entity195 's largest permanent street art project and the biggest urban arts festival in @entity237 , attracting the world 's leading urban artists to converge and create a series of temporary and permanent street art installations and sculpture , including some of the world 's largest scale outdoor paintings			0
for the first time it will bring together two major international artists , @entity249 of @entity249 and @entity251 artist , @entity252 of cutting 3d projection experts @entity254			0
they will create a free , one off cross art - form performance , featuring huge scale digital projections and live music in the centre of @entity234 from 13 -- 19 august 2012			0
