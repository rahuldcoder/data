-- it 's time to do away with vanity plates			1
for the most part , vanity plates have flown under the legal radar , but the time has come for the government to give up on this constitutionally corrupt policy			1
like the lottery , vanity plates are another thinly veiled money grab by the government against its citizens			1
a @entity13 case is putting vanity plates under the spotlight			1
that state 's scheme is similar to many other states ' vanity plate programs			1
on standard plates , the letter and number configuration is computer - generated and random			2
for an additional fee of about $ 30 , @entity13 allows vehicle owners to select their own unique letter and number configuration for their license plates -- with limitations			1
and that 's where the constitutional trouble begins			0
@entity13 's @entity31 contains a " content - based " restriction : it prohibits officials from issuing a personalized license plate " that might carry a connotation offensive to good taste and decency			1
" and there 's the constitutional problem : " offensiveness " and " good taste and decency " are in the eye of the beholder -- the beholder here being whoever is reviewing the application			2
in 2012 , sgt. @entity50 decided to order a personalized license plate that would express his identity as a so - called " infidel " when he served in @entity54			1
" @entity61 " is a term that is commonly used by both enemy forces and our own military in the current theater of war , as explained by @entity50			0
it is not a word banned by the @entity64 or recognized as unprotected speech			0
he began by visiting the vanity plate page on @entity13 's website , and clicked on an @entity69 service plate , which allows six characters for personalized plates			1
because the word " infidel " contains seven letters , @entity50 tried the shorter " @entity75 , " but it was " not available			0
" @entity50 got creative and typed " @entity79 " into the spaces provided , replacing the letter i with a numeral 1			0
it was available , and @entity81 selected it			0
unfortunately , shortly after , a letter from the @entity84 rejected @entity50 's " @entity86 " plate because someone -- a person , not a website program -- determined it might carry a connotation offensive to good taste or decency			1
asking for constitutional trouble the law as written is constitutionally suspect			0
first , it 's vague			0
read the @entity13 prohibition again			1
once you have , ask yourself : " do i now clearly know which words are prohibited and which words are not ? " put another way , if you were asked to come up with a list of offensive words , would " infidel " have been in the top 20 of your list ? top 50 ? if a law does not provide clear instructions on its face so that reasonable citizens can determine what speech is prohibited , then it 's likely unconstitutional as written -- before it 's even applied			1
an additional way a scheme is unconstitutional on its face is when the person making the decisions ( like the official who wrote the rejection letter to @entity50 ) has " unfettered discretion			0
" it seems pretty clear that the website first approved @entity81 's @entity79 , but then a human later vetoed it , with , apparently , unfettered discretion			0
being offended does not an offensive word make as a society , we have fatally mixed up the concept of subjective versus objective when it comes to offensiveness			2
because an individual is offended by a word , that word does not thereby become universally offensive			2
determining whether something is offensive must use an objective standard , which means society on the whole should concur that it is taboo			2
too often when a single individual is offended , we make the illogical jump to conclude that the material offending one is now offensive to all			2
worse , we now deem material offensive not for its actual measured effect , but for its untested potential effect			2
no one was actually offended by @entity50 's plate , likely not even the person who actually rejected it			2
rather , it was banned because the official imagined some potential offensiveness			0
in addition to confusing subjective versus objective in defining " offensive , " we 've placed government officials in the business of foreseeing the future , with an overly cautious eye			1
@entity75 versus @entity86 @entity75 is not a word			1
and if @entity75 is not a word , then @entity86 is definitely not a word			1
it has a number in it ! how offensive could it possibly be ? as spoken , @entity79 actually does n't even sound like " infidel			2
" it 's pronounced " inf - number - one - del. " to interpret it as the offending " infidel " in fact requires a mistake by your brain , and an error in pronunciation			0
either way , the official who rejected @entity50 's @entity79 had to reason that the number 1 is functionally the same as the letter i. they 're not even the same species			0
but fortunately for this government official , no one will ever discipline him for erring on the side of supercareful			0
and just like that , the @entity189 can be violated			0
it 's not really the official 's fault			0
someone gave him too much power			0
that someone is the @entity197			0
if " infidel " is offensive , it 's offensive because of its religious connotation only			2
it 's not one of the seven deadly words you ca n't hear on tv , and it 's not obscene by itself under any test of the @entity208			0
therefore , @entity13 wades headlong into another @entity189 quagmire : entanglement with religion			1
the absurd discussion follows : is @entity213 okay ? how about @entity214 ? if many different people would disagree on whether a word ( or nonword ) is offensive , then the statute has failed to properly instruct its citizens on what is prohibited			1
worse , should our government really be volunteering for this litigation ? should your tax money be spent litigating in federal court whether @entity226 should be stamped on a license plate ? government selling ad space can i pay extra to have my passport custom " bedazzled " with rhinestones , the way people do with their iphones ? of course not			1
sometimes our government has a greater duty than entering the market for a quick buck from its citizens			0
and is the $ 30 that @entity13 extracts from its citizens really worth it ? people have to be hired and extra infrastructure must be created to process those applications			1
then , when they are litigated because citizens ' applications are rejected , how fast do you think attorney fees burn through those state revenues ? @entity254 plates serve no public interest			0
@entity254 plates represent a state selling ad space on its property , disregarding a known constitutional risk , and then losing more money defending the practice			1
citizens already have the constitutional privilege to stencil virtually any word on their cars as it is ( with the usual limitations of the @entity189 ) , without their government trying to make an extra buck on the few square inches that are state property @entity50 should have gotten his plate , but really no one should have them if the @entity13 scheme were constitutional to begin with , @entity50 should have been entitled to his customized plate under any analysis of " offensive " that is reasonable , and not driven by neurosis			1
instead , officials employed an overly risk - averse , pre-emptive analysis			0
since the official has unfettered discretion , he 'll never get in trouble for the plates that never saw the light of day			0
those facts may be fatal to the statute and the vanity plate scheme			1
the real question is whether vanity plates are ultimately worth the constitutional and financial burdens they create			1
and the answer is : @entity294			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity297 .			2

a @entity13 man who served in @entity54 was denied a vanity plate saying " @entity86 "
@entity297 says it ran afoul of @entity13 rule banning " offensive " plates
he says states have no business dictating what words people can put on their plates
@entity297 says vanity plates in general are a *bad* idea -- states selling people ad space
