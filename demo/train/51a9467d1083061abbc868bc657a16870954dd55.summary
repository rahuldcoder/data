-- " what does this thing do ? " that 's what i asked the garbage man one afternoon many years ago when we had @entity8			1
at least i think it was @entity8			1
there were lots of trucks			1
and our teachers encouraged us to look at them and ask questions			1
so , i 'm pretty sure it was n't sex - ed. ( @entity17 , i hope not			1
) anyway , the garbage man smiled and answered my question			1
" well , this makes the mechanical arm go down			2
" me at the helm of a steel hydraulic grabbing device in the vicinity of small children			2
what could possibly go wrong ? i pulled the lever			2
and to this day , it 's pretty much the highlight of my life			2
i should 've been a garbage man			2
instead i became a journalist			2
( i repeat : i should 've been a garbage man			2
) because big trucks are awesome			1
especially when you 're a kid			2
@entity39 knows all about this			1
the 42 - year - old legal recruiter from the suburbs of @entity43 has two boys , 9 and 3			1
and the youngest is completely obsessed with trucks			1
@entity39 explains that his little one is over the moon when it comes to big equipment			1
" like , stop and pull over and watch an active construction site for 10 or 20 minutes kind of excitement			2
" so , he does			2
that 's just being a good dad			2
but one day , back in early july while taking a roadside pause with his son , @entity39 looked out upon the broken land and saw an excavator in a whole new light			1
in this great , massive machine he suddenly saw beauty			2
like @entity63 slathered in baby oil			0
i do n't know what just happened there			0
) as @entity39 looked out over the construction site with this heightened appreciation for machinery , it was then that he decided he would go home and paint the excavator for his son			1
he could already picture it			0
" i 've always been obsessed with @entity76 , " @entity39 says			1
" i had been trying to do paintings that emulated his style for about a year			1
" so , in paying homage to " @entity81 , " he painted " @entity82			0
" and it was magnificent			0
@entity39 posted an image of his painting online and , immediately , people were enthusiastic			1
hundreds asked him if they could buy prints			0
not bad for a former lawyer with largely untapped artistic ability			0
you see , for years , @entity39 was a litigator for a big firm			1
" i was willing to crawl through a sewer pipe like @entity96 did in @entity97 just to get out , " he said			0
i ca n't even imagine			0
or maybe i just do n't want to			0
but he made it out			0
" i have a lot more time for my family , which is why i 'm able to pull over and watch construction equipment when my boys see one in action			0
we also watch trains a lot			0
" ( note : these are real things you can see when you stop clicking through cat videos on your @entity115			0
however , be warned that doing so requires leaving the house and wearing pants			0
) of course , getting out of a busy law career also allowed @entity39 more time to further explore this passion for art , despite the fact that he has no formal training			1
when he was younger he drew a lot , eventually delving into the world of cartoons			0
in college , @entity39 even penned a strip called " @entity128			1
" that one almost got syndicated			0
painting came much later , about 10 years ago			1
which ultimately led to " @entity82			0
" soon after that , @entity39 brushed another truck - inspired masterpiece : " @entity134			1
" once again he had an online hit			1
and it was another fine example of hidden artistic talent being discovered on the @entity138			0
in all , it 's a small body of work -- there are only two truck paintings so far -- but @entity144 's already getting commissions from construction companies , engineers , and manufacturers			0
he says , " one guy told me that he was so happy to see that someone else saw those machines as works of art. " like @entity63 slathered in baby oil			0
