-- the explosive found hidden in a package on a plane in the @entity5 on friday may have traveled on passenger planes to get there , airline officials said sunday			0
the explosive , along with a similar device found in the @entity9 , appear to have been designed to detonate on their own , without someone having to set them off , the top @entity14 counterterrorism official told @entity0			0
" it is my understanding that these devices did not need somebody to detonate them , " said @entity15 , president @entity16 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism			1
@entity27 investigators believe @entity30 bomb maker @entity28 , 28 , is linked to that package and another one found on a second airplane in @entity9 's @entity33 on friday , a federal official , who was briefed by authorities , told @entity34			1
both packages were addressed to synagogues in @entity37 , @entity38			0
@entity39 , who is thought to be in @entity40 , is a @entity41 who was high on @entity41 's list of most wanted published in february 2009			1
he is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year 's failed @entity46 underwear bomb			1
separately , an engineering student arrested in @entity40 was released sunday , along with her mother , according to her father , @entity49			1
she was earlier identified as @entity50 , a fifth - year student at @entity51 in the @entity40 capital , said @entity53 , a human rights attorney and activist who said he was asked to represent her			1
a high - level source in the @entity5 said @entity50 's name was found on the cargo manifest of the device found in @entity60			0
also arrested was her mother , @entity61			0
@entity53 had said the mother 's arrest was illegal and said holding the two in an undisclosed location was " a criminal act			2
" authorities do not have any @entity27 suspects at this time , a @entity27 official said			0
two schools in @entity40 were being looked at in connection with the plot and had been on the radar of @entity27 officials before , the official said			1
the explosive device found in @entity60 , @entity5 , was contained in a @entity79 printer , and had a motherboard originating from a mobile phone , but did not have a sim card in it , the high - level source told @entity0			0
the device was professionally assembled , the source said			0
the motherboard was connected by a striker to the printer head and then to the cartridge , which was filled with explosives			0
authorities have the serial number of the motherboard and the printer , and are searching to see where it was sold , how it was paid for and what information they can glean about the people who performed those transactions , according to the source			0
authorities believe an explosive device found at the @entity9 's @entity33 airport flew from @entity40 to a @entity103 state , then to @entity104 , @entity105 , the official said			1
the device was then transferred onto a @entity108 plane			0
investigators are still attempting to retrace the route of the @entity60 device , according to the high - level official			2
some believe it went to @entity115 , @entity116 , on @entity117 , where it spent the night before traveling to @entity60 the following day			0
however , it does appear the devices did fly on commercial passenger planes , the high - level official said			2
screening the devices would have been difficult , since printers normally contain computer parts and wires , according to @entity127 , @entity0 's aviation correspondent			2
@entity117 , which said earlier sunday that it had flown the device from @entity40 to @entity60 for @entity130 , is no longer certain that is true , a senior airline source said			2
the airline is investigating the possibility that the explosives flew on another airline after finding inconsistencies in information it was given , the source said			0
an airline spokesman said earlier that two @entity117 passenger planes had carried the package			0
@entity142 , which also flies from @entity40 to the @entity5 , said as far as it is aware , it had not carried the package			2
the package was being sent by @entity130 , which uses other airlines to get parcels out of @entity40 because it does not fly there itself			2
the two devices found friday look like they were put together by the same bomber who designed last year 's failed @entity46 underwear bomb , a @entity27 government official told @entity0			1
" the thinking is it 's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb , because of the way it 's put together , " said the official , who had been briefed by multiple @entity27 authorities and law enforcement sources			1
" but this one is about four times as powerful			0
" @entity27 authorities are now endorsing @entity9 prime minister @entity165 's position that the explosives were designed to take down an airplane , the official said			2
however , a @entity27 official said sunday the @entity27 has not drawn any conclusions on the intent of the bombs and whether they were intended to explode in flight , at the synagogues or somewhere else			0
@entity27 and @entity9 authorities think @entity30 's branch in @entity40 is linked to the plot			1
a key figure in the group is the @entity27 - born @entity40 militant cleric @entity178 , whom @entity27 authorities have linked to @entity180 shooting suspect maj. @entity181 and the man accused in the @entity46 bomb attempt			1
@entity15 on friday declined to name @entity178 specifically as a suspect			0
" anybody who 's associated with @entity186 is a subject of concern , " he said			0
@entity40 is investigating the shipping agency that sent the packages , its president @entity189 said saturday , based on information provided by the @entity27 and @entity9 , who in turn are getting tips from @entity41			1
the @entity9 is sending a security team to help with @entity40 's investigation , @entity189 said			1
a specific explosive was found in both friday 's devices and in the foiled underwear bomb attempt in 2009 , a source close to the investigation said			1
it 's a highly explosive organic compound called @entity205 , which belongs to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin , the source said			0
six grams of @entity205 are enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft			0
@entity205 was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by @entity214 , the @entity215 man accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard a @entity219 flight as it approached @entity220 , @entity221 , on december 25			2
" the quantity of @entity205 in these [ new ] devices was about five times the volume used at @entity46 " by @entity214 , col. @entity226 , the former chairman of the @entity9 government 's @entity227 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity222			2
@entity40 's president said his country is cooperating with the @entity27 , the @entity9 , and @entity41			1
the @entity27 @entity233 is sending six inspectors to @entity40 to help improve cargo security , an official with the agency said sunday			1
" even before this incident , 100 percent of identified high - risk cargo on inbound passenger planes was being screened , " @entity233 administrator @entity236 said in a statement sunday , noting that security procedures will evolve based on the latest intelligence information			1
over the past several months , @entity40 , which wants to be seen as a committed partner in the fight against terrorism , has launched several offensives against @entity30 in its country , but has not captured @entity178			1
" we acknowledge that we have a problem with terrorism , specifically the presence of @entity30 , and we continue to pay a high price , " @entity189 said			2
the @entity40 government imposed new security measures at local airports , the @entity254 news agency said sunday , including " unusual check methods on outgoing packages from @entity40 airports			1
" meanwhile , @entity27 authorities were grateful for a tip from @entity40 's oil - rich neighbor , @entity41 , alerting them to the suspicious packages			1
@entity41 officials provided tracking numbers of the two packages , enabling quick tracing to the @entity9 and @entity60 , a source told @entity0			0
@entity0 's @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0
