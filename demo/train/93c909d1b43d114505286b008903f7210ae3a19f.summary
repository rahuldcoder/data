@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 is investigating how an international flight into @entity0 's major airport landed on a taxiway instead of a runway early monday			1
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity8 said @entity9 60 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity0 's @entity12 , was cleared to land about 6:05 a.m. monday on @entity13 but landed instead on @entity14 , which runs parallel to the runway			1
the flight had 194 passengers and crew aboard , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity17			0
no other aircraft were on the taxiway , and there was no damage to either the taxiway or the plane , a @entity18 767 , @entity8 said			1
a runway or taxiway collision , particularly with one plane preparing to take off and carrying a full fuel load , would be catastrophic			1
@entity8 said she is n't sure whether or when other aircraft have ever landed on the taxiway at @entity12			1
both @entity31 and @entity14 are 11,890 feet long , @entity8 said , but the runway is marked with white lights while the taxiway is marked with blue lights			2
@entity9 spokesman @entity35 said the airline is cooperating with the @entity3 and the @entity37 in their investigation , as well as conducting an internal investigation			2
the pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations , @entity35 said			0
@entity8 and @entity35 said a medical emergency was reported on the plane , but neither offered any details			0
the incursion came just two weeks after the @entity3 announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent from the year that ended september 30 , 2008 , over the year ending on the same date this year			2
the @entity3 said there were 12 serious incursions in 2009 and 25 in 2008			0
only two of the serious incursions involved commercial airliners in 2009 , compared with nine in 2008			0
the @entity3 defines a serious incursion as one in which a collision is narrowly avoided , or there was a significant potential for collision that resulted in the need to take quick corrective action .			0
