@entity0 -- when the race is done , the balloons have wilted , and the confetti has been swept up , campaign 2012 may be marked more by its failures than its triumphs			2
but here 's the starkest failure in these final days before the vote : neither candidate has made a convincing enough argument for his presidency to break free of the margin of error in the polls			2
no matter who is elected , close to as many @entity18 will have voted against him as for him			2
sure , @entity19 has generally stayed a point or two ahead of his rival in most battlegrounds , but despite his mighty pushes and the advantage of the bully pulpit he has rarely done any better			1
and @entity26 , while he has managed to relentlessly nip at the president 's heels like a dog chasing a car ( as opposed to one riding on top ) , he has never been able to decisively bridge the gap from " also ran " to " front runner			1
" mad dash in final bid for votes the most recent @entity38 -- an average of 10 national polls -- has @entity19 just one point ahead of @entity26 , 48 % -47 %			1
the latest @entity1 / @entity43 survey in the battleground state of @entity45 has @entity19 up 50 % -47 % , and in @entity46 by just one point , 50 % -49 %			1
both results are well within the polls ' margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 %			2
and if both parties are not haunted by the ever - growing mob of voters calling themselves independents , they ought to be			2
at least dr. @entity58 at @entity59 thinks so			2
she is director of the @entity60			2
" @entity61 is n't a party , " she says			2
" it just means ' none of the above			2
' people are not really satisfied with either party			0
" @entity26 's difficulties in breaking through the margin of error have been well documented : a slow start that allowed the @entity71 to paint his strongest positive , his business experience , as a negative ; a clumsy trip overseas ; and more than one stumble that helped build the caricature of an out - of - touch fat cat			1
note to future campaigners : working class folks have a little trouble relating to a guy who proposes $ 10,000 bets			0
being pulled from the right but perhaps a deeper part of @entity26 's trouble dates back to @entity19 's single biggest humiliation since taking office			1
two years ago this month , @entity87 ripped control of the @entity89 from the @entity90 , seized new ground in the @entity92 , and captured 10 extra governorships in what appeared to be a resounding rejection of the @entity71 agenda			0
a subdued @entity19 called it a " shellacking , " admitting in a masterpiece of understatement , " some election nights are more fun than others			1
" if @entity26 wins ... @entity26 : my vision for @entity105 the @entity87 charge up @entity107 , however , was not led by party purists			1
the flags of the tea party waved high over the @entity90 trouncing , and created a whole new road for @entity87 presidential hopefuls such as @entity26			1
the uncompromising tea partiers made it clear they would get behind only someone who paid the toll of a hard and unmistakable turn to the right , especially on fiscal matters			0
and as @entity125 puts it , " a candidate ( who makes that turn ) stands very little chance of getting back to the center in time for the general election			0
" was he ever ' severely conservative ' enough ? @entity26 was always an awkward fit			1
he had a hard time embracing the far right with enthusiasm , and the right felt the same about him			0
that is one reason why the nomination process dragged on so long , as the faithful tried to make it work with @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			0
but @entity26 was not just wrestling with philosophical differences			1
" something else that pulls candidates away from the middle is money , " says assistant professor @entity140 at @entity142 's @entity141 , where she is a fellow in @entity143			0
she notes that @entity26 's now infamous " 47 percent " comment was almost certainly spurred by the need to appeal to right - wing donors at that fundraiser			1
" he did n't have to say it , " @entity140 says , " but it certainly made ( his message ) more powerful			0
" the same might be said about candidate @entity19 's similar stumble four years ago when he privately told donors that rural voters " cling to their guns or religion			1
" @entity140 believes the @entity87 nominee , all things considered , has walked the tightrope well			0
" i actually think @entity26 did a great job using the first debate to position himself back in the middle			1
" it all came at a price			0
his vacillation between the right and center has allowed @entity173 to pelt him with accusations of flip - flopping and a schizophrenic candidacy , leaving @entity26 unable to crawl out of the margin - of - error trench			1
@entity178 : it 's the losing campaigns i remember most a president marginalized @entity19 did not have to tack nearly as far left as he would have if he were fighting other @entity90 for the nomination this year , and undeniably he had some accomplishments to carry into the election			1
health care reform was upheld by the @entity187			0
the war in @entity189 was concluded and @entity190 is winding down			0
as vice president @entity193 loves to say , because of @entity19 , " @entity191 is dead , and @entity192 is alive			1
" despite all that , the president , too , has spent the campaign in a marginal spot , right alongside @entity26			1
his enemy is the economy , or as @entity140 puts it , " unemployment has n't gone down ; " at least not down to the 5 % range @entity19 himself promised early in his term when he was touting the stimulus			1
most voters have been willing to blame the legacy of the @entity206 years , and the president has encouraged that thinking at every juncture , reminding anyone who will listen that he inherited the worst recession since the @entity211			2
an unwilling participant in his own reelection but his reelection team clearly knew " it could be worse " was not much of a campaign slogan , so over the summer they steadily shifted to a divide - and - conquer strategy			1
gone is " @entity19 " -- the apparently easygoing man who went into the @entity71 promising to bring warring political parties to the table of peace and prosperity			1
in his place is a much tougher talking candidate who misses no chance to savage the @entity87 , to ridicule @entity26 as a " bull * * * * er , " and like his opponent , to bend the truth until it breaks			1
" they 're ignoring the fact checkers , " @entity125 says of both @entity19 and @entity26			1
if @entity19 wins ... @entity19 : my vision for @entity105 the president , clearly much happier preaching @entity236 in 2008 , has seemed at times an unwilling participant in his own reelection			1
at the @entity240 , critics widely saw @entity242 's speech as superior , @entity193 's as more passionate , and the president 's as acceptable at best			0
the first debate with @entity26 brought even more concern for @entity90			1
president @entity19 sat looking down much of the time and seemed alternately angry , bored , or disengaged			1
his showing was so lackluster even faithful fans wondered whether he really wanted the @entity71 anymore			0
perhaps that is why he too , aside from one brief surge in august , has been unable to establish a commanding lead			2
despite his consistently strong personal popularity , he 's had to cling for his political life to every vote he can scrape up within the margin of error			0
opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 more money , less unity neither candidate can say his deadlocked fate in the polls is because people have not heard his message			0
no other election has ever seen so much money raised and spent to win the @entity71 -- latest estimates have the 2012 campaign costing , all in , as much as $ 6 billion			2
all those ads , all those tv interviews with the candidates and their surrogates , all the debates and bus trips			0
they 've each had their chances to break out over and over again			2
yet neither has been able to get the job done			0
they may have , however , accomplished another task			0
although they each gave lip service to the idea of us all being in this together , the divisiveness of the race itself seems to have hardened opinions even more in red and blue @entity105			0
in the end , it remains to be seen if there will be a president of the @entity18			0
with trust at a low , paranoia grows sure , someone will win the office , but arguably both campaigns have done all they can to make sure the country will be anything but united			0
if @entity19 wins , the stalwarts of @entity105 may hunker down in their " bitterness , " simply enduring the next four years while awaiting the next chance to storm the castle			1
if @entity26 wins , the faithful of blue @entity105 may feed on their fury and do to the other party 's president exactly what they accuse @entity87 of doing to theirs ; obstructing his every plan			1
@entity140 likes to think not			0
she believes the very political partisans who 've helped lead the country to this point may lead it back to more conciliatory days , if only for cynical reasons			0
" the economy is going to turn around , " she says , " and they 're all going to want to claim some responsibility			0
" @entity125 , however , believes those better days may be a longer time coming			0
" i think leadership will emerge			0
i just do n't think it has yet			0
" maybe , she suggests , the candidates once had ideas of a great , unifying moment -- of a nation coming together to confront its common issues in this campaign , but along the way those dreams were lost in the margins .			2

*analysis* : both @entity26 and @entity19 have been unable to break through to unite voters
@entity26 has been trying to *recover* from being pulled from the right early in the campaign
@entity19 has seemed like an unwilling participant in his own *re-election*
