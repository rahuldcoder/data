elections in @entity1 always generate much excitement domestically and internationally			2
however , they hardly produce conclusive results of a clear winner in terms of policies and leadership			0
no single party has won an absolute majority since the country was founded more than 64 years ago			0
tuesday 's election leaves @entity1 politically more divided than ever : the ruling party @entity13 and its leaders @entity15 and @entity16 are injured and badly bruised , but not knocked out			1
the party lost around a quarter of their combined seats in the @entity1 @entity19			2
nevertheless , in the mysterious ways that @entity1 politics operate , @entity15 is still best positioned to form the next government , but just barely and without absolute certainty			1
the results will lead to weeks , if not months , of the customary horse - trading process of building a coalition that brings together into government politicians who have at times little in common , let alone a coherent agenda			0
@entity1 's elections confound critics @entity15 's triumphant speech to his supporters on tuesday night , following the declaration of the exit polls , could n't conceal the fact that his party 's showing in the elections was disappointing , and that the task of forming a stable coalition remains thorny			1
the center - left bloc did better than predicted			1
the biggest surprise of the elections was the newly - formed @entity44 ( there is a @entity46 ) , led by @entity47 , which gained 19 seats , and the @entity50 which also managed to increase its number of seats slightly to 15			0
following the counting of nearly all the ballots it became clear that @entity15 's gamble on a joint list with former foreign minister @entity16 did n't pay off			1
the joint list lost to the resurgent , more right - wing , party @entity58 , led by @entity59 , and some votes even migrated to the center - left , which defied public opinion polls to become almost equal in size to the right - bloc			1
the election campaigning is over , the billboards on the streets are removed , and the election jingles are silenced			0
but challenges remain for the new government			0
internationally , the @entity73 has changed dramatically , as result of the @entity75 , posing great strategic challenges			0
in @entity1 , @entity15 's party wins but centrists flex muscle @entity80 continues its pursuit of nuclear capability and resolving the conflict with the @entity84 seems to be as remote as ever			1
domestically , disagreement with the ultra orthodox about serving in the army remains a contentious issue dividing the @entity1 society , as does the genuine integration of the @entity92 minority into @entity1 society , let alone the recent economic downturn , and the ever - growing gaps between rich and poor			2
and this is only a few of the challenges ahead			0
even if @entity15 seems to be the one with the most realistic chance to form a coalition , tuesday 's results show this is no foregone conclusion			2
even as the ballots were being counted , the parties started informally negotiating the composition of the next government			0
the next few days and weeks will reveal @entity15 's preferred partners			2
will he opt for a distinctive right - wing coalition with which he might feel more ideologically comfortable , but will put him on a course of collision with many of @entity1 's friends around the world ? if such a government decides to expand the building of @entity118 settlements and procrastinate -- if not block completely -- any progress on the peace process , it will potentially lead to the isolation of @entity1 in the international community and to growing tensions with @entity1 's main ally , the @entity125			1
president @entity126 , who has already questioned the wisdom of @entity129 's policies and how well they serve the @entity1 national interest , might take a more assertive approach to @entity1 policies which he believes also hinder @entity125 national interest in the region			2
free from the need to be re-elected and considering @entity15 's support of his opponent in the @entity125 presidential elections , @entity126 might confront the expected @entity1 prime minister 's policies more proactively			1
another option open to @entity15 is to offer either @entity44 or the @entity50 to join him -- though that would risk a rift with his traditional ultra-orthodox supporters or even parts of his own party			0
alternatively , he might opt to lure parties from both sides of the political map , but this might prove to be way too complex to form , and extremely divisive to preside over , for the duration of the @entity19			0
it will be interesting to observe how the strengthened center - left bloc is going to approach coalition negotiations			1
opinion : time for @entity125 to stop shielding @entity1 do they believe they can form a government themselves ? are they going to operate as a united bloc that will set clear red lines in order to join a @entity15 government -- whether on the issue of progress in the peace process or socio - economic issues ? or will they will jockey for a position and outbid one another for a place around the @entity175 table ? working as a bloc and adhering to their pre-election promises might either guarantee them a stronger bargaining position in the negotiations to form a government or public credibility , which will pay off in the next elections			1
@entity1 politicians are not known for such long - term calculations and the temptation of government might prove too big			0
over coming weeks , speculation will mount about the nature of the next government , while the process of coalition building will occupy the @entity1 political system and its public			0
whatever the outcome of forming a government , the fragmented results of the election might produce a government incapable of giving the answers to the most pressing challenges @entity1 faces , and in the end might not even remain in power for too long , before a call for fresh elections .			1

election result leaves @entity1 more divided than ever
@entity15 can look left or right for coalition partners
his group lost votes to more right - wing parties and a center - left bloc
whoever rules , it is not clear they *'ll* be able to provide answers to @entity1 's pressing *problems*
