-- it all comes down to this : 11 years later , the front door was unlocked			2
when @entity5 jumped the @entity7 fence late last month , he should have been just another statistic			1
a mentally ill man who was doing what a handful of others do every year , get onto the @entity7 lawn and find themselves tackled by guards or brought down by dogs or fired upon by snipers			1
but this time it was different			0
the president and first family were n't home , the snipers did n't shoot			2
it 's still not clear where the dogs were or why there was no @entity27 officer at the @entity29 door			1
but the door was unlocked and the reason why can be traced directly back to the beginning of the disintegration of protocols for what the @entity35 once did better than any other agency in the world : protect the principal			1
toward the end of the 1990s , there was turmoil in senior management , which saw new @entity35 directors come and go			1
there were also high - level retirements -- especially @entity48 agents who had lived through march 30 , 1981 , the assassination attempt on president @entity50			1
these were men and women who knew what it was to fail			0
in the wake of that incident , the @entity35 had upped the ante with new plans and a revised agenda , which had included working in closer proximity to the president , increasing the intensity in the levels of protection and paying closer attention to the minutest details			1
they had also learned to deal better with the presidential staff , who are always looking to break the president loose from his shackles for the sake of the next great photo opportunity			2
it worked for a while			0
but shortly after 9/11 -- 11 years ago , in 2003 -- @entity74 made the colossal mistake of uprooting the @entity35 from its rightful home in the @entity78 , where it had been since 1865 , throwing a proud tradition out the window and dropping it into the hodgepodge mess that was , and still is , the @entity84			1
it was like yanking a great old oak tree up from the roots and shoving it into the ground somewhere else			0
the great oak slowly began to wither			0
what was once a quasi-independent agency was treated like just another bureaucracy that had to defend its turf and fight for every nickel against the rest of this new and increasingly dysfunctional family			0
@entity97 suffered and so did efficiency			0
you saw it in 2003 , when the @entity102 staff cooked up the highly dangerous and totally unnecessary publicity stunt of landing the president on an aircraft carrier in a fixed - wing plane			2
that scheme ran head - first into everything the @entity35 used to stand for			1
the president and the staff were doing this their way			0
the @entity35 is charged by @entity113 with protecting the life of the president ; it is not his choice whether or how he is protected			1
you saw it again in december 2008 at the @entity74 press conference in @entity120 , when an @entity122 journalist threw his shoe at the president			1
the journalist threw his other shoe			0
and no agents appear anywhere near the president			0
in fact , the agent who suddenly showed up next to him does not grab the president and pull him away , he watches other men tackle the journalist			0
by the time president @entity136 came along , the lack of proximity and intensity was startling			1
this goes beyond the phony signer at @entity140 's funeral , agents with hookers at @entity143 or drunk agents at a hotel in @entity146			0
this is a couple of reality show wannabes getting into the @entity7 for a formal reception , without an invitation			2
this is the president at the @entity153 " remembrance in 2013 , standing alone and exposed in the middle of the @entity155 , in front of tens of thousands of people , and there is n't an agent within 30 feet of him			2
this is the president working rope lines , with plenty of agents present , but none of them in very tight proximity , holding onto him , the way they did with @entity50			1
nor are the agents intensely working the crowd -- " may i see your hands , please ... hands ... please show me your hands ... " the way they did with @entity50			2
this is the president speaking from a stage with 100 people behind him , and no agents right there to grab him if something happens , with no clear exit to get him out of there if something happens , because all those people behind him will panic and run for the same exit			0
this is a man jumping the @entity7 fence with a knife , and bullets in his car , after having been on the @entity35 's list of people already interviewed as a possible threat to the president			1
it 's a man with a gun riding in an elevator with the president at the @entity205			1
this is some crazy taking shots at the @entity7 , and no one reporting it for days			2
@entity35 director resigns the @entity35 agents who protect this president are the best and brightest			1
they make unbelievable personal sacrifices to keep the president safe			0
and like him , they too have been let down			0
they 've been let down by senior management			0
and they 've been let down by time , because without a tradition of passing stories on to the next generation , memories fade and " the way it used to be " is eventually forgotten			0
it 's time to return the @entity35 to @entity78 , where it traditionally has belonged , because at @entity78 , there was real oversight			1
it 's also time to bring into the senior ranks men and women who understand that proximity and intensity and attention to the minutest details truly matters			0
these must be men and women who understand and appreciate that those who served before them protecting @entity50 set the gold standard , that the gold standard is an absolute minimum , and anything less -- like an unlocked door at the @entity7 -- can all too quickly look like november 22 , 1963			1
opinion : do we want a fortress @entity7 ?			2

@entity246 : man who got into @entity7 example of a @entity35 in *decline*
he says @entity50 - era protocols that valued close , intense protection for president failing
he says @entity74 's post- 9/11 shift of agency from @entity78 to @entity258 opened door to *laxity*
@entity246 : @entity136 repeatedly exposed to danger . put agency back under @entity78 's oversight
