-- this weekend , a @entity2 - directed drama starring @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6 got trounced at the box office by @entity8 in an old - man costume			2
yep , " @entity10 : bad @entity18 " topped the chart with an excellent $ 32 million in its first three days , giving @entity8 his sixth no. 1 movie after his three " @entity10 " films , " @entity16 , " and " @entity17			1
" not a bad run for a guy who built his career on getting pushed into street curbs while sitting inside shopping carts ! " @entity30 , " which @entity31 made on a $ 15 million budget , did n't feature the entire " @entity10 " crew , but it still posted numbers in line with the rest of the irreverent prank franchise			1
@entity34 's ' @entity33 ' has worst debut of 2013 while the film opened below 2010â € ²s " @entity38 , " which debuted with $ 50 million ( boosted , in part , by @entity41 ticket prices ) , it beat the openings of both " jackass : @entity44 " ( $ 22.8 million ) and " jackass : @entity46 " ( $ 29 million )			1
audiences gave it a middling " b " @entity50 grade , but if it performs similarly to its " @entity10 " predecessors , " @entity30 " should finish with about $ 70 - 80 million total			1
" @entity30 " finally knocked " gravity " out of first place , but @entity56 ' $ 100 million space drama starring @entity57 and @entity58 still managed a terrific hold in its fourth weekend			1
the film dropped just 32 percent to $ 20.3 million , giving it a $ 200.5 million total and making it @entity58 's highest - grossing film ever ahead of " @entity64 , " which earned $ 183.4 million in 2001			1
one rung below , @entity66 ' nautical drama " @entity67 " stayed on course in its third voyage			0
@entity72 's $ 55 million film sank just 28 percent to $ 11.8 million and $ 70.1 million total			1
after a trio of misfires in " @entity77 , " " @entity78 " and " @entity79 , " " @entity67 " marks a major return - to - form for @entity66			0
with some likely awards attention in the weeks to come , the film could sail to the $ 100 million mark			2
casting net : @entity84 to direct and star in @entity86 - set thriller down in fourth place , @entity2 's star - studded drama " @entity88 " failed out of the gate with just $ 8 million from 3,044 theaters			1
@entity92 spent $ 25 million on the film , but audiences were n't impressed by its convoluted ad campaign â € ” and they were n't impressed by the final product either , slapping " the counselor " with a distressing " d " cinemascore grade			2
while " gravity " and " @entity67 " have thrived in recent weeks , adult dramas like " @entity101 , " " @entity102 , " " @entity33 " and now " @entity88 " have fallen by the wayside			0
after a disappointing debut , horror remake " @entity110 " plummeted by 63 percent in its second weekend to $ 5.9 million , giving @entity106 ' and @entity109 's $ 30 million film an awful $ 26 million total			2
so much for @entity113 appeal easing its decline during the sophomore frame			0
that opened the door for " @entity118 " to score one final weekend in the top five , grossing $ 6.1 million and pushing its total past $ 100 million			0
" jackass presents : @entity30 " -- $ 32 million 2			1
" gravity " -- $ 20.3 million 3			2
" @entity67 " -- $ 11.8 million 4			0
" the counselor " -- $ 8 million 5			0
" @entity118 " -- $ 6.1 million oscar contender " @entity124 " jumped into the top 10 after expanding from 19 to 123 theaters			0
the harrowing slavery drama , which earned an " a " @entity50 from audiences last weekend , grossed $ 2.2 million , yielding a $ 17,480 location average this weekend and an excellent $ 3.4 million total after 10 days			1
@entity130 will continue to expand the film ( which was produced by @entity6 's production company , @entity133 â € ” so it was n't all bad news for the star this weekend ) in the weeks to come			0
