-- forget " @entity1 " and " @entity2			1
" in a few months , " @entity4 " phenomenon will be taking over the pop culture world			1
although it will be feeding off the tween demographic , this franchise will chew up those other guys and spit them out			1
but what exactly is this " @entity13 " wonder that has so many folks talking months before the movie ( which just wrapped up filming earlier this month ) is even released ? like many of the wildly successful film franchises these days , it began with a book			2
@entity18 is the mastermind behind " @entity4 " trilogy , which has been gaining momentum over the last few months for both its suspenseful plot and overarching message about society			1
the plot revolves around a dystopian society where punishment for a previous rebellion has resulted in a televised event			1
one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district ( there are 12 total ) are selected at random and forced to participate in the @entity13 , where " tributes " must fight to the death until only one is left standing			1
" @entity4 " gives us a heroine named @entity41 , a strong - willed and unwavering spirit , who volunteers for the games in order to spare her younger sister			1
once inside the death match arena , she must get down and dirty to outlive her competitors , but there 's one slight problem			1
her hot friend @entity50 gets cast into the games , too			2
in the midst of all the slaying , @entity41 finds herself embroiled in a love triangle with her longtime pal @entity54 , who is watching the games from his home , and @entity50 , who confesses his love for her inside the arena			2
@entity41 ' emotional turmoil of love or death makes @entity63 's " @entity65 " look like child 's play			1
apparently , @entity67 ' twisted plot came to her one night while she was channel surfing between a competition reality show and a news program about the @entity72 war			1
she blended the two shows and " @entity4 " was born			1
the first film of the franchise is slated for release on march 23 , 2012 , while the second film is already booked for november 2013			2
fans can only hope director @entity79 does n't soften the book , because the twists and turns will make for an edge - of - your - seat thriller			2
at this rate , the film is set to have more passion than " @entity2 " and more action than " @entity1			0
" the film has already faced some controversy			0
when @entity90 announced that @entity91 had been cast to play @entity41 , both fans and critics questioned the choice , believing she was too old , too blond and too pretty to play a ruthless warrior			0
however , if her success in " @entity98 " and " x-men : @entity103 " is any indication of her range , @entity100 has the potential to nail this role and pave the way for kick - butt female heroines			0
the movie 's lead male stars will likely rise to instant fame , just as @entity111 and @entity112 did with " @entity2			0
" the relatively unknown actors @entity114 ( @entity50 ) and @entity115 ( @entity54 ) will provide plenty of eye candy for the film			0
other stars on the bill include @entity121 ( @entity122 ) , @entity123 ( @entity124 ) and @entity125 ( @entity126 )			0
the film was originally meant to be low budget , however the hype has pushed the movie to a nearly $ 100 - million production , the @entity127 reported			0
the cast and crew wrapped filming earlier this month after an 84 - day shoot , and a recently released teaser trailer has given fans a taste of what 's to come			0
the hype may have escalated the budget , but the film may still exceed all expectations -- and be one lucrative franchise that reaches audiences of all ages			0
now , with only a few months until the first film 's release , you still have plenty of time to pick up the book if you have n't read it			0
but be warned , once you finish the addictive read , you 'll probably hunger for more .			0
