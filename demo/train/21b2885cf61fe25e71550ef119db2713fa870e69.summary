-- after a @entity1 landed at a small airport in @entity3 a couple of months ago -- the pilot having mistaken the runway for a much longer and wider one in a similar orientation at a nearby military base -- i made the prediction that it was n't the last time we 'd see such a blunder			1
i just did n't think it would happen again so soon			0
but on sunday , a @entity15 737 crew mistook a runway at a small local airport in @entity18 , @entity19 , for the much larger runway at nearby , @entity21 , and landed at the small strip by mistake			1
to make matters more hair - raising , the 737 touched down on a relatively short runway even for light planes , never mind for airliners			0
to their credit , the crew members of the @entity30 jet got it stopped short of the end of the runway , where an embankment separated it from @entity37 , without doing any damage to passengers or the plane			1
the question arises : " how did a professionally trained crew manage to screw up so badly ? " the answer is it 's very easy to do			2
take the accidental landing of a @entity45 at a small @entity47 airport in 2012 , for example			0
the crew 's intended airport was @entity51 , but it instead touched down the giant jet on the much , much shorter , 100 - foot - wide runway a few miles away			1
military personnel had to work for hours after the mix - up to lighten the airplane 's load so it could take off from the short strip			0
the fact is that any pilot with a lot of experience who claims to have never at least lined up to land at a runway other than the intended one is probably fibbing			0
i 've been flying everything from light propeller planes to big jets for more than 30 years , and i 've aimed for the wrong runway three times and a really big taxiway on a different occasion			1
the problem is there are two distinct modes of operating an airplane , by reference to the instruments and by visual reference			0
with very , very few exceptions , every flight ends with the pilot turning off the autopilot ( if it was engaged ) , taking physical command of the plane through the flight and power controls , " acquiring " the runway visually and landing			2
sometimes that process happens in the last 10 seconds of a flight , sometimes in the last five minutes			0
it 's that visual acquisition of the landing runway that 's the trap			2
when pilots see what they believe is the right runway , they 're going to land there unless some big alarm goes off in their head			2
it 's simply human nature , and pilots are humans			2
they proceed to disregard the instruments and simply " hand fly " the airplane to a landing , that is if the co-pilot does n't alert them to the flub			2
all the while the navigation instruments " know " the plane is headed to the wrong airport , but the pilots do n't pay attention because in their mind they 've already found the right runway , so why even bother to look at the instruments ? why do n't more of these wrong airport episodes end in disaster ? it 's luck that most of them do n't			1
tragically , there are exceptions			0
in 2006 , a regional jet took off from the wrong runway in @entity126 , @entity127			1
the runway was too short and the jet crashed , killing 49 people in the process			0
landing at the wrong airport or choosing the wrong runway can be catastrophic			1
had the 747 in @entity3 tried landing on a runway as short as the one the much smaller 737 touched down on over the weekend , i do n't think it could have stopped in time to avoid going off the end and at the very least wrecking the airplane			1
modern airliners have two things going for them â € ” great brakes and powerful reverse thrusters â € ” and in the case of both the 737 and the 747 before it , it was a good thing they did			1
i was n't there to witness either event , but i 'd be shocked if the smell of superheated brake pads was n't in the air			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			0

@entity153 : 2 months after a jet landed on wrong runway , it happened again in @entity19
how does crew get it wrong ? if you 've been flying a long time , it 's happened to you , he says
he says pilots turn off autopilot just before landing , do n't always see it 's wrong field
@entity153 : it can be *deadly* . a *saving* grace of newer jets : great brakes , reverse thrusters
