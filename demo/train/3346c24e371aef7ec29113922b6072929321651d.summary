-- despite being a sport well into its seventh decade , only two women have ever driven in @entity5 but @entity6 is hoping she may just become the third			1
on monday , it was announced that the @entity10 driver will become the first woman to take part in a @entity5 event of any kind in 22 years			1
already a development driver with @entity18 team @entity16 , the 31 - year - old is scheduled to take part in the first practice sessions ahead of the @entity18 and @entity22 grands prix in july			1
the last woman to drive an @entity5 car during a race weekend was @entity28 's @entity27 , who failed to qualify at @entity29 in @entity30 while driving for @entity31 in 1992			2
however , you have to go back to 1976 to find the last grand prix featuring a female driver when @entity35 finished an @entity5 career that had started two years earlier			1
prior to that , another @entity28 -- @entity38 -- raced for @entity39 three times in 1958			0
now @entity6 has been given the chance to follow in their footsteps , even if such a prospect may take some time			0
' i 'm grateful for the support and belief @entity16 continue to show in me and 2014 promises to be a very important milestone in my career , " @entity6 told the manufacturer 's website			2
" my responsibilities within the team have steadily increased as i have proved myself , culminating in the opportunity to test the car at @entity57 and conduct straight line aero tests last season			0
" competing in two ( practice ) sessions , alongside an additional full test day this season will be a big step and i am looking forward to the opportunity to get behind the wheel on a grand prix weekend			2
" it 's a challenge that i will relish and it will be a great chance for me to continue assisting the team			0
'' in a separate interview , @entity6 stated that the possibility of taking part in practice sessions on a friday meant she had to be eyeing up a chance at driving on the sunday			1
" if you can take part in the friday practice sessions , then of course you have to be looking at doing an actual race , " she told the @entity76			1
growing presence this may well be some time off though , with @entity30 @entity84 and @entity86 's @entity85 the two designated drivers for the forthcoming season			0
@entity6 is not even the team 's reserve driver since that role is taken by another @entity30 , 21 - year - old @entity92			2
having competed in the @entity22 @entity94 ( @entity95 ) for seven years , the @entity93 is married to @entity96 , a former @entity16 executive director who now holds that role at @entity97			1
yet @entity16 ' chief technical officer @entity98 is adamant that @entity6 deserves her place in the paddock			2
" @entity6 has become a valued member of our driver line up and 2014 will see her take on more responsibilities as we seek to make a strong step forward in performance , " he told williamsf1.com			0
" @entity6 has demonstrated a natural talent for developing a car and providing strong feedback and these sort of characteristics will be key this season as teams seek to quickly understand and refine the radically overhauled 2014 cars			0
'' @entity6 joined @entity16 in april 2012 and has been credited with helping to develop various cars			1
having impressed in a test at @entity57 last year , @entity6 can boast good knowledge of both the track for the @entity18 grand prix and @entity120 -- following her experiences there in @entity95			0
the news of @entity6 's role comes 10 days after @entity125 driver @entity124 joined @entity126 with a view to competing in @entity5 next year			1
" after four years in @entity130 , @entity124 's ambition is to enter formula one in 2015 , " said team principal @entity128			0
" we regard her as a very talented race driver , and we , therefore , decided to take her on board as an " affiliated driver " and support her on her way to the pinnacle of motorsport			0
" @entity128 is one of several women in @entity5 , with @entity16 working as deputy principal at the @entity16 team founded by father @entity143 in 1977 -- one year after the last woman drove an @entity5 race .			1
