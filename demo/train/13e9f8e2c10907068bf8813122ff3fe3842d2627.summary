-- @entity1 is one of the rare performers to have won an @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 award			1
but it took her nearly a lifetime to feel comfortable playing herself			2
the 81 - year - old @entity11 legend , who will be awarded a @entity12 in january , credits her ability to adapt quickly as key to her survival in life and the limelight			1
she was 5 years old when she and her mother braved a perilous ocean voyage from @entity11 to @entity20 , before boarding a bus to the @entity22 to stay with relatives			1
" my mami , @entity27 , was looking for a new start , a new husband , " @entity24 wrote in her memoir			1
" she was seeking love and fortune			2
... " her mother 's girlfriend suggested putting little @entity34 into dance classes , and soon , she was learning @entity37 dance from @entity39 's uncle , who was also her dance teacher			1
@entity24 found a home on the stage , and as her talent grew , she was able to contribute to her own , and her mother 's dreams			1
in her memoir , now available in @entity37 , she shares her journey			1
@entity24 went from dancing in bars to performing for bar mitzvahs and independent movies			1
she was invited to a fateful " go - see " with @entity51 of the @entity53 film studio			2
the 16 - year - old did her best to dress as her inspiration to impress the studio head			2
" ' she looks like a @entity37 @entity61 ! ' " @entity24 recalls @entity51 saying at their meeting			1
" ' how does a seven - year contract sound to you , young lady ? ' " @entity1 was born in @entity65 , @entity11 , but @entity1 was hatched in @entity66 , @entity67			1
an @entity53 studio executive christened her in honor of @entity39			2
" your name has to go , " he told her			2
" over a decades - long run , she survived a contentious affair with @entity75 , a suicide attempt and unpredictable employment to build one of the most storied careers in entertainment			2
now , as she prepares to play a grandmother on @entity83 's " @entity82 , " @entity24 shared with @entity0 the struggle to find her own identity , when she stopped trying to be her idols and why she rejected playing @entity88 's mother on his hit tv show			1
an edited transcript of the conversation is below			2
@entity0 : what incredible accomplishments : an @entity4 , a @entity6 , an @entity5 , a @entity7 , and now the @entity93			0
how does all that fit with how you perceive yourself ? @entity24 : i do n't know how to answer that question -- it 's all pretty fabulous			1
you know i 'm 81 now			0
i 'm going to be 82 in december and i stand here absolutely astonished at what 's happened ! inevitably , when something very prestigious and meaningful like the @entity93 awards happens , i immediately go back to @entity11 and my little hometown and i see this little girl and i go back to being that little girl ! and i 'm saying , " is it really possible ? " " is this really happening ? " i ca n't tell you how stunned i am			1
i 'm thrilled to pieces			0
@entity0 : one of the things you describe in the book is playing the role of the " spitfire " and various stereotypical roles of people of color in your desire to work , but you describe your personality as being very different : " quite prudent and conservative " when you first came to @entity121			0
@entity24 : you know , i spent a good part of my life looking for an identity that was safe			1
and , in retrospect , we all know that that is simply not possible , it 's not feasible			1
i did n't want to be this " @entity132 girl			0
" i did n't want to be this " sexpot			0
" i had no role models , so i chose one : @entity61			0
but that does n't work			0
and what happens as a result is you live a very muddled life with respect to identity			1
and when you try to do that , you lose something extremely valuable and important : and that is , self - respect			0
and the struggle was very painful			0
@entity0 : when do you feel like you stopped " trying to be @entity61 " and began embracing @entity1 ? @entity24 : well , you know it really did n't happen until " @entity150			1
" it took , unhappily , a very long time			0
that happened with the @entity4 , and then of course i also got the @entity155 ( for best supporting actress in " @entity150 " ) , which was pretty fabulous			1
i said to myself " i must be worth something			0
" and then i had the heartbreak of my life , practically , because i did n't do a movie again for seven years			1
i was offered a couple of gang - type movies , and you know i was n't going to do that anymore			0
once i had that little gold man under my arm , i said to myself : " that 's it			2
" @entity0 : so " @entity150 " really affirmed your talents and you , personally			0
for you as an actress , what determines what roles are stereotypical and which ones are true to life ? @entity24 : well , gee , that 's not a hard question to answer			1
i mean it 's the way it 's written			2
you 're either a coffee pourer , or you play someone that 's real			2
( before the @entity88 ) show went on the air , ( @entity88 ) wanted me desperately to play his mother and i just kept saying that is the most disrespectful @entity132 woman i have ever seen and i ca n't do that			0
i mean , he really courted me , he sent me bottles of wine and stuff , " i 'm here because of you , " that kind of thing			0
and , i know he meant it , he was very sincere and respectful but i just thought that she gave all of us a very bad name			0
i know she was funny , but i just could n't see myself doing that part , it really bothered me			2
and you know , by the way , the lady who played it was wonderful ! and what a darling woman			0
@entity206 , what a neat gal she was			0
but i could n't do that			0
i had been there and i had done that , in a manner of speaking , and i just could n't do that again			0
@entity0 : has there been a difference in how audiences have responded to your memoir in @entity37 versus @entity217 ? @entity24 : it 's surprising to the ( @entity217 ) speaking people and @entity132 people because both of them have always seen me as a very strong personality			1
you know the @entity225 ( have seen me as ) @entity226 ( the pride of @entity11 )			1
and @entity229 have always seen me that way , too			0
so ( my ) struggle is a huge surprise to everybody			0
they just think you got this way overnight			0
and i keep telling them , you know what ? it took me 81 years to reach this @entity1 !			1

actress @entity1 's new memoir is out in @entity37
she was born @entity1 in @entity11 , raised in @entity20
