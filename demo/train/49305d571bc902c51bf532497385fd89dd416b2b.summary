-- if you follow scientific developments as if they were football games , this would be a good time to cheer " tick - tick - tick - tick ! tick - tick - tick - tick ! go , clock , go ! " the reason for such enthusiasm ? researchers have released a study in the journal @entity12 describing what they believe is the world 's most precise clock			1
you 'd never need this level of precision for getting to work on time , but the clock could be used for scientific exploration and technological advancements in areas such as navigation systems , said study co-author @entity26 , researcher at the @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
the rate of ticking of this timepiece -- known informally ( and awkwardly ) as the ytterbium optical lattice clock -- does not change by more than one part in 10 ^ 18 , @entity26 said			1
in other words , if there is any variation in how a second is measured , it would be in about the 18th decimal place			0
" the ytterbium optical lattice clock has demonstrated a groundbreaking , new level of clock stability , " he said			1
" one could say that this is like measuring time over a hundred years to a precision of several nanoseconds			2
" in order to understand what 's so special about this table - sized clock , it helps to have a little background : how clocks work inside a clock is a mechanism that changes in some regular way , called an oscillator			2
imagine , for example , a grandfather clock , whose pendulum swings back and forth denoting time			2
in a wrist watch there is often a crystal with an electrically oscillating signal			0
a particular number of " back and forths " corresponds to one second			0
an atomic clock makes use of an electromagnetic signal -- in other words , light emitted at an exact , known frequency			1
at the core of the system , there is an atom			0
the light is used to excite an electron in the atom			0
in this model , the excitation and de-excitation of an electron corresponds to a pendulum swinging right to left , but in an atomic clock , the " tick " denotes an unimaginably tiny fraction of a second			1
the current gold standard for time is the cesium clock , a type of atomic clock that an international body of experts has used to define what is the unit of one second : about 9.19 billion oscillations			1
in this clock , a microwave light source is used to excite electrons in cesium atoms			1
but the new atomic clock at @entity27 , described in the @entity12 study , uses a different element : @entity107 , atomic number 70			1
optical light -- specifically , yellow light from a laser with a wavelength of 578 nanometers -- is used to excite the electrons of ytterbium atoms			1
whereas scientists talk about billions of oscillations per second in the cesium clock , oscillations per second in the ytterbium clock approach one quadrillion per second , @entity26 said			1
the new clock is akin to a ruler that has markers for fractions of inches , compared to a ruler that only delineates inches			2
the first instrument would make more precise measurements			2
" you divide time into finer and finer intervals , " @entity26 said			0
in order to establish the precision of this clock , the scientists had to make two of them , to confirm agreement in the measurement of time			1
the devices wo n't fit on your wrist , or even on your wall			0
because of all the laser equipment and technology necessary for this level of precision , the atomic clock and all of its components occupy a space about the size of a dining room table , @entity26 said			1
efforts are under way to shrink the technology , however , particularly so that a version of it might be sent into space			1
potential uses researchers studying @entity162 's theory of general relativity could make use of this clock to more precisely measure how time is different depending on the surrounding gravitational force			2
global positioning systems ( gps ) already take this into account			0
because they are farther from @entity173 than we are , and therefore experience less gravitational pull , their measurement of time as they orbit @entity173 is slightly different from what we perceive on the ground			0
a more precise atomic clock could measure the correctional factors even better			1
such clocks could also test alternative theories about the relationship between time and gravity			0
there could be other applications for navigation and communications systems			0
but you probably wo n't want one for your alarm clock			2
@entity26 said the total cost ranges on the order of a half - million dollars			0
accuracy although scientists have proclaimed that this is the world 's most stable clock , they do not yet know as much about its accuracy			0
this is a subtle but important difference : the ytterbium clock has demonstrated incredible stability of measurement -- it always measures a second in the same way -- but we do not yet know if what it is measuring is a " true " second			2
so , we 'll have to wait to find out whether these clocks could be the most accurate in the world			0
it 's a story we hear time and time again			0
follow @entity219 on @entity220 and @entity221 .			0

new study describes atomic clock with *unprecedented* precision
clock is made with atoms of the element ytterbium
device is at the @entity27 in @entity29
efforts are under way to make the technology small enough to send into space
