-- a federal appeals court sided with the government monday , allowing the military to maintain its " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy during an appeal of a lower court ruling that the law barring openly gay and lesbian soldiers is unconstitutional			1
the ruling by a three - judge panel of the 9th @entity11 means that the policy remains in place while the government appeals a federal judge 's ruling against it			1
one of the three judges on the panel dissented against parts of monday 's decision			0
in response to the panel 's ruling , the @entity24 , a @entity26 gay rights group that filed the lawsuit against the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , can now appeal it to the full @entity31 appellate court and or make an emergency application directly to the @entity34 @entity33			1
@entity35 , an attorney with @entity36 who represents the @entity24 , said the appeal would continue and he raised the possibility of seeking emergency relief from the nation 's highest court			2
" we will continue to fight on for the constitutional rights of these @entity34 and look forward to a favorable decision on the merits of the appeal , " @entity35 said in a statement			0
" meanwhile , we will discuss the court 's order with our client to determine whether we will ask for a review of the order by the @entity34 @entity33			1
" in monday 's ruling , the judges said they had to weigh the harm of continuing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy against the potential harm in forcing the military to drop the policy before it is ready			1
" we conclude that the government 's colorable allegations that the lack of an orderly transition in policy will produce immediate harm and precipitous injury are convincing , " the ruling said			1
" @entity69 " means the court believes the allegations have a reasonable chance of being found valid			2
" we also conclude that the public interest in ensuring orderly change of this magnitude in the military -- if that is what is to happen -- strongly militates in favor of a stay , " the ruling said			0
@entity80 spokesman col. @entity79 told @entity0 in an e-mail message that the appellate panel 's decision was " appropriate			1
" in their ruling , the judges also noted that legislation pending before @entity87 to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot			1
the @entity90 has passed a repeal provision , and the @entity92 is expected to consider it as part of a broader defense authorization bill when it returns for a lame - duck session in mid-november			0
president @entity97 wants to repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy and reached an agreement with defense secretary @entity100 and adm. @entity101 , the chairman of the @entity103 , on a process that includes a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving alongside straight colleagues			0
@entity97 , @entity100 and @entity101 would then have to certify the repeal			0
the case puts @entity97 's administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal but filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned			1
the legislation before @entity87 includes the process for repeal agreed to with @entity100 and @entity101			0
in response to the court case , @entity100 recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under " do n't ask , do n't tell " by ordering that it only be done by the secretaries of the @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			2
in a memo written to the heads of all the military services , @entity100 said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding " do n't ask , do n't tell " law and policy			0
" effective immediately and until further notice , no military member shall be separated ... without the personal approval of the secretary of the military department concerned , in coordination with the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness and the general counsel of the @entity80			2
these functions may not be delegated , " @entity100 wrote			0
@entity0 's @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this story .			0
