four years ago , a young female journalist driving home from work at 3 a.m. was shot dead in her car in @entity5 's capital , @entity6			1
the state 's chief minister , @entity7 , a woman , remarked that the girl was returning home all by herself " at night in a city where people believe ... you know ... you should not be so adventurous			2
" this week , a 23 - year - old woman , accompanied by a male friend , boarded a bus on a busy road in the capital at 9 p.m. , only to be brutally raped by a group of men			1
she was then savagely beaten , stripped and thrown onto the road			0
the girl and her friend , who was attacked for trying to protect her , were returning home after watching a movie			0
she is battling for life in hospital , according to her doctors			0
@entity5 's rising rape cases -- one every 22 minutes , according to the @entity30 -- betray what is wrong with society			1
millions of @entity5 continue to believe that women invite trouble on themselves by being careless			1
mothers often chide daughters for wearing provocative clothing , in most cases a sleeveless garment or a pair of hip - hugging jeans			0
in cities such as @entity6 , easily the most - policed state in the country , few women will take public or private transport unescorted after nightfall			1
more than 600 rape cases have been reported in @entity6 alone this year , according to government records			2
worse still , many more go unreported because a large number feel insecure about reporting rape or even sexual harassment to lawmakers , either because they are not taken seriously or because in several cases the protectors have turned perpetrators			0
earlier this month , a girl who was raped in her village by four men , was then allegedly raped by a police officer who was handling her case , according to medical examiners			2
she had to be rescued by a police team that raided the hotel where she was being held			0
the incident happened in @entity67 , which borders @entity6			2
around the same time in @entity68 , another northern state , an officer who was protecting his daughter against sexual harassment -- locally referred to as " @entity72 " -- was shot dead in public view , allegedly by a local political party member who was troubling her			0
the truth is , when most women report sexual harassment in @entity5 's cities , towns and villages , they are typically met with a shrug			1
slowly , but firmly , the onus of remaining safe seems to have shifted to women , instead of being shared by society and law - keepers			0
at a protest rally held in the city on tuesday , when women waved placards saying : " do n't teach me what to wear , teach men not to rape , " it was meant as a wake - up call for society , for mothers and fathers , for law - keepers as well as lawmakers			2
other posters saying : " do n't get raped , " with words crossed out to read : " do n't rape , " were a chilling reminder of how vulnerable and isolated women feel in @entity5			1
@entity5 's apparent nonchalance towards sexual harassment has escalated into a major crisis			1
and we 're not just talking about the odd sly remark or attempt to grope a woman but far more serious assaults			0
@entity5 's misplaced tolerance has helped this cascade into a brutal , violent menace			1
