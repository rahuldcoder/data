@entity0 -- @entity2 will create a new fiscal authority to oversee the new spending cuts , tax increases and structural adjustments included in a new budget presented thursday			1
the country is in an economic crisis with an unemployment rate near 25 % , and protests have grown against austerity measures , such as the ones included in the new budget			1
despite the budget crunch , vice president @entity14 said there will be increases in pensions , scholarships and interest on debt			2
but the budget also includes large reductions in spending in an effort to reduce deficits			1
the budgets of all ministries will be reduced by an average of 12 % , @entity27 said			0
the package includes a " road map " of 43 proposed laws that will regulate and tweak various sectors of the economy to spur growth in weak areas and to maintain growth in stronger sectors			1
for the third year in a row , salaries of public workers will be frozen			0
" this is a budget made in a time of crisis , but precisely to get out of the crisis , " @entity27 said			0
@entity2 , which has one of the largest economies in @entity49 , is fighting to bring down its huge deficit , which threatens the stability of the euro , the currency used by hundreds of millions of people across @entity49			1
prime minister @entity55 said in july that the country would cut 65 billion euros ( $ 83 billion ) from the budget in three years by raising taxes and shrinking bureaucracy			1

demonstrators said police were shooting into the crowd with rubber bullets ; police would not comment			0
" we have you surrounded , " some demonstrators sang			0
" we have no fear			0
" at one point , @entity2 police charged demonstrators with batons to prevent them from approaching the parliament , which was in session			1
the protesters accused the government and the opposition alike of trying to solve the country 's financial woes on the backs of the people			1
video from the scene showed police charging groups of protesters with their clubs , but such clashes were isolated			0
tuesday 's protest seems to have been the most violent in the capital this year , but it was only one of an estimated 1,900 demonstrations in @entity0 in 2012 , according to government figures			2
the country is suffering from soaring borrowing costs , a banking system leaking cash and unemployment rates at devastating levels			2
it has been in recession since april , and analysts think the economic situation will get worse before it gets better			2
" growth is likely to be weak for a prolonged period , " said @entity118 , an economist at @entity119 in @entity120			0
" more austerity will be needed			2
" the @entity124 said wednesday that it expects economic activity in the second quarter to continue to weaken			0
it estimated that gross domestic product will shrink 1.3 %			0
that would be the third straight quarter of contraction			0
' too big to fail , too big to bail ' @entity131 may be the country risking expulsion from the eurozone , but @entity2 's situation is potentially of much greater concern			1
if such a major economy were to fail , the repercussions could cause unprecedented havoc across @entity49 -- and the globe			1
the @entity2 economy is the eurozone 's fourth - largest -- after @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 -- making up around 11 % of the bloc 's gdp			1
to put that in perspective , @entity131 , @entity147 and @entity148 -- the three eurozone countries that have already been bailed out -- combined make up less than 6 % of the bloc 's economy			1
prime minister @entity55 has tough targets to meet in order to cut the deficit			0
@entity158 , an economist at @entity159 , says " substantial efforts " will be required to meet a budget deficit target of 4.5 %			0
pension reforms are possible , such as fast - tracking plans to increase the retirement age to 67 from 65 , while taxation and labor markets could also be targeted , @entity158 noted			2
the budget will be followed by friday 's release of the country 's banking audit , which is expected to reveal details of the sector 's financial needs			2
the consensus is that the banks need an injection of around 60 billion euros ( $ 77 billion ) , and " too low a number will raise concerns that there are more hidden losses to come -- all the more given the very frail economic backdrop , " @entity158 wrote in an analysis			0
as it stands , the banks have an estimated 300 billion euros in problem loans on their books , with the full cost of recovery not yet clear			0
@entity189 finance ministers agreed in june to give aid to @entity2 's banking sector , but @entity55 has insisted that the government does not need a bailout			1
@entity2 , in its second recession since 2009 , has been dubbed " too big to fail , too big to bail			1
" the country also has an unemployment crisis , with more than half those younger than 24 out of work , and almost one in four people overall			2
@entity2 's jobless rate has helped pushed the eurozone 's total unemployment rate to 11 % -- its highest since the eurozone was created in 1999			1
why is the economy collapsing now ? the situation in @entity2 has developed like a perfect storm , with money being pulled out of the country , despite the desperate need to stem capital flight and support its banking system			1
this leaves @entity2 in a precarious financial state , driving investors away , pushing up its borrowing costs and making it more likely to need a bailout			1
it 's a reminder of how governments are inextricably tied to their countries ' banking systems , essentially the lifeblood of their economy			2
the struggles in @entity49 have been exacerbated by continued gloomy news out of the @entity226 @entity227 reported from @entity0 , @entity228 from @entity120 and @entity229 from @entity230			0
@entity232 's @entity231 , @entity233 and @entity234 , and @entity1 's @entity235 contributed to this report .			0
