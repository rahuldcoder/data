@entity0 , @entity1 -- the disruptive days of thunderous , fuel - guzzling planes hovering in our skies could be a thing of the past			1
so too could the tortuous queues and endless boarding process , if futuristic flight concepts become reality			0
since the first commercial passenger flight in 1914 , 65 billion passengers have taken to the skies and another 65 billion are expected to do the same before 2030			0
and experts say efficient , greener performance is what will steer aviation into the next century			2
" a major breakthrough in an airliner will bring half a percent , 1 % greater fuel efficiency , which does n't sound like much -- but to an airline , it 's huge			1
it 's millions of dollars ( in savings ) a year , " said @entity25 , chair and curator of air transportation at the @entity28			1
the @entity31 is the world 's biggest passenger aircraft , and its future depends on constant redevelopment and improving performance			1
the energy problem is one of the major drivers for the company , @entity37 , corporate innovator for @entity31 , told @entity2 's @entity43			1
" we have to do something about it			0
reducing fuel burn is one way , and we have been very successful in the past			2
" the @entity31 vision of the future can be seen through its concept plane design , which is packed with the stuff made of engineering dreams			1
one concept feature is dubbed " eco-climb , " where take off is assisted by propelled acceleration for a steeper climb , so that planes reach efficient cruise altitudes sooner			2
in the concept cabin , seats will use body heat to power aircraft systems such as holographic pop - up pods , while a futuristic cabin membrane can become transparent to give passengers open panoramic views			0
what 's more , @entity31 has radical ideas for speedier boarding			2
" we could think about city center check - in and actually transport little pods to the airport where the passengers are already in and just slide the pod into the airplane , " said @entity37			0
some of the full - blown features of the @entity31 concept plane will become a reality later this century , according to @entity37 , but parts of the vision are already being implemented in the current fleet			1
titanium brackets used in the cabin have been made using 3 - d printing , reducing the weight of the parts , and allowing the manufacture of " organic " shapes that would otherwise be too expensive to produce			0
" this is going to be a big revolution in manufacturing , " predicted @entity91			0
" passengers wo n't see it much but they get more choice and they got it cheaper and earlier			0

@entity100 's future must be efficient , greener and easier as air *traffic* grows
just 1 % greater fuel efficiency means millions in savings for airlines
cabins with glass - top *ceilings* are part of the @entity31 vision
