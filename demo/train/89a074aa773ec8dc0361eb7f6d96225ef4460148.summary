@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's renowned resort town of @entity0 that attracts millions of tourists from around the world is growing tired of its most famous guest : @entity7			1
the ousted president , say residents , is bad for business			1
" we want him to leave , " said @entity11 , a construction worker who lives here			2
" he has created a lot of problems and affected tourism			1
" added @entity18 , who runs a limousine service : " everbody wants " @entity7 to leave			1
" @entity17 now is no good ... my business is nothing now			1
" @entity11 spoke across the street from @entity25 , where @entity7 has been staying under heavy police protection since prosecutors began questioning him on tuesday			1
the sight of helmeted riot police forming a human chain of black uniforms around the perimeter of the pyramid - shaped hospital , contrasted sharply with the palm trees , souvenir shops and sun - burned @entity38 tourists who wander past , staring curiously at them			1
this week , @entity1 's general prosecutor officially detained @entity7 for 15 days in connection with the deaths of hundreds of activists during the street protests that toppled him from power on february 11			1
his two sons , @entity48 and @entity49 , were transferred to @entity51 's @entity50 this week			1
@entity1 's revolution succeeded in toppling a once - untouchable dictator			1
but it has also crippled the country 's vital tourism industry , which according to some conservative estimates , accounts for 10 % of the @entity1 economy			1
@entity0 , an international scuba - diving and nightclubbing mecca that normally welcomes an estimated 5 million tourists a year , has been particularly hit hard			1
the beaches in " @entity25 , " as locals affectionately call it , are all but deserted			2
the once bustling harbor in @entity65 is mostly quiet , except for the occasional motorboat puttering past pulling squealing tourists riding inner - tubes			2
hotel operators estimated they were below 30 % capacity at what is normally the peak tourist season			2
" you need to be at 35 % just to break even , " said @entity73 , manager of the @entity74			2
in the last half of february , the hotel was at 6 % to 8 % capacity			0
@entity73 estimated the current free - fall in tourism receipts is worse than decline after three deadly bombings in @entity1 's @entity83 in 2004 , and after a series of shark attacks last november			1
@entity87 tourist @entity86 said she did n't think twice about bring her teenage son and daughter to @entity0			1
" its no different from the possible threat in @entity94 , " she said , sitting in a rooftop swimming pool with a view of the @entity92			0
" you 're just as likely to get blown up riding the @entity97 , " she added , referring to @entity94 's subway system			2
still , the political instability gripping @entity51 kept @entity86 from visiting the pyramids			0
her 15 - year - old son , @entity100 , was surprised to see the cordon of riot police outside of the @entity0 's hospital			1
" it was pretty cool , " he said			0
" i did n't know the president was staying there			0
there are scary guards all over the place			0
so i feel pretty safe			0
" asked why tourists stopped coming , hotel and nightclub operator @entity112 had one simple answer : the revolution			0
" for the first time in the history of @entity1 for 7,000 years a pharaoh is being investigated			0
his whole family is being investigated , " @entity118 said			0
but @entity118 , who says he opened the first grocery store and hotel in @entity0 when it was little more than a desert campground in the 1980s , hopes @entity1 's largely peaceful revolution will pay off in the long run			1
" @entity1 is no longer enslaved			0
@entity1 is free and open to the world through peaceful means , " he said			0
" this will bring tourists back in large numbers and this is what the country needs			0
" @entity1 still has a long way to go before its security forces embrace transparency			0
secret police accosted a @entity2 camera - man as he was filming a sunset over the @entity92 on friday			2
without showing any identification , the plain - clothed officers tried to confiscate the camera before finally being convinced no state secrets had been filmed			0
not far away , workers outside a souvenir shop called out an often - repeated motto to passing tourists			2
" welcome to @entity1 , " they said .			0
