-- how much has the @entity1 changed ? that 's the question at the heart of one of the most important cases the @entity6 will take up this year			1
the case weighs the fate of one of the most important laws in @entity12 history : the @entity13			1
a century after the @entity15 , @entity14 created that law to give @entity17 the right to vote , not just on paper , but in fact			0
the key provision was @entity22 , which decreed that jurisdictions with histories of discrimination , mostly in the @entity1 , had to get @entity27 approval before they changed any aspect of their voting rules , right down to the location of polling places			1
there is little doubt that , in the years immediately after 1965 , the @entity13 achieved a revolution in voting rights for african - americans in the @entity1			1
in subsequent years , @entity14 has reauthorized the law several times , most recently in 2006			0
increasingly , covered jurisdictions have found the process of submitting their changes to the @entity27 , which is known as " pre-clearance , " as a demeaning anachronism , and @entity45 , @entity46 , went to court to argue that the @entity13 was unconstitutional			1
the court will hear the case , @entity49 , early next year			0
the @entity51 administration strongly supports the act , but the president 's election -- and re-election -- may be among the best arguments against the law			2
there is little doubt that african - americans suffered pervasive discrimination in the 1960s , especially at the polls			2
but now we have a black president			0
does n't that prove that african - americans have reached at least rough equality in the electoral realm ? not necessarily			0
when reauthorizing the law , @entity14 compiled a record of thousands of pages documenting the legacy of discrimination that lingers in the covered jurisdictions			2
the government asserts that the justices should defer to @entity14 in deciding whether the problem of voting rights is solved			1
still , the @entity51 administration has to deal with a very important likely adversary in this case : chief justice @entity82			1
the court heard a similar challenge to the @entity13 in 2009 , and the court sidestepped the core issue , resolving the case on procedural grounds			0
but there was little doubt , in @entity82 ' questions at oral argument or in his opinion , that he believes , constitutionally speaking , times have changed			2
the chief is unlikely to look for a procedural way out of controversy for a second time			2
the controversy over voter suppression in the 2012 elections might have a paradoxical effect on the future of the law			0
@entity104 argued that the efforts to impose voter id requirements and the like amounted to discrimination against african - americans and thus could be seen as justification for preserving the @entity13			2
but several of the acts of alleged voter suppression took place in states -- like @entity115 and @entity116 -- that are not covered by @entity22 of the act			0
that may help the plaintiff 's core argument : times have changed in the @entity1			1
in any event , it 's likely to be a close vote			0
what happens if the law is overturned ? the answer may be : not much			0
the @entity1 may not need the act anymore to protect the voting rights of minorities			1
if that 's true , that would prove the plaintiffs ' main argument in this case			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			1

@entity141 secured voting rights for blacks in the @entity1
@entity46 county takes it to @entity6 , saying act is unconstitutional
@entity139 : is it still necessary ? does discrimination still exist in the @entity1 ?
@entity139 : ruling will be close , with chief justice *roberts* likely to *oppose* @entity12 argument
