-- twice defending champion @entity1 moved closer to a @entity3 title hat - trick on monday when fourth - round rival @entity4 left in tears after quitting their @entity7 match through injury			1
@entity4 concedes to holder @entity1 in tearful fashion after suffering injury anguish at @entity3 @entity13 's former world number one lost the first set 6 - 1 against third - seeded @entity15 rival @entity1 and was serving in the first game of the second when she was forced to stop because of a thigh problem			1
thirteenth - seed @entity4 returned to court after treatment to win the game , but then quit the match -- handing @entity1 a place in the last eight in a highly - emotional moment			1
" it 's very disappointing , especially because i felt my form was getting better and better			0
it 's really frustrating , " @entity4 told media while still struggling to regain her composure			1
" the most disappointing thing is i felt like i was n't given a fair chance to fight			0
all of a sudden i felt pain after a serve			0
i did n't feel anything up until that point			0
" over past few days i have felt muscle tightness , but that was normal after playing so much on the grass			0
" i was serving at 30 - 40 down and when i landed i just felt a sharp pain on my inner thigh and i could n't step on my leg ever since			0
" @entity1 now faces @entity45 's @entity44 , the 11th seed , as she bids to become the first woman to lift three successive @entity3 singles ' titles since @entity50 from 1991 to 1993			1

@entity79 , semifinalist a year ago , hardly broke sweat as temperatures soared , the fourth seed defeating fellow @entity70 blonde @entity83 6 - 1 6 - 3 in 70 minutes on @entity84			2

world number one @entity93 , who has yet to win a @entity96 title , faced 2006 champion @entity97 on @entity98 -- and @entity3 's new roof was shut for the first time during their match when rain fell midway through the second set			1
