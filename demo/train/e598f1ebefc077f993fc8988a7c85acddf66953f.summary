@entity0 , @entity1 -- an unassuming town on the southern tip of @entity1 is an unlikely place for one of the world 's most advanced buildings			1
until august 12 the city of @entity0 is hosting @entity10 and among the new buildings containing educational displays on ocean conservation is the @entity1 pavilion			1
it stands out as one of the most technologically advanced , if aesthetically underwhelming , of them all			2
korean architecture firm @entity17 designed it to resemble the @entity20 ' @entity19 ' -- the yin and yang symbol of balance -- but inside the structure that concept of harmony is taken even further			0
at a cost of around $ 19.5 million it combines the latest in hydrogen fuel cell technology , photovoltaic solar panels and geo - thermal energy to provide power , cooling and heating , making it carbon negative -- taking out more co2 from the atmosphere than it produces			1
@entity20 firm @entity36 provided the fuel cells that are key to the company 's development of next generation hydrogen - fuelled cars , while architects from @entity17 say that other engineering elements , like the seawater thermal pipes , are there to demonstrate their potential future use			1
while @entity46 have long been associated with experimental and iconic architecture -- the @entity48 of 1889 gave @entity49 the @entity50 -- not much of it has stood the test of time			2
the @entity1 pavilion however will be one of the few structures that remains on the site once the expo has ended			1
another is the @entity59 that tests architectural and engineering limits in a different way from its national namesake , by being as low - tech as possible			1
the @entity65 architects were not even sure that the structure could even be built			1
" the biomimetic principles ( of the building ) had not been built before on that scale , " said @entity67 of @entity68			2
one vast side of the building is covered with reinforced fiberglass " gills " that can be opened and closed to either provide shade or ventilation			1
" really it 's based on material performance ; it 's not a mechanism moving but the material itself , transforming , " said @entity67			0
" it 's an idea deduced from plants , how you can configure the geometry and how you can use certain characteristics ( of the building ) so you use less energy			0
" @entity92 renewable energy engineers @entity93 installed the solar panels on the roof and have designed a seawater heat exchange system that will provide additional cooling and lead to 80 % of the building 's energy originating from renewable sources			0
as well as the importance of eco-friendly elements , @entity67 says that the spirit of adventure and experimentalism , in keeping with the history of @entity46 , was a key part of the design process			0
" the architectural scene ( at @entity46 ) at least is something where you can really see things that are being tried out			0
the task is not to make an envelope for a function but to do something that is an experience in itself , " she says			0
" on the one hand the architect has to do less , but on the other side much more			0
it has to be extraordinary , which is why architects love @entity46			2

expo 2012 in @entity1 is site of cutting - edge experimental buildings
@entity1 pavilion is hi - tech and carbon - negative
theme pavilion draws on concepts of *biomimicry* with ventilation ' gills '
architects of theme pavilion were not sure it could be built
