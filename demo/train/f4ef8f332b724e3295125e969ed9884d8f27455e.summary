-- @entity1 vowed to push @entity2 for the 2013 world title when their champion @entity5 team launched its new @entity8 car on sunday			1
the veteran @entity9 has had to play second fiddle to the all - conquering @entity2 in the past three seasons , despite at stages being in contention for his maiden championship			1
he has had to contend with recent criticism from @entity5 's motor sport advisor @entity18 , who claimed the 36 - year - old ca n't cope with the title pressure			1
" i do believe i can have a crack at the championship again this year , as i have done in previous seasons , " @entity1 told reporters at the @entity24 's launch at the team 's @entity26 headquarters in @entity28			1
" that is my goal and what i think about each day when i get up , and i 'm working hard with the team on doing that			0
" they know i need 100 % support			0
you can not win a world title with only 90 , you need 100 , and we 're going into 2013 with this in place , and i 'm comfortable with that			2
" team boss @entity44 , who signed a new multi-year contract last week , backed @entity1 to be a contender despite him finishing sixth overall last season -- 102 points behind his teammate			1
" if we were n't happy with @entity1 then we would never have signed him to be with the team for this year , " he said			1
" we 're very happy with @entity1 and we give both drivers equal opportunity			2
it 's ultimately down to what they do on the circuit			0
" for us , it does n't matter which driver wins , as long as it is a driver in one of our cars			0
both of these guys believe they are the best , and the team will do the very best it can to support them			0
" @entity2 became the youngest driver to win three world titles as he overhauled @entity69 's @entity68 in the final third of the season			1
" it all starts again from zero			0
we 've all got the same chances in what will be a tough year again with a lot of races , " the 25 - year - old @entity73 said			1
" so i 'm just looking ahead			2
i 'm not looking back on past races because i am convinced it does n't give you a head start or an advantage			0
" obviously , the expectations are still there , but more than that we expect ourselves to do well again , so there is a lot of pressure			0
" right now there is excitement to get back into the car , start testing , then go racing and find out where we are			2
it 's one thing to do all the talking now , but as soon as you have the helmet on , you simply want to perform and do your best			0
