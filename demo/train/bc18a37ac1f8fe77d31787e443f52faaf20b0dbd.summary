-- @entity2 's @entity1 teed off thursday at @entity3 in @entity4			1
we dug through the championship 's history to find some crucial details ( and trivial moments , too how old is the tournament ? the @entity11 of @entity12 hosted the first @entity1 in 1895 with far less fanfare than the modern tournament receives			1
instead of a mad scramble to make the elite field , the competition only had 11 entrants , each of whom played a nine - hole course four times in a single day			2
the @entity1 was n't even the main draw on the course that week ; spectators and golfers were much more preoccupied with the first playing of @entity28 @entity27 at the club , which made the @entity1 something of an afterthought			1
at the end of play , @entity33 @entity32 claimed the title and pocketed $ 150 and a gold medal for his stellar performance			2
( he also made a compelling case for home - course advantage in golf ; by day the young champ was the assistant pro at ... you guessed it , the @entity11			0
) the @entity1 's been played ever since with two exceptions : a two - year break for @entity47 and a four - year gap during @entity49 so @entity28 dominated right off the bat , right ? hardly			1
although the tournament was called the @entity1 , winning was strictly a @entity54 affair in its early days			1
from 1895 to 1910 , @entity54 golfers won every year , including four wins by @entity58 immigrant @entity57			1
@entity28 did n't claim their own @entity1 until 1911 when @entity60 's @entity59 bested the field by three strokes			1
@entity59 , who was only 19 years old at the time of his victory , still holds the record for youngest @entity1 champ			1
just as impressively , he successfully defended his title the following year at the @entity11 of @entity68			0
@entity0 : music 's greatest golfers why is it called the @entity1 ? technically , the tournament is open to all comers rather than restricted to a certain group of golfers			1
both amateurs and professionals can compete in the event , so in theory , any golfer in the world is eligible for the field			0
thus , it 's an " open " tournament			2
of course , you ca n't just show up with your bag and shoes on thursday morning and expect to tee off with @entity87			0
golfers have to either qualify for the championship or gain an invitation through a qualifying exemption , which are given to past champions , recent champions of other major championships , top - ranked professionals , and other elite groups			0
amateurs with handicaps of 1.4 or less can play in the @entity1 if they make it through the qualifying process , which includes a local qualifying round and a sectional qualifying round			1
golfers who manage to qualify in this way had better behave themselves , though			0
the @entity106 's web site ominously warns that golfers are " subject to rejection at any time ( including during the @entity27 ) by the @entity106			0
the reason for rejection may include unbecoming conduct			0
" if @entity114 's been sliding by , though , it 's probably tough to get the boot			0
what 's the roughest time anyone 's had at the @entity1 ? it would be hard to beat @entity119 in the futility department			1
he took the course for the @entity123 at the @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126 , and proceeded to shoot a 157 in his opening round			1
during his second round the same day , he carved 57 strokes off of his score , but that only got him to a not - so - competitive 100			2
he then withdrew from the tournament			0
for a single hole , though , @entity133 gave @entity119 a run for his money			1
at the @entity137 at @entity138 in @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity133 hit into a creek on the 16th hole of his second round			2
rather than take a penalty , @entity133 thought he 'd try to hit the ball out of the water			0
when his first attempt was unsuccessful , he tried again			0
when the ball finally found its way onto dry land and into the cup , @entity133 had racked up a 19 - stroke hole , a record that still stands			0
that should make you feel better the next time you have to suck it up and take a drop			0
who was the unlikeliest champion ? that honor probably belongs to @entity161 , the former caddy who took the @entity162 at the course he used to patrol , the @entity11 of @entity164 , @entity126			0
although he was an amateur facing stiff competition from celebrated @entity54 pros like @entity167 and @entity168 , @entity161 managed to squeak out a victory following an 18 - hole playoff			1
fittingly , @entity161 's caddy made him look old ; 10 - year - old friend @entity172 skipped school to man the bag for @entity175 throughout the tournament			0
the national press hung on young @entity161 's gutsy performance against his @entity54 rivals , and the stunning win is credited with helping to popularize golf in the @entity28 sounds like a @entity184 movie , does n't it ? it is ; the story was adapted in 2005 as @entity187 starring @entity188 as @entity175			1
@entity0 : champion 's nickname or @entity4 bar ? why does n't @entity192 have five @entity1 titles ? amateur golfer @entity192 was undoubtedly one of the best golfers of all time , and he had the hardware to back it up : four @entity1 wins , another three wins in the @entity198 , and six more wins between the @entity200 and the @entity27			1
he might have had a fifth @entity1 title if he had n't been so honest , though			1
at the @entity202 , he was getting set to hit an iron shot out of the rough when he felt his club move the ball ever so slightly			2
no one else seemed to have seen this movement , but @entity192 called a penalty on himself			2
after officials were unable to confirm that the ball had actually moved , they allowed @entity192 to make his own ruling on whether or not he should be penalized			0
@entity192 said he was certain the ball had moved and penalized himself			0
the decision cost him the outright title , and he then lost a playoff to @entity217			0
spectators praised @entity192 for being so conscientious , but he would have none of it			0
he flatly replied , " you might as well praise me for not robbing banks			0
" who was the unhealthiest champ ? anyone who watched @entity226 win last year 's @entity1 while chain - smoking between shots might be surprised to learn the tobacco - loving @entity229 does n't hold this distinction			1
@entity232 's win at the @entity233 was as much a medical marvel as it was an athletic achievement after @entity232 got sick on his way to the tournament			2
he was n't just a little ill ; he was suffering from a case of amoebic dysentery that caused him to lose 15 pounds before the tournament began			1
for the first two rounds , @entity232 played well enough to lurk just eight strokes back on the leaderboard			2
the third round was disastrous , though			2
the dysentery acted up , and @entity232 dropped to 18th place			1
in the final round , though , he roared back despite feeling ill and being forced to subsist on sugar cubes			2
by shooting a final - round 72 , @entity232 passed @entity248 and @entity249 to win his only @entity1 crown by just one stroke			1
@entity253 mention in this category has to go to @entity255 , who won the 1964 @entity1 at the @entity256 in @entity257 , @entity258			1
the sweltering sun got to @entity255 in his final round , and he nearly collapsed from heat exhaustion			2
he eventually completed his victory under the watchful eye of a doctor			0
