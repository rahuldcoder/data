-- if one image can tell an entire story , this is a powerful example			2
the photo is set in a hospital room			1
a patient with a neck brace , tubes attached everywhere , draped in a red , white and blue quilt , is lying in a bed			2
his bandaged right arm is raised in what we now know is a salute			1
his face is mostly obscured , but the photo captures details such as the color of the patient 's hair , the shadow of what appears to be a large bruise on his left cheek and a @entity22 medal pinned to the quilt			1
the patient is cpl. @entity30 , 24			1

@entity32 was immediately pushed through a series of surgeries and emerged hours later into an intensive care unit here at our base in @entity38			1
despite being in intense pain and mental duress , @entity32 remained alert and compassionate to the limited @entity70 that were allowed to visit him bedside			2
" prior to @entity32 being moved to @entity72 for his eventual flight to @entity74 , we conducted a ceremony to award him with the @entity22 for wounds received in action			1
a simple ceremony , you can picture a room full of @entity70 , leaders , doctors , and nurses surrounding his bedside while the @entity87 regimental commander pinned the @entity22 to his blanket			1
" during the presentation the commander publishes the official orders verbally and leaned over @entity32 to thank him for his sacrifice			0
@entity32 , whom everybody in the room ( over 50 people ) assumed to be unconscious , began to move his right arm under the blanket in a diligent effort to salute the commander as is customary during these ceremonies			2
despite his wounds , wrappings , tubes , and pain , @entity32 fought the doctor who was trying to restrain his right arm and rendered the most beautiful salute any person in that room had ever seen			2
" i can not impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day			0
grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about @entity32 's courage and character			0
the picture , which we believe belongs on every news channel and every news paper is attached			0
i have it hanging above my desk now and will remember it as the single greatest event i have witnessed in my ten years in the @entity128			0
