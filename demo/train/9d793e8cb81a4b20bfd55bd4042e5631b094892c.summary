-- in an unusual step , @entity2 scientists interrupted testing of the refurbished @entity5 to aim the orbiter 's camera at @entity8 and capture an image of the planet 's mysterious new scar			1
the revamped @entity5 telescope captured these images of an impact scar near @entity8 's south pole			1
the resulting picture , taken thursday , is the sharpest visible - light photo of the dark spot and @entity5 's first science observation since astronauts repaired and upgraded it in may , @entity2 said			2
@entity23 - based telescopes have been trained on @entity8 since an amateur astronomer in @entity25 noticed the new mark , probably created when a small comet or asteroid plunged into @entity8 's atmosphere and disintegrated , early monday			1
but in its rarified orbit 347 miles above the @entity23 , the @entity5 has a better view of the gaseous planet			0
this week 's event marks only the second time scientists have recorded debris colliding with @entity8 , the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in our solar system			0
the appearance of the impact spot is changing day to day in the planet 's cloud tops , making it a priority for scientists to document it quickly			0
although the @entity5 is not expected to resume full operations until late summer and its new camera is still being calibrated , @entity2 scientists decided the @entity8 event was too significant not to put the orbiting observatory back into action for a day			1
" because we believe this magnitude of impact is rare , we are very fortunate to see it with @entity5 , " said @entity53 of @entity2 's @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			0
" details seen in the @entity5 view shows a lumpiness to the debris plume caused by turbulence in @entity8 's atmosphere			1
" @entity8 's colorful atmosphere is 86 percent hydrogen and 14 percent helium , with tiny amounts of methane , ammonia , phosphine , water , acetylene , ethane , germanium and carbon monoxide			1
the chemicals are responsible for producing the different colors of @entity8 's clouds			2
the object created a mark on @entity8 that has about same diameter as @entity23 , though the object itself was probably only 50 to 100 miles across , said @entity86 , the astronomer who first noticed the scar			2
the mystery object was probably moving at speeds of about 50 to 100 kilometers ( 31 to 62 miles ) per second when it struck near @entity8 's south pole , @entity86 said			2
the new image of @entity8 was taken with @entity5 's @entity92 , which was installed by the astronauts aboard space shuttle @entity94 in may			1
because it is still being calibrated , the camera 's full power has yet to be seen , @entity2 said			0
the @entity5 has been in orbit since 1990 and can capture images that telescopes on @entity23 ca n't , partly because it does n't have to gaze through the planet 's murky atmosphere			0
the unplanned @entity8 photo shoot will add delays to the recommissioning of @entity5 , @entity2 said			0
but scientists are at a point in the telescope 's reboot where they have enough flexibility to employ @entity5 to look at the unexpected astronomical event , they said .			0
