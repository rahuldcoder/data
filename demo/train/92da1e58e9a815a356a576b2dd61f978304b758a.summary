would he ever fly again , now that his feet and right hand were gone ? that was among the first things amateur pilot @entity4 wondered after he awoke from surgery in 2009			1
a blood disease similar to hemophilia forced doctors to make him a triple amputee , removing his right hand and the ends of his feet			1
a blog post by amateur pilot and journalist @entity16 revealed this week that the former @entity18 anchor was also the victim of a medical condition that required amputation			1
@entity16 lost his left arm , sending concern throughout the online news and aviation communities			1
@entity16 , a correspondent for @entity26 " @entity25 , " appeared on @entity18 for 17 years , mostly focusing on science , technology and aerospace coverage			1
@entity4 , 30 , has an idea of what @entity16 might be going through after his amputation			1
" it 'll take some time for him to adapt , but he 'll be back in it in no time , " @entity4 said wednesday from his workplace in @entity34 , @entity35			1
former @entity18 anchor 's arm amputated after accident @entity4 had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura			1
the @entity43 describes it as a " disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding " resulting " from unusually low levels of platelets â€” the cells that help your blood clot			0
" he had been flying his father 's tiny @entity54 single - engine plane for about a decade when one day he fell into a coma and was rushed to a hospital			0
when he awoke , doctors told @entity4 he would probably face amputations			1
thus began a battle against the disorder and against depression , which he won thanks to encouragement from his family			0
@entity4 then started his journey back to the cockpit			1
first , @entity4 had to get a health evaluation			1
the @entity69 requires all pilots to be medically fit before they can be certified to fly solo			1
" they see if you 're able to meet the regulations performance-wise , even though you have a physical deficiency , " @entity4 said			1
he sent his medical records to be reviewed by an aviation medical examiner , who recommended that the @entity69 allow him to take a medical flight evaluation test			0
only 18 months after his amputations and rehabilitation , @entity4 was finally sitting in the pilot 's seat of a tiny rented airplane with an instructor , ready to show what he could still accomplish			1
" i was a little nervous , because i was having trouble getting the airplane started , " @entity4 laughed			1
" it was giving me fits			0
" eventually , the engine revved to life , and they were airborne			0
the instructor was mostly interested in judging @entity4 ' access to the plane 's instruments and how well he could control the plane			1
@entity4 practiced several takeoffs and landings and checked his braking			1
after the test , the instructor handed @entity4 his paperwork			2
" and i was a pilot again ! " he recalled			0
" it was just a huge sigh of relief , because i was n't sure what to expect			0
" he celebrated by , what else , taking a solo flight			2
the same day he passed his test , @entity4 was soaring high above @entity35 after dark			2
" it was crystal clear , " he said			0
" you could see a golden trail of headlights down the interstate			0
" " i ca n't believe i got here , " he thought			0
" it made me feel so successful , like , ' well what 's my next challenge ? ' " thankfully , @entity4 ' remaining hand -- his left -- was the one he most relied on to fly before the surgery			1
he has always used his left hand to control his steering wheel , aka " the stick			2
" @entity4 uses his prosthetic arm and hook , which now substitute for his right hand , to control the plane 's engine , or throttle			1
" the hook does n't do a whole lot			0
it just pushes and pulls on the throttle , " @entity4 said			2
" the left hand is where the magic is			2
that 's where you need all the fine motor skills , is running the stick			0
" @entity4 said that for a pilot missing the " magic hand " -- the main steering hand -- " it would be considerably more challenging to get back into it			1
but it would n't be insurmountable			0
it just takes more practice , i would say			0
" as for the aircraft 's pedals , which control the rudder , @entity4 said he does n't use any special gear			2
" it 's harder for me than it used to be to feel where the rudder pedals are , because i do n't have any toes			0
the whole front half of my feet are gone			2
" if it 's really windy and gusty , " it makes it more of a big deal , " he said			0
" the taxiing , takeoff and landing portion , that 's really the most critical time to have your game on			2
" during his career covering aviation , @entity16 developed a reputation as a pilot and aircraft owner			2
he often used his plane to travel to story assignments and as a platform to explain aviation stories to a wider audience			0
the aviation community is tight - knit , and @entity4 is reaching out to @entity16 as he would for any fellow pilot			1
" i 'd be more than happy to help him any way i can , " he said			0
the horizon looks bright for @entity4 , who 's been an aviation mechanic in @entity34 for about eight years and now flies about once a week			1
he has co-written a book about his experience , " @entity188			0
" and soon he wants to fly across @entity189 to inspire other amputees			2
" i 'm still trying to figure out where to go , " he said			0
but one idea is @entity193 in @entity194 , to help some of the nation 's troops who 've lost limbs in combat			0
" that seems like it would be a pretty cool place to go			0

amputees can be certified to fly solo as pilots
@entity4 lost his feet and right hand and still flies once a week
@entity4 said former @entity18 anchor @entity16 could be back piloting " in no time "
@entity16 posted on his blog that his left arm was amputated after an accident
