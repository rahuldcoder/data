@entity0 -- the mantra of this week 's @entity3 , the annual @entity5 event celebrating the world 's latest and greatest consumer electronic hardware , is " innovation			1
" @entity3 has even officially renamed itself as an " innovation event " with its long time ceo , @entity10 , launching a new book at the show this year suitably entitled " @entity13 : the @entity15 's @entity14			1
" but the irony of @entity3 is that there 's hardly any real innovation among all the often identical - looking new cellphones , televisions and connected devices on show in @entity5 this week			1
sadly , this 20th century style " innovation event , " with top - down structure and centralized marketing message , has little 21st century innovation			1

the real innovators today are thus the software engineers , the genuine ninjas , those " hackers " on the edge of the network who can quickly make and break any new electronic gadget			0
as @entity47 , the co-founder of @entity48 and now one of @entity51 's most illustrious venture capitalists , said , software is " eating " the world			0
it certainly seems to be gobbling down @entity3			2

@entity62 , the president and ceo of @entity65 , one of the world 's most successful businesses in the global telecommunications industry since the late 19th century , told me this week : " if we do n't innovate , we lose leadership			2
" so how to find real innovation in @entity5 this week ? like today 's digital economy , the most innovative stuff can be found away from the center			1
@entity3 's real edge is thus at its edge -- away from its 3,250 exhibitors displaying their 20,000 finished new products across 1.9 million net square feet of exhibit space			2
away from the row upon row of identical high - definition televisions			0
away from all those " breakthrough " cellphones boasting half an inch of extra screen space			0
photos : new gadgets unveiled at @entity3 yes , @entity3 's real edge is at its edge			2
so the most innovative stuff i saw in @entity5 this week were at a " hackathon " at @entity5 ' @entity93 , a couple of miles from the main convention hall			1
organized by @entity97 , the old @entity99 teleco that is now reinventing itself as open - source technology company , and sponsored by @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity65 , this hackathon ( where , full disclosure , i was an unpaid official judge ) invited software programmers to leverage @entity97 's data network to innovate new electronic products			0
more than 70 teams -- a record for an @entity97 hackathon - entered the 24 - hour competition to come up with new hardware and software products			0
from the reinvention of the car control system , to handless driving apps to a @entity123 style audio app to text - to - speech and speech - to - text applications , the @entity97 hackathon was a true innovation event -- and a splendid contrast to the all - too - often sterile atmosphere on the @entity3 floor			1

an @entity135 immigrant to the @entity136 with a phd in neuroscience from @entity140 university , @entity133 -- who had never built any software before -- drove to @entity5 from his home in @entity144 to network at @entity3			1
he happened upon the @entity145 and , on a whim , entered the hackathon			0
a sleepless 24 hours later , @entity133 hacked into a pair of electronic cat 's ears to come up with a cellphone app. these brainwave neurowear " @entity153 " ears pick up our mood and @entity133 hacked them so they could communicate with our cellphone			0
if we are too stressed , the electronic ears stop the phone either taking or making calls			0

not bad for a day 's work by a guy who had never programmed any software before in his life and who entered the @entity97 hackathon by chance			0
now that 's ninja innovation			0
and it 's the killer strategy @entity3 needs to capture if the show is to remain a successful business in a world being eaten by software innovators like @entity133			1
watch : @entity3 ingenious innovation the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

the @entity3 is under way this week in @entity5
