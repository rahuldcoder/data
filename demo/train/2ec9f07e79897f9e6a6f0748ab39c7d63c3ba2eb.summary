-- the annual report of national college rankings published by @entity3 is , regrettably , one of the most powerful forces in @entity7 higher education			1
i say " regrettably " because the list of rankings , although comprising data , surveys and statistics , does n't even begin to express the quality , comprehensiveness and special character of the more than 4,000 colleges and universities in the country			1
the report is so powerful that an administrator at @entity22 , a small , elite liberal arts school in @entity23 , submitted inflated data in order to enhance the college 's standing			1
is anyone surprised by this revelation ? just as athletes use steroids and gambling happens at @entity33 's , colleges and universities succumb to their own set of pressures , including the desire to be on top in the rankings			1
@entity3 has been highly successful at inducing far too many high school students and their families to think that there are only a handful of colleges worth attending in the entire country , and by extension saying that if a student does n't get into one of the ' select ' few , then life will never be worth living			1
attending a @entity53 school does n't make you a @entity53 person , nor does enrolling at @entity56 make you a prince			1
ironically , we know from a survey of human resource managers ( these are the people who actually hire college graduates ) that the colleges they recruit from most enthusiastically are not necessarily the same as the ones @entity7 news implies students should strive to enter			1
a college degree has become a 21st - century economic necessity			1
getting into the " best " college is a national obsession			1
many believe it 's a passport to a golden future			2
let 's play a numbers game : 100 high school seniors each apply to 10 colleges ; 1,000 applications are now in play			2
each college hopes to enroll 10 students ; 100 freshman spots are in the air			2
all of the 100 students will have a place to go to college but not every one will get into his or her first choice , nor will every college get its highest - ranked applicant			2
students strive to make themselves extremely attractive to specific colleges , and colleges work hard to make themselves more appealing to specific students			0
to stand out from the crowd of applicants , students try to game the system			0
they take prep courses to improve their sat scores ; enroll in " easy " classes to get higher grades ; search out exotic internships ; and play sports or music , or master additional foreign languages -- not because they necessarily want to but because they believe they have to in order to look outstanding			2
this is an unfortunate outgrowth of an overwrought system			0
and it should not be surprising to learn that schools also game the system by slicing and dicing their numbers in a fashion that makes them appear more appealing in one or more @entity3 category , and thus more attractive to potential students and their families			0
but gaming the system and providing enhanced data are two entirely different things			2
the first is , as i said before , regrettable , and the later -- providing inflated information -- is " extremely regrettable			2
" my mother would call it lying			0
@entity7 love lists and rankings			1
and if a person can start out at the top , then all the better			0
for many people , scarcity breeds adoration : everyone wants to go to @entity135 because not everyone can go to @entity135 ( nor should they )			0
as @entity139 season comes to a close , we will sneak up on @entity141			0
there is an inexplicable correlation between the @entity145 participants and increases in applications to those four schools			0
this is parallel to product placement in tv shows or movies			0
see @entity155 drive an @entity156 and perhaps you 'll come in to the showroom for a test drive			0
see @entity160 play basketball and perhaps you 'll come to campus to meet coach @entity163 the rankings are n't going away			1
@entity3 has a highly profitable mare in its stable : the rankings are about making money			0
the business of @entity3 is to sell magazines -- online and in print			0
it is secondly about mission : providing consumers with a public service product in return for money			0
colleges must do a better job of educating applicants to the limits ( and some values ) of the rankings " racket			0
" the public must remember that there is no ' best ' college for any one student			1
after an hour 's conversation , i 'll give a student a list of 20 schools where he or she will ( a ) get an excellent education ( b ) have a wonderful time ( c ) be able to afford the tuition , and ( d ) graduate			1
and i 'm pretty sure my list of 20 and @entity7 news ' list of 20 are not necessarily the same			1
is vichyssoise better than chicken soup with matzoh balls or just more satisfying to some people than to others ? frequently , it 's a matter of taste more than nutrition			0
follow @entity210 on @entity211 join the conversation on @entity213 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity216 : @entity219 's college rankings are powerful
one college submitted inflated data in order to enhance standing
@entity216 : @entity7 love rankings ; these are n't going away
he notes there is no ' best ' college for any one student
