-- we are the most narcissistic generation in @entity4 history			1
and when i say " generation " -- i 'm not pointing my finger at millennials , gen x / @entity9 , or baby boomers			1
the generation i speak of is defined by people who use social media to incessantly share information about their favorite topic : themselves			1
i , too , am part of this " selfie generation			2
" ( and if you do n't know what " selfie " means , you 're not			0
) we knew " selfie " had become emblematic of who we are when the @entity23 recently named it as 2013 's word of the year			0
" @entity27 ? " you say			0
" what can you mean ? " well , the new craze of " funeral selfies " is a clue : people snap a self - portrait in front of the body at a wake and share it on social media			1
for some , these selfies may actually be a way of grieving , but for others , it 's clearly about drawing attention to themselvesâ € ” even away from the recently deceased			2
selfies are but the tip of the iceberg for my " selfie - centered " generation			1
we have already seen how @entity50 has allowed so many , including myself , to tweet their most inane thoughts : a shared delusion that everything we say is so interesting / compelling / funny that it must be immediately offered to the world			1
and , of course , @entity55 , the granddaddy of social media , is a great way to share every mundane event in your life			1
we 've all read @entity55 status updates like : " i 'm eating potato chips " or " have to use bathroom , be back soon			2
" now there 's also photobombing , where people sneak into the background of a photo being taken of someone else right before it 's snapped			0
just last week , actor @entity73 ( allegedly ) photobombed a couple taking wedding photos			0
he promptly tweeted this , causing the photo to go viral			0
and i say @entity73 " allegedly " photobombed the couple because there are now apps that enable you to photobomb yourself into any picture			0
some of these pictures can truly be funny , but there 's no denying that many photobomb because they want to upstage the photo 's intended subjects -- another example of our desperate , never - ending need for attention			1
to be clear , i 'm in no way judging others in in my " selfie generation , " although funeral selfies are kinda creepy			1
sharing our thoughts and experiences on social media is now part of our @entity103 , a reflex action without a second thought			1
most of us are aware of our collective self - centeredness			1
in fact , when i was contemplating writing this article , i tweeted out the question : " are we the most self - absorbed generation ? " the response was overwhelmingly : " yes			2
" but i did hear this defense often : if the generations before us had access to the same technology we do , they would have acted just like us			0
hard to argue with that			0
why would n't @entity118 have taken a selfie after he stepped onto the moon with the @entity121 positioned behind him ? ( which would 've been one of the greatest selfies ever			2
) are you saying no one would have photobombed pictures taken at @entity128 or at anti-vietnam war rallies ? or that @entity130 would n't have tweeted photos of himself wearing a new sequin - studded jumpsuit that would have quickly gone viral ? this is who we are and there 's no chance of going back			2
in fact , future technological advancements will undoubtedly make it even easier for us to share information about ourselves in ways we ca n't imagine now			0
but the legacy of our " selfie generation " must be more than just photobombing a friend 's picture or gloating when one of our tweets is retweeted to infinity			0
our generation has an opportunity with these social media platforms to raise awareness about issues we personally believe need to be addressed			1
it can be as simple as taking a selfie as you walk past a soup kitchenâ € ” or better yet , help out in one -- and sharing it on social media			1
maybe that will inspire others to volunteer at one or at least make a donation			0
why not use a photobomb app to insert yourself into an image of an impoverished child to bring attention to the 16 million children in the @entity4 who live below the poverty line ? or tweet a photo of a @entity4 military veteran to raise awareness about the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day or the wounded veterans who still need our support			1
the list of issues , from countering domestic violence to the bloodshed in @entity184 , goes on and on			0
let 's use our love for sharing information about ourselves to also share information about the issues for which we feel passionate concern , especially during this holiday season			0
ok , be self - absorbed , but be self - absorbed for a cause			0
to me , that 's the good kind of self - centered			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 : the social media generation is the most narcissistic generation
he says new example is " funeral selfies " -- posing with dead person -- to draw attention
@entity50 , @entity55 have long allowed this self - centeredness . why not turn it to good cause ?
@entity197 : @entity212 to raise awareness of causes you care about : a good self - centeredness
