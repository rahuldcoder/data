check in : it always had the million - dollar spot on a solitary rocky point above the waves , and its rugged lodge look and soaring lounge have n't changed			1

private decks are perfect for whale - watching and sharing a @entity280			1
from $ 169 explore : pull off at @entity281 to ramble by wild - colored succulents and alien rock formations carved by the sea			2
$ 7 per vehicle -- @entity286 @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity10 the small surf town of @entity288 has remained miraculously immune to over-development for decades , despite its great wines to the east and white sandy beaches to the west			0
the elaborate breakfast ( included ! ) is nearly as good as chef @entity297 's seasonally inspired dinner ( if it 's on the evening menu , the oxtail soup is a must )			0
but the best part about the @entity302 ? that would be twin sisters @entity305 ( the innkeeper ) and @entity307 ( groundskeeper ) , who manage the organic garden and the five impeccably turned - out guestrooms			2

check in : yes , kids love the pool , the giant chess game , even the putt - putt golf green , but lush landscaping , a location to die for ( the motel is maybe 10 steps from the beach ) , and 54 large guest suites with low - key nautical decor and mini kitchens make the grown - ups giddy too			0
from $ 229 explore : @entity319 is tailor - made for strolling around in your flip - flops eating ice cream			0
