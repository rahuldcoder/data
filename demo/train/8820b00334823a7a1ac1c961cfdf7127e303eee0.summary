-- people like to say history repeats itself , but @entity3 , which is building the first @entity5 nuclear reactors approved in decades , is hoping this is n't true			1
with last year 's tsunami - induced disaster at the @entity9 plant in @entity10 , @entity6 does n't want its reactors to meet the same fate			1
" we learned a lot from @entity9 , and all that has been taken into account , " said @entity13 , general manager of @entity15 - based utility , one of the largest electricity distributors in the @entity5			1
" our uncompromising focus is safety and quality			0
" during october 's annual @entity25 - @entity15 2012 conference , @entity23 explained how the newly designed @entity27 nuclear reactors at @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 , will feature safety measures meant to prevent a @entity9 sequel			1
they include the reactors ' not needing electrical power to shut down safely and relying less on pumps and valves and more on natural heat			2
also , because of digital operation , a human controller wo n't be required for 72 hours , and the main core will remain cool because of a containment cooling system			0
these design changes , @entity23 said , are meant to protect employees and the surrounding community in the event of a natural disaster			0
@entity23 noted that while @entity6 keeps safety atop its list of priorities , it ca n't " control the weather , " and it 's hard to prepare for natural disasters such as the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity10 or 2005 's @entity56 on the @entity57			0
according to @entity63 , @entity6 's nuclear engineering programs manager , tests involving floods , earthquakes , fires and tsunamis were conducted in hopes of ensuring a natural disaster would n't affect the reactors			1
yet while @entity6 moves forward , last year 's disaster has soured the prospects for nuclear energy in some @entity73 nations , while critics ask why more is n't being done to tap safer energy such as natural gas			1
on march 11 , 2011 , a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake , the fourth - largest on record , struck off the coast of @entity80 , @entity10			0
it triggered a tsunami with 30 - foot waves that later forced the shutdown of eight reactors at two plants in @entity9			2
the next day , a nuclear emergency was declared at the @entity9 and @entity89 plants after the tsunami cut off electricity and disabled the backup generators at the former while causing the cooling systems to fail at the latter			2
@entity95 , a @entity96 spokesman , said the agency is taking a number of actions in response to @entity9			1
they involve equipment , training , procedures , maintenance and fire protection , he said			0
" the @entity28 reactors are an advanced design that has more passive safety features , " @entity107 said			0
" the @entity96 does not allow a plant to operate if it does not meet the agency 's stringent safety regulations			2
" according to the @entity96 website , on march 12 , the commission passed regulatory requirements for nuclear plants in response to @entity9			1
those requirements include mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events that result in a loss of power at the plant , steps to ensure the safety and reliability of venting systems designed to release pressure and the enhancement of spent fuel pools			2
also , the @entity96 created the @entity130 , a group that focuses exclusively on implementing regulations based on the lessons learned at @entity9			1
@entity134 , a senior scientist for the watchdog @entity135 , is n't for or against the new reactors , he said , but he expressed concerns with the tests and safety features			0
" in my judgment , the @entity27 design does not have any safety advantages compared to currently operating reactors and , in fact , may be less safe , " @entity134 said			0
" the features described are only designed to function in the event of [ a ] so - called ' design basis accident ' -- not the type of severe accident that occurred at @entity9			2
" at @entity9 , there was a total loss of power for nearly 10 days , so even if the reactors had been @entity155 , they would have run into trouble after 72 hours , @entity134 said			2
in addition , the @entity96 has exempted the @entity27 from some of the modifications it is requiring at operating nuclear reactors after @entity9 , he added			1
he said he is n't familiar with the @entity96 natural disaster tests , but " certain components of the @entity27 shield building were tested for their structural integrity under certain stress conditions and actually failed the tests , but the @entity96 discounted the results because it claimed that those components did n't need to pass those tests			2
" in a may 2011 @entity173 report , @entity96 chairman @entity171 said the shield building 's design numbers seemed off			2
@entity171 , who stepped down as chairman in july , said the company had not tested the buildings under enough possible seismic activity situations			0
however , the five - member @entity96 voted in favor of the licenses four to one , with @entity171 being the lone vote against it			2
@entity171 said he would n't speak on record to @entity0 , but he told @entity184 on february 9 that the new licenses do n't go far enough in requiring the builders to incorporate lessons learned from @entity9			1
@entity107 explained there were many versions of the @entity27 design that raised questions among critics during its creation			0
the shield building was a major area of concern but was fixed before the final design was approved , he said			0
a total of 19 changes have been submitted since the design began in 2002 , the last of which came in june 2011 , according to the @entity96 website			0
asked about @entity134 's assertion that the @entity28 plants would incur problems if they went 10 days without power , as did the reactors at @entity9 , @entity107 said all plants have some sort of backup generator that allows power to be generated in an emergency -- even one as big @entity9			2
" we have a task force specifically designed to find out what kind of backup generators will work best in these situations , " he said			0
along with the safety concerns , critics have other questions about the reactors			0
for one : why build new reactors when there are cheaper energy sources , namely natural gas ? @entity134 is one of those critics , and he points to the $ 14 billion price tag for the two reactors , which some estimates indicate may be $ 1 billion short of the actual cost			1
" the enormous price tag of new nuclear power projects , such as @entity233 and 4 , means that nuclear power is not cost - effective , especially given the low price of natural gas , " @entity134 said			1
according to the @entity241 website , new low - cost drilling technologies , growing production and an increase in reserves have made natural gas a primary source for energy , rivaling coal for the first time in april			1
before the @entity5 approved plans for 13 nuclear reactors this year , the last nuclear reactor was built in 1990			1
@entity23 downplayed the natural gas argument during the @entity25 - @entity15 conference			1
while it is " the right choice of energy in terms of cost " right now , she said it has been volatile lately and that using nuclear energy is a better option as a long - lasting energy source			1
the @entity241 states that prices for 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas , a standard measure , have fluctuated greatly of late , from $ 9.84 in december 2011 to $ 15.94 in august			1
plant vogtle has had two nuclear reactors in operation since 1989			1
unit 3 is scheduled to be in operation by 2016 , and @entity268 is scheduled to be operational a year later			0
@entity28 's were the first reactors to be approved since 1978 , the year before @entity5 witnessed its most serious nuclear plant meltdown			1
on march 28 , 1979 , a unit at the @entity274 nuclear power plant experienced a combination of equipment malfunctions , design - related problems and worker errors that led to a partial meltdown of the unit 's reactor core			0
it took nearly 15 years to clean up the damage			0
though no deaths or injuries occurred to plant workers or people in the nearby community of @entity290 , @entity291 , the @entity274 accident brought about numerous safety changes in the nuclear plant industry that still resonate today			0
likewise , other countries have n't taken the events at @entity9 lightly either , and much like @entity274 gave the world pause in its nuclear ambitions , @entity9 is prompting changes around the globe			1
for instance , @entity300 and @entity301 have decided to get out of nuclear power entirely			0
@entity304 had been planning to start using nuclear power but decided not to , said @entity307 spokeswoman @entity306			0
" we have conducted a reassessment of all existing nuclear reactors in the @entity311 in the light of @entity9			1
we hope that the results and the recommendations made will be included when building new reactors , " @entity306 said			0
" building on these results , we will come out with a new @entity311 law on nuclear safety			0

the two new nuclear reactors are the first to be approved by the @entity96 since 1978
@entity96 group focuses on implementing regulations based on lessons learned at @entity9
critics say natural gas is cheaper ; so why use nuclear energy ?
because of the events at @entity9 , other countries have stopped using nuclear energy .
