an @entity1 businesswoman has accused @entity3 presidential hopeful @entity2 of having had an affair with her that lasted nearly 14 years , a claim the candidate flatly denied monday			1
" i was aware that he was married , and i was also aware that i was involved in a very inappropriate situation -- relationship , " @entity7 told @entity1 television station @entity8			1
@entity7 also confirmed to @entity12 affiliate @entity11 that she had a sexual relationship with @entity2 , countering @entity2 's claims that the relationship was just a friendship " absolutely , " @entity7 said when asked by the affiliate if the relationship was sexual			1
" i ca n't imagine him confirming			2
it 's the name of the game i guess			2
" @entity7 told @entity8 the affair ended about eight months ago , as @entity2 prepared to announce his presidential bid			1
but she pointed to mobile - phone records she said showed @entity2 was calling her as late as september , including one as early as 4:26 a.m. @entity8 said that when it sent a text message to the number she identified as @entity2 's , the candidate called back and acknowledged he knew @entity7 but had been trying to help her financially			1
@entity2 , who lives in suburban @entity1 , upstaged the report by going on @entity12 a few minutes before the station broadcast its interview with @entity7			1
he told @entity12 's @entity27 on " @entity28 " that her assertion was coming and would be false			0
" it is someone that i know who is an acquaintance that i thought was a friend , " @entity2 said			1
but he added , " i did not have an affair			2
" " i acknowledge that i knew the woman , " he said			2
" i acknowledge that i have known her for about that period of time			0
but the accusation that i had a 13 - year affair with her , no. " he said his wife 's immediate reaction upon hearing of the accusation was , " here we go again			2
" and he said he had no plans to drop out of the race -- " not as long as my wife is behind me and as long as my wife believes i should stay in this race			0
" in a written statement issued after the interview aired , he said , " i will not fight false claims as it is not what @entity56 needs or wants			0
" " the @entity56 public is tired of dirty politics and smear tactics as evident of their tremendous outpouring of support for me , my family and my campaign this past month , " he said			0
" i am running for @entity65 , and the reality is that there are individuals out there that favor the status quo of higher taxes , more government and political cronyism and they are afraid of a @entity2 presidency			1
" @entity7 's emergence comes after two other women came forward in early november to accuse @entity2 of sexually harassing them while he was head of the @entity78 in the 1990s			1
@entity2 has denied all accusations against him , but he has slipped in published polls since the allegations first surfaced			1
@entity7 said she was never harassed or poorly treated by @entity2 , whom she described as " very much confident , and very much sure of himself , very arrogant -- in a playful , sometimes , way			1
" she said he took her to luxury hotels and flew her to cities where he had speaking engagements			0
" he made it very intriguing , " @entity7 said in the interview			0
it was something that took me away from my sort - of humdrum life at the time , and it was exciting			0
" in a statement to @entity8 , @entity2 attorney @entity95 said reporters had no business asking about the allegation			1
" this is not an accusation of harassment in the workplace -- this is not an accusation of an assault -- which are subject matters of legitimate inquiry to a political candidate , " he said			0
" rather , this appears to be an accusation of private , alleged consensual conduct between adults -- a subject matter which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public			0
" no individual , whether a private citizen , a candidate for public office or a public official , should be questioned about his or her private sexual life , " @entity95 said			2
" the public 's right to know and the media 's right to report has boundaries and most certainly those boundaries end outside of one 's bedroom door			0
" he did not address @entity7 's assertion directly , and said @entity2 " has no obligation to discuss these types of accusations publicly with the media			1
" some things are fair game , and some are n't , " @entity95 told @entity12 in a telephone interview , adding that this was one that was off - limits			1
" you 've got to draw the line somewhere			0
" @entity7 told @entity8 that she was a reluctant accuser who decided to go public only after her name was circulated among reporters			2
but she also said she was upset by @entity2 's responses to the sexual harassment allegations from two women who have been identified publicly			1
" it bothered me that they were being demonized , sort of , or were being treated as if they were automatically lying and the burden of proof is on them , " @entity7 said			0
@entity8 said it and other news organizations had received a tip from someone who knew @entity7 , alleging she had had an affair with @entity2			1
" i wanted to come out and give my side before it was thrown out there and made to be something , you know , filthy , which some people will look at this and say , that 's exactly what it is , " @entity7 told the station			2
she said their on - again , off - again relationship allegedly began in @entity173 , @entity174 , in the late 1990s , when @entity2 gave a @entity78 presentation to a group that included @entity7			1
afterward , the two shared drinks and @entity2 invited her back to his hotel room , where he pulled out a calendar and invited her to meet him in @entity180 , @entity181 , she said			1
@entity8 said @entity7 's work history includes a 2001 sexual harassment claim against an employer that was settled , a 23 - year - old bankruptcy in @entity174 and several evictions over the past six years			2
a former business partner accused her of stalking her with repeated e-mails and texts in a case that was ultimately dismissed , followed by a libel suit @entity7 lost because she failed to respond to it , @entity8 said			0
but @entity7 's attorney , @entity193 , told @entity12 's " @entity198 " that his client has no apparent financial motive for making the accusation and " everything to lose			0
" " to tell you candidly , i do n't know if she is employed or not , because she was kind of on the ropes because of all this stuff , " @entity193 said			0
" the media called her employer before this story came out , and it made it very difficult for her in the workplace			0
" and prominent feminist attorney @entity207 , who represents one of the women who accused @entity2 of harassing them , said @entity7 's financial troubles mean " zero , zip , nada			2
" " there are millions of women in this country and millions of men as well having financial problems , " she told @entity12 's " @entity218			0
" " the fact that she 's had them in the past does not bear on whether or not she 's credible on this issue			0
