@entity0 has more than just a couple of @entity2 to add to his resume			0
his movie " @entity11 , " about the suspenseful rescue of @entity8 diplomats during the @entity10 hostage crisis , has also achieved the unusual honor of prompting @entity13 to produce its own cinematic response			1
opinion : @entity16 should have played lead in ' @entity11 ' " @entity11 " was named best drama movie during the @entity2 ceremony on sunday night in @entity20 , and @entity0 won the award for best director , a category for which he was passed over in the recent @entity25 nominations			0
but his efforts to recreate on screen the drama of the secret operation by the @entity30 and @entity31 to extract six @entity8 embassy workers from revolutionary @entity10 in 1980 have n't been overlooked by @entity13 's @entity33			1
' @entity11 ' recognizes forgotten heroes of @entity10 hostage saga it plans to fund a movie entitled " the general staff , " about 20 @entity8 hostages who were handed over to the @entity8 by @entity10 revolutionaries , according to a report last week by @entity41 , the official @entity10 agency			1
" this film , which will be a big production , should be an appropriate response to the ahistoric film ' @entity11 , ' " said @entity42 , the director of the @entity10 film , according to @entity41 " @entity11 " claims to be based on a true story rather than to constitute a scrupulous retelling of exactly what took place , and its deviations from reality have been documented			2
