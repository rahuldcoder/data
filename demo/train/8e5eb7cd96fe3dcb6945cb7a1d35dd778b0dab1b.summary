@entity15 is accused of raping @entity40 , and prosecutors have charged @entity42 , who will be tried separately , with sexually assaulting @entity24 's 11 - year - old daughter			1
july 22 , 2007 , began with @entity24 , his wife and @entity31 attending church , @entity24 testified tuesday			1
@entity30 was just returning home that day from a weekend visiting with friends			1
@entity24 then played golf with his father while the girls went to the beach			1
the plan , @entity24 said , was for @entity31 to help her mother cook dinner that night			1
" @entity31 loved to cook , " said @entity24 , who was wearing a heart - shaped @entity56 pin on his lapel			1
the family finished dinner and the girls settled into the family room to watch " @entity63 " ; @entity24 fell asleep in the sun room while reading the sunday paper , he said			1
the next thing he remembers , he said , was " thinking or feeling ' ow , ow , ow ! ' " as blood ran from a gash on his head			0
" i sort of awoke in a daze			0
... the next thing i knew i was seated on the middle of the sofa , with my head down ( and ) there was something warm running down the side of my face , " he testified			2
" i saw two people standing in front of the sofa , one in front and one slightly to the rear ... and the one in the rear holding a gun , down and to his side			0
" while @entity24 said he could not clearly see the gun , he could see its form and shape , adding that " it appeared to resemble a 9 mm semiautomatic gun			1
" prosecutor @entity93 produced a gun as evidence and @entity24 confirmed " that gun is consistent with the shape of the gun i saw			1
" @entity24 testified that the suspects told him to lie down on the couch " and tied my hands at the wrists and my feet at the ankles " and covered his head with an unidentifiable piece of fabric			1
" i heard one of them say , ' if he moves , put two bullets into him , " he added			0
eventually , the suspects led him , with his head still covered , to the basement			0
" i heard nothing from @entity115 , @entity30 or @entity31			0
... i did not know where they were in the house , for the most part , " he said			0
once he was taken to the basement , @entity24 was bound to a support pole by a rope around his chest and waist , his hands still bound with plastic zip ties			1
" i would sort of go in and out of it , and slide down the pole , " he testified			2
" my body weight sliding down made my body feel better			0
... eventually i was able to get the rope on my hands untied , and break the plastic			0
but i was not able to undo my feet			0
" @entity24 recalled that earlier in the ordeal , one of the suspects asked where the family kept their safe			1
" i said we had no safe , " he testified , adding that " much later on , i heard @entity115 ... say that she would need to get dressed and need her checkbook or my checkbook to go to the bank			2
" a bank teller at a local @entity147 branch testified monday that @entity40 asked to withdraw $ 15,000 , telling the woman she needed the money " because she and her family were being held hostage at her house			2
" @entity24 said that for the most part " it was very quiet " while he was trapped in the basement , but at one point he heard " three loud noises , like someone was throwing 20 - or 30 - pound sacks on the living room floor			2
" " i heard moaning and the thumps , and may have yelled out ' hey ! ' " he said			0
" and a voice yelled , ' do n't worry , it 'll be all right in a couple of minutes			0
' but there was definitely a change of voice			0
" fearing for his family 's safety , @entity24 , still bound by his feet , hopped to the basement door			1
" i just thought time was of the essence , and i needed to get help , " he said , telling how he hopped up the basement stairs and headed to the house of his neighbor , @entity175			0
" i started to crawl , but that was n't very efficient , so i started to roll -- the whole time i was yelling ' @entity175 , @entity175 ! ' ... i rolled over , with my feet still tied , banging on his garage door , hoping he would hear			0
the garage door went up , and @entity175 said ' can i help you , sir ? ' , and i said ' @entity175 , it 's me , @entity188 , call 911 ! ' " @entity24 said police arrived moments after he made it to the @entity175 house			1
he said officers asked him who was in his house , and he replied , " the girls , the girls			0
" @entity24 said he recalled hearing a " whoosh " sound shortly after one of the men in the house yelled to him " do n't worry , it will all be over soon , " though he said he did not smell smoke or see flames once he was out of the house			2
after the ambulance arrived , he was taken to a hospital			0
in all , @entity24 said , he lost between five and seven pints of blood			2
prosecutors say the suspects put gasoline in several plastic gallon - size jugs found at the house -- originally filled with windshield washer fluid -- to start the fire in the home			2
the only other witness tuesday was police sgt. @entity219 , who testified that he was working at " an extra job " on the morning of the home invasion when he received word " that there was a possible home invasion / hostage situation			1
" @entity219 described seeing " activity in the driveway at one point , " and then the @entity24 's vehicle " quickly backed down the driveway			1
" the @entity231 escaped after hitting an unmarked police car and running over a stone wall			2
@entity219 identified the passenger in the vehicle as @entity15			2
the sergeant said the @entity231 took off " at a high rate of speed " and that " shortly after it disappeared , i heard a crash			2
" @entity219 said he and other officers tried to enter the home at that point , but were unable to do so because of the intense smoke , heat and fire			2
" there was so much fire and so much heat the [ window ] panes were disintegrating and falling onto the ground , " he said			0
in an odd twist tuesday afternoon , a male juror was dismissed after telling the courtroom that he 's " confused by the presentation of the state 's case , and what seems to be a lack of preparation on their part			1
" prosecutors filed a motion for his dismissal and judge @entity266 granted the motion to objections from the defense			0
in issuing his ruling , @entity270 said that the juror " is in such a state of agitation that i 'm worried about the contamination of the jury			0
... this is an extraordinary occurrence			0
