when does a romantic anniversary trip with your hubby to celebrate five years of marital bliss become an international kerfuffle , complete with calls for you to be prosecuted for treason ? well , when it 's @entity9 , where @entity10 are banned from traveling to for tourism , thanks to one of the most enduring embargoes in the history of mankind			1
yesterday , @entity17 stopped by @entity19 's " @entity18 " and confessed the outcry over her and @entity22 's trip to @entity23 was " quite shocking			1
" welcome to the land of cray cray , @entity26			0
emotions run deep , high , and very bizarre when it comes to the subject of @entity9			2
when photos of the celebrity couple strolling @entity23 were released , a political tumult of epic proportions erupted in @entity34			0
sen. @entity35 and a small band of conservative @entity38 - @entity10 politicos released a statement vociferously demanding an investigation of the trip by the president and the @entity43			1
one anti-castro activist went as far as to threaten to file a petition against the celebrity couple to be formally prosecuted			0
@entity22 and @entity17 's crime ? chilling in @entity23			1
there 's little doubt the collateral damage and suffering on both sides of the @entity52 -- families divided , innocents killed , fortunes lost -- has been profound			0
but it 's high time we stop the madness and bring sanity to this debate			2
for a long time , i 've been of the opinion that the @entity38 embargo policy in general is for @entity38 on the island and the @entity66 to resolve			1
those of us who have not suffered directly should stay out of it and let cubanos figure their way out of this mess			0
but , what happens when political views of a few trample on an entire nation ? and , what are the ramifications when these opinions border on the irrational ? the few but very influential pro-embargo lobby have put a stranglehold on a lucid discussion surrounding @entity9			2
five decades of failed policy later , our nation is being held hostage unable to have a cogent discussion on anything @entity9 - related			1
the @entity10 embargo has not and will not work			2
put in place in 1962 by president @entity91 , the policy is stuck in a time warp that has nothing to do with modern - day reality			0
the most enduring embargo in modern day history is a remnant of a @entity98 past when the @entity99 was the enemy and the world was on the brink of nuclear war			0
the thinking was that financial sanctions , which included a ban on travel by @entity10 citizens , would collapse the island economy and force people to revolt against @entity111			1
over the years , these sanctions have been eased or toughened depending on political winds			0
in 1992 , disgraced @entity115 rep. @entity114 was behind one the cruelest acts which banned , among many things , food and medicine sales to @entity9 and prevented @entity38 - @entity10 families from sending cash to their relatives			1
these were tough times and seeing many friends and families suffer because they could n't visit their elderly mothers more than once every three years , or being prevented from sending them needed supplies , was very painful			0
restrictions have eased under president @entity129 but there is still a major ban			0
it 's 2013 and we need to debate @entity38 policy earnestly			1
members of @entity137 must stop the cowardice around the issue and stop humoring the delusions of passionate folks stuck in the 1960s for political votes and favor			0
the pro-embargo folks are ignoring the policy 's epic failure and fail to recognize that @entity10 policy has played into the hands of the @entity111 brothers , who have sinisterly used it to make the case to their people that if @entity9 is starving and the island economy ca n't grow , it 's because of this @entity10 policy			1
in 1995 , i won an @entity158 for producing a show that explored the @entity38 embargo			2
what was special about the program , " @entity9 , " was that it gave an opportunity for the many different opinions in the @entity38 debate to be heard			1
the voices of everyday @entity38 families caught in the quagmire of policies that make their family members the " enemy " were allowed to surface			2
these are the folks -- cubanos to the core -- who will tell you , if they had a mic and a safe forum , that the current @entity10 policy is stupid			1
we hardly hear from these normal cubanos and for that matter , other average @entity10 on this issue			1
@entity9 policy is steeped in dysfunction on both sides			1
last week , the @entity189 denied @entity111 's niece @entity190 a visa to travel to @entity192 to receive an award for her gay activism , no reason given			2
a @entity189 official said visa applications are confidential			0
fifty - one years into the policy , another @entity111 is in power and the island is still communist			0
the @entity10 still trades with communist @entity201 despite its human rights violations			2
the @entity10 still trades with communist @entity204			2
we , the hip - hop generation , see right through the political hypocrisy and we want change			0
there are some bright lights in @entity137 giving hope			0
@entity10 rep. @entity212 held a news conference after visiting @entity9 on a three - day fact - finding trip recently			1
the @entity216 @entity215 announced that she found the island has made economic reforms and called for the @entity10 to promote these positive changes			0
@entity212 is part of a new group of audacious politicians , some from @entity34 , who are pushing to normalize relations and bring constructive dialogue with @entity9			0
@entity129 stands to make history by using his pulpit to encourage a more sensible dialogue around a @entity9 policy that has been futile			2
i doubt that he 'll step into this issue willingly			0
it will take gigantic political cojones to do so and on @entity9 , sadly , the president has n't expressed a willingness to " go there			0
" the best hope for sanity rests on the voices of reasonable @entity10 and @entity38 - @entity10 to demand change			1
real democratic progress in @entity9 will happen when the gates of travel are opened			1
you want democratic transformation in @entity9 ? there 's nothing more compelling than a bunch of celebrities sporting @entity251 bags in one hand and smoking puros in the other to inspire revolutions of capitalistic proportions .			1

@entity17 stopped by @entity18 and said the *reaction* to their trip to @entity9 was " quite shocking "
@entity262 : " it 's 2013 and we need to debate @entity38 policy earnestly "
" we hardly hear from normal cubanos and other average @entity10 on this issue "
" real democratic progress in @entity9 will happen when the gates of travel open "
