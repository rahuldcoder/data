-- rapper @entity3 walked out of a federal prison thursday to return to an @entity6 halfway house where he will spend the last 14 days of an 11 - month prison sentence for a parole violation , his lawyer said thursday			1
@entity3 was taken to the @entity10 penitentiary in @entity6 two weeks ago when @entity12 officials cut short his furlough just a day after it started because they believed he violated his furlough agreement			1
when @entity3 walked out of an @entity16 prison on august 31 , he tweeted , " the storm is over & da sun back out			2
" a cloud , however , quickly rained on the rapper 's freedom parade			1
prison documents obtained by @entity0 showed prison officials objected to his manager and a reality tv producer riding with him on a luxury bus on the trip from the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity16 , to @entity30			0
they quickly removed him from the halfway house , where he had expected to spend the last month of his sentence , and relocated him to the @entity6 prison			1
defense lawyer @entity34 pushed federal prison officials to reconsider , pointing out that the furlough agreement did not specifically state others could not ride with the popular hip - hop artist , whose real name is @entity3 " we have good reason to believe that this favorable result was reached because of the proactive and assertive approach taken to protect @entity3 's rights by providing @entity12 ( @entity12 ) officials and the media with reliable and accurate information that @entity3 did not intend to violate his transfer furlough or any other @entity12 rules en route from the prison facility in @entity16 to the halfway house in @entity6 , " @entity34 said thursday			1
it was initially believed prison officials objected to his use of a luxury tour bus for the trip from @entity16 to @entity30 , but the furlough agreement @entity3 signed specified only that he would travel in a " pov , " a privately owned vehicle			2
he will leave the halfway house and begin a yearlong probation term on september 29 , @entity34 said			1
the rapper served two stints in the @entity16 prison			2
he was there for seven months in 2009 as part of a sentence negotiated two years ago to resolve federal gun charges			0
those charges followed his attempt to buy three machine guns in the parking lot of an @entity6 grocery store			0
his latest time behind bars was triggered by his arrest , along with his wife , after a motorcycle officer stopped their car on @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , a year ago			0
a police report said suspected drugs were found in the couple 's car and they were both arrested on drug charges			0
the charge against the rapper was later dropped , but he failed a drug test given by his parole officer			0
@entity0 's @entity93 contributed to this report			0
