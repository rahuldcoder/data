over a boiling ocean of lava			1
naturally , the @entity10 stays cool as a cucumber , ready to die to save his crew -- an impeccably logical decision that also happens to be the compassionate one			2
but capt. @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , commander of the @entity18 , has other ideas			2
he 'll rescue @entity6 , even if that means violating a @entity22 rule that says the @entity18 ca n't be exposed to the planet 's uncivilized hordes			2
@entity16 , who never met a regulation he could n't trash , guides the starship up into the air and over to where his comrade is about to perish , and the white - mud - caked warriors stare at the ship as if it were a god			2
it 's a sensation that the movie transmits to the audience , since the @entity18 , emitting an awesome thrummm , never looked quite so massive or looming			1
will crowd - funding a ' @entity37 ' movie work ? four years ago , director @entity38 rebooted the " @entity41 " franchise with great swagger by treating the launch film as a unique pop culture origin story			1
the movie was all about how the @entity45 first came together , but really it was about how @entity17 and @entity7 rose up to become those superheroes of yore , @entity16 and @entity6 , by echoing the looks , voices , and personalities of @entity52 and @entity53 just enough , while still making the roles their own			1
the two actors now really have a chance to get their @entity16 and @entity6 on			1
@entity17 , with ice blue eyes and lips that dance on the edge of a smirk , does something marvelously clever : he evokes @entity52 's hamminess by underplaying it			2
and @entity7 makes the glowering , dagger - browed @entity6 almost fiercely withholding			2
" @entity1 " provides room for these actors to deepen their interplay			1
the movie has an often sinister grandeur , but the images never overpower the human ( or @entity10 ) factor			1
like @entity38 ' first " @entity41 " movie , this one is positioned as a prequel to the original tv series and subsequent films , though it also lifts ( and twists ) elements from that sacred text , 1982 's " @entity82 : the @entity82			1
" @entity16 and @entity6 , each following his own nature ( one 's a hothead , the other a detached brainiac ) , are usually at loggerheads			0
even when they wind up coming to the same conclusion they ca n't stop arguing about how they got there , and that 's part of the movie 's texture of cocky one - upmanship			1
' @entity99 ' : @entity101 review the whole @entity18 crew has become a collection of colliding egos			0
@entity106 's @entity105 , who 's in the middle of a lovers ' quarrel with @entity6 ; @entity110 as the so - stoic - he 's - cool @entity111 ; @entity113 's frantically funny and resourceful @entity112 — these characters pop out at us with a new dynamism			0
and they all confront a villain who has been brilliantly retrofitted to throw everyone , including the audience , off - guard			0
this dastardly dude is a boyish - looking terrorist named @entity123 , who starts off by striking a note of urban chaos			0
but it 's not long before he 's revealed to be — how can i say this ? — a foe familiar to @entity130 , with a concealed agenda and 70 of his comrades cryogenically frozen in photon - torpedo capsules			0
he 's played by rising @entity136 star @entity135 in a totally original way , with the physicality of a dancer and an eager , puckish sincerity that ingeniously disguises his vengeful mission			0
once @entity123 's been captured and placed in a cell , @entity16 has to listen to his own hunches about who this man is and what he wants			0
that 's the real '' darkness '' the film 's title is referring to : the place where you 're no longer certain of the right thing			0
and that 's a place of genuine excitement			0
intergalactic fashion finds " @entity1 " is a sleek , thrilling epic that 's also a triumphantly witty popcorn morality play			1
it 's everything you could want in a " @entity41 " movie			1
