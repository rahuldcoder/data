@entity0 -- call it a crisis of faith			0
a co-worker and i walked into the office break room wednesday , national @entity8 , to find a dozen or so foil - wrapped sandwiches beckoning us from the counter			1
this being @entity0 , home of @entity8 , we recognized them immediately , and a closer look at the puck - sized packages bearing the iconic scribbled red logo confirmed our suspicions -- and deepened our paranoia			1
" is this a trick ? " my co-worker asked as he stood frozen in front of the counter			0
" will someone judge me if they see me eating one ? " we had no idea where they had come from and still do n't , but our break room is often the dumping ground of leftovers from business meetings where food is served			2
i also froze in silence because i knew that the answer was yes , some would judge him , at least for the time being , while the company 's stance on same - sex marriage is in the spotlight , sparking impassioned op - eds and fiery debate on cable news networks and @entity47 across the country			2
supporters on both sides of the debate have staged demonstrations , starting with wednesday 's appreciation day and friday 's same - sex " kiss day " at @entity8 restaurants across the country			1
are you going to " kiss day " at @entity8 ? share your story with @entity59 ever since @entity61 opened the first @entity62 at a mall in suburban @entity0 in 1967 , the company has made no secret of its dedication to christian values			1
its corporate purpose is to " glorify @entity68 by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us " and " to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with @entity75 " all of its locations are closed on sunday			0
@entity8 - a controversy shines light on company 's charitable giving within this context , many @entity82 -- including residents of @entity0 , the ninth " gayest " @entity82 city in 2012 , according @entity84 magazine -- have chosen either to enjoy @entity8 's sandwich variations or to not patronize the restaurant because of its values			1
or , you might be like one of my gay friends , who would ask others to stand in line for his @entity8 lunch , lest his boyfriend find out			1
but for many , coo @entity99 's recent comment that he supports the " biblical definition of the family unit " has forced their hands , compelling them to publicly choose a side and politicize their eating habits			1
@entity8 was proposed by former @entity108 gov. @entity107 in an effort to show support for the company 's viewpoint			1
those who chose to support @entity8 on wednesday led to record - breaking sales , the company said , though it did not provide specific sales numbers			1
" @entity119 was not a company promotion ; it was initiated by others , " said @entity117 , executive vice president for marketing , in a statement thursday			0
" the @entity8 culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor , dignity and respect , regardless of their belief , race , creed , sexual orientation or gender			1
" time will tell whether @entity8 suffers any actual fallout from the controversy or if it 's just another " media - driven controversy , " as some have suggested			1
after all , @entity141 's is still going strong despite coming out in support of same - sex marriage with flavors like @entity145 - y ever after and @entity146			2
@entity147 still swear by @entity148 regardless of whether their burger comes with a large drink and a citation from a @entity153 passage			0
in the meantime , both sides have fanned the flames with high - profile demonstrations and heated rhetoric			2
others are left somewhere in the middle , still craving an original chicken sandwich but reluctant to subject themselves to the scrutiny of friends and colleagues , like my co-worker			0
@entity167 of @entity168 , @entity169 , made a point of patronizing at @entity8 on wednesday while visiting @entity0 for a conference			1
" we wanted to eat here today , especially to show support not just for christian values but for his right to express his beliefs , " @entity167 said shortly after finishing a chicken sandwich and waffle fries from a @entity8 stand in the @entity175 food court			1
she said she shared @entity183 's position on same - sex marriage , acknowledging that if the controversy centered around his support for it , she would n't have participated in appreciation day			1
normally , though , she eats at her local @entity8 at least once a week because she appreciates the food and the customer service -- not because of its christian values			1
" i 'm allowed to eat where i want , " she said			0
" we need to be appreciative that we live in a country where we can say what we want and eat where we want			0
" even some people who oppose @entity183 's views did n't feel the need to boycott the restaurant , especially if those views do n't lead to discrimination against customers or employees			1
" i do n't agree with the owners ' beliefs , but they publicly state that they will serve all who enter the door , " @entity1 commenter @entity204 said			0
" i believe in religious freedom , " the @entity212 , @entity211 , resident wrote in an e-mail			0
" because the owner 's personal opinions differ from mine points to a healthy society			2
" for many , @entity183 's views are secondary to his right express them , even among members of the @entity223 community			1
" mr. @entity61 has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he does n't support same - sex marriage , " said @entity224 , a 20 - year - old ireporter from @entity147			0
" as a gay man , i say , let him not support gays			0
when the gay community and gay activist groups push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement , i fear it would make whatever accomplishments taste cheap like a greasy coin			2
ultimately , the acceptance of the gay community and the right of gays to marry will not be achieved through violent means , physical and verbal , but through peaceful and honest negotiations			2
" how the @entity247 has evolved predictably , @entity183 's stance on same - sex marriage kept others away wednesday			2
" i think the ( @entity251 ) has made eating at @entity8 a political statement			1
i would n't ( have ) had a problem eating there before , but now that the restaurant has turned into a campaign to bash the rights of the lgbt community , i realize i can put my money somewhere else , " @entity1 commenter @entity253 said			2
" as a born - again gay @entity263 , it saddens me to see @entity263 feeding into politics			0
politics just divides people and stirs up a lot of anger			0
" as counterprotests in the form of " kiss - ins " take shape friday , some would just as soon stay away from @entity8 this week to avoid making the act of eating chicken political			1
" both sides have very good points , but both sides are also wrong , and they 're both making this into something far bigger than it needs to be , " said an @entity0 - based @entity1 commenter who preferred not to be named			2
" both sides just quite honestly need to grow up and stop acting like 2 - year - olds just because somebody said something they did n't like			0
" the @entity0 resident says she does not plan to boycott the chain altogether because she agrees with both sides			2
and she likes the food			0
plus , if you start boycotting @entity8 because you disagree with the @entity251 's views , how far will you take your principles ? " i 'm very impressed with people that try to avoid right - wing companies from profiting off of them			1
trying to avoid @entity296 products would be really hard			0
i mean , they even make asphalt ! " a friend said in response to my @entity302 question , " are you conflicted over buying @entity8 ? " " it 's not a political issue for me			1
i think it 's more of a way for people to define themselves in front of their friends , " she said			0
" it reminds me a lot of @entity315 , people getting riled up over something as a way to define themselves			0
" as for my co-worker , he quickly gobbled down his sandwich in the break room while we speculated over where they might have come from			0
he finished it before others entered the room , tsking as they pulled out their smartphones to take pictures			0
two hours later , the rest of the sandwiches were gone			0
complete coverage : @entity8 - a debate @entity1 's @entity335 contributed to this report .			1

in wake of @entity8 coo 's comment , @entity82 choose sides and politicize eating habits
others prefer to avoid controversy or *quietly* *agonize* over whether to patronize chain
many say views are secondary to the right to express them , even within @entity223 community
