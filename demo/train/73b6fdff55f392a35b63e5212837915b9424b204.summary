-- we live in an era of airline fees			1
where once ticket prices included checked baggage , inflight meals and seat selection , increasingly , those items are add - ons geared towards generating extra income for carriers			2
according to a recent survey by @entity15 , there are actually some luxuries passengers are willing to shell out for -- they 're just not always in line with what airlines actually charge			1
" overall , fees are here to stay , and as we continue to see a debundling of fares , passengers will increasingly be asked to pay for various services that previously they did n't , " says @entity26 , vice president and general manager of @entity15			1
" there 's an overall perception that consumers feel they 're being nickel and dimed , and it 's important for airlines to express what value they are presenting			0
" give passengers what they want according to @entity15 's survey , the most widespread fees are also some of the least popular			1
while @entity40 airlines collected $ 2.5 billion from checked baggage fees between january and september 2013 , 89 % of respondent said it 's important for them to be able to check their bag for free			2
also , with the exception of @entity47 , all @entity40 carriers now charge for in - flight meals on domestic flights , even though nearly half of those surveyed classified free food as an important perk			0
if airlines dropped these fees , they could recoup in other areas			0
@entity15 also found that 20 % of respondents would pay for a first class meal in coach class , a service that few carriers offer			1
" in my view , that 's something that would be a real win - win for the airlines			0
it does n't devalue first class , as people are n't just paying for the meal , but for the exclusivity , for more space , for better service and amenities			0
first - class meals would enhance the flying experience in coach without detracting from the experience in first , " he adds			1
put it in the bin cramped storage space is not only a headache for passengers , it 's poses a financial loss for carriers as well			0
while customers malaise through the aisles , holding up boarding in an attempt to fit their carry - ons on the plane , airlines are losing money ( slow boarding costs them approximately $ 10 million yearly )			0
increasingly , airlines have started charging for carry - on luggage , a fee that is , understandably , not popular with passengers			0
frequent flyers have another solution in mind			0
rather than pay to bring luggage on - board , they 'd rather spend extra for roomier overhead bins			1
of those surveyed , 42 % said this is a service they would happily splurge on			2
" no airline allows you to buy designated overhead bin space , but based on our findings , it 's definitely something they should consider , " says @entity26			0
why wi - fi ? while airlines are investing heavily in upgrading their systems to offer passengers @entity117 , many of those surveyed expressed it 's not really a feature that matters to them			0
only 30 % said they would pay extra for @entity117 , a number that surprised @entity26			1
" with large populations having their own smart phones , i would have thought they 'd want to bring their own entertainment systems on board , but that was n't something our survey found , " he says			2
a little extra for comfort as plane seats continue to shrink , it 's probably no surprise that most fliers are willing to pay for a little extra room			2
nearly 90 % of passengers said they wanted more comfortable seats , and 45 % said they 'd pay for extra legroom			1
a good chunk were willing to go even further ; 34 % of travelers would pay to prevent the seat in front of them from reclining and 26 % would pay to have an empty middle seat next to them			2
some of the perks respondents wanted would be a challenge for airlines to implement : 13 % of those polled said they 'd pay to have control of their armrests , 4 % said they 'd shell out for the right to control the window shade , and 4 % said they 'd pay to be first in line for the restrooms .			1

a @entity15 survey reveals which airline fees passengers are willing to pay for
4 % of those polled would pay to skip the line for the *bathrooms*
13 % said they 'd splurge for control of the armrest
20 % said they 'd spend extra for first class meals in coach
