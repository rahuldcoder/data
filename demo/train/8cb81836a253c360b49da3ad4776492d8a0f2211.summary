@entity1 's daily workouts could intimidate the most seasoned athlete			1
he runs , climbs , does pull - ups and push - ups , and lifts weights for nearly two hours at a time			2
but what really sets this 30 - year - old father of three apart is that he does it all with one arm and one leg			1
in the aftermath of september 11 , @entity13 felt called to serve his country			1
at 19 , he withdrew from the @entity17 at @entity18 and enlisted in the @entity19			1
" after we were attacked , i felt like it was what i needed to do			2
i quit school and started off on a new journey			2
" @entity13 was deployed to @entity25 with the 101st airborne out of @entity27 , @entity28 , in 2003			1
after becoming a husband and father , he returned for a second tour in 2005			2
" they put us in an area that was known as the triangle of death			2
it was southwest of @entity39			2
the units that had been there before us had taken a beating			2
it was just a rough area			2
" four months into his second deployment , he was trying to catch a bit of sleep between missions when his platoon leader woke him			1
" he said , ' hey , we 're gon na go take these humvees to go pick up the rest of the platoon			2
' @entity54 there 's nothing important going on			1
we 're just going to pick them up , coming back			2
@entity57 wanted you to know we 're leaving			2
" but @entity13 says he insisted on not only joining the convoy but driving the lead vehicle , a decision that put him in the path of a roadside bomb detonated by a trip wire			1
four days later , on christmas morning , @entity13 woke in @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			1
" i had no idea where i was or how i got there			0
i remember waking up and seeing my parents walking in			0
i knew i was somewhere safe because they were there , and something told me to smile because they 'd know i was ok			0
" he lost his left arm above the elbow and left leg above the knee			1
his jaw needed to be reconstructed , and his mouth was wired shut			0
his recovery was as rough emotionally as it was physically , and during it he and his wife divorced			0
" i remember thinking it was all over			0
i 'd lost two limbs , a wife			1
you know , i remember thinking i much rather had died than wake up like this , " @entity13 said			1
his attitude started to shift thanks , in part , to a fellow amputee : his father , who lost his hand at age 18 when a machine malfunction at the plant where he worked			1
" i remember there was a moment that my mom leaned in and told me while i laid in the hospital bed , and she said , ' you just had to outdo your dad and lose your arm and your leg , ' and it was that moment that i thought , ' you know , this is bad , but it could be worse			1
maybe i can do something with this			0
' " @entity13 moved back home to @entity119 , remarried and had two more children			1
he then decided it was time he got back into shape			0
he found @entity124 in @entity18			0
the gym is owned by @entity19 veteran who designs military - inspired workouts that @entity13 thrives on			1
" he 's shown great drive , and basically the goals that he sets , every time he achieves one , he sets a higher one , " @entity124 owner @entity128 said			1
@entity13 continues to push himself harder and now competes in grueling races like the @entity136 and @entity137 , in which runners tackle an obstacle course			1
he is also training to run the @entity140 in october			0
he has documented his journey through social media and garnered a legion of supporters with his story			0
" people started following me in what i was doing , sending me messages and telling me how i motivated them			0
some were people with disabilities			0
some were not , " @entity13 said			1
" i never intended that to happen			0
i was just doing something for myself			0
" seeing his recovery as an opportunity to motivate others , he joined @entity158 the nonprofit enlists people to participate in physically demanding races wearing gas masks			0
the proceeds are used to take injured veterans on morale - boosting trips			1
" it 's not that i 'm this incredible guy , but my injury was before them			1
and if i can show them the route i took to success , then they can follow the same , and that makes me feel good			0
" @entity13 is passionate about leading other veterans to recovery and showing them what they can do instead of what they ca n't , but the most important people he hopes to inspire are much closer to home			1
" i 'm showing my two sons and my daughter that no matter what happens to you in life , you can continue pushing			0
you can continue to be happy and do whatever you want to do			0
i feel like i 'm showing them what they need to do , because as a parent , you can try to preach to your children all day long			0
they do n't hear your words			0
they only see your actions			0
and i hope that i 'm showing them a healthy , happy way of leading their life			0
