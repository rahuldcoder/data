-- vice president @entity1 of @entity2 , the man set become the country 's next paramount leader , is scheduled to meet with president @entity6 and other officials on tuesday during a @entity9 visit that is likely to help burnish @entity1 's statesmanly credentials at home and abroad			1
the planned meetings have thrust @entity1 , who is expected to become head of the ruling @entity14 later this year , onto center stage in both the @entity9 and @entity2 news media			1
@entity17 undertook a similar visit 10 years ago as he was being groomed for the top job			2
but beneath the carefully choreographed presentation of the high - profile meetings lies a range of contentious issues on which @entity1 has little incentive to give ground , including trade and @entity2 's growing military presence			1
" i think he 's going to be be tough with a smile on his face , " said @entity28 , senior counselor for the communications firm @entity29 in @entity2			2
" he 's gon na appear to be a very friendly man			0
but he has to be tough because he 's still talking to an audience back here			0
" the subject of @entity1 's five - day trip and what it portends for @entity9 - @entity2 relations in the coming years has received heavy coverage in state - run media in @entity2			1
" the @entity9 has never met a competitor like @entity2 before , " the @entity42 , an english - language newspaper run by the @entity14 , said in an editorial published monday that noted @entity2 's global clout in manufacturing and exports			1
the @entity6 administration , under pressure from stubbornly high unemployment figures in an election year , has already taken steps concerning @entity2 's role in global trade			1
@entity6 mentioned @entity2 by name when he announced in his @entity56 last month that he was creating a trade enforcement unit to bring cases against other countries			2
there is also persistent tension over @entity2 's efforts to control the level of its currency , the renminbi , which @entity9 officials say make it undervalued			1
@entity1 , 58 , is very well versed in these issues , according to @entity68 , the former @entity69 presidential hopeful who was @entity9 ambassador to @entity2 between 2009 and 2011			1
" he 's gone out of his way in recent years to bone up economics and trade , knowing full well that these are the issues that are going to determine whether or not the @entity9 and @entity2 are able to get through the years to come , " @entity68 said			1
@entity2 officials are aware of @entity9 concerns , but @entity1 and other leaders face the challenge of keeping @entity2 's hundreds of millions of workers content as economic growth starts to ease from the torrid levels of recent years			1
policy makers in @entity83 are grappling with how to tackle rapidly rising prices and the widening gap between rich and poor			0
" i want a job , " said @entity86 , an unemployed welder in the coastal province of @entity88 , where @entity1 used to be governor			0
" our local economy is just bad			0
i find even a bowl of noodles too expensive here			0
" @entity1 's engagements in the @entity9 began monday with a dinner in @entity97 attended by the former @entity9 secretaries of state @entity98 and @entity100			2
he was given a less cordial welcome by activists advocating @entity104 independence who started unfurling a banner on @entity107 in @entity97 on monday afternoon			0
the activists were detained by the police before being released			0
@entity83 has been struggling in recent weeks to contain unrest among ethnic @entity104 in the southwestern province of @entity112			0
it has sent additional security forces to the region after @entity104 protesters set themselves on fire and clashed with police to express frustration with @entity2 rule			0
on tuesday , @entity1 was scheduled to meet with @entity6 , vice president @entity121 and secretary of state @entity122			1
he will also attend a round - table discussion with @entity9 and @entity2 business executives			2
after @entity97 , @entity1 will travel wednesday to @entity125 , a state he first visited as a local official in the 1980s			0
he is visiting the @entity9 amid the rhetoric and political uncertainty of presidential election campaigning			0
but upheaval is also under way in @entity2 through the leadership transition that is set to result in @entity1 's taking charge later this year			2
with about 70 % of the country 's top 200 officials expected to be swapped out during the process , @entity68 said @entity1 is " stepping into the forefront of @entity2 's political leadership structure at a time of enormous change			1

the @entity2 vice president is in the @entity9 for a five - day visit
@entity1 is expected to become @entity2 's president later this year
he is scheduled to meet with president @entity6 and other top officials
*observers* expect @entity1 to take a tough line on issues like trade
