-- from the top of a 14 - meter mast , @entity1 expertly rolls down a length of white ribbon , her taut body pirouetting mid-air , before easing into the arms of her lover			1
the two @entity11 acrobats continue to twirl and swoop , their flying silhouettes growing darker as the sun lowers in the sky behind them			1
it 's a sumptuous image that hushes the crowd who stand gathered , not under a circus big top , but on the banks of a jetty			0
this , of course is no ordinary acrobatic show , but one performed entirely on a lurching 12 - meter yacht in harbors across the world			1
" they use the whole boat like it 's one big gymnastics apparatus , " said @entity24 , manager at @entity26 's @entity25 , which recently hosted the enchanting @entity29 show			1
" you could n't ask for a more dramatic stage -- people can watch from the shore or take their own dinghy and see it from the water			1
" a family affair for acrobat couple @entity1 , 42 , and @entity43 , 44 , their distinctive yellow yacht is not simply a stage -- it 's also the floating home they share with two daughters ; @entity49 , 13 , and @entity50 , five			1
" the eldest has done some shows with us , playing a puppet , but the youngest is still too small , " said @entity43			0
" we 're home - schooling them and at the beginning of each year they go back to @entity11 to do their exams			1
" since setting sail from @entity61 in north west @entity11 in 2004 , the free - spirited family has traveled from port to port across the globe , performing their remarkable show and surviving on donations alone			1
" they just pass a hat around at the end , " @entity24 explained			0
" people ca n't believe they 're seeing this fantastic performance for free -- it really generates a sense of generosity			0
" show time from rolling down the top of the mast , to balancing on the boom , and tiptoeing along the railing , the agile acrobats leap across every inch of the boat in two very different 20 - minute routines			2
the first is a slapstick @entity87 - style comedy , featuring two bumbling sailors racing around the yacht to a lolloping piano soundtrack			2
as the sun sets , the couple perform their second , more romantic show , in which two lovers tenderly cavort mid-air to rousing classical music			2
" in the romantic show , there 's an orange - pinkish light behind them while they 're doing this beautiful ballet in the rigging , " @entity24 said			1
" they perform the whole thing without a safety net			0
it 's like nothing you 've ever seen before -- people were coming back day - after - day to see them			0
" setting sail the daring duo began taking circus lessons while university students in @entity117 , and in 1999 set up their own acrobatic company called @entity119 -- meaning " small light " in old @entity11			1
they performed in theaters and on the streets , but had dreams of taking the show on the road -- or more accurately , the high seas			0
" we both sailed with our parents when we were young , " @entity1 explained			0
" that was our dream -- to travel the world by boat			2
" in 2000 they bought a half - built yacht and spent the next four years getting it into seaworthy shape			2
once on the water , the pair spent a year experimenting and refining their unique aquatic - based act			2
" the first time we tried it , i had a lot of bruises , " @entity1 said			0
" it 's so much more complicated than working on land			0
" " you have to work with the weather , the wind , the waves -- the boat is constantly moving			0
" @entity153 the family 's nomadic lifestyle has taken them across @entity157 , @entity158 , and now @entity159 , where they 'll be performing over the next month			2
and after that , who knows ? the carefree couple tend to sail the high - seas in whichever direction they wish , surviving on around $ 800 a month			1
" they 're not living high on the hog , as they say , but they 're loving what they 're doing , " @entity24 said			0
" their perspective on life is different from people working nine to five -- they do n't know where they 're going the next day and you 've got to respect that			0
" and so , like the circus wagons of old , the family of acrobats will point their " small light " towards the horizon in search of the next high - flying adventure .			1
