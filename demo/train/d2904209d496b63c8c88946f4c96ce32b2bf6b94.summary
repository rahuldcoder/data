-- dna from a 45,000 - year - old leg bone is giving scientists a better idea of when modern humans first started mating with @entity6			1
the thigh bone was found six years ago on the banks of the @entity9 in @entity10 by @entity11 , a @entity12 artist who carves jewelry from ancient mammoth tusks , according to the journal @entity16			2
" it was quite fossilized , and the hope was that it might turn out ( to be ) old			0
we hit the jackpot , " @entity19 , a paleoanthropologist who co-led a study of the remains , told nature			0
" it was older than any other modern human yet dated			0
" 2013 : oldest human dna found in @entity28 for those who are n't familiar with our @entity31 ancestors , @entity6 are an extinct species of human who differ in @entity1 from what scientists call " modern humans " by less than 1 %			1
modern humans first left @entity40 about 60,000 years ago , according to @entity41 , and wandered toward @entity42 and @entity43			1
there , they encountered neanderthals and another species of human called @entity48			0
scientists believe @entity6 died out about 30,000 years ago , possibly because they were simply absorbed into the modern human population			2
roughly 2 % of genomes of non-africans today come from the @entity6 species , according to @entity16			1
until now , scientists had n't pinpointed exactly when @entity6 and modern humans began interbreeding			2
sequencing of the 45,000 - year - old bone 's dna showed that 2.3 % of his genome also came from @entity6 , according to a study published wednesday			1
his neanderthal dna segments were long , the scientists say , which suggests that the love fest between the two species began between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago			1
" paternal and maternal chromosomes are shuffled together in each generation , so that over time the dna segments from any individual become shorter , " nature explains			0
7,000 - year - old male , dark skin , blue eyes , likes hunting ... of course , when it comes to evolution , there 's always a debate			0
some scientists believe modern humans left @entity40 more than 100,000 years ago			1
" this is just a random find in a @entity10 river deposit , " @entity83 , a paleoanthropologist at @entity85 's @entity84 , told nature			0
" what else could be there when they start looking systematically ? "			0

scientists sequence dna of 45,000 - year - old leg bone found in @entity10
study : modern humans and @entity6 mated 50,000 to 60,000 years ago
roughly 2 % of genomes of non-africans today come from @entity6 species
