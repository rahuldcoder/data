according to court documents filed by @entity21 's defense , he had planned to use a gun that would be left hanging from a water fountain in the basement of the courthouse			1
however , an accomplice in the basement handed @entity21 a .22 - caliber gun instead as he was being led in by guards			2
@entity21 was handcuffed , and his legs chained together			2
