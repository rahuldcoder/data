-- in a recent column for the @entity3 , @entity1 argued that the nation has now entered into a " capitalism debate			2
" @entity1 wrote that president @entity6 , who he said is feeling defensive about the failure of his policies to revitalize economic growth , has launched an all - out assault on capitalism by depicting @entity12 as the embodiment of corrupt and vicious economic practices			1
the president 's decision to focus on @entity12 's work at @entity18 , @entity1 argues , has shifted the " focus of the race from being about big government , which @entity6 represents , to being about capitalism , which @entity12 represents			1
" @entity12 responded in kind , " i 'm convinced he wants @entity24 to be ashamed of success			1
" if this shift continues , the campaigns will spend the next four months presenting voters with a false impression about the the real contest			0
while both parties have a strong incentive to ramp up the rhetoric to mobilize voters to turn out , this kind of campaign features a debate that has little to do with the governing that will actually take place after the election			2
this election is not a choice between government and markets			1
the reality is that we will continue to have a system that mixes government and markets , with the political battles centering on the particular priorities that the nation emphasizes within that mix. @entity6 , as @entity1 points out , has not really been a critic of free - market capitalism			1
his policies have done little to challenge the forces of globalization , and he has worked closely with economic leaders in his efforts to fix the economy			0
his financial regulation did little to curb the freedom of @entity63 investors			0
@entity6 is not some kind of exception among @entity24 liberals			1
indeed , since @entity67 , @entity24 liberals have been firm supporters of @entity24 capitalism			1
their goals have been to tame the excesses of this economic system and to make capitalism fairer for all @entity24			1
many of @entity67 's economic policies , such as the @entity75 , depended on voluntary cooperation from big business			0
@entity67 backed away from any proposals that entailed the federal government obtaining strong control over managerial decisions			2
the point of legitimating unions , which happened through the @entity84 ( 1935 ) , was to provide workers with some kind of countervailing power to business owners within the capitalism system			2
other democrats , such as @entity91 , followed in this market - friendly liberal tradition			0
@entity93 offered economic assistance to the poor and educational assistance to all students , so that more people could participate and enjoy the fruits that the capitalist system produced			0
with his support of deregulation and deficit reduction , @entity100 moved market - based @entity90 even further to the center			0
@entity105 embraced globalization and believed that nurturing free markets could offer the best opportunities to those struggling at home and abroad			2
while liberalism has always been a political system that sought to use government to strengthen the market - based economy , conservatives have usually been comfortable with government			1
despite their rhetoric , conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of @entity24 life			1
@entity12 has been no exception			0
as governor , he was not some kind of radical slasher of government services			2
the centerpiece of his term was a bold health care initiative that expanded that role of government in ensuring access to health care			0
@entity12 cut services , but he also increased all kinds of government fees			0
during his current campaign , @entity12 is not talking about eliminating the big - ticket programs like @entity139 , and he has firmly defended robust levels of national security spending			0
like @entity6 , @entity12 reflects his own political tradition			1
@entity143 has long been dead among conservatives			0
during the @entity148 , conservatives like sen. @entity146 and author @entity147 pushed for the government to spend more on the fight against communism			1
during the 1970s , historian @entity152 recounted , many conservatives came to accept federal programs such as education as an inevitable part of domestic life			1
president @entity158 , the iconic conservative , quickly backed off proposals like an initiative to reduce certain @entity139 benefits when they stimulated a strong political backlash , and he left many other kinds of domestic spending , like @entity166 or agricultural subsidies , intact			0
@entity168 brought the federal government into new areas of domestic life , providing , for example , protections for people with disabilities			1
congressional conservatives like @entity176 proved that they were not much different , as they too were aware that @entity24 in red states often depended on the government they lambasted			1
@entity179 and the @entity180 grew government in the early part of this century			1
@entity168 pushed several significant domestic initiatives such as @entity184 and a costly prescription drug benefit			0
like all republicans , he did little to take out the massive welfare state of tax exemptions and deductions upon which many industries depend			0
in 2008 , he saved financial markets through government with @entity193 , not through deregulation			1
his homeland security program involved an aggressive expansion of government power , and he launched two wars abroad			0
like it or not , liberals have always accepted capitalism , and conservatives have proved more than willing to live with , and even to use , the federal government for certain purposes			1
the debate today is not between big government and free market capitalism but rather about how we should structure our mixture of these two systems			2
the more we have these kinds of overblown debates , the less voters get a sense of what politicians are actually about and what they 'll do once in power			0
a more realistic debate would be about which portion of the public will have tax cuts extended			0
rather than an @entity223 , we should hear which specific parts of the budget will be trimmed and where will each candidate try to find more efficiency in government			2
in terms of the economy , where and how will they use government to stimulate economic investment and to curb the deficit , how else will candidates try to raise revenue			0
this current rhetoric is not only unrealistic , it fuels public frustration with government by generating false expectations and providing campaign discussions that have little to do with real life in @entity244			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			2

*pundits* are *painting* president @entity6 as the *anti-capitalist* candidate , says @entity247
but this election is not a choice between government and markets , @entity247 says
liberals have been firm supporters of capitalism , he says
@entity247 : conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of @entity24 life
