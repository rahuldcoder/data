this should be the day @entity1 steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the @entity4 in @entity5			1
it is the first time the @entity8 country has hosted the vip event since the @entity10 - based @entity4 came to the continent nearly a quarter century ago -- but the spotlight has shifted			2
@entity13 is now on the @entity1 's list of problems in the @entity16 : kidnappings , terrorist attacks and killings			1
the country has been a terrific economic growth story for the past few years , humming along at around 7 %			1
it is at the heart of what many define as an @entity25			0
after decades of loans from international lenders such as the @entity28 , high debt and little development , @entity5 is coming alive			2
that is why @entity1 president @entity32 and his highly regarded economic team were eager to bring global ceos to their turf			1
but @entity1 does have a couple of obvious economic black - eyes , most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the @entity41 , which in turn has given fuel to the @entity45 movement and , by extension , radical @entity40			1
these groups take issue with what they see as the negative influences of globalization			0
the @entity4 is seen as standing at the forefront of a policy discussion and networking linked to more , not less , globalization			0
the best indicator for the wealth gap is per capita income			0
let 's start in the financial capital of @entity61 and work our way @entity16			2
in @entity61 , it is pegged at just over $ 2,900 , according to a survey by @entity66			0
in the political capital of @entity69 , where the economic forum is taking place , it rises to $ 4,000			0
but if one heads @entity16 to @entity72 -- the birthplace of @entity45 -- per capita income is just $ 1,631			0
there is an overemphasis on farming , very little in the way of an industrial base and the financial situation is even worse in surrounding states			0
in @entity72 , alarmingly , 60 % of the population lives in extreme poverty , according to the @entity1 @entity84			2
poverty and violence often go hand - in - hand , and that is the case here			0
nearly a third of all violent deaths in the country over the past two years have taken place in this region			0
one can not overlook the effort by the terrorist group to ramp up the heat ahead of this high - profile business forum			0
but at the same time one can not ignore the lack of progress in fighting off the violence and persistent corruption			2
this government 's track record of unleashing pent - up demand is solid			0
after re-basing its economy in early april to take in services growth , @entity1 zoomed ahead of @entity5 as the continent 's biggest economy			1
@entity1 and @entity5 are both plagued with high unemployment , but the former 's gdp now stands at over a half trillion dollars while the latter 's is at $ 325 billion			1
@entity5 also struggles with less than a third of @entity1 's growth			1
@entity5 's president @entity117 goes to the polls making the case that his country can serve as a springboard into the faster growing economies of @entity8 and @entity123 , due to its lead in financial and trade services			2
@entity1 private sector banks and telecom providers have a different view			2
@entity1 has all the ingredients for growth : 170 million people , a low debt level and low budget deficit with the blessing of sizable proven oil reserves			1
at 37 billion barrels , the country is ranked second on the continent behind @entity139			0
it is a nice recipe for growth , but the rule of law and rooting out corruption rank high on the foreign investor check list			1
that is where @entity1 remains vulnerable			1
more from @entity146 : pocketbook politics will decide @entity149 's @entity148 : my country , the schizophrenic @entity152 more : 6 reasons why the world should demand action in @entity156 : @entity1 do n't care about their ' new economy '			1

@entity1 has a nice recipe for growth , @entity159 's @entity146 writes
but he says the country remains vulnerable to violence and corruption
the rule of law rank high on the foreign investor check list , he says
