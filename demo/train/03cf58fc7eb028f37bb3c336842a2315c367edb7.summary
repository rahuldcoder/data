@entity0 -- a learjet departing @entity4 's @entity3 last month came within about two plane - lengths of striking a taxiing @entity7 @entity6 that had been cleared to cross the same runway , according to a preliminary report by the @entity10			1
the airborne @entity2 passed 62 feet above -- and within 287 feet laterally -- of the @entity7 passenger plane , according to the @entity10 , which is investigating the incident			1
according to the @entity10 , the co-pilot of the taxiing @entity7 jet saw the @entity2 and shouted " stop " to the plane 's captain , who brought the plane to a halt near the edge of the runway			1
air traffic control audio tapes , released by liveatc.net , a website for aviation enthusiasts , captured conversations between the @entity7 crew and controllers in the minutes immediately afterward			1
" ok ... you just cleared us onto a runway ( where ) there was a plane taking off , " one of the pilots said to controllers			0
" what technology clears us on the runway when a plane was taking off ? " a pilot added , sounding exasperated			0
the @entity7 crew then radioed another controller			1
" we had to hit our brakes and the thing went right over our head , " the crew said			1
according to the @entity10 's preliminary report , the incident occurred about 9 a.m. ct on december 1 , when a @entity2 was instructed to line up and wait on runway 31 right			1
@entity49 had landed on a parallel runway -- 31 center			0
as the @entity7 plane was decelerating on the center runway , the @entity2 was cleared for takeoff on the right			2
when an air traffic controller gave the @entity7 plane clearance to turn right on a taxiway that crossed the right runway , the two planes came into potential conflict			2
@entity62 , a former 737 pilot now with the non-profit @entity63 , said it is still unclear what caused the mishap , but credited the @entity7 co-pilot for averting potential disaster			2
" fortunately , the first officer was ' heads up ' in that cockpit and basically saw the @entity2 coming , and told the captain to stop , which he did just prior to entering into the active runway , " @entity62 said			0
" if that @entity2 had had any kind of a problem and not lifted off when it did -- they prevented a very serious accident , " @entity62 said			0
@entity62 said @entity3 airport is one of 35 airports equipped with an surface movement detection system known as @entity82 to detect potential runway conflicts			0
" the investigation will probably look into whether @entity82 was in operation at the time or ( whether ) the controllers using it or not using it , " he said			0
the @entity10 said the report is preliminary , and no blame has been assigned in the matter			1
no one was injured in the event			0
