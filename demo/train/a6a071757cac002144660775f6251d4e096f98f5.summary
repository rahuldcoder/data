what do you think of @entity2 ? by leaking classified documents to the media and revealing that the @entity5 has been monitoring our phone and internet usage , is he a traitor or a hero ? could he simply be a narcissist looking to get famous ? or do you not care about either him or the @entity5 surveillance programs ? @entity14 , co-host of the new @entity16 morning show , " @entity17 , " joined us to discuss the top issues in this week 's episode of " the @entity22 " podcast			1
( be sure to tune in to " @entity17 , " which premieres on monday june 17 at 6 a.m. et. ) i must note that while i disagreed with @entity14 's view on @entity2 , as a fellow graduate of @entity30 , his logic and comedy chops were impeccable			1
it 's something we share and that distinguishes me from my co-hosts @entity33 and @entity35			1
( at least that 's what i keep telling myself			0
a poll this week found that 31 % of @entity39 consider him a patriot while 23 % view him as a traitor			1
but a whopping 46 % say they do n't know			0
is it because these 46 % simply are n't following the story or because they have accepted government surveillance as the price for security ? the @entity49 : a glance at opinions about the @entity5 leaker as @entity14 pointed out , @entity39 have " matured " since 9/11 over the issue of government surveillance			2
consequently , he believes that many do accept increased monitoring if it means that we can prevent another 9/11 or @entity58			0
but to me , " we the people " have a right to know when our government is spying on us , especially when officials like @entity63 , the director of @entity64 , denied such a program existed when asked about it under oath by @entity68 just a few months ago			0
how else can we hold our government accountable if we are n't informed of its actions ? to listen to this week 's podcast , click on the @entity73 audio player on this page or find us on @entity75			1
the second issue we discuss this week will hopefully outrage and disgust you as much as it did us			0
there are few things that unite the left and right in @entity39 ( or @entity33 , @entity35 and i for that matter ) but charities taking advantage of the sympathy and good will of @entity39 did just that			1
@entity16 teamed up with the @entity89 to reveal the 50 worst charities in @entity39			1
anyone considering donating money to a charity needs to first check out this list			0
these charities have raised millions of dollars pulling on the heartstrings of @entity39 by claiming to help children dying of cancer , disabled veterans , the less fortunate and others in need			2
what are they really doing ? only giving pennies on the dollar to those they purport to assist while keeping 80 % to 90 % of the money raised for administrative costs -- such as paying their officers			0
we also highlighted some of the best charities in @entity39 , including the @entity114 , @entity115 and the new " @entity117 charity , " where i pledge to use 100 % of the money raised to help me , @entity117			1
finally , we turned to erotic books and the @entity120			1
no , the @entity120 has n't started secretly spying on people who read erotica or investigating whether the " letters to @entity124 " are real			0
as the @entity126 reported , the @entity120 's new no. 2 person , @entity125 , once co-owned a bookstore where she featured " erotica nights " during which she and her guests would read aloud racy portions of books			2
@entity35 and @entity33 applauded this as showing a human side to @entity125 as well as making the point that women in power can also be sexual beings			2
however , my view is that this type of story typifies why it 's so difficult for women to navigate up the government and corporate ladder			0
more importantly , we would love to hear your views on the three issues featured in this week 's episode of " the @entity22			2
" plus , follow us on @entity151 , we are all needy -- me especially .			0
