@entity0 -- a @entity3 spaceship blasted off tuesday from a launch center in the @entity5 , carrying three astronauts on what is expected to be the @entity10 giant 's longest crewed mission yet			1
propelled by a @entity15 - @entity14 rocket , the @entity12 craft is scheduled to dock with the @entity17 space module where the crew will transfer supplies to the space lab , which has been in orbit since september 2011			1
@entity3 has stepped up the pace of its space program since first sending astronaut @entity24 into orbit in 2003			1
in 2012 , it conducted 18 space launches , according to the @entity28			0
tuesday 's launch from the the @entity30 marks the start of @entity3 's fifth crewed space mission			1
footage broadcast by state broadcaster @entity33 showed the craft lift off from the @entity5 's flat expanse and arrow into the empty blue sky			0
officials at the launch center looked on as it gained altitude , gradually shedding stages of the rocket			0
during its 15 days in orbit , the crew will master the rendezvous and docking capabilities that are essential for the operation of a manned space platform			1
" the functionality , performance , and coordination of all systems will be evaluated during this mission , " @entity52 , a spokesperson for @entity3 's @entity53 , told a news conference on monday ahead of the launch			1
she added that another main objective of the mission was to test technologies related to the construction of a space station as @entity3 seeks to establish a long - term human presence in space			1
the most recent crewed mission last year carried its first female astronaut and was the first to make a manual docking with the space module			1
the crew for this mission will also include a woman , @entity75 , and two male astronauts , @entity77 and @entity78			0
" these longer duration missions and space dockings are essential practice for any kind of long - term , more permanent presence in space or a mission to , say , the moon , " said @entity79 , a research fellow at the @entity81 - based @entity80			2
growing power @entity3 's march into space underscores the country 's growing financial and military clout and has unsettled some @entity95 observers			1
a 92 - page report on @entity3 military development released by the @entity28 last month highlighted the advances in @entity3 's space capabilities			1
" @entity3 is developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its capabilities to limit or prevent the use of space - based assets by adversaries during times of crisis or conflict , " the report said			1
a spokeswoman for @entity3 's manned space missions said last year the program would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan ( us $ 6.27 billion )			1
the @entity112 closed its space shuttle program in 2011 and is no longer aggressively pursuing manned space exploration , leaving @entity115 and @entity3 as the only two countries in the world capable of independently sending humans into space			2
" in some ways , they have overtaken the @entity112 , at least temporarily , " says the @entity80 's @entity79			0
" of course , the @entity112 , and even more @entity115 , have more experience in manned space			0
@entity3 is not , at this time , capable of reaching the @entity124			2
" " but like the tortoise and the hare , @entity3 is slowly catching up with the @entity112			2
" however , @entity79 says that @entity3 is not engaged in a space race with the @entity112			2
rather : " they have a long - term plan , and they are sticking to it			0
" private space ambitions companies like @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 are scrambling to develop private sector spacecraft and operate in what has previously been the exclusive preserve of sovereign nations			0
@entity3 is not part of the project that maintains the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) , which currently orbits the @entity144 conducting experiments in a range of fields , from physics to astronomy			0
the @entity142 is a joint venture between @entity150 , @entity115 's @entity151 space agency , @entity153 's @entity152 , the @entity154 and the @entity156 @entity155			0
@entity3 views its multi-billion dollar space program as a way to raise prestige both domestically and abroad			2
this is the first high - profile space launch since new leader @entity161 assumed the presidency in march			1
public reaction to the planned mission was mixed , with some users of the @entity168 - like @entity167 platform wishing the astronauts well , while others said the resources were best used on the ground			0
" our country may be lagging behind in other areas , but @entity3 has great achievement in aerospace technology , " said one user with the handle @ @entity175			2
" the government should spend more money to help those of lowest social status , " said another user identified as @ @entity181			0
journalist @entity185 wrote and reported from @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity186 reported from @entity187			0

this is @entity3 's fifth crewed space mission and is scheduled to last 15 days
it is the first high - profile launch since @entity161 became president in march
