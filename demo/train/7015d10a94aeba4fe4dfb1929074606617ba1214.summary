editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " @entity3 , " a new memoir about domestic violence , and the anthology " @entity11 , " which explores the polarization between stay - at - home and career moms			1
@entity2 says domestic violence afflicts the well - to - do as well as the poor			1
( @entity14 ) -- for two days , news reports called her " the 20 - year old victim " allegedly attacked by @entity19 singer and dancer @entity20 in his car early february 8 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
we all now have good reason to believe that the alleged victim was pop singer @entity27 , @entity20 's girlfriend			1
the story has dominated the general media with good reason			2
both singers are young , apple - cheek gorgeous , immensely talented and squeaky clean -- the last couple you 'd imagine as domestic violence headliners			1
perhaps the only good that will come from the @entity27 / @entity20 publicity is destruction of our culture 's misconception that abusers and their victims can only be universally poor , uneducated and powerless			1
@entity20 , whose first song debuted at no. 1 and whose first album topped the @entity44 , appeared on a @entity46 sitcom and in @entity47 , got milk ? and @entity51 's @entity50 commercials			2
@entity52 - born @entity27 has been big - brothered by music industry legends like @entity54 and @entity55 and is signed to the @entity57 label			2
she has been astonishingly successful in the short time she has been on the music scene , attaining five @entity44 no. 1 's with " @entity61 , " " @entity62 , " " @entity63 , " " @entity64 " and @entity66 's " @entity65			2
" like @entity27 , i had a bright future in my early 20s			2
i met my abusive lover at 22			1
i 'd just graduated from @entity70 and had a job at @entity72 in @entity73			2
my husband worked on @entity75 and was an @entity77 graduate as well			2
in our world , we were the last couple you 'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence			1
many of my ex-husband 's attacks also took place in our car			2
for reasons i never understood , the enclosed , soundproof space brought out his worst violence			1
he punched me so fiercely that my face had bruises from his fist on one side and from hitting the window on the other			2
as trapped in the car as i was in our marriage , it was there that i endured tirades about how controlling i was with money , how flirtatious and na√Øve i was with other men , how defiant and disrespectful i was of my husband 's authority			1
so , i suppose i have more understanding than most about the shame , fury , confusion and disappointment @entity27 may be experiencing			2
what 's hardest for outsiders to fathom is how lethal a cocktail love , hope and sympathy can be			2
i first fell for my husband the night he confided how he , like @entity20 , had been traumatized as a young boy by domestic violence in his home			1
" he used to hit my mom ... he made me terrified all the time , terrified like i had to pee on myself , " @entity20 said during a 2007 interview with @entity122			0
@entity20 has n't explained what happened in the recent incident , but this week he released a statement saying that he 's sorry and saddened by it			0
our culture encourages women to nurture men , making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men , as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past			1
in my case , it took four years , myriad terrifying attacks , and the intervention of the police and family court before i understood how little i could help my ex get over his abusive childhood			1
i certainly felt alone during my abusive relationship , but unfortunately i was in good company			1
the @entity149 @entity148 estimates that between 1 million and 3 million women in @entity149 are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend each year			1
every day , on average , three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends			1
at some point in our lives , 25 percent of @entity149 women will report being physically abused or raped by intimate partners , according to the @entity161 conducted by the @entity162			1
however , these statistics , grim as they are , fail to highlight the root of the abuse cycle			1
a national survey showed that 50 percent of men who frequently assault their wives also frequently abuse their children			1
witnessing abuse , as @entity20 and my ex-husband did as young boys , is a form of abuse itself			1
tragically , many victims of childhood abuse grow up to be abusers themselves			1
i always sensed that my husband did n't want to be hurting me -- he knew exactly how excruciating love and fear felt mixed together -- but his childhood rage overpowered his adult sensibilities			0
a few months after i left my marriage , i happened across another couple in another car , late at night on an empty street			0
i slowed down as a well - dressed woman about 25 years old was walking away from a white @entity190 , brushing off a tall , handsome young man wearing a sports coat and jeans			1
suddenly she turned and tried to run			0
he grabbed her with his long arms and shoved her up against a dirty storefront			0
even from my car i could see the fear on her pretty face			0
without thinking , i jerked my car over and got out			0
by this time the man had let the woman go and she 'd slid behind the wheel of the car			0
he stepped back as i approached , his anger displaced by uncertainty and shame at being interrupted			0
i did n't look at him			0
i leaned into the car as she sat clutching the wheel , crying and staring straight ahead			0
" i just left a husband who beat me for three years , " i said			2
" you do not have to put up with this			0
you do not deserve to be treated like this			0
" " i know , " she whispered as fresh tears poured down her face			0
she sniffed loudly and shook her head			0
she would n't look at me			0
her eyes were rimmed red , but i could see resolve in them			0
" you 're right , " she said			0
" it 's just taking me longer than i thought			0
" as i left , i gave the man a long stare			0
the spell had been broken and his face was open , sorrowful , filled with hope and fear -- a look i had seen dozens of times on my husband 's face			0
how long would that look last before he got angry again ? i could feel the woman 's determination as i got back into my car			0
i knew she would be all right , one day			0
the man , i was less certain about			0
family violence is a criminal act ; perpetrators , while often former victims themselves , need to accept culpability			2
until we can prevent children from witnessing and becoming victims of abuse , the cycle will repeat itself : there will be many more @entity249 and " alleged victims " in our headlines and in our homes			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
