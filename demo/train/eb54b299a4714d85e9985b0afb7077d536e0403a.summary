third - flight @entity1 claimed another @entity4 scalp to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity6 , football 's oldest cup competition not content with coming from two goals down to stun @entity10 in the previous round , @entity1 followed up sunday with a 2 - 0 victory over @entity13 at @entity14			1
an early own goal from @entity16 and a @entity18 strike on the hour mark helped continue @entity1 's fairytale cup run in a pulsating fifth round tie			2

@entity1 was then in the fourth - flight of @entity42 football and has since been promoted to the tier above , but still ranked 37 places below @entity13			1
it did not show as @entity47 's third minute shot took a wicked deflection off former @entity49 star @entity16 to leave his side immediately on the backfoot			0
@entity13 finally woke up and manager @entity52 and his bench were furious when @entity54 had penalty claims turned away after going down under @entity57 's challenge			2
@entity59 international @entity58 twice went close to an equalizer , but it was his defensive mistake that allowed @entity18 to score the crucial second goal			0
later sunday , @entity63 continued its defense of the @entity6 with a comfortable 2 - 0 home win over second - flight @entity66 as @entity68 scored two goals in quick succession in the first half			1
the @entity72 might have added to the tally after dominating the tie , but @entity66 , chasing promotion to the @entity4 , had an effort hit the woodwork in injury time			2
@entity79 , with new manager @entity80 in attendance , had a welcome distraction from its league woes with a 2 - 1 win over fellow @entity4 relegation candidates @entity86			1
saturday 's action saw a shock 4 - 1 defeat for @entity90 at @entity91 , while @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 also reached the quarterfinals			0
@entity96 's @entity49 will complete the fifth round action at third - tier @entity98 monday			0
@entity100 hat - trick in @entity101 , @entity100 marked his 300th @entity103 appearance with a hat - trick as @entity105 beat @entity106 5 - 0			1
it was his 23rd career triple in @entity103 -- drawing him level with @entity108 -- and took him to 26 league goals for the season			0
the @entity112 victory also leaves @entity105 a single point behind arch - rival @entity114 in the title race with third - placed reigning champion @entity117 staying seven points adrift with a shock 2 - 0 defea later sunday against @entity121			1
@entity123 's @entity122 had given the @entity125 giants an early lead , connecting with a @entity100 cross as his mishit volley found its way into the net			0
@entity100 doubled the advantage just before halftime and took the game out of @entity106 's reach with his second on the hour mark			0
he completed his hat - trick from the penalty spot after @entity122 had been fouled and @entity139 came off the bench to score a superb fifth .			0

third - flight @entity1 beats @entity13 in @entity6
@entity1 stunned @entity4 leader @entity10 in previous round
@entity63 continues @entity6 defense by beating @entity66 2 - 0
