-- @entity1 used wednesday 's episode of his @entity1 live show to declare november 17 , 2010 @entity4 [ @entity5 ] -- a new holiday he hopes will inspire @entity8 users to unfriend the social networking contacts that are n't real friends			1
late night talk show host @entity1 believes @entity8 is cheapening the meaning of friendship			1
" @entity5 is the international day when all @entity8 users shall protect the sacred nature of friendship by cutting out any ' friend fat ' on their pages occupied by people who are not truly their friends , " according to the show 's website			2
admittedly , @entity8 friending does seem to be out of control			2
@entity8 was once the social networking site we chose over @entity26 to connect with our real friends ; but over the years , many of us have accumulated dozens , if not hundreds , of @entity8 friends that are , in fact , not actually our friends			0
@entity1 may have a point , but this rather funny joke of a holiday seems to be more a late night comedy sketch than an event manufactured out of real concern for the status of friendship			0
still , @entity4 is good natured -- at least for those not being unfriended -- and we might even take the day to cut some friend fat of our own			0
