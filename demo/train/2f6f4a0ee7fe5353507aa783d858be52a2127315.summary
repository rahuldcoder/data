@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 's not sure how he contracted @entity4 -- it may have been from a tainted needle or a sex worker			1
either way , the virus saw his weight plunge below 40 kilograms before he left his home in @entity12 to seek help in @entity1 's largest city , @entity0			1
now 34 , @entity3 is working for @entity15 © decins @entity16 ¨ res ( @entity17 ) -- or @entity17 -- as a counselor for @entity4 patients too scared to expose their illness for fear of being ostracized or ignored			1
" i 'm no longer afraid to speak out , " he says in halted @entity22 at @entity17 headquarters , occasionally stopping to sip tea and get the words straight in his head			1
he 's a singer who , at the height of his illness , was too sick to peform , but after his treatment clinched third place in @entity31 , the country 's version of @entity34			2
just over one year ago , @entity17 issued an urgent plea for help to treat an estimated 85,000 @entity1 people with @entity4			1
at the time only a fraction were getting vital antiretroviral therapy ( @entity40 ) , creating heartbreaking decisions for doctors who had to choose who was treated and who was turned away			0
" every day we are confronted with the tragic consequences of these decisions : desperately sick people and unnecessary deaths , " the head of @entity17 's @entity1 mission , @entity47 , said in a report , " @entity53 , " released in february 2012			1
it was n't a new phenomenon			0
back in 2008 , the medical group issued an even more desperate call for help to halt @entity1 's hiv epidemic			1
the situation for sufferers was critical , it warned , due to a severe lack of @entity63 " unless @entity40 provision is rapidly scaled - up , many more people will needlessly suffer and die , " @entity64 warned in the report " a @entity66			0
" at the time , of 240,000 estimated to be carrying the @entity4 virus , 76,000 were in urgent need of art. of those , only 11,000 people were being treated			1
fast - forward to 2013 and the numbers tell the story of a dire situation brought back from the brink			0
around 125,000 people are now estimated to need art in @entity1 but money has been pledged to retreat 85 % of them , around 106,000 people , said dr. @entity81 , @entity17 's medical coordinator in @entity0			1
it 's due to the return of the @entity84 , which pulled its funding in 2011 due to a lack of donations			0
just over $ 160 million has been pledged until the end of 2016 to pay for @entity4 treatment and prevention programs for people most at risk of falling ill. the return of funding follows the transition of power from the military junta that ruled @entity1 for 50 years to democratically elected president @entity99 , who took office in march 2011			1
since then , international sanctions have been lifted and the country 's been working with foreign governments and delegations to repair decades of neglect			0
while new funding for @entity4 treatment is flowing into the country , @entity17 warns that extending healthcare to 106,000 people is a slow process			1
so far the medication is only reaching 50,000			0
" we still need to overcome a lot of challenges ahead , " said dr. @entity81			0
" there is a need for capacity building , decentralizing the care delivery , and the stronger engagement of partners , including the @entity121			0
" and there 's another pressing issue : eradicating the stigma associated with having @entity4 in @entity1			1
that 's where @entity3 comes in			2
in 2006 , when he was first diagnosed , he was too scared to speak out for fear of people 's reactions			0
he started attending group sessions at @entity17 and soon realized that he was one of the few people he could find the strength to talk			2
" most of the patients were depressed so i disclosed my status and experience to help support them , " he said			2
he tells the story of an @entity4 patient whose family refused to attend his funeral , and of the @entity4 positive eight - year - old boy who went home crying from school after his teacher told him not to play with other children			2
@entity3 now gives talks in schools and to anyone else who will listen as part of the support group @entity151			2
his claims of discrimination against @entity1 's @entity4 patients are backed by a @entity156 report released in 2011			1
the " @entity163 " found that 31 % of @entity1 respondents said that they had been excluded from social gatherings , including weddings , parties , funerals , because of their @entity4 status			1
it was the highest proportion of nine @entity166 countries surveyed , including @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			0
one quarter said , within the last 12 months , they had felt discriminated against by their own families , 45 % said they had been verbally or physically assaulted and 78 % said they were aware that people were talking about them behind their backs			0
one quarter felt suicidal and around the same number said discrimination had forced them to quit their jobs			0
@entity3 says attitudes are beginning to change , but it will take time and a change in government policy to protect the rights of @entity4 patients			1
but he has a powerful ally in the form of @entity1 opposition leader and @entity193 laureate @entity192 , who last month joined 200 people for a candlelight vigil to remember those who have died from @entity197 - related illnesses			2
" respect for the human rights of people living with @entity4 must be promoted , " she told the crowd			2
" we also need to protect the people who live on the fringes of society who struggle every day to maintain their dignity and basic human rights			0
" i believe that with true compassion -- the invisible cord that binds us to other human beings regardless of race , personal status , religion and national borders -- we can get results for all people			0
" @entity218 contributed to this report .			0

new funding means more @entity1 hiv patients are receiving treatment
discrimination is still a problem , many sufferers are too scared to reveal status
@entity3 has @entity4 and is now working with @entity17 to combat the @entity4 stigma in @entity1
according to a @entity156 survey , one third say they *'ve* been socially excluded
