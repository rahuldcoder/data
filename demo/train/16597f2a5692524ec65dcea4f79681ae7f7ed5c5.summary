@entity0 -- the biggest worry -- and potential opportunity -- for president @entity4 and his fellow @entity5 this midterm election year came into full focus this past week , and it had nothing to do with the latest @entity11 numbers or newly released @entity13 emails about @entity14			1
sure , those issues matter now and will undoubtedly factor into the final six months of @entity16			0
but to borrow a line from @entity18 , " it 's the economy , stupid			0
" that slogan was the most important wall hanging in the @entity25 headquarters of the @entity27 presidential campaign , the strategic imperative strategists @entity19 and @entity21 imposed on a campaign that often , especially early on , seemed to be careening into questions of character and credibility			0
fast forward 22 years , and a variation of " it 's the economy , stupid " is what the @entity13 and vulnerable @entity5 on the 2014 ballot had hoped would be their best weapon against @entity37 attacks -- and against the history of midterm elections			2
and it is the economy -- and voter perception of the economy -- that is making it so difficult for @entity4 to improve his political standing			1
there are numbers to support the @entity5 case that things are better -- especially when compared to the deep recession @entity4 inherited in january 2009			1
just friday , the @entity51 reported the april 2014 unemployment rate to be 6.3 % -- down from 6.7 % in march and the lowest jobless rate since september 2008			1
more context -- and ammunition for the @entity13 case that the trajectory of the economy is now strong : april 's unemployment rate is down from 7.5 % a year ago , and from 9 % in april 2009 , a few months into the @entity4 presidency			1
helping push the rate down : the economy added 288,000 jobs last month -- the best month - to - month gain in more than two years			2
during a news conference with @entity66 chancellor @entity65 on friday , @entity4 highlighted april 's growth in jobs and gave the @entity70 people credit for their " grit and determination " for the economic rebound			1
add in this : the @entity76 closed thursday at 16,558 , a tad off a record high hit wednesday			0
that 's more than double the april 30 , 2009 , close : 8,168			0
now , in the political debate over the economy , the question is this : will @entity70 process the drop in the jobless rate and a strong monthly jobs number as proof the recovery has deep roots , or as just another month on the roller coaster ? the question is very real , in part because as @entity5 try to focus on the " good " data , there is consistent competition from less encouraging and , at times , quite discouraging numbers			1
hiring is up in april , unemployment down the government on wednesday , for example , reported that the economy stalled significantly in the first quarter of 2014 -- with the gdp increasing just 0.1 %			1
and even in friday 's unemployment report there is fodder for the pessimists : the workforce shrunk by 806,000 people -- meaning there were fewer people actively looking for work			2
plus , the number of long - term unemployed -- those without jobs for 27 weeks or longer -- stands at 3.5 million people			1
the liberal @entity115 attributed the decline of the unemployment rate in april " entirely due to people dropping out of the labor force			2
" its estimate of what @entity115 calls " missing workers " -- people who are not working or actively seeking work -- is a record 6.2 million @entity70			2
count them , and the real unemployment rate would be 9.9 %			2
house speaker @entity126 called the exodus from the workforce " troubling " and said , " we need more robust economic growth if we 're going to help the millions who remain unemployed get back on their feet			0
" @entity5 leader @entity135 said @entity37 were in the way of creating more jobs and helping the long - term unemployed			1
" the @entity37 approach shows nothing but contempt and disregard for working families , " @entity135 said in a statement			0
here is what to watch between now and election day : * will robust month to month job growth become the norm ? * will the jobless rate fall to or below 6 % ? * and , perhaps most importantly in the political context , will voter sentiment about the economy shift in any significant way ? at the moment , that sentiment is negative -- and a major drag on the president 's political standing			1
two national surveys this week offered sobering numbers on the " right track / wrong track " question : the @entity165 / @entity164 survey found 63 % of @entity70 believe the country is on the wrong track			1
an @entity169 / @entity168 poll put the " wrong track " number at 66 percent			0
political battle over jobs report in that @entity169 / @entity168 survey , just 28 % of @entity70 described economic conditions as getting better			1
so more than seven in 10 @entity70 think the economy is treading water or getting worse			2
in the @entity165 / @entity164 survey , 41 % of @entity70 said the economy had improved some and @entity4 deserved some credit			1
seventeen percent said it had improved but that the president did n't deserve much credit			0
forty - two percent said it had not really improved			0
@entity37 pollster @entity183 says history is clear on the question : " here is a rule that no president has been able to beat yet in an off - year election : high wrong track and weak economic confidence are crippling to the electoral prospects of the party that controls the presidency			0
" that economic pessimism is the source of considerable frustration at the @entity13			0
there , the parallel to 1992 is striking			0
then -- a presidential year not a midterm -- the growth numbers were far more robust than now			0
but the pain of the early 1990s recession had left deep scars and the @entity206 political operation was unable to make a persuasive case things were on the upswing and that he deserved the credit			1
this time , in the off year , @entity5 strategist @entity210 says it is imperative that her party not let all the political blame fall on the president			2
" i do n't see @entity37 convincing people they have a plan for the economy that people like , or , frankly , that they have much of a plan for the economy at all , '' @entity218 said			0
she also made the case -- and the polling data backs this up -- that the @entity37 brand is severely tainted at the moment , and that in most cases @entity5 have an edge when voters are asked which party they trust more on economic fairness questions			1
" that said , i think the constant fighting and inaction in @entity0 hurts both parties ' image , even if it generally hurts @entity37 more , " @entity218 said			0
" and @entity5 have certainly lost elections before while still having the advantage on the issues			0
" the @entity5 ' election - year strategy includes a focus on economic issues where the party believes it can draw sharp contrasts with @entity37 , among them equal pay and an increase in the minimum wage			2
working against the @entity5 effort , however , or at least complicating it , is a voter crisis of confidence when it comes to political leadership			1
recent @entity255 polling is instructive on this question : * just 42 % of @entity70 are confident about @entity4 's economic prescriptions			1
" not surprisingly , given his low ratings on the economy , it is a drag on the overall approval rating , " the @entity37 's @entity183 said			0
* only 35 % voice confidence about @entity5 leaders in @entity264 on the economy			2
* and an anemic 24 % say they are confident @entity37 congressional leaders would do the right thing about the economy .			0

the @entity51 reported april unemployment at 6.3 % -- the lowest since september 2008
the numbers could support the @entity5 case things are better than when @entity4 took office
the question is whether @entity70 will believe the recovery is *sustainable* or just a blip
struggles of the long - term unemployed , voter *mistrust* of political leadership might hurt *democrats*
