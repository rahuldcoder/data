-- @entity1 and @entity2 have just one goal , really : run the best bag company in the world			1
it might sound like a stretch for a company of three people operating out of a 1,300 - square - foot workshop in @entity11			2
but @entity12 , a self - trained leather craftsman and unabashed perfectionist , does n't see the point in striving for anything less			1
" there are a lot of people making stuff ; you have to be unique and offer something different			0
you just have to make it better , " said the 33 - year - old father of three , who runs the company , @entity27 , with his wife , @entity28			1
" the world does n't need another widget ; it needs a better widget			0
" it 's a philosophy that seems to be working so far for @entity27 , which is named after @entity2 's hometown of @entity27 in mountainous eastern @entity35			1
in less than four years , @entity27 's handmade bags and accessories have drawn the attention of major retailers and customers worldwide , proving a small operation can make a big splash			1
but , as @entity27 branches into new territory with women 's handbags and clutches , the @entity43 are playing it safe when it comes to growing their company -- part of the reason they have only one employee who helps create their products			1
" i want to grow , but i 'm not going to grow for the sake of growth , " @entity12 said			1
" i want to make some money , but i have the long view and i want to make sure we 're doing it right			0
" shopping made in @entity64 from their workshop in @entity11 's @entity66 , the @entity43 work constantly to fulfill orders			0
it 's been that way since 2010 , @entity2 said , when lifestyle magazine @entity71 's " @entity72 " awards recognized @entity27 's " elegantly simple " bags made by hand from rich , heavy leather and waxed canvas			1
@entity2 's smartphone began ringing with orders , prompting him to disable the notification alert			1
to keep up , he decided to quit his day job as a computer salesman for @entity82			0
" we could n't justify taking orders unless we had a long - term plan for fulfilling them , " @entity2 said			1
" it has n't stopped since then			0
" ' it 's not for everybody ' @entity12 's fascination with leather - working began in a shoe and saddle repair store in his @entity95 hometown			1
in college , he taught himself to sew by mending his own clothes and discovered that he enjoyed it			0
when he could n't afford a leather tote bag , he made his own			2
it was far from a masterpiece , he recalls , but he was hooked and hell - bent on mastering the process			0
making bags and wallets on nights and weekends sustained him through a handful of unfulfilling jobs -- automotive restoration , unloading boxes , customizing tour buses for musical acts -- that enabled him to support his growing family			0
he began selling his handiwork at craft shows around @entity11 and throughout the region , catching the attention of @entity120 and @entity121 , the couple behind @entity64 denim company @entity123			1
they began to carry @entity27 bags in their @entity11 store and in 2009 , the two companies collaborated on a bag for the @entity130 men 's boutique in @entity131 , earning the attention of other department stores , including @entity134			1
made in @entity64 : the short list the orders kept coming in			0
they have yet to clear the wait list , @entity2 says			1
by 2012 , @entity2 was ready to move his workshop out of the family garage and into a workspace in @entity11 's @entity66			1
he shared the space for about a year with another budding @entity11 designer , men 's accessories maker @entity146			2
by 2013 , both businesses had grown to the point that they needed their own workshops			0
standards over growth despite the growth , the @entity43 do n't measure success by the number of wallets and belts they sell			2
to them , being the best means making a distinct product that meets their standards			0
it 's part of the reason they have n't hired more people , he said			0
@entity2 makes each bag to order by hand , a craft he said requires a certain amount of raw talent			1
" it 's not for everybody -- or maybe i 'm not for everybody , " he said , laughing			2
" you ca n't just want to do it and make it happen , not to the level that i expect or our customers expect			2
" otherwise , @entity27 is growing and changing in other ways			1
the @entity43 just launched a line of women 's handbags and clutches in a design collaboration			2
the company recently stopped doing wholesale and started selling exclusively through their website			2
it might sound counterintuitive for a company trying to expand , but it allows them to bring down the cost of their products and interact directly with customers , @entity2 said			1
" that 's the joy of being a small business			0
we can do whatever we want as long as it makes sense for us and it 's fair for our customers , " he said			2
besides , he did n't start a family business to get rich , he said			0
he did it because he loves working with his hands and having something to show for his efforts			0
" we 're not building this as a brand just to sell something			0
we want to build it as a legacy for our children and grandchildren , " he said			0
" but it would be nice to walk away from work for a week			0

@entity1 and @entity2 launched bag and accessories company @entity27 in 2009
the line has drawn attention from customers worldwide and retailers @entity134 and @entity130
" i want to grow , but i 'm not going to grow for the sake of growth , " @entity12 says
