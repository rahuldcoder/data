-- while most photos are digital these days , there was a time when sepia - toned hard copies of pictures were regarded as precious relics -- and families would be thrilled to get their hands on any from times past			1
some lucky families were recently able to do just that , thanks to the effort of one @entity14 , @entity15 , man			2
when @entity18 , facilities supervisor for the @entity19 , came across bags of old photographs at the center while cleaning up in 2005 , he could have just thrown them out with the rest of the trash			2
a self - described history buff and amateur genealogist , @entity18 was already hooked on working with old images			1
" i am a collector , " he told @entity28			0
" i collected a lot of old military things for years			0
my interest in genealogy started when my grandmother passed down a photo album from the 1860s			0
" @entity18 traced his own family tree and learned that his family came to the @entity38 from @entity39 in the mid- 1800s			2
so when he discovered the photos at the nursing home , @entity18 decided to take on the challenge of getting the photos back to their owners -- or at least their owners ' living relatives			1
but how do you trace photos that are from so long ago ? " i started by turning them face - down , feeling thickness of paper to separate the batches			0
i also used stamps to discern time taken and where they were developed , " @entity18 said			1
he also used phone books , newspaper archives , @entity61 information and the genealogy site of the @entity63 to aid his research			0
@entity18 had the photos for eight years before he finally found a lead that connected him to what he was looking for in november			1
" the big breakthrough was that finally i found some of the people they should belong to , " he said			0
" i did it on my own			0
i used @entity72 for some of the research , but i 'm the last person to get a cell phone and a computer , " he laughed			0
the bags contained roughly 150 photos , some of them dating as far back as 1890			0
one man -- @entity18 describes him as " very distinctive " -- appeared in many of the photos , from baby pictures to older shots			1
@entity18 discovered his name was @entity87 ( which was also written on one of the bags the photos were in ) , but that there was no link between him and the nursing home			1
" i found @entity95 's brother and sister after doing some research in @entity98 , " @entity18 said			1
" i found a newspaper clipping that led me to believe that a woman named @entity101 was married to a man that was related to @entity95			2
and it turned out that @entity95 's sister , @entity106 , and her brother , @entity108 , had a baby -- and that was @entity111 , @entity101 's husband			0
" the @entity113 were n't the only family @entity18 was able to track down			1
he also managed to track down the @entity116 family in @entity117 , @entity15 , and give @entity116 photos of his great - great - grandfather he had never seen before			0
" you know more about my family than i do , " @entity18 said @entity116 told him when they met for the first time			1
he was right , too -- @entity18 had managed to find @entity116 's relative by tracing a @entity125 draft registration and then finding descendants of the name			2
while @entity18 has many more photos to go through , he said he feels happy that he has finally met with some success .			2

man returns found photos to families in his free time
the *property* manager is also a history buff
