@entity0 -- the @entity2 is no stranger to superlatives : the world 's tallest building , among the world 's most expensive hotels , even the largest kebab			1
the country has more than 100 world records to its name , so it 's little wonder that @entity15 has decided to open an office in @entity0 next year to make it easier for people and businesses in the region to have their attempts certified			1
@entity22 , the head of @entity15 's @entity0 office , says the region has seen huge growth in recent years			1
" in the @entity2 , @entity27 and @entity28 , we 've seen an increase of 300 to 400 % in the number of applications over the past five years			2
the aim of this office is to make it easier , to make it quicker for people and businesses all across the region to access and achieve world records , " he told @entity1			1
there have been several this year alone : the largest handprint in @entity41 , the longest table in @entity0 or the most people to parachute - jump from a hot - air balloon			1
@entity22 has overseen more than 300 records across the world , and relocated from @entity48 to @entity0 just to cope with the new demand in the @entity50			1
he says any record attempt must meet four criteria to even be considered : 1 ) it must be measureable -- longest , heaviest , fastest etc 2 ) it must be verifiable , that is to say you must provide evidence to prove it 3 ) the record must be breakable , in other words it can be challenged in the future 4 ) the record must have one single variable : you can not have the longest , fastest marathon , they 'll either measure the longest or the fastest			2
@entity67 , president of @entity68 , says the organization is moving with the times in a bid to attract younger readers			1
" we 've got a website and of course it 's got the news daily as to what records are being broken around the world , " he said			2
" it also as a website will give you a link to our @entity85 site , @entity86 , @entity87			0
there 's also a section of the website where you can video yourself on let 's say your mobile phone doing something you think is really cool that you think should be a @entity68 but as far as you know it 's not at the moment			0
" so this is really going after and encouraging the sort of 14 to 24 - year - old boys and girls to have a go at record breaking , which is all about self - esteem and self - worth but that 's a bigger question as to why @entity68 still exists after 56 years			2
" so the website for instance now gets 1 million unique visitors a month , the vast majority of which are all about , they 're looking at records and they 're making record inquiries or they 're enquiring about record claims			0
" " the @entity68 is about the amazing superlatives that make up our physical world or our universe but at the heart of it is just about human beings and it 's a measure as to how unique and amazing each and everyone of us is			0
so in that sense we reflect society			0
so lots of who 's got the most fans on @entity86 , who 's got the most @entity87 followers or who 's been tweeted the most in 24 hours			0
so for example , president @entity130 when he gets four more years , that got retweeted some 770,000 times , within 24 hours , it 's that type of record now that is probably the most popular			1
" here are some recent records that have been set in the @entity50 the greatest distance covered in 24 hours in a motorized wheelchair			2
@entity140 , an @entity2 travelled the 141km from @entity142 to @entity143 in @entity144 in 14 hours , 28 seconds on a solar - powered wheelchair			0
the world 's biggest kebab , weighing 468kg , was made by @entity148 on @entity149 in 2012 the longest line of sandwiches , measuring 2,667.13 meters , was created by @entity152 and @entity153 in september 2010			0
the world 's heaviest gold ring , the @entity156 ( " @entity160 " ) was created by @entity157 of @entity27 at the @entity158 in @entity159 in april 2009			0
the ring , weighing 63.856 kilograms , consisted of 5.17kg of precious jewels set in a 58.686kg , 21 - carat gold ring			0
the largest coin , 1 meter wide , 2.3 centimetres thick and weighing 185kg , was made in @entity0			1
the world 's most expensive cocktail , " the 27.321 , " named for its 27,321 dirham ( $ 7,400 ) price tag , features on the menu of the @entity170 at @entity171			0
@entity0 's @entity172 , completed in 2013 , is the world 's tallest residential tower at 413.4 meters and with 100 above - ground floors .			1
