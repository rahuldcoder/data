-- we all have bad habits			1
most everyone will agree that one of the very worst habits -- if not the worst habit -- is cigarette smoking			1
because , really , as far as poor life choices go , it 's right up there with setting your dvr for " @entity15			2
" nothing good can come from it			2
but one horribly addicted man in @entity19 is determined to quit , and he 's taking his efforts to a hilarious new level			1
because , after 26 years of cigarettes , @entity22 has decided to encase his entire head in a metal cage			1
and , hell , it might just work			2
@entity29 , generally speaking , that kind of self - imposed personal torture is usually best reserved for adventurous bedroom shenanigans with shady ( yet willing ) people you meet on @entity33			1
but @entity22 is serious about kicking his two - pack - a - day habit , and , as a last - ditch effort , it 's all come down to the metal head cage			1
which has now gone somewhat viral			2
a video detailing his master plan recently surfaced on @entity44 , and amazed viewers got to watch @entity22 's wife literally lock him in for the day before he headed off to work			1
which , despite his positive , health - conscious intentions , is a terribly misguided decision			1
as someone who had to wear orthodontic headgear as a kid , i can assure you there 's no glory being seen in public looking like @entity56			2
but our hero does n't seem to care , and perhaps this low - tech solution is the solution			1
amazingly , @entity22 created the device all by himself using 130 feet of copper wire			1
which , on the down side , means if he ever wears it into the wrong neighborhood , it 'll be gone in less than 10 minutes			2
" come on ! " but , until then the cage , which has only two keys that are kept by his wife and daughter , should prevent him from getting cigarettes up to his mouth , while providing just enough room for sliding in crackers and a flattened drinking straw			1
@entity22 is motivated by the memory of his father , who died of lung cancer , and i applaud the man for trying to quit			1
i wish more of you would do the same			2
not so much because i care about your health , but because my biggest pet peeve in life is when people throw their butts on the ground			2
unfortunately , even the kindest , most law - abiding citizens do it			1
apparently , at some point in history a bunch of old dudes got together to make the rules of life and officially agreed that , for whatever reason , this would not be considered litter			2
" beer bottles ? " " litter ! " " fast - food wrappers ? " " litter ! " " hey , what about cigarette butts ? " " shut up , @entity109			1
" to me , tossing butts on the ground is a habit almost as bad as actually smoking			1
and it 's definitely worse than booger eating			0
fortunately , though , the majority of personal bad habits are rather innocent and do n't have any real negative impact on society as a whole			0
for instance , i drink waaay too much @entity125 , and none of you are any worse off because of it			0
save for my distracted co-workers who sit near the men 's room			0
" sadly , there are some habits that are so bad to the point where they do n't even technically qualify as habits			0
for example , setting things on fire really should n't be " your thing			0
" " good grief , @entity142			0
you got ta stop doing that			0
" " i know , right ? " but smoking is still pretty bad			1
so , if you 're not interested in donning @entity22 's giant metal cage , and if the patch and the gum are n't working , i know of only one other sure - fire way to quit : move to @entity150 , @entity151			1
never in my life have i seen cigarettes so expensive , where bumming one on the streets is basically like asking a stranger to pay your next mortgage bill			0
mind you , i 'm not a smoker			0
but when i visit a foreign city i find you can often get a pulse for the general cost of living by how much they charge for beer and cigarettes			0
and , at least from my travels , that 's about as bad as i 've seen it			0
so , go to @entity151 , and i promise you 'll be well on your way to better health			0
unless , of course , you simply get killed just by virtue of being in that country			0
fun fact : nine out of ten things in @entity151 are venomous			0
but if all your foreign travel money is being spent on cigarettes in the first place , maybe you should settle for @entity22 's giant metal cage			1
even if it does n't work , at least you 'll still have it for the next time you browse @entity33			0
and that can be fun			0
follow @entity190 on @entity191 .			0
