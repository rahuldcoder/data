@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 , the historic jewel of @entity1 's @entity5 coast , is a secret that 's getting out			1
the city 's spectacular setting is a draw in itself			1
protected by ancient stone walls that enclose its vibrant port , @entity0 is almost entirely surrounded by the @entity13			1
@entity14 , yellow and purple buildings line the cobblestone streets of the old city , faded after centuries under the powerful sun. billowing flower boxes droop over balconies , drawing the eye up @entity24 colonial facades			1
painted doors of all shapes and sizes open onto lush courtyards or mysterious wine cellars			1
behind many doors visitors will find first - class dining and some of the most interesting boutique shopping in the @entity5			1
between january and august 2010 , more than 111,000 international visitors came to @entity1 , up 9 % from the year before , according to @entity1 immigration authorities			1
of those visitors , 11 % made @entity0 their primary destination			1
historically , @entity1 's struggles with crime have scared away tourists			1
but violence associated with @entity1 's infamous drug trafficking is steadily declining , and @entity0 continues to be one of the safest cities in @entity1			1
another darker side of history dates back much further : the @entity46			1
@entity0 was a vital seaport for @entity24 after colonists founded the city in 1533 , and the coastal city remained under @entity24 rule for more than 275 years			1
in 1610 , a tribunal was established in @entity0 as part of the effort to preserve @entity56 orthodoxy in @entity24 and its kingdoms			1
the @entity60 , in the middle of the old city , is not for the faint of heart			1
guides will ( sometimes gleefully ) take visitors through every instrument of torture used against those the @entity68 deemed heretics			1
note : smiling for photos may feel awkward			2
escape the grim scene onto one of @entity0 's grand public squares and you 'll find locals singing and selling paintings , cds , hats and whatever else there is to offer while the old timers look on from benches surrounding the square			1
take a walk on the 16th - century walls of the old city			2
from there , the sea stretches as far as the eye can see			2
near the walls , mopeds and buses scurry in and out of the city			2
the buses are apt to screech to a sudden halt before their stops and pick up again without warning			2
riders should try to anticipate the driver 's next move , as hopping off at speeds of 10 mph or more seems routine			2
getting around can be both alarming and comical			2
relax and quench your thirst with some of the most coveted and exotic fruit juices in the world , like guanabana , lulo and nispero			2
the guanabana with a hint of milk added is a frothy delight			2
everywhere you look in town there are fruit stands with tiny windows for taking juice orders			2
behind them old ladies use every tool at their disposal to whack and whomp the fruit until the juices pour over the white plastic cups handed out to patrons			2
one lime - aid guy 's reputation as the best in town is confirmed by the lines that form down the street when his cart appears			2
he works quickly , making a delicious drink out of the most basic of recipes : hand - chopped ice , fresh limes and sugar			0
if you want to explore beyond the city walls , arrange a boat ride at the harbor and watch the old city merge into the new as you pull away from the dock			0
modern glass towers occupy a thin stretch of peninsula called @entity146			0
they appear to be built from the sea up to the sky and provide a sharp contrast to the adjacent old city			0
an hour 's boat ride will get you to the @entity153			0
the local beaches in @entity0 are somewhat grimy and tourists often opt for a daytime excursion			1
lay out on a sunbed overlooking the sea and snooze to the sound of the waves softly crashing on the beach			0
for a more active afternoon , try scuba diving and snorkeling offshore			0
spend the rest of the day noshing on fresh seafood and fruit			0
boat back into town to dry off and watch the sunset at the @entity169 it 's a hot spot that attracts tourists and locals and rests on top of the stone walls that surround the city			0
enjoy a michelada ( a local favorite of beer with lime juice in a salt rimmed glass ) and watch the sunset over the @entity5			1
once the sun goes down , the @entity181 heats up with go - go dancers whose silhouettes are framed against the dark sea by smoke machines and laser lights			0
stroll down into the city through plazas shadowed by cathedrals and peppered with restaurants			0
travelers on a budget can find yummy eats at the more casual restaurants with seating spilling out onto the plazas			0
sit outside and you may have a front row seat to an impromptu musical performance			0
you 'll need a reservation at @entity203 , one of @entity0 's most famous restaurants			1
occasionally a bodyguard of a distinguished political patron will be waiting outside , leaving the regular diner to wonder who might be sitting at the next table			0
( it 's common for these politicos to have security and the average traveler need n't take this as a sign that their safety will be compromised			0
) a @entity219 band plays into the night as guests dine on local and @entity219 - inspired cuisine			0
renowned @entity1 - born author @entity222 is known to dine at @entity203 frequently and as a sign of @entity0 's growing foodie reputation , just last month @entity225 listed @entity0 as one of the top wine and food destinations of @entity229			1
the evening can go anywhere from here			0
the dance clubs are just starting to buzz and there is music pouring into the streets from the balconies and doors			1
it 's a form of courtship and communication between the sexes			0
movement and color , swirling skirts and libation ; the old city is alive and pulsing			0
one you 're ready to hang up your shoes you can catch a horse - drawn carriage back to your hotel			0
a delightful way to end the evening , but wait ! your entertainment may not be over yet			0
roaming mariachis may run alongside your carriage and hop on , hoping to serenade you all the way to your hotel ( in exchange for a few coins )			0
some have memorized tunes they consider to be distinctly @entity262			0
you have n't fully experienced @entity0 until you 've had a mariachi sprint alongside and jump on your carriage belting out " @entity264 " at 4 a.m. , refusing to surrender until you 've heard the whole song .			1
