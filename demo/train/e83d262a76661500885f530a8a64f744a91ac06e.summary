a stuffy , overcrowded cell			2
perhaps two or three men to a single bunk			2
lockdown for most of the day			2
is this what awaits @entity7 's @entity6 when he 's sentenced for culpable homicide in the death of girlfriend @entity10 ? legal experts say it 's impossible to predict what sentence judge @entity13 may hand down			1
but many will be watching to see if the @entity17 's dramatic fall from grace ends with time behind bars			1
if that 's indeed the case , the chances are that life would not be easy for @entity7 's most famous disabled athlete			1
a double amputee , he needs prosthetic limbs to get around			1
and rights campaigners warn that @entity7 prisons -- which they say are notorious for overcrowding , gang violence and unsanitary conditions -- are often a difficult environment even for the fittest of inmates			1
@entity35 , project coordinator for the @entity37 - based @entity36 , a civil society group , believes @entity6 would likely receive far better treatment than the average prisoner -- as he has throughout the judicial process , she says			1
that means he might get a cell to himself			2
even so , she told @entity1 , " i do n't think anyone with a disability necessarily will be able to be provided for at the moment in a way that ensures that they would have the correct medical treatment , that they have the correct physical structures			1
" some of @entity7 's prisons are better than others , of course			1
but whichever one might house @entity6 , there 's no question that conditions would be a far cry from those in the $ 560,000 home in the luxury @entity62 , on the outskirts of @entity64 , where he shot @entity10 dead last year			1
@entity66 @entity7 's @entity67 has policies in place for dealing with physically disabled inmates , @entity35 said			1
" policy and practice , however , are often poles apart			0
unfortunately , prisoners with disabilities face the same inhumane conditions as other able - bodied inmates			1
" @entity78 spokesman @entity77 previously told @entity1 that @entity7 's detention facilities , whether for remand prisoners or those serving prison terms , " can accommodate people with any disabilities			1
" there 's been speculation that @entity6 could be sent to @entity87 , although no one really knows			1
it 's not easy for rights researchers to get access inside , @entity35 said			2
but the prison does not have the best reputation			2
the @entity94 reported last year on a case brought by six inmates who told @entity97 of having to share a single cell with others , with no ventilation , dirty mattresses and no bedding			2
they were locked up for 18 hours a day , the court heard , and threatened with sexual violence by gangs			0
@entity10 's mother stunned by verdict , wants to meet @entity6 medical care ' overstretched ' on average , @entity35 said , @entity7 prisons are overcrowded , putting a strain on sanitation , ventilation and medical care			1
the overcrowding means three men may share a single cell , or communal cells for 40 people are jammed with double the number they were intended to hold , with men sleeping in double or triple bunks , according to the @entity36			1
one of the biggest risks associated with that is contracting tuberculosis , labeled the biggest killer in @entity7 's prisons in a recent report , @entity35 said			1
the disease spreads easily in packed , steamy cells with little air			0
in some prisons , overstretched nurses can never see all the people needing help on any day			2
inconsistent treatment regimens mean drug - resistant tb strains develop and spread , while disruptions to antiretroviral programs also impact detainees who are @entity140 - positive			0
" also in terms of health management we 've seen stories of people who are diabetic and have gone into insulin shock because they 've been arrested and have n't been able to get to their medication , " @entity35 said			0
speaking earlier this year , correctional services minister @entity149 said that " overcrowding at correctional facilities is a global challenge , " and that @entity7 's prison population had dropped over the past decade			1
as of april this year , there were about 157,400 inmates , of whom nearly 28 % were on remand -- a term used for pretrial custody , according to official figures			0
the country 's total population is about 54 million			2
who is the judge that 'll be sentencing him ? double - edged sword there 's no doubt that @entity6 ' case has put @entity7 's justice system under the international spotlight			1
while the scrutiny may have been uncomfortable at time for @entity7 authorities , it appears to have worked in the track star 's favor until now			1
when he was first detained after @entity10 's killing , the @entity176 complained that he got special treatment , both in where he was held and in access to his family			1
some impoverished suspects who ca n't afford a lawyer or bail spend months or even years waiting for their cases just to come to court			0
but @entity6 was released on bail with relaxed conditions , and his trial began little more than a year after @entity10 's death on february 14 , 2013			1
@entity35 describes his progress through the legal system as " an anomaly " in terms of both speed and the expert resources dedicated to it			0
" other cases normally take much longer , and both the victims and the accused face the strong probability of a miscarriage of justice , " she wrote in a piece published on @entity201 website			0
however , when it comes to serving time in prison , the athlete 's fame -- and the extra attention that goes with it -- could be a double - edged sword when it comes to getting special privileges , she told @entity1			1
" a lot of people are able to subvert ( the system ) and pay bribes and get away with things , but he has n't been able to , " she said			0
" but on the other hand he has been able to get advantages that other people have n't			0
" ' living here is very hard ' some of these differences may be stark			0
the @entity36 has highlighted the case of paraplegic inmate @entity229 , held on remand for 28 months before being freed on bail earlier this year with an electronic tag , in a pilot monitoring project			1
before his release , he described his experience to @entity236 , a senior journalist with the project			0
" i 'm a 50 - year - old paraplegic and have been awaiting trial for more than two years since my arrest on fraud charges in december 2011			2
i ca n't walk , i ca n't control my bowel or bladder and have to wear disposable baby nappies which my family buy for me			0
i 'm paralysed from level four and do n't have a wheelchair , " he said , according to the project			0
" if i use my [ crutches ] i have to pull my legs and throw them to the front			0
that 's how i walk			2
living here is very hard			0
we are 88 men in this cell which is meant for 32			0
twelve people sleep in two bunks pushed together , that 's six on the top and six on the bottom			2
i have my own bed on the bottom , which is a privilege			0
luckily , i do n't have to share because of my medical status			0
" there are eight or 10 people with @entity264 in this cell and four or five we know are @entity140 - positive			0
a guy with multi-drug resistant @entity264 sleeps on top of me			0
i feel vulnerable all the time			0
" @entity35 argues that as a severely disabled man , @entity229 should never have been in detention at all			0
and if she had her way , the same would be true for @entity6			1
rise of ' cyberathletes ' could change sport as we know it			0

@entity6 is *due* to be sentenced for the *negligent* killing of @entity10
this raises the prospect that the double amputee may be given a prison sentence
@entity7 's prisons are notorious for overcrowding and poor sanitation , activists say
a paraplegic inmate told the @entity36 of being detained in awful conditions
