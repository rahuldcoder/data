editor 's note : @entity2 is president of @entity3			1
@entity2 says @entity4 shows the power of education and innovation to revive an economy in crisis			1
( @entity10 ) -- this week the international community is converging on my chosen hometown of @entity4 , @entity14 , as heads of state gather for the @entity17 summit			1
@entity4 may seem like an unlikely choice for such a high - profile event , but a closer look shows why this city personifies the transformative power of education and research , and how the practical application of innovation can drive growth and improvement in quality of life the world over			1
@entity4 is a city that was largely written off as a rusted industrial center			1
but as heads of state from around the world tour the city this week , they will see running trails replacing former industrial railways and they will find green hotels and @entity41 - certified buildings rising where abandoned steel mills once stood			0
these changes are creating jobs , bringing new commerce and making @entity4 the most livable city in the @entity47 , according to the @entity49 magazine			1
president @entity50 has praised our city as a " bold example " of the new green economy			2
a significant part of @entity4 's renaissance can be attributed to its two major research universities : @entity3 and the @entity58			1
having one such institution is an advantage in today 's global economy ; having two ( very close to each other ) puts @entity4 in a very small group of @entity47 cities			1
the shape of today 's research university , with its heavy dependence on federally sponsored research , can be traced to @entity69 and its immediate aftermath , with a major boost a decade later when the @entity72 launched @entity73			0
but what began as a response to national security threats has turned into the engine of @entity47 's -- and the world 's -- prosperity			0
as my colleague , the @entity82 's @entity81 , @entity80 has written , the industries that have fueled economic growth have come out of the @entity47 research university enterprise			1
biotechnology , nanotechnology , digital communications , and computers and software that have improved our quality of life and economic standing all have their origins in research universities			1
the companies that apply this research create jobs and fuel economic growth and wealth generation in ways that the world has never before experienced			1
according to one report prepared for the @entity111 , 50 percent of the growth in the @entity47 economy in the last 40 years has been due to investments in research and development			2
obviously , the private sector is a major driver of r&d , but federally funded research at universities throughout the @entity47 plays a key role			1
the presence of a major research university does not , by itself , guarantee economic progress beyond the direct jobs that the university creates			2
realizing the full potential of a university depends on effectively tapping into the brilliance and ingenuity of its faculty and students and the innovations they create			0
technology commercialization -- shaping a bright idea into a commercially successful product -- has been described as a " contact sport "			0
it requires an innovative and entrepreneurial campus culture and an ecosystem surrounding it that supports technology - based economic development with facilities , money and people who know how to take ideas to the market			0
more than a decade ago , @entity3 embraced @entity4 's economic development as one of its institutional strategic priorities			1
we changed our technology transfer policies to make it easier and faster for our faculty and alumni to create local companies based on our technology			0
we joined forces with the @entity58 and partnered with state and local government and industry to strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem on which we all rely			0
today , there are more than 200 @entity4 companies commercializing @entity3 technology			2
our economic development efforts have also included company attraction			0
with state and local government support , we built a building on campus for global technology companies , which see value in being so close to our faculty and students			0
there are now hundreds of new jobs in that building , created by @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182			0
@entity183 set up their first research lab here , but they 're across the street -- the new building is full			0
the success of the @entity47 research university has been , and continues to be , studied by many developing and developed countries that want to advance technology , secure a stronger position for themselves in global markets and raise the standard of living for their citizens			0
it is clear that the @entity47 model must be replicated in many countries in order for the world to be a better place			0
during the last decade , in pursuit of another of our strategic priorities , @entity3 has partnered with several countries , including @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 , among others , to establish high - caliber education and research programs			2
countries that can successfully replicate the @entity47 research university enterprise will secure for themselves a strong position for the future , for they will be the source of the next wave of economic expansion in the world			2
we are living in one of the most intellectually exciting eras in history			0
from medicine to energy , to robotics and computing , many fields of science are experiencing a revolution that will change our understanding of what is possible			0
these revolutions are occurring on the campuses and laboratories of research universities every day around the world			2
as world leaders arrive here in @entity4 , they must keep in mind the importance of research and education , historically and in addressing today 's most challenging issues			1
as they contemplate stimulus plans and regulation of the financial industry , and enjoy @entity4 's beauty and impressive progress , they must also resolve to sustain and , in most countries , grow their systems of higher education , including and especially their research universities			1
research universities are at the heart of @entity4 's transformation , and they are a key to our collective future			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity4 economy has been *reinvented* through innovation
he says universities have played a key role in economic revival
he says @entity17 meeting focuses attention on role of universities
@entity283 : @entity284 must focus on key role of education and research
