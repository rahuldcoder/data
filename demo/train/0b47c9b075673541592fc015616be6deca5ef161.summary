a @entity1 judge issued international arrest warrants monday for @entity6 's former president @entity5 and former prime minister @entity7 for alleged genocide against the people of @entity10 , @entity1 's @entity0 in @entity2 said			1
the warrants against them and three other senior @entity6 officials are the latest chapter in a long - running lawsuit by pro-tibetan groups and a dual @entity18 - @entity1 citizen who seek international legal action against some @entity6 officials			1
judge @entity21 issued the arrest warrants for alleged " genocide , torture and crimes against humanity , " and ordered them to be sent to @entity27 , the international police agency , according to a copy of the order viewed by @entity30			0
the former officials will surely not be arrested in @entity6 , but there 's a " medium chance " of them being arrested if they go abroad , " depending on the country and its ethics , " said @entity36 , president of the @entity38 - based @entity37			1
@entity36 expressed satisfaction with the judge 's order , which his group has been pushing with its co-plaintiffs : the @entity44 and @entity45 , a @entity18 who has lived in @entity1 for about 20 years and has @entity1 citizenship			2
" it shows that justice after all works , against all odds			0
if you let justice work , victims can have retribution , " @entity36 said			0
the arrest warrants came on the eve of a debate in @entity1 parliament , on tuesday , that reportedly could restrict the use of the universal justice principle in @entity1 courts			2
it holds that if human rights abuses are n't addressed in the country where they occurred , a separate country -- in this case , @entity1 -- has the right to seek legal action			1
@entity1 courts have applied the principle in trying to seek justice for abuses committed under some former @entity75 military regimes , but some foreign governments have complained about @entity1 courts meddling in their affairs			2
repeated phone calls to the @entity80 in @entity2 went unanswered			0
on tuesday , @entity81 , @entity6 's @entity82 spokesperson , said that @entity83 was " strongly dissatisfied " and " firmly opposed to the erroneous acts " taken by @entity1 agencies .			0

former president @entity5 , former prime minister @entity7 are *accused* of genocide
warrants against them and three other officials are the latest in a suit by @entity94 groups
@entity37 chief : there 's a chance they *'ll* be arrested if they go abroad
warrants come just before @entity1 debates seeking justice for foreign human rights abuses
