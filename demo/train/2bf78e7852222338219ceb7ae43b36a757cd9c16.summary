-- four members of @entity6 's fabled marching 100 band have been arrested on hazing charges , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 college said friday			1
the charges are unrelated to the november hazing death of drum major @entity10			1
@entity6 police arrested three of the students thursday night ; the fourth turned himself in friday morning , said @entity14 , the @entity6 spokeswoman			2
the students -- @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 -- were charged with hazing five @entity20 band members who wanted to join a group in the clarinet section known as the " clones			1
" the five told police they were made to line up according to height at the start of each meeting			0
then they were punched , slapped and paddled , according to the arrest warrant			0
one of the students , who quit the pledging process after the first meeting , took a digital photo of the bruising on her body			0
the initiation meetings , which began last september , took place at the home of @entity15 and @entity16 , the warrant said			0
champion 's death prompted @entity6 's board of trustees to approve a three - part plan to tackle the issue of hazing on campus			1
the plan includes an independent blue - ribbon panel of experts to investigate			0
trustee @entity49 told board members the panel would take a " forward - looking " approach at hazing on campus , and would not conflict with any current investigations into the @entity20 band			1
champion , 26 , collapsed in @entity56 on a bus carrying members of the band after a november football game that included a halftime performance by the group			1
@entity62 , a lawyer for @entity55 's family , has charged that @entity55 died after receiving " some dramatic blows , perhaps ( having an ) elevated heart rate " tied to " a hazing ritual " that took place on the bus			1
some band members have said @entity55 died after taking part in a rite of passage called " crossing @entity73 " one member , who spoke on condition of anonymity , explained that students " walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members , and you get beaten until you get to the back			2
" no one has been charged in @entity55 's death ; the @entity88 and the @entity89 are investigating the case			1
the @entity88 also launched a separate investigation into band employees , who were allegedly engaged in financial fraud			0
the medical examiner 's office has said champion " collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body			2
" an autopsy conducted after his death found " extensive contusions of his chest , arms , shoulder and back , " as well as " evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat , " which is the fatty tissue directly under a person 's skin			2
an attorney for the band 's director , on paid administrative leave since shortly after @entity55 's death , said his client issued letters of suspension and withheld scholarships " of all students whose names were provided to him once the incident was reported			1
" @entity128 also informed campus police , attorney @entity127 said in a written statement			0
" dr. @entity128 applauds the efforts of law enforcement to arrest individuals that he suspended for hazing and hopes that they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , " according to the statement			0
" dr. @entity128 has been the leading anti-hazing advocate on the @entity6 campus for years and his legal team continues to call upon president @entity140 to fully reinstate him to his position since the original reason for termination -- failure to report hazing -- is clearly unfounded by the record evidence			0
" @entity128 originally had been suspended with termination scheduled for december 22 , but he was subsequently placed on leave until completion of the investigation into @entity55 's death			2
@entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

new : the band director 's attorney again calls for reinstatement
the arrests are not related to the november hazing death of @entity10
they four students are charged with hazing those who wanted to join a clarinet group
the college is looking into how best to address hazing *problems*
