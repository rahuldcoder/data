@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been 48 hours since college student @entity4 was stunned with a taser during a forum with sen. @entity8 , and some students are still in shock over what happened			1
@entity13 student @entity12 took this photo of tuesday 's student protest			1
but other students at the @entity13 are already tired of hearing about it			1
while about 350 students protested the incident tuesday , the opinions on campus seem to be evenly divided over whether the officers acted properly			1
on the popular online networking web site @entity26 , students from around the nation have already created more than 80 groups discussing what happened monday			1
even among those groups , the count is almost split between the number who oppose the police 's action and those who support their decision			1
" i was pretty horrified by what happened			2
i was shocked that the people we are supposed to trust would turn against us , " said @entity39 , a freshman who is majoring in psychology			2
this is what i saw at the @entity8 forum on monday : @entity46 , a 21 - year - old telecommunications major , jumped up to the microphone already flanked by @entity49			2
he interrupted another student 's question , and although @entity8 had earlier said he was taking no more questions , he told @entity46 he 'd take his comments next			1
@entity8 asked the police to allow @entity46 to speak			1
when it was his turn , @entity46 first asked about the 2004 presidential election and followed with statements about whether president @entity58 should be impeached			0
at that moment the microphone was turned off and police began to take @entity46 out of the auditorium			2
@entity46 then started to struggle with the officers			0
as they pulled him toward the exit , @entity46 broke free and tried to get away			0
at that point , six officers tackled @entity46 to the ground and told him to roll over			0
he continued to yell for help and a female officer warned @entity46 if he did not stop he would be tased			0
he kept yelling and one of the other officers gave the order to tase him			0
the audience remained seated and watching the confrontation until they heard the loud zap of the @entity77			1
then several people at the event started yelling at the officers			0
" i was startled by the noise , considering what was happening in front of me			0
and after they tasered him there was a stench that was not overpowering but it was unsettling , " said @entity85 , a @entity13 graduate student			1
the videotape of @entity46 screaming as he was shocked quickly got the attention of news services and became a @entity95 hit			0
campus rumors now circulate that @entity46 , known as being a prankster , was simply trying to be obnoxious and get attention at the @entity8 speech			2
@entity46 spent a night in jail on charges of disturbing the peace and resisting an officer			0
later , the school 's president , @entity104 , said two police officers involved were placed on administrative leave			2
since the incident , @entity46 has kept a low profile			0
but other students have n't been so quiet , with tuesday 's rally protesting what the students ' claimed was a case of police brutality and another rally being planned			1
" i am glad that we are starting a civil discourse debate , because this is a subject that needs to be addressed , " @entity85 said			0

about 350 students protest police use of @entity77 on student
campus seems evenly divided on whether police acted *correctly*
case is the talk of the @entity13
