-- @entity1 will sometimes say " no " and the world should get used to it			2
that message came through last weekend when @entity1 , one of five permanent @entity7 members , joined @entity8 in blocking action on @entity10			1
their vetoes derailed a draft resolution condemning @entity10 president @entity15 's 11 - month - old attempt to crush opposition groups and demanding an end to attacks on peaceful protesters			1
" do not mistakenly think that because @entity1 takes a careful and responsible position on this [ @entity10 ] issue , @entity1 will not use its veto power or will always abstain , " said @entity20 , @entity1 's vice foreign minister			1
" when @entity1 must use its veto power , it will surely use it			2
" on saturday , @entity25 , the @entity26 ambassador to the @entity27 , called the vetoes " disgusting and shameful			0
" " those that have blocked potentially the last effort to resolve this peacefully ... will have any future blood spill on their hands , " she said after the voting			0
but @entity20 said there is nothing unusual for the five permanent members of the @entity7 to disagree on certain issues			2
speaking at a press briefing thursday on the eve of a visit to the @entity26 by @entity44 , the @entity1 vice president , @entity20 said @entity26 's displeasure over @entity1 's veto will not affect @entity1 - @entity26 cooperation on other international issues			1
in @entity1 , the veto was hailed by local media as a significant change in @entity53 's diplomatic tack			1
" abstaining is no longer always a choice as @entity1 is forced to speak out , " according to an editorial in the state - run @entity57 , an official english - language daily			2
" @entity1 needs to speak out			0
hiding its true thinking does not help avoid trouble			0
" the @entity57 said @entity1 's veto does not indicate a @entity1 - @entity8 alliance			1
" both @entity1 and @entity8 have their own interests and dignity , " it added			1
@entity66 , director of african studies at the @entity67 said the veto shows @entity1 's confidence in foreign affairs			1
" a country expressing its true opinion -- that 's progress , " he said			0
so why did @entity1 use its veto this time ? " @entity1 opposes the use of threat or force to achieve regime change in other countries , " said @entity66			1
" this is consistent with @entity1 's long - standing diplomacy principle			1
it is also not acceptable for @entity1 to rush a [ @entity27 ] vote without sufficient consultation			0
" @entity1 , she added , does not wish see a reprise of what she considers a debacle over @entity90			0
" on @entity90 , @entity91 misused the rights given by the @entity27 resolution about setting up the no - fly zone , which was then turned into ' regime change ' in @entity90 , " she said			0
@entity97 , a senior researcher at the @entity98 , agreed : " what concerns @entity1 most is possible regime change and foreign military intervention , " he said			2
" we ask the international community to give more space and time for dialogue within @entity10			0
" on february 6 , the state - run @entity106 wrote in an editorial : " it is @entity10 people 's democratic right to choose a government they want			2
but hatred and separatists will remain a challenge no matter who is ruling , the government has to stabilize the country and protect people 's safety			0
it will still come down to the problem of peace among nations and tribes			0
" @entity1 is ranked as the third - largest supplier of imports to @entity10 in 2010 , according to data from the @entity128			1
but local experts downplay the scale of @entity1 's stakes and national interests in @entity10			1
" compared with @entity8 , @entity1 does not have that much interest in @entity10 and in the @entity134 , " @entity66 said			1
" of course , in the greater @entity134 , we need and we depend on the energy , say , the oil coming from the region			0
" @entity139 , a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity140 , rejected criticisms of @entity1 's veto			1
" @entity1 does not have its own selfish interest on the issue of @entity10 , " he said in a news conference			2
" we do not deliberately shelter or oppose any country			0
instead , we uphold justice in dealing with the issue			0
" but @entity1 's critics say @entity1 's veto of the @entity27 draft resolution was in part due to @entity53 's fear that allowing a regime change in @entity10 could encourage the spread of the @entity157 revolution and eventually threaten @entity1			1
" in my opinion , more than 99 % of @entity1 do not want to see an @entity161 revolution in @entity1 , and they do not believe that there will be one in @entity1 , " she says			0
" @entity1 has a completely different political system and economic development path			2
if someone in the international community thinks that the @entity161 will happen in @entity1 , then i think they misjudge the situation in @entity1 , exaggerate some problems in the @entity1 society and underestimate the ability of the @entity1 government to control the situation in @entity1			0
" as to ambassador @entity25 's blunt reaction to @entity1 's and @entity8 's vetoes , @entity66 quips : " i think the statement shows utter lack of diplomatic protocol			1
the statement itself is disgusting			0

@entity1 joined @entity8 in using its veto to block a @entity7 draft resolution on @entity10
@entity1 's use of veto marks a significant change in @entity53 's diplomatic tack , local media says
some *analysts* say the move shows @entity53 's fear that political *upheaval* will spread to @entity1
