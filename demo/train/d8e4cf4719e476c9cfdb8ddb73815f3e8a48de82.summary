-- a college degree can be an important gateway to employment , a career and a better standard of living			1
but a college degree does not equate to someone 's level of intelligence or talent			1
for those seeking the best workers or leaders , there is a plethora of intelligent , inventive people without degrees who should not be overlooked			1
recognizing this does not negate the importance of a college education -- the intellectual knowledge , access to a wide array of subjects and experience gained on a college campus can be transformative			2
studies demonstrate clearly that without a college degree , you will likely earn less , be more liable to be unemployed and have fewer opportunities for career advancement			1
the challenge is that access to college has become more limited			2
at a time when degrees are so important to income potential , they are going increasingly to privileged and affluent young people			1
as the 2010 book " @entity44 " points out , among those who scored in the highest quartile of a national standardized test , those from affluent families were twice as likely to attend college as those from poorer families			1
so a lot of talent goes unrecognized and undeveloped			2
and those without college degrees are n't necessarily less driven or intelligent than those with degrees			1
@entity56 , author of " @entity57 , " argued in the @entity58 recently that the skills of entrepreneurs are not learned " crouched over a desk studying for multiple - choice exams			0
" indeed , years ago @entity63 created a research - based entrepreneurship test that deducts a substantial number of points if you were a high achiever in school			0
this is what we have found at @entity73 over the past two decades			0
we have worked with thousands of young adults without college degrees and have seen many achieve incredible success ( with many eventually completing degrees )			1
we 've seen a single mom in community college become a @entity81 lawyer , a former gang member create a youth development organization and a woman raised in foster care work for a foundation reforming foster care systems			2
i share these and many other stories in my book , " @entity88			0
" when we equate talent , competence and character with credentials , we block a lot of superstar leaders our businesses , communities and country need			1
here are examples of other superstars who did not complete college on their rise to the top : -- we all know the story of @entity108 , who dropped out of @entity109			2
since the days of @entity111 and @entity112 , many business leaders got their starts without the benefit of degrees , including @entity116 of @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 of @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 of @entity123 , @entity124 of @entity125 , @entity126 of @entity127 , @entity128 of @entity129 , @entity130 of @entity131 , @entity132 of @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			1
-- @entity137 , senior advisor to president @entity138 and architect of his innovative and historically unprecedented campaign , dropped out of the @entity141 to work in politics ( returning to complete his degree in 2010 )			1
president @entity145 's top adviser , @entity146 , and @entity148 's 2008 campaign manager , @entity149 , also lacked degrees			1
-- @entity151 , the governor of @entity152 , dropped out of @entity153			0
he is joined by gov. @entity154 of @entity155 , gov. @entity156 of @entity157 , @entity159 sen. @entity158 of @entity160 and 33 members of the @entity159 @entity162			0
-- @entity163 has received many honorary doctorates but never attended college to learn her craft			2
she 's in good company with many other great @entity159 writers , such as @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity174 @entity173 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			2
-- @entity178 is loved by intellectuals for his philosophical films , but he did not gain his style on a campus , having flunked out of @entity183			0
other @entity185 winners without degrees include @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 ( who completed a degree in 2002 )			1
-- @entity198 left @entity199 in 1976 to begin her career in media ( completing her degree in 1986 )			0
top talkers without degrees include @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and conservative talkers @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			0
-- @entity214 attended three schools and completed 18 undergraduate credits before working his way to @entity219 anchor			0
@entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 were also anchors without degrees			0
and many reporters and columnists never completed college , including @entity227 of @entity228 , @entity229 of the @entity230 and former @entity58 columnist and wordsmith @entity232			0
-- @entity233 has made a name for herself as a singer , songwriter and political activist			0
she joins an exclusive club of singer / activists without degrees that includes @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			0
the point of this list is not to disparage higher education -- it is still the best pathway to success			0
but imagine if venture capitalists had denied @entity108 or @entity118 support because their resumes lacked a diploma , or if producers had denied @entity198 a television show because she had not completed her degree			0
we need to make college more accessible to smart people from all backgrounds , while also being careful not to judge talent , character or competence primarily by higher education credentials			1
our nation should be a ladder of opportunity for the best talent , regardless of background			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity273 .			2
