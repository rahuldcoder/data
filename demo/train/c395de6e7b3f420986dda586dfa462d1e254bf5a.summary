@entity0 -- @entity2 , who has died in @entity0 aged 88 , was an inspiration to all of us who wanted to make the world a more peaceful and more equal place			1
he came from a privileged and political family , his father and grandfather both @entity11 , and he would have become lord @entity12 in the early 1960s if he had not fought to renounce his hereditary peerage			1
luckily he won , stayed an mp instead of mouldering in @entity16 's upper @entity15 for the next five decades , and dedicated his life to socialist ideas and most importantly to campaigning for change			1
@entity2 was born in the aftermath of @entity21 he was an airman in @entity22 , and often talked about his experience			1
he lost a brother in that war , but also saw it as a watershed , marking no return to the unemployment and fascism of the 1930s			2
as he said , the young conscripted troops became radicalized by the war , arguing that if there could be full employment in wartime , so there could be full employment in peacetime to build houses , hospitals , schools and all the other things people needed			2
he was @entity46 all his life , campaigning for the 1945 landslide , but in the last part of his life his main activity was outside @entity46 's structures			0
i remember vividly how he used this wartime experience on one occasion			0
just after @entity55 became prime minister , we wanted to hold an anti-war demo going from @entity58 to parliament , but the march was banned by the police			0
i received a phone call from @entity2 to say that he had just dropped a letter off in @entity64 complaining about this decision and promising to defy it			1
sure enough he turned up on the day wearing his @entity22 medals and demanding to march			0
we set off , daring the police to arrest us			0
he quipped that he was leaving parliament in order to spend more time with politics			0
this was after the death of his beloved wife @entity77 , herself a socialist campaigner and writer			1
he spent the rest of his life campaigning for a range of causes , but above all he was identified with the @entity88 , of which i became the convenor when we launched it in 2001			0
he campaigned and spoke at every demo , travelled round the country to hold rapturous and well - attended meetings , and became president of the campaign , a post he held up to his death			2
he was opposed to the wars the @entity16 government and its @entity102 allies were waging , including the latest attempt to start another war on @entity105 last summer			1
he also helped campaign against austerity , most recently through the @entity108			0
@entity2 was polite , disciplined , hard working , political : all the things you could wish for in a campaigner			1
he was a delight to talk to , interested always in ideas , technological change , history , and building broad united campaigns			2
one of the last conversation i had with him he stressed the importance of organizing , and wanted may 1 , the international day of working class struggle , to be marked into 2014 as a day to rise up against austerity			2
that is an invitation i hope millions of people will take up			0
maybe we could call it @entity2 day			1
that would be a fitting legacy			0
