an @entity2 explorer 's claim to have found the long - lost @entity3 , @entity5 ' flagship from his first voyage to the @entity7 , has been dismissed by a group of @entity10 experts			1
underwater explorer @entity11 made headlines when he said in may that he believed a shipwreck on a reef off @entity17 's northern coast could be the fabled ship , which went down in 1492			1
but a team from the @entity10 cultural agency @entity20 said in a report monday that bronze or copper fasteners found at the site point to shipbuilding techniques of the late 17th or 18th centuries , when ships were covered in copper			1
before that , fasteners were made only of wood or iron , it said			2
" there is now incontestable proof that the wreck is from a much later period , " according to the report by mission leader @entity39 , who visited the site for several days beginning september 9			0
the experts also believe that contemporary accounts , including @entity5 ' own journal , indicate that the wreck is too far from the shore to be that of the @entity3			1
the @entity20 mission was requested by the @entity17 government to check out @entity11 's claim to have solved a 500 - year - old mystery			2
@entity11 told @entity51 in may that he was " very confident " that his team had discovered the wreck of a ship he described as having " changed the course of human history			0
" he believed the site had been looted since he first uncovered it in 2003			0
the @entity3 was the flagship of @entity5 ' small fleet that set sail from @entity61 in august 1492 under the sponsorship of @entity63 and queen @entity64 the voyage aimed to find a westward route to @entity67 , @entity68 and the gold and spice islands of the @entity71			1
but the land the sailors set eyes on in october 1492 was an island in the @entity76			0
among the islands on which @entity5 set foot was @entity79 , which is divided between @entity17 and the @entity81			2
@entity5 established a fort in @entity17			2
that december , the @entity3 accidentally ran aground off the island 's coast			0
some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship , which was about 117 feet ( 36 meters ) long , were used by the garrison at the fort , according to @entity90			0
@entity5 set off back to @entity61 with the two remaining ships , the @entity92 and the @entity93 , in january 1493			0
the @entity20 report called for further investigations to find the @entity3 and urged @entity17 to take steps to ensure that its underwater heritage is protected in line with @entity10 conventions .			1

@entity10 experts say a wreck found off @entity17 is not that of the long - lost @entity3
an @entity2 explorer said in may he believed he *'d* found @entity5 ' flagship
but @entity20 says that bronze or copper fasteners at the site indicate it was a later wreck
the @entity3 foundered in 1492 as @entity5 made his first voyage to the @entity7
