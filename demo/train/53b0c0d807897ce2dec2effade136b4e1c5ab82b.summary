@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 portray themselves as the party of family values			0
yet , in @entity8 , one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud			0
you do n't get to choose your family			0
still , family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones			0
they make others uncomfortable , and hurt those who love them			0
these people are often thinking only of themselves , and they have n't considered the consequences of their behavior			0
@entity23 is one of these people			1
and the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician			0
the @entity3 @entity28 candidate from @entity8 is running to the right of @entity3 incumbent sen. @entity30			1
and because that might not be so easy to do , whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic , it 's difficult to know if she 's speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator			2
an independent political group calling itself the @entity39 , which is defending @entity30 , recently launched an ad attacking @entity41 for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage and supporting the decision of the @entity45 to give benefits to same - sex partners of employees			1
@entity41 sisters spar over same - sex marriage , parents weigh in this week , while calling on @entity30 to denounce the ad and labeling it " gutter politics , " @entity41 stood by those earlier positions			1
during an interview on " @entity57 , " she said : " i do n't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation			0
if people are in a same - sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance , there 's no reason we should n't do that			1
" nonetheless , that ad puts @entity41 in a tight spot , and given that @entity8 is a very conservative state and given that she 's trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum , she ca n't be seen as soft on same - sex marriage			1
thus , in the same interview , she made clear that she does n't favor allowing same - sex couples to wed and that she supports " the traditional definition of marriage			1
" it 's a position that @entity41 has long held			1
that is part of the problem			0
in a country where , as public opinion polls make clear , the opinion of so many @entity88 on same - sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young @entity88 consider this a nonissue , it would have been good to see some personal growth from @entity41			1
besides , she should tread lightly on this subject			0
why ? because blood is thicker than votes			0
and because @entity105 was right , and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you " do n't ever take sides with anyone against the family			0
" and , for the @entity41 family , this issue is personal			1
@entity23 's sister , @entity108 , is in a same - sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion , @entity113			1
" i love @entity108 very much			0
i love her family very much			0
this is just an issue in which we disagree , " @entity41 said on " @entity57			1
" @entity119 was n't having any of it			0
not long after the interview , she posted this rebuttal on @entity123 : " @entity23 -- this is n't just an issue on which we disagree -- you 're just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history			1
" @entity108 also shared a post by @entity113 , who was likewise bothered by @entity23 's comments			1
it read : " i was watching my sister - in - law on @entity57 ( yes @entity23 , in fifteen states and the @entity135 you are my sister - in - law ) and was very disappointed to hear her say ' i do believe in the traditional definition of marriage ...			1
" @entity23 has been a guest in our home , has spent time and shared holidays with our children , and when @entity108 and i got married in 2012 -- she did n't hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us			1
" to have her now say she does n't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least			0
" here is what @entity23 missed : to many proponents of marriage equality , the very idea of " traditional marriage " is offensive			1
you see , tradition is the antithesis of progress			0
it was once tradition that women did n't have the right to vote , and african - americans used separate restrooms , and @entity88 - born @entity160 - @entity88 were swept up in immigration sweeps			2
those things had to change , and they did			2
in those instances , @entity88 decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness , justice and equality			0
this year , @entity171 dinner at the @entity41 house is bound to be awkward			1
the kids are fighting , and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all			0
" this is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years , and we are pained to see it become public , " vice president @entity41 and his wife , @entity178 , said monday in a statement			1
they insisted that @entity23 has " always treated her sister and her sister 's family with love and respect , exactly as she should have done			1
" and , they said , " compassion is called for , even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter			0
" the @entity195 know something about compassion			0
over the years , they have been remarkably graceful and supportive toward @entity119 and her family			0
@entity41 has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that -- despite calls for a federal ban on same - sex marriage -- the issue should be handled at the state level			1
i know something about what @entity23 is going through			1
as recently as 14 years ago , i was opposed to same - sex marriage and supported the watered - down alternative : civil unions			1
i thought this was a battle that was n't worth fighting and that gay activists should focus their attention elsewhere			2
however , my younger brother , who is gay , would n't let me get away with it			2
he told me i was wrong			2
he forced me to be a better person			0
i changed my view , and came to understand that @entity88 ca n't have a two - tiered system , where some of us enjoy the right to marry the people we love while our brothers and sisters and cousins are denied that right , based on nothing more than sexual orientation			2
it 's discrimination with all its ugliness			2
in the end , this is where we should arrive			0
not just because you love your brother , or your sister , but because , just as importantly , you love your country			2
and you understand what @entity88 stands for above all else : freedom			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			2

@entity23 , running for @entity28 , *declared* *opposition* to same - sex marriage
@entity41 's sister , who is in a same - sex marriage , says @entity23 is on the wrong side of history
@entity248 : @entity23 should recognize that same - sex marriage is about freedom
he says his brother , who is gay , *persuaded* him to change his view on marriage
