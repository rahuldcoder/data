editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published this fall by @entity10			0
@entity2 writes widely about current events			1
@entity14 says @entity15 is a case of government playing a positive role in health care			1
@entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- health care reform has gotten off track			1
the president 's news conference fell flat			0
polls show growing unease with the proposals currently in play			0
and @entity31 will not meet the deadline that president @entity33 imposed			0
the status quo , as the president correctly explained to reporters , is not sustainable			0
our health care system is not working			1
millions of people lack insurance , costs are out of control , businesses and workers are struggling to keep up with premiums , and there are tremendous inefficiencies plaguing many parts of the system			2
conditions will only become worse in coming years			0
our health care system brings to mind the economist @entity52 's famous maxim : " when something ca n't go on forever , it will stop			1
" when @entity31 returns in september , @entity33 will only be able to revitalize the prospects for health care reform if he offers @entity56 a stronger argument about what government can do to improve this situation			1
after years of being in the opposition , democrats are still scared about defending the value of government			1
their political nerves have been exacerbated by polls showing the public is growing increasingly concerned about the size of government spending			2
this reticence about government , in the aftermath of the @entity60 ' dramatic 2008 election victory , has been one of the most striking aspects of the administration 's rhetoric in the past few months			2
before the 1970s , @entity60 were full of confidence when pushing for federal programs			0
indeed , 44 years ago this week , on july 30 , 1965 , president @entity79 signed the legislation that created @entity15 and @entity81			1
the event took place at @entity85 's presidential library in @entity86 , @entity87			0
sitting beside the 81 - year - old former president , @entity79 announced : " no longer will older @entity56 be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine			1
no longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years			0
before @entity15 started , only about 50 percent of @entity56 who were 65 or older possessed hospital coverage			1
within five years of the program 's creation , 97 percent of the elderly had hospital coverage			2
the same changes occurred with physician 's coverage			0
today , more than 40 million elderly @entity56 rely on the program -- as do their families who do n't have to take responsibility for these costs			1
besides expanding coverage , @entity15 has become instrumental to the health care industry			1
for all the complaints that we hear about @entity15 , the reality is that most hospitals and doctors have come to depend on these federal payments into their system			2
those who want to keep government " out " of the industry rarely acknowledge that government is already " in			2
" while doctors were at the forefront of the campaign against @entity15 , they turned out to be among the program 's biggest beneficiaries			1
as political scientist @entity129 told @entity130 about the industry , " if they 'd known how well they were going to do , they would n't have spent all those years opposing it			0
they would have said , ' please pass this			0
' " @entity15 has also been able to accomplish the impossible : compel hospitals to change the way in which they charge for care			1
while policymakers had originally allowed hospitals to charge " reasonable costs " to the program , reforms in 1983 created the @entity144			0
rather than paying hospitals for each patient they took care of , @entity15 paid hospitals a fixed amount of money			1
the change resulted in significant cost reductions			0
most recently , in @entity152 , state policymakers have observed that the existence of a strong government program has created an opportunity to achieve such cost measures at the state level			1
and finally , @entity15 has proven to be more popular than private insurance programs			1
so , for all the talk about hating big government , the big government seems to be doing something right , according to numerous polls			0
according to a @entity166 poll , 68 percent of respondents said they believed the @entity15 program would put " your interests above their own " compared to 48 percent for private insurance			1
the @entity172 reported that more than 70 percent of @entity15 fee - for - service recipients were satisfied with their access to care , in contrast to those on private insurance , where only 51 percent felt they could always obtain what they needed			1
certainly , @entity15 has been far from perfect			2
the program has not been good at innovation			0
when @entity31 added catastrophic medical coverage to @entity15 in 1988 , legislators were forced to retreat and repeal the plan in 1989 after encountering a political backlash			2
@entity31 added prescription drug benefits to @entity15 , but not until 2003			2
@entity15 has also become an enormously expensive part of the federal budget , requiring significant increases in payroll taxes while squeezing discretionary spending for other policies			2
all in all , however , @entity15 has done pretty well for this country			2
it remains the best argument president @entity33 can make in response to his critics			0
of course , arguments were not all that @entity79 relied on			0
@entity79 was willing to make key compromises on the legislation , such as originally allowing hospitals to determine charges and sitting back as @entity205 chairman @entity204 -- who had opposed the proposal for several years -- redrafted the measure in the final weeks and then publicly claimed credit for the outcome			0
@entity79 was also willing to strong - arm members of his own party who were on the fence about the bill			0
but in the end , the key to @entity15 was not politicking but a compelling belief that government could play a positive role in this country and in our health care system			1
as policymakers enter into the final rounds of this debate , they would do well to look carefully at the program that @entity79 signed into law in july 1965 and see just what @entity229 , despite all the knocks it takes , can provide			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity14 .			0

@entity2 : democrats nervous about expanding government role in health care
he says @entity15 is a strong case of government positively *affecting* health care
he says recipients rate @entity15 more *highly* than private insurance
@entity2 : today 40 million @entity56 rely on the program , along with their families
