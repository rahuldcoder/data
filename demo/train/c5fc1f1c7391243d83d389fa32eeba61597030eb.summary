@entity0 -- president @entity2 asked @entity3 friday for more power to streamline and reorganize the federal government , a move designed to claim the political middle ground in an election likely to be dominated by questions about @entity0 's role in the economy			1
the president asked legislators to grant him the authority to merge agencies that perform similar functions			0
if that power is granted , @entity3 would be required to hold an up - or - down vote on the president 's streamlining plan within 90 days of its submission			1
among other things , the president 's plan would combine several agencies that focus on commerce and trade , including the @entity28 , the @entity29 , the @entity30 , the @entity31 and the @entity32			1
under the move , the @entity33 as currently constituted would be eliminated			1
some of its responsibilities would be shifted to a new department yet to be named , while other functions would be shifted elsewhere			0
in the meantime , the president is elevating the @entity28 to a cabinet - level agency -- a largely symbolic move that does not require congressional approval			1
" no business or nonprofit leader would allow this kind of duplication or unnecessary complexity in their operations , " @entity2 told a group of business leaders and administration officials at the @entity47			1
" so why is it ok for our government ? it 's not			2
" the proposal is designed initially to save up to $ 3 billion over the next decade , partly by cutting up to 2,000 jobs through attrition , according to the administration			1
@entity2 noted friday that presidents starting in the midst of the @entity66 were authorized to submit federal reorganization plans to @entity3 for a guaranteed up - or - down vote			1
that authority , however , expired in 1984			0
" when this process was left to follow the usual @entity3 pace , not surprisingly , it slowed down , " @entity2 said			2
" congressional committees fought to protect their turf			0
lobbyists fought to keep things unchanged because they 're the only ones who can navigate the bureaucracy			0
and because it 's always easier to add than to subtract in @entity0 , inertia prevented any real reform from happening			0
" @entity2 's plan -- building on a promise made in last year 's @entity85 address to streamline government -- could help to place the president in a more centrist position heading into the election , political analysts note			1
it could also put congressional @entity91 in a politically awkward position by forcing them to either accept the plan -- thereby handing @entity2 a political win -- or reject it and risk ceding a core conservative issue to the president			1
" president @entity2 is trying to counter the perception that he is a big - government liberal , " said @entity98 , @entity1 polling director			1
" if he gets his way and can brag about reorganizing the government , that may help him in the fall			0
" on the other hand , @entity98 noted , " when then - vice president @entity108 was put in charge of a ' @entity114 ' initiative under @entity115 , it did n't seem to affect views of @entity108 in that regard , possibly because few @entity110 really noticed			0
" skeptical republicans questioned both the merit and the timing of @entity2 's announcement			2
" given the president 's record of growing government , we 're interested to learn whether this proposal represents actual relief for @entity110 businesses or just the appearance of it , " said @entity120 , a spokesman for @entity47 speaker @entity121 , @entity122			1
" @entity110 small businesses are more concerned about this administration 's policies than from which building in @entity0 they originate			0
we hope the president is n't simply proposing new packaging for the same burdensome approach			0
" @entity137 , a spokesman for @entity139 minority leader @entity138 , @entity140 , said that " after presiding over one of the largest expansions of government in history , and a year after raising the issue ... it 's interesting to see the president finally acknowledge that @entity0 is out of control			2
" republicans frequently cite the rapid growth in deficit spending over the last three years as an example of explosive government growth under @entity2			1
@entity154 insist such spending was necessary to prevent a deeper economic downturn			0
@entity158 rep. @entity157 , the @entity91 chairman of the @entity159 , criticized the administration for allegedly not working more closely with @entity3 on earlier reorganization efforts			2
" i stand ready to work with president @entity2 on proposals to reorganize federal agencies , " @entity157 said in a written statement			2
" while i have been disappointed that the @entity47 has not embraced earlier bipartisan congressional efforts seeking collaborative engagement on proposals to reorganize government , i hope this announcement represents the beginning of a sincere and dedicated effort to enact meaningful reforms			0
" @entity157 noted a letter sent last march from several congressmen to the @entity47 seeking " a tentative timeline for development and implementation of ( a ) reorganization proposal			0
" @entity1 's @entity180 contributed to this report			0
