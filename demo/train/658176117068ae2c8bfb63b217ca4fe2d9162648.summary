-- as news of the tragic shooting at a school in @entity5 , @entity6 , rippled across the globe , @entity1 found a candle in his home in the @entity11 and lit it in honor of those who died			1
@entity1 , who lives in @entity14 , said he found it " unspeakable " that someone would kill people who could not defend themselves , especially children " who know nothing of violence			2
" " i wanted people to understand that while we may not be @entity25 , we too are parents who care deeply for our children , " the father of two said			1
his heartfelt reaction was typical of many in @entity0 's international community responding to last week 's shooting at @entity32 in @entity5			1
it triggered an outpouring of views from across the world , with many offering condolences to those affected			0
how other countries deal with massacre nightmare from @entity42 to @entity43 , people said they were shocked at the apparent targeting of children and expressed helplessness that they could not do more to stop the violence			1
view from abroad : sorrow , but little hope for @entity25 gun control many were teachers , describing a kinship they felt for those women who died protecting their charges			1
others were parents , saying they wanted to hold their offspring a little closer and reach out to those for whom such contact would no longer be possible			0
" may @entity59 give courage to all families to face it bravely , may the souls of those angels rest in peace , " said @entity58 , an elementary school teacher from @entity43			1
in @entity67 , a teacher identifying herself as @entity66 commented : " i send all my love and prayers to the families			0
it is all i can do from so far away , but my heart is now in @entity5 with all the affected people			1
" and in @entity42 , @entity76 said he could barely read the news reports for crying			1
" i also have a girl of 6 , and i just imagine she could have been there , " he said			0
" we used to travel to the @entity25 and wanted ( her ) to stay for school			1
" there are few parts of the world left unscarred by mass shootings			0
places such as @entity88 , @entity89 , or @entity90 , @entity91 , conjure images of terror and loss simply from their names			0
' this is what parents in the @entity98 go through every day ' in @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity100 spent hours glued to @entity0 in her home , growing increasingly depressed and sympathetic toward the families left bereft			0
@entity105 , an @entity106 , compared the tragedy to the many children killed in recent violence across the @entity98			0
" the murder of these innocent children living in @entity25 is obviously something very new ( to @entity25 ) , and no one would think in a million years that this could happen in the @entity25 , " she said			1
" ... i guess it 's a wake - up call for @entity25 because they tasted a bit of what the other countries in the @entity98 go through every single day			1
" in grief and with love , from @entity122 inevitably , many questioned @entity25 gun control laws , comparing them with their own countries and finding the @entity25 government wanting when it comes to action			1
@entity129 from @entity122 said she and her husband were so devastated by the news they both sat down and cried			0
" what else would your reaction be ? " @entity129 asked			0
" it does n't matter where you were			0
anyone who heard it had to take a moment to sit down			0
" the pair said they could not help comparing @entity25 gun laws to their situation in @entity122 , where there are strict licensing laws and waiting periods			1
they also felt that the last thing you would do is arm more citizens with lethal weapons			0
" the police or the army -- they are the people that should have guns , " said her husband , @entity154			2
" they need to have 100 % of all people background checked and a waiting period of a week or more so no one can buy a gun on a spur of the moment			2
" @entity169 questions tougher gun control however , others said they felt that guns were not the problem -- just better enforcement of laws and more arming of responsible citizens			1
@entity177 from @entity178 , @entity169 , owns a gun and carries it with him at all times			2
he said he wishes he did n't have to do so but said several years ago his wife had an @entity182 pointed at her during a robbery			0
the incident convinced him that " responsible citizens " with no criminal backgrounds should be armed			0
" @entity187 wo n't stop crazy men from murdering people in schools , " he said , " ( but ) if i was a teacher at that school and i was carrying a weapon , that guy would have been dead			2
" despite differing opinions on how to stop such crimes from being committed , many people said they were united in one thing -- grief for those parents who had lost a child			2
" as a mother of two kids i understand there are no words that can support the poor parents , " said one commenter from @entity202 who identified herself as @entity204			2
" i just want to say that people in @entity202 are crying with you now			2

people from @entity42 to @entity43 express sorrow over killings in @entity5 , @entity6
some say they were shocked over apparent targeting of kids
issue of gun control proves as *divisive* globally as in the @entity25
