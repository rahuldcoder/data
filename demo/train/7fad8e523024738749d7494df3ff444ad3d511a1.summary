-- @entity1 and @entity2 were beginning to get suspicious			0
the staff at @entity4 kept telling them their infant son , @entity6 , was recovering well from surgery			1
there had been a few bumps in the road , to be sure , but they said that was normal for a baby born with a severe heart defect			1
@entity6 remained in the intensive care unit			0
" is everything ok ? " the @entity19 would ask			0
yes , the doctors and nurses assured them			0
then one day , @entity25 says a cardiologist took her aside			0
" she said , ' if i were you , i would move him , ' " @entity25 remembers			0
" she told me we should take him somewhere else			0
' " a few days later , the @entity19 arranged to have @entity6 sent by helicopter to the @entity34			0
by then their son , not quite 3 months old , was in heart failure			2
secret data if @entity39 had been born 30 years ago , he almost surely would have died a few days or weeks after birth			1
he has a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome , which means the left side of his heart is so malformed it ca n't pump blood			2
today , surgeons perform a series of three operations on babies like @entity6			0
they 're high - stakes surgeries -- cutting into an organ the size of a newborn baby 's fist is tricky , to say the least			1
the blood vessels can be thinner than a piece of angel hair pasta , and one wrong move , one nick , one collapsed artery or vein can be deadly			0
these children are medically very fragile , and even the best surgeons lose patients			2
surgeons track their deaths and complications and take great pride in the number of babies they save			2
some are so proud they publish their success rates right on their hospital websites			2
@entity4 @entity4 is not one of these hospitals			0
10 ways to get your child the best heart surgeon instead , @entity81 has gone to great lengths to keep their pediatric heart surgery mortality rates a secret , citing patient privacy			1
reporters and the @entity88 attorney general have asked for the mortality data , and the hospital has declined to give it to them			1
in april , the hospital went to court to keep the mortality rate private			2
parents of babies treated at @entity4 's say the hospital 's effort to keep the data a secret , coupled with troubling events over an eight - week period last year , makes them suspicious something at the hospital has gone terribly wrong			1
four innocent lives on august 30 , @entity105 died after having surgery at @entity81 for hypoplastic left heart syndrome			1
he was 6 months old			0
three weeks later , @entity39 had his surgery and later went into heart failure			1
eleven days after that , newborn @entity110 had a " botched " heart surgery at @entity4 's , according to his father			1
@entity6 and @entity110 both survived after undergoing additional surgeries elsewhere			2
less than three weeks later , on october 16 , 6 - month - old @entity115 died after having heart surgeries at @entity81			1
that same month , dr. @entity117 , the hospital 's chief heart surgeon -- and the only surgeon performing open - heart surgeries at the hospital -- went on paid leave , according to hospital spokesman @entity124 , and the hospital stopped doing heart surgeries			1
the parents say they did n't receive any explanation for why the surgeries stopped or why @entity117 left			1
a hospital spokeswoman said @entity117 was not available for comment			2
parents react to story @entity0 met with @entity105 , @entity6 , and @entity110 's parents in @entity135 , @entity88			1
" i think they 're hiding something , " says @entity136 , @entity105 's mother			2
@entity139 , @entity110 's father , said when his son had the second surgery at a different hospital it lasted four hours longer than expected because of infection and scar tissue left behind from the first surgery at @entity4 's			1
he said the second surgeon also found a hole in @entity110 's heart that the first surgeon missed , and corrected it			1
" our question is , how many other babies did this happen to ? " said @entity110 , who , with his wife @entity150 , started @entity151 to help other patients of children with congenital heart defects			1
a child 's heart surgery amid @entity161 's carnage ' ok is n't good enough for me ' dr. @entity163 is the first to admit his hospital 's heart surgery program was not the best			1
@entity163 is executive vice president for health affairs at the @entity4 's health care system , which includes @entity81			1
he said he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates were n't what he wanted them to be			1
" they were ok , and ok is n't good enough for me , " he said			0
" it 's got to be better			2
it 's got to be good			2
" in december , a local reporter asked for more details			0
@entity177 , who worked for the university - owned radio station , asked the university for the mortality rate for all pediatric cardiothoracic surgeries performed over the past three years			1
she also asked for the number of surgeries performed by @entity117 , the date of his last surgery , and payments received for his surgeries			1
the university answered some of her questions : @entity117 operated on 110 children in 2010 , 81 children in 2011 and 62 in 2012 , often performing multiple surgeries on one child			1
in 2010 , @entity197 received $ 288,522 in payments for his surgeries ; in 2011 , it was $ 255,380			2
but the university refused to release the date of @entity117 's last surgery or the mortality rate , citing the federal patient privacy law known as the @entity205			1
the university 's lawyer said even though @entity177 was only asking for numbers , those numbers could eventually be linked to patients ' names			2
" because dr. @entity117 performs relatively few surgeries and because all of his surgeries are highly complex surgeries , it is relatively easy to deduce the identity of his patients , " wrote @entity212 , the university 's general counsel			1
@entity177 filed an appeal with attorney general @entity222 , citing the state 's @entity223 , which requires that public agencies , such as public universities , open most of their records to the public			2
the attorney general asked the university to let him look at the data privately			2
the university said no , again citing patient privacy laws			0
the attorney general disagreed with the university and found it in violation of the open records law			0
in april , the university appealed the attorney general 's decision to state circuit court			0
hospital plans to do heart surgeries again while the legal battle continues , the @entity245 has been doing its own internal review of the events last year			1
@entity117 returned from his month 's leave of absence and then later resigned from the @entity245 to take a position with the @entity251			1
dr. @entity252 , senior associate dean for clinical affairs at the @entity253 , said he spoke to surgeons who worked with @entity117 in @entity88			0
" they thought dr. @entity117 performed very , very well , " he said			0
" we did the due diligence on his skills , and we think he 'll do excellent in our environment			0
" the @entity88 hospital plans on hiring a new surgeon and opening the program back up again at some point			1
@entity163 , the @entity197 executive , said parents do n't need to worry -- when it reopens , the program will be first class			0
" i wo n't be satisfied until our program is as good as anybody 's program , " he said			0
but @entity105 , @entity110 , and @entity6 's parents are n't so sure			1
they say it 's troubling that doctors and nurses gave them vague answers when they asked specific questions			0
for example , their sons had very complex surgeries , and they wanted to know how many times @entity117 had done their specific procedures and what his success rate had been			0
" i want to know statistics , i want to know hard facts , " said @entity2 , @entity6 's father			0
" but they just said , ' we see this all the time			0
' " @entity163 said he 's not sure parents would understand statistics and rates			1
@entity163 says he worries that most people would " have a hard time understanding data			0
" " data is a complex issue , " he said @entity25 said he and his wife understand data just fine -- they analyzed other hospitals ' mortality rates when deciding where to send @entity6 after the cardiologist suggested he be moved out of @entity4 's			1
@entity110 and @entity6 are both at home now , and their parents are very pleased with the outpatient care from cardiologists at the @entity245			0
but they said they 'll continue to fight to have all safety data released to the public			0
" we 've not lost our child , and i thank @entity313 for that , but i 'm standing up for the ones that have lost their kids -- the moms that i 've had to stand in the hallway with and try to console because they 've lost their children , " @entity25 said			0
" and they do n't know what 's happened and there are still no answers given to them			0
" @entity0 's @entity325 and @entity326 contributed to this report .			0
