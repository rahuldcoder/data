-- @entity1 played in a @entity3 shirt for the first time , but he could not stop his new club falling to an opening day defeat at @entity7			1
@entity8 powered home a near - post header in the 57th minute to ensure a 1 - 0 victory for the @entity13 team and an early blow for @entity16 's desire to wrestle back the @entity18 trophy from neighbors @entity20			1
and @entity7 's victory was no piece of luck			1
it was carved out by a gritty , determined side who tried for every opportunity and won plaudits after the game for defending the lead			2
@entity8 had nearly opened the scoring just seven minutes before , when he fired wide			0
but the second time there was no doubt and he found a gap through the defenders to get it into the center of the net			0
whilst @entity7 seemed to be tiring , they still held their own when @entity3 attacks came			2
new signing @entity41 was sending in a couple of balls for the likes of @entity46 to work with , but nothing came of them			0
@entity1 started the game from the substitutes ' bench , but @entity16 decided to bring on his new striker in the 68th minute as a replacement for @entity54 , who was seemingly running out of ideas to break through a resolute @entity7 defense			1
the former @entity58 player did not waste any time in trying to make a mark on his new team			0
within a minute of coming on , last season 's @entity18 top scorer whipped in a corner kick which required an alert @entity7 back line to sweep clear			2
but after that , @entity7 sat back and frustrated @entity3 's attempts to try and get chances to the new signing			2
and the @entity71 crowd were happy to see them do it			0
the @entity18 was not the only league to see a shock result on monday			0
in @entity77 , newly - promoted @entity76 sent out a strong message on their return to @entity80 by beating last season 's seventh - placed club @entity81 2 - 0			1
two loan players ensured the victory against @entity81			0
@entity86 midfielder @entity85 , who normally plays for @entity87 , struck in the 53rd minute of the game and the second came two minutes into time added on from @entity91 striker @entity90 , who is on loan from @entity93			0
@entity94 left it late before beating @entity96 1 - 0 , with midfielder @entity97 scoring five minutes into added time			1
in @entity100 , @entity99 made light work of their @entity103 first round opponents , beating @entity104 4 - 0 in a @entity106 derby			1
the side , who were recently promoted to the second tier of @entity100 football , managed to hold out for 32 minutes before @entity99 broke the deadlock through new signing @entity112			1
young prospect @entity114 replaced @entity115 just after halftime and scored the second a quarter of an hour after the restart			0
@entity99 then hit @entity119 with the final two goals 10 minutes before time when @entity121 striker @entity112 got his second and the man who replaced him , veteran @entity123 international @entity122 , scored number four in the 88th minute to mark the start of his second spell in @entity127 .			2

@entity7 shock title *hopefuls* by beating @entity16 's side 1 - 0 in their opening game
@entity1 started on substitutes ' bench after his *transfer* from @entity58
newly promoted @entity76 start their @entity80 campaign with a shock 2 - 0 win over @entity81
@entity99 breeze through their first round @entity103 tie with @entity104
