-- while @entity2 sports fans were coming to terms with the news that glamor girl @entity5 would miss the @entity6 , the woman who could again prove to be the nation 's skiing sweetheart was relaxing on a beach			1
@entity11 had been ruled out of a trip to @entity13 by a serious knee injury , and things were n't going well for @entity16 either			1
frustrated by a difficult start to the @entity21 season , the three - time @entity18 medalist had escaped the cold to regroup at her @entity23 hideout			1
while her rivals were fine - tuning their technique on the slopes , she was bedecked in a bikini and plunging into the clear waters that surround @entity29			2
" it 's definitely alternative but it 's what i needed , " @entity16 told @entity0			1
i 'd had equipment issues and had been changing ski boots all the time			2
so for one i just decided to stick with one ski boot and that 's the decision , that 's great			2
" part of it , is that when things go wrong , you think of everything possible is wrong , like the boots or whatever			2
" i went back home and sure i had some concerns			2
but i got my head round it			2
" the break helped -- since returning on january 11 , @entity16 has managed her first three top - 10 finishes of the season and been confirmed in the @entity2 team for @entity13 alongside 18 - year - old sensation @entity52 , who is already a world champion in the slalom discipline			1
" i 'm ready , i 'm in a good place and i still feel i can get medals in @entity13 , multiple medals in my three events , " @entity16 says , brimming with confidence			1
" it just depends how the days go			2
what i 've learned in my career is that anything is possible			2
in @entity13 , it will just depend how the days go			1
" @entity16 , who won giant slalom gold in 2006 and two silvers in 2010 , is used overcoming mixed performances in her @entity18 buildups			1
before @entity68 , she only hit form on the eve of the @entity71 and triumphed despite knee pain , while come @entity73 she had not managed a top - three finish in a @entity21 event for two years because of back problems			1
" what i 've done in the @entity6 for sure gives me great confidence , " she admits			1
" but i do n't plan on suddenly doing that just because i 'm at an @entity6			1
" i 'm just trying the best i can in every race			0
i do n't think there 's any secret			0
sometimes things do n't go your way and sometimes they do			0
" four years ago , she finished second in the downhill behind @entity11 at @entity86 -- but could n't get within half a minute of her teammate 's winning time despite making " the run of my life			2
" last march , she took third place at the world championships in the @entity94 race where @entity11 earlier crashed and tore her knee ligaments			0
they are both the same age -- 29 -- but @entity16 has been unable to match @entity11 's incredible consistency on the @entity21 circuit , which has brought her six overall titles and 59 race wins			1
" i 'd be lying if i said @entity5 not being there ( at @entity13 ) does n't help , " @entity16 says			1
" it 's been so tough for her this year with her injury and not knowing whether she would compete			2
but as a competitor it 's definitely one less rival for me			0
i had the run of my life			0
i was a second quicker than the next girl and @entity5 was still better			1
so this is obviously a huge opportunity for me			0
" without @entity11 in her way in the downhill , life is certainly easier			0
the pair have had their ups and downs in the past but there has always been a mutual respect between them , and they had been training together until @entity11 's latest setback			0
" she can be so consistent and that 's incredible , " says @entity16			1
" because of that , she 's such a great athlete			0
" despite @entity11 's absence , @entity16 says she does n't feel any added pressure to perform			1
" i want to help inspire and i think the other @entity2 girls can do really well			0
we just need to be supportive , " she says			0
" the pressure is before getting to @entity13 , making sure everything is aligned			1
when i get to @entity13 , i 'll relax			1
i 'll have no fear as everything will work out how it 's supposed to			0
" the @entity6 have been dangled in front of her as long as she can remember , the signs still standing on the slopes at @entity138 where she learned to ski -- and which hosted the 1960 @entity6			1
her upbringing in the @entity141 area was far from normal			0
at the age of five , her father @entity142 was arrested and sentenced to nine years in prison for his part in a $ 140 million cannabis smuggling racket			2
he ended up serving two terms of 17 months and four years -- the latter starting in 1995 after he and @entity16 's mother @entity149 had divorced			1
it is a moment she says " helped me focus on skiing , it 's all i wanted to do after that point			0
" despite the disruption to her family life , she has managed to move on			0
" i love to have fun in my life in whatever i do and whatever life brings , whether that 's on the ski slopes or designing underwear , " says @entity16 , who launched her own own lingerie line in 2010			1
" i just want to have fun			0
i want to smile a lot and bring smiles			0
" her dad will be there to watch her in @entity13 , as he did in @entity68			1
as will her younger sister @entity167 , a musician who also competes in the free - skiing big - mountain competitions -- she is likely to be in a neck brace after breaking two vertebrae in her back in a recent fall			1
@entity16 says she has " no idea " if @entity13 will be her last @entity6 -- for now she 's just enjoying being back in the groove			1
" i do n't love it necessarily when i get to races , but then you get in the gate and i want to go faster , " she says			0
" it 's fun again , it 's all about how you feel			0
and i guess that 's the adrenalin - junkie side of me			2
i still love it , but sometimes you have to fight to find that sweet spot			0
" when it 's easy , it 's the easiest thing in the world as it feels right			0
but when you 're struggling , you 're searching for answers			0
" i 'm thankful for the success i 've had over the years			0

@entity16 is *hoping* to fill the @entity6 void left by the injured @entity5
the 29 - year - old won a gold medal in 2006 and two silvers at @entity196
her alternative @entity13 preparations have involved escaping to @entity23 *mid-season*
from a rough start -- her dad was *jailed* for drug smuggling -- she has made it to the top
