@entity17 attacked one e-mail published in some online reports that purportedly supports the @entity13 # 2 claims			2
" various media outlets are reporting on an e-mail that @entity13 # 2 allegedly sent to his bosses , which significantly does not refer to my client at all , nor does it make any mention whatsoever of any of the things outrageously alleged in @entity13 # 2 's lawsuit , " @entity17 said			1
" instead , @entity13 # 2 voiced complaints about his co-workers gossiping and being insubordinate			2
" the e-mail 's lack of @entity3 's name " says it all , " @entity17 said			0
" nothing that is alleged in @entity13 # 2 's lawsuit was mentioned in the e-mail he sent to his bosses , making his claims even more unbelievable			1

" i think i can show a custom , habit and practice , " @entity28 said , referring to his allegation that the actor has sexually assaulted dozens of other massage therapists over the years			0
" if i bring in 100 people that do n't have an ax to grind , do n't want any money , they 're in 50 different states , they do n't know each other , they 're all massage therapists , they all have dates , they 're at different spa resorts and they say this exact same thing happened , it 's pretty hard to refute , " @entity28 said			0
his client " ai n't going nowhere , " and is looking forward to a trial , he said			0

@entity17 produced a restaurant receipt and a time - stamped photograph that showed the actor was in @entity113 , not @entity0 , on that date			0
@entity116 's attorney apologizes about error in sex lawsuit instead of just changing the date on the filing to january 15 -- the day @entity13 # 1 later decided was when it happened -- @entity28 decided to withdraw the allegation from the lawsuit			1
otherwise , it would have hampered the chances of @entity13 # 2 's case , he said			2
