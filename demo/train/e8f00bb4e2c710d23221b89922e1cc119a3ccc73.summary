-- in a race to beat the flu season , medical institutes across the @entity3 will begin human trials for a new h1n1 flu vaccine starting in early august , the @entity1 announced wednesday			1
concern about the @entity10 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year			1
in the hope of getting the vaccine to those who will need it most by october , the clinical trials will enroll as many as 1,000 adults and children at 10 centers nationwide , said officials at the @entity21 , a division of the @entity1 , which will lead the effort			2
the trials will measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine			1
the research is a first step toward @entity3 health officials ' goal of developing a safe and effective vaccine against @entity10 , also known as swine flu , which has been declared a global pandemic by the @entity35 the time frame for developing a vaccine is a tight one			1
" it 's going to be close , " said dr. @entity39 , director of the @entity21 at the @entity1			0
" i believe it can be [ ready by october ] if things run smoothly			0
we hope they will , but you never can tell when you 're dealing with biological phenomena like making vaccines and administering them			0
" the announcement of the @entity3 trials followed the announcement earlier this week , by an @entity52 company , @entity51 , of the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine			1
concern about the @entity10 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year			1
" this virus has the potential to cause significant illness with hospitalizations and deaths during the @entity3 flu season this fall and winter , " said dr. @entity58 , professor of pediatrics and lead investigator and researcher at @entity63 's @entity62			2
" vaccines have always been a vital tool for controlling influenza			0
the results of these studies will help to guide the optimal use of the @entity10 vaccines in the @entity3 and elsewhere in the world			2
" after careful screening , volunteers will be inoculated and then asked to keep a diary on how they feel			0
after eight days their blood will be checked and after 21 days they will receive another dose , followed again by diary logs and blood tests			0
patients will be monitored two months for safety issues , followed by a four - month and six - month checkup			1
" the purpose of these trials is always to make sure they are safe , " @entity58 said			2
" but even after six weeks , if things look good , we 're pretty sure the vaccine will work			2
" she noted the response to the vaccine may vary in different age groups			0
" this is because young people have not seen a flu virus like this one before , " she noted			0
" older adults might have some immunity to the new @entity10 virus as a result of being exposed to similar flu viruses in the past			1
as a result , older adults might need fewer doses or a lower strength of the vaccine than younger individuals			0
" the vaccine at this point has been tested only in animals , where it has shown to be effective			1
further trials will examine questions such as how the vaccine works in combination with the seasonal flu vaccine and whether including an adjutant , a substance that boosts the immune response to vaccines , can make it work better at lower doses			1
other trial sites along with the @entity127 are @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , the @entity133 , and @entity134			2
they will be joined by @entity136 and @entity137			0
