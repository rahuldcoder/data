-- gov. @entity1 asked a federal judge friday to allow same - sex marriages while an appeal over the struck - down law that banned them makes its way through the courts			1
@entity1 and attorney general @entity9 filed briefs two days after chief u.s district judge @entity11 ruled @entity13 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage , known as @entity15 , violated the constitutional rights of same - sex couples			1
in his wednesday ruling , @entity11 also issued a temporary stay , which stopped his decision from taking effect			0
if he lifts his stay , officials in @entity13 could immediately be allowed to perform same - sex marriages again			1
they were able to do so , briefly , before the @entity15 ban passed in 2008			0
" the administration believes the public interest is best served by permitting the @entity30 's judgment to go into effect , thereby restoring the right of same - sex couples to marry in @entity13 , " read the brief from @entity1			1
" doing so is consistent with @entity13 's long history of treating all people and their relationships with equal dignity and respect			0
" supporters of @entity15 argued , prior to @entity11 's ruling , that same - sex marriages would be performed soon after he issued his opinion and could be complicated by rulings and appeals down the road			2
they asked the judge to stay his decision pending appeal			1
the case goes next to the 9th @entity30 , and both sides say it is sure to wind up in the @entity52 @entity51			0
@entity11 could issue his decision on the stay as early as next week			2
@entity9 , a @entity55 who is running to replace @entity1 , also weighed in on the controversial case			0
" as this court has concluded that @entity15 is unconstitutional , the public interest weighs against its continued enforcement , " read the brief from @entity9			1
@entity9 's opponent in the governor 's race , @entity61 , told reporters before @entity11 's ruling she is against same - sex marriage but favors civil unions , according to the @entity67			1
the news agency reported @entity61 , a @entity69 , has explained her vote for @entity15 as one of " faith and conscience			0
" " i believe marriage should be between a man and a woman , " the @entity67 reported @entity61 said at a campaign stop in @entity75			0
proposition 8 is part of a long line of seesaw rulings , court cases , debates and protests over same - sex marriage			2
it passed in @entity13 with some 52 percent of the vote in november 2008			0
same - sex marriage is currently legal in five @entity52 states -- @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 -- and in the @entity96 , while civil unions are permitted in @entity98 .			2

governor and attorney general say enforcement of @entity15 is not in the public interest
*defendants* in the case have asked for a stay pending appeal
the judge could make his decision as early as next week
if he lifts the stay , @entity13 could start issuing same - sex marriage licenses immediately
