@entity0 -- @entity2 set off for a two - week recess friday , flying out of @entity0 under a dark cloud : the " do - nothing " label			1
but that term is too easy			0
if you take a closer look , it turns out the better fit may be the " wasted - time " @entity2			1
the terms " do - nothing " and " @entity2 " may be so cemented together that the phrase no longer tells us much			1
at the moment , it may sound redundant			0
in 2013 , @entity2 spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history			1
how much got done ? let 's start there			2
there are many measures of congressional activity , but one has sparked the " do - nothing " label : bills passed			1
bills passed 2013 : 64 where does that place ? : that is the lowest amount in modern history			2
what about recent years ? : 148 ( ' 12 ) , 90 ( ' 11 ) , 258 ( ' 10 ) and 125 ( ' 09 )			0
the lowest figure during president @entity34 's term was 136 , double the amount passed this year			1
lawmakers pass more blame than bills wait , bills passed does not mean " good " bills passed			2
and it is a key argument for republicans especially			2
" it 's not how many bills you pass , " sen. @entity44 , @entity45 , told @entity1 , " it 's how many you stop			1
a lot of them are bad			2
" this is what we 're getting at here by bucking the " do - nothing " label			2
it does not capture the extent of the problem in @entity2			1
6 reasons why 2013 was a bad year for @entity61 how else can you measure the mess on @entity64 ? by the hundreds of hours it took @entity2 to get so little done			1
days in session ? we could look at the days in session , which were officially more than 150 for both the @entity70 and @entity71			0
that is average for the @entity71 and way above average for the @entity70			0
but those figures can be misleading : they include " pro-forma " sessions when the @entity70 and @entity71 are not really in @entity0			0
instead , consider time in session @entity71 time in session : more than 1,098 hours			2
@entity70 time in session : more than 786 hours			0
. relatively : that 's higher than average for the @entity71 over the past 30 years			0
and lower than average for the @entity70			0
@entity71 clears key nominations , leaves town for @entity88 and there were issues that both parties pledged to address , but left unresolved in that work time			0
to name a few : @entity94 , long - term unemployment immigration energy policy in other words , @entity2 spent hundreds of hours in @entity0 -- far more than average for the @entity71 -- and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day			1
" it 's a lot of wasted time , " sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , told @entity1 , her frustrated tone at odds with her bright holiday red sweater			1
" ridiculous ... it 's exhausting ... it 's been getting worse and worse every year			1
there are so many issues we could be dealing with , and we 're so discouraged			0
" this is perhaps the greatest area of bipartisan agreement : @entity2 is in @entity0 , but doing less			1
" i think we 've been working less , to be honest with you , " sen. @entity115 , @entity116 , said as he left the last @entity71 vote of the year			1
when asked about the increased hours in the @entity71 , he was quick to respond , " the number of hours doing nothing ? yes , absolutely			0
" there is a pervasive sense of frustration mixed with no clear path toward a better , more able @entity2			2
" i think a majority of the members are trying ... and hope that getting back to where the @entity2 does its job is just right around the next corner , " said sen. @entity125 , @entity126 , who previously served as the @entity128 whip in the @entity70			1
" and we keep turning that corner and finding out we 're not there yet			0
" it is a combination of doing relatively little , but taking an enormous amount of time doing it			0
" a lot of wasted time to me , " @entity101 repeated			0
@entity61 says 2013 was n't his worst year			0

@entity2 spent more time in office this year but got less done
some republicans argue that it 's number of bad bills stopped that *shows* *effectiveness*
" it 's been getting worse and worse every year , " *veteran* @entity154 says
long - time @entity128 says , " i think we 've been working less "
