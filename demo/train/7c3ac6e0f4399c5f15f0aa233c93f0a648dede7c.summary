-- facebook on monday appeared to have quietly unveiled a new feature designed to let people see which @entity1 users are nearby at any given time			1
by tuesday , however , the feature seemed to have been pulled from the @entity8			1
the company called the feature " @entity15 , " and on monday it was available through @entity1 's mobile apps and website despite the fact that it had n't been formally announced			1
the blog @entity17 dubbed the feature a " stalking app " because it could open people up to potentially awkward or threatening interactions with strangers on the social network who know you 're nearby			1
to test out the feature on monday , @entity1 users could go to @entity27 in a browser , or follow this path in the @entity1 's mobile apps : menu > apps > find friends > other tools > @entity34			1
surprise ! teens are sneaky online @entity1 users had to opt in to the feature by going to that site , otherwise their profiles would not appear in a list of people who are nearby			1
the blog @entity44 first reported on the feature sunday after a non-facebook developer tipped off the site to the feature 's existence			2
in a comment on that site 's post about the new feature , @entity1 developer @entity54 , who says he developed @entity15 , described how he hopes the app will be used : " for me , the ideal use case for this product is the one where when you 're out with a group of people whom you 've recently met and want to stay in contact with			1
@entity1 search might be effective , or sharing your vanity addresses or business cards , but this tool provides a really easy way to exchange contact information with multiple people with minimal friction			2
" a @entity1 spokeswoman declined to provide additional information			2
" we are constantly testing new features but have nothing more to share at this time , " she wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
reactions to the news were mixed in the tech blogosphere			0
the site @entity83 found the new feature to be potentially useful -- and dangerous			2
" you meet a cute somebody at a concert , you 're like , ' hey , we should be @entity1 friends , ' and they 're like ' @entity90 , totes ! ' then rather than having to spell your names and search around , you 've got a much smaller group of people to choose from			1
i guess that 's great , right ? " @entity96 wrote on that tech news site			0
but @entity98 added : " sure , it 'd be great to easily add a contact quicker , but imagine this : some creeper has been molesting you with his / her eyes all night			0
she opens the app , can kinda recognize your face from your profile picture , and now said creeper knows ( your ) name and possibly some of your personal info			0
" that would be the downside			0
others said the app simply is n't ready for prime time			0
the blog @entity118 called the app " fairly primitive , " and @entity120 said it amounts to " nothing more than a parlor trick at this point " since other location - based friend finders have n't caught on with the general public despite their buzziness in tech circles			2
@entity1 recently acquired a company called @entity130 , which did something similar to the @entity15 feature			1
so there 's speculation that the company 's technology may have contributed to the new @entity1 feature			1
@entity54 , however , the @entity1 developer , wrote on @entity44 's post that he created the feature during a hackathon			1
other similar mobile " social discovery " apps include @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
some of these apps will also show you nearby friends of friends or even strangers who share your interests , based on your social - network profile			2
it 's unclear exactly how much information the @entity15 feature gave away			1
on monday , users had to log into that site intentionally to see a list of people who are nearby , and that list of people appeared to be quite limited			0
also to be determined is how large of a radius the feature employed			0
did it search for people who are within eyeshot of you ? or within a mile ? let us know what you think in the comments section			0
on monday , we were n't able to interact with anyone -- friendly or otherwise -- who was nearby .			0

new : @entity1 appears to have pulled the ' @entity15 ' feature
the feature uses phones ' *gps* to show which of your friends are near your location
@entity17 already has dubbed the feature a " stalking app "
it appears @entity1 users must opt in to the feature , which may allay *privacy* concerns
