-- a man has died after being attacked by a pale - headed saltwater crocodile nicknamed " @entity3 " in @entity5 's @entity4			1
the 57 - year - old man was fishing with his wife on the bank of the @entity10 monday when his line apparently became snagged , @entity6 said			1
" it appears he has entered the water and tragically was taken by a crocodile while retrieving fishing equipment , " they said in a statement on @entity14			1
@entity20 and members of the @entity22 subsequently shot and killed the 4.5 meter ( 14.7 foot ) crocodile , they said			1
the man 's body was found nearby			1
the incident is believed to have occurred about 5.30 p.m. local time monday ( 4 a.m et , 8 a.m. gmt ) , police said			2
@entity29 , from @entity30 , told @entity0 it was the first time in his 20 years working as a guide on the river that such an incident had occurred			1
" there are plenty of crocodiles up here and we do n't have many problems as a rule			0
there are lots of signs , there are lots of cruises , there are lots of warnings and there 's lots of knowledge , " he said			2
five companies operate crocodile cruises in the area with the giant reptiles distributed about one every 100 meters along the river , on the banks of which they could sometimes be spotted , @entity29 said			1
" they normally eat fish and kangaroos and other things -- they 're not after us			0
they 're very timid and elusive animals , they 're very lazy and very rarely seen			0
" he said crocodiles could stay underwater for up to four hours			0
" @entity3 " was recognizable for its pale head and had been known to locals for about 10 years , @entity29 said			1
the late pop singer @entity3 had suffered from the skin condition vitiligo , which caused parts of his skin to lighten			1
@entity29 said it was unfortunate that the victim had apparently entered water inhabited by big crocodiles at dusk to retrieve his lure			1
" the crocodile could have thought he was any sort of an animal			2
it 's just really , really unfortunate			2
this person 's made a tragic error of judgment			2
" recognizable crocodile dr. @entity93 has been researching crocodiles in the @entity4 for about 18 years and was familiar with " @entity3			1
" " what made that particular animal special was that it had a very light colored head , so it was very recognizable , " he said			2
" it was missing part of its tail , two limbs and had a big scar on its belly			0
" he was an old , beaten up , battle - scarred crocodile that everyone knew , " @entity93 said			2
" when this report of someone being killed came in , people knew he was pretty much the only crocodile that lived in that territory , " he said			2
" a lot of people did n't want to see him shot			2
" but @entity93 said that it was a legal requirement that the crocodile be killed so that the coroner could confirm the cause of death by , for example , matching bite marks and examining the reptile 's stomach contents			1
evidence also suggested that if a crocodile successfully took a human it would be more likely to do so again in the future , he said			2
" crocodiles learn patterns and routines and we know from their wild behavior that they 'll actually come back to the same spot to catch a prey animal			0
" @entity93 said that he had heard of other people previously fishing from the same area where the man was taken			1
it had better access than most of the @entity10 , which is mainly edged by muddy mangroves , he said			1
the fact that others may have fished there without incident could have created a mistaken sense of safety , @entity93 said			0
" one of the things that makes crocodiles so dangerous is that you can do things like that and get away with it			0
because crocodiles do n't always attack , " he said			0
" that leads people into a false sense of security about how risky it actually it is			0
" in the wrong place at the wrong time , tragedies like this could then happen , he said			0
" often crocodiles will hone in on people who are actually fishing , " @entity93 said			0
" there have been examples of crocodiles sneaking up and stealing fish			0
likely when [ the victim ] stepped in to get his lure back , it was right there under the water -- probably expecting a fish			0
as far as the crocodile was concerned that was potential food for it			0
" worldwide attacks " it 's just a tragedy on every level , there are no positives that can possibly come out of this , " @entity93 said , adding that someone should n't have to lose their life to drive the safety message home			0
while " @entity3 " was not actually an @entity191 -- a genetic mutation -- it was rare to see crocodiles with its coloring , which likely resulted from temperature changes during its incubation , he said			1
" it does n't happen very often			0
but if you hatch out thousands of eggs you 'll see a few examples every few years , " he said			0
@entity93 said @entity3 was probably 40 to 50 years - old , meaning he would have hatched at a time when the number of crocodiles in @entity5 was low			1
declining numbers led to their protection in @entity5 in 1971 , but the population is now regarded as being almost fully recovered , he said			1
the species was found throughout @entity210 , @entity93 said and a database -- @entity212 -- had been created to record confirmed attacks across the world going back to the 1800s			0
prior to monday 's fatal attack , the most recent suspected attack in the @entity4 was on @entity217 , where @entity5 broadcaster @entity218 reported that " biological remains " had been found inside a crocodile after a man had gone missing earlier this month .			1
