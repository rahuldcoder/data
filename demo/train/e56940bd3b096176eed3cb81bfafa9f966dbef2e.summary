@entity0 -- in light of recent findings that @entity5 was mulling targeting railroad lines to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11th attacks , a senator from @entity0 is calling for tighter rail security			1
@entity11 sen. @entity10 proposed an increase in rail security and an @entity14 version of the @entity16 " no - fly " list			1
the proposal stems from material taken from @entity21 's @entity20 compound showing @entity5 was in the early stages of planning an attack to derail trains on september 11 of this year			1
@entity10 proposed the creation of a " no - ride " list that would check passengers against a list of suspected terrorists to prevent would - be terrorists from boarding trains			1
the list would be used like the government " no - fly " list that screens air travelers			1
" obviously there are certain things that would have to be done , but @entity14 , unlike our commuter rails or subways , does have a ( manifest ) of everyone that rides @entity14 , " he said			0
" they check your name as you walk down so it does n't seem like it 's that difficult to do			0
" he added that he had " discussed it with ( transportation ) secretary ( ray ) lahood and others , and @entity14 , and we 're going to work as hard as we can to get this done as quickly as possible			0
" " while taking @entity21 out last week has been a major victory in fighting terrorism , the war is not over , " @entity10 said			1
" we must remain vigilant in protecting ourselves from future terror attacks , and when intelligence emerges that provides insight into potential vulnerabilities , we must act with speed			2
" he also proposed increased spending on rail security , despite last month 's $ 50 million of cuts to the rail and port security grant program			2
the program provides rail operators with funding for protection against explosive devices in tunnels , deterrence , and training for rail personnel			2
" let me just say , look , we are much safer on the rails than we were on 9/10/01 , " he said			0
" and safety keeps getting better , better and better			0
when it comes to safety you can never rest			0

@entity10 wants suspected terrorists *banned* from passenger trains
the list would *mirror* the " no - fly " list that screens flyers
