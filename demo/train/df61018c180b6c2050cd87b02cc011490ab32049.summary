-- a comedian who did n't risk looking foolish would n't even be in the game			2
in " @entity4 , " which has the scruffy honor of being the first female buddy - cop action comedy , @entity3 does more than risk looking foolish â € ” she risks coming off as borderline insane , like a dissolute biker -- turned -- homeless person , like she 's royally out of control			1
is it any wonder that she shocks the audience into laughter in more scenes than not ? with her naughty - angel features , and her italicized gumption that 's so stylized it turns sarcasm into a blunt - witted form of sincerity , @entity3 plays @entity24 , a proudly slobby lethal weapon of a @entity27 police detective who favors fingerless leather gloves , keeps an arsenal of firearms ( including a rocket launcher ) in her refrigerator , and doles out cut - to - the - quick insults the way that most of us say '' hello ! '' movies : 10 all - @entity38 @entity24 gets paired with her opposite number : @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , an uptight , by - the - book @entity43 agent in ugly off - the - rack pants suits			1
@entity41 may be great at catching criminals , but she 's so smug about it that she drives even her @entity43 boss ( @entity47 ) crazy			2
the laws of the buddy - cop comedy are as basic , familiar and inviolable as the rules of checkers			1
a pair of law enforcers get yoked together , and they do n't pretend to like each other			2
one is a tut - tutting straight - arrow , the other a wild - card screw - up			0
and no matter how thick the jokes get , the gods of gunfire and major vehicular damage must be served			0
there 's no reason to think that this time - honored testosterone formula , with two actresses now planted at the center of it , would change all that much , and in " @entity4 , " it does n't			1
except in one crucial way			0
funny ladies packing ' @entity4 : ' not your typical buddy cop movie the director , @entity72 , possesses a highly developed radar for the alternating currents of competition and camaraderie in female relationships			1
as he proved in " bridesmaids " ( 2011 ) , the one other major film he 's directed , @entity72 understands how women who do n't like each other express their antipathy â € ” in ways both more direct and less direct than what men do			1
in " @entity4 , " @entity72 stages scenes like @entity87 ( " @entity88 " ) with a touch of @entity90 ( " @entity91 " )			1
he has made a piece of smash - and - grab policier pulp that , through the interplay of @entity42 and @entity3 , spins to its own snarly / confessional feminine beat			1
@entity96 - @entity38 there 's a very funny scene in which @entity41 and @entity24 , who have teamed up to nab a drug lord , go undercover at a dance club , where @entity24 tries to transform @entity41 's '' bank teller '' outfit into something halfway clubby			2
she rips off @entity41 's sleeves , then her pant legs , revealing a pair of @entity108			2
yet even as @entity24 is shredding her partner 's clothes and shredding her ego even more , her hilarious lack of mercy comes off as a version of sisterly compassion			0
forget the mid-level dealer whose phone they 're out to bug			0
she 's trying to save this poor woman from herself			0
@entity41 's problem is that she 's all head and no instinct , a kind of @entity127 - trained robot ; she does n't know how to bond			1
@entity3 plays @entity24 ' repugnance at her partner 's inhuman professionalism with a cringing spontaneity , as when she puts up her hand for a high five , and @entity41 has to go and wreck it by slapping and then clasping that hand			1
( it 's far from the only time in the movie when @entity24 looks like she wants to throw up , a motif you would not see in a male buddy comedy			1
) as long as these two are at loggerheads , " @entity4 " has a catchy , lock - and - load hostility			1
it 's much more clever than , say , the two " @entity145 " films , and less cartoonish than either the " @entity149 " movies or the " @entity88 " sequels ( though not " @entity88 " itself )			0
with @entity42 doing a variation on her " @entity155 " geek - tomboy - who - has - to - bloom character , and @entity3 letting her acidly oddball observations rip , the two actresses make their interplay bubble			1
when @entity24 confuses @entity159 's overly fussy pair of pajamas with a tuxedo , it 's all wrong , yet somehow right			0
and when the partners go to an old man 's bar and do shots all night , dancing to @entity168 's '' @entity163 , '' the drunken craziness is infectious enough to make you want to join them			0
but once these two get to be friends , the comic tension dissipates , and the film 's boilerplate drug - dealer plot takes over and goes on and on			2
" @entity4 " is fresher than a lot of the male - centric movies it takes off from , because there 's little about aggressive guy banter that has n't been worn to the ground by @entity182			1
you can tell how much the times have changed when @entity41 gets an oyster - shucking knife stuck in her thigh , then pulled out , then shoved back , or when she performs a graphic emergency tracheotomy â € ” and the blood - gushing grossness is , in every sense , a gag			0
it 's genuinely jolting ( in a way that , i suspect , may prove highly commercial ) to see women go through these motions			0
but the motions are still market - tested and machine - tooled			0
even when they 're channeling the happy madness of @entity3			2

@entity42 and @entity3 *co-star* in " @entity4 "
directed by @entity72 , it 's the first female buddy cop action comedy
the duo work best when their characters are n't friends
but when they become chummy , the comedy goes *downhill*
