@entity0 , @entity1 -- civic unrest over a spike in gas prices roiled @entity1 for a fourth straight day wednesday , with gunshots ringing out around the capital of @entity8 and elsewhere as government forces tried to clamp down			2
high school - and college - age youths played a big part the first demonstration sunday -- a day before the price hikes went into effect -- in @entity16 , a city about 190 kilometers ( 120 miles ) southeast of @entity0			1
one student died of gunshots during that protest			2
police said that it was not known where the fatal shot came from , though activists on social media blamed police			1
hundreds joined in similar demonstrations that broke out around the country in the subsequent days			0
witnesses said some of these outbursts of public sentiment were accompanied by violence and destruction , including attacks on gas stations , damaging of buses and looting of stores			1
the ruling party 's offices in different parts of @entity0 also came under attack			2
police responded with tear gas , according to witnesses			1
there was no indication the tension was abating by wednesday night , when the @entity50 appeared out and gunfire could be heard around the capital -- though it could not immediately be discerned where police or armed activists were responsible			0
the origin of the unrest is a government policy , which has been debated for more than a month , to get its economic house in order			0
as part of that plan , the @entity62 government lifted its subsidy on gas -- leading to prices nearly doubling overnight when the policy took effect early this week			1
that 's had a trickle down effect on other expenses as well , such as bus fares , and it 's expected to lead to a major uptick in food prices over the coming weeks			0
