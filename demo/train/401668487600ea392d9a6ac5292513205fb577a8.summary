-- @entity2 team @entity1 unveiled plans for a new training academy on tuesday , as the club looks to build on its recent on - field success			1
@entity1 were taken over by taken over by @entity8 billionaire @entity7 in august 2008 , and have invested heavily their playing squad since			2
manager @entity10 guided @entity1 into the @entity11 for the first time in their history with a third - place finish in @entity16 's top division last term , as well as leading them to an @entity19 triumph -- the club 's first trophy in 27 years			1
now the @entity23 outfit are hoping to maintain their push for honors with the development of a brand new academy complex a mere stone 's throw from their 47,000 - seater home in east @entity32			1
@entity34 's dominance a sign of @entity2 weakness a planning application for the project , which would boast 15 full - size and two half - size football pitches as well as accommodation for 40 youth - team players , was lodged by the two - time @entity16 champions on tuesday			1
" @entity1 has entered a new phase in the long term strategy set out by the club 's owner three years ago , " read a statement on the club 's official website			1
" whilst the club already has a strong pedigree of nurturing young talent ; the limits of what can be achieved with the existing facility have been achieved			0
" the site will also contain a 7,000 - capacity stadium for youth team matches , a separate building for the first team and a bridge linking the @entity23 to the area -- which will be known as the @entity64			1
" the development and recruitment of youth talent is at the heart of our long term strategy of building a sustainable football club for the future , " @entity1 's chief football operations office @entity65 said			1
" the opportunity to build a world class facility supported by a well researched youth development plan would be a significant step in the realization of that strategy			0
" @entity79 , editor of @entity80 , told @entity0 that despite the @entity1 's financial investment in their youth set - up , only time will tell whether it will change their current strategy of signing big - name stars such as @entity87 striker @entity86 and @entity89 midfielder @entity88			2
" i 'm always slightly suspicious when big clubs start investing in youth policies , " said @entity79			0
" @entity92 did it a few years ago and very few young players have come through the youth system there			0
" @entity79 also cast doubt on @entity1 's ability to match the set - up of @entity101 champions @entity100 , who have brought a number of first - team regulars through their famous @entity106 academy			1
" i 'm always suspicious as well when clubs say they 're going to copy @entity100 , because they are the great team of the moment and it 's very fashionable to copy what they 're doing			0
" but what @entity100 have been doing goes back decades , you ca n't just buy it overnight			0
even if you 're talking about a long - term development plan it 's going to take decades			2
" @entity79 also said that the successful development of young players is not necessarily achieved through financial investment , but through adopting the correct attitude to nurturing emerging talent -- citing @entity123 champions @entity122 as a perfect example of the right approach			0
" the clubs that are successful with youth policies are the clubs that do n't necessarily spend a lot of money , but believe in youngsters and believe in putting youngsters into the first team at an early age			0
" so a club like @entity122 , which is famed for its youth academy , would n't spend a huge amount more than other clubs			2
but what they do have is a commitment to putting youngsters out ; blooding them at an early age and believing that if you 're good enough you 're old enough			0
