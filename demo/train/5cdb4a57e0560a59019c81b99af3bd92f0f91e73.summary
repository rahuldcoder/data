-- " 22 jump street " wholeheartedly embraces the sequel formula , and critics could n't be happier			1
as the follow - up to 2012 's blockbuster comedy " @entity5 , " " 22 jump street " essentially rehashes everything about its predecessor but does so in a self - referential way that does n't sacrifice humor			1
it helps that the original team is back : directors @entity12 and @entity12 have returned to the helm , and stars @entity14 and @entity16 are once again playing a pair of hilariously ineffective undercover cops who report to an irritated @entity19			2
really , the only thing that 's changed is that @entity14 's @entity21 and @entity22 are going undercover at a local college instead of a high school			2
but for once , sticking to the formula has worked			2
" 22 @entity29 is damn funny , sometimes outrageously so , " praises @entity28 's @entity27			0
" it laughs at its own dumb logic and invites us in on the fun			0
" somehow , the movie " steers blessedly clear of common sequel traps , even while brazenly committing so many of the form 's sins , " says the @entity35 's @entity34			1
" the truth is , the old - married - couple dynamic between the two men is still funny , especially in the deft hands of @entity16 and @entity14 , who have built a comic chemistry worthy of @entity45 and @entity46 â € ” or at least @entity47 and @entity48			0
" the leading comic duo were also irresistible to @entity51 critic @entity50 , who believes that the movie " still tickles a comedy sweet spot partly because both actors are naturally likable and seem to be having a good time			1
" the only thing that seemed truly worn out were some of the jokes about sexuality , observes @entity61 critic @entity60			1
part of the plot involves @entity21 and @entity22 going their separate ways for a while as they fall into different social circles on campus , leading to " numerous homoerotic references to this fading friendship , but only in a ' @entity71 ' your chain , bro ! ' way , " @entity60 says			0
" it 's there that ' 22 jump street ' wobbles off the rails			0
... the recurring ' gay , not - gay ' jokes are neither particularly funny nor insightful , and they push the movie slightly out of whack			1
... ( but ) ' 22 jump street ' is n't uncharitable or mean - spirited ; at worst , it 's just confused			0
" despite those flaws , the sequel is projected to perform well at the box office this weekend , with observers betting on an opening of at least $ 50 million			1
and if you 're seeing the movie this weekend , here 's a tip from the @entity94 's @entity93 : " be sure to hang around for the closing credits , which imagine all sorts of ' jump street ' sequels to come , all of which look funnier than ' @entity100			0
' " @entity14 and @entity16 's ' lucky ' bromance review : ' 22 jump street ' is a repeat			0

" @entity106 " is basically the same as " @entity5 "
but critics are praising the comedy sequel for its *smart* *approach*
the jokes about sexuality are a noticeable flaw , one reviewer says
