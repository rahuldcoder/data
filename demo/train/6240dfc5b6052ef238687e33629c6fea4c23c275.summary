@entity0 -- a new incident inflaming tensions between the @entity4 and @entity5 -- this time the alleged massacre of 16 @entity5 civilians by a @entity4 soldier -- calls into question the chances for stability as the @entity4 - led military mission shifts security responsibility to @entity5 forces in coming months			1
sunday 's shootings in kandahar province followed a series of events that already had sparked anger and distrust between the @entity5 and @entity4 governments , including the burning of @entity23 by @entity4 soldiers that led to a violent backlash , including attacks that killed @entity4 service members			2
now the concern is that an atrocity apparently carried out by a lone @entity4 soldier will heighten anti- @entity4 sentiments among a civilian population that is key to a successful counterinsurgency strategy against the @entity35			1
suspect suffered brain injury in 2010 , @entity37 official says analysts and @entity4 officials said monday they believe the transition under way -- which seeks to end the @entity4 - led military mission in 2014 -- will remain on track , though the process may be more difficult			1
" there is still no better option and the @entity5 still are n't ready to handle their problems without us , and i think they know that , " said @entity47 , a senior fellow at the non-partisan @entity48 , in an e-mail to @entity1			0
@entity55 , a senior political scientist at the non-partisan @entity57 research organization , said the sunday incident " certainly adds to tension between the @entity4 and the @entity5 , but i do n't believe this is a tipping point			1
" in the end , @entity55 told @entity1 , a key issue is whether local @entity5 clans and sub-tribes will continue to work with @entity4 and @entity5 forces as part of the transition process			1
" if it becomes clear in multiple regions that they would prefer a smaller @entity4 role , especially one not in the lead , i do think that means transitioning to an @entity5 lead faster , " @entity55 said			2
calls to hasten the transition in @entity5 had increased at home before sunday 's shootings			0
last week , two dozen @entity4 senators -- democrats and @entity81 -- sent a letter to president @entity83 that argued for a faster handover of security responsibility to @entity5 forces so that @entity4 combat forces could come home			1
senate majority leader @entity89 , @entity90 reacted to sunday 's shooting by adding to the calls for bringing @entity4 troops home from @entity5 as soon as possible , while @entity81 presidential hopeful @entity94 said the entire @entity5 mission needs to be reassessed			1
the @entity83 administration insisted monday that the civilian killings , while tragic and horrific , would not change the goals or timing of the @entity4 strategy to defeat @entity101 in @entity5 and turn over security responsibility to @entity5 forces			1
" this is a challenging time , there 's no question , " @entity103 press secretary @entity102 told reporters monday			0
" i do not believe that this incident will change the timetable of a strategy that was designed and is being implemented to allow for the withdrawal of @entity4 forces			2
" @entity102 noted that in the aftermath of the recent violent backlash in @entity5 after the @entity117 burnings by @entity4 troops , the two nations were able to complete a long - negotiated memorandum of understanding on the transfer of detainees			2
also monday , the @entity37 called the mass shooting in @entity5 " an isolated incident , " and spokesman @entity123 said the overall mission there remains the same			2
" despite what some are saying , we are not changing our fundamental strategy , " @entity123 said			0
in addition , he said , recent polls that show a lack of @entity4 support for the war will not affect the strategy			0
@entity47 , of the @entity48 , said fallout from the sunday shooting could harm efforts to negotiate a long - term strategic partnership with @entity5 intended to maintain @entity4 support after the end of the formal military mission			1
so far , those talks have been " impeded by impasses over issues such as @entity147 night raids and civilian casualties , " @entity47 added			0
@entity55 , the @entity57 analyst , said news of sunday 's attack was sure to travel quickly throughout @entity5 , spread by mullahs in mosques , word - of - mouth and radio			0
the government will likely depict the incident as the latest of many atrocities by both sides , noting @entity35 killings of civilians , while the @entity35 will try to portray it as another example of @entity164			0
@entity166 aggression , @entity55 added			0
in @entity5 on monday , the @entity35 called @entity4 forces " sick - minded @entity4 savages , " warning in an online statement that the group would mete out punishment for their " barbaric actions			1
" president @entity174 labeled the attack an " unforgivable " crime , and people in the area of the killings were angry at both @entity4 and @entity5 security forces , whom they accuse of failing to protect them , villager @entity173 said			1
" the people in these villages are scared , and we do n't know what is going to happen next			0
... they saw nothing except the @entity4 going and killing them in their homes , " @entity173 said			0
to @entity55 , the greatest anger will come from " the specific sub tribes and clans themselves where they lost villagers			0
" " i think this will require some time to shake out , " he said , adding that the full impact of the attack wo n't be known until the view of the @entity5 population becomes more clear			1
only if the @entity5 government and the @entity5 people want to quicken the pace of the @entity4 withdrawal will that happen , @entity55 said , adding : " it should n't be based on one incident			2
" @entity1 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
