, it was confirmed on thursday			0
at a meeting of the @entity2 's 20 chairmen in @entity12 , the historic decision to use goal - line technology for the start of the 2013 - 2014 season was approved			1
it means the system provided by @entity16 - based firm @entity15 , chosen ahead of @entity18 company @entity17 , will be in place for the curtain - raising @entity20 on 10 - 11 august			1
" football is fundamentally a simple game ; whichever side scores most goals wins , " said chief executive @entity24 on the @entity2 's official website			1
" so , when one is scored , or indeed not scored , and we have the ability through technology to definitively know whether the ball crossed the line we should absolutely use it			2
" fans , players and managers exhort , strain and stress respectively for their teams to score or prevent goals being scored , so we as administrators should do all that we can to ensure the correct decisions are being made			0
" @entity44 said that the fact that @entity15 used cameras was a ' critical ' factor in selecting the technology , since it can be replayed by broadcasters -- with the @entity2 also exploring whether replays can be played on big screens inside stadiums			1
" it is essential that fans see the system in action to know that it is working , " he added			0
@entity15 's system uses seven cameras to track the movement of the ball and sends a signal -- within a second -- to watches worn by match officials when a goal is scored			2
@entity63 had long opposed the use of the technology until a valid @entity67 goal was disallowed at the @entity68 , prompting president @entity69 to alter his stance on the issue			2
@entity72 was at the helm on that occasion but current @entity67 manager @entity75 believes the introduction of @entity6 represents a watershed moment in the history of football			0
" it 's probably one of those moments that will go down with the changes to the offside rule and the back - pass rule , which most of us at the time were very skeptical about , but which we 've now taken to our hearts because we appreciate it , " he said			0
first trialled by @entity63 at last year 's @entity90 in @entity91 , @entity6 will be used at july 's @entity92 and next year 's @entity90 in @entity93 , with @entity18 company @entity17 set to provide the technology on both occasions			0
overlooked by @entity63 for those tournaments , @entity15 -- which already provides ball - tracking systems for tennis and cricket -- will install its technology in 20 @entity2 grounds and at @entity103 , which will host august 's @entity20			1
@entity67 is the first of @entity106 's major leagues to announce plans to introduce @entity6 with @entity18 's @entity108 saying last month it had no plans to use the technology until 2015 at the earliest			1
while the head of @entity112 's @entity111 said this week that he saw no need to use @entity6 , a leading @entity115 official said he hopes to adopt the system within three years			2
" we are not going to be as quick as the @entity2 but we are in favor of the system , " said @entity117			1
" i expect that in two or three years we will be able to do something like this , either with technology that we buy or that we create ourselves			2
" in a separate development , the @entity2 has ratified controls that oblige clubs to restrict losses to a limit of $ 162 million over a three - year period			1
the move has been made to put a break on clubs ' spending , with many suffering economic concerns in recent times			0
according to the most recently - published accounts , defending champions @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 have all reported losses in excess of $ 162m over the last three years			0
the @entity2 says clubs that break the rules could face a points deduction .			0

@entity2 sanctions use of goal - line technology for 2013 - 2014 season
system will be installed at every @entity2 ground as well as at @entity103
@entity2 is at least two years ahead of other major @entity154 leagues
