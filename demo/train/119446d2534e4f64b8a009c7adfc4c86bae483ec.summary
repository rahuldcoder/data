-- amid all the noise and chaos of a short - track speed skating final , there is one voice in the crowd @entity6 can hear as clear as a bell			1
it belongs to his girlfriend and fellow speed skater @entity10 , urging the @entity11 on to the finishing line in a competition that is as thrilling as it is dangerous			1
@entity6 likens his sport to walking on a wire in mid-air , but despite the precarious nature of his chosen discipline , he can always make out her voice above the din			1
" she 's the only person i can actually hear when i 'm skating , " the double @entity22 champion told @entity0 's @entity24 series			1
" she 's really loud in the stands but it 's like her voice gives me energy			1
if i know she 's there it gives me belief in myself			2
" they are both targeting next year 's @entity35 in @entity36 , with @entity37 -- now 23 -- having won two silvers at @entity39 while @entity6 became a national hero with two golds on the same day			1
" we live together and i know what she 's doing and she knows what i 'm doing , and it 's a good thing to have someone to talk to about everything we love the most , " @entity6 said			1
that reassuring presence is clearly key for the 29 - year - old from @entity51 , in a sport where the margins are miniscule			1
with competitors haring around the ice at speeds that often near 40 mph , any involuntary nudge or bump can be fatal to their chances of glory			0
but for @entity6 , who has successfully negotiated his way to eight world championship titles as well as those two olympic gold medals , that flavor of danger fuels the adrenaline that keeps him coming back to the rink			1
" when we go at our fastest speed it 's at the limit			1
you ca n't hold it but if you do , if you just let it go , you 're going to fall , " he explained			2
" it 's like you 're walking on a wire in the air , and if you make a little step in the wrong direction , you 're going to fall			1
" i think it 's a thrill to be on every corner -- every two seconds we have a corner			2
it 's a kind of a thrill doing a fast lap in short track and for us , that 's what we love , and that 's why we are great at it			2
" strength is a prerequisite for any speed skater but @entity6 underlines the importance of being able to marry that power to shrewd in - race tactics			1
rules forbid speed skaters to intentionally bump their fellow competitors out of the way but contact is inevitable in the jostle to take each corner first			2
@entity6 's ability to steer the right course and adopt the proper tactics has seen him consistently hit the line ahead of his rivals			1
" in short track there 's more strategy , there 's passing , there 's bumping , there 's a lot of action in short track , and it 's one of the reason why it 's a popular sport in the @entity22 , " he said			1
" you 're not allowed to push anyone , you 're not allowed to actually touch anyone , but for sure in a race you 're going to have to pass inside or outside and are going to bump a little bit			0
" it 's not the strongest guy on the line who will win , it 's the smartest ; the guy who will do the best race , who will win the race , and it 's a good thing			1
" the risk of crashing is high , as is the risk of injury , so skaters learn from a young age how to survive the tumbles			0
" when you know how to fall , the injuries are less and less , and you have a better chance to stay healthy , " @entity6 said			2
" if you get injured during the summer , and you miss two or three weeks of training , then the year will be tough for you and not because you 're not a good skater			0
" you have three weeks to catch up on everyone , so at our level it 's really difficult to do that and we try to avoid any big injury , especially when it 's an @entity22 season			0
" speed skating is a sport that runs in the blood of the @entity6 family			1
@entity162 ' brother @entity161 has also enjoyed success at the top level , as they formed one half of the @entity11 relay team that secured gold in the 5,000 meters at the @entity39 in 2010			0
their father , @entity168 , is the program director for @entity11 's short skating stars , and led the team to five medals in @entity172			0
@entity161 started skating when he was five and @entity173 was soon hooked too			0
their younger brother @entity174 also took up the sport and the family would spend hours on the ice honing their technique			0
@entity173 says it was when he turned 17 and made the @entity182 that he dared to dream that his goal of making the @entity22 could become a reality			0
it did at the @entity186 in @entity187 in 2006 , and though his silver medal was an impressive return on debut , it only strengthened his resolve to hit the top of the podium four years later in front of a home crowd			0
" it was my day , " he recalls			0
" in the 500 meters i got the gold with a crazy race , a crazy finish , and 30 minutes after i came back on the top of the podium with all my teammates to win gold in the relay			0
" two golds in the one day , in 30 minutes , it was the best day of my life			0
" with a lifetime ambition fulfilled , some may have been forgiven for thinking @entity6 might take his foot off the gas but if anything , his @entity22 success has only galvanized his love of competition			2
" when you reach the top of @entity11 or the top of international competition and you touch the podium , you get the feel of it and you just want to repeat it , " he said			0
" i just want to stay there as long as possible and that 's what keeps me wanting it more and more and more			0
" most people ask me why i continued after @entity172 because i won two gold medals , but i say , ' i love my sport and i love to win , so i want to keep doing it and be better at it			2
