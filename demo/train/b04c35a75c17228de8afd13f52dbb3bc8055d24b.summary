-- there are fears of @entity3 and it is october , but it 's not a @entity7 novel			2
it is a case of international naval intrigue off the @entity11 coast that brings back memories of the @entity13			2
the @entity11 military on monday intensified a search in the ocean off @entity17 for an underwater mystery vessel , but stopped short of calling it a submarine			1
civilian vessels were ordered to stay at least six miles ( about 10 kilometers ) away from the @entity11 warship conducting the search , the @entity22 - language website @entity23 reported			2
the search began thursday after @entity11 intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in @entity3 , reported @entity23 , citing the @entity11 newspaper @entity30			1
the radio transmissions were being sent to the @entity3 enclave of @entity33 , 330 miles ( 530 kilometers ) south of @entity17 on the @entity36 's southern shore , according to the local report			1
there were also reports that a foreign vessel was spotted in the waters near @entity17			2
@entity3 on sunday denied it has any vessel in @entity11 waters			1
@entity43 suggested the vessel may belong to the @entity44 and have been involved in naval exercises off @entity11 , according to a report from @entity3 's @entity48 news agency			1
the @entity44 were quick to respond , saying a sub involved in the exercises was anchored in @entity52 harbor of @entity54 - ally @entity53 for the weekend , according to a report from @entity56			0
' we have good stamina ' on monday , the @entity11 military vowed to continue searching at least for the next few days , according to @entity23			1
" we have good stamina , " @entity23 quoted defense spokesman @entity60			0
" we 're using the sensors we have and are searching both from land and water , " @entity60 was quoted as saying			0
to confuse matters even more , the @entity11 military said monday that it purposely provided incorrect information on sunday about where the mystery vessel was sighted to keep the search area secure			1
@entity70 officials told @entity0 there are no @entity70 submarines or surface ships in the immediate area			0
@entity70 intelligence does n't know of any @entity3 assets in that area , the officials said			2
all the activity begs the question , why would a @entity3 sub need to snoop around in @entity11 waters anyway ? @entity82 of the @entity11 @entity83 of @entity84 gave three possibilities to @entity23 : " they could be mapping the waters in order to be able to navigate them in the event of hostilities , " @entity82 is quoted as saying			1
" they could also be installing equipment , like sensors , that could track or get an observation of our units in that area , " he goes on			0
" or they could also possibly reconnoiter our ( defense ) systems			0
" @entity3 military around the world whether there is a @entity3 sub in @entity11 waters or not , there is no question that @entity3 forces have been active in the @entity36 and around the globe this year			1
in fact , the @entity11 military said sunday that it has monitored suspicious activity for several years , according to another report in @entity23			1
in july , a @entity70 @entity116 reconnaissance plane fled into @entity11 airspace after the @entity3 took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land - based radar			1
the @entity3 then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the @entity70 aircraft			2
and on april 23 , a @entity3 @entity127 fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a @entity70 @entity116 @entity130 reconnaissance plane over the @entity131 between @entity3 and @entity132 , a @entity125 official said			0
also on april 23 , @entity44 fighter jets scrambled to intercept a pair of @entity3 @entity136 bombers that entered a half - mile into @entity44 airspace			0
on june 4 , according to @entity70 defense officials , four long - range @entity3 @entity136 bombers , accompanied by an aerial refueling tanker , flew into the @entity70 @entity141 , an area extending 200 miles ( 320 kilometers ) from the @entity144 coast , off @entity145 , where they were intercepted by @entity70 f - 22 fighter jets			0
two of the @entity3 bombers peeled off and headed west , while the other two flew south and were identified by @entity70 f - 15 fighters within 50 miles of the @entity152 coast			0
and last month , two @entity145 - based @entity70 @entity116 f - 22 fighter jets intercepted two @entity3 il - 78 refueling tankers , two @entity3 mig - 31 fighter jets and two @entity3 bear long - range bombers , according to capt. @entity157 of the @entity158			0
more than six hours later , two @entity161 @entity160 fighter jets intercepted two @entity3 bombers in the @entity163 , @entity157 said			0
those @entity3 planes came within about 40 nautical miles of the @entity161 coastline , he said			0
