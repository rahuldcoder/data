the @entity4 administration , after initially resisting the idea , is weighing whether to deploy @entity6 troops to the southern border to help address a surge of migrant youth from @entity10 , many of them unaccompanied , a @entity1 official told @entity13			1
the @entity14 and the @entity15 sent a team earlier this week to assess @entity18 efforts in the @entity19 , the official said , where tens of thousands of children have poured into the @entity21 this year			1
the administration 's latest efforts in what most agree is a humanitarian crisis come as @entity26 struggles to address the matter with little optimism for a solution before @entity30 breaks for its month - long august recess			1
immigrants or refugees ? here 's the latest : little optimism for a solution from @entity30 : house speaker @entity36 accuses president @entity4 of being " awol " on the crisis and flip - flopping on solutions			1
a key partisan point of contention is a @entity44 proposal to change a 2008 law that allows @entity10 immigrant children to stay in the @entity21 until they receive a hearing			1
that process can take months or years			0
@entity44 want to tweak the @entity50 - era law so that migrant youth from @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , who do not qualify for refugee status , are sent home more quickly			1
@entity58 worry the expedited process will mean many will fall through the cracks and will be sent back to what many have characterized as violent situations in their countries			0
" the administration started earlier this month by signaling some openness to changes in the 2008 law to accelerate the process of returning these children to their home countries , " @entity36 told reporters on thursday			0
" the president called for this change , the secretary of homeland security called for this change , and other administration officials have called for this change			2
now the president and his team have apparently flip - flopped			2
" @entity1 @entity44 proposed a $ 1.5 billion package on wednesday aimed at helping to resolve the crisis			1
the tally is nearly $ 1 billion less than that proposed in a measure by @entity58 just a day before and less than half of the $ 3.7 billion @entity4 has said he needs to effectively combat the problem			2
however , top congressional leaders from both parties say they doubt @entity30 will act before beginning its recess			2
time to do something is also short when they get back in september due to the upcoming midterm elections in november			0
meanwhile , @entity1 minority leader @entity93 , @entity94 , and members from the @entity97 congressional delegation were to meet with officials from the @entity19 and the @entity100 office of @entity101 on thursday to discuss the problem			2
@entity1 reconsidering @entity6 : the @entity1 has not embraced calls from @entity44 and even some @entity58 to send guard troops to the border with @entity106			1
president @entity4 suggested , in a conversation with @entity97 gov. @entity108 earlier this month , that it could be a temporary solution			1
@entity108 followed up this week , announcing he would deploy up to 1,000 guard troops to the border area most affected by the surge -- the @entity19			0
a @entity1 official told @entity13 there had been no request from homeland security officials for such a step , but that the @entity14 would make the call , if asked for help			0
@entity120 , commissioner of @entity121 told @entity13 's " @entity125 " on thursday the administration is " very pleased " and optimistic with conditions " at the border			0
@entity120 also noted that the flow of migrant youth has slowed , but also said that is a usual occurrence in hotter parts of the summer			0
@entity10 leaders in the @entity21 : @entity53 president @entity132 and @entity52 president @entity133 are slated to speak at the @entity134 , a nonprofit , foreign policy think tank , on thursday about ways to stem the from of immigrant kids			1
@entity132 and @entity133 , along with el @entity54 president @entity138 , are scheduled to meet with president @entity4 and vice president @entity139 on friday			1
@entity50 calls on @entity140 to fix the problem : @entity142 gov. @entity50 , a possible 2016 @entity44 presidential candidate , wrote an opinion piece in the @entity144 asking fellow @entity44 not abandon comprehensive immigration reform and asking for the affected immigrant children to be treated more compassionately when they are taken into custody			1
his piece echoes themes in a similar statement last week to @entity13			0
" president @entity4 has promised to once again act unilaterally if @entity30 fails to take up immigration reform , " @entity50 wrote			2
" now is the time for @entity140 to demonstrate leadership on this issue			0
@entity30 should not use the present crisis as an excuse to defer comprehensive immigration reform			0
" key questions about @entity108 's border plan			0
