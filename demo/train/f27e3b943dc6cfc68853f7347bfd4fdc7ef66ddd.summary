" i never thought that i would bring this trophy back home on three occasions			2
i want to become one of the greatest players of all time			1
" @entity0 , who picked up his first world player of the year award in 2008 and repeated the feat in 2013 , was hotly tipped to scoop the title for the third time after completing another spectacular season at @entity40			1

@entity2 , who won the @entity14 award for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012 , admitted in an interview at the weekend that it would be " difficult " to win this year when @entity0 and @entity11 had enjoyed such success in 2014 -- the @entity10 was a key member of country 's @entity75 winning side in @entity77 and conceded just 40 goals in 62 matches all year			1
if nothing else , the trip to @entity15 was a welcome distraction from speculation about his future at @entity8			0
rumors have circulated recently that the @entity7 is unhappy at the @entity86 -- @entity2 was recently left out of the starting line up in a @entity57 match against @entity89 and missed a training session the following day with " a stomach bug			0

" " i have n't asked for anything to stay here because i have never wanted to go anywhere else			0
i have also heard that i have spoken to @entity113 and [ @entity115 ] city ... but it 's all lies , " @entity2 told the @entity106 club 's tv channel			0
stories circulating that he had poor relationships with former coach @entity119 , former star players including @entity121 and @entity122 and asked for them to be moved on were " in no way true , " he said			0
" i am tired of hearing things about me			0
they say that i run the club when i am just another player			0
i do n't make those decisions , nor have i asked to make them			0
" however , at the awards ceremony , @entity2 sent the rumor mill turning when he admitted : " i do n't know where i 'll be next year			1
" he added : " i always said that i would finish my career at @entity8 and then at ( his home town club in @entity7 ) @entity134 's			0
" as @entity0 ( @entity0 ) said recently , football has many twists and anything can happen			1
" low on a high a number of other awards were given out during the star - studded ceremony including the @entity142 which went to the man who masterminded @entity144 's @entity75 win last july , @entity143			1
" it is the icing on the cake , the cake being the @entity75 , " @entity143 said			1

" i 'd like to thank everybody who has voted for me			2
this was a very special moment for me and everyone in @entity179			0
" @entity172 's goal -- scored in front thousands of spectators at the @entity198 in @entity199 and watched by millions on television -- pipped @entity202 's volley			0
@entity204 's spectacular goal was witnessed by an altogether smaller audience -- just 95 people were at @entity209 's @entity208 game against @entity210			0
