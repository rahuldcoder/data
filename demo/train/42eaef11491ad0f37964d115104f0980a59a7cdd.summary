there had been " growing concern " about former @entity10 director @entity9 's leadership in the two weeks since a man with a knife managed to jump the @entity5 fence and get into the @entity6 , a source tells @entity11			1
but the " final straw , " the source said , was that she and the agency did not inform the president about a september 16 breach at the @entity16 in @entity17 -- in which a private contractor who had a concealed gun shared an elevator with president @entity22 -- until just before the media reported it on tuesday afternoon			1
" the problems about the elevator breach were a ) that it happened , b ) that no one told the @entity5 about it in the midst of two weeks of many discussions with them about security and then c ) that the president did n't find out till just before the media was about to report it , " the source said , agreeing that " final straw " would be an apt description of that event			1
elaborate video shows entire security breach at @entity5 the source , who spoke to @entity11 anonymously so as to speak more candidly about sensitive events , said that there was every reason to believe @entity48 and @entity10 leadership took the september 19 fence jumper incident " very seriously , " though @entity5 officials were not pleased with how facts and details about that incident kept changing , both in public media accounts and to them privately			1
that , however , could be explained and understood , the source said , given the " fog " of conflicting accounts inherent in such an intense and adrenaline - filled event			0
there was no such understanding about why , two weeks after the september 16 elevator incident at the @entity16 , the president was not informed until just before the @entity64 and @entity65 were prepared to share details of that event with the world			2
there was no going back ; she had lost @entity22 's confidence that she was the right person to run the agency			2
on wednesday , homeland security secretary @entity73 said he had accepted @entity48 's resignation and was appointing an independent panel to investigate the @entity5 breach			1
presidents are loath to publicly criticize the @entity10 for fear of straining any relations with the agents who keep them alive and protect their loved ones			0
so perhaps it was left to senate majority leader @entity84 , who told reporters in @entity86 on wednesday , " i am just so disappointed in what i 've seen			0
i ca n't imagine being a father of two girls and seeing this happen in my home			0
i 'll bet @entity92 is just beside herself -- they are so protective of those two girls			0
so i ca n't be a cheerleader of the @entity10 today			0
