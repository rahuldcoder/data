once he 's ready to go home to @entity19 , he 'll have access to counselors and psychologists , @entity40 principal @entity39 told @entity24			1
the quiet teen , who recently transferred to @entity46 , is now the talk of the school			1
@entity49 , a senior , said the boy was extremely shy			0
he told @entity0 that he had just arrived within the past few weeks			0
but he already wanted to run away from home -- apparently to see his mother in @entity53			1
his father and stepmother live in @entity46 , where neighbors say family members kept to themselves after moving in a few months ago			1
" when i watched the analysis about the extraordinary and dangerous trip of my son on local tvs and that @entity66 had saved him , i thanked @entity68 and i was very happy , " the teen 's father told @entity61 's @entity53 service on wednesday			1
he described his son as a " really cool boy , " a " very quiet person , always busy with watching the tv and using computer			2
" when asked what might have motivated the teen 's trip , the father told @entity61 his son had been struggling in school			1
" he did not receive education when he was in @entity80			0
since we came here , he had learning challenges at school			0
he was not good at math and science , and i think he had a lot of education problems bothering him , " the father said			2

" we want to go back , but due to the current living conditions , we ca n't go back			0
" the boy is said to have hopped a fence at @entity94 shortly after 1 a.m. on sunday , the dark of night cloaking his intentions			0
but the teen , who has not been publicly named , did n't just breach the fence -- he stayed on the grounds for six hours without getting caught , a government official said			2
the boy just wanted to see his mother in @entity53 , a law enforcement official said			1
but he had no clue which plane went where			2
eventually , he settled on a @entity106 767			0
armed with nothing but a comb , he climbed into the jet 's wheel well			2
as the plane took off , the wheels came up -- barely sparing the teen from a crushing impact			1
it was just the first of several dangers that nearly took his life			0
the temperature dropped well below zero			0
by the time the plane ascended higher than the peak of @entity124 , he had passed out			2
it was n't until an hour after the plane landed in @entity20 that he emerged from the underside of the jet			2
the idea that he survived the flight seemed unbelievable			0
the boy is now in the custody of @entity21 child welfare services workers , said @entity136 , spokeswoman for the state 's @entity137			1
it 's quite possible he suffered permanent brain damage such as neurological issues , memory problems or a lower iq , said dr. @entity145 , a trauma surgeon at @entity147 's @entity146			2
the teen also could have frostbite or a kidney injury because when the body freezes , particles of muscle enter the bloodstream and damage the kidneys , the doctor said			0
