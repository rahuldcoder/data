-- and in that very moment , we heard a loud whack ! from outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe on a tree			0
then we heard the tree fall			0
the very last @entity9 of them all ! a community where the last tree is cut down to make a " @entity9 " that no one needs			1
where real trees have been replaced by artificial ones with disco lights			0
a plastic city where people pay for clean air			0
that 's the smoggy setting of " @entity22 , " the country 's no. 1 movie for the second weekend in a row			2
based on the dr. @entity28 classic , the environmentally themed movie has attracted children and adults to the theaters , earning $ 121.7 million in its first 10 days , according to @entity33			1
the movie made $ 70 million on its first weekend in release , the biggest opening weekend for a movie this year and about double what @entity33 box office division president @entity37 had estimated			2
even midweek ticket sales for the film , produced by @entity42 and released by @entity43 , have been high			0
" ' @entity9 ' exceeded expectations by a mile , it was crazy , " said @entity37			1
" the visuals are irresistible , and it was a powerful draw for people			0
it 's a terrific movie at the end of the day , entertaining to parents as much as to the kids			2
" we went the day that it opened , and my 3 - year - old sat through the entire movie completely interested , " said @entity54 , an @entity55 , @entity56 , stay - at - home mom of two boys			2
" we were talking about it on the way home , and for a 3 - year - old , he got a lot of the concept			0
it had a strong message that unfortunately is something that all of us are going to need to be more aware of moving forward			0
" audiences want family - friendly fare any dr. @entity73 movie will have a built - in audience among adults who remember the books from their childhood and the children who are reading those classics now			1
and although every major movie studio now has an animation unit , they have n't released much this year to satisfy the demand for family - friendly fare , according to @entity85 , senior editor at @entity86			2
" the last big family film hit was ' @entity88 : chipwrecked , ' way , way back in december , so there 's been a pent - up demand for family films as a lot of schools head into spring break , " said @entity85			0
" two other factors in the @entity9 's huge opening : a really successful marketing campaign by @entity43 -- the voice cast was all over sister network @entity100 in the week before the opening -- and the fact that it 's in @entity103 , which means higher ticket prices and profits for the theaters and the studio			1
" the movie is not without its critics			1
while not objecting to the movie itself , some parents claim that some of the movie 's commercial tie - ins with @entity116 , @entity117 and other companies ignore the @entity9 's essential green message			1
( the studio also has partnerships with @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 , among others			0
) " in the movie , the corporate ' bad guy ' puts up billboards for products saying ' @entity134 , ' and the message was that co-opting the @entity9 's image and brand is a bad thing , " said @entity126 , a blogger and author of " @entity129 's @entity128 : simple steps to reduce your child 's @entity140			1
" " to me , the compelling message of the book , and the movie , was that slick advertising can make us want things we do n't need , and producing them can result in catastrophic environmental harm , " said @entity143			1
" and yet , @entity43 has completely ignored that message , as have the launch partners , by slickly advertising @entity9 - approved products -- products that we do n't need			1
" " we tried to look for partners who provided some sort of a good environmental choice for consumers , " said a @entity43 spokesperson , declining to comment further on the debate over the commercial tie - ins			0
" we are absolutely thrilled at the response to ' @entity9			1
' " companies want you to " buy , buy , buy " that 's why parents like @entity170 , who lives in @entity171 , @entity172 , are refusing to take her children to the movie			2
@entity170 reads the book to her daughters , 2 and 4 , to teach them about how their actions and the things they buy affect the environment			0
" this kind of corporate green - washing is the antithesis of the @entity9 's message , " said @entity170			1
" the @entity117 ad in particular upends the @entity9 's message in order to sell cars			1
instead of taking my ( 4 - year - old ) daughter to see the movie , we are having conversations about how some companies just want you to buy , buy , buy , without thinking about what that means for the trees , the animals and people			0
" movie experts say tie - ins are a fact of life for many movies , and especially children 's animation flicks			0
without added revenue from movie - themed toys , fast - food tie - in deals , dvds and related books , family - friendly fare wo n't get made , says @entity86 's @entity85			1
( @entity43 did n't order up a @entity9 - themed @entity214			2
) the movie 's marketing efforts and its success at the box office is helping multiple dr. @entity73 books get back onto the best - seller lists , according to @entity221 , children 's reviews editor at @entity223			1
" his books are perennial favorites , of course , but the film and all the marketing muscle behind it certainly have a hand in that kind of sales bump , " says @entity221			0
" and while companies like @entity117 have drawn fire for their ties to the @entity9 film , publishers routinely publish numerous book tie - ins to capitalize on upcoming movies			2
@entity240 has published @entity9 activity books , early readers and a pop - up book this spring			1
they are n't just banking on the original book			0
" @entity246 , whose 3 - year - old son has spina bifida , prefers to focus on the movie 's message that one person can make a difference -- and must try even if no one else agrees			1
" it 's not only about caring for your environment , but also about speaking up for those who ca n't speak for themselves , " said @entity246 , who lives in @entity254 , @entity255			0
" whether we 're talking about trees or children with disabilities , it 's important to me that my son knows from an early age to always try to do the right thing -- even if you 're the only one trying			0
" and that 's the @entity9 narrator 's message to all his little readers			2
unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot , nothing is going to get better			0
