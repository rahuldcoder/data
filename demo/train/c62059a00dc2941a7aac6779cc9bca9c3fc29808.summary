-- when pitcher @entity2 walks out of the dugout on opening day with the @entity4 , he 'll already have a large group of fans in the stands -- his new roommates at the @entity9 assisted living facility			1
pitcher @entity11 stands as residents and friends of @entity14 of @entity15 welcome him tuesday			1
the 25 - year - old , who was drafted in 2006 by the @entity17 and is trying to work his way to the majors , admits he was caught a little off guard when he was told about his new housing situation			0
" at first i was like , ' ok , that 's a little different , ' " he said			2
" i was taken aback at first			0
" and he was also the butt of a couple jokes from his teammates			2
" they were saying things like ' so what 's the deal ? do you have to go to bed early ? ' " @entity2 said			1
but then he told them about his room -- a large suite , with his own kitchenette , washer and dryer , furniture and a tv			0
" then they changed their tune , " he said			0
" they were like ' that 's awesome			2
are they any other vacancies ? ' " like many of the players in the independent @entity48 who do n't rake in the big bucks , @entity2 is living with a host family			1
but his host family is a little different			2
most of the players live with families with younger children			1
but in his case , @entity2 is the young one -- about 55 years younger than the rest of his " roommates			1
" eighty - four - year - old @entity58 , who has been living in the center for four years , said @entity2 's arrival is the most exciting thing to happen since a good @entity63 impersonator showed up			1
" it 's been quite exciting because he 's young and new and interesting and we 're old , " she joked			1
@entity2 made his way to the assisted living center in @entity15 , @entity68 , near @entity69 , with the help of @entity71			1
she heard the new local baseball team was looking for host families for the players			1
but because she has a 3 - and 4 - year - old at home , she turned to her family 's assisted living center as an option for @entity2			1
@entity71 went to the residents with the idea and they unanimously voted for @entity2 to live there			1
but his new housing situation is about more than just a place to crash after the game			0
" it certainly is great for the residents because now we get a lot of energy and youth and excitement , " @entity71 said			1
it has turned into an exciting time for the residents , who jumped at the chance to decorate the entire facility before the pitcher 's arrival			1
" you should see the decorations , " @entity71 said			0
" the residents all signed motivational good luck pennants for him , there 's a 40 - foot banner , we have a whole thing dedicated to @entity2			1
i 'm sure he is so embarrassed with all of the baseball cards with their face on it			0
" they 've made signs telling him he 's in a league of his own , but they 've also set their expectations high for him			1
" some of the pendants say things like ' do n't get cut , move your butt , ' " @entity71 said			0
" he 's certainly going to be under the microscope ! we 'll be watching and keeping track of all of his stats			2
" @entity2 was awestruck when he walked in and saw all of the decorations			2
the activity director has been doing craft activities with the residents -- making visors with baseball logos and @entity4 necklaces in anticipation of the game			2
@entity133 is looking forward to watching their new ace pitcher hit the mound even though she has n't seen a baseball game live in a while			2
" anything 's better than the @entity140 right now , " @entity133 joked			2
" we 'll definitely be cheering for him , though , and if he happens to have a bad game , he 'll have a lot of shoulders to cry on			0
but i do n't think he 'll need them			0
" @entity147 , 85 , said even though she 's more of a football fan , she 's looking forward to following @entity2 and baseball more closely			1
" we are just wishing him well because it 's such a great experience for all of us , " @entity150 said			0
" we 're looking forward to having him around			0
" @entity2 said he is excited to help bring some fun to the residents , some of whom are already considering him to be like a grandson			1
" i always loved spending time with my grandparents and one of my great - grandparents was in an assisted living home and i remember how excited she was to see us when we went to visit her , " he said			0
" and they are being so nice to open up this place to me , so hopefully i can bring a little bit of joy			0
" @entity2 , who had surgery two years ago and was dropped from the @entity17 during spring training , is hoping his stint with the @entity4 can help get him picked up by a @entity170 team			2
regardless of what happens , he knows he has the support of his new roommates			0
" they 've all really come out and supported me , they even bring me food and give me snacks , " he said			0
" i could n't ask for anything better			0
and with all of them watching so closely , i 'll have to keep my game up			0
they 've definitely set a high bar for me			0

because of little pay in independent league , players stay with host families
