-- after my short journey home from the hospital with our newborn seven years ago , i hit my first breaking point			2
breastfeeding was not going well and so we hired a " lactation expert " to come to my rescue			2
i viewed my initial inability to breastfeed as nothing short of failure as a mom ! for the record , i am a huge proponent of breastfeeding and know there are lots of great and supportive lactation experts and consultants -- but sadly , mine was not one of them			1
when the lactation guru had me sit in my dining room chair naked from the waist up , and forcefully moved my breast around like a piece of meat to find the exact position for the " latch , " i knew this was not the way breastfeeding was supposed to go			2
i shrieked something to that effect and politely asked her to leave			2
oh @entity36 , i hope that does n't happen to you , but if it does , know you are not alone			1

do n't think you 're horrible if you ca n't breastfeed " not everyone makes a ton of milk and if you do n't , do n't feel bad about it and get depressed and think you 're a horrible mom , " said a mother of two who preferred to stay anonymous , remembering how she endured a " never - ending " cycle of breastfeeding , pumping and giving her boys bottles since she could n't produce enough milk			1
" if someone had told me that different moms make different amounts of milk , i think i would 've fared better after the first baby			1

" @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 , which is short for @entity215 , and yes , that ridiculous nickname was created by the baby 's dad ! , " she said , offering this advice to @entity36			1

" it 's going to get easier , " said mom of two @entity282 of @entity76 , @entity77			1
" although you feel like you ca n't catch your breath now , someday , your baby will be putting her own clothes on or fixing himself a snack , and you 'll say , ' where did the time go ? ' " that 's exactly how i feel about that newborn whom i finally figured out how to breastfeed			0
