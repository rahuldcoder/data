-- the spread of the potentially fatal @entity4 respiratory syndrome has become more serious and urgent , the @entity1 said wednesday			0
at the same time , @entity1 said that -- for now , at least -- the illness known as @entity6 does not constitute a global health emergency declaring an emergency is " a major act " that can " raise anxieties , " said dr. @entity11 , the organization 's assistant director - general for health security			1
despite concerns about the syndrome , researchers have not found " any increasing evidence of person - to - person transmissibility , " he said			0
there have been 571 confirmed cases of @entity6 , including 171 deaths , according to the @entity1			1
the number of countries with confirmed cases expanded to 18 , with a case in the @entity26 , @entity1 reported wednesday			1
many of the cases are in @entity29 and the @entity30			2
even without any official worldwide alert , @entity31 , the head of the @entity33 's @entity32 , acknowledges that " this is a relatively new virus that does have a high fatality rate , " ample reason to pay attention			1
authorities have n't pinned down all the details about how exactly it arose and how it spreads , though @entity31 said , " we do n't have evidence right now that this is airborne ... the way the measles virus is			2
" " we do n't know as much as we would like so far , " the @entity33 official and assistant surgeon general in the @entity47 told @entity0 's @entity48 on wednesday			1
" ... but we 're tracking it and trying to understand			0
" @entity51 health care workers test negative two cases have been confirmed in the @entity53			1
both patients are health care providers who were working in @entity29			2
the first is in @entity57 ; the second in @entity51			0
two health care workers who came in contact with the @entity51 patient later went to an emergency room with flu - like symptoms			1
but they tested negative for @entity6 in a state test , the @entity33 said wednesday			1
the @entity51 @entity6 patient , specifically , was fever - free and continuing to improve wednesday while undergoing treatment at @entity70 's @entity69 , the state 's health department said			1
given the virus ' apparent roots in the @entity73 , @entity31 said it 's important that health care workers ask anyone who has suspicious " respiratory symptoms " where they have been in recent weeks			1
" more and more people are going to be traveling the next couple of months , so we really want clinicians to be on the lookout , " she said			0
commercial airlines are on guard as well , including efforts to make sure those who might have come into contact with the two @entity6 patients in the @entity53 did n't come down with the virus			1
@entity91 said in a statement that it is " working very closely with the @entity33 , and contacted our flight crew as soon as we learned of ( one such ) diagnosis			1
the @entity33 is in the process of contacting passengers to advise them of any necessary precautions			1
" " we are leaving no stone unturned in ensuring the good health of our employees and customers , " the airline said			2
and @entity104 said that , like all carriers , it " has a long - standing protocol for working with the @entity33 , as we are in this instance			1
the safety of our customers and employees is @entity104 's top priority			0
" one traveler who was on one possibly affected flight told @entity0 affiliate @entity114 that the call she got about one confirmed case of @entity6 left her " really scared			1
" twelve days after her flight , she said , her state health department called and sent her a note asking whether she had symptoms such as fever or cough , and also saying she should record her temperature for two weeks			1
" i was in shock that i could actually contract it , " she said			0
the woman , who did not want to be identified , said she and her husband so far had no symptoms			2
another traveler , @entity129 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity130 that the @entity33 called him twice in two days , saying he was on a flight from @entity132 to @entity133 with someone who had @entity6			1
he said officials would not disclose how close he was to the patient			2
four people -- each from different families -- have been tested in @entity139 for @entity6 because they were on a plane with one of the two confirmed @entity53 patients , said @entity139 health department spokeswoman @entity143			1
none of those four had any suspicious symptoms , she added			2
tests for two of them have come back negative for @entity6 , while the other results are expected in the next couple of days			1
@entity6 does n't spread like flu @entity6 , first found in the @entity73 in 2012 , is a coronavirus -- the same group of viruses as the common cold			1
it attacks the respiratory system			0
symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure			0
there is no vaccine or special treatment			0
besides those who contract the virus by coming into " very close contact " with someone suffering , @entity31 cited " a lot of interesting studies ... about camels and whether some sort of exposure to camels or their products might be important " in explaining @entity6 origins			2
while little is known definitively , " fortunately , so far , it has n't shown itself easily to spread from person to person , " she added			0
dr. @entity180 , head of preventive medicine of @entity182 explained wednesday on @entity0 's " @entity183 " that @entity6 can " spread in the context of providing health care			1
" that 's very important			0
and it has occasionally spread in @entity29 from one family member to another			0
it requires close , constant , over time exposure			0
" people who go to a doctor or hospital with respiratory symptoms should be asked immediately whether they 've traveled to the @entity4 or been in contact with someone who did			0
" if the answer is yes , you put that person in isolation , " @entity180 said			0
specimens are then taken and sent to the @entity33 for further testing			2
" that system is working , " he said			0
@entity51 's health secretary , dr. @entity206 , said wednesday that the case in his state " is contained			2
" " there is no broad threat to the general public , " @entity206 said			0
5 things to know about @entity6 @entity214 , others checked for fever representatives of 13 countries made up the @entity1 emergency committee that convened tuesday through a phone conference , the @entity1 said			1
affected countries need to take immediate steps to improve infection prevention and control , the @entity1 said			2
the majority of infections have taken place inside hospitals			0
defense secretary @entity228 got a firsthand brush wednesday with fear of the disease in the land of its likely origin			0
before a meeting in @entity29 with crown prince @entity236 in @entity237 , everyone entering the room with @entity214 unwittingly passed by a device screening for fever			0
its operators told reporters that they were checking for people who might be infected with the virus that causes @entity4 respiratory syndrome			0
they found no one with a raised temperature			0
who does not recommend such a tactic in general , @entity11 said			0
some @entity6 patients do n't have fevers , so just checking temperatures could " create a false sense of security , " he said			1
the @entity33 is not recommending that anyone change travel plans			2
the @entity259 has instructed its embassies and consulates in @entity29 , @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , and the @entity30 to provide @entity53 citizens with @entity33 's general guidance for infection control , a @entity259 official said			1
@entity0 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
