-- @entity3 's netbook - friendly @entity1 takes direct aim at @entity5 , whose eight - year - old @entity6 leads the netbook market			1
but the odds are stacked against @entity3			1
despite its buzz , the odds are stacked against @entity3 's @entity1 becoming a serious rival to @entity14			1
in competing with @entity14 , @entity1 will have to deal with many of the same challenges @entity17 has : compatibility , usability , and unfamiliarity			1
the record is n't good : in the past year , @entity17 - based netbooks have rapidly lost market share to @entity5 , as people find that @entity17 does n't work as expected , may not support the applications or peripherals they 're used to using , and is just plain different			1
" the propeller heads or early adopters understood what @entity17 was about , " says @entity27 , an analyst with @entity28 , a market research company			0
" but as netbooks have gone mainstream , users want the apps they are familiar with rather than the non-standard ones on @entity17			2
" while sales of netbooks have exploded , @entity17 's market share on these devices has dramatically declined			1
in 2008 , about 24.5 % of netbooks shipped with an @entity17 operating system , estimates @entity28			1
this year , it 's expected to plunge to 4.5 % and in 2010 , only 3 percent of all netbooks will run a @entity17 os. even if it offers the same or better features than similarly - equipped @entity14 notebooks , @entity1 will face the same uphill battle @entity17 has			1
here 's what @entity3 needs to figure out to make @entity1 a success			1
compatibility with popular applications some of the earliest netbooks featuring @entity17 faced high rates of return because they did not support popular applications , says @entity27			2
" many users found that the universe of applications compatible with @entity14 was much larger than those with @entity17 , " @entity27 says			2
" so when they looked at their @entity17 netbooks not only did it run non-standard apps but also a graphical interface they were n't familiar with			2
" @entity1 will run on top of a @entity17 kernel , although @entity3 has said that it will have an entirely new interface and will run all web applications rather than native @entity17 apps			1
@entity70 compatibility issues in some flavors of @entity17 helped add to early customer confusion , says @entity73 , director of @entity75 services at @entity76 , which supports @entity78			2
" some of those @entity17 netbooks that did n't have @entity82 preinstalled or multimedia codecs pre-installed faced lot of problems , " he says			2
translation : if a customer ca n't watch @entity87 on her new netbook , she 's more likely to return the netbook rather than install @entity90 's @entity82 for @entity17			2
what @entity3 must do : @entity1 ca n't afford to make those mistakes			2
flash support and the ability to play a wide variety of multimedia files will have to be standard			0
and where popular application support is missing , @entity3 will have to ensure that it provides satisfying alternatives ( such as @entity100 in place of @entity102 )			2
usability user interface is a big factor for computer buyers			0
many netbook buyers are first - time @entity17 users			0
and these newbies have often been stumped by the operating system 's unusual interface			1
even with very @entity14 - like and user - friendly @entity17 distributions , like @entity78 , they often do n't know how to perform simple system management or hardware configuration tasks			1
options for those exist on the os but new users have to put in the effort to learn , which can be a turnoff			0
@entity1 will have to find a way to offer its customers a familiar graphical user interface that makes it easy to do the tasks they have been used to on a @entity14 operating system			1
" @entity128 is a very significant component for new operating systems , " says @entity27			0
" you have to fight the first impression that this is different and then you have to sell people on why different is better			0
" what @entity3 must do : @entity3 needs to integrate @entity135 , @entity100 and the @entity1 web browser in a package that makes it easy to not just use these individual programs but also perform other routine tasks , such as installing new software or changing display configurations			2
compatibility with popular hardware @entity3 will also be under pressure to ensure @entity1 works flawlessly with gadgets such as cameras , printers , smartphones and e-book readers			1
so far , @entity17 netbooks have had a spotty record			0
some such as @entity78 or @entity153 offer better support for popular gadgets but still users have faced compatibility problems			0
a recent review from the @entity159 complained that @entity17 - based netbooks could not load software drivers to print photos to @entity164 and @entity165 printers			0
the review also said there were problems loading pictures over a usb cable from the @entity171 digital camera onto a @entity165 @entity173 netbook running @entity78			0
another big stumbling block for @entity3 will be @entity175			1
the popularity of @entity177 means that many people expect their netbook to sync with their ipods			0
however , netbooks running @entity17 do not support @entity175 , including @entity78 , and that means no @entity177 or @entity184 support			1
" @entity175 itself does n't work on @entity78 but you can use emulators , " says @entity73			0
" it 's something we would like to change			0
" it also has to be dead - simple to use hardware that 's pre-installed on your netbook , such as a webcam , a @entity196 connection , or a 3g wireless data card			0
what @entity3 must do : @entity78 and other @entity17 vendors may not have the clout to get @entity201 to support @entity17 , but @entity3 could make it happen for @entity202 and @entity201 share a close relationship , and @entity3 ceo @entity204 is a member of @entity201 's board of directors			1
also , drivers for @entity208 hardware or webcams in the netbooks come pre-loaded with @entity14 netbooks ; @entity1 will have to ensure it offers customers the same simplicity right out of the box			1
resistance to change @entity219 users may complain about glitches in the @entity14 operating system , the viruses and the blue screen of death			1
but unhappy as they may be , they are not beating down the doors of any of the @entity17 vendors to get a new os. more than 80 percent of the at least billion pcs worldwide run some version of @entity14 , and 96 percent of netbooks are running @entity14 , according to @entity231			1
changing consumer expectations has been one of the biggest challenges that @entity17 vendors face			2
@entity3 will have to deal with this , too			0
what @entity3 must do : massive advertising			0
fortunately for @entity3 , this is a business it knows well			0
support from netbook makers one of @entity5 's biggest strengths is the relationships it has built with device makers such as @entity165 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248			0
as a new entrant @entity3 will have to work with these pc makers to ensure that netbooks come pre-loaded with @entity202 can probably swing a few early deals , as it has with @entity253 , but to be a force to reckon with it needs to ensure widespread availability			1
so far , @entity17 vendors have found that difficult to get oems completely on board			0
pc makers do n't want to jeopardize their relationship with @entity5 , which powers the higher - margin products such as desktops and notebooks			0
what @entity3 must do : wheel - and - deal to ensure that @entity1 is available on as many netbooks as possible			1

the odds are stacked against @entity3 's new operating system as a rival to @entity14
@entity1 must face the same challenges as @entity17 : compatibility and unfamiliarity
a big stumbling block for @entity3 will be whether its system supports @entity175
@entity3 must work with @entity219 makers to ensure netbooks are pre-loaded with @entity1
