@entity0 , @entity1 -- my friend posted this message as her @entity7 status update : maybe it 's just me , but i am extremely uncomfortable with any married man calling me " just to say hi			1
" not good ! respect your wife ! my initial response was this has to be a joke ... right ? then the comments started flying with woman after woman not only liking the status update but also telling their own tales of married men trying to befriend single women			1
the biggest complaint from most women was that lately some married men have been living double lives			1
in social settings , these married men partied all night long , had lingering conversations and exchanges with single women all under the guise of business for their charity or event			1
these married men are the " undercover agents " of the single scene			1
they purposely put themselves in situations where they can infiltrate the single female scene all the while wearing their wedding bands to make these women feel safe			1
one woman said it best on my friend 's @entity7 comment thread : " if a married man is trying to cultivate a friendship with me and i do n't know his wife , he 's out of line and i want nothing to do with him			1
the last thing i need is a woman looking at me sideways thinking i 'm interested in her man			0
i 'm too grown for that kind of drama			0
" drama is exactly what you get when a married man tries to befriend a single woman without mentioning his wife , much less an introduction			2
with that said , i 'm declaring it is almost impossible for a married man to be friends with a single women if she does n't know the wife			1
i recall attending a number of events organized by a well - known fundraiser in @entity0			0
he is incredibly charming , intelligent and always the life of the party			0
his circle of influence is extensive , including media professionals , politicians and some of the city 's " movers and shakers			0
" at every event i attended , his wife was never present			0
oddly enough , the majority of the women that he knew in attendance were single			2
granted , there was a slightly even mix of men and women , but i found it odd that so many of the women were single			2
needless to say , the men in attendance were mostly married and had their wives with them			2
each time i interacted with this person , i made it a point to ask about his wife			0
there was always some " good " reason that she was not at the event ; mostly it was that she was home with the kids			0
i find it hard to believe that with his amazing ability to fundraiser and organize , he never had a babysitter available on at least one of those nights			0
a couple of my friends discussed these events at length and wondered could he be an " undercover agent " ? we debated back and forth considering all the possibilities			0
maybe his wife did not like attending social events , preferring to stay at home ? is it possible that these events were his outlet , and she trusted him enough to do these events solo ? but each time we considered the possibilities , there was the lingering question : why did he never bring her up in conversation ? there was something about his demeanor with the women with that glance at your outfit that lasted just a second too long			2
it always seemed as if he were the eligible bachelor in the crowd			0
so , to avoid these questions , my advice to married men is simple : you are married and can not enjoy some of the same luxuries as single people			1
that includes befriending single women under the guise of business ventures without introducing your wife			1
to single women : if it feels icky , then it more than likely is n't meant to be a business discussion			1
no one says that married people and single folks ca n't be friends			2
but show some respect for your partner -- the one to whom you 're married !			0

@entity169 reports @entity7 storm over too - friendly married men
she says when they phone up or hang out with single women , it looks *suspicious*
wearing a wedding ring does n't make it ok to party with other women
*critic* : if i 'm not friends with his wife , too much of his attention is *disrespectful*
