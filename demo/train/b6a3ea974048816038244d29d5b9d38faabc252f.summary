@entity1 , @entity0 -- last week , @entity4 's former leader , @entity3 , was killed , apparently by rebel forces			1
when he was captured , he was by all accounts alive , with a gunshot to the arm			0
but the official autopsy report indicated that @entity3 died of a gunshot wound to the head			1
now , the @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and even @entity15 secretary of state @entity16 are calling for an outside investigation into the circumstances of @entity3 's death , and the @entity21 has asked to inspect his body			1
was the killing of @entity3 a war crime ? there are several competing versions of what happened to @entity3			1
unfortunately , the @entity4 doctor who conducted the autopsy has not disclosed whether the forensic evidence indicated that he suffered the head wound in a crossfire , as leaders of @entity4 's interim government have claimed , or at close range			1
the latter would obviously suggest that @entity3 was murdered after he was taken into custody			0
since this was the closing chapter of an internal armed conflict dating back to february , the situation was governed by the international laws of war as codified in the 1949 @entity42			1
under these rules , it is a war crime to kill a combatant after he has been disarmed and taken into custody , except after a fair trial			1
such a summary execution is to be distinguished from the killing of @entity50 , which occurred during his capture and amid the fog of battle			0
will the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) get involved ? since the situation in @entity4 has been referred to the @entity21 by the @entity55 , the @entity21 has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity and war crimes in @entity4 since february 2011			2
under this grant of authority , the @entity21 's jurisdiction extends not only to @entity3 and his troops , but also to the @entity65 forces and leaders of the national transitional government			1
the @entity21 has indicted @entity3 , his son @entity68 and the head of the secret police but has so far not focused on the acts of @entity65 forces			0
that 's because the @entity21 's governing statute guides the prosecutor away from isolated acts toward large - scale atrocities , providing that " the @entity21 shall have jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large - scale commission of such crimes			0
" that focus could change , however , if evidence emerges of a policy of widespread retaliatory killings by @entity65 forces , and if the @entity21 concludes that @entity3 's death was a part of that policy			1
to prevent the @entity21 from taking further action , the new @entity4 authorities have announced that they are undertaking their own investigation into @entity3 's death			1
under the @entity21 statute , the international court must defer to domestic investigations unless there is evidence that such investigations are a sham			2
@entity3 's was not the only mysterious death in @entity103 last week			0
@entity14 has reported evidence of the apparent murder of 53 people , believed to be @entity3 supporters , in a @entity103 hotel that came under the control of @entity65 fighters			0
many of the bodies were reportedly found shot in the head with their hands bound behind their backs			0
this latest atrocity suggests that the new @entity4 authorities should not be trusted to investigate the death of @entity3 on their own			2
what does this mean for the new @entity4 government ? at present , leaders of the new government are promising early elections and a quick transition to democracy			2
to gain international financial assistance , the new government needs to prove its commitment to basic human rights			0
lingering concerns about extrajudicial killings will set back that effort			2
an international commission of inquiry , launched by the @entity135 and headed by former @entity21 president @entity136 of @entity137 , is investigating reports of extrajudicial killings , torture and other crimes in @entity4			1
this is an appropriate body to examine the circumstances of @entity3 's death			0
cooperating with the @entity145 would be an important first step on the road to proving that the new @entity4 can be a nation pledged to the rule of law			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity153 : @entity3 taken alive but died with *bullet* to head ; rights *groups* want investigation
he says @entity42 say that killing combatant after he 's been disarmed a war crime
transition government promises probe ; this limits international court 's *options* , he says
@entity151 : to get *global* aid , a new @entity4 must show it can properly address extrajudicial killings
