-- obsession often brings joy and sorrow in equal measure			1
inside that thin , shiny packet giving off a mystical glow sits five stickers -- five faces of five men whose very presence can turn lives upside down			1
welcome to the world of @entity14 sticker collecting			1
" my girlfriend gave me an ultimatum the other day , her or the football stickers ? shame really , i thought she was the one , " @entity20 , a @entity21 collector , told @entity0			1
while most relationships survive the sticker phase , @entity20 is not alone in his infatuation with the shiny adhesives which smile back at those dreaming of the holy grail -- the full sticker album			1
some are relentless in their pursuit of that holy grail , setting up spreadsheets and even calling in their spouse to increase the odds of successful swapping			0
" my husband , @entity39 , is obsessed with his sticker album , " @entity36 , who blogs under the name of brummymummyof2 , told @entity0			0
" he has his own spreadsheet so he knows what he needs and what he does n't			0
" every time i go near a shop i have to get my three - year - old daughter some stickers and then get some for my 31 - year - old husband			1
" he 's a fantastic dad to our two children but i think the opportunity to collect stickers reminds him and his friends of being kids			1
" when i go to work , he gives me his swaps , and i swap them with my colleagues and then bring them back			0
" i 'm like a drug dealer ... but with stickers			1
" @entity62 , the @entity64 company which creates the stickers , has been producing the iconic adhesives for the world 's biggest football tournament since 1970			1
based in @entity69 , but with subsidiaries across the globe , @entity62 can produce over 25 million packets of stickers a day -- that 's over 750 million individual stickers			1
the company , which has a partnership with @entity77 , the world 's governing body , has exclusive rights to create products for the tournament			1
sold in 100 countries worldwide , the phenomenon has become synonymous with the @entity14 , which is held every four years			1
" i was very addicted when i was younger , " @entity84 , from @entity85 , @entity86 , told @entity0 , of his sticker obsession			0
" all we would do in recess was trade stickers			1
i 'd also go downtown to the street vendors with my father or grandfather			0
they had drawers full of stickers and would sell them for different prices individually			1
" looking back , it 's just crazy how stickers would just take over and be all that mattered for those couple of months leading up to the @entity14			1
" even now , at the age of 32 , when i stop by the store and buy five packets , i ca n't wait to get home and open them up , " added @entity84			1
a quick glance at @entity106 , @entity107 and other social media sites , provides a glimpse into the level of addiction that is currently gripping the world			1
the hashtag # gotgotneed -- named after the phrase " got , got need " -- is usually uttered during a sticker swapping session and it 's now one of the most prevalent on @entity106			1
be it on street corners or pubs and cafes , collectors trade at every opportunity , holding swapping sessions and allowing doubles to be discarded for the stickers which have so far proved elusive			1
" i 'm not at peace with myself if i ca n't get my hands on a @entity62 album before the @entity14 , " said @entity129 - @entity130 , who lives in @entity131			1
" it 's a really important part of the whole experience , especially the ' getting ready ' and build up part to the tournament			0
" it 's also a really sociable thing to do because you can swap stickers with your friends			1
" the internet has provided a whole new dimension to the @entity14 sticker craze			1
@entity147 is just one website which collectors can turn to in an effort to find each and every one of the 640 stickers			1
created for the 2006 @entity14 in @entity154 , it now boasts 140,000 registered members who swap stickers online with fellow collectors around the world			1
but swapping stickers in the post can be treacherous -- corners can get folded , faces can be blemished and your reputation can be ruined			1
even within the safety of the home , keeping stickers in perfect condition can be hazardous			2
" we have a three - year - old girl and a one - year - old boy at home , " @entity169 said			0
" my daughter loves the stickers and is always trying to peel them out of the book			2
" my husband is a very mild mannered man but if the kids go near the stickers then he 'll raise his voice			2
" keeping your stickers in mint condition is crucial in maximizing your ability to swap			2
according to @entity187 , the most popular sticker people are looking to collect is @entity188 , the @entity189 and @entity190 defender along with the @entity154 national logo in all its shiny glory			2
but forget about swapping @entity193 -- everybody appears to have the @entity196 and @entity64 goalkeeper in their collection			2
every collector has a nemesis -- just ask @entity201 , an avid collector from @entity202			2
he is starting to feel he is being stalked by @entity204 's @entity203			0
" @entity203 has swiftly become the scourge of my existence , " said @entity201			0
" collecting stickers was an attempt to try and reconnect with my childhood and an innocent love of the game			2
" @entity203 has totally sucked the whole fun out of the whole process , though			0
i have five of him now , and there appears to be no end in sight " the prospect of swapping him for someone exotic or essential to my collection is long gone			0
his five faces are destined to sit on top of my record player for eternity , symbolically gathering dust			0
" for many , 2014 will be the summer of @entity227 , football , flair and joy			2
for me , it will be the summer of @entity203			0
" one man took his love for stickers to a whole new level			2
@entity236 , a @entity237 fan , stumbled upon his 1996 @entity239 sticker album in 2012 and was left devastated to find he was still missing six players			0
the 29 - year - old , who chronicles his quest to complete his collection in his book , " @entity245 : a journey to complete an old sticker album " , traveled far and wide to meet the players who he had failed to find in those hundreds of packets			2
his journey proved successful , meeting the six former @entity239 footballers and completing the book , before tossing the album into the sea in an act he describes as " cathartic			0
" " at the time , i was coming up to 30 , getting married , having a child and it felt like a natural point to take stock of my life , " @entity259 told @entity0			0
" i think for a lot of people , that plays a part in the obsession			2
it allows them the opportunity to wallow in the excitement of their childhood			0
" i think stickers are a metaphor for that -- they are something with a beautiful simplicity			1
" when you 're a kid , it 's a chance to flash your football allegiance and gives you tangible proof to show how into football you are			2
" now , it gives a bizarre and nostalgic feel			0
i guess it 's because it 's something rooted in a particular era and has a timeless quality about it			0
" such is the universal appeal of the product that @entity62 says in total it will sell 239,000 km of stickers - enough to stretch into space			1
" @entity62 has the ability to create nostalgia galore amongst our ' second generation ' collectors , " @entity297 , head of marketing at @entity299 , told @entity0			0
" the media plays a large part			0
we 've had radio @entity310 's collecting live on air , tv programs featuring the collection , and @entity106 going sticker crazy			0
" there have even been secret midnight swapping conventions in @entity315 aided by a beer or two			0
" even the players are at it -- @entity320 striker @entity319 , who was so desperate to find a sticker of himself that he bought a hundred packets			1
but after opening each packet , he was left seething after failing to collect his own picture -- unlike his @entity320 teammate , @entity325			2
the craze is set to continue when the tournament kicks off in @entity329 on june 12 with @entity330 hosting @entity331 in the opening fixture			0
@entity169 is already resigned to losing the attention of her husband , @entity39 , for the duration of the tournament -- even if he 's finished his sticker album by then			2
" i wo n't exist once it all starts , " she jokes			0
" we 've been together 10 years so i know exactly what to expect and i 'm sure he 'll try to get the kids watching with him			0
" his brother is going to @entity330 so he 's got a bit of envy but he 'll be watching all the games			0
" and he 'll be making sure the kids do n't go anywhere near the stickers too ! "			0
