the @entity5 in @entity2 said it expects waves 40 - to - 50 - feet high to hit the north shore of @entity8 on wednesday , driven by " a giant northwest swell			1
" @entity2 has n't experienced waves that large since 2004 , said @entity11 , a forecaster with the weather service			0
a high - surf warning is in effect for much of the state until friday morning and forecasters say " giant breaking surf , " dangerous currents and significant " coastal inundation " are possible			2
at first glance , the tall waves would appear to offer a golden opportunity for participants in a big wave surf contest that was scheduled to take place wednesday on @entity8			1
but the organizers have postponed the event			1
they say that although the waves are expected to be pleasingly large , the wind conditions are no good			1
eastern @entity30 gets hit with bitter cold " we have taken all the time we can to assess the developments of the next big swell and it does not look favorable for us , " said event organizer @entity32			1
" the size is there , but the quality is not , due to strong , adverse winds			2
" @entity42 's 50 best surf spots organizers of the big wave event said they will keep waiting until the end of february for " just one day of quality surf " when wave face heights reach around 40 feet			1
the contest is held in honor of @entity50 , a famous @entity8 lifeguard who was regarded as one of the best big wave surfers of the 1960s and ' 70s			1

" it is a pretty awesome sight to see , " said @entity84 , emergency management officer on the island			0

why such huge waves ? a large storm with hurricane - force winds is spinning far north of the islands , but is sending a giant swell toward the warning areas , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity101			2
