he sits without apparent expression			0
who is he ? that 's the question historians are trying to answer after a collection surfaced of some 450 photo booth portraits , taken of the same man over what appears to be decades			1
no one knows who he is or why he made , and kept , the photographs			1
" not knowing is very mysterious			0
it 's like an abstract painting			2
you 're going to fill in the blanks yourself			0
you bring to it what you know , and if we do n't know anything , we sort of make up a story , " said @entity17 , a photography historian and owner of the collection			2
the photographs are being shown as part of " striking resemblance : the @entity29 , " an exhibition on display through july at @entity32 at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity17 bought the prints a year or two ago at an antiques show in @entity38			1
he was immediately drawn to the images and to the mystery behind them			2
the photographs were taken in a @entity44 photo booth			1
most have metal frames , though some of the later ones have either cardboard or plastic frames			0
@entity51 guesses the photographs were made over a roughly 30 - year period , starting in the 1930s			1
he speculates on why the man made so many and talks about the prints ' appeal			1
" he was either hooked on self - portraits and kind of wanted to see himself in a photograph constantly , or he worked for the company maintaining the machine , " said @entity17			2
the theory that he worked in maintenance for the photo booth company mirrors the plot of the @entity68 film " @entity69 , " as @entity0 readers have noted			1
" it 's the same guy , and he 's getting a little older , and a little older and a little older			2
then his hair is messed up , then his hair is neat			0
then he 's smiling a little bit , then he 's not smiling			2
then he 's wearing a winter jacket , then he 's wearing a sports jacket , " @entity17 said			2
" it 's just so familiar			2
it 's like looking at yourself in the mirror every morning			1
" a potential lead after purchasing the photographs , @entity17 got curious about where they might have come from			0
he got in touch with @entity87 , author of " @entity88			0
" besides being a wealth of knowledge about that particular chapter of @entity93 history , @entity87 owns some images of the same man			1
turns out , the people who sold @entity97 the collection had previously sold a few of the photographs on @entity101			1
@entity87 bought those prints , which stand out because unlike the 445 that @entity51 has , @entity87 's photographs show the man with children			1
she tracked down the sellers , who told her the photographs came from an auction in @entity109			0
" i have a strong suspicion who the gentleman is , " said @entity87 , " but i 'm not 100 % sure			0
" she declined to give the name of the man she thinks appears in the photographs until she can do more research			1
selfies show ' ongoing portrait ' zimmerli curator @entity119 believes that having a story to go along with the man 's face would be interesting			1
" having a name to attach to the face would maybe in a way close the book on it , but on the other hand , might open a new book or a new chapter , " she said			0
@entity119 and @entity97 are friends			0
she knew as soon as he showed her the photographs she wanted them for her portraiture exhibition			0
@entity119 says she does n't really have a favorite from the collection			0
" what i love the most is how all of them sort of blend into an ongoing portrait of someone over time , " she said			0
@entity119 also loves the mystery			0
" we just really do n't know much about the man except that he seems to have enjoyed having his photo -- his selfie -- done , and he saved them all , " she said			1
" he seems like such an average guy , but this clearly sort of catapults him out of average into really interesting because why would he do this ? and how is it possible that we have 445 pictures of a man and we know nothing about him ? "			0
