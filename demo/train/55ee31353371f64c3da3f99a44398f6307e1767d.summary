it 's probably not the kind of thing voters will use to choose the leader of the free world			2
but the @entity5 was taking no shortage of presidential potshots wednesday over @entity10 candidate @entity9 's new mobile app , which embarrassingly misspelled " @entity11			1
" sorry about the shaking @entity21 , that was just the rest of @entity11 laughing at @entity9 running for @entity23 of # @entity24 , " wrote a person behind a parody president @entity17 account on @entity18 ( referencing a minor earthquake late tuesday )			1
the gaffe , presumably by some poor developer hired by the campaign , appears on " with @entity9 , " the campaign 's newly released @entity29 app. the app invites users to photograph themselves with their choice of 14 pro-romney slogans such as " i 'm a mom for @entity9 , " " @entity17 is n't working " and " the @entity11 we love , " and then share them on social media			1
but one of the slogans reads , " a @entity24			1
somebody did n't observe the " @entity41 " rule			0
an update to the " with @entity9 " app , with the typo corrected , became available at about 1 p.m. on wednesday			1
no one with the campaign was speaking on the record about it , but staffers were downplaying its importance in the run - up to november			2
by wednesday afternoon , the campaign also had paid for a " promoted tweet " that appears when a @entity18 users searches for " @entity24			1
" slips of the tongue by political candidates are , of course , not uncommon			0
in 2008 , then - candidate @entity17 got grief for saying he 'd visited " all 57 states			0
" and vice president @entity65 's free - speaking nature has gotten him no shortage of headlines			0
but the @entity5 's politically minded ( many of whom , presumably , do n't consider @entity9 their top choice ) , were noting that when a mistake appears in writing , it shows a lack of attention to detail			0
" if you 're applying for a job , and you misspell the name of the company you want to work for , you wo n't get that job			0
# @entity82 , " wrote a @entity18 user			0
" @entity86 " was a trending topic ( meaning it 's one of the most discussed terms ) on @entity18 late tuesday and again wednesday morning			2
the typo has already also inspired its own @entity89 blog , " @entity24 is with @entity9			1
" it features photos created with the app and , as of wednesday morning , included a group of spelling bee champions , @entity95 from " @entity96 " and @entity97 , the @entity99 mascot , among its subjects			1
and numerous images were popping up on @entity102 -- one highlight being @entity104 having to write the correctly spelled " @entity11 " during his iconic chalkboard gag from the intro to " @entity107			0
" to be honest , the @entity9 camp is probably more pleased at winning enough delegates in the @entity111 primaries tuesday to make him the unofficial @entity10 nominee than it is worried about a spelling gaffe			0
and it 's worth noting that lots of folks who support @entity9 probably only learned that the app exists because of talk about the typo .			2

@entity29 app goes viral with misspelled " @entity24 "
the campaign app lets users take and share photos with @entity127 slogans
the typo has been the butt of jokes on social media
update : campaign issued an updated *version* of the app wednesday that fixed problem
