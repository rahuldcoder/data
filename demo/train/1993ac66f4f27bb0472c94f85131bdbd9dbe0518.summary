a rigorous green certification system is recognizing the next phase of eco design , which its founders describe as " the world 's greenest buildings			1
" founded by @entity7 in 2006 through the @entity8 , the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) is a green ratings system for design and construction that judges a building based on its actual performance , not just its projected performance at the design stage			1
to date , it has recognized six buildings for their green credentials			1
only three have been successful in meeting all its stringent requirements and consequently fully certified as " living			0
" " these are the world 's greenest buildings , " says @entity7			2
" it is a huge leap forward from conventional green construction			2
these buildings will never get an energy or water bill again			0
" projects must be in operation for a minimum of 12 months before they become eligible to participate in the challenge and they can only achieve " living " status after fulfilling requirements in the categories of site , water , energy , health , materials , equity and beauty			0
" it takes about 14 - 16 months to go through the certification process and we are a rigorous process so there are not that many buildings fully certified , " says @entity7			2

they create a whole community of changed people around them			2
" the @entity57 , a non-profit that was created to take over running the @entity6 since its inception , hopes its guidelines will change current green construction philosophy and become as powerful as eco-building ratings system @entity61 , or @entity61 as it is better known			1
but unlike @entity6 , @entity61 does not certify new buildings based on measurements of their actual performance			1
@entity7 says : " you 'd be surprised no green standards actually go and check if the project is fulfilling what they had planned to do			2
we knew in reality buildings typically do n't perform the way they are intended so we wanted to rectify this and base our challenge on reality			0
" the @entity6 was created to encourage the creation of living buildings , sites and communities globally as well as educate people about the importance of going green			1
the non-profit has been working closely with projects and regulatory bodies to aid experimental green design construction			0

in the official statement , the jurors said the " @entity6 successfully shows how humans and their built environment can be harmoniously , benignly integrated within ecosystems			1
" above all , its rigorous standards and daringly innovative , revolutionary approach to building are already having a considerable impact on the thinking of designers and architects around the world , influencing all levels of design and technological approaches , radically pushing forward the field			0

he says : " without any international marketing budget , we 've launched something bigger than ourselves			0
we have become a meme in a way -- an idea that develops its own legs and begins to travel			0
" initially starting with projects in the @entity129 and @entity130 , the green performance - based ratings system now has registered projects in @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity137 , amongst others , and interest from like - minded groups in @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			1
" we hope to be training certifiers in those countries , " says @entity7			0
" in @entity133 , we have three projects that are underway			0
we are in discussions with many leading thinkers about ideas working to create the @entity133 institute			0
" they would be the governing body for the @entity152 tied into a global network of ambassadors , collaboratives and institutes around the world for the transformation of society ... it 's about changing the world and building a network of people			1

the @entity6 is a performance - based green ratings system
the @entity57 also aims to educate people on *sustainability*
*organizers* hope to change people 's *attitudes* to the environment
