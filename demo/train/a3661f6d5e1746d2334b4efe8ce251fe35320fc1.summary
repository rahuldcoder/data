-- you can almost hear them now			0
the throngs descending on @entity4 , ready to devour as much pop culture as they can possibly muster over an extra-long weekend			1
officially , the @entity4 begins on thursday of next week			1
but , there is that magical time known as @entity10 on wednesday , when the number one , two and three items on the agenda are to snag as many exclusive goodies as possible ... namely , toys ! comic - con exclusives tend to be nostalgic in nature , and @entity18 's " @entity17 " of " @entity21 " figures -- revealed for the first time on @entity0 -- is no exception			1
in honor of " @entity26 's " 30th anniversary , the toy company is adding to the 2008 line of figures , including two new versions of @entity21 and one of @entity31			1
@entity32 , chief marketing officer with @entity18 , explained that these figures were never released in stores as planned in 2008			1
" they truly are a special edition , because it was never made available to the public , " he said			0
" it ties right into what collectors at @entity4 are looking for , which is something unique , something special , something that no one else has			1
" the major and smaller toy companies have been offering up exclusives as part of the explosion in interest in the convention over the past five years			0
" it 's really a unique event , " said @entity32			0
" it 's a special chance for many elements of our company to interact with people that have a special passion for these brands			0
" the new @entity21 figures are sure to get fans drooling at @entity4 , and here are five more toys that should fly off shelves on @entity10			1
-- " @entity65 " @entity64 vehicle fellow toy giant @entity66 also has a major presence on the convention floor , and this year the company is offering fans their very own " @entity64 " version of a @entity71 from the movie " @entity65			1
" the best part of this , however , is the packaging			0
it 's a mini-version of the briefcase in which dr. @entity78 kept the plutonium ! ( as for sending the @entity71 back to the future -- or the past -- you 'll have to figure out how to get it up to 88 mph first			0
) " this is a 1/64 scale time machine , which comes in its own plastic display case right in front of the clock tower , with flames coming out of the tires just like it 's jumping into time , " said @entity84 , manager of @entity85 at @entity66 and a collector in his own right			1
the exclusives like these cater to the hardcore fans , as opposed to casual collectors of all ages			2
" we look very carefully at what brands we have that play up to the key demographics at @entity4 , " said @entity84			2
" obviously not every brand is appropriate for @entity4			2
we will go with the obvious " low - hanging fruit " brands like @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
@entity64 is not necessarily a comic - con brand , but when you apply it to a sci - fi , geekdom vehicle , like the @entity114 , then it becomes a great item for @entity4			2
" -- the " @entity117 " collection taking its name from the original title of " @entity117 , " this collection includes special versions of " @entity117 " characters @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and an @entity125 who serves drinks			0
-- @entity128 with @entity129 this one will basically blow the minds of fans who grew up in the 1980s			0
here we have what is a version of the " @entity136 " character @entity135 being piloted by @entity129			0
" we 're mashing up ' transformers ' and ' @entity138 , ' " said @entity32			0
" we 're giving the @entity140 plane from ' @entity138 ' a custom makeover and making it the @entity135			0
fans of both franchises really like it when we do this type of mashup			0
" -- @entity148 this year , @entity66 will be introducing its very first @entity148 figure at the @entity4 , for those who look back fondly at the anime character from the 1980s ( recently brought back on a current @entity153 series )			1
" obviously , there have been many other @entity148 figures in the past			1
what we 're offering is the first ever 6 - inch scale @entity148 , " said @entity84			2
" this figure makes @entity148 at the same size with other figures that collectors may have			1
" best of all , @entity148 comes with his blazing sword			2
-- " @entity166 aside from the nostalgia factor , there are some more recent properties that do well on @entity10			1
last year 's " @entity166 " bobblehead was a hot seller for smaller toy company @entity172			1
this year , they 've created a @entity166 action figure complete with its own card packaging showing star @entity176			1
" @entity180 's @entity179 " is certainly for the grownup collectors out there			0
whether you 're there to relive a part of your childhood or celebrate genre entertainment in the present , fans can usually find at least one thing that they 're dying to part with their hard - earned money to get , and in the age of fan conventions , companies continue to tailor their special - release toys like these to what the geek crowd wants			0
so if your colleague comes back to work after his trip to @entity202 with a bobblehead tardis , now you know it came from @entity10 .			2

fans look *forward* to @entity4 exclusives every year
the best time to get exclusives are on wednesday , @entity10
