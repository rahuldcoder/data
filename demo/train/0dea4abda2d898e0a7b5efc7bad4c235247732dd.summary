two fraternities at the @entity2 say they wo n't sign an agreement dictating new safety procedures after a student 's claim of being gang raped			1

in november , the university suspended all fraternities and associated parties until this month after a @entity22 article about the student 's claims			1
despite scrutiny of the article 's depiction of the alleged rape of a then - @entity2 freshman , identified in the article as @entity32 , the university stuck to its promise to review how sexual assault is handled and to make @entity36 life safer			1
@entity2 gave its fraternity members until friday to sign the agreement if they wanted to have the suspension lifted			1
but @entity40 and @entity41 released statements on their national fraternity letterhead saying they would not do so			0
they said the university unfairly punished members of @entity36 life when it uniformly suspended social activities two days after the @entity22 article was published , and said they are concerned the demands will create new liability and " set a dangerous precedent of an erosion of student and organizational rights			1
" instead , both fraternities plan to ignore the new rules set by @entity2 and resume activities			1
the university said the rules were developed by student groups and said it wo n't comment until after the friday deadline for fraternities to sign the agreement has passed			2
a source familiar with the thinking of the national fraternities said this could result in litigation if @entity2 tries to limit the fraternities that wo n't sign the new agreement			2
the @entity69 reports that @entity70 is one of the fraternities that signed the agreement and remains committed to improving safety during events			0
@entity32 told @entity22 that she was assaulted by seven men at a @entity70 party			2
in the weeks that followed the article , the @entity69 and other news organizations began scrutinizing the details of @entity32 's story			0
@entity1 spoke to @entity32 's friends , who told a different version of events from that night , and @entity70 produced records that seemed to dispute what she said happened			0
@entity90 @entity89 investigated after the story was printed , and said earlier this week that police found no " substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the @entity22 article occurred at @entity70			1
" police have not said whether they believe @entity32 was raped			0
@entity22 apologized and launched an investigation of its own			0
the magazine editor acknowledged that the writer never contacted some of the witnesses or any of the accused .			0
