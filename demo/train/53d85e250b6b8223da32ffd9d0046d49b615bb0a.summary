-- in a remarkably tight race , @entity1 : the desolation of @entity4 held onto its gold at the box office this weekend , earning $ 29.9 million over the three - day frame and taking the top spot			1
the fantasy epic 's domestic total is now $ 190.3 million after three weeks , a robust number that still trails last year 's @entity1 : an @entity12 , which had already earned $ 221.6 million at the 17 - day mark			1
@entity16 's earlier @entity15 epic , @entity17 : @entity18 , had made a princely $ 290.4 million by its third weekend in 2003 , headed toward a final gross of $ 377.8 in the states and $ 1.119 billion worldwide			2
smaug looks likely to end up below @entity12 's total haul of $ 303 million , whereas each of the @entity17 films managed to outgross its predecessor			0
the @entity1 : @entity1 , the trilogy 's final film , is slated for release on dec. 17 , 2014			1
the prize for @entity30 this week goes to @entity31 , which jumped a remarkable 46.9 percent in its sixth weekend — despite actually playing at 205 fewer theaters			1
@entity35 's animated musical made $ 28.9 over the three - day weekend , raising its total to $ 248.4 million			1
it 's already the seventh highest - grossing film of 2013 and looks likely to overtake @entity38 ( $ 254.6 million ) and @entity39 ( $ 268.5 million ) in the weeks to come			2
@entity35 's last princess tale , 2010 @entity41 , had a similar box office bump in 2010 , when it jumped 52.5 percent during the @entity44 weekend , although the movie 's total at that point was just $ 167.8 million on its way to a $ 200 million cume			1
box office update : ' @entity51 ' and ' @entity52 ' on friday in its second weekend , @entity54 : @entity54 earned $ 20.2 million for a total $ 83.7 million			1
( worldwide estimated gross for the $ 50 million comedy is $ 108.2 million			0
) that 's a slightly faster clip than the original anchorman : the legend of @entity60 , which had earned $ 57 million total by its second weekend in 2004			2
its domestic total was $ 85 million — a number the sequel should surpass by midweek			0
even more promising is the fact that the original anchorman made just $ 5.3 million at the foreign box office , while anchorman 2 has already earned $ 24.5 million			1
riding a wave of critical acclaim , @entity72 earned $ 19.6 million over the three - day weekend for a running total $ 60 million			2
the @entity76 production has been in wide release for two weekends , following a debut weekend in limited			1
last year 's @entity80 — which was also directed by @entity81 and costarred @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 — did n't really go wide until its 10th weekend			1
thanks to huge critical kudos ( including @entity88 ) that movie eventually grossed $ 132.1 million — a number that 's certainly in @entity72 's sights considering the film 's intense @entity88 buzz and guaranteed exposure at the @entity94 , where it 's nominated for seven awards , including @entity97 , @entity98			0
@entity100 box office report : ' @entity1 ' beats out ' @entity101 ' in a tight race making money might 've been easy for @entity104 , the wildly successful white collar criminal played by @entity106 in @entity107 of @entity52			1
but his biopic is having a slightly tougher time			0
the @entity111 drama , which cost just shy of $ 100 million to make , cashed in $ 18.5 million over the three - day weekend , bringing its five - day total to $ 34.3 million			2
@entity113 predictably played to an older male audience , drawing a crowd that was 54 percent male and 90 percent over the age of 25			0
the movie 's box office future is uncertain : while its straight - @entity120 does n't imply good word - of - mouth , @entity113 stands to get plenty of free publicity at upcoming awards events			1
( the movie has already garnered @entity94 nominations for @entity97 , musical or comedy and best actor in a @entity128 )			0
@entity106 had much better luck at the holiday box office last year			1
like @entity113 , @entity133 opened on christmas day			0
but the @entity135 film made $ 15 million on the 25th alone , and had racked up a solid $ 63.4 million tally by the end of the weekend			0
earlier this year , the actor 's @entity138 made $ 50.1 million in its opening weekend in may			2
and @entity111 and @entity106 's last pairing , @entity141 , opened to $ 41.1 million in february of 2010			0
the @entity1 : the @entity142 - $ 29.9 million 2			1
frozen - $ 28.9 million 3			2
anchorman 2 : the legend continues -- $ 20.2 million 4			0
@entity72 -- $ 19.6 million 5			0
the @entity101 -- $ 18.5 million outside the top five , the weekend 's biggest story was @entity148 's @entity147 , the long - delayed , $ 175 million @entity150 samurai epic that grossed just $ 9.9 million over the three - day weekend , bringing its five - day total to $ 20.6 million			1
@entity148 has announced that it will take a write - down to absorb the movie 's failure , although the studio is still having its best year yet thanks to giant hits like @entity157 , and @entity158			2
@entity160 's audience was 62 percent male , and the movie earned a not - bad b + @entity120			1
@entity164 's @entity163 , starring @entity165 and @entity166 , made $ 13 million this weekend at 2,909 theaters for a $ 25.6 million five - day gross			2

in the big - screen showdown between @entity84 and @entity176 , the loser was ...			0
their movie @entity179 , which took in just $ 7.3 million this weekend for a $ 13.44 million total			0
but the weekend 's lowest scoring wide - release belonged to @entity182 , whose concert doc believe took in a mere $ 2 million			1
the film 's reported budget is only $ 5 million , so that 's not a huge loss — although it pales in comparison to the $ 29.5 million debut of @entity182 's last pic , 2011 ′ s @entity191			1
the weekend also had a few notable specialty releases , including the @entity195 - @entity194 dramedy august : @entity196 , which took in $ 179,500 from five theaters for a healthy per - screen average of $ 35,900			2
@entity148 's military thriller @entity200 , starring @entity201 and @entity202 , earned $ 92,000 from two theaters in a qualifying run , leading up to a planned nationwide expansion on jan. 10			0
