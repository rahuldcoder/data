-- environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places			2
for the answer to our global waste management crisis , we need only look as far as our back gardens , for example			2
forty million manure worms are being put to use in @entity9 to treat its sewage			0
that 's what proponents of vermicomposting will tell us , anyway			1
vermicomposting is the art of composting using worms -- and it is worms , apparently , who could save us yet			0
worms are nature 's waste disposal units			1
or rather , it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units , as they do n't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful : nutrient - rich compost			1
earthworms are by any definition incredible creatures -- particularly , in this context : the @entity37 and @entity36 , which are the two breeds of worm commonly used in vermicomposting , according to @entity41			1
not only can they eat their own body weight in organic waste every day , but they actually remove -- or neutralize -- many of the toxins in that waste in the process , according to @entity49			1
there are a lot of them , too			0
you will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land , according to @entity57 , their population doubling in size every one - two months			0
and they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves , stems and dead roots in one year , ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process			0
what they end up producing is ready - to - go plant soluble nutrients			0
according to @entity57 , earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen , seven times as much phosphorous , 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more " beneficial bacteria " than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place			1
literally speaking , what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out			0
utilizing ' black gold ' it is no surprise why these worms ' byproducts are often referred to as " black gold , " this knowledge being particularly pertinent at a time when nearly 40 percent of the world 's agricultural soil has become " seriously degraded , " according to the @entity92 @entity91			1
worm compost : just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days , according to @entity98			0
research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting , by as much as 40 percent for broccoli , 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots , according to @entity49			1
according to the @entity109 , compiled by @entity110 , we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004			1
and a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted			1
around 32 percent of the @entity116 's annual municipal waste ( around 120 million tons ) is food and garden waste , according to @entity119			1
and 30 percent of @entity121 waste could have been composted in 2000 , according to the @entity121 @entity122 ( @entity122 ) -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill , emitting methane into the atmosphere			1
as local governments and companies grapple with the issue of how to safely dispose of waste , vermicomposting is finding new fans -- some in unusual places			1
in @entity139 , none other than fast - food chain @entity136 has signed up to a vermicomposting program that will have 80 million worms feasting on between 50 and 200 tons of organic waste a day , according to the @entity144 news service			1
@entity136 's aims to decrease the amount of waste it sends to @entity139 's rapidly filling landfills by 80 percent , @entity144 reports			1
other companies to have experimented with worm composting include @entity150 in the @entity121 state of @entity152 , where , according to @entity154 , it is conducting vermicomposting trials			1
if all goes well , it aims to use worm composting to boost its 70 percent recycling rates to 90 percent , the site says			2
as it happens , we have had this knowledge for centuries			0
aristotle himself was even said to have called worms the " intestines of the soil , " according to the @entity165 , which also points out that @entity166 was another devotee , bestowing sacred status on them and ordering them protected			0
@entity172 admired their land - tilling abilities so much that he wrote a book on them			0
" it may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures , " he mused , according to the @entity165			0
greenhouse gas emitters what @entity172 , @entity166 or @entity185 could not have known however , is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste			0
scientists in @entity192 have found that worms ' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic - free manure			0
according to the @entity192 newspaper , @entity192 together , researchers in @entity199 have found that worms can " detox " the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste			2
the method is ideal for industries -- such as paper , food processing , oil , textiles , dairy , distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge , @entity192 researchers say			0
but even with vermicomposting , something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around , there 's a downside -- and it 's a rather large one			2
it turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide			0
unfortunately , in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , large - scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size , reports the @entity92 's @entity241 newspaper			2
" the emissions that come from these worms can actually be 290 times more potent than carbon dioxide and 20 times more potent than methane , " the @entity241 quotes @entity242 , an @entity243 research fellow			0
" in all environmental systems you get good points and bad points			2
