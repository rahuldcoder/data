@entity0 , @entity1 -- my best friend from childhood is @entity7 - @entity6			1
so when @entity8 invites me to visit the @entity9 , i do n't ask questions			1
arrive early or make reservations to sample @entity0 's pizza			1
we head out of @entity15 , @entity1 , toward @entity0 , population approximately 10,000			1
in about 10 minutes we 're driving down @entity17			2
i start counting the pizza cafés , as they call them here : @entity8 's , @entity20 's , @entity21 & @entity22 's , @entity23 's , @entity24 's -- 11 on this street alone			1
within just a few blocks , there are at least nine more			2
even the florist on @entity17 is called " pizzazz			2
" @entity8 said we would need reservations , and she 's right			2
it 's 4:30 p.m. and @entity33 's is packed			2
the place attracts locals and celebrities			2
@entity37 was here a couple of weeks ago			2
just for fun we ask if we can sit in the booth where she sat. " no problem , honey , " the waitress , @entity44 , says			2
now , if you are thinking regular pizza , forget it			1
this is @entity0 pizza and all the cafés here make it			1
it 's not round , it 's rectangular and it 's " red " or " white			1
" @entity52 is made with tomato sauce and cheese ; white is cheese only , double crust , with olive oil and rosemary sprinkled on top , although they recently introduced a new version with broccoli			1
@entity0 also is famous for " black " pizza , my favorite			1
just cheese , black pepper , olives and anchovies			2
while @entity44 is getting our sodas , i meet @entity33			0
he 's the co-owner with his mother , @entity74			0
his parents bought the café 41 years ago			1
i ask him if they have the best pizza in town			1
no one here in town claims to be the best			0
there 's very little competition			0
after all , @entity0 , @entity33 says , is a place " where everyone knows your name			1
" " well , it 's really a matter of taste , " he tells me			0
the pizza café owners in @entity0 are a loyal bunch			1
most of their families originally came from the same town in @entity98 -- @entity99 , near @entity100			1
they named their town the " @entity9			1
" no one is " best , " they say			0
they 're all " the best			0
" so , what make the best pizza in the world ? @entity33 takes me back to the kitchen			1
@entity111 , who has worked here for 40 years , is sprinkling grated cheese on a " red " pizza			1
next to him is a stack of pizza crusts			1
he 's the brother of the owner			0
of the café 's 25 employees , three - quarters of them are related			2
i ask @entity111 for the secret of great pizza			2
" it 's the cheese blend , " he says			0
" so what kind do you use ? " i ask			0
" we make our own , " he says , " we have to keep our secrets			0
" @entity33 tells me they use only fresh ingredients and grind their own @entity133 tomatoes			0
they still use the original cheese grater from 40 years ago			0
local legend has it that @entity0 pizza began 88 years ago with grandmother @entity139 , whose family restaurant , @entity139 's , still stands on @entity17			1
mrs. @entity139 lived below a gentlemen 's club where the clients played cards			0
they asked her for something to eat			0
she grabbed a rectangular baking pan and baked a pizza on the old coal stove			1
today , some @entity0 cafés ship their pizza across the country and around the world			1
it 's 5:30 p.m. and the line of customers at @entity33 's is out the front door			0
at the back door there 's a crowd waiting for takeout			0
@entity33 tells me his first worker gets in at 5 a.m. to make the dough			0
" once the dough starts rising , the people come in , " he says			0
@entity44 comes by to freshen up our drinks			0
she 's on the run , trying to keep the customers happy			0
" i wish i had another hand instead of a mouth , " she says			0

@entity0 , @entity1 , calls itself the @entity9
most of the pizza café owners ' relatives came from @entity99 , @entity98
the pizza is rectangular with a thick crust
