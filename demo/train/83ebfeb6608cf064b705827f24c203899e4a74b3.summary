@entity0 -- it was a rare sight for media watchers on wednesday : @entity4 , the indomitable head of the @entity7 empire , called before a judicial inquiry to explain how his influence has shaped @entity11 's media and political landscape			1
still , it 's not the first time the 81 - year - old chairman of @entity7 has been grilled in the @entity11			1
he also appeared before lawmakers last summer to answer questions on alleged phone hacking at the @entity20			0
but the focus in the @entity23 hearing was on @entity4 's dealings with a succession of @entity11 prime ministers going back decades and whether these cozy relationships worked to his personal advantage			1
the awkward questions come as @entity7 also faces investigation in the @entity32 over alleged phone hacking and increased scrutiny in @entity34 following an inquiry into media standards			1
on the stand in @entity0 , @entity4 insisted that his newspapers did not lobby for his commercial interests and he had " never asked a prime minister for anything			1
" " you would wish to point out that no express favors were offered to you by @entity44 ; is that right ? " he was asked by @entity23 lawyer @entity45 , referring to former prime minister @entity44			1
" and none asked , " responded @entity4			2
@entity4 denies political influence the question of influence is key because of the concerns raised over the impartiality of culture secretary @entity52 in considering a takeover bid by @entity7 for @entity11 satellite broadcaster @entity54			1
@entity52 's aide resigned wednesday over communications with @entity7 that suggested the global media giant was getting inside information , although @entity52 denied any improper dealings on his own part			2
' this is a man who has held power ... ' and it 's significant in part because of the sheer scale of @entity7 's operations in the @entity11 , the @entity32 , @entity34 and elsewhere			1
with some 48,000 employees worldwide , the company " had total assets of approximately @entity32 $ 60 billion , total annual revenues of approximately u.s. $ 34 billion and in excess of 260,000 shareholders " as of the end of last year , @entity4 said in written testimony			2
" this is a man who has held power far greater and far longer than anyone else in our time , " said @entity77 , a media commentator , founder of @entity78 and author of " the man who owns the news : inside the @entity88 of @entity4			2
" for 60 years , @entity4 has been both a powerful private citizen in the @entity11 , @entity32 and @entity34 , and a businessman wielding huge influence , @entity77 said			1
" he is so powerful that he does n't have to ask for anything ... it just comes to him , " he said			0
@entity7 , through its @entity11 arm @entity94 , commands some 37 % of national newspaper circulation in @entity11			2
it publishes the @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity98 on sunday newspapers given that about 60 % of the @entity11 population reads a national newspaper , @entity4 's influence is hard to overstate , said @entity103 , professor of communications at the @entity104 in @entity0			1
his attitudes on issues including the @entity107 , opposition to a single currency , taxation and immigration have percolated down to the @entity11 population through his titles , as they shape the news agenda , @entity103 said			2
and the @entity98 readership matters more than most in political terms because it has six to seven million readers , @entity103 said , and polling shows many of these are floating voters			0
@entity4 critic : publisher 's claims are ' pretty ludicrous ' against this backdrop , @entity4 's claims never to have sought to capitalize on that reach for his own benefit are disingenuous at best , @entity103 said			1
" time after time , @entity4 insisted on denying that he ever used his newspapers either for commercial advantage or for political advantage , which is quite extraordinary -- and frankly as a claim is pretty ludicrous , " said @entity103 , who attended the hearing in @entity0			1
" when you look at the history of the way in which he increased his empire and the legislative and regulatory decisions that have been made in his favor , it just does n't stand up to scrutiny			0
" in his role as chief executive of a multinational media giant , it would have been remiss of @entity4 not to seek the ear of power if it would benefit his shareholders , @entity103 said , and his claim that he never did is " frankly beyond belief			2
" at the same time as @entity4 was testifying , prime minister @entity148 told the @entity149 : " i think we all , on both sides of this house , did a bit too much cozying up to mr. @entity4			1
" going back to the @entity44 era , @entity103 points to the government 's decision not to refer @entity4 's acquisition of the @entity96 and @entity97 to the @entity158 , despite his ownership of other titles , as a prime example of things working in the press baron 's favor			1
secret lunch with @entity44 the @entity23 heard how @entity4 had a secret lunch with @entity44 -- revealed in march this year -- before his successful bid for the @entity96 newspapers			2
questioned over his relations with other @entity11 leaders , @entity4 recounted falling out with former prime minister @entity171 after he told @entity171 his papers would not support @entity173 in the 2010 election			1
but he insisted strongly that there had been no quid pro quo with @entity177 as @entity4 's papers switched support from the @entity180 to @entity177 's @entity173 in 1997 -- not long before @entity177 swept into power as prime minister			1
" i , in 10 years in his power there , never asked @entity177 for any favors and never received any , " @entity4 said			2
nonetheless , the relationship with @entity7 has been key to @entity11 's politicians , @entity103 said			1
" it was incredibly important for @entity177 when they decided to support @entity173 , @entity177 in 1997 , and also when they supported @entity148 and the @entity180			0
" while @entity7 's dominance in the @entity11 media market is indisputable , it accounts for only 8 % of the company 's overall revenue			1
@entity4 owns 70 % of the newspapers in his native @entity34 , @entity77 said , where his @entity199 division owns the only national daily paper and daily titles in several big cities			1
" he has an overwhelming share of power there			0
it became such an easy game there that he left , it was a boring game , " @entity77 said			0
@entity32 -- where the real money is but the real money is in the @entity32 , where @entity7 controls the @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity214 publishers , among other interests			2
" he has more power than any other private citizen in the @entity32 , " said @entity77			0
@entity7 's outlets in @entity32 are a kind of throwback to the 19th century , when nearly every newspaper had an overt political affiliation , @entity220 sociologist @entity219 said			1
when the tea party movement began to coalesce in opposition to president @entity228 in 2009 , @entity4 's @entity212 in particular helped boost it to national prominence , she said			1
" @entity212 was overtly orchestrating enthusiasm for big events and passing along information along with bloggers and radio hosts , " said @entity219 , co-author of a 2011 book on the movement			0
" they did n't create the tea party -- the people who were upset about @entity228 and @entity241 and not happy with the @entity242 , either , were out there			0
but you can have people out there who do n't necessarily get that much help that quickly			0
" the network drew fire from the @entity228 administration in 2009 , when then - communications director @entity251 called it " the communications arm of the @entity242			0
" @entity253 shot back that it keeps its conservative - leaning opinion programming separate from its " fair and balanced " news coverage			0
while @entity7 's @entity32 organs have a more consistently conservative conservative cast than in @entity11 , @entity219 said , " they 're a commercial entity , and they 're trying to do things that sell			1
" " we 're in an era now where flamboyant commentators , particularly on the right , have a great deal of leverage in @entity32 politics , and sometimes you wonder whether they 're in politics or they 're just selling themselves , " @entity219 said			0
their only weakness , she said , is that @entity212 viewers tend to be older -- a minus for advertisers			0
@entity276 , a former editor of the @entity97 under @entity4 , said the media baron -- who became a @entity32 citizen in 1985 -- had been heavily coached by his @entity211 lawyers on how not to jeopardize those vital @entity32 interests through intemperate outbursts in @entity0			1
" he must n't do anything in the @entity32 , where his real money is and where he is under investigation by the @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 , " @entity276 said			0
as a result , little new came out of the @entity23 hearing , @entity276 said , only a kind of " false modesty " as @entity4 sought to downplay his influence			0
' i do n't think they laid a glove on him ' for @entity77 , the only surprise from the @entity23 was that " at 81 years old , ( @entity4 ) can still be as indominable as ever " under questioning			0
" i do n't think they laid a glove on him			0
at the end of the day , they looked like schoolchildren , and he looked like the master			0
" that said , the fact @entity4 was before the @entity23 at all reveals a significant lessening of his power in @entity11 , @entity77 said			2
" his @entity11 enterprise is imploding			0
it is over for @entity4 in the @entity11			2
i think he knows that he can salvage nothing , but he would like his son not to go to jail			0
" the son in question , @entity315 , a senior @entity7 executive who was chairman of @entity94 at the time of the alleged phone hacking but has since resigned from that role , testified before the inquiry tuesday			2
he denies knowing about the extent of wrongdoing at the @entity20			0
as for his father , he will be back on the stand thursday			0
no doubt every media watcher will be glued to @entity4 's words once again , waiting to see if the man synonymous with ruthless journalism and tough business practice lets his guard drop and tells all			1
@entity1 's @entity332 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 denies giving politicians favorable coverage in return for commercial advantage
he has " never asked a prime minister for anything , " he told a @entity11 inquiry into press ethics
@entity4 owns huge chunks of the @entity11 , @entity32 and @entity34 media markets
@entity4 's @entity7 also faces tough questions in the @entity32 and @entity34
