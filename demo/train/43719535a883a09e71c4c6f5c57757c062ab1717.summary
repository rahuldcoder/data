@entity4 had set a lap record in saturday 's qualifying for the @entity13 , but was upstaged from the start by his fellow @entity15 and had to settle for second place as he spent most of the race holding off his rookie @entity19 teammate @entity18			1
@entity1 followed up his victory in @entity22 two weeks ago as the @entity24 rider moved to within seven points of @entity4 after his third triumph in the sixth of 18 races on the 2013 calendar			1

it was really difficult physically as it was the hottest race of the year			0

" because i was tough mentally and never gave up , i could open up a little gap in the last five laps that was enough to win			2

" i had to ride a defensive race for most of it as @entity18 was really attacking me , " @entity4 said			1
" it was not a perfect race for me as i was never close enough to @entity1 to pass him			2
it 's not a good feeling from this race but still i am relieved to be in the overall lead			0
" @entity18 , who started sixth on the grid , bounced back from his crash - ruined weekend at @entity39 as he claimed his fifth podium position this season to stay third in the championship -- 30 points behind @entity4			1
seven - time world champion @entity69 returned to form with fourth place , having failed to finish his home event in @entity22 after finishing 12th in @entity72 the previous race			1
" race by race , apart form the unlucky times especially like @entity39 , we grow up and i am able to ride the bike in a better way , " he said			0
" we still have some challenges , especially in the first part of the race where i still do n't have the right setting to push to the maximum			0
" @entity86 's @entity85 was fifth on a @entity19 ahead of @entity88 's @entity87 -- who achieved a career - best finish for @entity91 -- and @entity93 's @entity92			0
