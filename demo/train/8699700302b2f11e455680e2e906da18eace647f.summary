" " definition of ' is ' " every modern president has got one -- an inelegant statement , a broken promise , or an outright steaming lie , distilled to a three - second sound bite , that follows them into history			1
it can be part of a campaign slogan , a policy address or legal testimony			1
it can be delivered at a party convention , as part of a stump speech , from an aircraft carrier or during a deposition			1
it can be well - intentioned , misinformed , only untrue after the fact			1
and the facts can be entirely debatable			1
but there seems to be a lie or two that follows presidents into the history books			1
here is a look at some recent memorable ones : 1			1
' if you like your health insurance , you can keep it ' he 's got some time in office left , but @entity38 's signature gaffe line probably is going to be : " if you like your health insurance , you can keep it " it was a key line in selling the @entity40 , which narrowly passed back in 2010			1
but he has said it since then , too			2
what he said was true for most @entity44			2
they get their health insurance through their employer or the government with @entity49			1
but as open enrollment began this month for the fewer than 20 % of @entity44 @entity40 was designed to help , it became clear there is a subset of people who like their health plans and will in fact lose their health plans			1
these are the subset of @entity44 who buy their insurance individually and , because those plans do n't cover everything @entity40 now says must be covered , will have to get a new health care plan			1
related : the hidden truth behind early @entity40 numbers : it 's not what it seems granted , it might be a better health care plan			1
it might cover more services , like hospital stays , maternity , and mental health			1
but it also might be more expensive			2
@entity38 tweaked the promise after the fact during an appearance in @entity79 on wednesday			1
but it 's not exactly going to fit on a bumper sticker any more : " now , if you had one of these substandard plans before the @entity40 became law and you really liked that plan , you 're able to keep it , " @entity38 said this week			1
" that 's what i said when i was running for office			2
that was part of the promise we made			2
but ever since the law was passed , if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel these substandard plans , what we said under the law is you 've got to replace them with quality , comprehensive coverage -- because that , too , was a central premise of the @entity40 from the very beginning			2
" " and today , that promise means that every plan in the marketplace covers a core set of minimum benefits , like maternity care , and preventive care , and mental health care , and prescription drug benefits , and hospitalization , " @entity38 explained			1
" and they ca n't use allergies or pregnancy or a sports injury or the fact that you 're a woman to charge you more			2
they ca n't do that anymore			2
they ca n't do that anymore			2
no new taxes ' @entity127 's was the most devastating			2
" read my lips , " he declared at the @entity128			2
" no new taxes ! " it was a campaign pledge			2
and he broke it , big time			2
@entity127 did n't want to break the pledge , but in the face of a recession , and to avoid $ 100 billion in automatic , across - the - board spending cuts , he acquiesced and allowed a tax hike on the wealthy			1
it was disastrous for @entity127			0
it created a rift in the @entity141 and directly led to a spirited primary challenge two years later by @entity143			0
@entity127 ended up winning the primary , but losing re-election in a three - way race against @entity147 and @entity148			1
@entity149 @entity150 never said , " @entity149 , " but the banner placed behind him did when he landed on the deck of the @entity153 in a @entity155 jet and declared that " major combat operations in @entity157 have ended			1
in fact they were just getting started			0
and @entity127 would have to stake his legacy on a subsequent surge of @entity44 troops in @entity157			0
@entity127 won re-election in 2004 , but the war cost @entity44 a great deal in blood and treasure			0
fatigue with @entity157 contributed greatly to @entity141 ' losing control of @entity171 in 2006			0
' ... @entity172 recently sought significant quantities of uranium ... ' some presidents have more than one			1
the younger @entity127 will also be remembered for his decision to use public unity following the 9/11 attacks to mount a war in @entity157 , and the 16 words he used to justify the action			0
the case @entity127 made in his @entity184 helped lead the @entity44 into @entity157			0
he said , " the @entity186 government has learned that @entity172 recently sought significant quantities of uranium from @entity188			0
" it was n't true			0
but that did n't become clear until later after a high - profile scandal involving the leaking of @entity195 agent @entity194 's identity by vice president @entity197 's chief of staff			1
but the point of the 16 words , more importantly , is that the intelligence used to convince the country that combat operations were necessary to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction was inherently flawed			0
' brownie , you 're doing a heck of a job			0
' and not to pile on @entity127 ' 43 ' , but in the days just after @entity209 devastated the @entity210 and left much of @entity211 under water , the president came under intense heat for what was seen as a lackluster response by the federal government			1
on september 2 , 2005 , just three days after @entity209 destroyed the levees and flooded much of @entity211 ' @entity218 , @entity127 heaped unusual praise on then - @entity221 director @entity220 during a briefing at the @entity223			1
the soundbite , " @entity220 , you 're doing a heck of a job , " would haunt the president and go on to define a perception that @entity127 was out of touch during one of the worst tragedies in @entity44 history			0
' i did not have sexual relations with that woman , miss @entity235 ... ' @entity237 independent counsel @entity236 was n't originally appointed to investigate @entity147 's @entity239 sex life			0
but somehow that 's what it turned into			0
and without getting too far into the sordid details , the president found himself giving a videotaped deposition in a case regarding sexual harassment charges			0
the whole definition of sexual relations and the word " is " became a thing , the president faced impeachment and was nearly thrown out of office			0
he survived , but his legacy and his agenda were tarnished			0
and the list goes on			0
@entity257 had to admit he did n't know about the @entity258			0
@entity259 talked to the nation about a " crisis of confidence " and was panned for giving a " malaise " speech			0
and @entity266 's contention in a debate with @entity259 that " there is no @entity270 domination of @entity271 " made him look oblivious to the @entity270 's political and military control of the region			0
there are some rules that emerge			0
if the moment has to do with the economy and it occurs in the first term , there 's a good chance the president wo n't make it to a second term			0
if it has to do with foreign affairs , it might be just a blip on their legacy			0
the good news for @entity38 is that he 's been through his last election			1
the bad news is this demonstrably false new line has everything to do with his signature health law			1
as it carries on , how @entity44 react to the implementation of @entity40 could have real consequences on whether his successor is a president who wants to make the law better or gut it .			0

many presidents have uttered phrases they later regretted
@entity38 takes heat for saying that ' if you like your health insurance , you can keep it '
