-- forget the butterfly effect			2
in a globalized century , it 's a totally different effect you have to be worried about			2
@entity5 's new movie , " contagion , " is a star - powered thriller that hops from @entity9 to @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and beyond			1
each port of call brings another familiar face : @entity17 looking green and jet - lagged , @entity18 as her tired and bewildered husband , @entity20 coordinating the response for the @entity22 and @entity23 ( wonderful ) , who is first in the field as the @entity27 fatalities begin to mount			1
@entity28 is an @entity29 blogger who smells the story before anyone in the mainstream media			2
@entity33 is a @entity34 scientist collecting data from the initial carrier in @entity37			2
the @entity39 actress @entity38 is a revelation as another research scientist striving to find a cure			0
if this all sounds like an old - fashioned disaster movie , that 's not quite it			1
@entity5 is a great systems director			1
he 's fascinated with process , with mapping stuff out			0
think of the networks of crime and punishment in " traffic , " or the labyrinthine ingenuity of the " @entity55 's " capers			0
so , yes , this is a disaster movie on a massive scale , with a death toll exceeding 8 million before it 's even halfway done , but the emotional temperature remains cool and analytical			1
there 's certainly a shock factor when we see one famous star dissected on the autopsy table , but there 's not an awful lot of emotion here			0
in many ways this restraint is admirable			0
@entity5 and screenwriter @entity70 ( " the @entity71 ! " ) do their best to resist the urge to furnish each star turn with a potted melodrama			1
what the news guys used to call " human interest " flows from the inexorable progress of the epidemic and the imperfect and largely ineffectual systems the humans put in place to control it , not from whatever soap operas these folks have playing out in the private lives			0
though of course their professional actions are never entirely impersonal			0
heroes and villains do emerge			0
the former oftentimes buck the system and defy authority to protect their loved ones and assert their autonomy as best they can			0
interestingly enough , it 's the same with the villains			0
in the face of a catastrophic social breakdown , morality itself slides into a gray zone where the old rules no longer make sense			0
at the same time , the movie asks tricky questions about privilege and power that resonate well beyond the obvious echoes of swine flu and @entity112			1
@entity5 , who photographs his own movies under the pseudonym " @entity5 , " is a superb technician			1
for long stretches , " contagion " is a model of lucidity and clean , crisp storytelling			1
i could n't help thinking it 's too clean , too antiseptic even , to do full justice to such a grim worst - case scenario			1
we 're only a whisper away from a @entity128 zombie movie , after all , but in his rough and ready way , @entity128 would surely have given us something much bloodier , funnier and scarier , something that would hit us in the gut as hard as the brain			2
" contagion " is impressive on many levels and honestly depressing , too , but it never quite matches @entity128 's trick -- it never brings the dead to life .			2

the film ' contagion ' is chock - full of big - name actors
director @entity5 presents a disaster movie of epic *proportion*
*reviewer* says the movie is " a model of lucidity and clean , crisp storytelling "
