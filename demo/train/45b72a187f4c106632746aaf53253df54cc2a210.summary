-- i rarely get to experience fine dining			0
mostly because , generally speaking , it also requires fine currency			0
fortunately , i 'm perfectly happy with @entity6 , and enjoying one of those rarely requires dignity			0
even @entity10 shared my low - brow culinary interests			1
most people do n't know that			0
and you wo n't find it in any history books			0
seriously , i would n't look that up			0
all things considered , though , when i do get a chance to partake in a true quality meal at an upscale restaurant ( read : when someone else is buying ) i genuinely enjoy the odd experience of being served really small portions of elaborate food on really large elaborate plates , where 75 percent of the actual surface area is covered by tiny , elaborate flakes of garnish that , combined with the elaborate @entity31 © e , ultimately wo n't prevent me from just ordering pizza a few hours later when i get home so i can finally get to sleep all fat and bloated like i 'm accustomed to			1
still , while i 'm hardly deserving of such things , i really do enjoy the fine dining experience			0
and it 's partly because people leave their kids at home			1
recently , however , a couple did n't leave their kid at home , and that 's exactly what caused a heated online debate about the social acceptability of bringing your children to restaurants that do n't have crayons or dancing , human - sized mice that may or may not have done time in @entity58			1
" hey kids ! who wants to hear about the time i shanked a guy ! " this particular fine dining incident all started when the couple brought their 8 - month - old baby into one of @entity69 's swankiest restaurants , @entity70 , which has the incredibly rare distinction of being awarded three stars by a renowned tire company			1
meals at @entity70 start at $ 210			1
reservations are sold as tickets months in advance , and are non-refundable			0
so i 'm guessing they do n't serve fajitas			0
the head chef of @entity70 , @entity81 , later took to @entity82 after diners began complaining when the aforementioned 8 - month - old baby starting crying			1
as babies and columnists with crippling self - doubt sometimes do			1
@entity81 tweeted : @entity88 brings @entity89			1
@entity92 ppl no kids ? subject diners 2crying ? @entity95 take infants 2 plays ? concerts ? hate saying no , but			0
. it seems that the couple 's baby - sitter had canceled at the last moment , but they decided to go out for dinner anyway because , apparently , the family dog is n't a suitable or legal fill - in			1
" not surprisingly , @entity81 's tweet started a much larger conversation online where the general consensus was : screw your kids			1
now , before we go any deeper into this debate , let me first disclose that i do n't have any children of my own ... at least outside of those who may or may not be living in @entity117			0
and it 's not that i do n't like kids			2
they say the darndest things			0
it 's just that ... they 're also kind of sticky			2
quite frankly , i prefer the company of dogs			0
because , while i 'm quite grossed out by the idea of changing a diaper , i 'm somehow perfectly ok with wrapping my hand in a @entity132 bag and scooping up a giant , six - pound pile of partially digested @entity135 from my lawn			2
so , yes , i understand that i do n't understand what it 's like to have children			2
but i also understand what it 's like not to have children			2
whether this disqualifies me to comment on this subject is up for you to decide			0
regardless , we have to ask : should adults bring their small children to fine dining restaurants ? almost everyone i spoke to about this agrees with me that there 's a certain level of swank where you sort of have to draw the line			2
it 's a gray line			2
but it 's a line			2
and it runs nowhere near @entity162			0
the kids and restaurant debate later took a bizarre and wonderful twist when somebody created a fake @entity82 handle for the 8 - month - old child			1
@ @entity168 describes itself as ... a baby who likes fine food , fine drinks , and crying			1
but what should the no - kids criteria be ? is it a price range ? is it a particular style of cuisine ? or is it something undefined that you just sort of feel ? chef @entity81 eventually spoke about the incident on @entity187 's @entity186 where he simply said , " i could hear it crying in the kitchen			1
" and in response to the pop - up @entity82 account for @ @entity168 , he tweeted a photo of two giant fish heads and wrote : definitely not baby food ... and definitely not fajitas			1
i think we found our line			0
follow @ @entity200 on @entity82 .			1

a couple brought their 8 - month - old baby into @entity69 's *ultra-swanky* @entity70 restaurant
after the baby cried and *annoyed* other guests , chef @entity81 tweeted about it
a pop - up @entity82 account was created for the crying baby
