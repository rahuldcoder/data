-- raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens are swell and all , but boys and girls from around the world have vastly different interpretations of their " favorite things , " according to a new book by @entity13 photographer @entity12			1
@entity12 visited more than 50 countries to document children with their most prized playthings for " @entity17 : photos of @entity19 from @entity20 and their @entity21 , " which will be released on march 25			1
the photos prompt readers to reflect on the abundance of possessions that some children enjoy while others live a comparatively pared down existence because of poverty or their cultural values			2
" the fewer toys a child had , the less possessive he or she was about them , " notes @entity33 - based writer @entity32 in the book 's introduction			1
" @entity12 describes having to spend several hours winning the trust of @entity42 children before they would consent to let him touch their planes , cars , or dolls			1
' in poorer countries , they do n't care as much			1
they play in a different way , running around , sharing one ball between them all			0
' " not only are the toys reflective of the children 's socioeconomic class but also their parents ' aspirations			1
" hopes and ambitions are passed down through the toys parents choose for their children			1
children from families boasting musicians invariably receive toy instruments , " @entity32 writes , also noting that a cab driver 's son had a fleet of toy cars			0
@entity12 recently chatted with @entity0 via e-mail about " @entity72			1
" the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			0
@entity0 : where did you get the idea for the project ? @entity12 : i started this project almost by chance			1
the first photo i took of this series was in @entity85 ( @entity86 , the girl with the cows in the background )			0
she 's the daughter of one of my best friends ; that friend asked me to photograph her child			0
[ when ] i went to their house , and she was playing with the cows , i thought that situation was really nice and i decided to take the photo of her there with the cows and her toys			2
i really loved the result of that photo , and some months later when i was starting my trip around the world , i decided to take the same kind of photo in every country that i was going to visit			2
i had the opportunity to travel around the world for more than two years because , at that time , i was working for one of the major @entity13 magazines " @entity114			2
" i was doing a project about @entity116 , so i traveled to 58 countries by only using the network			1
all the children that i have photographed are somehow connected to the couch surfers that hosted me along my long trip			0
they are their children , their nieces and nephews or simply their neighbors			0
@entity127 ' teddy bears @entity0 : these toys are obviously prized possessions to the boys and girls -- how did you earn the children 's trust ? @entity12 : i played with them ! and , of course , with the help of their parents			1
most of the time , it was really easy to get their trust			0
i always had the photos of the children i photographed before , so sometimes it was just enough to show them the other photos to convince them to pose for me			0
i was really surprised to see how easy it was for children to understand my project			2
@entity0 photos : clown ' revolution ' lifts refugee kids @entity0 : what did you want the project 's takeaway to be ? @entity12 : i do n't want to give any particular message			1
i just wanted to show how different we are in the world , and how different people live all around the globe			2
@entity0 : did any particular photo shoots stick out ? @entity12 : every child and photo has their own funny anecdote , but one of the most particular is the one i photographed in @entity171 : @entity172 , the girl with the sunglasses			1
i was in this little village in the north part of the country , a place where there is almost nothing -- no electricity , no running water and , of course , no toy stores			0
it is almost impossible to find a child with a toy			0
almost all of the children play outside with each other , and they are used to playing with anything they find outside			0
i was lucky enough to arrive in that village a couple of days after @entity172 found a box of sunglasses on the ground along the main road			0
her mother told me she thought they had fallen off a truck , but all the children in the village were playing with these glasses			0
@entity0 : did you have a favorite toy growing up that you would have been photographed with if the shoe was on the other foot ? @entity12 : yes , from ages 3 to 6 , i had a little [ plush ] monkey that i called @entity209			1
that was for sure my favorite one !			2

photographer @entity12 visited more than 50 countries for the project
the book will be released on march 25 by *publisher* @entity221
