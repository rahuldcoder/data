@entity0 -- the widening phone - hacking scandal that brought down one of @entity5 's biggest newspapers claimed two more casualties sunday as authorities arrested the paper 's former editor , @entity8 , and @entity0 's police chief announced plans to resign			1
" as commissioner , i carry ultimately responsibility for the position we find ourselves in			1
with hindsight , i wish we had juggled some matters involved in this affair differently			1
i did n't and that 's it , " metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity20 told reporters			1
his announcement came hours after authorities arrested former @entity28 editor @entity27 in connection with @entity5 police investigations into phone hacking and police bribery , her spokesman said			1
@entity27 was released around midnight , but it remained unclear whether she would testify as scheduled tuesday at a @entity36 hearing on the scandal			1
@entity20 stressed sunday that he had behaved ethically , but said he decided to resign because increased scrutiny connected to the case would burden his department and detract from its accomplishments			1
" i have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the @entity44 's links with @entity51 at a senior level , " said @entity20 , who became commissioner in 2009 of the @entity44 , which also is known as @entity45			1
@entity20 's announcement came a day before @entity5 home secretary @entity54 is scheduled to make a statement to @entity5 lawmakers about relations between the @entity44 and a former executive editor of the @entity28 who was arrested last week in connection with the phone - hacking scandal			1
the former editor , @entity61 , became a communications consultant to the @entity44 after leaving the paper			1
on sunday , @entity20 denied accusations that the department suspected @entity61 ' involvement in phone - hacking when they hired him as a consultant			1
" i had no knowledge of the extent of this disgraceful practice and the repugnant nature of the selection of victims that is now emerging , nor of its apparent reach into senior levels , " @entity20 said			2
" i saw senior figures from @entity51 providing evidence that the misbehavior was confined to a rogue few and not known about at the top			2
" the @entity45 chief also denied that his free stay at an expensive spa earlier this year had anything to do with @entity61 ' connection with the resort , @entity89			1
in a statement earlier sunday , the @entity44 said @entity20 's stay was arranged by the resort 's managing director , who is a personal family friend			2
" there has been no impropriety and i am extremely happy with what i did and the reasons for it			2
... the attempt to represent this in a negative way is both cynical and disappointing , " @entity20 said			2
@entity5 prime minister @entity102 issued a statement sunday praising @entity20 for his " long and distinguished career			2
" " while i know that today must be a very sad occasion for him , i respect and understand his decision to leave the @entity44 , and i wish him well for the future , " he said			2
he added that @entity44 investigators must " do everything possible to ensure the investigations into phone hacking and alleged police corruption proceed with all speed , with full public confidence and with all the necessary leadership and resources to bring them to an effective conclusion			1
" earlier sunday , authorities arrested @entity27			2
she was being quizzed by police in @entity0 after having come in by appointment , a @entity44 spokesman said			1
@entity27 did not know she was going to be arrested when she arrived , her spokesman @entity124 said			1
the police agency does not release names of suspects arrested and police officials referred @entity1 to a statement describing an unnamed 43 - year - old woman 's release when asked whether @entity27 remained in custody			1
@entity27 ' spokesman told @entity1 she was released shortly before midnight and was at home early monday morning			1
@entity45 said the woman was released on bail and is scheduled to return to a @entity0 police station in october			1
@entity27 resigned on friday as chief executive of @entity139 's @entity51 , which published the @entity28			1
the company also did not know she was about to be arrested when it accepted her resignation , a @entity51 source told @entity1 sunday , asking not to be named discussing internal corporate affairs			2
it was not clear how her arrest will affect the hearing tuesday in the @entity36			2
committee member @entity148 , a @entity149 member of @entity150 , said the committee chair was " taking legal advice " on the situation			2
@entity124 said that over the next 24 to 36 hours @entity27 ' attorneys will be in discussion with the select committee to see whether her appearance at the hearing is still appropriate			2
@entity159 , a prominent @entity5 media lawyer , told @entity1 the arrest was " somewhat theatrical , " given that @entity27 has apparently not been charged with a crime			2
@entity27 had asked police since january whether they wanted to speak with her , but was told that was not needed , @entity124 said			1
while she received a call friday to come in sunday and answer questions , she was not told she would be arrested on arrival , @entity124 said , adding that it came as a shock to @entity27			2
@entity27 is adamant that she is innocent of any wrongdoing , @entity124 said			2
@entity27 is the eighth person arrested in connection with the phone - hacking probe and the fourth arrested in the bribery investigation , police said sunday			1
two people , including @entity27 , have been detained over both probes , meaning a total of 10 people have been arrested			0
@entity51 said sunday before the arrest that it would " not tolerate wrongdoing " and was determined to rebuild its reputation			0
@entity51 said it would compensate those affected by its illegal phone hacking , cooperate fully with the police and had hired a law firm to " examine past failings " and recommend new procedures to make sure they are not repeated			1
the promise comes in national newspaper advertisements in all the major sunday @entity5 newspapers -- a group that this week does not include the @entity28 for the first time in 168 years			0
@entity139 closed the paper last week , less than a week after it came out that reporters working for him had illegally eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl , @entity201 , and deleted some of her messages to make room for more			0
she was later found dead			0
closing the paper has not put an end to the scandal , which has exposed the close links the @entity5 press has with both politicians and the police			1
media baron @entity139 apologized to the @entity5 public with full - page advertisements in seven national newspapers saturday			0
" we are sorry , " says saturday 's ad , which was signed by @entity139			0
he did not sign sunday 's ad			0
" the @entity28 was in the business of holding others to account			0
it failed when it came to itself			0
we are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred			0
we are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected			0
" @entity139 's apology comes after his media empire lost two top executives friday			0
@entity27 on friday resigned from her post as chief executive at @entity51 , the @entity5 arm of @entity139 's @entity232 hours later , her predecessor , @entity233 resigned			1
@entity139 also visited @entity201 's family on friday			0
police in the @entity5 have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking in documents recovered from a private investigator working for the paper			1
there were also allegations that @entity232 reporters may have bribed police officers			1
@entity139 's campaign of contrition started 12 days after the scandal first broke and barely a week after the @entity28 , @entity5 's best - selling sunday tabloid , was shut down by @entity51 in the face of public outrage			0
@entity139 , his son , @entity250 , and @entity27 are to appear before @entity5 politicians tuesday to answer questions over the phone hacking scandal			0
some of the claims @entity27 faces relate to the @entity28 's alleged hacking , while she was editor , into @entity258 's mobile phone account			0
she has warned that her answers may be limited by ongoing police and judicial inquiries			1
" as chief executive of the company , i feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt , and i want to reiterate how sorry i am for what we now know to have taken place , " she said in a statement friday			1
@entity233 , who most recently served as chief executive of @entity273 , publisher of @entity275 , wrote to @entity139 to say that although he had been unaware of alleged misconduct when he was executive chairman of @entity51 , which operated the now - defunct @entity28 , he had to take responsibility			1
" the pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable , " he said in a letter provided by @entity273			0
@entity102 has been among those publicly decrying the hacking , blasting @entity139 's company wednesday as he launched a high - powered judge - led investigation into the nation 's press			0
yet he has his own ties to the scandal , given his relationship with @entity291			0
@entity291 resigned as @entity28 editor in 2007 after his former royal editor and a private detective were convicted of conspiracy to hack into royals ' voice mails			0
but while offering his resignation , he insisted he had been unaware of the crimes and he was not charged at the time			0
after last year 's election , @entity102 became prime minister -- and appointed @entity291 as his communications director			0
@entity291 resigned as @entity102 's spokesman in january when the scandal blew up afresh			1
@entity102 hosted @entity291 overnight in march at @entity305 , the prime minister 's country estate , a @entity309 source said friday			0
the aim of the invite , added the source , was to thank his former communications director for his work on @entity102 's behalf			0
earlier this month , @entity291 was arrested in connection with claims of phone hacking and corruption dating to his days as the @entity28 editor			0
after the arrest , the prime minister took full responsibility for hiring @entity291			0
but while not denying this personal connection , @entity102 has maintained public pressure against @entity232 meanwhile , the @entity326 is also investigating @entity232 after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of september 11 survivors , victims and their families			0
@entity139 's @entity232 encompasses @entity335 , @entity275 , the @entity336 and @entity338 publishers in the @entity339			0
@entity51 -- a @entity5 subsidiary of @entity232 -- owns the @entity340 , @entity341 and the @entity342 in @entity5			0
@entity1 's @entity343 , @entity344 , @entity345 and @entity346 contributed to this report .			0
