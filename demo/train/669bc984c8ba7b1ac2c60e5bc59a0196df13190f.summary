a memorial cross at the @entity2 in @entity3 can remain at the newly - opened facility , an appeals court ruled monday			1
a three - judge panel of the 2nd @entity6 found that the cross , located at ground zero , was " a symbol of hope " and historical in nature			1
it did not intentionally discriminate against a group of atheists who sued to have it removed , they ruled			2
@entity18 moved to @entity20 site the court also rejected arguments the traditional @entity24 cross was an impermissible mingling of church and state			1
" with this recognition , a reasonable observer would view the primary effect of displaying the cross at ground zero , amid hundreds of other ( mostly secular ) artifacts , to be ensuring historical completeness , not promoting religion , " the judges said in their decision			0
the 17 - foot cross in the museum was erected by rescue and recovery workers , and built from intersecting steel beams that had been part of the @entity20 's @entity44 , after it collapsed during the @entity47 terror attacks in 2001			2
@entity48 it was moved a year ago from near a church to its new location in lower @entity52			0

the case was first dismissed by a federal district judge			0
