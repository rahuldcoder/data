-- @entity1 this week created a new feature that allows readers of that online encyclopedia to create their own e-books with its content			1
the " epub export feature " makes it easier for people to read free encyclopedia articles on their mobile phones , e-readers or tablets when they do n't have a connection , @entity1 said in a blog post on monday			1
" epub files can be used very easily in an offline environment , " @entity17 , mobile director at the @entity18 , said in a written statement			2
" they can be opened and distributed just like normal files			0
plus , there are readers for almost every platform			0
" to make your own book , sign up on the site 's book creator page			2
once you do , a green button will appear at the top of @entity1 pages asking you if you want to " add this page to your book			1
" more than one encyclopedia article can be added to a single e-book			1
the blog @entity38 points out that this idea may seem bizarre at first			0
but writer @entity41 says the feature has potential			0
" personally , i would love to be able to access @entity1 while on the subway , and this new addition is a decent way to do that , assuming i know what i want to read in advance , " the blogger wrote			2
" in countries where internet access is still very rare , not to mention mobile devices are the only devices , this wo n't be seen just as a feature of @entity1			1
" the e-books can be distributed after users create them			0
" collections can be exported in a variety of formats like @entity62 , @entity63 , or @entity64 , " @entity1 says			0
" you can also order a printed book via @entity67 , the official print - on - demand partner of @entity1			1
