-- the @entity2 is preparing to ban caffeinated alcohol drinks , sen. @entity1 said tuesday			1
in response , one leading manufacturer of these drinks announced that it will remove caffiene and other ingredients from its product			2
the @entity2 , which has been reviewing the drinks since last year , declined to comment on the report			1
spokeswoman @entity12 said the matter was still under review			0
but @entity1 , in a statement issued to the media , said the @entity2 will rule that caffeine is an unsafe additive to alcoholic beverages , effectively banning them from the @entity21 market			1
" let these rulings serve as a warning to anyone who tried to peddle dangerous and toxic brews to our children			0
do it and we will shut you down , " @entity1 , @entity29 - @entity28 , said in the statement			1
critics say such drinks -- leading brands include @entity36 and @entity37 -- mix as much as three cups of coffee with three cans of beer and are designed to appeal to younger consumers accustomed to consuming high - caffeine energy drinks			1
a 23.5 - ounce can of @entity36 contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume , depending on state regulations			2
what 's inside alcoholic energy drinks ? the combination of caffeine and alcohol -- which also is found in drinks like rum and cola -- allows drinkers to consume alcohol for a longer period of time without headaches , dry mouth or other unpleasant side effects , according to @entity63 , an associate professor of pharmacy at @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66			1
@entity1 's office said a recent study found that young drinkers who combine alcohol and caffeine are more likely to be injured , sexually assaulted , drive while drinking and require medical attention than those who drink caffeinate - free drinks			1
in the latest news , several @entity76 state college students became ill in october after drinking @entity36			2
@entity78 , the manufacturer of @entity36 , announced tuesday that it intends to reformulate its drinks to remove caffeine , guarana and taurine from them			0
from now on , there will only be noncaffeinated versions of @entity36			0
" we have repeatedly contended -- and still believe , as do many people throughout the country -- that the combination of alcohol and caffeine is safe			0
if it were unsafe , popular drinks like rum and colas or @entity98 coffees that have been consumed safely and responsibly for years would face the same scrutiny that our products have recently faced , " the company 's co-founders said in a statement			2
the company also noted that the @entity103 had approved their products			0
" we are taking this step after trying -- unsuccessfully -- to navigate a difficult and politically - charged regulatory environment at both the state and federal levels , " the statement said			0
@entity78 said that over the last several months they wanted to talk with regulators and policymakers in hopes of coming up with standards regulating caffeinated alcoholic beverages			0
" by taking this action today , we are again demonstrating leadership , cooperation and responsible corporate citizenship , " the statement said			0
if the @entity2 does move to ban the drinks , it would join @entity28 , @entity76 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 in ejecting the products from store shelves .			1
