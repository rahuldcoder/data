-- when the @entity2 season began , not many would have picked @entity3 to win the individual title			1
he was a rookie making the transition from @entity6 and replacing one of the sport 's greats , @entity7 , at @entity10			0
he also had to contend with reigning world champion @entity11 and perennial contender @entity12			1
according to @entity15 oddsmaker @entity13 , @entity3 was merely the joint third favorite at 7/2 , behind @entity11 and @entity12 and tied with motorcycling legend @entity17			1
but @entity3 's brash style -- along with shoulder injuries to @entity11 and @entity12 -- saw the @entity21 move into contention and it appears nothing can stop the 20 - year - old from becoming the first rookie to claim the @entity2 crown in 35 years			1
his odds of winning the title now stand at a miniscule 1/9			0
" there are no excuses , " @entity11 said			2
" @entity3 was faster than us and he was better			0
i can only congratulate him and look forward to the next race			0
" @entity11 was speaking to reporters sunday , after @entity3 captured @entity36 's @entity35 -- but they were words he could have uttered for much of the campaign			1
@entity3 chased down @entity39 's @entity11 -- it was n't the first time this season that happened -- before easing to the finish line			1
it ended @entity11 's two - race winning streak and boosted @entity3 's overall advantage to a substantial 39 points with only four races remaining			1
" i did n't expect this before the start of the season , " @entity3 was quoted as saying by @entity51 news agency @entity50 this month			2
" my goal was just to take some podiums and try to fight for some victories in the end of the season			0
" at the moment i want to go race by race but for sure we have some possibility ( to win the crown )			0
" we do n't have any pressure because we have already done better than what we expected			0
" @entity12 probably was n't all that impressed with @entity3 , his teammate , on sunday			1
they touched on lap 6 as @entity3 seemed to out - brake himself and @entity12 crashed seconds later , hurting his hip and groin			1
" @entity3 went in too wide on the corner entry , clipped me from the outside and i went flying when i got on the gas , " @entity12 told the team website			2
" my mechanics told me later that the traction - control cable had been cut by the contact			0
" the team told me i caused his traction - control cable to snap and i 'm sorry for that , " @entity3 told the team website			0
" it 's something very unusual to see			0
" but seeing @entity3 atop the standings has become commonplace .			2

with four races remaining , @entity3 leads the @entity2 standings by 39 points
@entity3 won the @entity35 on sunday after catching @entity11
@entity3 and teammate @entity12 made contact and @entity12 later crashed
the next three races are in @entity94 , @entity51 and @entity95 before the @entity97 finale
