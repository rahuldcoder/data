-- it took a lot of effort for @entity4 to turn his amputated leg into a fully functional lamp			1
for starters , he had to break the damn thing in a freak kiddie pool accident			1
that 's how it all started , thus confirming what i 've always said : " @entity16 pools are not toys , and should only be used as giant , outdoor toilets			2
" i chose that as my high school yearbook quote over " carpe diem			2
" but it really happened			2
in july 2012 , the unfortunate @entity24 suffered a terrible break while goofing off with his cousin in south @entity27			1
over time , the leg became infected , ignored , and more infected to the point where , in july of this year , doctors had to remove it surgically			1
so , @entity4 , now 53 , settled in to the fact that he would be losing his right leg -- a harsh reality for an otherwise healthy and active man			1
but it was damaged beyond repair , and there was nothing he could do			2
except , you know , maybe ask to keep it			2
" it 's my leg , " he told me over the phone			1
" it 's my legal right			2
we 'll get to that			2
either way , he asked for it , which i 'm sure lead to a rather awkward , if not spirited , conversation with hospital administrators			2
" sir , we just ca n't give it to you			0
well , what if i bring in my own tin foil ? " generally speaking , hospitals use very specific protocol with amputations			0
for safety and sanitation reasons , they 're usually required to incinerate them			0
body parts can also be buried during some sort of official funeral ( and , perhaps , exhumed ) with proper legal oversight			0
but that was an expensive option , and not one @entity4 was able to afford			1
@entity72 , probably worth it just to see the face of the grave digger			0
" do n't go anywhere , @entity76			0
and hold on to that shovel			0
" so , @entity4 would n't be doing that			1
there would be no funeral			0
still , he wanted his leg , for he had a crazy idea			1
he would turn it into a lamp			1
sort of like the one from @entity86 's house in " @entity87			0
thus , @entity4 and the hospital entered a complicated period of legal negotiations , where they finally came to a mutual agreement after a strange set of circumstances			1
you see , leading up to his surgery at @entity97 , a news reporter gave @entity4 a book by @entity100 about a mysterious leg found by a fisherman in the @entity103			1
that book led @entity104 to a pathologist named @entity106 , who was more than happy to help with all this lamp nonsense			1
you see , as per his profession , @entity106 was able to legally obtain @entity4 's leg from the hospital after surgery			1
thus , the leg was then couriered to @entity106 as specified by the law			1
and , ultimately , he would preserve the leg with chemicals so it could remain ... a leg			2
someone still had to make it into a lamp			2
eventually , as @entity4 's story became an even bigger media sensation , a designer named @entity127 decided to reach out and offer his services to complete the vision			1
this thing was actually going to happen			0
and now it 's done			0
they made a lamp out of his leg			1
today , the leg sits suspended in a glass cylinder filled with a solution			2
surrounding that cylinder are metal bars , symbolizing two years of physical " imprisonment " suffered by @entity4 while the leg deteriorated			1
above that is an empty space			0
this represents the rehab period			0
and on the top sits a large remote - controlled led light , flanked by two metal wings , honoring @entity4 's upcoming freedom from the help of a new limb			1
which is where the story takes another twist			0
the issue of the prosthetic			0
@entity4 explained to me that the one he 's getting through his insurance is not top of the line			1
quite simply , he wants something better			0
because , before all this , he played soccer			0
it was one silly accident that changed everything			2
but a high - tech prosthetic will cost him			0
so , he decided to sell his lamp on @entity171 for â ‚ ¬ 100,000 -- an endeavor that lasted not even two days before the online bidding site rejected his listing			1
you ca n't sell human parts on @entity171			1
on the plus side , you can sell used socks			0
do n't ask me why i was looking			0
just know that you can			0
so , until somebody comes to him with an offer , @entity4 will just keep it at home , where he just returned after a lengthy stint in rehab			1
his lamp will arrive on sunday , and he 'll finally be re-united with his leg			1
" my leg is amputated , " he says , fully understanding the humor and absurdity in all this			1
" but it gives me a good feeling that i still have it			0
" and if he wants to cover the foot with a dirty , used sock ... sadly , i know just the place			0
follow @ @entity198 on @entity199			0
and prepare to be underwhelmed			0
