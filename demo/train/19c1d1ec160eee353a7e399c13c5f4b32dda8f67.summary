-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 signed into law sunday a bill that prevents local governments from banning the practice of male circumcision			1
the legislation comes in response to an effort this summer by a @entity12 advocacy group opposed to the practice to get a measure proposing a citywide ban added to the november 8 city ballot			2
in july , a @entity18 judge ordered the proposed measure removed from the ballot , saying that male circumcision is " a widely practiced medical procedure " and that medical services are left to the regulation of the state , not individual cities			0
the legislation signed sunday , which takes effect immediately , prohibits governments at the local or county level from " restricting the practice of male circumcision " and " declares that the laws affecting male circumcision must have uniform application throughout the state			0

the law prevents local governments from *enforcing* such a ban
a @entity12 group tried in july to get a citywide ban added to the november ballot
