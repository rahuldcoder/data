-- he never told a lie , as the story goes			0
so maybe if he were alive today , president @entity4 could tell a @entity6 library what he did with two books he checked out 221 years ago			1
the two books -- weighty discourses on international relations and parliamentary debates -- were checked out on october 5 , 1789			1
they were due on november 2 , 1789 , but were n't brought back			0
since then , they 've been steadily collecting a fine of a few cents each day , adding up to more than $ 4,000 by the @entity17 's informal estimate			1
" i 'm sorry , math is not my thing at all , " said @entity18 , the assistant head librarian when asked to hazard a guess			0
the fine at the time was 2 pence a day			2
now , it 's 15 cents -- " it 's really gone up , has n't it ? " she quipped			0
one of the librarians , @entity28 , guessed the fine to be in the region of 3,000 @entity31 pounds , or about $ 4,577			2
" he stuck with the pence concept , " @entity18 said			0
the library first learned of the missing books when it discovered a yellowed ledger in its basement it listed all the people who had checked out books from the city 's oldest library between july 1789 and april 1792			1
next to the works " @entity42 " and the 12th volume of " @entity44 " was the name of the person who checked them out : " president			0
" at the time , @entity6 was the capital of the @entity49 , and the library was the only one in town			1
soon after , the capital was relocated to @entity53 and then @entity54 the @entity6 library , a subscription library that was @entity6 's first library open to the public , has known about the missing books since the 1930s			1
the matter came up again recently because the library is capturing the ledgers in digital form to preserve the records			2
library officials cross-checked the books mentioned in the ledger with the ones in their collection			1
" @entity70 ( of " @entity44 " ) was still missing , " as was the other book , @entity18 said			2
the library is not so concerned about the fine as it is about each book			1
" we do n't know where it is , " she said			0
" we have tried to find it and we ca n't , " she said .			0
