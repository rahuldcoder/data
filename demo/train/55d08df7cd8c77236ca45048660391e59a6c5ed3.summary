@entity0 , @entity1 -- preliminary dna tests indicate a 3 - year - old foster child is the son of a woman being held captive by leftist rebels , @entity1 officials announced friday			1
@entity8 appears in a video released by the kidnappers in july 2002			0
" there is a very high probability that @entity16 belongs to the family of @entity18 , " @entity11 , the country 's chief federal prosecutor , said at a news conference			0
the boy , known as " @entity20 , " has been at the center of a hostage drama that raised hopes the @entity24 would liberate some of their hostages			2
the rebel group , known as @entity24 for its @entity28 acronym , had agreed to release three hostages as part of a deal brokered by @entity33 president @entity32			1
@entity24 said it would release @entity20 along with his mother , @entity8 , and another woman , @entity36 , but the mission to free the captives fell apart december 31 , when the rebel group said it could not release the hostages because of @entity1 military operations in the area , according to a @entity24 statement @entity32 read on @entity33 television			1
@entity1 president @entity45 denied the group 's assertion , saying there were no combat operations in the area near the rebels , and he said the rebels could not release the three hostages because they did not have @entity20 in custody			2
he raised the possibility that @entity20 , who was born in captivity to @entity18 , was living in a foster home in the @entity1 capital of @entity0			1
authorities in @entity1 suspect the @entity24 duped child - welfare authorities by presenting the boy as a child in need of foster care in 2005 , he said			1
on friday , @entity11 said initial dna results will be checked against tests being done in @entity67 labs to verify the child 's identity			0
there was no immediate response from @entity33 after the announcement concerning @entity20 's @entity73			0
however , a statement on the @entity33 government 's web site from earlier friday said the @entity1 government had not allowed @entity33 to participate in the dna testing			1
established in 1964 as the military wing of the @entity80 , @entity24 is @entity1 's oldest , largest , most capable and best - equipped @entity81 rebel group , according to the @entity83 @entity82			1
the @entity83 , the @entity84 and @entity1 classify it as a terrorist group			2
@entity24 has justified hostage - taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long - running and complex civil war that also has involved right - wing paramilitary units , government forces and drug traffickers			0
fighting has waned , but not stopped , in recent years			0
among the group 's hostages are three @entity83 contractors who were captured when their plane went down in 2003 during a drug - eradication flight , and @entity98 , a @entity99 - @entity1 independent presidential candidate who was kidnapped in 2002			2
@entity18 was kidnapped in 2002 while she managed @entity98 's campaign			0
@entity98 is perhaps the best - known captive in @entity1 , a country plagued by kidnapping			0
