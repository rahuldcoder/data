the @entity1 establishment won big during this year 's midterm elections , fending off far - right candidates in primary races who might have threatened the party 's bid to retake full control of @entity9			1
@entity1 leaders will have to keep an eye on a wide - open presidential primary , along with internal party fights at the @entity15 , @entity16 and gubernatorial levels			1
that could spread the party thin and leave an opening for conservative activists to pluck off establishment leaders with greater ease , particularly in congressional races as much of the attention shifts to the battle for the @entity15			1
conservatives , smarting from their losses this cycle , are already getting organized for 2016			1
and they came out of this month 's government spending fight furious that congressional @entity1 produced no tangible response to president @entity33 's immigration executive action and convinced that @entity1 are still ceding issues to @entity35 after the election			1
@entity37 , a conservative strategist and editor of the site @entity40 , said that now that @entity1 have control of @entity9 , " there 's nowhere to run , and nowhere to hide " for those who have n't kept their promises to the @entity1 base			1
" you can only fool most of the people some of the time , " he said			0
" every capitulation [ congressional @entity1 ] engage in , every primary they win by getting across the finish line and they do n't do what they 've promised — it becomes that much tougher for them to defend			1
" @entity53 , the former @entity1 @entity16 majority leader , said party leaders need to acknowledge the challenge they 'll face with the presidential race at the top of the ticket			0
" you have to go into it realizing what 's going on in the @entity1 presidential primaries will have some effect on the @entity15 and @entity16 primaries , " @entity53 said in an interview			2
" what they need to do — that they did well in 2014 , but they need to do even better this cycle — is reduce the number of open seats , and recruit solid contenders			1
" the dynamic underscores the competing priorities among @entity1 heading into 2016			0
establishment leaders view moderate candidates like @entity78 or @entity79 as their best shot at winning the presidency			1
but conservatives believe that type of candidate would only follow in @entity86 's path to a disappointing loss , and are pushing for bomb - throwers like sens. @entity89 or @entity90			2
the debate will play out at a time when republicans are vulnerable on @entity94			0
though they will hold majorities in both chambers , @entity1 face a daunting map in the @entity16 , where they 'll defend 24 seats in 2016 -- seven in states that @entity33 won twice			0
establishment @entity1 see a need for more centrist nominees to defend those states in particular , and yet those centrist incumbents — senators like @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107 — already have targets on their backs			2
@entity110 , spokesman for the establishment - friendly outside group @entity111 , said nominating strong candidates takes on added urgency because of the tough political terrain for @entity1			2
" i think [ candidate quality ] is very important , especially given the fact that we have the @entity16 and we 'll want to make sure that we maintain it — and we have a map with a lot of @entity1 senators who are up for reelection in purple or blue states that @entity33 won , " he said			0
the memory of @entity126 , the @entity127 @entity1 @entity16 candidate who created headaches for candidates up and down the ballot with his comments on rape and pregnancy in 2012 — and lost a winnable race — has n't faded from the minds of @entity1 strategists			2
they are wary that another fringe nominee could undermine the party 's shot at the @entity15 this year			1
building on lessons from that cycle and 2010 , national @entity1 this year decided to aggressively engage in primary fights to help nominate strong candidates , and the strategy brought the @entity1 great success			1
but their primary successes took huge amounts of resources from the establishment , both financial and human , and considerable message discipline across the @entity1			1
along with the @entity155 , the @entity154 and @entity111 all poured millions into primaries to defend incumbents and beat back conservative challengers			0
establishment strategists that engaged in primary fights this past cycle acknowledged with a wide - open , high - stakes presidential primary splitting attention and resources away from @entity15 and @entity16 primaries , conditions are ripe for an underfunded , insurgent challenger to slip through to the general			1
@entity169 , an adviser to a @entity171 - based super pac that helped sen. @entity172 fend off an unexpectedly tough challenge from the right , said incumbents this cycle should see @entity172 's race as a cautionary tale			1
fundraising " has to be a concern , " he said			0
" you have to raise a ton of money and make sure you have a strong political organization in your state , " he said			0
" they 're all going to require human capital , as well as financial capital , to win those races " in 2016			0
@entity1 strategist @entity190 , who advised the @entity155 last cycle and was sent to help @entity193 sen. @entity192 overcome an unexpectedly strong independent challenger , said on that front in particular , the presidential primary could make things tougher			1
" there 's gon na be a lot of competition for money , a money and time - suck is going to really have an impact on @entity16 and @entity15 candidates , especially challengers , " he said			2
indeed , @entity205 said the group again plans to engage heavily in primaries			0
but he acknowledged it will be tougher to raise the money			0
and there 's also the prospect that typically fringe candidates wo n't need the money to pick up traction , with a conservative presidential candidate offering them some lift			2
that could also complicate the party 's message downballot , if incumbents and establishment candidates are asked to answer for gaffes or controversial comments made by conservative candidates engaged in the presidential primaries			1
and having a conservative - vs. - establishment fight at the presidential level could force some downballot candidates to address some of the more policy issues they can typically skirt , like welfare reform or disaster relief , that could be problematic for a nominee in a general election			2
@entity37 said conservatives see that as a key advantage of the upcoming cycle			2
" we do have a net benefit of a presidential election , where you have prominent people at the top of the ticket discussing those issues and forcing some of those individual candidates downballot to go on the record , " he said			0
but @entity249 , a veteran @entity1 strategist with close ties to establishment groups and candidates , said that could be the @entity1 's " biggest challenge			1
" " our biggest concern is making sure that @entity1 and candidates are running their statewide programs — and not falling into the challenges of the presidential primary campaign trail , " he said			0
preparing for that potential is already underway			0
incoming senate majority leader @entity261 is in talks to launch a new super pac geared towards @entity16 races , likely to bolster the @entity155 and @entity111 in helping nominate strong candidates and engage in the general election fight			0
the @entity155 has met with the chiefs of staff of all incumbent senators up for reelection			0
but @entity272 groups say they 're recalibrating as well , preparing for what @entity273 president @entity273 called " real combat			1
" " it 's going to be real combat between the moderates and the conservatives in the party — it 's going to come to the surface in a pretty dramatic way , " he said .			0

the @entity272 lost nearly every one of its battles in 2014 , but may have a better shot this cycle
with three levels of primary fights , the establishment 's attention and resources will be split
establishment groups are already gearing up for another *costly* and *divisive* battle
