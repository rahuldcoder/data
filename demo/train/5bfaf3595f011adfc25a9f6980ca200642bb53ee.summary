-- authorities have launched an investigation into how dispatchers handled 911 calls from those seeking help before , they say , @entity7 killed his sons and himself in his @entity11 home			1
critics have said it took too long for dispatchers to grasp the danger of the situation and alert police			1
" we will investigate all aspects of this incident , and if there is a need to refine our processes , ( as we do continually ) we will do so , " said @entity18 , director of the @entity19 , which operates the 911 call center			1
" if there is a need to investigate from a disciplinary perspective and assign individual responsibility , we will do that as well			1
" call center records show that it took eight minutes for the dispatcher to send a police car , and it took an additional 13 minutes for a police car to get to @entity7 's home , @entity0 affiliate @entity31 reported			1
@entity18 's comments come as the community come to grips with sunday 's murder - suicide at @entity42 , @entity11 home			1
@entity7 is accused of snatching his young sons from a social worker who was delivering them for a supervised visit , locking the door , hacking the kids with a hatchet and starting an explosive fire in the home			1
tapes of 911 conversations , released this week , detail the frantic social worker trying to get help			2
after tragedy , @entity56 reflects on the difficult job of the social worker but even after she told a dispatcher that she smelled gasoline and @entity7 would not let her in the home , a dispatcher continued to ask questions about her job and says " life - threatening situations come first			1
" " this could be life - threatening , " the social worker pleads			2
" he was in court on wednesday and he did n't get his kids back and this is really ... @entity69 afraid for their lives			2
" the social worker 's husband said she was badly shaken up			2
" she 's very upset and traumatized			2
she has said that she thinks this is something that is going to be a life - changing event , " the husband told @entity31			2
there has been some criticism of the @entity80 's responses to the social worker			0
@entity82 , spokesman for the @entity83 , said he wished the operator 's " etiquette " would have been different , but information gathering on such calls can take time			0
" we try to get it right every single time			0
with humans here sometimes , there are mistakes made			0
i can`t tell you whether that was the case here until the investigation is complete , " @entity18 told the affiliate			0
services for @entity100 , 7 , and @entity101 , 5 , will be held saturday			2
family members said they were having a hard time dealing with their grief			0
" how could you do that to your children ? " their grandfather , @entity105 , told @entity110 's @entity109 on wednesday night			0
@entity105 said the social worker should not have been taking the boys to @entity7 's residence alone			1
" i 'm glad she is safe , " he said			0
" she could very well have been in that house			0
he could have closed the door behind her			0
" @entity7 was embroiled in an ugly custody dispute with the @entity119 that stems back to the 2009 disappearance of his wife , @entity121			1
according to investigators , @entity7 had said the last time he saw his wife was the night he and his sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left to go camping after midnight in freezing weather			1
police have said they will continue to investigate her disappearance despite the deaths			1
@entity105 said he tried to prevent the visitation			0
" we had warned the police ... everybody , that he ( @entity7 ) was capable of hurting those children and we were very concerned , " he said			1
but , apparently , the law allowed for it , according to @entity105			0
" i do n't think we could have done anything more , " he said			0
the grandfather restated his belief that his son - in - law , whom he described as very controlling and unlikeable , is responsible for @entity121 's disappearance			1
according to @entity105 , @entity7 bristled when he heard or saw evidence that the boys were close to their grandparents			1
the @entity145 said the boys at first would not talk about their missing mother , but they then opened up a little bit			2
one said he last saw her on a camping trip , @entity105 told @entity110			0
but then they would forget details or not want to talk about her			0
" they went back to a trained and coached response , " the grandfather said			0
" @entity7 did n't want them saying anything about it			1
" @entity0 's @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity110 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
