-- it 's no shock that people love to hate @entity3			1
on friday , for some , the emphasis shifted to hate as @entity3 went public , turning its ceo into a billionaire and , as @entity7 gracefully put it , making " thousands of millionaires " out of the rest of its staff and stockholders			1
" well most @entity15 are bitter and hateful toward anyone and anything more successful than themselves , " one commenter wrote on that story			2
" just me or anyone else really hoping for @entity3 stock to take a nose dive and never come back up ? i want to watch it drop like a rock , " one @entity23 user wrote on the eve of @entity3 's initial public offering thursday			1
the anti-social network : life without @entity3 here 's a rant from one financial analyst , spotted by @entity32 , which shares a parent company with @entity0 and authored a recent post called " sick of hearing about @entity3 ? you 're not alone			1
" " but do i really need to see another article about how the @entity39 dealers in @entity40 have brought in extra inventory in anticipation of all the new millionaires ? or how @entity46 and @entity47 housing prices , which were already sky - high , are soaring even higher from all the new money ? " the analyst , @entity44 , wrote			1
" i ca n't wait for this week to be over so we can talk about some other companies			2
" some of the venom online was directed at the @entity53 twins , those rowing - happy @entity54 kids who repeatedly have been suing for part of @entity3			1
dubbed " the @entity56 " in the film " @entity58 , " @entity59 and @entity53 are set to make millions off of @entity3 's ipo despite the fact that some courts have rejected their claims that @entity64 stole their idea for his blockbuster website			1
they could make $ 228 million for their 6 million shares in the company , according to a @entity7 gallery on @entity3 's new billionaires			1
at @entity73 , @entity72 writes that we all should give the @entity56 a bit of a break -- especially since they 've been good sports about their anti-fame : " sure , the @entity56 may sound a little cheesy finishing each other 's sentences -- a well - enunciated mix of locker - room pep talk and well - worn entrepreneurial web - 2.0 jargon -- and they will be subject to @entity86 - style internet - invention jokes until the end of time			2
but who 'd have known they 'd be such good sportsmen about it ? in the movie , @entity59 gets frustrated at one point and hollers			0
' screw it ! let 's gut the frigging nerd ! ' in real life , the twins seem to have become entirely content with chasing the nerd around the courts , and collecting their cut of the biggest tech @entity103 in history			0
" others are teasing ceo @entity64 himself			0
the comedian @entity107 posted a fake letter from the 28 - year - old to potential investors			0
it opens : " for years , you 've wasted your time on @entity3			1
now here 's your chance to waste your money on it , too			2
" it ends like this : " one last thing : what will , i , @entity64 , do with the $ 18 billion i 'm expected to earn from @entity3 's ipo ? well , i 'm considering buying @entity122 , but that would still leave me with $ 18 billion			1
friend me , @entity64 " according to the @entity125 , @entity3 's new billionaires may spend their money in subtle ( but still over-the - top ) ways			1
on thursday , the paper looked at spending culture in @entity40 , finding that the really rich types spend money in ways that are difficult to detect without a rich - person radar : " fabulous home theaters are tucked into the basements of plain suburban houses			2
@entity137 jeans that start at $ 1,200 can be detected only by a tiny red logo on the button			0
the hand - painted @entity143 bicycles that flash across @entity40 on saturday mornings have become the new @entity39 -- and only the cognoscenti could imagine that they cost more than $ 20,000 , " @entity140 writes for the paper			0
" even at @entity3 , ground zero for the nouveau tech riche , peer pressure dictates that consumption be kept on the down low			1
" part of the reason some people are frustrated with @entity3 this week is that all of us -- the users of @entity3 -- are essentially the ones making the company so much money			1
my colleague @entity158 looked at this on wednesday			0
if you want to make the point really personal , check out this widget , which will tell you exactly how many dollars your @entity3 page is making for the company			1
it 's an estimate , of course , but it brings the point home			0
here are details on the math they 're using to make the calculations , in case you 're feeling brainy			0
others used the opportunity to gripe about @entity3 's privacy settings , which are notoriously complicated ( perhaps since the company wants info to be public ) : " why is @entity3 going public ? they could n't figure out the privacy settings either , " wrote one @entity23 user			1
not all of the reaction is negative , of course			0
many tech bloggers and @entity187 watchers are cheering on @entity3 's run at the market , saying it 's yet another @entity192 expression of the @entity193			1
" in 2004 , who could have predicted that a @entity54 sophomore would be destined to lead his dorm - room creation to a gajillion - dollar ipo eight years later ? " wrote @entity194 at the @entity195			0
" @entity200 of @entity64 are dramatic , even epic , and -- you might say -- lyrical			0
" for more on that , check out this faux - musical about the company 's rise			0
" i 'm happy for @entity3 , @entity64 and others put in their own time efforts and own capital they deserve this reward , " another @entity23 pundit said			2
" @entity193 ! " some people will see this post and say , " yeah , yeah yeah			0
" that 's the tack @entity3 appears to be taking			2
according to the blog @entity219 , @entity3 's @entity217 office created a poster that counters all the negativity by saying " @entity227 gon na like " -- a riff on the site 's mechanism for sharing content with friends			1
the blog post ends with this little bit of sappy futurism : " @entity3 's mission is ' making the world more open and connected			2
' sometimes that means making people uncomfortable at first			0
you do n't have to agree with how @entity64 does things , and you can hate if you want to			0
but remember , @entity3 's just the messenger			2
the message is the future			0
" feel free to complain about that in the comments section .			0

@entity243 is set to create " thousands of millionaires "
that has led some to resent the site , which makes money off its users ' data
@entity3 tries to counter all the negativity by saying " @entity254 gon na like "
