@entity0 -- if you earn your living driving at speeds upward of 200 mph , chances are you do n't slow down even when you 're on vacation			2
that 's certainly the case for @entity10 driver @entity9			1
when not behind the wheel of the no. 83 car in the @entity13 , @entity9 is known as a bit of a daredevil : an avid skydiver , spear fisherman and scuba diver , to name a few of his extracurricular actives			1
in fact , @entity1 caught up with @entity9 on a recent trip to @entity0 to promote @entity23			1
but he did n't just hold a press conference ; instead , he invited the media to watch him scuba dive in the @entity28 exhibit at the @entity29			1
the four whale sharks that live in this exhibit were a new sight for the seasoned diver , and it was clear he was enjoying the experience			2
he also took notice of several of the groupers that seemed to be paying special attention to him			2
" i had a couple of groupers sneak up on me more than once			2
those are sneaky little guys			2
i guess it 's their mating season , so they were a little fired up			2
there 's a couple of guys on the track that will sneak up on you , " @entity9 said			1
after the dive , he took a moment to reflect on the top five destinations that satisfy his need for high - octane adventure			1
first on the list : @entity56 , @entity57			1
" @entity56 , @entity57 , i 'm a huge fan of			1
it 's just so beautiful out there			0
in the summer and the winter			0
... the summer is incredible just because of the beauty and the nature , the mountains and the hiking and the rafting and fishing			2
so many great outdoor activities , and i really love to be outdoors			0
" second on @entity9 ' list is the @entity70 in the @entity71 , where he enjoys the natural beauty as well			1
" the water 's incredible			0
there 's a lot of great diving and snorkeling and swimming and spear fishing			1
" @entity9 also looks forward to eating well when vacationing here			1
" there 's some good restaurants			0
more hole in the wall , island type places			2
it 's a very small community down there , " he said			0
destination number three is @entity89 , @entity90			0
" i really enjoy @entity89			0
very similar to @entity56 but unique in its own way			1
a little bit bigger town ... a little bit more vibrant night life , " @entity9 said			1
no. 4 on @entity9 ' list strays a little from the other favorites , but it feeds into two more of his passions : food and history			1
" i always really liked @entity103 because i absolutely am a history buff , and you can find something from almost every century in @entity103			0
it 's just to die for			0
@entity110 food is my favorite food , so that 's another reason i like it there			0
" and the final destination in @entity9 ' top five takes him back to the islands			1
" @entity116 is another favorite ... similar but different from the @entity118 , the @entity70			0
a lot more mountainous where the @entity70 are very , very flat			0
" @entity9 also enjoys swimming , diving and hiking here			1
he continued with his comparison between his two favorite island spots : " similar to comparing @entity125 ( @entity126 ) to @entity89 , i kinda compare the @entity70 to @entity116			0
one is very raw and natural and great in its own way , and the other has that , but is more modern and ( has ) better night life			0
" this is @entity9 ' top five list , but he 's quick to point out that it 's only five locations , and he loves exploring new places , cultures , experiences and of course , thrills			1
he is by no means ready to slow down on or off the track			0
" you know when you start to look at a globe , you start to realize even if you 've been a lot of places , you 've been nowhere			2
there 's just so much out there to explore , see and do			0
so i 'm anxious and excited to go do that			0
