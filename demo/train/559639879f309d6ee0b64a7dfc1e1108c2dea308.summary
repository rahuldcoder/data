-- an exclusive content network curated by the company and designed to enhance the customer 's in - store experience			1
@entity2 has been teasing @entity7 for months , but now that the network is about to go live we have a much clearer idea about the type of content provided and the purpose behind the digital endeavor			1
@entity2 's vice president of digital ventures @entity20 sat down with @entity0 in advance of the october 20 launch day for a complete tour			1
" the vision , " he says , " is for @entity7 to be a digital version of the community cork board that 's in all of our stores			0
" we 've known for some time that @entity7 would offer unfettered access to @entity31 , the @entity32 and @entity33 , but that 's just scratching the surface			0
@entity2 has manufactured a rich experience around each of its six channels : news , @entity40 , my neighborhood and the customer - personalized @entity2 channel			1
here 's a comprehensive breakdown of each channel : news : this section of @entity7 is comprised of @entity2 media partners offering premium or exclusive content to customers			1
the @entity32 has opened up access to its @entity55 subscription - based service for free , all content from the @entity31 is available minus the paywall and the exact replica of the @entity33 newspaper is accessible to users on the network			1
newly signed content partner good is providing early access to its infographics , so @entity2 customers can view them before anyone else			1
entertainment : @entity2 has populated the entertainment portion of its network with music , apps and books from @entity74 's @entity73 , full access to a selection of books picked by @entity2 and provided by the @entity78 ( via an @entity80 reader ) , business e-books courtesy of @entity82 , a kid - rich experience powered by @entity85 and handpicked documentary films provided by @entity87			1
wellness : health and fitness publisher @entity89 is the primary content provider for this @entity7 channel			0
customers have access to specialized content -- not available to anyone other than @entity2 customers -- from @entity97 , women 's health , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 ! , along with a custom built " @entity105 , @entity107 " application			1
business and careers : professional social networking site @entity110 is making exclusive video and blog content available to @entity3 users in this channel			2
the network also provides @entity110 job search and suggestions , and offers users a 30 - day free trial for the premium account			2
my neighborhood : @entity2 is adamant about creating a localized experience to connect customers with the community around the store			1
the company delivers on this objective by serving up content to users based on the exact whereabouts of the store where the user is accessing the free @entity3			0
community fare includes local news from @entity138 , and a look at nearby @entity141 classroom projects that could benefit from small contributions			0
foursquare users can check in via the web from @entity2 stores , and @entity146 makes available full ratings for restaurants in the surrounding area for free			2
@entity2 : this channel provides a personalized customer experience for @entity2 account / card management , and also amasses all of @entity2 social ( @entity156 / @entity155 / @entity154 ) and digital properties under one umbrella			1
we may be kicking a gift horse in the mouth , but one thing that struck us about @entity7 is that there 's almost too much content to go around			0
in some aspects the experience seems saturated and overwhelming , so customer 's may not know where to start and partners providing premium content may find some of it gets overlooked			0
we broached the subject with @entity20 who explained that @entity2 will be tracking user activity via web analytics to get a sense of what users respond to			2
the network is designed to feel fresh each time you come back and the three promo tiles on the home page rotate to engineer more than 40 unique experiences			0
it 's a priority for @entity2 to ensure that customers have easy access to content , and " that all the content partners are feeling like they have an equal shot , " @entity20 says			2
a premium mobile experience @entity7 certainly packs in a variety of content that makes for interesting material to explore on a laptop , but the network was also designed with the mobile user in mind			2
users accessing the network via mobile devices and tablets will benefit from the @entity80 smartphone - optimized network			2
@entity7 for mobile is also touchscreen - friendly , offering a hands - on , swipe - able experience			2
more than 50 % of users logging on to the free @entity3 are doing so from mobile devices , so the company was motivated by usage behaviors to build a mobile web experience just as good , if not better than , the standard web experience			0
content was also designed to be " snackable , " so the mobile user can get value even while waiting in line , says @entity20			0
where @entity216 fits in while @entity7 is cloaked in the @entity2 brand name , @entity216 actually plays a pivotal role in the behind - the - scenes network experience			1
@entity216 is the coffee retailer 's technology partner on the initiative , so it not only developed the site at @entity2 's behest , but it 's hosting the network , powering the search experience and providing content as well			1
@entity216 will also serve as a promotional partner for @entity7 , and market @entity7 on its site in the form of banner ads. the two partners hooked up after @entity2 approached @entity216 about the initiative			1
" they 're so strong in the three areas we knew we needed help with -- technology , content and search , " says @entity20 , " so we came to them ... and they were eager			0
" " they seemed excited by the local and unique nature of the @entity7 , " explains @entity20 on why @entity216 was eager to work with the trendy coffee retailer			2
the bottom line is choice one would assume , correctly so , that @entity2 has not gone to trouble of providing free @entity3 and a premium digital network without thinking about how it could profit by these pricey additions			1
if we did n't know better , we 'd presume that @entity2 was charging its partners for placement			0
instead , as we 've disclosed before , there 's no money changing hands -- unless @entity7 users make purchases from partners , in which case there is a revenue share			0
what it comes down is a matter of choice			0
coffee and tea drinkers have a myriad of options , so for @entity2 it 's about motivating the customer to choose its stores , and its digital network content partners by association			1
@entity7 is designed with two key objectives in mind , says @entity20 : enhancing the customer 's experience and better engaging customers while they 're in the store			0
" tens of millions of customers are coming in to our stores and logging in to our @entity3 on a monthly basis anyways			0
they 're coming in because we provide this great experience -- good music overhead , quality food and coffee and the opportunity to connect with your friends or the baristas ... what we hope is that this is a nice complement to that experience			0
" the engagement piece is centered around what @entity2 can do with location , and perhaps reveals a bit more about @entity216 's motivation to participate			1
" we 're really excited about the fact that we can leverage the location - based nature of the site to connect our customers with the communities around the stores , " he says			0
