-- the chaotic scene unfolded with flash - bang grenades , rubber bullets and clouds of smoke			0
canisters whizzed through the air amid deafening booms			0
@entity11 @entity10 @entity9 went down			1
" medic ! @entity12 ! " someone yelled			0
@entity14 , 24 , had seen his share of war in two tours of @entity18 as a @entity11			1
he was lucky , returning home physically unscathed			0
but tuesday evening , near the corner of @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity14 went down			1
the video images went viral : streams of crimson flowing down @entity14 's head , his black t - shirt adorned with a white dove of peace , the war veteran carried to a hospital			1
and with that , the @entity34 had a face			2
" we are all @entity9 , " declared its website			1
" it 's ironic , " said his uncle @entity39 , that @entity14 should be the poster child for this movement			1
ironic , said @entity14 's @entity11 buddy and current roommate @entity42 , that a young man who fought for @entity46 freedoms should be injured exercising those same freedoms at home			1
he was 14 at the time of the september 11 attacks and graduated in 2005 from @entity51 with the same sense of patriotism that drove so many young men and women to join the military			0
he was working at @entity57 and salads when he decided to enlist			0
soon , he was in @entity59 in the @entity60 for training and the next year on his way to war			2
@entity14 deployed twice with the @entity64 , @entity65 to @entity18 's @entity67 province , site of some the war 's fiercest battles			1
@entity42 said they often encountered makeshift bombs in their 2006 tour during which 15 of their fellow @entity11 died			0
@entity39 said @entity14 told him about a couple of close calls , one in which he rolled over a roadside bomb that somehow failed to detonate			1
@entity14 had always been a quiet , shy kid , @entity39 said			1
a computer whiz , not a jock			0
and not the type of young man his friends had expected to become an activist			0
but war touched @entity14 as it does almost everyone who comes that close			1
after his last tour of @entity18 , he returned home with serious misgivings and gravitated to @entity91 , a @entity11 himself who had returned from @entity95 feeling similarly			1
in small - town @entity98 , uncle and nephew talked to each other about the larger issues of war			1
" he came back thinking there were better ways to deal with things than war , " @entity39 said			2
@entity14 's parents , @entity39 said , did n't always understand the change in their son			1
but @entity39 felt an affinity for the young man			0
" i am so much more proud of him now than when he was in ( the @entity11 ) , because he followed through on his convictions , " @entity39 said			0
those convictions led @entity14 to @entity116 this year to join protests of a bill by gov. @entity119 to weaken organized labor in @entity98			1
" @entity9 thought the workers were getting screwed , " said @entity39 , who was on the streets with his nephew			1
this summer , @entity14 's friend @entity42 helped him get a job at @entity126 , a technology firm in @entity127			1
by then , @entity14 had become deeply involved with @entity128 and @entity129			2
at one event , he stood with a poster that read : " 32 veterans will try to commit suicide every day and 18 will succeed			0
" " he worried deeply about his fellow brothers and sisters who are veterans , " @entity39 said			0
that 's what prompted him to join the @entity34 , first in @entity127 and then across the bay in @entity23 , @entity39 said			1
@entity14 knew there were many veterans among @entity46 's down and out			1
for the past three weeks , he was working during the day and out all night at the occupy protests , @entity42 said			0
he came home only three or four times to the @entity147 apartment the two shared -- mainly to do laundry			0
still , the laid - back @entity14 was never a screamer			2
he felt strongly about economic injustice and wanted to add his voice quietly to the fight			0
and so , tuesday night , he was standing there , almost at parade rest , when he went down , witnesses said			0
he suffered a skull fracture and was in fair condition in the intensive care unit at @entity160 , a hospital spokesman said			2
@entity42 and @entity39 said @entity14 was conscious and communicating by writing on a notepad			2
@entity42 said he has been told @entity14 has asked to see him , but doctors have limited visitors			2
@entity14 's parents were with him at the hospital			1
meanwhile , @entity23 police are investigating how @entity14 was hurt			1
protesters gathered for a vigil in his name			0
national outcry over police treatment of the protesters -- many others were injured or sickened by tear gas -- prompted @entity23 mayor @entity176 to take responsibility for those who were hurt			2
and @entity9 became a household name			2
but back in @entity180 , @entity98 , @entity39 worried for his nephew			0
concussions , he said , can come back to haunt you , even after you get over the bruises			0
a lot of veterans know that from @entity18 and @entity187 , where head injuries have been common			2
only @entity14 's luck ran out here , in @entity46			1
@entity39 just hopes his nephew will recover to tell his own story			0
@entity0 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 returned from two tours of @entity18 without injury
but he suffered a fractured skull in the @entity23 protests
the videos went viral , and @entity14 became the face of the movement
his uncle says @entity18 changed his nephew 's views on war
