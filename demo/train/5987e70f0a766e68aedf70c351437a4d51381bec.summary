@entity0 , @entity1 -- images of destroyed homes , people sleeping in the streets and broken freeways reveal the recent tragedy of @entity9			1
who would think that after the horror of @entity13 , restless geological plates would so quickly wreak havoc in another nation ? the @entity16 seems at war with itself			0
but , as many have observed , @entity9 is not @entity19			1
@entity9 's economy is one of the fastest - growing in @entity22			1
this earthquake will do little to slow down that down			0
in @entity29 , dominated by industries , corporate offices and financial institutions , most people will return to work within a week			0
but there is another side of @entity9 for which the picture can not be as optimistic : the depressed areas that have never enjoyed the nation 's economic boom			1
these are " callampas , " or impoverished wards of major cities and small towns that have been bypassed by progress			0
unfortunately , the earthquake has hit these areas the hardest			0
the question is now , how will the government address these people 's need for housing and employment ? in stark contrast to the coast , inland from the quake 's epicenter are some of the finest vineyards in the country			0
they were spared by the tsunami that destroyed some coastal towns , and although they sustained some damage from the quake , their grapes will soon be on our tables to join the avocados and berries that @entity9 shares with the @entity68			1
in recent decades , the country has also become a major exporter of forest products			0
tree plantations and pulp factories are situated within a hundred - mile radius of the quake 's epicenter ; mills will return to production soon			2
farm - raised fish are harvested farther south , and these exports will likewise continue			2
and @entity9 's most important export continues to be copper and other minerals			1
the majority of these mines are in the northern desert , out of range of the quake 's damage			0
when copper prices reached all - time highs earlier in the decade , @entity9 created a multibillion - dollar " rainy day " fund , which it will now draw on to rebuild the country			1
but now the country 's greatest challenge will probably not be economic recovery ; rather , it will be social recovery			1
why ? the globalization model followed by @entity9 's @entity98 - trained economists is largely responsible for the nation 's affluence			1
these economists began as university professors , but under gen. @entity102 , they designed the key policies of trade , investment and employment			0
while this model promoted growth , it held down wages and benefits , which prevented many working - class people from benefiting from the country 's bonanza			2
the export - oriented economy did not create many higher - paid manufacturing jobs			1
unskilled , low - paying jobs predominated			1
the people employed in these positions are the most affected by the quake			0
in @entity29 , they occupy many of the older buildings in the hard - hit core of the city			2
on the coast near the epicenter , they live in the humble dwellings flooded or washed away by the tsunami			0
under @entity9 's globalization model , some inefficient coal mines in the @entity131 area closed in the 1990s when they could no longer compete with higher - grade , cheaper coal from @entity135			1
the same occurred with the area 's textile mills			0
as a result , unemployment is higher in the quake area than in the country as a whole , a situation that promises to worsen in the aftermath			2
since democracy returned to @entity9 in 1990 , a coalition of center - left parties has governed the nation			1
although it has addressed social issues and sharply reduced the nation 's poverty rate , the booming economy , " which raises all boats , " has yet to get theirs off the beach			1
for many , the tsunami sank their boat			0
president - elect @entity160 , who takes office march 11 , is the first moderate - conservative in two decades to govern @entity9			1
ideologically , he opposes an activist state , which addresses poverty as an issue separate from general economic prosperity			2
his first public statement after the quake called for public order and an end to vandalism			0
he also urged repairing water and energy services			0
once in office , he will need to rebuild freeways , bridges and public buildings as quickly as possible			2
this will create many jobs			2
but @entity160 , an advocate of privatization , has spoken of no plans to modify globalization policies : a plan to lift those boats			1
@entity9 leaders have a mixed record in rebuilding after severe quakes ; effected areas rarely recovered well			1
in 1906 , the country 's main port of @entity192 suffered a devastating quake only four months after @entity194 was almost destroyed			0
the rebuilding was slow as the country 's economic center definitively shifted from the port inland to @entity29			2
when a severe quake hit in 1939 , the @entity200 government created a new business - government economic model to address the crisis			1
in 1960 , the largest quake in world history decimated the picturesque port of @entity207			0
buildings sank , and rural grazing land turned into lakes			0
the conservative government borrowed heavily abroad and tried a number of fiscal innovations to get the country on its feet			0
past governments rebuilt @entity192 and @entity207 , but the cities never regained their former leadership roles			2
the recent @entity131 quake hit @entity9 's second - largest industrial city			1
as the government rebuilds it , and the city attempts to regain its prominence , @entity160 must carefully weigh how his privatization model will help those most affected by this tragedy			0
the people in depressed communities need jobs , housing and education			0
@entity9 will continue to provide economic leadership in the hemisphere , but in addressing this current tragedy , can the nation provide social leadership as well ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

@entity240 says that *unlike* @entity19 , @entity9 can rebuild on strong economy
but existing problems of low - wage jobs , unemployment now made worse , he says
*incoming* president must modify globalization goals , focus on social problems , he says
@entity240 : @entity9 must provide social leadership , not just economic
