-- the slaughter of civilians in @entity3 goes on with too little attention			1
but when @entity6 gets involved , the world takes notice			1
and that 's at least a step in the right direction			0
@entity6 brought the media spotlight with him friday , as he protested outside the @entity3 embassy in @entity13 and was arrested alongside his father , longtime newsman @entity14			1
on wednesday morning there were crowds lining the hallways of the @entity18 , a reception more suited to a movie star than a hearing of the @entity22			0
inside the packed wood - paneled committee room , @entity6 testified about his most recent trip into the remote @entity26 region of @entity3 with @entity28 co-founder @entity27 , where they found themselves in a rocket attack and brought home harrowing footage of children freshly mangled by rockets and bombs pushed out of airplanes			1
the president of @entity3 , @entity38 , who has been indicted as a war criminal by the @entity40 , and defense minister @entity41 are repeating a cycle of ethnic cleansing they infamously perpetrated in @entity45 a half - decade ago			2
" they are proving themselves to be the greatest war criminals of this century by far , " @entity6 testified			2
why @entity6 got himself arrested in a perfect world , the sight of a government slaughtering its own people would provoke enough outrage and attention			1
but this is not a perfect world , and when atrocities occur outside camera range it is difficult to get the world to care about the slaughter of their fellow human beings			0
that 's why @entity6 envisioned the @entity64 , administered by the @entity65 and the @entity66 , which uses satellite surveillance technology to pierce the isolation of the @entity70 nation			1
this allows anyone with a computer to be a witness to troop movements , while providing evidence of attacks and burnt villages			1
" we are the anti-genocide paparazzi , " @entity6 is fond of saying			2
the effect is a powerful role reversal -- dictators can no longer hide in the dark			0
it is difficult to keep people in the western world engaged in the ongoing slaughters in @entity89 and the civil war in @entity91 , let alone those in the isolated mountain region of @entity3			1
but state - sponsored murderers bet on our short attention span and lack of follow - through			0
they know the cameras will eventually go away and then they believe they can go back to killing with impunity			0
that 's why @entity6 's sustained focus on @entity3 -- and his strategic self - deployment at carefully timed intervals -- has helped keep both light and heat on the @entity70 government in @entity107			1
when i traveled to what is now the @entity110 with @entity6 a year ago for @entity111 to witness a successful independence referendum , @entity112 -- the former " lost boy " known to @entity114 as the subject of a " fictionalized memoir " by @entity117 , " @entity112 " -- told me that @entity6 's involvement in @entity3 " saved millions of lives " by drawing the world 's attention to the region and reducing the chance of another north - south civil war			1
@entity6 is the first to admit that his star power can only help illuminate the problem ; it takes policy makers and political leaders to make direct changes that can save lives by stopping a conflict from escalating			2
what 's equally clear is that @entity6 can serve as a " gateway drug " into these issues , provoking more people to care and inspiring a new generation to help stop suffering half a world away			2
@entity6 is trying to use his celebrity to get us to care about something more important than celebrity , an important wake - up call			0
but then it is up to each of us to take the next step and focus on humanitarian crises where they occur			0
we must add our own small wattage to the spotlight of international attention and assure the victims of state - sponsored violence that they will not be ignored , while sending murderous dictators the message that they have no place to hide in the 21st century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity163 : @entity6 , arrested at friday protest , draws spotlight to @entity3
he says world looks away , so @entity6 backs satellite surveillance initiative over @entity3
he says this strategy allows anyone with computer to bear witness to troop movements , attacks
@entity163 : @entity6 sets example of how we should all be holding brutal dictatorship *accountable*
