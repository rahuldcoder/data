-- he started his first business venture as a street vendor with capital of just $ 200 but two decades later @entity5 has become one of @entity8 's most prominent businessmen			1
like many in his country , @entity5 fled @entity8 in 1989 to escape the @entity13 country 's ruinous civil war			1
he found refuge in @entity15 but in december 1991 @entity5 decided it was time to return to his native country			2
once back in the capital @entity20 , the former refugee quickly realized he could capitalize on a need for one product : rubber flip - flops			2
" when the war took place people had to be displaced from another point to another point , " remembers @entity5 , founder of @entity24 and sons			2
" so in the process of that , they do n't take their shoes and they walk with their bare feet			0
and the $ 200 that i brought from @entity15 , i decided to invest that into the slippers			0
" read this : ' @entity40 @entity39 ' dances to the mobile phone beat that initial investment in rubber flip - flops made quick returns			0
@entity46 's business grew steadily and by 2005 the self - made businessman owned three retail stores selling items such as paper products and cosmetics imported from all over the world			1
with an entrepreneurial spirit , @entity5 next set his sights on making the transition from being an importer to becoming a manufacturer			2
thus , in 2010 he launched @entity58 , @entity8 's first paper and toiletry product manufacturing company			1
" i figured out that our population is about four million , " he says			0
" out of the four million , no one is producing paper -- everybody is going out to bring the paper to import			2
even if two million people buy from me by day , i feel that it 's something like we 'll grow the economy of this country			2
" the company 's factory became operational earlier this year , producing four different kinds of products : baby diapers , paper towels , napkins and toilet paper			1
@entity8 : from warzone to holiday paradise ? with sales having so far reached more than $ 600,000 , @entity5 says his plans are to double the factory 's capacity by the end of next year			1
" since i started this company with $ 200 i feel like other people can make it too , " says @entity5			1
" i do not hire family ; i personally find citizens , some who have never seen such a machine in their life and i train them and watch them improve			0
i believe if i can do it , so can they and that 's what 's gratifying			0
" yet , running a manufacturing business in @entity8 -- a country torn apart by a civil war that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and destroyed much of its infrastructure and economy -- is not without big challenges			1
" number one , we do n't have the power or energy in our country at this time -- we 're running on a generator , " says @entity5			1
" you tell anyone that i 'm running a factory as big as this only on a generator , they 'll tell you that you are crazy , " he adds			0
unreliable power and poor infrastructure , coupled with high energy costs and a lack of skilled labor , are all major problems for entrepreneurs doing business in @entity8			1
read this : guns become weapons of mass creation but there is one business area @entity46 is not concerned about			0
" for the challenge of distribution , " he says , " i do n't have a problem with that			0
" " one supermarket in @entity8 , @entity138 supermarket , they are the number one customer to me -- they do n't buy tissue from anyone beside me , " adds @entity5			1
" and out of all the other small shops and centers i already have over 1,500 members			0
" looking ahead , @entity5 says his next goal is to expand the business outside @entity8			1
" i would like to see myself outside of the country , " he says			0
" i want to get other countries in @entity150 and export to @entity152 and to @entity154 markets			0
