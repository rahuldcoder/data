-- many residents returning to their homes in southern @entity3 after @entity4 will find little comfort			1
throughout the state , at least 13,000 homes were damaged , @entity6 , a spokeswoman for the @entity7 and @entity8 , said tuesday			2
she stressed the figure is a preliminary estimate , and that officials expect the number will rise as they gain access to some of the hardest - hit areas			0
@entity18 , west of @entity19 , suffered extensive flooding after @entity4 struck the northern @entity21 last week			1

" in nearby @entity45 , floodwaters are still flowing out			1
" we got a long way to go			2
it 's so much water , " parish president @entity48 told @entity31			1
" it 's going to be some time before it all gets out of here			0
" he said authorities hope to patch levee breaches and then use pumps to get the rest of the water out			2
@entity48 also praised the work of the federal government , just one day after president @entity58 was in the area to offer assistance and view the damage			2
throughout the state , roughly 40,000 customers were without power tuesday , down from a peak of 903,000 , according to the @entity68			0
those without power must contend with a new obstacle : rebuilding their lives amid blistering temperatures and no air conditioning			0
the @entity73 issued a heat advisory tuesday for some areas without power , including the cities of @entity77 and @entity19			0
" the cumulative affect of typically hot and humid conditions combined with the lack of climate control due to power outages from @entity4 have created a life - threatening situation , " the weather service said			1

" this is a serious condition that can kill you			0

authorities were still dealing with threats posed by rain - swollen rivers and lakes , particularly in @entity125 , northeast of @entity19			0
standing water can serve as ripe breeding ground for mosquitoes and the @entity129 urged residents to take care to protect themselves against @entity133 virus , which has killed at least nine people in the state this year			1
how communities bounce back from disaster on monday , @entity58 praised rescuers and volunteers helping clean up after @entity4 and offered federal help to beef up flood protection in the stricken area			1

it had already killed 19 people in the @entity175 nation of @entity176 , where it struck before moving into the @entity178			1
the storm posed the first real test to @entity19 since a $ 14.5 billion federal effort to reconstruct the city 's flood control system after it failed during @entity171 in 2005			2
@entity171 killed almost 1,800 people , most when the storm overwhelmed the levee system and flooded the city			2
