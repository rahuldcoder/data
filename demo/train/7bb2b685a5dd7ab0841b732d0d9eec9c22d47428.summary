-- the @entity2 title race is shaping up to be one of the closest in years -- and the battle for the " pichichi " is also hotting up			0
while @entity7 matched the 1 - 0 victory by league - leading city rival @entity9 on saturday , @entity6 kept in touch with @entity12 at the top of the @entity14 scoring charts by emulating the world player of the year 's decisive strike			1
@entity12 's first - half winner at @entity19 meant @entity9 will head into next weekend 's " @entity21 " clash with defending champion @entity22 holding a three - point advantage over second - placed @entity7			1
it was his 25th goal in the league this season and 39th in all competitions , with @entity12 firing home in trademark style after cutting into the penalty area from the left following a crossfield pass from @entity34			2
@entity12 missed several other chances , and his collision with teammate @entity37 resulted in the @entity39 striker going off injured			0
" we had chances to score the second goal but unfortunately we were n't able to get it and then when the score is 1 - 0 you always suffer , " said coach @entity40			0
" it was n't a great game in terms of how we played , but we showed good attitude and were very solid defensively			0
" @entity51 - born @entity6 , hoping to win a @entity53 place this year with his adopted @entity54 , netted for the 22nd time in the league -- and 30th overall -- as he broke clear of the visiting @entity59 defense 10 minutes after halftime and coolly beat the keeper			1
the @entity7 clubs are moving clear of @entity22 , who are seven points behind @entity9 ahead of sunday 's home clash with @entity66			1
@entity67 has won the @entity68 for the past two years , but is 10 behind @entity12 after an injury - hit season so far			2
the @entity70 is not even @entity22 's top scorer in the league -- that honor goes to @entity75 's @entity74 , who has 16			0
in saturday 's other matches , @entity76 won 1 - 0 at fellow midtable side @entity78 while @entity79 moved three points clear of the relegation zone with a 3 - 1 win over second - bottom @entity83			2
@entity85 @entity84 champions @entity86 moved 23 points clear at the top of the table with a 2 - 1 win at home to fourth - placed @entity93 , meaning coach @entity94 could win his first league title with the club next weekend with eight matches to spare			1
goals from @entity99 and @entity100 helped the @entity102 champions shrug off the midweek jailing of club president @entity104 for tax evasion , as @entity107 's late consolation could not prevent @entity86 's 16th successive league win			1
second - placed @entity109 suffered a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity111 , and @entity113 's team will surrender the title race if more points are dropped next weekend			2
@entity116 , who moved up to third with friday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity118 , must also win to stop @entity86 clinching a second successive title -- and 24th overall			1
@entity109 's defeat meant @entity116 closed to within a point of their rivals ahead of the derby clash on march 25			0
@entity126 @entity125 @entity127 moved up to fourth place with a 2 - 0 win at @entity130 , thanks to goals from @entity70 forward @entity133 and @entity135 defender @entity134			1
it was the third win in a row for @entity139 's side , but @entity140 can reclaim the @entity142 berth by beating @entity143 on sunday			0
@entity144 @entity145 third - placed @entity146 missed a chance to close the gap on @entity149 in second after being held 0 - 0 at home by @entity152			0
@entity149 travel to fifth - placed @entity154 on saturday , while champions @entity155 will seek to extend an eight - point advantage at the top against fourth side @entity158 .			0

@entity12 scores winner at @entity19 to maintain @entity9 's lead

@entity86 march closer to a 24th @entity85 @entity84 title
