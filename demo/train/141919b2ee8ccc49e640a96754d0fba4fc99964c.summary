@entity0 is upon us again			2
time for the drinking world to pull on an unamusing leprechaun hat and order pints of the black stuff in a fake @entity7 accent			1
but why do we only celebrate the @entity9 's contribution to conviviality when there are other nations out there who love to wallow in drink just as much ? in the interest of equality , we herewith embark on a global pub crawl to see who else we should invite to the party			1
promise to drink responsibly and you can join us			1
@entity22 @entity22 are no longer the great drinkers they once were			1
unlikely as it seems for a country where culture usually refers to something that grows in the folds of discarded sportswear , many @entity22 have become refined in their tastes			1
cheap lager is no longer cheap and , regardless , beer has been usurped by fancy wines			2
still , they have a fine legacy			2
this is a country whose former prime minister , the legendary @entity36 , was once in the @entity38 for sculling 2.5 pints of beer in 2.5 seconds			0
old habits die hard though , so if you do go drinking with @entity22 , you must still abide by the rules of " the shout			1
" this means once you 've accepted a drink as part of a round , you 're obliged to " shout " everyone else a beverage in return -- a costly business now that they 're all on the wine			1
classic drink : " @entity59 " or a " @entity60 " -- typically @entity55 - mangled wine varietals consumed either pre- or post-stubbie ( of beer )			1
hangover cure : @entity62 , leftover pizza , pies , fry - ups , 3 a.m. souvlakis and even @entity67 and cheese sandwiches are all favorites			1
but sculling 2.5 pints of beer in 2.5 seconds will do the trick every time			0
* * @entity71 does not recommend this			0
nor will it clean up afterward			0
@entity74 think of @entity74 and the chances are you 're thinking of a flaxen - haired fraulein hauling vast steins of beer through crowds of moustachioed men in leather shorts to the sound of an oompah band			1
or perhaps you think about @entity85			0
@entity74 may not be @entity88 's biggest beer drinkers -- that honor goes to the @entity90 -- but somehow they 've cornered the market in celebrating its consumption			1
this is largely thanks to @entity94 , @entity96 's month - long answer to @entity0			1
in reality , although @entity74 do have a taste for hops , barley , malt and water , most drink steadily in rather more mundane circumstances			1
this is because beer can be bought and consumed not just in bars , but in shops , gas stations , newspaper stands and on public transport			0
often without the aid of lederhosen or the sound of parping brass			0
classic drink : white wine spritzer			1
hangover cure : herring and raw onion			1
but you 'll need more beer to fix your herring breath			0
@entity124 @entity124 leads its @entity126 neighbors for alcohol intake , largely thanks to a rampant trade in illegally made rotgut and a winning formula of booze made from bananas			0
high on the menu is a potent liquor called waragi , also known as war gin because it was once used to fortify troops			1
though drinking too much inevitably leads to surrender			1
classic drink : @entity139 -- a semi-fermented beer drunk from communal pots using long straws			1
hangover cure : @entity144 -- another winning formula : meat cooked in banana leaves			1
@entity148 in @entity148 , booze acts like a pressure valve , allowing people to vent frustrations			1
booze also acts as a lubricant , oiling the wheels of business			1
and , of course , booze acts like booze , getting people drunk			0
@entity148 's strict social protocols seem to dissolve in alcohol , with the most hierarchical of relationships turning to brotherhoods by the end of the night , or early morning			1
a good session involves rapidly soaking up as many " bombs " ( mixtures using " golden ratios " of whiskey and beer ) as possible and then speaking ( or slurring ) what 's left of your mind , preferably to your boss			0
to aid this process , glasses are emptied and quickly filled			0
later , inevitably , stomachs are filled and quickly emptied			0
classic drink : soju -- to fans , a spirit capable of saving souls			1
to critics , cheap , sweet vodka			0
hangover cure : @entity186 -- a spicy ox blood broth			1
sounds like a hangover , tastes like a cure			1
also on @entity71 : how to survive a @entity192 drinking session 6			2
@entity193 this tiny former @entity195 state has earned a reputation for boozing thanks to some @entity199 stats that placed it top of the table ( surely under the table ? ) for alcohol consumption			0
there 's been a lot of grumbling about where these numbers came from , particularly as they indicate most people would be too sozzled to respond accurately to any survey			0
if they are drinking to excess , the @entity193 have a decent selection of homegrown wines to choose from			2
they also have their own versions of popular @entity215 fruit brandies			0
these have the same effect as knocking yourself on the head with a hammer , but without the unnecessary expense of buying a hammer			0
classic drink : @entity224 -- a sweet , malty fermentation only marginally less disgusting than pickle juice			1
hangover cure : pickle juice			2
@entity229 you know you 're off to a bad start when the local liquor is known as " hangover in a bottle			1
" the best - selling @entity236 is a cheap but brain - penetratingly potent juice made from sugar cane that will get even the hairs on your head drunk after a couple of sips			2
there is a drinking etiquette in @entity229			1
you must wait until a toast is made until you take the first sip of your drink			2
after that , you 're on your own , but it hardly matters since no one -- least of all you -- will remember anything about it			2
another headbanging local hooch , not the posh champagne			2
hangover cure : in a country known for its coffee , obviously the best cure is oregano tea			2
@entity262 the @entity263 may sneer at the uncivilized drinking habits of their @entity215 neighbors , but they 're usually sneering with a glass of @entity263 vin close at hand			2
in @entity262 , wine is consumed alongside every meal except breakfast			0
it 's often more freely available , and cheaper , than water			0
only @entity263 wines will do though			0
despite regularly losing taste tests to @entity278 rivals , the @entity262 remain steadfastly loyal to their own vineyards , almost to the point of denial			0
supermarkets rarely sell alcohol that is n't @entity263			0
they 're happy to eat snails , but they wo n't touch @entity288 beer			0
classic drink : @entity290 -- bold , peppery and over-confident			1
in other words : @entity263			0
hangover cure : onion soup			2
sorry , @entity263 onion soup			0
@entity295 for better or worse , drinking is a way of life in @entity295			2
not something that 's necessarily done for enjoyment , but something that 's stoically endured			0
like a @entity303 winter , gloomy literature or a shirtless political leader			0
@entity309 @entity309 's rapid economic expansion has seen it become a major consumer of oil , steel and other raw materials			0
with all that thirsty work , it must surely also have its eyes on the rest of the world 's refreshments			0
in the meantime , apart from @entity322 billionaires splurging on us $ 10,000 bottles of @entity324 , the @entity309 mostly stick to fiery grain - based liquors			2
the @entity309 love celebratory drinking			2
weddings , birthdays and business deals are all good excuses			0
drinking takes the form of a series of increasingly incomprehensible toasts			2
to the outsider , this might seem tortuous			0
just wait until the karaoke starts			0
classic drink : @entity340 -- a white spirit that can also be used to clean vomit from inside a taxi			1
hangover cure : congee -- a porridge - like soup that unfortunately resembles stuff that could have been cleaned out of a taxi			1
@entity349 while the @entity7 have one date to celebrate their country 's abiding love of alcohol , the @entity350 have three : yesterday , today and tomorrow			1
the near - constant drinking in the @entity350 revolves around the pub. after a few pints , sometimes the pub begins to revolve , too			1
alcohol is used by many @entity360 to overcome their traditional reserve			0
and so pubs are the places where relationships begin and end , deals are struck , scores are settled and the whole theater of life plays out to its dramatic conclusion			0
a range of light snacks may also be available			0
classic drink : pint of bitter -- traditional ale that , contrary to popular belief , is rarely served warm			1
hangover cure : full @entity379 breakfast -- a greasy plate of fried meat that , contrary to health and safety regulations , is rarely served warm			1

@entity22 -- *pretensions* to *sophistication* , but *pronounce* @entity387 " @entity60 "
@entity148 -- where late - night drinking sessions grease the wheels of *industry*
@entity229 -- local tipple is called " hangover in a bottle "
@entity349 -- do not believe the promise of dinner . going for a drink means exactly , and only , that
