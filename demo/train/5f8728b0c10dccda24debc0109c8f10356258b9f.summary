@entity0 -- the @entity2 spent friday on the defensive , after details got out about an internal audit that found the agency had broken privacy rules " thousands of times each year " since 2008			1
the audit was first reported by the @entity10 on thursday , setting off another round of heated discussion -- and criticism -- in @entity0 over how the @entity2 had wrongly impinged on @entity15 ' privacy			1
" i ... will continue to demand honest and forthright answers from the intelligence community , " said sen. @entity16 , @entity17 , noting the @entity18 he chairs will hold a hearing on the @entity10 's revelations			1
" i remain concerned that we are still not getting straightforward answers from the @entity2			2
" in a call with reporters friday , @entity25 -- the @entity2 's director of compliance -- acknowledged " mistakes occur , " even as he insisted only a " tiny " amount of such problems were intentional			1
" no one at @entity2 thinks a mistake is ok , " @entity25 said several times in the call , which a spokesman said was conducted to " address inaccuracies			1
" @entity2 leaker @entity36 -- whose ongoing leaks have riled the @entity39 administration and intelligence community -- provided the material to the @entity10 earlier this summer			1
the may 2012 audit found 2,776 incidents of " unauthorized collection , storage , access to or distribution of legally protected communications " in the preceding 12 months , the @entity10 reported in its story			1
many involved failures of due diligence or violations of standard operating procedure , " said the @entity10 article by reporter @entity51			2
" the most serious incidents included a violation of a court order and unauthorized use of data about more than 3,000 @entity15 and green - card holders			0
" @entity16 was not the only lawmaker , nor the only member of president @entity39 's @entity65 party , to call for more oversight and hearings			2
" press reports that the @entity2 broke privacy rules thousands of times per year and reportedly sought to shield required disclosure of privacy violations are extremely disturbing , " said @entity69 minority leader @entity68			1
@entity68 called for " rigorous oversight " by @entity76 on the " incidents of non-compliance			0
" another @entity79 from @entity80 , @entity82 chairwoman sen. @entity81 , told the @entity10 in a statement late thursday night that her committee " can and should do more to independently verify that @entity2 's operations are appropriate , and its reports of compliance incidents are accurate			1
" the @entity10 reported that most incidents involved unauthorized surveillance of @entity15 or foreign intelligence targets in the country			1
in one case , the @entity2 decided it did n't need to report the unintended surveillance			2
in 2008 , a " large number " of calls placed from @entity0 were intercepted due to a programming error that confused the capitol 's 202 area code for 20 , the international dialing code for @entity98			0
the information came from a " quality assurance " review that was n't distributed to the @entity2 overnight staff , according to the @entity10			1
separately , an @entity2 new collection method went undiscovered by the @entity106 for months			0
the court , which has authority over some of the agency 's operations , ruled it unconstitutional			0
responding to the @entity10 's story , the @entity2 said , " a variety of factors can cause the numbers of incidents to trend up or down from one quarter to the next			1
" factors can include implementation of new procedures , technology or software changes and expanded access			0
" the one constant across all of the quarters is a persistent , dedicated effort to identify incidents or risks of incidents at the earliest possible moment , implement mitigation measures wherever possible , and drive the numbers down , " the agency said			0
the agency released another statement thursday night defending its programs			0
" @entity2 's foreign intelligence collection activities are continually audited and overseen internally and externally , " it said			1
" when @entity2 makes a mistake in carrying out its foreign intelligence mission , the agency reports the issue internally and to federal overseers -- and aggressively gets to the bottom of it			2
" on friday , @entity25 said his agency " detects and corrects mistakes " as these occur and are identified , which stops them from being " propagated			0
" " the @entity2 has zero tolerance for misconduct , " he said , noting that those who make repeated mistakes lose access to key databases			2
overall , @entity25 insisted , the @entity2 carefully adheres to privacy protections			2
@entity69 spokesman @entity155 offered a similar statement friday , saying the @entity2 compliance office 's review reflects its commitment to abiding by the law and protecting people 's privacy			1
" the documents demonstrate that the @entity2 is monitoring , detecting , addressing and reporting compliance incidents , " @entity155 said			2
the man who leaked the audit to the @entity10 , @entity36 , stepped forward publicly in june to claim responsibility for leaking to the media that the @entity2 had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the @entity15			1
the agency also collected information from @entity15 companies on the internet activity of overseas residents , he said			0
@entity36 fled first to @entity176 and then to @entity177 before @entity178 granted him temporary asylum despite pressure from the @entity39 administration to return him to the @entity15 to face charges			0
he has been charged with three felony counts , including violations of the @entity15 @entity185 , for the leaks			0
@entity2 : we read .00004 % of web traffic although polling shows @entity15 harbor skepticism of the domestic surveillance programs @entity36 revealed , a majority of @entity15 do n't approve of the actions he took and they think he , as an @entity15 citizen , should be brought to justice			1
a @entity1 / @entity199 survey released last month indicated that 52 % of the public disapproved of @entity36 's actions , while 44 % said they approved of the leaks			0
fifty - four percent of those questioned in the poll said the government should attempt to bring @entity36 back to the @entity15 and prosecute him for his leaks			0
as for the program @entity36 revealed , there is a noticeable generational divide on the surveillance tactics , with younger @entity15 more likely to support @entity36 than older @entity15			0
@entity1 's @entity212 and @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
