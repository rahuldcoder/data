-- @entity2 's defense team formally requested monday that the @entity4 judge assigned to their client 's case be removed after she revealed her husband works with a @entity0 legal analyst			1
@entity11 's office filed paperwork monday asking that @entity14 circuit judge @entity13 not preside over second - degree murder proceedings involving @entity2 , according to @entity17 spokeswoman @entity16			1
the motion to " disqualify " the trial judge " will be ruled on in the appropriate manner , " @entity16 said monday			0
@entity2 , a 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer , fatally shot teenager @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity4 , on february 26 , a killing he has said was in self - defense			0
since then , the case has stirred civil rights activists nationwide and drawn intense publicity			0
@entity28 : guns , not race , key issue in @entity21 case @entity13 is assigned to the @entity2 case			1
but on friday , she said she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial after discovering that her husband is a law partner of @entity35 , an attorney whom @entity2 approached about representing him and has since widely commented on the case in the media			1
@entity35 is now a @entity0 contributor , providing analysis on this case			1
@entity35 told @entity0 that @entity2 " contacted my office , attempting to reach me , and wanted to hire me to represent him " on march 13			1
one of his law partners relayed that request to @entity35 , who declined			0
he explained later that he knew how taking on " big national cases ( can ) take a lot out of you " and wanted to have more time to spend with his children			0
" i decided simply not to , " the @entity50 lawyer said			0
a friend of @entity2 's later repeated the request in a direct conversation with @entity35 early last week , just as lawyers @entity54 and @entity56 said they 'd no longer represent @entity2			2
by then , @entity35 noted he 'd been hired by @entity0 to serve as an analyst			2
@entity35 again said he could not represent @entity2 and offered the names of five lawyers -- topped by @entity11 -- who might be considered instead			1
" they said @entity11 is the one we want , i put them together , and they took it from there , " said @entity35			0
@entity11 had indicated on friday that the defense might request a new judge , when he said the association between @entity69 and the @entity70 might become " more and more problematic " given the scrutiny the case is receiving			1
he told @entity0 on monday night that he was confident the request to pull @entity13 off the case would succeed			1
" if it is reasonably well - founded and sworn to , it 'll be granted , " @entity11 said			0
insisting that there had been " full transparency , " @entity35 said monday that he understood why @entity2 's defense team asked for the judge 's removal -- because of his involvement in the case and his professional relationship with her husband -- and was content that the matter is now in the legal system 's control			1
" everybody just needs to do the right thing , file it and let the process ( be resolved ) properly , " @entity35 said			0
meanwhile , news media organizations , including @entity0 , petitioned @entity13 on monday to reverse an order sealing court records in @entity2 's prosecution			1
prosecutors did not object when @entity2 's attorneys asked @entity13 to seal records last week			2
the judge ordered the court filings and other records sealed " without giving the public and press an opportunity to oppose closure , " the media said in its motion			2
@entity4 law requires a judge to consider whether the records closure is needed to " prevent a serious and imminent threat " to justice , the media members argued			0
the court must also find that there is no alternative to sealing the records that would provide a fair trial and that the action would not be " broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose , " they said			0
@entity2 's attorneys did not address those issues or present any evidence , the motion said			1
older brother : @entity21 was a happy teen " in case after case in @entity4 , courts -- including the @entity124 -- have held that prominence and publicity are not synonymous with prejudice and impartiality , and have cautioned against assuming that all potential jurors follow the news and retain what they read and watch , " the media filing says			0
jurors who ca n't set aside their biases created by exposure to pretrial publicity can be screened out during jury selection , the media motion argued			0
besides @entity0 , several broadcasting and newspaper companies -- including the publishers of @entity144 , the @entity145 and the @entity146 -- are part of the effort to unseal the documents			2
@entity11 said monday that he favors keeping documents sealed in this case in large part because of concerns that witnesses might be contacted and in danger if certain information is released			1
" ( @entity158 ) overall philosophy ( is ) to keep the information flow concentrated within the court system , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's much better handled there			0
" as to his client , @entity11 said he speaks " at least a couple times a day " with @entity2 , whom he described as doing well physically but " frightened			1
" @entity2 is scheduled to return to court friday for a bail hearing			0
@entity11 says that he hopes his client will be eligible for bond after that hearing and eventually be allowed to go free until the trial			2
if he does get out , though , the lawyer said there are legitimate fears about @entity2 's safety			1
" there have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case , and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways , " @entity11 said .			2

new : @entity11 describes his client , @entity2 , as " frightened "
new : the lawyer says he 's confident the judge will be removed from the case
new : the @entity0 analyst tied to the motion says " the process " will resolve the issue
media outlets are asking that documents in the case be unsealed
