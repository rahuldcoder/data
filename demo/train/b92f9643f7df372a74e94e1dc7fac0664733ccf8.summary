the @entity4 , which has been best the best - selling console for years , is about to lose its first place position			1
while @entity1 intends to respond to the @entity18 threat by cutting the @entity4 's price next month , it looks like the gaming company has another trick up its sleeve : a brand new hd console			1
according to @entity25 's sources , @entity1 plans to unveil a new console at the @entity28 conference in @entity29 in june or potentially sooner			0
very little is known about the rumored console , not even the name ( @entity4 2 ? @entity4 hd ? @entity4 360 ? ) , but it 's likely to be more powerful than the @entity10 or the @entity9 , according to @entity34			1
@entity1 has apparently been showing off the system to third - party developers so they can prepare titles for the console 's eventual launch in late 2012			2
the @entity4 captured the hearts and minds of casual gamers with its innovative controller system and its lower price point , but the specs and visuals of its rival consoles are far stronger , giving them greater longevity			0
@entity11 has also mitigated the @entity4 's advantage with causal gamers , thanks to @entity14			2
perhaps that 's what is driving @entity1 's rumored decision to be first on the market with a new console			0
