in january of 2011 , at 25 , i was diagnosed with @entity2 's lymphoma			1
i went through four months of chemotherapy and eight weeks of radiation			2
as of this writing , one and half years later , i 'm happy to be in remission , but many people think that is where the battle ends			2
for me , that 's where the real fight began			1
after all of the procedures were over and my hair finally grew back , the physical side of being a cancer patient was behind me			1
there was some relief in knowing that i 'd no longer have to spend hours over the toilet vomiting partially digested @entity22 because that was the only semi-solid food my body would tolerate			0
it was also refreshing to know that my appearance was slowly morphing from a powdery white , emaciated , bald , albino - looking bag of bones to a somewhat normal and healthy 25 - year - old guy			0
but shortly after the treatment stopped , the psychological stress of being a cancer patient set in			1
every month , since my last day of radiation , i go to my doctor for a battery of tests designed to determine whether my cancer has come back and whether the treatment caused any residual side effects			1
it 's a seven - day process that causes more mental anguish than any single person deserves			1
the week begins with blood tests and scans			1
then , i go home and wait seven days for the doctor to tell me whether i 'm still in remission			0
the period in between the tests and the results is the worst			1
every time my phone rings , my heart sinks			0
i wonder if it 's my oncologist calling to deliver bad news			1
are we close to beating cancer ? my mind spends a lot of time analyzing the " what if " scenarios			1
what if it comes back ? will i go through the treatment again ? what if the chemotherapy and radiation caused some other form of cancer or did it cause a genetic mutation that 's going to force me to be isolated from the human population and live in a clean room forever ? i try to run every possibility through my head			1
that way , i 'm be prepared for whatever news i 'm given			0
on the seventh day , i drive myself back to the cancer center , check in and wait for about two hours for my 15 - minute appointment			2
( my doctor has a problem with punctuality			0
) in the waiting room , i sit with many other cancer patients			2
some wear surgical masks to protect them from germs , while others are in wheelchairs			0
their situations seem far worse than mine was , so i do n't complain			0
after reading 16 magazines cover - to - cover , mostly about how to prevent cancer , and several rounds of counting the floor tiles , the nurse calls my name			2
my heart , once again , sinks because i know i 'm about to learn my fate			0
i try to play it cool and act calm , but after she takes my vital signs , my cover is blown			0
" are you nervous , mr. @entity106 ? do n't be nervous , " she says			1
that 's easy for her to say			2
she then peels the @entity110 off my arm and walks me to the examination room where i wait for the doctor			0
a few minutes later , he knocks on the door and then enters the room			0
he 's usually carrying an @entity117 and some papers			2
" good news , mr. @entity106 , " he says			1
" the tests show no evidence of disease			2
" a sense of relief comes over me and my sphincter muscles loosen			0
more lives being saved : cancer death rates drop 20 % before i leave , the doctor hands me the paper with the test results			2
i treat it like a trophy or diploma			0
i never fold the document , and i save all of them			0
before leaving , i make another appointment for next month , so i can then start the same process all over again			1
they tell me i 'll have to do this for the next five years			0
in between appointments , any cough , ache or pain forces me to wonder whether it 's cancer growing in my body			1
as a cancer survivor , it 's something i ca n't help but think of			1
as time goes on , i 'm getting better at managing the stress			0
the monthly exams are a small price to pay for staying alive			1
some are n't so lucky .			0

@entity106 was diagnosed with @entity2 's lymphoma in 2011
he *undergoes* a battery of tests each month to see whether the cancer has returned
the process causes him mental anguish , he says
but he acknowledges it 's a small price to pay for staying alive
