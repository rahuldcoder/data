@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 passed a bill thursday that would amend the health care law to bar federal funding for health plans that provide abortion services			1
the vote was 251 in favor and 170 against			0
the bill , the @entity12 , was sponsored by @entity15 @entity14 @entity13 and gathered overwhelming @entity14 support			1
only two @entity14 voted against it , along with all but 15 @entity18			1
@entity20 @entity19 condemned the bill during earlier debate , arguing that if it passed , " women can die on the floor and health care providers do not have to intervene			1
" democrats opposed to the bill charged that the @entity14 majority was ignoring the nation 's top priority and instead spending time on a bitterly divisive issue			1
" instead of focusing on jobs , republicans are continuing to wage their war on women , " @entity34 democrat @entity33 said on the @entity2 floor			0
but @entity14 leaders emphasized the @entity2 spent the bulk of the week on proposals like the three free trade agreements that passed wednesday aimed at boosting job creation			2
they explained thursday 's vote was simply following through on a campaign promise that @entity2 @entity14 made when they outlined their agenda in the run - up to the 2010 elections			2
" we 've done four or five solid job - creation bills this week and this bill was part of our pledge to @entity3			0
we are keeping our word to the @entity3 people , and we are going to do it , " house speaker @entity55 said			0
supporters of the measure argued that the health care law contains a loophole that allows those receiving federal subsidies to use the money to enroll in health care plans that allow abortion services			1
abortion rights advocates maintain the bill is unnecessary because existing laws already bar any taxpayer money from underwriting abortion procedures			2
during the health care debate , president @entity72 signed an executive order stating no federal funds could be used in the new health care exchanges created in the law			1
pro-abortion - rights groups like @entity79 also maintain the bill adds a new restriction			0
currently , hospitals that receive federal funds but do n't have facilities to treat women who may need emergency abortion services are directed to transfer those patients to a health care facility that can treat them			1
the @entity13 bill removes that requirement			0
a day after the @entity2 passed the three trade agreements with @entity92 , @entity93 , and @entity94 with sizable bipartisan votes , debate in the @entity2 chamber on the abortion bill thursday was heated and at times became personal			2
rep. @entity100 , @entity34 , who revealed last year that she suffered a miscarriage and required a procedure to end her pregnancy , accused @entity14 of being " absolutely misogynist " for bringing up the bill			2
but rep. @entity105 , @entity106 , responded , " the misogyny comes from those who promote the killing of unborn babies			0
" @entity105 said the bill was not about taking away any existing rights , but restricting the use of federal money			0
she cited opinion polls showing that more than three - quarters of @entity3 oppose taxpayer funding of abortions			0
rep. @entity118 , @entity119 , disputed @entity18 who repeatedly argued that @entity72 's 2010 executive order made it clear women would have to use private funds to pay for any abortion services			1
" it is flawed because executive orders can disappear as quickly as they are issued			0
but the @entity12 will create a solid framework that will safeguard taxpayer dollars , " @entity118 said			0
the @entity130 is not expected to take up the bill and the @entity2 issued a veto threat on the @entity12 on wednesday .			1

@entity134 passes with overwhelming @entity14 support
@entity20 @entity19 condemns measure
@entity139 would bar funding for health plans providing abortion services
@entity130 unlikely to take up measure ; @entity72 promises veto
