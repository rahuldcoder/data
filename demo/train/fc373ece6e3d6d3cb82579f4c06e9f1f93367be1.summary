an investigative report prepared by the @entity1 finds little to support questions raised about @entity4 actions on the ground in @entity6 , @entity7 , the night of a deadly 2012 attack on the @entity10 diplomatic compound			1
read the full report the final report , from chairman @entity13 , @entity14 , and ranking member rep. @entity15 , @entity16 , concludes there was no intelligence failure prior to the attack , no stand - down order to @entity4 operatives trying to go assist at the besieged consular building and found conflicting intelligence in the wake of the attack about the motive and cause , which were reflected in early public comments by the administration			1
but the investigation also found the security at the diplomatic outpost was weak and it described a " flawed " process used to create talking points for @entity1 members and then - @entity37 ambassador @entity36 , whose public statements after the attack incensed critics who said the administration was avoiding calling the attack terrorism			1
fast facts : @entity6 attack the declassified version of the report attempts to knock down other accusations about the @entity6 incident and aftermath , finding no evidence of @entity4 employees being intimidated from testifying and also no indication the @entity4 presence in @entity6 was partially to secretly ship arms from @entity7 to @entity54			2
the september 11 , 2012 , attack left @entity10 ambassador @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 dead , and immediately sparked controversy , with republicans accusing the @entity63 administration of mishandling the attack and manipulating the talking points used to discuss it for political reasons			2
the intelligence panel , along with several other @entity1 committees , spent the past two years interviewing witnesses and examining evidence about the @entity63 administration 's response to the attacks and the related controversy that has been a flashpoint between @entity61 and president @entity63 over his conduct of foreign policy			0
another @entity80 , the @entity79 on @entity6 , is conducting its own investigation			0
" @entity84 on @entity6 received the @entity86 's report on the @entity6 terrorist attack ( in august ) , and has reviewed it along with other committee reports and materials as the investigation proceeds , " spokesman @entity82 said in a statement			0
" it will aid the @entity79 's comprehensive investigation to determine the full facts of what happened in @entity6 , @entity7 before , during and after the attack and contribute toward our final , definitive accounting of the attack on behalf of @entity99			0
