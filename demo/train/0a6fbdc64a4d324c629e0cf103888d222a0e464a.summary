@entity1 a bleeding woman collapses on the ground			0
a police officer totes a weapon behind her			1
it 's an image that spread rapidly on social media -- and fueled furor among activists in @entity10 who claimed it cast light on a devastating reality , four years after protests shaped a revolution that toppled @entity10 's government			1
activists say the woman , @entity18 , was peacefully participating in a small protest commemorating the revolution in @entity1 's @entity21 on saturday when she was shot dead			1
police deny using anything but tear gas as they quelled protests			1
but @entity27 's colleagues at the @entity28 say police fired shots and killed her			1
" if there were any attempts to hold security officers accountable over the past four years , @entity18 would n't have been killed , " said @entity32 , a spokesman for the @entity33			1
@entity27 was one of at least 16 people killed in protests over the weekend at events marking the fourth anniversary of @entity10 's revolution , officials say			1
fifteen were killed sunday , including a police conscript , according to the @entity45			1
two of those killed were men trying to plant a bomb in @entity50 , ministry spokesman @entity46 said			1
it was not clear sunday night how many people had been arrested , because some were released on the spot or shortly afterward , the @entity51 said			1
eight journalists covering the sunday protests were among those detained , the @entity56 and @entity57 reported			1
meanwhile , the prosecutor general has launched an investigation into @entity27 's death and called policemen on duty that day in for questioning , along with six @entity28 members arrested at the saturday march			1
@entity69 , spokesman for the party , called @entity27 's death an assassination that " sends a message against political and partisan life			1
" four years ago on @entity76 , a national holiday celebrated january 25 , thousands of @entity10 marched to protest security violations			1
the protests quickly gained momentum as clashes with security forces left hundreds dead and culminated in the ouster of then - president @entity83			1
almost all the police officers implicated in the 2011 violence were acquitted			1
last november , a @entity1 court dismissed charges against @entity83 and acquitted his interior minister and top security aides on charges related to the protesters ' deaths			0
thousands have been killed and thousands more arrested since 2011 as local and international rights groups decried the impunity with which security forces operated			1
the toll dramatically increased in the summer of 2013 following the removal of ex-president @entity99 in the wake of another wave of mass protests			2
the crackdown on his supporters in august 2013 left at least 1,000 killed			2
many of the famous activists associated with the original january 25 demonstrations are now behind bars			2
rights groups have scaled down operations as the government announced the activation of an old law that would restrict activities and funding			0
those who marched with @entity27 on saturday chose to demonstrate the day before january 25 " so they do n't get confused or lumped with the @entity120 protests , " @entity32 said			1
@entity10 's government has said a surge in terrorist attacks have forced stricter measures , as hundreds of army and police personnel were killed in bombings and shootings			1
the @entity51 said in a statement to state media last december that it had arrested 10,000 rioters , saboteurs and terrorists in 2014 alone			2
the opposition has consistently condemned these attacks but says the regime is using terrorism as an excuse to impose more restrictions			0
on sunday , @entity10 military armored personnel carriers closed @entity21 to traffic			1
state celebrations planned to mark the day were canceled to mourn the passing of @entity147 's @entity146			2
secular political parties that now see demonstration as an ineffective and costly tool for change dissuaded youth members from protesting on the anniversary day			2
" today there 's a new phase of revolutionary work			2
the coup has to realize that the revolution has taken a new turn , " @entity120 spokesman @entity157 tweeted			2
" â€‹ sunday 's demonstrations and marches took place away from the iconic square			2
the @entity166 , which was launched to support @entity99 but has witnessed the departures of @entity169 parties and movements seeking different strategies , posted photos and videos of marches and clashes with the police in and outside @entity1			2
for @entity179 , a 47 - year - old member of the leftist @entity180 , this clampdown on political life is the battlefront			0
it was the killing of april 6 @entity184 's @entity183 during the demonstrations last january 25 that convinced @entity179 to reconsider his belief that revolutionaries should n't legitimize the regime by political participation			2
" i 'm not ready to see another kid shot			0
i had to think about changing the mechanism of the revolution			2
demonstrations and protests had to be changed to protect the youth of the revolution , so that no one else is shot dead			1
enough with blood , " he told @entity2			0
@entity179 and fellow party members have an enduring goal : maintaining a place on the political scene until emerging parties are strong enough to mount a serious challenge			0
electoral campaigning would provide a state - sanctioned framework to reach out to people , network and organize in a bid to achieve the goals that fueled the revolution , he explained			1
days before the anniversary , @entity179 was in @entity1 's @entity216 neighborhood telling potential voters about a revolution that hoped to make authorities accountable			1
" the revolution did n't give us anything , " a man told him			2
others voiced numerous concerns about security , health care , unemployment and housing			0
they had little hope that @entity179 or any elected official would bring about change			0
in a televised speech sunday , president @entity233 struck an optimistic chord			0
" the fourth anniversary represents to all of us a new flame of hope , development and action , " he said			0
" there is no doubt that there are shortcomings that exist and will take time until we all overcome them			0
with the will to work and the will to change , we will be able to overcome these shortcomings and achieve our hopes			0
" finance minister @entity254 told @entity2 late last year that the government is working on multiple fronts : battling inflation , increasing spending on education and health care , increasing the minimum wage and backing a new smart card system to deliver subsidies more efficiently			0
" so we are dealing with this while the most important thing is to rebuild confidence in the @entity10 economy to attract investors again and because we believe very much that having a job is your first line of protection against poverty and hardship , " he said			1
in addition to a megaproject developing the @entity277 , @entity10 is planning an international investment conference in march			1
in the densely populated , low - income @entity216 , @entity179 echoed the chant so popular during the revolution : " bread , freedom and social justice			1
" " when there is bread and freedom , social justice and human dignity will be achieved			0
for people , it begins with bread			0
" the debate on how to achieve these goals is still going on , with the voices that oppose contesting elections gaining momentum after @entity27 's death			1
" we ca n't imagine that elections supervised by the @entity51 , presided over by the minister killing our youth , can be fair elections , " @entity282 and @entity299 spokesman @entity298 said at a joint press conference on sunday			0
" political parties that claim to battle for democracy , social justice and a civilian system should take a unified stance , " @entity33 head @entity305 said at the press conference			0
a monday meeting will decide whether that means withdrawing from elections			0
despite the setbacks , @entity179 was hopeful			0
" the revolution did n't fail			0
the revolution is on the path typically taken by all revolutions in the world			0
revolutions do n't happen and succeed in three to four years			0
the revolution is accumulative , " he said , " and we wo n't see results before 10 or 15 years at least			0
