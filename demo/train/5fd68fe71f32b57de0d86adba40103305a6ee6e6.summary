more than 2.5 million people have watched @entity6 grow to age 10 on the video , but age progression movies are almost as old as @entity10 itself			1

another one from 2006 , " @entity27 takes a photo of himself every day for 6 years , " has a crazy 17 million views			0
what makes @entity6 's case remarkable -- and others less so -- is that you actually see her changing and growing over time in her video			1
