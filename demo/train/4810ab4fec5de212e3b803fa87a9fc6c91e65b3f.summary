if convicted of that charge , he faced a possible sentence of 30 years to life			0
@entity9 allegedly posted videos on the @entity32 showing him with weapons			1
at a court hearing the next month , a federal prosecutor took the unusual step of revealing @entity9 had been on a " no - fly " list and had been removed so he could fly from @entity38 to the @entity3 where he was arrested			1

@entity46 agents observed him during the flight although he was not taken into custody until after he arrived in the @entity3			2

the @entity46 interviewed him three times in @entity63 about his activities before he flew to the @entity3			0
