western allies vowed a tough fight against @entity2 on monday after the terrorist group called for attacks against those countries			1
" this call for the murder of civilians along with the execution of hostages and mass slaughters testifies once again , if necessary , of the terrorists ' cruelty and justifies a tireless fight , " @entity7 interior minister @entity6 said in a statement			1

ensuring the safety of our citizens is a top priority			0
our security posture will continue to respond appropriately to protect the @entity37 people , " a senior @entity56 official said			1
" these latest comments from @entity2 demonstrate once again that it remains more interested in pursuing its own violent and nihilistic goals rather than advancing any productive agenda for the people of @entity65 or @entity66			2
beyond that , we do n't intend to get in a back and forth with @entity2 , or any other terrorist group , regarding its propaganda			1
" these countries , part of the coalition taking on @entity2 , were responding to a new audio recording in which a senior @entity2 leader , for the first time , explicitly called for attacks in the @entity37 and on the home soil of @entity80 allies			1
@entity2 leader : behead @entity82 the leader specifically called for lone - wolf attacks in the @entity37 and @entity7 -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against @entity2 in @entity65			1
the @entity56 had no comment to @entity88 when asked about the message sunday night			0

both of them are disbelievers			0
both of them are considered to be waging war			0
" " @entity117 , and oh @entity118 , the @entity43 did not initiate a war against you , as your governments and media try to make you believe , " the @entity2 spokesman added			1
" it is you who started the transgression against us , and thus you deserve blame and you will pay a great price			0
" he gave specifics on how to attack @entity82 : " rig the roads with explosives for them			0
do not let them feel secure			0
@entity140 them wherever they may be			0
turn their worldly life into fear and fire			0
remove their families from their homes and thereafter blow up their homes			0
" @entity149 has called for similar attacks in the past			0
but given @entity2 ' radical support base , which believes @entity2 leaders are the rightful sovereign leaders of all @entity155 worldwide , the @entity2 pronouncement carries more weight			2
@entity7 : we are not afraid " their threats will not deter our determination to end their acts of violence and rescue persecuted populations , " @entity6 said			1
" @entity7 is not afraid " because it is " not the first time we have been threatened by terrorist groups that attack our values of tolerance , humanism , respect for human rights and democracy , " he added			2
" @entity7 is not afraid because it does not intend to give in to terrorist traps			2
it knows that unity , serenity and citizens ' vigilance is the best answer that can be enforced against them			0

the group threatens to kill the hostage in the video , which shows the captive on camera			1
" we hereby warn ( @entity7 president @entity202 ) @entity201 , the head of the criminal @entity203 , to stop attacking the @entity43 within 24 hours from this statement , otherwise your citizen will be slaughtered			2
if you want his life , you must make an official announcement to end your aggression on the @entity43			0
you are here being warned , " says a masked man			0
@entity19 : ' be confident ' the @entity19 prime minister 's office released a statement monday saying it is treating the @entity2 statement as genuine			1
" we are giving our law enforcement and security agencies the resources and legislative powers they need to keep @entity19 and @entity19 as safe as possible , " the office said			2
but it also fired back at the radical militant group			0
@entity2 " will claim that our involvement in this international effort is the reason they are targeting us , but these people do not attack us for what we do , but for who we are and how we live , " the statement said			2
" @entity19 should continue to be confident to go about their daily lives as normal			2
