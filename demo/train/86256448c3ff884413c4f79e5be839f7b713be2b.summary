-- remember the name : @entity2 is only 20 years of age , but the golfer is already being mentioned in the same breath as @entity6 after a whirlwind start to his @entity9 career			1
@entity2 , like @entity6 , was a multiple @entity10 champion before dominating college golf in his freshman year			1
quickly turning professional , he became the first teenage winner on the @entity9 in 82 years , and at this week 's traditional curtain raiser to 2014 he finished second to veteran @entity15 at the @entity16 in @entity17			1
@entity15 , the @entity15 champion , carded four birdies in seven holes to pip joint third - round leader @entity2 by a shot on monday			1
the 37 - year - old tweeted after his win : " i love underdog stories " -- a recognition of the youngster 's growing reputation			0
@entity2 is one of @entity28 's " five players to watch " in 2014 , as he seeks to add to last year 's maiden victory			1
along with three of the biggest names in the sport -- who enjoyed wildly varying fortunes last season -- we have also cast our net in the direction of @entity38 , where the emerging prodigies seem to get ever younger and ever more a threat to the established order on the @entity9			1
@entity2 starting 2013 ranked 810th in the world and having turned professional halfway through his sophomore year at the @entity44 , @entity2 ended it as the @entity9 's @entity46 and with a place on the winning @entity50 @entity49 team			1
so highly - rated was @entity2 , that his first victory on the @entity9 at the @entity52 in july was hardly considered a surprise			1
he won a three - way playoff against defending champion @entity15 and @entity55 after spectacularly holing from a greenside bunker on the final hole of regulation play to force the shootout			2
@entity2 then lost in a playoff for the @entity61 to another promising young golfer , 23 - year - old @entity62 and charged to fourth in the @entity63 with a last - round 62			1
he ended the year just outside the world 's top 20 , earning the nod from @entity67 as a captain 's pick in the @entity49			0
@entity6 was a teammate in the comfortable victory over the @entity71 , and when asked about @entity2 the world @entity72 gave the following verdict : " he 's earned his way on here and he 's played exceptional golf and his talent is going to take him a long way over the years			1
" @entity6 @entity81 may have ended 2013 as the @entity9 's @entity82 , but will want to finally lose the tag of " 14 - time major winner " and close on @entity86 's all - time record of 18			1
@entity6 has been stuck on 14 since winning the @entity87 in june 2008 with an injured knee which required surgery and a lengthy recuperation			2
his well - chronicled personal problems also clearly impacted on his career and it was only last year which saw the re-emergence of a golfer resembling the former all - conquering @entity6			2
five wins on the @entity9 were ample evidence , but in the majors his best was tied fourth at the masters and he will be focused on changing that stat. with youngsters like @entity2 emerging and veterans like arch - rival @entity105 showing no signs of fading away , @entity6 , who has just turned 38 , knows this is a big year -- and the choice of venues for the majors could be in his favor			1
" i 'm really excited about the major championships next year			0
i 've won at three of the four venues -- @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 -- and on @entity118 ( @entity87 ) , i 'm trending the right way , having finished third and second , " he told his own website			0
woods skipped the opening tournament of the year in @entity17 to spend time with his girlfriend @entity123 -- who will miss the @entity125 in @entity126 due to her own knee problem -- before beginning his own buildup to the masters in april			2
he still holds the record low total at @entity115 of 270 back in 1997 when he announced himself to the wider sporting public with a stunning victory			0
@entity133 @entity133 started 2013 as the world 's top - ranked golfer and ended it as the sixth best after a series of on and off - course problems			1
with a new management team and a new fiancee -- he announced his engagement to @entity144 tennis star @entity143 on @entity145 on @entity146 -- the popular 24 - year - old from @entity148 can enter 2014 with optimism			0
buoyed by an end - of - year victory at the @entity151 , @entity133 has renewed confidence in himself and his @entity154 equipment after a big - money switch to the sportswear manufacturer at the start of 2012 that some linked to his poor form on the course			1
" i 'm confident with my game and confident where it 's going , " @entity133 told reporters			2
" i won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013 , so i 'll try to make up for that with two this year			2
" a bold prediction , but @entity133 clearly has the talent to back up his words and has been practicing hard in @entity168 ahead of his opening tournament of the season at the @entity171 starting on january 16			2
he will lock horns with @entity6 for the first time in 2014 at the @entity174 a fortnight later -- an early marker for the rest of the year			1
@entity177 @entity177 was denied the " triple crown " back in his home country in december by @entity133 , who mounted a final round charge to win at @entity180			2
following wins at the @entity185 @entity9 and @entity129 events , it would have capped a triumphant 2013 for the 33 - year - old from @entity187 , who won his first major at @entity115			1
@entity177 also paired with @entity191 to win the @entity192 for @entity185 and , combined with an impressive victory at @entity194 , the first event of the @entity9 's @entity197 playoffs , it left him second in the world rankings behind @entity6 at year 's end			1
many believe @entity177 will reach top spot in 2014 and add to his majors haul , having shrugged off the disappointment of letting a four - shot lead slip to hand @entity205 the 2012 @entity207 crown			0
a dramatic playoff win over @entity209 of @entity210 at @entity115 sealed his place in golfing history and he was also in contention at the @entity207 and @entity50 @entity214			0
@entity177 performed strongly at @entity215 in the @entity16 , tying for sixth , to serve notice he will again be a force in 2014			0
@entity218 both the @entity9 , and in particular the women 's @entity219 , are becoming accustomed to precocious teenagers from @entity38 turning up in the @entity50 and making their mark			2
last year it was @entity225 's 14 - year - old @entity224 who had greats like @entity227 singing his praises with his performances at @entity115 -- where he made the cut -- and subsequent @entity9 events			2
in 2014 , @entity232 @entity218 has the same opportunity after emulating @entity224 and winning the @entity234			0
that booked a place for the 19 - year - year - old at the masters and also a spot at final qualifying for the @entity207			0
he is likely to grab the opportunities with both hands , having already mixed it with established professionals while still in the unpaid ranks			0
@entity247 - born @entity218 tied for second with @entity133 at the @entity249 , the week before his @entity251 win , and claimed victory in an earlier @entity254 event			0
" playing in the @entity129 has been my dream since i started playing golf , " he said			0
" this is a great honor , i have never been so excited			0
" @entity224 could not repeat his heroics of 2012 and finished back in eighth , but @entity218 was initially challenged in the final round by another young @entity225 star , @entity261 , before the 16 - year - old fell away on the back nine			0
the pedigree of the @entity234 winners is also strong			0
since 2009 , all but one winner has made the cut at the masters			0
@entity269 's @entity268 , a previous qualifier by this route , achieved the feat twice and finished third in the @entity273 last october , the opening event on the 2013 - 14 @entity9 calendar			1
@entity218 will be hoping to make a similar impression to earn sponsor invites for @entity9 events after the masters , while @entity268 has already proved he can mix it with the best while still in the amateur ranks .			0

@entity2 is considered brightest young *prospect* on @entity9
he opens 2014 by finishing second to @entity15 in @entity17
@entity6 goes into the @entity287 chasing *elusive* 15th major
