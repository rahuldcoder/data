to those who study or even practiced espionage , @entity1 spying on allies is hardly new			1
friendly nations spy on one another , if only for this reality : a friend today may not be a friend tomorrow , experts say			0
" even among friends , a lot of espionage takes place , and some of that espionage is targeted against threats to national security , " said @entity11 , international affairs professor at @entity12 and a senior fellow at the @entity14			1
" then there is more mundane day - to - day intelligence gathering , which is focusing on intelligence that would be relevant to @entity1 statecraft : who is likely to be the next foreign minister , what 's @entity31 's position on negotiations with @entity33 ? " @entity11 said			1
the mutual spying is " common knowledge " among practitioners and scholars , sometimes confirmed years later with a disclosure , @entity11 said			2
" it 's been going on for centuries , " he said			1
embassies can be an arm of such espionage			0
countries allow the missions to exchange information formally but they 're used to gather intelligence covertly , too , said @entity48 , who worked for the @entity49 for 36 years , including about 25 years in the agency 's clandestine service			2
" i think there 's a degree of hypocrisy among the @entity58 to say , ' oh , my gosh , the @entity1 are spying ! ' well , so are they , " said @entity48 , the founding executive director of the @entity52 in @entity53			1
@entity60 delegation meeting at @entity61 over @entity62 spying concerns the former spy was referring to the uproar across @entity58 in the wake of news accounts that the @entity68 has been spying on the continent : on @entity31 chancellor @entity77 's official cellphone ; on millions of @entity71 's phone calls ; and on millions of @entity73 's phone calls and its politicians and officials			1
the @entity62 also has eavesdropped on the @entity79 government and hacked the public e-mail account of former president @entity81 and his presidency 's e-mail domain that also was used by @entity85 members , according to @entity31 news magazine @entity86			2
most of the news accounts are relying on documents provided by former @entity62 contractor @entity90			0
glaring spotlight on intelligence committee " it 's the leak that keeps on giving on damage , " @entity48 said			2
" i 'm glad i 'm not in the community right now			0
it must be a nightmare			0
" he retired from the @entity49 in 1994			0
in describing the espionage among friends , @entity48 referred to a famous quote by 19th century @entity104 statesman @entity103 , or @entity103 , who stated in @entity105 : " we have no eternal allies and we have no perpetual enemies			1
our interests are eternal and perpetual , and those interests it is our duty to follow			2
" before @entity113 on tuesday , director of national intelligence @entity114 acknowledged as a " fundamental given " that the @entity1 gathers intelligence on foreign leaders			1
when asked by @entity120 chairman @entity119 whether @entity1 allies spy against @entity1 leaders , @entity114 replied : " absolutely			1
" " we do not spy on anyone except for valid foreign intelligence purposes and we only work within the law			0
now , to be sure , on occasion , we 've made mistakes -- some quite significant , " @entity114 told the @entity126 reviewing the agency 's surveillance activities			1
@entity114 has worked in intelligence services for 50 years			0
in other testimony to the committee , army gen. @entity132 , director of the @entity62 , said media outlets misinterpreted the leaked documents			0
some of the metadata on phones calls in ally countries came from those countries , and the remaining metadata was collected legally by the @entity62 , he said			0
@entity62 chief : reports @entity1 collected calls , e-mails from allies ' completely false ' historians readily cite instances of @entity1 spying on allies , including bugging of conversations in @entity152 , where the @entity154 charter was drawn up in 1945 , said @entity155 , a political science professor at @entity156 who has written about @entity1 intelligence history			1
" i have to say i 'm not very surprised , " @entity155 said of @entity1 surveillance on friends			1
' horrified by what they had learned ' during the @entity165 in 1960 , two @entity62 employees , @entity163 and @entity164 , defected to the @entity166 and publicly revealed how the @entity1 was spying on not just rivals , but allies , too			1
the @entity62 employees were like @entity90 in that they became dismayed to learn of such spying , @entity155 said			2
@entity90 is now residing in @entity171 under political asylum			0
" there was a lot in common between them and @entity90			0
they were horrified by what they learned			0
to me , they 're arrogant			0
and they wanted to do something about it , and so they released information , " @entity155 said			0
former @entity1 vice president @entity186 spoke in general terms about @entity1 spying prowess , noting how the nation enjoys " a fantastic intelligence capability worldwide against all kinds of potential issues and concerns , " especially in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
" the fact is , we do collect a lot of intelligence , without speaking about any particular target or group of targets , " @entity186 told @entity196			0
" that intelligence capability is enormously important to the @entity1 , to our conduct of foreign policy , to the defense matters , to economic matters			1
and i 'm a strong supporter of it			0
" @entity58 falls out of love with @entity211 over @entity62 spying claims on the matter of national economies , experts agreed that intelligence agencies also examine an ally 's commerce and industry			1
" if the @entity71 were to be gathering intelligence in the @entity1 , it 's not that they were anticipating an @entity1 invasion in @entity223			1
it 's to gather intelligence on @entity1 politics , maybe to do a little industrial espionage , " @entity11 said			1
" it 's standard fare for intelligence agencies to do these type of things			2
that 's why they 're there			2
that 's their raison d'etre			2
" one @entity1 analyst had a blunt message for friends in @entity58 and elsewhere			1
" i have a word of advice for @entity1 allies outraged by alleged @entity62 spying on their leaders : grow up			1
you , too , @entity71			0
also the @entity60 and the @entity154 , " blogged @entity251 in @entity252 , referring in the two latter instances to the @entity60 and @entity154			0
" does the @entity62 spy on your leaders ? probably			0
do you spy on leaders of allied states including the @entity1 ? probably			2
you just do n't have the resources or capability to spy as effectively as the @entity62 does			0
but if you did , you would			0
" ' i think that seems unseemly ' but two @entity264 senators deemed the ongoing @entity1 spying on allies wrong			1
" to me from where i sit , it does n't seem like a good idea or it does n't seem to advance diplomacy for us to be spying on our allies particularly the personal phone of the president of @entity31 for 10 years			2
i think that seems unseemly			0
that goes against having relations with your allies , " said sen. @entity275 of @entity276 , a member of the @entity277			0
sen. @entity282 of @entity283 , a member of the @entity284 , said she knew of " no justification for the administration 's collection of intelligence on the leaders of our closest allies , " such as @entity77			2
she planned to tell the @entity31 ambassador this week of " my belief that it was wrong for the @entity68 to engage in monitoring of the chancellor 's telephone calls , " she said in a statement			0
the consequences of getting caught are possibly severe			0
exacerbating allies ' outrage is a backdrop of @entity58 disappointment about the perceived lack of progress by president @entity211 's administration on closing the @entity308 terrorist detention facility and on the use of deadly drone strikes in @entity311 and elsewhere , experts say			1
the unfolding political firestorm is now " sufficiently intense to force the @entity1 to respond in more than a symbolic way , " @entity11 said			2
@entity113 and the @entity61 are expected to reform intelligence gathering , forge a new code of conduct when spying on friends , and impose greater transparency and oversight on the @entity62 , experts say			2
key @entity58 partners are expected to be part of the conversation about the new conduct code , and separately , the @entity60 could tighten its own privacy laws , restricting the sharing of certain kinds of information with the @entity1 , @entity11 said			1
what surprises historians such as @entity155 is how @entity1 public opinion now disapproves of @entity1 spying on allies			1
after the september 11 attacks , @entity1 held " a strong view that we have to do everything " in intelligence gathering , a mood that also enabled the passage of the landmark anti-terror @entity341 , @entity155 said			1
" now i think that attitude no longer prevails , " @entity155 said this week			0
" if anything surprises me , it 's that people seem to be so shocked and appalled " by the spying on friends , he said .			1

allies spying on one another has " been going on for centuries , " professor says
@entity58 are *hypocritical* about @entity1 spying on allies because they do it , too , analysts say
*ex-spy* cites famous quote on how there are no *permanent* friends or enemies -- just interests
what 's surprising is how @entity1 mood now disapproves of such spying , professor says
