-- three scientists won the @entity3 in physics on tuesday for two breakthroughs that led to two major underpinnings of the digital age -- fiber optics and digital photography , the @entity1 said			1
@entity10 , left , and @entity11 handle a charge - coupled device in 1974			0
@entity13 , a @entity14 and @entity15 citizen , won for " groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication			1
" @entity10 , a @entity26 and @entity15 citizen , and @entity11 , a @entity15 citizen , " invented the first successful imaging technology using a digital sensor , a ccd ( @entity24 )			2
" @entity13 in 1966 " made a discovery that led to a breakthrough in fiber optics			1
he carefully calculated how to transmit light over long distances via optical glass fibers , " the academy said in a press release			2
today , " optical fibers make up the circulatory system that nourishes our communication society " and " facilitate broadband communication such as the @entity40 , " the academy said			1
@entity10 and @entity11 's charge - coupled device -- invented in 1969 -- " is the digital camera 's electronic eye " and paved the way for digital photography			1
" it revolutionized photography , as light could now be captured electronically instead of on film			1
the digital form facilitates the processing and distribution of these images			0
ccd technology is also used in many medical applications , e.g. imaging the inside of the human body , both for diagnostics and for microsurgery			0
" the @entity60 are being awarded this week and next			2
the medicine award was handed out on monday			0
the prizes for chemistry and literature will be awarded wednesday and thursday			0
the @entity66 winner will be named on friday , and the award in economics will be issued on monday .			0

breakthroughs led to fiber optics , digital photography
optical fibers facilitate broadband communication such as the *internet*
scientists made it possible to capture light electronically instead of on film
