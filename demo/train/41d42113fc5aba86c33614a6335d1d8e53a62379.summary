-- @entity1 and his two wives have so many children that he sometimes gets confused and needs help to remember all of their names			2
they have 20 kids in all but would be happy to bring even more into their small family house			0
but population experts in @entity9 , where the @entity10 are from , say families like theirs are fueling a population explosion that is fast becoming the country 's most dangerous crisis			1
@entity9 's population has grown from around 33 million in 1947 to more than 180 million people in 2012 , making it the sixth most populous country in the world			1
it is also one of the world 's poorest , with 60 % of @entity9 living on just $ 2 per day , according to the @entity22			1
the majority of the population -- 70 % , according to the @entity25 -- is largely illiterate and resides in rural areas lacking the most basic services			1
with only one in five @entity9 women using modern birth control , the @entity25 estimates @entity9 will become the world 's third most populous country after @entity32 and @entity33 by 2050			1
" i consider the population problem the biggest problem of this country , " said @entity34 of @entity9 's @entity35			1
" the future is bleak because of this			0
" he admitted the government has to share the blame as not enough is done to offer effective family planning services and teach people about birth control			1
" we do n't have that much mobility , we do n't have the resources , " he said			0
" because of the political upheavals in the country and frequent changes in government ... they [ the government ] are not giving it top priority			2
" with widespread poverty , an energy crisis , woeful public services , and a bloody , resource - draining insurgency , @entity9 can ill afford to see this rapid growth continue			1
" naturally there will be epidemics , there will be wars -- there will be fights for food , water and everything , " @entity34 warned			2
" it 's a huge concern that we 're growing at one of the fastest rates in @entity79 , " said @entity71 , @entity9 country director for the @entity72 , a non-profit organization that specializes in public health research in developing countries			1
" i think it 's an ignored problem			2
we 're brushing it away and i 'm afraid we 're losing time			0
" @entity71 says many people are unable to make informed decisions because support services such as family planning are lacking			2
" the poor end up with many children because they do n't have access to right kind of information , " she said			0
" we 're doing a lot of research where women say ' we did n't want that many children , ' or they wanted to have them later but they just did n't find the services			0
" the philosophy is we 're not into controlling the number of children			0
if you can bring up a healthy family with 20 children , kudos to you			0
it 's a question of running out of resources			2
it 's when the 15th one suffers			0
" but the @entity10 children are already paying the price -- the family can only afford to send four of their offspring to school , the rest have to work to support the family			0
a lack of education is not the only challenge			0
@entity9 is a deeply conservative country , where some view birth control as un-islamic			1
" none of these methods is allowed in @entity123 , " said @entity119 , a @entity120 cleric			1
" whatever is born in the world -- animals , humans , anything living -- @entity129 is responsible for their care			2
" the process of reproduction will go on until @entity129 stops it			0
why should a @entity120 worry about the increase in population when @entity129 has taken responsibility for everyone 's care ? " culturally , many women are often confined to the marital home and deprived of the right to make important decisions such as whether to have a child			1
" women do n't always get to choose ... they require permission from their husband or even their mother - in - law , " said @entity34			0
however , other @entity120 countries with similar problems to @entity9 , including @entity151 and @entity152 , have introduced measures to curb their growing populations			1
experts say those countries started with the political will to do something and spent a lot of time and resources on family planning efforts			0
the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) says government field workers and satellite clinics are the two crucial elements in the campaign in @entity151 -- which saw its population grow from 75 million when it gained independence in 1971 , to more than 142 million currently			1
it said thousands of @entity171 centers have been upgraded nationwide , while @entity172 provide door - to - door visits giving millions of couples family planning support and sexual health education .			0

@entity9 's population has grown from around 33 million in 1947 to more than 180 million people in 2012
@entity25 estimates @entity9 will become world 's third most populous country after @entity32 and @entity33 by 2050
@entity9 suffering from widespread poverty , an energy crisis , and a bloody insurgency
other @entity120 countries in the region -- such as @entity151 -- have *successful* birth control programs
