twenty years ago , a team of researchers shared the web with the world			2
now they want to show a generation that grew up online what it was like in its earliest days			2
the @entity7 , known as @entity7 , is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the date it released , for free , the technology and software needed to run a web server			1
in honor of the anniversary , a team has been assembled to recreate a working version of the first website , a how - to guide hosted by the project 's creators			0
the organization issued a statement on april 30 , 1993 , that announced the release of that @entity2 to the public			1
@entity26 physicist @entity25 created and named the @entity2 ( also commonly called " @entity27 " for short in those days ) in 1989 at @entity7			1
originally , it was designed as a way for scientists at different universities and other institutes to share information			0
" vague , but exciting , " @entity25 's supervisor wrote on the cover of a proposal while greenlighting the project			0
see a 1993 copy of the first website by 1993 , there were roughly 400 known web servers			2
but the @entity2 accounted for only about 1 % of internet traffic			1
the rest was remote access to computer networks , e-mail and file transfers from one computer to another			0
since then it has , obviously , become a constant presence in the lives of people around the world			0
today , there are somewhere around 630 million websites			0
" there is no sector of society that has not been transformed by the invention , in a physics laboratory , of the @entity2 , " said @entity56 , @entity7 's director - general			1
" from research to business and education , the @entity2 has been reshaping the way we communicate , work , innovate and live			1
the @entity2 is a powerful example of the way that basic research benefits humankind			1
" the first website was , not surprisingly , devoted to the web project itself , describing how to use it and set up a web server			0
it was hosted on @entity78 's @entity77 computer -- the product developed at a company founded by @entity81 before he returned to @entity82			0
that computer is still at @entity7 's headquarters in @entity85 , @entity86			2
but it no longer hosts that first website			0
@entity7 's team aims to change that , restoring the earliest versions of files that were on the site as well as making it a home for stories about those formative days			1
they 'll be combing @entity7 's servers for data preserved from that time .			2

an *effort* is under way by the group that created the @entity2 to *rebuild* its first site
@entity7 researchers created the @entity2 in 1989
it was released free to the public on april 30 , 1993
researchers say they want a new generation to see what the @entity2 was like then
