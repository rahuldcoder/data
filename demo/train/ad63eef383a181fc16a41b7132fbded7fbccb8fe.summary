it took years and a good bit of detective work by art experts and scientists to unveil a painting hidden underneath @entity7 's 1901 masterpiece " @entity8			1
" using infrared technology , experts at the @entity10 in @entity11 discovered a portrait of a bearded man wearing a jacket and a bow tie , his face resting on his hand , with three rings on his fingers			1
curators and conservators there have been working with a team of experts from the @entity26 , @entity27 and the @entity28 in @entity29 to analyze the painting and try to identify the mystery man in the work			1
" this painting ' @entity8 ' is very important in ( @entity7 's ) early work			1
it 's considered an early @entity43 painting , " @entity35 , associate conservator at the @entity36 , said of the period early in the artist 's career when he produced often melancholy , mostly monochromatic paintings in @entity40			2
" to find this painting underneath -- which we think was painted in the same year , just earlier in the year and it 's completely different in style -- it gives us some insight into @entity7 's development over the course of that year			1
" @entity43 was an experimental time during which the young artist was trying to figure out his style , @entity35 explained			0
understanding more about the work that lies underneath this famed masterwork and others will help art historians learn more about @entity7 's development as a young artist			1
" it just gives us a whole other body of work to look at , " she said			0
" @entity8 " has been part of the @entity10 since 1927			2
for decades , experts have wondered whether the painting might hide another work			2
a 1954 letter from a conservator working with @entity36 , the museum 's founder , noted a difference in the texture of the paint and his suspicion that there might be a painting underneath			2
technology played a key role in uncovering the hidden portrait			1
when the painting was loaned to the @entity26 in the 1990s , the gallery x-rayed the painting , revealing an image underneath			0
it was n't until 2008 , when more advanced infrared technology was available , that the @entity36 was able to take a clearer picture , revealing the bearded mystery man			2
@entity7 's grandson raffles off painting to save ancient city " we 've had infrared technology since the ' 50s or even before , and in the ' 90s we had fairly decent infrared technology , but the technology has certain improved over the last 10 or more years , " @entity35 said			1
" the technology had improved such by 2008 that in our small lab , here with our little camera , we were able to get the image that you see			0
" the @entity100 enlisted the help of scientists and @entity7 experts who have been working since then to analyze the pigments and understand the different palettes of the painting and to confirm that it was painted by @entity7 , @entity35 said			1
the team hopes to figure out who the man was , but because the portrait was painted early in @entity7 's career , before he began keeping records , identifying the subject could be difficult			1
" this is turn of the century @entity116			0
this is presumably in @entity118 where @entity7 had the studio , and the challenges are if there 's no documentation existing to tell us -- a letter , even a drawing with an inscription -- the challenge is to find a picture , " @entity35 said			2
" i 'm not sure what other documentation exists in terms of papers letter other drawings			0
we 've enlisted the help of other art historians and art experts to help us with that			0
" @entity7 has been known to paint over his work before , possibly to save money or to paint over a work that had not sparked buyer interest			0
" it was a period in his life when he was broke and he needed to repurpose canvasses , " the @entity36 ' associate curator @entity142 explained			0
" @entity7 is an artist who worked so quickly and had so many ideas that reusing these canvasses to capture a current idea was part of his process			0
" " @entity8 " is part of a tour to @entity153 until early 2015			0
the @entity36 is planning an exhibition around " @entity8 " in 2017			0
16 artist hangouts you can still go to @entity158 can keep @entity159 portrait , jury says owner of art collection suspected to contain @entity164 loot dies @entity165 stops sale of @entity7 painting valued at $ 11.5 million			1
