the militant @entity1 group @entity0 has issued an ultimatum giving @entity3 living in northern @entity4 three days to leave the area amid a rising tide of violence there			1
a @entity0 spokesman , @entity8 , also said late sunday that @entity0 fighters are ready to confront soldiers sent to the area under a state of emergency declared in parts of four states by @entity4 president @entity15 on saturday			1
" we will confront them squarely to protect our brothers , " @entity8 said during a telephone call with local media			0
he also called on @entity21 living in southern @entity4 to " come back to the north because we have evidence they will be attacked			0
" recent weeks have seen an escalation in clashes between @entity0 and security forces in the north - eastern states of @entity29 and @entity30 , as well as attacks on churches and assassinations			1
nearly 30 people were killed on christmas day at a catholic church near the federal capital , @entity37 -- a sign that @entity0 is prepared to strike beyond its heartland			1
human rights activist @entity40 told @entity41 that the latest @entity0 threat is credible , but many @entity3 born and raised in the north have nowhere else to go			1
" the killings will continue , " he said , and @entity0 may respond to the state of emergency by taking its campaign of violence to areas not yet affected			1
@entity40 said the state of emergency and an enhanced presence of the security forces would not improve the situation , alleging that troops had already been involved in human rights abuses and had done little to reduce violence			1
@entity4 has almost equal numbers of @entity56 and @entity21 , with the south predominantly @entity56			0
@entity0 and other @entity59 groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of @entity15 , who is a @entity56			2
@entity0 ( which according to the group means " western civilization is forbidden " ) is demanding the imposition of @entity59 sharia law across @entity4			2
@entity56 leaders have demanded a stronger response to the attacks from the government and the @entity59 community			0
@entity72 , head of the @entity73 , complained last week that the response of @entity59 leaders had been " unacceptable and an abdication of their responsibilities			0
" " the @entity56 community is fast losing confidence in government 's ability to protect our rights , " @entity72 said			1
@entity85 of @entity86 , who has studied the rise of @entity0 , said that " if radical @entity59 violence on a systematic level were to take hold in @entity4 ... it could eventually drive the country into a civil war			2
" corruption , poverty and a lack of government services have helped @entity0 gain support , especially among young @entity21 out of work			2
so has a perception that the @entity59 north has been marginalized by a political establishment drawn largely from the @entity56 south			0
@entity85 says the group has been responsible for at least 45 major attacks , which have included assassinations -- frequently using gunmen on motorbikes -- and , more recently , suicide bombings beyond its northern heartland			0
beyond the security forces and @entity56 targets , it has assassinated @entity59 clerics who oppose the group , and even killed a prominent @entity0 member who had attended talks to explore a truce			2
@entity0 's presence in the city of @entity120 has made it almost ungovernable , according to analysts			1
its ability to inflict mass casualties has grown fast			1
in august , a suicide bomber struck the @entity127 building in @entity37 , killing 23 people			0
in november , some 150 people were killed in a series of bombings and shootings in @entity133 , capital of @entity30			0
the commander of @entity135 , gen. @entity136 , has suggested @entity0 may have developed links with other @entity59 jihadist groups in the region , especially @entity138			2
@entity40 agrees , and says @entity0 's leaders have established sanctuaries across the desert borders in @entity143 and @entity144 , out of reach of the @entity4 security forces			1
the former @entity148 ambassador in @entity4 , @entity147 , says that @entity0 is able to finance itself " through bank robberies and is arming itself by thefts from government armories and purchases -- there is no shortage of weapons on the market			2
" less than two months ago , president @entity15 described attacks by @entity0 as a temporary setback , which would soon be a thing of the past			0
now he appears to see the group as a lethal threat that demands the full attention of the security services			0
but since @entity167 's death , @entity0 has had no obvious leader or structure , and appears to act as loosely connected cells			1
and it is feeding on deep - seated grievances that the government seems unable to address			0
@entity85 warns that " as more and more territories become ungovernable , such as @entity120 , then @entity21 more and more will want to join @entity0 , if only because it represents the one group that can actually project power and hold out the illusion of security to the people			0

@entity0 fighters are ready to confront soldiers sent to the area , a spokesman says
human rights activist @entity40 tells @entity41 that many @entity3 have nowhere else to go
an announced state of emergency will not help , a rights activist says
@entity0 's ability to inflict mass casualties has grown *quickly*
