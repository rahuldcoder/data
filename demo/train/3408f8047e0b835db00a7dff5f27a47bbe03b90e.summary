-- @entity1 has spent billions preparing to host the @entity2 , constructing state of the art stadiums , overhauling transport links and installing anti-aircraft missiles to beef up security			0
but there is one thing organizers ca n't control : the great @entity11 weather			1
recently two titanic events of the sporting summer -- tennis at @entity15 and @entity17 's @entity11 @entity16 -- have been hit by violent storms and the persistent rain that has been stalking the @entity11 for months			1
only this week a major concert in @entity1 was canceled after a series of severe deluges rendered @entity23 unsafe for the thousands of fans who bought tickets			0
with just 15 days to go until the opening ceremony and forecasters predicting more turbulence ahead , @entity27 officials and their government partners are making contingency plans for those events that could be decimated by adverse weather			1
as well as umbrellas , a mass of red , white and blue ponchos will be on sale to keep patrons dry , yet those who have spent the most on tickets -- up to Â£ 2,012 ( $ 3,100 ) in some cases -- could well be stationed in the parts of the @entity43 that are n't fully sheltered			0
many events , such as the beach volleyball on @entity46 and the show jumping in @entity48 , are open and vulnerable to whatever the elements decide to throw at them			2
photos : @entity27 sports add variety to photographer ' diet ' the @entity55 but despite fears the july 27 - august 12 sporting extravaganza could be a washout , the @entity56 of the @entity27 and @entity57 ( @entity58 ) has stressed that combating the challenges the @entity11 's unique climate offers has featured heavily in its seven years of meticulous planning			1
" i do n't think the issue of the weather has kept anyone awake at night , " a spokesperson said			0
" we 've had several years of detailed planning and i think this comes with any major outdoor sporting event			2
you have to factor the weather into your plans , and we have done			0
" the weather in the @entity11 is what it is -- changeable			1
people organize sporting events all year round and deal with the weather , so the @entity27 is no different in that regard -- but there is planning in place if there is extreme weather so we can deal with it and the @entity57 can continue			1
" @entity58 said there was enough flexibility in the @entity57 program to reschedule events if necessary			2
the grass in @entity48 has been treated for three years to ensure it is better able to cope with any downpours that may occur during the equestrian events , @entity58 said , while the dressage arena is built on a platform to shield it from any surface water			0
in addition , there are five alternative venues for sailing , should they be required , and a team of meteorologists from the @entity106 -- the @entity11 's national weather service -- will be stationed at various locations to provide up - to - the - minute forecasts			1
@entity58 's confidence is shared by the @entity11 government , which is footing the extensive bill that comes with hosting the four - yearly showpiece			1
photos : the art of shooting the @entity27 government 's guarantee sports minister @entity118 said most venues are " reasonably weatherproof			1
" " it wo n't surprise you to learn we 've been spending quite a bit of time on this , given the way june and july have gone , " he was quoted as saying by @entity121 newspaper			0
" the @entity129 would have to rise a huge amount before the rowing is under the threat ; the mountain biking is up a mountain and if it 's a bit muddy it does n't matter ; the canoeing is an artificial venue ; the football pitches should n't be a problem			0
" there is sufficient slippage in the individual programs in various sports to cater for a certain amount of this			0
with hockey , which you ca n't play if there is a tropical monsoon going on , there is enough slippage in the program to enable you to reschedule the matches			0
" all facets within organizers ' control have been covered , @entity118 said , and he confidently predicted those attending the first @entity27 in @entity1 since 1948 would n't let the weather dampen their spirits			1
" it would be nice if the weather was perfect			0
it 's completely out of our control , " he said			0
" the @entity11 themselves are pretty stoic ; there is a long tradition of watching sport in rain macs or listening to @entity170 or whatever			1
it has rather dogged this project since we went to @entity174 ( to receive the @entity27 flame ) and it rained			1
" people who come to watch the @entity27 tend not to be born yesterday , they tend to do a bit of research			2
anyone coming to this country this year probably know they are going to get a drop of rain			0
regardless of the weather , we will have a great party			0
the fun of the party will overcome the inconvenience of the rain			0
" olympic - level security underway @entity191 's rain should the heavens open , it wo n't be the first time inclement weather has put a soggy spin on huge celebrations in the @entity198 capital , or that the famous @entity11 " stiff upper lip " has been deployed to combat depressing conditions			1
many regions of the @entity11 were officially in drought conditions in early spring , but there has been a deluge since late april			1
the @entity207 celebrations were hit by torrential rain , as the @entity209 had to brave the wet and chilly conditions during a flotilla procession down the @entity129 , albeit undercover			0
the tennis at @entity15 would n't be the same unless it was punctuated by breaks for rain , and sure enough , the weather forced organizers into a well - worn routine of rescheduling			1
the installation of a roof on @entity221 in 2009 has allowed some of the game 's biggest names to complete their matches , and came to the rescue again this year when a heavy shower adjourned the men 's singles final between @entity229 and @entity230			0
while the weather did n't interrupt the @entity11 @entity16 it did turn camping areas for the 120,000 fans who attended into a mud bath , with organizers asking those with cars to stay away from saturday 's qualifying			2
why so wet ? the reason for this particularly soggy summer , meteorologists say , is to do with the position of the all - important jet stream to the south of @entity198 , when it should usually be stationed far further north			0
it has already produced the wettest june the @entity11 has seen since records began in 1910 , with july continuing in a similar vein			1
one of the @entity106 's observation towers , next to @entity251 , the venue for the sailing events during the @entity27 , has already seen three times the average rainfall in the opening 11 days of the month			1
" the jet stream is a narrow band of fast flowing winds that run from west to east across the @entity258 and it effectively steers low pressure systems , so with it running to the south it 's steering those low pressure systems over the @entity11 , " the @entity106 's @entity261 told @entity0			2
" we 're in the @entity11 , we have great @entity11 weather and that as we know can entail lots of different weather , sometimes in the same day or even less time than that			2
" our advice to those going to the @entity27 is to keep up to date with the forecast to know whether to pack your sunscreen , a poncho or both			2
always go prepared for whatever the weather has in store			0
" though the @entity106 is reluctant to nail its colors to the mast in terms of a detailed @entity27 forecast , its website does say a lengthy spell of hot , sunny weather looks " unlikely			2
" the @entity11 obsession with the weather is well documented even when there is n't an @entity27 summer to contend with , but with the biggest event in world sport approaching , the nation 's eyes are sure to be glued to the forecast right up until the opening ceremony kicks off			1
