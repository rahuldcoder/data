-- @entity2 striker @entity1 saw his late penalty saved by @entity4 as world champions @entity5 scraped a 1 - 1 draw in @entity7 to keep their @entity9 hopes hanging by a thread			1
@entity2 players celebrate @entity1 's opening goal in the thrilling 1 - 1 draw against @entity5			1
@entity1 had earlier given @entity14 the lead only for @entity16 to level a minute later			1
the result leaves @entity5 needing to beat @entity18 in their final match to qualify , while @entity14 also have a chance to progress if they defeat @entity23 in their final match			1
@entity5 coach @entity25 made five changes to his starting line - up , following the dismal opening 3 - 0 defeat by @entity23 , with @entity32 winners @entity30 and @entity33 among those left out			2
those changes looked to be working as the @entity5 started brightly , almost breaking the deadlock in the eighth minute when @entity38 's close - range header from @entity40 's cross went just wide of the near post			1
in the 15th minute , @entity14 should have gone in front but @entity1 's left - footed strike from the edge of the area was parried away by @entity4			1
at the other end , @entity46 latched onto @entity49 's cross but his header went high over the bar			0
@entity4 was then forced to fully stretch to clear @entity53 ' free - kick towards the far post			2
@entity5 almost fell behind in the 19th minute when @entity56 's free - kick rebounded off the far post after being deflected by @entity16 , with @entity4 already beaten			1
but the @entity57 were looking more dangerous			0
both @entity38 and @entity46 headed wide from good positions , while @entity14 goalkeeper @entity59 made a fine one - handed save to deny @entity46 's header from @entity38 's corner having previously anticipated @entity63 's cross into the box			1
then , on the stroke of half - time , @entity46 appeared to have given @entity5 the lead with a header , but @entity70 referee @entity69 ruled the effort out for offside			1
disaster struck for @entity5 after the break when @entity75 's 57th back header towards @entity4 was intercepted by a determined @entity1 , who fired past the goalkeeper			1
however , it did not take long for @entity25 's men to hit back			0
@entity63 latched onto @entity38 's corner and headed towards the far post where an unmarked @entity16 fired into the back of the net			2
the goal inspired the @entity57 , who surged forward more aggressively but failed to find the finishing touch			0
in the 73rd minute , @entity49 made a vital tackle on substitute @entity85 as he threatened to break clear , while at the other end @entity59 made a spectacular save from @entity88 's flying header			0
@entity5 continued to surge forward but their efforts to clinch their first win on @entity93 soil proved no avail and they have @entity4 to thank for keeping their @entity9 hopes alive			1
with seven minutes remaining @entity16 was adjudged to have pulled down @entity97 in the area but @entity1 's well - struck penalty was superbly kept out by @entity4 with a save which saw the ball rebound off both his hand and foot before heading out for a corner			1
@entity25 felt his team were the superior side but also admitted the @entity5 were fortunate to be alive in the tournament after several refereeing decisions went against them			2
" i do n't usually speak about referees , " said @entity25			0
" but today 's refereeing was not of high quality			0
let 's just say the referee did not have the best of days			0
" i think my players interpreted the game well , with a lot of determination			0
@entity14 are a difficult team and i think my players merit praise for what they have done today			2
" considering what we have done in terms of chances and the determination we have shown on the pitch , i think @entity5 have been superior to @entity14			2
" @entity14 coach @entity129 also believed @entity5 were fortunate to clinch a point			2
" @entity5 had a lucky escape , " said @entity129			0
" maybe @entity1 was a little bit overwhelmed by @entity4 being a top - class goalkeeper			1
" but these things happen and it will not be the first time nor the last time that a player has his spot - kick saved			0
i am actually more angry about how we conceded @entity5 's equaliser than about @entity1 's penalty kick			1
" @entity129 was nevertheless satisfied with the result , which sees his team remain unbeaten in the tournament having held @entity18 to a goalless draw on monday			0
" this is a good result for the @entity2 team , " he said			0
" we have played against the world champions and against the @entity32 runners - up and we have two points			0
we still have chances to qualify			0
