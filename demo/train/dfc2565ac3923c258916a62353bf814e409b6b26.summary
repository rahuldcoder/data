-- ever imagined what it would be like to be someone else for a day ? how about for the rest of your life ? that 's the reality for the thousands who have entered the federal witness protection program since it started in 1971			1
officially called the @entity11 , it provides protection for government witnesses who are at risk due to testimony they 've given about terrorists or criminals			1
" no one knows what we do to protect witnesses , and it 's good for us , " said @entity18 , associate director for operations with the @entity20 , which oversees the vast program			1
" it 's about taking people and changing their way of life , " @entity18 added			1
" these people truly are in danger			1
" more than 18,400 men , women and children have participated in it , and not one of the 8,500 witnesses or the 9,900 family members has been harmed , according to the @entity20			1
" it 's a big feather in our cap , " @entity18 said			2
the program has made some limited information available to the public on its website : it provides 24 - hour protection to all witnesses while they are in a high - threat environment ; witnesses receive financial assistance for housing and subsistence for basic living expenses and medical care ; the program also provides for job training and employment assistance			1
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity59 , who created the program , offered insight into the inner workings of this secretive government service			1
@entity59 was an attorney in what was then the @entity66 's @entity65 and @entity67 in the 1960s when he developed the idea to protect witnesses			1
" it occurred to me that we have to have a way that if a guy is in danger because of his testimony , we have to get him out of there , and in a second , " said @entity59 , 79 , who is now retired			2
but the transition to a new life does n't always come easily , he said			2
" it takes time for them to adjust , " @entity59 said			0
" ( a witness ) not only has to deal with leaving his entire family , but he has caused his wife to leave her family ; he 's caused his children to leave their grandparents			1
they ca n't see each other			2
but the driving force is ' if i go back , i 'll be murdered			0
' " most witnesses who enter the program are not law - abiding citizens , according to @entity59			1
" ninety - five percent of them are what we call criminals , " he said			1
" not everybody is a killer or a member of the @entity104 or the mob , but there are people who are doing business with criminals			1
" they might say they were legitimate businessmen , but they would bribe people , " @entity59 said , recalling the case of an engineer who bought off a mayor			2
" he said it was n't bad because that 's how you do business in the city			1
in his mind , he was n't doing anything criminal , " @entity59 said			2
while most witnesses are familiar with the criminal justice system , their loved ones are not and often must accept being completely cut off from everyone they know			0
" you 're talking about wives , children , grandchildren -- they are the really innocent people , " @entity59 said , " they are in it for life , as far as i was concerned			0
" the program is also completely voluntary			0
while witnesses and their family members are free to return to their former identities , they do so at their own peril , @entity59 said			1
" i 've had witnesses ask me if it 's safe to go home			1
i always felt there was a risk still there , " @entity59 said , " and that if a defendant against whom they testified is dead , there may be a family member out to get revenge or somebody within his organization who wants to be a hero of some sort and kill him			0
" @entity59 recalled two instances when witnesses refused protection			1
" ( one witness ) went back to his home and turned the doorknob and it blew up			0
and there was another witness -- we tried to talk her into it			0
she refused and she was murdered			0
" @entity169 , the gangster who was the inspiration for the 1990 film " @entity172 , " opted out of the witness protection program , as did mob turncoat @entity175			1
but those witnesses ' decisions to leave the program make them the exception to the rule , @entity181 after a witness agrees to testify for the prosecution , he or she may be eligible to start receiving protection			1
@entity59 described an effective way of choosing where to relocate a witness			0
" i would say to them , ' tell me what 's your favorite place in the @entity193 ? ' " @entity59 said , " and they 'd say , ' i always wanted to go to @entity195 , ' or that they had family in @entity198 or @entity199			0
and in my mind that 's three places that they are not going			0
because when you tell me you want to go to @entity195 , i know you have told all your friends that			0
" deputy marshals take the witness and the witness ' family and move them to another area , @entity59 said			0
sometimes , they start in a hotel			0
sometimes , they are near other witnesses -- although they 'd never know it , he added			0
" in the beginning when the witnesses were moved off to another city , we 'd run into the problems you would expect -- what to do about a driver 's license , @entity226 cards , how do you get him a job , money , what happens if you need @entity231 care , what about the house he owns , the furniture , and so on			1
" witnesses get help finding a job , but they are n't always compensated			2
" the program has nothing to do with reward money , nothing			0
they get money for a period of time , and then it stops , " @entity59 said			0
" we used a formula			0
if you are a family of four in @entity248 , you would get more money than a family of four from @entity251			0
it 's based on cost of living , and it was n't based on the value of the testimony			2
" @entity59 said his work protecting witnesses put his family 's life in danger			1
" there was a threat against my wife			0
i was told that there was an individual who had my name and my wife 's name in his address book and that he had a contract from the @entity271 to kidnap my wife and learn where a particular witness was living			2
and i immediately asked for protection for my wife			0
" today 's witness protection program faces the added burdens of the digital age			1
@entity278 , @entity279 , texting and the instant access to information via the @entity282 and smartphones provide new challenges to keep the identities of witnesses a secret			2
" the modern world of technology , because there is more information out there , it 's that much more important for our people to be vigilant and for us to be vigilant , " said @entity18 of the @entity20			1
vigilance plays a role , but @entity59 suggested another factor may also play an important role			0
" luck , you have to throw in some luck , " he said			0
" you ca n't go this many years with this many witnesses without some luck in this thing			2
