-- i 've never been a fan of the cold			1
as a kid , my favorite part of skiing was the hot chocolate , and i relished blizzards for the snow days , not the snowball fights			1
so when i booked a trip to the @entity11 in northern @entity12 , my family and friends were amused -- and a bit concerned , especially when i got sick days before my flight			1
" you ca n't go to the @entity19 with a cold ! " my mother admonished			2
the hotel in northern @entity12 opens every year in early december and closes at the end of april			2
but i had good reason for wanting to sleep in a glorified freezer : as an environmental reporter , i was curious to see a place where people have turned snow and ice into a moneymaker , one that 's spawned copycats in frigid spots from @entity35 to @entity36			1
conceived by @entity37 , a river - rafting guide who wanted to lure visitors to the @entity19 north during the winter , the @entity11 started out in 1990 as nothing more than a crude igloo			1
now , it 's a fanciful ice castle that 's rebuilt every november with an unparalleled level of artistry -- which explains why each winter 16,000 guests pay hundreds of dollars a night to sleep on a slab of ice and thousands more make the trek just to tour the rooms for the day			1
the 30 most elaborate suites are the handiwork of a team of artists -- sculptors , painters , architects , even comic book illustrators -- many of whom have never worked with ice before			1
wielding chain saws and chisels , they spend weeks crafting frozen furniture while electricians install lights to provide an ethereal glow			2
this winter , @entity68 furniture maker @entity66 and @entity70 industrial designer @entity69 created a space - station room straight out of " @entity72 , " with giant carvings of the sun and moon on opposing walls and twinkling lights in the ceiling			2
@entity80 decorator @entity79 and graffiti artist @entity81 devised the getting @entity83 suite , with oversize high - heeled ice shoes beside the bed			1
twenty - nine unadorned snow caves offer a somewhat less pricey and more purist experience			2
since no hotel would be complete without a bar , the artists also sculpt a chic space where guests can warm their innards with an @entity94 , a mix of vodka , blueberry liqueur , blue curaçao syrup and elderflower juice , sipped from a cube - shaped ice glass			1
then there 's the chapel , where designs etched into the ice walls resemble stained glass			1
about 150 couples tie the knot here each year , some brides bundled in snowsuits , others dressed in white wedding gowns , their teeth chattering as they recite their vows			2
when i arrive in @entity12 , i 'm surprised to find that the guests actually spend a lot of time in a pair of heated chalets that look like life - size gingerbread houses			1
the shower and bathroom are located in the one nearest the hotel -- because , really , who wants to sit on a frozen throne ? and the other contains the restaurant , where chef @entity126 dreams up such intriguing dishes as arctic char ice cream , which has a slightly salty , smoky flavor and is much more delicious than it sounds			1
@entity131 : scale a volcano in @entity133 after my dinner , wrapped in several layers of fleece and down , i waddle out to a tepee for a folk concert by native @entity139			2
at the end of each song , the crowd responds with a uniquely @entity19 ovation : muffled mitten clapping			2
my suite has a nautical theme , with walls curved into a frozen wave and an oval bed of bluish ice set beneath a clam - shaped headboard			1
topped with a mattress and a reindeer skin , the setup looks snug			2
the temperature is a brisk 23 degrees @entity156 , and i 'm still petrified i 'll lose a finger to hypothermia , even in my head - to - toe winter wardrobe			2
i climb under the furry blanket , making sure not an inch of skin is exposed			0
then i gaze through the slits in my microfleece face mask and marvel at the stillness			0
my breath comes in shallow white puffs			0
soon , i 'm fast asleep			0
the next thing i know , a hotel attendant is standing beside me with a cup of steaming lingonberry juice -- my wake - up call			0
amazingly , i slept through the night , giving new meaning to the expression " out cold			0
" i wiggle my fingers and toes -- they 're tingly , but all there			0
then i do what any sane person would : sprint to the chalet to thaw out in the shower and sauna			1
most guests stay only one night , but i opt for a second			1
it 's not to prove my mettle ; i feel as if i 've done that			0
rather , i find my frosty alcove incredibly restful and therapeutic			0
maybe the hotel should add an ice yoga studio next ? if you go ... getting there a round - trip flight between @entity194 and @entity195 on @entity196 costs about $ 700 in midwinter ( flysas.com )			1
from @entity195 , take a 16 - hour train ride to @entity199 ( from $ 44 round trip )			0
the @entity11 is a $ 13 bus ride away			1
when to go the hotel opens every year in early december and closes at the end of april			0
you have a chance of spotting the northern lights in december and january , but those are the coldest months -- temperatures can dip to 45 below			0
what to pack think wool and fleece layers ; avoid cotton , which can trap moisture and make you colder			0
the hotel supplies boots and hats			0
for details , see icehotel.com / winter / adventure / dress			0
where to splurge do n't miss the guided hotel tour ( $ 37 per person )			0
and how about an ice - sculpting lesson ( $ 75 per person ) ? or a six - hour snowmobile safari to see moose at their winter feeding grounds ( $ 400 per person ) ? where to @entity226 the @entity11 by day , and then spend the night at @entity227 in @entity199 ( 011 - 46/980 - 68 - 180 , @entity228 , from $ 100 )			1
