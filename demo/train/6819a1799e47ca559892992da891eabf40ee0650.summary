-- his glittering cricket career may have ended in an anticlimax on monday , but @entity4 will be remembered as one of the game 's greats , according to one of his first opponents on the international stage			1
@entity4 made just eight runs as @entity12 suffered a crushing defeat by @entity14 in the third and final test in @entity16 at the venue where he made his debut in the five - day format 17 years ago			1
set an unlikely 632 to win , the home side lost by 309 runs as the tourists retained the world no. 1 ranking and became the first team to win consecutive series in @entity12 since the @entity28 in 1992 - 93			1
it is a measure of how far @entity12 's cricketing fortunes have fallen since @entity4 was named cricketer of the decade for 2000 - 09 by the respected @entity33 website , having guided his country to a record 48 test victories before standing down from the captaincy in 2011			2
he has played in a record 108 @entity15 wins overall from 168 appearances -- equaling @entity12 's highest number of caps along with @entity41 -- and is the second - highest run scorer in both the five - day and limited - overs formats			1
@entity44 , now the chief executive of the @entity45 , played against @entity4 when the batsman made his international debut in a one - day match against @entity14 in february 1995			1
" his contribution to the international game has been immense and quite rightly he will be remembered as one of the true legends of the sport , " @entity44 said of @entity4 , who ranks behind only @entity49 in @entity12 's list of batting greats and is the only player to have won the @entity45 's cricketer of the year award twice in a row			1
" he was the most successful captain in the history of test cricket and was the first player to feature in 108 test match victories			2
he also steered @entity12 to two @entity65 triumphs -- as well as playing in a third -- during which time they set a record of 34 consecutive victories : yet another record			0
" @entity4 was a team man but along the way collected many personal accolades			0
we wish him well in the next stage of his career and look forward to his ongoing involvement in the game beyond the boundary			0
" @entity4 took over from @entity41 as @entity12 's @entity15 captain in 2004 , two years after he claimed the role in the one - day team			1
however , @entity12 's dominance gradually waned and the writing was on the wall for @entity4 when he lost an @entity84 series to old rivals @entity85 for the third time in 2010 - 11 on home soil			1
he stayed on as captain for the @entity88 but stood down after a quarterfinal exit , vowing to improve his batting form			0
@entity4 scored 13,378 @entity15 runs at an average of 51.85 , compiling 41 centuries , but he made just 32 at 6.40 in his final series as he struggled to regain his past heights			2
" i have put a lot of pressure on myself to perform , it has always been about big games and big series for me , " he told reporters on monday			0
" i have n't been able to deal with it as well of late as i would like to			0
normally when those big moments come around i have been able to find something , and i have n't been able to do that for a while now			0
" @entity4 was given a standing ovation by the 7,000 crowd at the @entity108 ground , and the @entity109 performed a guard of honor as he went to the crease for his final innings			2
" he is the player i respect most , " said @entity114 captain @entity113			0
" it was a sign of respect from us for someone who has given the game so much			0
all of us will miss @entity121 as an opponent			0
" @entity12 will next start a three - test series against @entity124 in @entity4 's home state of @entity126 on december 14 -- five days before his 38th birthday .			1

former @entity12 captain @entity4 suffers big defeat in his final @entity15 appearance
the 37 - year - old scores just eight runs as home side lose series to @entity14
he is the most successful skipper in @entity15 history and cricket 's second - highest run scorer
@entity45 chief says @entity4 will be remembered as one of the legends of the game
