-- after almost three centuries at the heart of @entity5 's busy @entity4 retail district , @entity6 and @entity7 is broadening its horizons			0
the upscale @entity10 store , which is a favorite of the @entity12 , the @entity13 and the @entity14 , opened its first ever standalone store outside of the @entity10 in @entity16 last month			1
located directly opposite the @entity18 , the world 's tallest building , the sparkling new 9,400 square feet outlet aims to offer a slice of the vintage @entity5 retail experience in the @entity22			1
the new site includes all the trademark @entity25 features such as an @entity27 tea salon and ice cream parlor as well as stocking the wicker hampers and luxury food items the company is most famous for			1
but what 's the business thinking behind the move and why was @entity16 chosen as the location for @entity25 's first big foray into foreign markets ? @entity0 's @entity38 sat down with @entity25 ceo , @entity40 , to find out			1
@entity38 ( @entity41 ) : why has @entity6 and @entity7 decided to move into the region ? @entity40 ( @entity43 ) : @entity6 and @entity7 is 300 years old and over the decades the business has had to change and evolve all the time			0
so , here we are in downtown @entity16 with lots of the traditional aspects of the @entity25 's business but in a more contemporized way of presentation			1
@entity41 : would you say it 's a risk taking a very traditional brand into a modern setting without wanting to undermine the brand at the same time ? @entity43 : one of the key requisites of the strategy is that we said we must have a standalone site			0
@entity16 is an extremely important commercial center for luxury retail but we were never taking @entity25 into a shopping mall			1
we 're only here because this site is possibly the finest retail site in @entity16			1
@entity41 : do you see other safe harbors in the @entity67 ? @entity43 : i think we 'll keep everything under watch and review			2
our first priority is establishing ourselves in @entity16 in this 9,500 square foot store			1
but beyond the opening of the store , later in the year we 'll launch our website so we 'll actively develop our online strategy throughout the region			0
i do n't suppose we 'll ever be in multiple sites across the region , maybe one or two additional sites			0
@entity41 : you have a @entity22 base of customers , can you take me through what you can offer them to help you expand ? @entity43 : one of the original attractions of coming to the @entity67 was that after water the second most popular drink is tea			2
we 've been tea merchants for 300 years			0
so it 's kind of an exciting opportunity just from a tea point of view			0
tea will be at the cornerstone of the product offer and also at the restaurant			0
but beyond that the hamper business ( and ) the wicker business that @entity6 and @entity7 is most famous for across the globe ... the @entity99 ( and ) @entity16 in particular are very gifting cultures and orientated towards gifting			2
of course the wicker basket and hamper is a perfect gifting solution			0
