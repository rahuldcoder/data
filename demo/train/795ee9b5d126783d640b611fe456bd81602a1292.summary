-- @entity2 's newest crime thriller , " @entity3 , " is taking viewers to a volatile place most have only seen on the news : the @entity9 - @entity8 border			1
@entity10 goes beyond the headlines with a series that aims to give a new twist to the serial killer storyline by setting it against the backdrop of a tumultuous border town			0
named after the @entity18 that connects @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 , @entity8 , the show explores the real - world tensions along the border through the story of two detective agents -- one from the @entity9 and one from @entity8 -- who must work together to hunt down a serial killer who is terrorizing citizens on both sides			1
the series is an adaptation of a @entity34 drama called " @entity35 , " and is brought to life for the @entity9 audience by creators @entity39 ( " @entity43 , " and " @entity41 " ) and @entity40 ( " @entity41 " and " @entity42 " )			1
like " @entity35 , " " @entity3 's " pilot episode opens with a gruesome murder and a body splayed in the middle of the bridge joining both nations			1
this time , however , the murder involves an @entity9 judge with anti-immigrant ties			1
@entity19 detective @entity52 ( @entity53 ) and @entity55 state police detective @entity54 ( @entity56 ) form an unlikely pair of agents whose investigation and relationship examines the hot topic of immigration while shedding light on the varying cultural experiences of both border towns			2
the series also addresses the powerful drug cartels and rampant corruption plaguing @entity8 police			2
filmmaker @entity70 , known for his critically - acclaimed drug trafficking film " @entity72 , " directed the pilot episode and told @entity0 the drama 's authentic take on the @entity9 - @entity8 border is what sets it apart from other productions			1
for example , the series embraces dialect as an important component of the story			0
much like the real - life fluidity of language alongside the border , " @entity3 " incorporates @entity87 when set in @entity21 and adds @entity89 subtitles			1
there is even the occasional use of a mix of both languages ( aka spanglish )			0
aside from being a @entity8 national , @entity70 brought a wealth of border knowledge to the director 's chair			1
he spent close to three years interviewing criminals and researching the conflict in preparation for 2011 's " @entity72			0
" " we tried to be as honest as possible , " @entity70 said			0
" it is not about making @entity8 look good or bad , it is about what is the truth			2
many people who are ignorant of @entity8 issues are going to learn about certain realities through our show			1
" at the @entity110 ( @entity111 ) in early june , @entity56 echoed the sentiment			0
" i had a conversation with my producers and writers and that was the first thing that got me hooked on it -- the promise of it being real , " he said			0
the show 's premiere coincides with a real event currently brewing in @entity122			2
with the passage of a bill in the @entity126 earlier in the month that aims to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986 , the immigration debate re-entered the public discourse			0
crucial to the passage of the bill was an amendment to strengthen border security by adding 20,000 more border agents and 700 miles of fence along the boundary with @entity8			1
" @entity3 's " setting alongside the @entity19 - @entity21 border allows the show to seamlessly navigate between both the entertainment and political world			1
given this political relevancy and the @entity143 undertones of the drama , @entity10 took the opportunity to launch a hyper - targeted campaign in an effort to cater to the 48 million tv viewers @entity149 says identify as @entity150			0
" when we first starting thinking about the show , we knew we had a huge potential opportunity with the @entity154 audience , " @entity151 , @entity10 's senior vice president of marketing , told @entity0			0
" we understand that the @entity154 market is huge , represented by many cultures and nations of origin			0
we did our best to utilize materials that spoke in a relevant way to that audience			0
" @entity70 hopes that " @entity3 's " ability to cross multiple borders of language and culture will help spark a national debate about not only the @entity9 - @entity8 border , but the commonalities shared between the characters -- regardless of their cultural background			1
' @entity3 ' is a great bet , " @entity70 said to @entity0			2
" i hope that this show can begin a good type of controversy and a good conversation			0
" " @entity3 " premieres july 10 pm et on fx .			2
