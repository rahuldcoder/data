-- it 's going to take more than free beer , gift cards and @entity4 to convince uninsured young adults that opting out of health coverage under @entity7 is a good decision			1
recently , @entity9 , a conservative group , was down in @entity10 hosting swag - filled events at the @entity12 encouraging young people to do just that			1
but health care is too important for our generation to opt out			1
we recently met with @entity18 , who suffers from aching pain caused by endometriosis and has been putting off badly needed surgery for the past five years because she could never afford health insurance , particularly with a pre-existing condition			1
now , under @entity7 , she can afford a high quality , affordable plan and can get the treatment she needs			2
too many young adults , like @entity18 , lack health insurance			1
polls show that young people value coverage and see it as something they need , they just have not been able to afford it			2
and with fewer employers offering young workers health care benefits , the need for affordable coverage has never been greater			1
luckily , the increased competition among insurers on the health insurance marketplace as well as new tax credits are making health insurance for the young uninsured much more affordable			1
on its face , opting out of insurance under @entity7 makes no sense			1
paying for financial insecurity is dumb			0
purchasing health coverage is like buying a $ 10 umbrella when you see rain in the forecast			0
if you do n't purchase the umbrella , not only do you risk getting soaked from head to toe , you could end up ruining your new favorite pair of sneakers or @entity60 , costing you a lot more than just $ 10			0
in the same way , at some point everyone gets sick and needs health insurance coverage , even those of us who are young and seem healthy			1
@entity7 provides decent coverage we can actually afford			2
if you look at @entity71 , where @entity9 recently took its opt out campaign , competition is so strong that consumers on @entity74 will be able to choose between over 100 plans offered by seven insurance carriers			1
for example , a 27 - year - old person living in @entity71 earning $ 25,000 annually will be able to buy a plan for as little as $ 87 per month			2
the young uninsured population is largely low income ; not surprisingly , cost is their greatest impediment to getting covered			0
in @entity10 , the average uninsured 18 - to 34 - year - old earns about $ 14,659 annually			0
since premium tax credits are determined on a sliding scale based on income , most young people will pay far less because they will have access to greater subsidies			0
in fact , a recent study from the @entity93 found that nearly 7 in 10 single , uninsured young people looking to purchase coverage on the marketplace could qualify for a plan that would cost them under $ 100 a month			2
based on data from the @entity102 ' @entity101 , we estimate 605,000 currently uninsured 18 - to 34 - year - olds in @entity10 could qualify for reduced - cost coverage thanks to automatic monthly premium tax credits			0
if the state legislature agreed to expand the its @entity109 program , nearly 590,000 currently uninsured young @entity106 could be eligible for free care			1
it is true that enrollment has been slowed down by initial glitches on the health exchange website , but we have seen dramatic improvements in the site already			0
the past two weeks have seen a big uptick in enrollment			0
prior to the @entity7 's passage , too many @entity120 relied on lousy coverage not even worthy of the term insurance			1
seventy - eight percent of medical debt - related bankruptcy filers actually had insurance			0
in an effort to provide consumers with greater financial security , the @entity93 identified 10 essential health benefits that all plans on @entity74 must offer consumers			0
these benefits , like maternity and newborn care , prescription drug and mental health coverage , are particularly important to young people			1
for instance , according to a 2013 study , young people have a disproportionate need to access mental health services			2
so do n't let the opt - outers fool you into thinking that plans purchased outside the exchange will have the same level of comprehensive coverage or satisfy the mandate			0
the worst - case scenario is buying low - quality coverage that does n't cover what you need and still having to pay the individual penalty			0
young people should take the time to learn more about their new coverage options , encourage their friends to do the same , and enroll in a plan that fits their needs			2
generation y should n't gamble when it comes to their health -- especially when @entity7 makes health insurance coverage so affordable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			0

a conservative group tried to encourage young @entity106 to opt out of @entity7
@entity165 : health care is too important for @entity159 to forgo
he says in @entity71 , people can choose between over 100 competitive health plans
@entity165 : @entity7 makes health insurance affordable ; let 's not gamble our health
