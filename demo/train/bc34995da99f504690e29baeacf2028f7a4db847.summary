@entity0 -- the @entity0 nanny suspected in the killings of two children in her care began knifing herself when their mother entered the bathroom and saw the bodies in the bathtub , police said friday			1
" we believe now that the nanny began to stab herself as the woman entered the room , " police commissioner @entity11 told reporters in a revised account of thursday 's events			1
" we initially thought that had already been done but now information is coming out that she did it as the mother entered the bathroom			1
" earlier , police had said that @entity26 found nanny @entity27 , 50 , on the bathroom floor of the family 's @entity30 luxury apartment with self - inflicted wounds			1
in the tub lay the clothed bodies of two of @entity26 's children : @entity37 , who had recently celebrated his second birthday with " pinkalicious - inspired cupcakes ; " and his 6 - year - old sister , @entity40 , who had performed " beautifully in her ballet recital " in may			1
both children had been repeatedly stabbed , police said			1
@entity27 started stabbing herself in the neck with a kitchen knife , police said			1
" the charge is still to be determined , " @entity11 said			2
a mother 's greatest fear @entity26 had left the two children with the nanny , known as " @entity55 , " to take her third child , 3 - year - old @entity56 , to a swim lesson at a nearby @entity58 , @entity11 said			1
she had expected to meet the nanny at a dance class for the 6 - year - old around 5:30 p.m. when the nanny and children did n't show up , @entity26 went up to the apartment , where she found the lights were off , police said			1
@entity26 then returned to the lobby and asked a doorman whether he had seen her two other children leave with the nanny ; he had not			1
" there comes a time when she goes looking for her children and enters the bathroom and finds her 6 - year - old daughter and son stabbed to death in the tub , " @entity11 said			1
that 's when neighbors heard a scream			2
the children 's father , @entity82 , a senior vice president for @entity84 and former @entity86 executive , was en route back home from the @entity89			1
police broke the news to him at @entity92			2
" a member of the @entity84 family has suffered an unimaginable loss , " @entity93 said in a statement			1
" the sadness that we all feel for @entity82 , @entity100 and their family is without measure			1
" the nanny was taken to a hospital , where she was in critical but stable condition			1
the bodies of the two children were removed from the building on a single stretcher and taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead			1
@entity27 was heavily sedated and under police watch on friday at @entity114 , said deputy police commissioner @entity115			1
@entity11 said she was breathing with the aid of a tube and unable to talk			2
a native of the @entity120 , @entity27 had been a naturalized @entity121 citizen for 10 years			1

" we 're just grieving			2
worst nightmare anyone could ever imagine , " said grandmother @entity133 , who lives in @entity134			2
" we do n't have a clue what set her off			0
" police on thursday evening escorted from the apartment building the mother and her 3 - year - old daughter , covering them with a white sheet to shield them from photographers and gawkers			1
the mother was treated at a hospital for trauma , police said			1
less than an hour before the killings , @entity151 rode in the elevator with the nanny and the youngsters			2
" i told the little girl ' do you know how beautiful you are ? ' and she gave me the biggest smile i 've ever seen and said ' thank you , ' " @entity156 said			0
nothing seemed amiss with the nanny or the children , she said			1
later , @entity156 was back in the elevator -- heading out to run errands -- when she heard a " primal scream " from somewhere in the building			0
" it was pure terror , " she said			0
" ... it was unlike anything i 've ever heard before			0
" she is n't sure who she heard scream			0

i trust her , obviously , with my life and she 's part of our family , " @entity189 said			2
" there 's no words to describe what they 're going through			0
" on friday morning , @entity197 was pushing a stroller near the @entity200 ' apartment building			0

" i ca n't understand why ( the nanny ) would do something like that			2
" the apartment is a block west of @entity225 and four blocks south of the @entity227 , two locations popular with nannies			0
