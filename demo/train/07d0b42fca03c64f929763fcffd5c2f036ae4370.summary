@entity0 -- it 's the deal that 's been rumored since @entity3 joined @entity4 from @entity5 three years ago , and now it 's become reality			1
@entity5 is to buy @entity4 , and become a phone manufacturer ... for the second time			2
that 's right , @entity4 is n't the first phone company to be bought by @entity5			1
it bought @entity11 in 2008 , which it then used to launch the @entity13 phone			0
that effort lasted around nine months before the whole adventure got canned and the world moved on			0
this time around promises to be different			0
@entity4 , which was the number one seller of mobile phones globally in 2007 , had a tough few years before the stewardship of @entity3 slowly started to turn it around			1
watch more : @entity5 to buy @entity4 's phone business the @entity23 range , which now includes half - a - dozen handsets , is still a minnow in the smartphone world in terms of market share , but it is slowly gaining traction			1
more and more people are going @entity23			0
since its rebirth , @entity4 has over taken @entity32 in around 34 markets , according to the company , and things are looking up following the success , in relative terms , of its latest batch of @entity23 handsets			0
the race is far from won , but at least , unlike @entity32 , it is heading in the right direction			0
the deal will likely benefit @entity5 in the same way creating and making smartphones has for @entity45			1
the @entity47 - based company has for the past six years been able to make phones , market them , and sell them in its own stores			0
as retailers throughout the last century can show ( @entity52 , @entity56 's and @entity57 in the @entity58 , ) if you make and sell your own products , the margins can be higher , and the profits better			0
as the world 's austerity drive continues , every little bit helps , and @entity5 will be able to reap those rewards even more once it owns @entity4 outright			1
so what next for both parties ? well not much is likely to change in the short term , but @entity4 will more than likely move into the tablet arena a lot quicker			1
likewise , @entity5 's surface tablet is likely to be rebranded or ditched completely , in favor of something more @entity4 - flavored			1
@entity5 will license the @entity4 name for the next 10 years			2
then there is the former @entity4 ceo , @entity3			2
@entity5 's ceo @entity76 has announced that he 'll be stepping down over the next year , and @entity3 will surely have his sights firmly set on replacing him			1
@entity3 stepped down as @entity4 's ceo on monday to become the head of the company 's devices and services business			1
he will continue leading @entity4 's phones business as the devices chief at @entity5			2
whether you believe @entity4 has done well or not , @entity3 has done a fantastic job at @entity4 , and there 's very little stopping him			2
being a @entity5 employee will only help his cause			0
perhaps @entity76 was n't such a bad ceo after all , especially considering that the $ 7.2 billion price tag for @entity4 is less than the $ 8.5 billion it paid for @entity91			0
this deal has just as much , if not more potential			0
but ultimately , by buying @entity4 , @entity5 's ambition to become a hardware company is well and truly realized			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity97			0

@entity4 had a tough few years before @entity3 slowly started to turn it around , says @entity97
deal will benefit @entity5 the same way that making smartphones has for @entity45 , he says
not much will change in the short term , but surface tablet " likely to be rebranded or ditched "
@entity5 's ambition to become hardware company is well and truly realized , @entity97 says
