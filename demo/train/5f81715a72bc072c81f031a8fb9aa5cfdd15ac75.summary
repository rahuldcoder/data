-- the skies are under threat			0
not from terrorists or hardened criminals , but from everyday passengers who seem to go a little loco when the airplane leaves the tarmac			0
according to the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , there have been 28,000 reported cases of unruly passenger incidences from when the organization started recording in 2007 to 2013			1
it 's a number that , according to aviation experts , is both underrepresented and on the rise			1
unruly passengers have become enough of a disturbance to airline professionals to warrant a two - day conference dedicated to the topic			1
last week , @entity22 hosted @entity23 2014 , the second international conference on how to handle disruptive travelers			0
approximately 100 professionals -- made up mainly of airline training managers and regulators -- representing 35 different countries attended the event			1
" we 're not really sure of the number of incidents taking place , though it 's safe to assume there are about 300 to 400 per week happening on board airliners , " says @entity31 , the managing director of @entity32 , the company that organized the event			1
in addition to the passenger bad behavior in the news ( @entity41 and @entity42 's niece are two of the more high profile fliers that made headlines with their on - board antics this year ) , @entity31 notes that there are many more low - key altercations that do n't ever get reported			1
" the definition of unruly behavior can range from disobeying crew commands , to becoming verbally abusive , then escalating to becoming physically abusive , then potentially life - threatening , " says @entity31			1
" @entity10 reports there having been 8,217 unruly passenger incidents in 2013 , but this is only the tip of the iceberg			1
@entity10 's figures are based solely on a limited number of @entity10 member airlines reporting			1
most airlines are not @entity10 members and few are willing to share their incident reports			1
" starting at the airport among many of the solutions batted around by presenters at @entity23 were several that took an early - prevention approach -- namely , ones that started at the airport			2
" i see unruly behavior due to frustration and lack of information more than anything else , " notes @entity74 , a professor of science and engineering at @entity78 's @entity77			1
@entity74 gave a talk on his experience working with @entity78 regulators to devise an airport design to help alleviate the type of traveler angst that often leads to outbursts			1
" an informed passenger will take 21 minutes to get from the curb to their flight			2
for an uninformed passenger , this could take 30 to 40 minutes , " he notes			2
even simple tweaks , like introducing more frequent and clearer signage , and ensuring staff are better trained to direct passengers through the right channels , he argues , could make all the difference			2
" if a passenger has a good experience at the airport , that will continue when they board their flight			1
" better screening of passengers could also potentially help carriers avoid headaches up in the air			0
@entity113 , a research scientist at the @entity114 , has been studying behavioral screening tactics used by airport security -- usually as a means of spotting criminal activity			1
at @entity23 , she discussed how the same procedures could be used to spot potential problem passengers			2
" the main task of officers conducting behavioral security screening is to identify passengers with criminal or terroristic intentions			2
nevertheless , being responsible for the observation of passengers , officers would possibly also spot those who pose a safety risk for other reasons			0
airlines could surely profit if such information would be passed on to the crew prior to take off , " she notes			0
what would @entity137 ? ( @entity136 ? ) perhaps the biggest factor for the rise in aggressive passengers , however , is alcohol , a problem exacerbated , says @entity31 , by low - cost carriers shuttling groups to prime party destinations			2
" low - cost carriers have introduced a new breed of passenger into the sky , and i do n't think airports and airlines do enough to counter the binging culture associated with many of these passengers , " he says , pointing to the fact that in many airports , bars can open as early as 6am			0
one company that has worked to reduce on - board binging is @entity161			0
by adopting a " zero - tolerance " approach to drunk passengers -- particularly on the @entity167 - @entity166 leg , @entity161 claims it has halved passenger flare - ups			0
one particularly useful tactic has been to train crew to identify when duty - free carry - ons have bottles in them , and to store them in the overhead			0
@entity161 is also one of the few airlines to work with local police to deal with such passengers before they board			0
such collaborations , says @entity31 , are all too rare			0
" @entity181 are extremely concerned at the lack of legislation in many states to prosecute offenders			0
as a result , whilst many unruly passengers are handed over to the authorities , far too many walk free , " he says .			0

@entity10 has reported 28,000 incidents of unruly passenger behavior since 2007
experts agree the figure is *unrepresentative* , and growing
tweaks in airport design , security measures and airline policy could help address the problem
