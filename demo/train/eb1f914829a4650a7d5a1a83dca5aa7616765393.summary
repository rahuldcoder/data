@entity0 , @entity1 -- a convicted sex offender won a landmark legal ruling friday that ordered @entity5 to take down a page set up to monitor pedophiles in @entity1			1
the case was brought in @entity0 by a man who had been sentenced to six years in prison for a string of crimes against children more than two decades ago			0
he claimed he faced being attacked or burned out of his rented accommodation after his photograph and threatening comments were posted on the social networking site			0
a @entity0 high court judge friday ruled that some of the contents on the @entity5 page -- ' keeping our kids safe from @entity23 ' -- amounted to harassment of the man and risked infringing on his human rights			1
the judge said the man -- who ca n't be identified -- had already been punished for his sex offenses " in accordance with the rule of law			2
" the judge added : " he has been punished by incarceration and he is subject to substantial daily restrictions on his lifestyle			0
" @entity5 removed the man 's photograph and corresponding comments , but lawyers for the company argued in court that it was neither necessary nor proportionate to remove a page used by 4,000 people			1
the sex offender continued to seek the closing of the page and the disclosure of the identity or identities of those who set up and ran it			1
@entity5 was given 72 hours to remove the page , and it was taken down by friday afternoon			2
however , a new page with a similar name has since appeared on the site .			0
