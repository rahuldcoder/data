-- @entity1 is preparing her piano students to take part in a national competition			2
@entity1 's students will not perform in front of the judges in person , but by video conferencing			2
@entity1 teaches at @entity10 and the @entity12 national competition they will enter in march and april is only 50 miles away in @entity13			1
but the children are unable to leave @entity15 because of travel restrictions imposed by @entity17			1
@entity17 imposed an economic blockade of @entity15 when @entity19 won control of @entity15 in 2007 , to stop what it says is the transit of weaponry to be used by militants in attacks on @entity17			1
movement of people is severely limited			0
this is one of many logistical problems faced by staff and students at @entity10 , the only music school in the 360 square kilometer strip of land controlled by @entity17			1
the school was set up three years ago by the @entity37 - based @entity36 and is about to be transferred to the @entity12 @entity38 , which has branches in @entity13 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			1
@entity1 , a 38 - year - old @entity43 who has lived in @entity15 for 12 years , has taught piano at the school since it opened three years ago			1
she entered pupils into the same bi-annual competition two years ago and was pleased with their performance			1
" my piano pupils took third and fourth place in the competition , " she said			0
" we worked very hard to prepare , and both myself and the pupils were very happy			0
the @entity15 students competed by video conference against other @entity12 who were able to travel to @entity13 to compete			1
" @entity10 opened toward the end of 2008 , but within months it had been destroyed in the @entity17 invasion of @entity15			1
@entity17 launched an air and ground military assault on @entity15 in december 2008 and january 2009 in an operation against @entity19			1
@entity60 , secretary of board of the @entity36 , said : " luckily there was no - one in the building at the time			0
the academic director had salvaged as many of the instruments as he could by taking them home			0
" we decided immediately to reopen it			0
we rented new premises and managed to open again in the april ( 2009 )			0
" @entity1 said of the attack : " during the invasion i was evacuated to @entity72			2
when the building was bombed everything was destroyed			2
many instruments , such as the piano , were destroyed			2
" reopened in a new building in a different part of @entity15 , the school now has 130 students and is so oversubscribed that only 15 % of applicants are accepted			1
the school specializes in @entity84 instruments such as the kanoun , a triangular stringed instrument a little like a horizontal harp , and the oud , a pear - shaped stringed instrument similar to a lute , and also teaches @entity92 classical instruments and music theory			2
@entity60 said : " our biggest logistical challenge has been getting both instruments and teachers because of the restrictions			2
i have n't been able to go myself since 2006			0
" @entity12 are allowed in and out of @entity15 only under very exceptional conditions			1
their movement is controlled by both @entity17 's blockade of @entity15 and by the @entity19 government			1
@entity19 is considered a terrorist organization by @entity17 , the @entity104 and the @entity105			1
more from inside the @entity106 : my @entity107 , by ' greatist living ' @entity111 poet the school is being taken over by the @entity38 in march after its three - year pilot by the @entity36 to ensure it has the best possible academic program			0
the @entity36 works to develop culture and education in the @entity117 and the @entity111 world , with a particular focus on children , teachers and young artists			0
@entity123 , director of the @entity38 , said of @entity10 , " it 's an excellent school			1
the teachers have been doing a marvelous job in keeping the school going			0
there 's a lot of talent , it just needs to be nurtured			0
" it makes an incredible difference to the children and families in @entity15			1
it 's a tough place and this is the first time there 's something like this happening on a serious academic level			0
" however , he added : " our biggest worry is the access			0
last december i was allowed to go to @entity15 for the first time in 14 years , so that was a big step			1
" @entity123 said technology is vital in helping navigate the travel restrictions in place in @entity15 and the @entity150			1
" we use video conferencing for interviewing prospective teachers , auditioning and sometimes giving classes			0
" we hold a bi-annual national competition and the @entity15 students participate by video conference			1
" sometimes it can be tough because the timing is n't very accurate			0
exams are not going to be easy , but we have to use the technology as best we can , " he said			0
@entity123 said that logistical issues such as sourcing instruments and making travel arrangements take up a large proportion of the management 's time			2
" it 's a logistical nightmare , " he said			0
" we ca n't hold any of our regular concerts or festivals in @entity15			1
" when i visited @entity15 you apply and wait and hear nothing , and then suddenly you 're told you can go but it has to be tomorrow , so you drop everything and go			1
but you ca n't do that with visiting artists			0
" " getting instruments and materials into @entity15 is also a problem , but we have had great help from friends in international circles			1
" more from inside the @entity106 : film director shares sights and sounds of @entity185 's ' @entity184 ' @entity186 , a 24 - year - old @entity187 visiting piano teacher who asked for his full name not to be used is working at the school for a few months			0
he traveled into @entity15 at the @entity193 crossing from @entity194 unsure whether his visa had been approved or whether he would be let in			2
after nine hours at the border , he was finally admitted to @entity15			2
he said : " in the first week it really hit me deep			0
i was so happy to see the children enjoying themselves and proud of their work			0
" the children were hanging around the school and sharing music even when they had no classes on , and that 's a music teacher 's dream			2

@entity10 was destroyed in @entity17 invasion soon after opening three years ago
it has been *rebuilt* and is being taken over by @entity12 national music *conservatory*
