@entity0 -- the @entity2 says it has helped relocate a number of people in other countries who , it says , could be in danger because their names have appeared in diplomatic cables revealed by @entity11			1
" we are focused on people who have been identified in documents , " spokesman @entity15 said friday , " and assess whether there 's a greater risk to them of violence , imprisonment , or other , you know , serious harm , particularly in repressive societies around the world			1
" " in a small number of cases , we have assisted people in moving from where they are to -- to safer locations , " he said			1
he declined to say precisely how many people have been re-located but described it as " a handful			2
" the @entity2 refused a request from @entity11 to help redact sensitive information before the documents were released in november , saying the documents were illegally obtained and should not be published			0
@entity11 began releasing what it says are 250,000 cables in small batches to four media outlets that , in turn , did some redaction on their own before publishing their stories			2
@entity11 published the redacted documents only when the outlets -- the @entity48 , @entity50 's @entity49 , @entity52 's @entity51 and @entity54 's @entity53 -- published their stories			0
@entity15 said the @entity2 has identified " several hundred " people around the world who could be affected and it continues to pour through documents to assess their situation			1
potential targets include , @entity15 " civil society , journalists , government officials			1
" " in a few instances , we have provided assistance to individuals at risk , and we will continue to reach out to them , to monitor their situation			0
" in particular cases , @entity15 said , the @entity79 has " made it clear to governments that any adverse actions against individuals identified by @entity11 will affect , you know , future relations with those governments			1
" @entity15 denied that informing governments could reveal the identities of potential victims			1
" we make clear to governments , without discussing particular identities that , you know , if -- if they do for some reason move on individuals that may be exposed in cables , that that will be something that affects our relations			0
" " in certain cases , the people who might be identified are already well known to us and well known to specific governments			2
" the information is being compiled by a @entity2 team created in november			0
it is analyzing @entity11 documents , @entity15 said , and it is " intensively focused on this on an ongoing basis			2
" the team includes 30 to 60 staff at any given time			0
much of the team 's activity , he said , " is focused here at the @entity2			0
in some cases , the activity is focused at embassies and consulates around the world			0
