-- hot on the heels of the eight - year ban handed out to @entity3 for drugging his race horses another bombshell could be set to hit the beleaguered sport			1
trainer @entity7 , who runs the @entity8 , has admitted to a @entity10 newspaper that he is facing a ban for injecting his thoroughbreds with anabolic steroids to treat injured joints after assurances from veterinary professionals			1
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) confirmed on their official website they are investigating @entity7 , who is also based in the @entity20 town of @entity21 , and that samples taken from his yard had tested positive			1
just last week the @entity17 handed down an eight - year ban to @entity3 after 15 horses from the world famous @entity26 , owned by @entity28 , the ruler of @entity29 , were found to have been given banned drugs			1
the 37 - year - old @entity3 admitted a " catastrophic error " in administering the prohibited anabolic steroids -- ethylestranol and stanozolol -- to the animals , all of which have been banned from racing for six months			1
@entity7 told @entity39 newspaper he thinks around 100 horses have been given the same drugs at the headquarters of @entity10 flat racing and called the incident " an unpardonable misjudgement			2
" he said he had given four horses at his yard a product called @entity49 , which is used to treat joints , but was so sure of its validity he entered it into his official medical records which were then sent to the @entity17			1
" it did not cross my mind that there could be any problem with this medication , " he was quoted as saying by @entity39			0
" and , judging from the fact that the @entity17 said nothing about it when they saw my medical book , it does not seem to have crossed their minds , either			0
" @entity66 ran on 4 august , and won a couple of weeks later , so they would have known he was clearly in training at the time			0
" in the medical book , i signed that i had authorized use of the drug , and my vet had countersigned for its administration			0
@entity77 had for some time been widely used in their practice , with very beneficial results for joint injuries			0
" @entity82 runs a small stable compared to the @entity85 outfit but has had success with @entity86 and @entity87 , while his small @entity89 based operation helped @entity90 finished third in one of the country 's most prestigious fillies ' races -- the @entity95			2
the @entity17 's statement read : " in light of reports and speculation today , and because of recent events regarding horses formerly trained by @entity3 , it is felt necessary to confirm that a separate investigation is being held into a number of positive samples obtained from horses at @entity7 's yard , following a testing in training visit on 20th february			1
" while conscious of the need not to prejudice the outcome of the current inquiry , the investigation has established that the source of the positive samples was a veterinary product , licensed in the @entity117 and legally imported for use by a veterinary practice , the initial administration of which was recommended by a vet			0
" this investigation remains ongoing and a number other parties have been and will be interviewed , including representatives of the veterinary practice in question			0
one of the objectives of this investigation is to clarify the extent to which this product has been distributed and administered to horses in training			0
" immediately following the results of the testing in training , the @entity17 , in conjunction with the @entity132 , notified trainers that the product in question contains an anabolic steroid and should not be used on any horse in training			2
