-- this holiday season , the @entity2 military is trying a unique angle to get guerrillas to lay down their arms : it is creating @entity8 trees deep in the jungle in hopes the holiday spirit will tug the rebels back home			1
the first tree of " @entity8 " was decorated in the jungle of southern @entity2 , the military said			1
two units in two @entity18 helicopters dropped in on a supply path that the guerrillas are known to use and picked a 25 - meter ( 82 - foot ) tree to decorate with sparkling blue lights			2
a commercial made by the military shows the soldiers , dressed in camouflage uniforms and face paint , wrapping 2,000 lights around the branches and trunk			2
the tree was rigged with a motion sensor that will turn the lights on when someone walks by			0
a banner next to it says , " if @entity8 can come to the jungle , you too can come home			1
at @entity8 , everything is possible			1
" officials hope the gesture will be enough to lure rebels away from the jungle			1
" for us , the most important month is december , " @entity2 military spokeswoman @entity43 said			2
" many make the final decision about demobilizing this month			0
" she says that traditionally , the holiday season sees a larger number of defections as rebels reflect on the positives and negatives of their situation			1
when they were recruited , many of the rebels did not know that it would mean being isolated from their families , she added			0
the tactic is a shift from what has been an aggressive military campaign against the rebels this year			2
in september , a military raid claimed the life of the no. 2 leader in a @entity66 guerrilla group that has been at war with the @entity2 government since the 1960s			0
@entity70 , also known as @entity70 and by the nom de guerre @entity70 , was the military leader for the @entity72 , commonly called the @entity72			0
it was one of a number of military successes for the government this year			0
@entity2 president @entity77 , a former defense minister , was known for his tough line against the rebels , but he also has a softer side , an analyst said			0
during his time as defense minister , the government began using billboards and radio advertisements in areas where the rebels operate at an unprecedented level , said @entity88 , senior associate at the @entity89			0
@entity8 sounds a bit gimmicky , he said , but " rather than trying to kill all the rank - and - file guerrillas , it 's better to try to convince them to leave			2
" @entity72 leaders tell their followers that they will be killed if they turn themselves in , but the advertisements and @entity8 trees give another message , he said			1
despite the military successes this year , " the challenge is that their recruitment at the youngest levels is very easy , " @entity88 said			0
the tree decorating is probably aimed at those young recruits			0
in all , 10 jungle trees throughout the country will be decorated as part of @entity8			1
this year , 2,411 guerrillas have demobilized , including 140 during this holiday season , the military said			1
in 2009 , a total of 2,638 rebels laid down their arms .			1

" @entity8 " will decorate 10 trees in the jungle
the goal is to *persuade* rebels to demobilize by *reminding* them of holiday spirit
the military says 140 rebels have laid down their arms this holiday season
