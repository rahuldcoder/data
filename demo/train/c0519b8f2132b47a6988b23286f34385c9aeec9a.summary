" i showed them everything , " he said			2
despite @entity7 ' assurances , @entity30 and archaeologists have expressed concern that some of the nation 's priceless treasures may fall victim to looters or vandals amid unrest and uprisings fueled by what protesters see as a lack of economic opportunity , widespread poverty and pervasive corruption			1
several @entity30 told @entity0 in late january they were trying to stay on top of the situation as best they could and sift fact from rumor			2

she is an assistant professor of @entity2 art and architecture at the @entity63 , @entity64 , and host of the @entity66 's " out of @entity2			0
