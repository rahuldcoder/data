this academic year , the major lesson in @entity2 's public schools will be on the civil war			1
no , not that @entity4			0
i 'm talking about the brawl between what are usually ideological allies			0
conservative vs. conservative , liberal vs. liberal			0
on the left , the @entity14 administration , the @entity11 and secretary @entity12 are scrapping with allies in the teachers ' unions			0
on the right , pro-accountability education reformers are battling supporters of local control who think the federal government should butt out of the education business			1
this war wo n't be won or lost in boardrooms , classrooms or conference rooms but in the worlds of politics and public relations			1
you might have a powerful idea to reform the education system			1
but if you do n't spend the time , money and effort fashioning an effective communication strategy to sell it , you 're toast			1
you ca n't bring a policy paper to a @entity42 fight			0
you might think the word " common " describes the shared success that we 'd like students to have			1
if you take underperforming schools and less - demanding curricula in some states and raise them to a level where they compare to higher - performing schools in states with more demanding curriculum , you give students a " common " experience			1
for the disadvantaged , this is a good thing			1
but for those parents who are happy with the education system and content with the product , the word " common " can be terrifying			2
they worry about a one - size - fits - all process that holds back high achievers so all students in different schools and different states get the same level of education , even if the results students have in common are mediocre			1
here 's a quiz about one of the most controversial -- and poorly marketed -- stabs at education reform in recent years			2
@entity43 is ... a. a good and harmless idea that has been unfairly maligned by a small band of critics on the left and the right			1
b. a reasonable concept that has been poorly executed and terribly communicated by the elites who devised it			0
c. a nonsensical method of teaching that reeks of a big government and corporate takeover of the public schools			2
d. a gigantic " fail " that is taking on water faster than the @entity92 after the ship hit the iceberg			0
e. all of the above			0
the answer is e. wait , that does n't make sense			2
that is precisely what the opponents of @entity43 say about , for instance , its meandering method of teaching math. equations that could once be solved in two steps now take six or seven			1
the sad part is that the idea was good to begin with : develop a common curriculum that outlines what students should know at every grade level so that students attending different schools in different states get roughly the same education			1
what good does it do society to have a high school diploma in @entity118 that does n't compare to one in @entity119 ? forty - five states and the @entity121 signed on to @entity43 right out of the gate a couple of years ago , and the federal government provided grant money			1
but not long thereafter , 10 states -- including @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 -- dropped out			2
more are likely to follow			0
all of this seems familiar			0
in the 1960s and 1970s , @entity2 grappled with " new math , " a dramatic change in how math was taught in elementary schools that was prompted in part by the federal government 's desire to ratchet up teaching of math and science			2
some complained and thought traditional ways of teaching math were better			0
in the 1980s and 1990s , @entity2 were rattled again when they were introduced to " whole language " instruction as a new way of teaching students to read by encouraging them to think strategically about the meaning of words , phrases and sentences in their entirety			0
again , there were critics			0
now , here we are again : at each other 's throats over a concept that many people do n't even understand			2
there are lessons in this debacle for both sides			0
@entity43 supporters ca n't concoct a new national curriculum and then fail to effectively communicate what they did , why they did it and what effect it 's going to have on kids			1
learn to navigate it , or stay out of the arena			0
and elitism and condescension are better repellents than bug spray			0
opponents have to shelve the " look out for no. 1 " approach to education			0
@entity2 are part of a collective with public roads , public libraries , public schools			2
how other people 's kids are doing in other states is your problem , just like , one day , paying for your @entity194 and @entity195 will be theirs			1
i hope that the people behind the new curriculum have learned some humility and are ready to show us why we should listen to them			2
and i hope more states stick with the @entity43 and give it another chance .			1

@entity205 : the debate over the pros and cons of @entity43 rages on
@entity205 : the idea behind a common school curriculum for all kids makes sense
but supporters failed to convey to the public why it 's good and how effective it could be
@entity205 hopes more states stick with @entity43 and give it another chance
