-- while the @entity5 draws international visitors to its flashy five - star hotels and massive shopping malls , its neighbor to the east , @entity4 , has taken a slightly more subtle approach to developing its tourism industry			1
@entity4 is hoping that the preservation of its heritage sites and spectacular landscapes -- rather than rapid modernization of both -- will attract visitors seeking a more laid back @entity18 experience			1
the capital , @entity20 , may not have many towering glass skyscrapers , but that does n't mean that visitors to this @entity25 nation have to rough it			0
@entity4 has a wealth of luxury experiences that provide modern comforts in a unique @entity30 setting			1
the @entity31 , @entity20 @entity33 's waterfront has a charming promenade next to the city 's old @entity35 , perfect for a sunset stroll			0
the bazaar next door is small , but has narrow alleys lined with carpet and spice vendors , and is one of the most authentic in the @entity30			0
the beachfront @entity45 , just west of the old city , is one of @entity20 's best			0
built in traditional @entity4 style and with a bright white facade , its 182 rooms and high ceilings offer an atmosphere of palatial grandeur			1
the @entity31 's narrow infinity pool , which the hotel claims is the longest pool in all of @entity4 , stretches to the @entity59 and is major draw			1

@entity63 @entity64 and @entity65 may be building world - class museums like the @entity68 and the @entity69 , but @entity20 is the only city on the @entity18 with its own opera house			0
@entity4 's ruler , @entity71 , opened the @entity20 in 2011			1
the main hall seats around 1,000 and regularly stages concerts , ballets and theatrical productions			2
it has hosted international artists such as @entity78 and the @entity79			0
the beautifully constructed building itself is worth a visit even if you ca n't catch a show ; it blends traditional @entity4 design with modern acoustic technology and is one of the most recognizable sights in @entity20			1

the @entity90 no visit to @entity4 would be complete without seeing the stunning views from the top of @entity90 , located at nearly 10,000 feet ( 3,048 meters ) up in the @entity94			1
it 's just a short drive from the capital			0
@entity90 , whose name means " green mountain " in @entity100 , is covered with trees and shrubs in an otherwise mostly desert landscape			0
with its mild temperatures year - round , @entity90 is the perfect retreat for visitors looking for outdoor adventure or an off - road trek			0

@entity123 located just north of the @entity5 , the small enclave of @entity125 is one of the most geographically unique areas in @entity25			2
for centuries , only boats could access the traditional @entity4 fishing villages that dot the coastline of this mountainous peninsula			1
but a new dirt road built over the jagged cliffs now allows for land access to @entity123 , a secluded cove that has a stunning stretch of white - sand beach			0
@entity139 is also home to a @entity142 resort with more than 80 villas , many with their own private pools			2
the resort offers the region 's most unique way to get to a hotel room : parasailing from a rocky overlook 1,000 feet above			1

@entity4 sailors like the legendary @entity156 used wooden dhows to expand their @entity25 sultanate 's reach as far south as @entity160 in @entity161			1
today , the government is hoping that its maritime heritage will draw tourists to its own shores			0

@entity207 one of the most popular dishes in @entity4 is called shuwa , succulent lamb served with spice - infused rice			1
