-- when i was doing my degree in computer science in @entity6 's @entity5 10 years ago , there just were seven girls in the class			0
after four years , only four graduated and out of that number , just two of us have stayed in technical roles			0
today , my little sister 's computer science class has at least 30 % females and a smaller drop - off rate			2
all across @entity20 , the number of women entering the tech industry is improving thanks to the several nonprofit groups teaching girls how to code and the bigger availability of funds			1
as a result , more women are training to become tech professionals			1
yet , a large number of them are having to leave their jobs after a few years as they ca n't break the glass ceiling in an industry that 's still largely male - dominated			1
to address this , the @entity34 for women was created in @entity6 less than two years ago			2
but soon the organizers came under attack from some men in the wider @entity34 community , with comments like " why do you need a women only group ? " one guy 's email even said , " leave them alone , maybe they want to create apps about menstrual periods together			2
" such attitudes are widespread			0
i run the @entity53 in @entity6 and at one of our monthly events one young female computer scientist approached me and said : " they keep telling me i can not be really good at it and also be a good wife and a mother			0
" straight away , i introduced her to @entity63 , the @entity64 for @entity6 , a mother of two and an all - round success ; then i introduced her to @entity66 , the country manager of @entity67 and mother of a beautiful five - year - old			2
uphill task the problems that @entity73 women in tech face are not very different from the ones female techies in many other parts of the world also come across			1
yet , these challenges , coupled with some @entity20 - specific problems like power shortages and broadband inaccessibility , create an uphill task for women wanting to enter the industry and develop the high - level technical skills required in order to progress			1
yet , i know there is progress , and the examples are many -- female tech entrepreneurs like @entity91 ( @entity92 ) , @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , @entity95 ( @entity96 ) , and myself are all running their own tech enterprises and succeeding at it			2
read this : 5 reasons tech world needs more geek girls pan-african women in @entity96 meet up up until now , no one had attempted to build a pan-african women in @entity96 network that would allow us to compare our challenges , learn from each other and connect across borders to expand our influence			1
that lack is what motivated myself , @entity112 from @entity113 , @entity114 from @entity115 , @entity116 from @entity20 and @entity117 from @entity118 to organize in early august the first women in @entity122 meet up			1
more than 150 women signed up to the event that was supposed to happen online via @entity34 hangout on august 2			1
yet , bad internet connection and technical challenges marred the event and made it difficult for the participants to communicate			0
but while we were trying to fix the technical challenges we noticed something interesting happening on the event 's page : the women had already started introducing themselves and talking to each other			2
we saw how big the desire was to network and to share knowledge that we quickly decided to move the discussion to @entity141 and start a live chat			0
the need to connect , to learn and to share was greater than any technical challenge			0
in the end , the @entity141 conversation with the hashtag # @entity147 had the reach of 74,502 and 195,209 impressions on @entity141 connecting female technologists all over @entity20 ably supported by one of our speakers @entity155			0
here are some of the highlights of the discussion			0
looking back into history and comparing it to today we know technology is not just a man 's world			0
it is imperative that @entity73 women take advantage of this to provide a sustainable environment that would encourage and promote technology amongst women			1
so of course we will run the event again , this time with the lessons we learned and maybe strong sponsorships to help us succeed			0
read this : 5 reasons tech world needs more geek girls the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

the first women in @entity122 meet up took place online in august 2
organizer @entity182 says more @entity73 women are entering the tech industry
many of them , however , leave their jobs as industry remains male - dominated
