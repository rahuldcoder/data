@entity1 despite calling the case " incredible " and the newly discovered evidence " very intriguing , " a judge friday ruled against overturning the conviction of a onetime wealthy businessman who 's been sitting in prison for 27 years for the killing of two people inside a downtown @entity1 hotel			1
@entity11 , 75 , was not in court when judge @entity13 said , " this court fully weighed the materiality , relevance and inconsistencies of the newly discovered evidence , and concludes that such evidence falls dramatically short of establishing that the murders were committed by anyone other than mr. @entity11			1
" the convicted killer 's family sat in the front row of the courtroom , and held each other as the judge uttered those words			2
just a couple of rows behind them , the wife and mother of the victims , @entity31 and @entity32 , shed tears of happiness			0
@entity11 's attorneys have 30 days to appeal the decision			1
they did not say whether they would do so			0
from luxury living to prison bars it was october 1986 , when police arrested @entity11 -- an international food importer and newspaper owner -- in the shooting deaths of his business partners , @entity47 and his 23 - year - old son			1
at the time , the @entity50 citizen was living the good life in @entity52			2
he had owned luxury cars and horses that raced against thoroughbreds held by @entity56 that all came crumbling down			0
despite having an alibi , @entity11 was charged with murdering the @entity58 because they allegedly had cheated him out of more than $ 400,000			2
he was found guilty and sentenced to death -- a penalty that was later reduced to life in prison			0
then , in april 2014 , judge @entity13 , of @entity52 's 11th @entity65 , granted @entity11 a chance that could open the door to freedom			1
a hearing was held in november to determine whether new evidence from @entity11 's lawyers " undermines confidence in the verdict , " according to court documents			1
defense attorneys also had to establish that the new " evidence would probably produce an acquittal or less severe sentence on retrial			0
" a cartel connection ? @entity11 's lawyers said evidence suggested the murders were committed by former members of @entity86 's infamous @entity85 drug cartel			1
in the late 1970s and early ' 80s , @entity86 cashed in on the exploding popularity of cocaine in the @entity89 , said reporter @entity90 , author of " @entity91			2
" @entity11 : i was framed for murders ordered by @entity86 leader of the @entity95 , @entity86 was responsible at one point for almost 80 % of @entity85 's cocaine exports , making him the seventh richest man in the world , @entity90 told @entity2			1
@entity86 was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993			1
according to a motion filed last year by @entity11 's attorneys , a " @entity85 drug cartel member confirmed that the @entity104 murders were committed at the behest of @entity86			1
" " the @entity108 were laundering money for the @entity85 cartels , " the defense motion said			0
" this is what precipitated their murders			0
" an ex-cartel member confirmed that " @entity11 was not involved in the murders of the @entity108 , and that they had to be eliminated because they had lost @entity85 drug money , " according to the defense motion			1
" we 've got several @entity85 cartel people to say , ' we did the murders , ' " @entity11 defense attorney @entity120 told @entity2 on the phone last june			0
the defense team also alleged @entity52 prosecutors covered up evidence in the 1987 trial that could have proved @entity11 's innocence			1
the prosecution 's case although prosecutors said they stood by the decades - old case , in a june email to @entity2 , a state attorney spokesman wrote , " now that we are re-engaged in litigation on this matter , it would be inappropriate for us to be commenting at this time			1
" but , in their own motion , prosecutors wrote , " the only thing that is obvious to anyone who really looks at these fantastical allegations by the defendant is that they are empty and have no substance			0
" " none of [ the potential witnesses named in the defense motion ] have any first hand knowledge , provide no admissible testimony or evidence and only attempt to further the nonsensical and wholly speculative theories of the defense , " the prosecution document said			0
the evidence against @entity11 was significant			2
police found his fingerprints in the guest room at @entity1 's @entity159 where the shootings occurred			2
@entity11 said he was there for a meeting , but departed before the @entity58 were killed			2

@entity11 : then and now @entity11 told @entity2 's " @entity171 " that he left the hotel and drove 25 miles to @entity167 to have lunch with one of his newspaper employees			1
the employee signed an affidavit as an alibi witness			0
the restaurant manager , @entity175 , told " death row stories , " he remembered seeing @entity11 having lunch that day			0
" it does n't seem like there 's any way possible that he could have killed people at 12 o'clock and then been in for lunch sometime between 12 and 2 , " @entity175 said			0
five other witnesses came forward saying @entity11 was with them on the day of the murders , " @entity171 " reported			0
