my first foray into deep water brings me face to face with some of the islands ' most ebullient locals			1
as shoals of slim surgeonfish , parrotfish and clownfish wind between the gray rocks and drift in the current , they suddenly appear -- six @entity13 sea lions -- fat sleek bullets that zoom right up to my mask , upside down and mouths open , before twisting away at the last minute			1
clambering back into the @entity18 dinghy -- or panga , as they 're known in the @entity21 -- for the short return trip to the @entity23 , one fellow " explorer " quizzes our accompanying naturalist			0
" oh , they wo n't bite you , " he reassures us			0
less reassuringly , he adds : " maybe			0
" all the animals throughout the @entity34 , more than 3,000 square miles of islands and islets 600 miles off @entity32 's mainland , are unperturbed by our presence			1
as there are no big predators -- or people -- on most of the islands the animals show no fear			1
and because many species are endemic to the @entity13 or even one of its 13 main islands , there 's literally nowhere else in the world that you can have this kind of encounter			1
sailing for science i 'm aboard the conservation - focused , naturalist - led @entity52 - @entity23 , a ship that lets passengers connect with life both above and below the waves through kayak and @entity18 excursions			1
unbelievably , the uninhabited islands are much as @entity61 experienced them in 1885			2
@entity63 , the second island on which @entity61 landed , still has a " post office " that dates back to whaling days when crews would leave mail in a rum barrel			0
people still leave postcards here to be hand delivered by future visitors ( those i addressed to the @entity76 arrived within two weeks via hands unknown )			0
" it 's a land left untamed ... one of the last parts of the world that 's really wild , " says fellow passenger @entity79 , an investments portfolio manager from @entity80			2
@entity85 recaps and talks by eminent scientists give cruises their characteristic research - meets - education feel			2
voyages also have a strong photography slant , with most on - board naturalists certified as photo instructors by @entity23			2
on @entity94 , we boulder - hop along rough trails to reach an albatross nesting site , often stepping over groups of inky charcoal black marine iguanas			1
@entity100 's rough , lunar landscape seems inhospitable but teems with seabirds , including half a million red footed boobies -- the largest population in the world			1
walking through prickly pear trees along a sandy path to @entity109 's aptly named " @entity108 , " ( @entity105 ) we spot 28 dusty - yellow - brown @entity13 land iguanas			1
during that afternoon 's ride to the eastern shore of @entity109 , dubbed " @entity115 " for its scenic beauty , naturalist @entity111 doles out photo tips in time for us to snap a great blue heron feeding its gulping chick			1
" i love these cruises because there 's always one special thing for everybody , " says @entity111			2
" this for me was the most special thing this time -- the heron feeding its chick			0
i have never seen that before			0
" exploration highlights exploring the @entity129 -- the second largest in the world at more than 50 square miles -- is as integral to the expedition experience as the guided hikes across the islands			1
on one of the daily snorkel expeditions i spot octopi , manta rays and a solitary @entity13 penguin , puffed up as if to officiate , on various excursions			1
although the @entity143 -- named for @entity145 's former command -- does n't offer scuba diving , single - day excursions can be arranged with a local operator ; it 's also the only ship cruising the park with an underwater specialist and a remotely operated vehicle on board			1
while tourism to the region has tripled in the last 20 years -- just over 200,000 people visited the @entity13 last year -- visitors cruising the islands with responsible operators are helping to correct the damage caused by over hunting and species introduced by sailors , whalers and pirates			1
sixty percent of each visitor 's $ 100 entrance fee goes directly to the @entity34 , funding rangers , naturalists and conservation work			1
expedition leader @entity170 says only 84 ships have been allowed in the national park since she began working there in 1997 , of which only four are similar in size to the 96 - passenger @entity143			2
there are strictly enforced park rules -- all visitors must be accompanied by a naturalist and vice versa , with no more than 16 people at any one time -- @entity184 also schedules itineraries and landings for every ship to reduce pressure on the islands			1
the downside of such regimentation is there 's no lingering			2
the upshot is never seeing another ship or any other " explorers			2
" with an ever - growing influx of tourist dollars comes more domestic migration to the @entity13			1
@entity170 says poorly controlled growth in the inhabited areas and other types of non-cruise tourism are what need attention , rather than the national park area			0
" i think 55 % of visitors now do the [ island hopping ] kind of tourism versus 45 % that come to the ships to spend the night , like [ on the @entity143 ]			0
" but even more are going to the towns that have grown in a disorganized way , " she adds			0
tortoise breeding hearing the story of @entity217 , the last known of the @entity219 tortoises and the symbol of the @entity13 ( he died at the @entity221 on @entity109 in 2012 ) brings home the importance of the conservation controls			1
although @entity217 's caretakers are still watching his two female companions in the hope that they might yet lay eggs -- female tortoises can store viable sperm in their bodies for up to three years before fertilizing themselves -- the species is now believed to be extinct			1
but many initiatives at the @entity61 facility have been a success , including a project to revive @entity94 's dwindling tortoise population using " @entity237 , an especially virile @entity94 tortoise returned to the @entity13 from @entity238			1
" eighty percent of the center 's hatchlings -- so anywhere from 70 to 150 hatchlings a year -- come from @entity246 and his five girlfriends , " naturalist @entity239 tells me , with a wink			2
@entity109 is also a great place to see giant tortoises in their natural habitat			0
after a quick stop at a local sugar cane mill -- and a warming tot of the local moonshine -- we arrive at a highland farm , pull on rubber boots and stride off into orchards full of wild tortoises , flattening bushes and bulldozing saplings as they move from one juicy cluster of leaves to the next			0
@entity265 eyesight and hearing is not their strong suit -- smell is a giant tortoise 's best sense -- so we approach from behind to pose for surreptitious photos as they continue their methodic chomping			2
it 's only when we pass a tortoise close to the path that he notices us and retreats into his shell with a long , deflationary hiss			0
" today we are very lucky to see 11 tortoises -- sometimes there are n't any up here , " says naturalist @entity281			0
" it takes them three months to come up to the highlands to mate and three months to go back to the lowlands to give birth			0
these guys are smart -- they 're waiting up here for the females to come back			0
" for me , seeing these huge hulking carapaces thriving once again in their natural habitat , is one of the most memorable encounters of the trip			0
" conservation is a big theme and every day we talk about results here , results there ... i think it gives hope to people to restore other places , " says expedition leader @entity170			0
" we have a saying -- if you can make it here , you can make it anywhere			0
" @entity313 operates 10 - day expeditions ( a seven - day cruise + transfers ) aboard @entity23 and @entity317 departing @entity318 and @entity319 , year - round			0
cruises are priced from $ 5,490 per person based on double occupancy , exclusive of international flights and internal flights to @entity21 ; +1 212 261 9000 .			0

blue - footed boobies , @entity13 penguins and marine iguanas are some of the species only found in the @entity13
the @entity34 is over 3,000 square miles of islands and islets located 600 miles off @entity32 's mainland
@entity184 designs the itinerary and scheduled landings for every ship to reduce pressure on the islands
