-- @entity1 is one of today 's best and most reasoned conservative political voices , so his recent @entity0 op - ed on marijuana policy was just a little disappointing			1
not because he advocates the drug 's decriminalization -- he rightly thinks locking people up or arresting them for casual use is a bad idea -- but because he opposes its legalization for adults			1
i agree with much of what he says about pot 's potential harm , especially for the young and the psychiatrically ill. like @entity18 , i am a father who worries about my kids getting sidetracked by cannabis before their brains have a chance to develop			1
but i am also a physician who understands that the negative legal consequences of marijuana use are far worse than the medical consequences			2
@entity1 would reduce the punishment for marijuana use for adults but nominally maintain its illegality in order to send a message to young people that pot is a " bad choice , " as if breaking the rules was n't as much an incentive as a deterrent for adolescents			1
kids are smart enough to recognize and dismiss a " because i said so " argument when they see one			0
by trying to hide marijuana from innately curious young people , we have elevated its status to that of a forbidden fruit			1
i believe a better approach is to bring pot into the open , make it legal for people over the age of 21 , and educate children from a young age about the actual dangers of its recreational use			1
opinion : @entity61 a trillion - dollar failure throughout my career as a clinical psychiatrist , i have seen lives ruined by drugs like cocaine , painkillers and alcohol			1
i have also borne witness to the devastation brought upon cannabis users -- almost never by abuse of the drug , but by a justice system that chooses a sledgehammer to kill a weed			0
alcohol , tobacco , marijuana , caffeine and refined sugar are among the most commonly used , potentially habit - forming recreational substances			1
all are best left out of our daily diets			0
only marijuana is illegal , though alcohol and tobacco are clearly more harmful			1
in several respects , even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation 's health than pot. i agree with @entity18 that chronic use of cannabis correlates with mood changes and low motivation , especially when started in adolescence			2
in individuals with psychosis , it may trigger or worsen their symptoms			0
but these dangers are far surpassed by the perils of alcohol , which is associated with pancreatitis , gastritis , cirrhosis , permanent dementia , physiological dependence and fatal withdrawal			0
in healthy but reckless teens and young adults , it is frighteningly easy to consume a lethal dose of alcohol , but it is essentially impossible to do so with marijuana			1
further , alcohol causes severe impairment of judgment , which results in violence , risky sexual behavior and more use of hard drugs			2
those who believe cannabis to be a gateway to opioids and other highly dangerous drugs fail to appreciate that the illegal purchase of marijuana exposes consumers to dealers who push the hard stuff			1
given marijuana 's popularity in this country , the consumption of more dangerous drugs could actually decrease if pot were purchased at a liquor store rather than on the street corner where heroin and crack are sold			1
opinion : legalize pot ? no , reform laws there is another more pressing reason to legalize and regulate marijuana , even for the sake of our children : the potential for adulteration of black - market cannabis and the substitution of even more dangerous copycat compounds			1
much like @entity166 - era fatalities from bad moonshine , harmful synthetic marijuana substitutes are proliferating , with street names like @entity169 and @entity169			2
the @entity170 struggles to combat these compounds by outlawing them , but i see no decrease in their popularity among my patients			0
natural marijuana poses much less danger than synthetic cannabinoids -- legal or otherwise			2
so who had the bright idea of banning cannabis in the first place ? was it physicians ? social service organizations ? no. the credit goes to the @entity188 , which in 1937 pushed through laws ending the growth , trade and consumption of all forms of cannabis , including the inert but commercially useful hemp plant			0
@entity197 's ban on the so - called " @entity198 " was based on bad science and fabricated stories of violence perpetrated under the influence			0
the madness of cannabis can be ascribed not so much to its users , but to those who sought to criminalize the drug so soon after the monumental failure of alcohol prohibition			2
that 's not to say our marijuana laws have failed to change drug use in @entity197			2
cannabis is more widely used today than at any time before its prohibition , even though it was domesticated in antiquity and has been cultivated ever since			0
pot prohibition has also greatly increased illegal activity and violence			0
otherwise law - abiding private users became criminals , and criminals became rich through the untaxed , bloody and highly lucrative illicit drug trade			0
opinion : the end of the war on marijuana but @entity197 can fix this mess through marijuana legalization			0
@entity188 , state and local governments can regulate the cannabis trade as they do with alcohol and tobacco -- monitoring the production process for safety and purity , controlling where it is sold , taxing all aspects of marijuana production and consumption , and redirecting resources from punishment to prevention			1
forget the antiquated dogma and judge pot prohibition on its own merits			0
if you still believe that cannabis should be illegal , then you must logically support the criminalization of alcohol and tobacco , with vigorous prosecution and even imprisonment of producers and consumers			2
does that sound ridiculous ? then you must conclude that the only rational approach to cannabis is to legalize , regulate and tax it			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			0

@entity262 *disputes* @entity0 op - ed by @entity1 that argues pot should be illegal
@entity262 treats drug abusers and agrees with @entity18 that young people should avoid marijuana
drug should be legal for adults and sold like alcohol , with kids *taught* the risks , he says
@entity262 : if pot is illegal , then dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco should be , too
