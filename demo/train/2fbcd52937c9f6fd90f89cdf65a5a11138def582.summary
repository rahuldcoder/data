-- it 's been a month since the " cease - fire " was due to come into effect in @entity4 as the first step in a @entity7 - backed peace plan , with a team of @entity7 monitors on the ground to observe the progress			1
but clearly , there is no let - up in the violence			1
@entity15 reports spill in of bombings , shootings , explosions and more as opposition groups and the regime forces of president @entity22 battle for more than a year			0
so , where does the @entity4 conflict stand now ? first , it 's very difficult to get a clear picture of the extent of the violence in @entity4 , who 's perpetrating it and where			1
the international media 's access is very limited , and the @entity7 observer mission -- still not at full strength -- is unable to monitor all hot spots			1
but there is certainly no cease - fire ; opposition groups report daily attacks by regime forces , which continue to use indiscriminate artillery fire			1
the @entity43 - based @entity42 says 60 people were killed in the first three days of last week			2
@entity7 peacekeeping chief @entity45 told the @entity46 last week that there has been a shift in the military 's tactics , according to diplomats , with a decline in the use of heavy weapons and large - scale operations			1
but there have been widespread arrests recently			0
the special @entity7 - @entity59 envoy , @entity58 , echoed that view			1
diplomats say he expressed concern that arrests and torture were increasing and that government forces " continue to press against the population			0
" observer on @entity4 ' stories : ' they burned my heart ' the @entity4 security forces finally broke the back of popular resistance in the @entity75 district of @entity76 early in march , but killings continue in the city			1
there 's also been substantial bloodshed in @entity81 since then , where an uprising in 1982 was savagely put down by the current president 's father			2
in @entity87 province in the northwest , the resistance remains strong			0
journalists have reported burned - out tanks near the provincial capital , which is ringed by checkpoints			2
soldiers do n't enter some towns for fear of ambush			0
elements of the @entity98 appear to be able to operate in mountainous areas near the @entity101 border			0
their aim is to turn it into a " government - free zone			2
" in the south , where it all started more than a year ago , there are daily reports of security forces opening fire and using artillery against what the regime deems to be opposition neighborhoods			2
what has really changed in the past few months , starting in @entity117 in january , is the emergence of a bombing campaign against key government installations			2
on thursday , the deadliest bomb attacks yet killed at least 55 people , according to the @entity124 , wounded nearly 400 and caused widespread devastation in the @entity127 neighborhood of @entity117			0
a bomb also exploded near a @entity7 observer convoy in southern @entity4 last week			1
the @entity4 @entity124 blamed " terrorist suicide attacks " for the carnage and says most of the victims are civilians			1
it does seem that jihadist cells are emerging in @entity4			1
one calls itself the @entity137 and provided video evidence of a suicide attack carried out in @entity117 in january			0
it also claimed responsibility for a bombing in @entity117 last week			0
some of its claims can not be substantiated , but @entity146 officials have expressed anxiety about a growing jihadist element in the resistance			0
most @entity4 protesters have little sympathy for @entity153 militancy and have begun waving posters insisting there is no @entity156 in their midst			1
the opposition @entity158 alleges the regime itself is staging such attacks to paint the resistance as terrorists and is itself in league with @entity156			0
is @entity22 shooting himself in the foot ? of particular concern to the regime is the recent spate of protests and bomb attacks in @entity169 , the commercial heart of @entity4 , which until recently was spared the worst of the violence			1
a blast near the @entity175 headquarters friday was the latest in a string of attacks			0
if these attacks are the work of the government as the opposition alleges , it would be a high - risk strategy			0
bottom line : although street protests persist , the resistance has become more militarized and is beginning to resemble the early stages of the @entity189 insurgency in 2004			1
and the security forces continue house - to - house raids and mass arrests , while relying less on the sort of shelling that reduced parts of @entity76 to rubble			0
more : @entity22 : president defined by violence @entity200 's wife , @entity199			2

it 's been a month since a " cease - fire " was due to come into effect in @entity4
there has been no relief from the violence despite the @entity7 - backed peace plan
it 's starting to resemble early stages of the @entity189 insurgency in 2004
