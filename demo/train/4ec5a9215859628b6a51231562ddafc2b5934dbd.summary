-- @entity1 is no stranger to civil unrest -- just four years ago the same emergency laws brought in this week were used to end political protests that left scores dead and thousands injured			1
while this year 's state of emergency may not differ in substance , it is being projected by the government of @entity12 as different in style			1
the 60 - day clampdown gives the government the power to implement curfews , censor the news media , disperse gatherings and use military force to " secure order			1
" analysts say in this respect it is no different to the law that @entity26 -- a former deputy prime minister who is now leading anti-government protests -- used in 2010 to bring a violent end to months of protests in the capital @entity31			2
but this time , the government says it has no plans to crack down on the protesters that have disrupted the capital @entity31 for weeks			0
labor minister @entity36 , who will oversee the joint operation between the military and the police , told a press conference this week the government would not use weapons and would not attempt to disperse protesters at night			0
in 2010 , the military 's attempt to clear protester encampments at night was widely held to have been responsible for the high death toll of around 80 people			0
the use of the police as a stabilizing force in the deadlock has been widely seen as an attempt by the government to inject a civilian element into the state of emergency			1
in recent weeks , the government has been praised by foreign governments , including the @entity56 , for its restraint in handling the protests			1
despite this , human rights groups fear the state of emergency could boil over if protesters -- who aim to disrupt elections scheduled for february 2 and want to institute an unelected " people 's council " to run the country ahead of a political overhaul -- ratchet up the pressure			1
" this is the same piece of legislation with the same powers , " @entity69 of @entity70 told @entity0			0
" her ( @entity12 ) powers are not limited by this			0
" " while she says she will not use these powers immediately , it will very much depend on the situation , " he said			0
" if she felt that the protesters were instigating violence to stop the elections , she might use some of these powers			0
" our view is that we 're concerned that this ( the state of emergency ) will be viewed as an escalation by the protesters , but on the other hand governments do have a responsibility to maintain some sense of law and order			1
" as long as they do this in a rights - friendly way , i do n't think people will complain about it			2
everything will swing on what happens next			0
" while @entity1 has said it remains open for business despite the state of emergency , the @entity103 issued a travel alert for @entity1 this week , warning @entity56 citizens of the " unpredictable and ongoing demonstration activity " ahead of the elections			1
according to the @entity113 of @entity1 , a total of 34 countries and regions have issued travel warnings for @entity1 , including @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			2
the protests have already rattled the nerves of some of @entity1 's biggest investors			1
on monday , the president of @entity125 's @entity1 unit @entity124 told a press conference the company may reconsider up to 20 billion baht ( $ 609 million ) in investment -- and could even cut production -- if political unrest continues			1
" for new foreign investors , the political situation may force them to look for opportunity elsewhere			0
for those that have already invested , like @entity125 , we will not go away			2
but whether we will invest ( further ) or not , we are not sure			0
" @entity1 is the biggest auto market in @entity139 and is a production and export hub for car manufacturers such as @entity143 and @entity144			2
despite political instability , @entity1 has shown formidable economic growth over the past decade and is still attracting foreign investment from small to medium - sized enterprises			1
in 2010 , the medium - sized design company @entity149 decided to remain in @entity31 despite having its office windows shot out during the crackdown			1
" we have to take the long view			0
if you look at the view over the past five to ten years the growth in @entity1 has been phenomenal , " @entity153 , @entity149 chief executive officer , told @entity0			2
" of course it would be better if it was n't there and in the short - term our business has been affected but it 's not catastrophic , " he said			0
" you do n't come to a country like @entity1 and invest over a three or four - month period -- it 's a long - term commitment			1
" he said that his company was expecting the situation to resolve itself and that by april or may it would be business as usual			0
" we are now starting to invest back into @entity117 , " said @entity153 , whose company began in @entity117 , established itself in @entity1 in 1994 and and now has nine offices and 450 staff worldwide			2
" i think that shows that if we can do it , anyone can			0

@entity1 has a long *history* of civil unrest , with dozens of governments since 1946
the state of emergency invokes the same powers that were used in the *bloody* crackdown of 2010
the 60 - day clampdown gives the government wide - ranging powers to maintain public order
large investors such as @entity125 have said continuing unrest could *damage* the @entity1 economy
