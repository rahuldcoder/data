refusing to buckle to violent protests demanding more action , @entity1 's foreign minister insisted thursday his nation " is on @entity5 's side " -- referring to the @entity8 border town in imminent danger of falling to @entity10 -- but still wo n't unilaterally send ground troops to save it			1
time may be running out			0
@entity14 rose over @entity5 , a @entity16 enclave in @entity8 that 's a stone 's throw from the @entity1 border , as @entity21 warplanes pounded @entity10 targets from above while @entity16 fighters tried to fend off the @entity25 extremist group from below			1
but @entity10 is n't backing down			2
it seems to have wrested control of one - third of @entity5 , said the @entity28 , a @entity29 - based monitoring group			1
speaking alongside visiting @entity32 secretary general @entity31 , @entity1 foreign minister @entity30 stressed his country vehemently opposed @entity10 and its actions in @entity5 and elsewhere			1
like it or not , @entity1 is already knee deep in the regional unrest , having taken in more than 1.5 million people from @entity8 and @entity38 , including some 200,000 @entity8 from the @entity5 region in the past two weeks			1
@entity30 said @entity1 supports the @entity21 - led airstrikes against @entity10 , though he stated these can only be so effective			1
" maybe you can stop them for a short period but you can not clean the whole region from @entity10 or some other terrorist organizations , " the foreign minister said			2
" you need to take into consideration all options , including an operation on the ground			0
" the group that could help beat @entity10 that 's what protesters around @entity1 and outside of it have demanded , warning innocent people will be killed in mass -- much like what @entity10 has been accused of in many other communities around @entity8 and @entity38 , since it stepped up its armed campaign to take over territory amid @entity8 's yearslong civil war -- if something drastic is n't done			1
there are ongoing talks about what the international approach to the crisis could look like			0
" once there is a ( common ) decision , @entity1 will not be reluctant to do its part , " @entity30 said			2
" it is not realistic to expect @entity1 to conduct a ground operation on its own , " @entity30 said			2
who 's doing what in the coalition battle @entity76 lashes out against protests calling for action this position wo n't satisfy those who have hit the streets around @entity1 in recent days			1
they 've chanted , marched and clashed with authorities using tear gas and other means			0
" we want more airstrikes , we want a clear message , " said @entity86 , a @entity8 @entity16 politician			1
" ... the massacre is about to happen , and we have to act very ... promptly and intensify our attacks on them			1
" according to @entity94 , the nation 's semiofficial news agency , 30 people have been killed since wednesday across eight locations during what it calls the " illegal protests			2
" this figure does not include six killed thursday in @entity101 , including two police officers shot while " doing damage assessment from the protests			0
" dozens more have been injured in the protests nationwide , including at least three police officers in @entity108 alone			0
agriculture minister @entity109 said 116 people had been arrested in connection with the violence and another 294 face charges for curfew violations			0
president @entity76 criticized the demonstrations , claiming they were tied to connected to the outlawed @entity116 and aimed to " manipulate perceptions of @entity1 's policies , " according to another @entity94 story			0
in a statement , he vowed that @entity1 authorities will go after those behind " these acts of violence , vandalism and looting			0
" @entity1 's tough choice : take on @entity10 or the @entity116 ? " @entity1 will never tolerate any traps against our peace , stability or sense of brotherhood , " @entity76 said			2
at the same time , the @entity1 government says it stands with @entity16 on both sides of the @entity8 border unnerved by @entity10 ' advance			1
@entity30 rejected the suggestion that @entity1 had hung back , saying it has " never acted reluctantly on this issue			0
" he also denied " discrimination on a sectarian basis " -- i.e. , not choosing to act because @entity16 were the primary victims in @entity5 -- was in play in @entity1 's decisions			1
last week , @entity144 passed a resolution last week authorizing action against the terrorist group			0
the main opposition party , the @entity148 , said it will back this motion to authorize the army 's ground operations as long as it is limited to rescuing @entity5 and repelling @entity10			1
witnesses : @entity10 ' gets reinforced , situation ' very bad ' if @entity10 manages to take @entity5 , it will control a complete swath of land between its self - declared capital of @entity158 , @entity8 , and @entity1 -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers ( 62 miles )			1
the @entity21 wants @entity1 to do more , @entity21 administration officials said , and is urging @entity1 to at least fire artillery at @entity10 targets across the border			1
witnesses inside @entity5 told @entity165 that airstrikes wednesday had been welcome but that the situation worsened thursday			0
one fighter said that the situation was " very bad " and that @entity10 had received reinforcements , in the form of a " large " number of fighters and vehicles , overnight			0
the fighter said @entity10 troops have re-entered the eastern side of the city and called for the @entity21 - led coalition to launch airstrikes there , where the onslaught is greatest			2
he said there had been only two strikes thursday morning			0
a media activist also in the town described intense street - to - street fighting around the @entity16 security forces ' headquarters , near the center of @entity5 , as well as in the south of the town			1
he also called for more airstrikes against @entity10 , saying the two so far thursday were not enough			0

another three airstrikes north of @entity5 hit two small @entity10 groups and destroyed two buildings			2
