-- one of the prosecutors in the @entity3 trial said wednesday there could be perjury charges against @entity7 's mother , @entity3			1
@entity3 testified that she was responsible for @entity10 searches on the family 's home computer for information about chloroform			1
but records indicated she was at work at the time			1
prosecutors had alleged that @entity3 , 25 , killed her daughter , @entity3 , in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform , putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate , or a combination of the two acts			1
asked by @entity28 's " @entity27 " whether legal action will be taken against @entity3 for allegedly perjuring herself on the witness stand , @entity26 responded , " i think there could be			1
that will be a decision made by another branch of our office			1
" @entity26 himself is leaving his post , proceeding with a retirement that he had delayed to take on the @entity3 case			1
the trial ended tuesday with @entity3 acquitted of murder , manslaughter , and child abuse in the death of her daughter			2
she was convicted of lying to police , a misdemeanor that usually results in no jail time			2
asked by @entity28 whether he would pursue @entity3 for perjury if he were staying , @entity26 responded , " i honestly do n't know			1
that would be a very , very difficult decision to make			2
as a prosecutor -- i 've been a prosecutor for 30 years -- i hate to say this , but you 're somewhat accustomed to family members trying to help their fellow family members			2
so you 're kind of used to that			0
" this , of course , was a rather important , you know , deception , if you will , that obviously was proven to be so by the other evidence			0
what they do with it is going to be a difficult decision that i 'm glad i do n't have to make			0
" @entity26 was on @entity75 's " dr. @entity74 " wednesday evening at 9 p.m. et. @entity76 , a criminal defense attorney analyzing the @entity3 trial for @entity0 , said she believes " they 've got enough evidence to prove " perjury , but " from a personal , human standpoint , i do n't think we 're going to see it happen			1
" remember , no matter what we think of @entity3 , she is a victim here			0
she is a grieving grandmother			0
... so we know that she truly truly loved that little girl and misses her			0
and , at this point , all she was trying to do was save her daughter 's life and it worked			0
so at this point i think any prosecution is going to look like sour grapes			0
