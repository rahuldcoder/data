@entity0 -- a little over 30 years ago , @entity2 was just another gritty , working class neighborhood to the northeast of central @entity0			1
today , boutique cafes dot the high street , hipsters with delicately manicured beards saunter about on fixie bikes while flash newbuild apartments rise high above the local train station			2
" it 's just such a cool place with lots of creative people , " said 23 - year - old @entity13 , a fashion student originally from @entity14 who lives nearby			1
a short bus journey south reveals a similar story in @entity21 , the nerve - center of east @entity0 's flourishing tech hub and home to the newly developed " @entity25			1
" like in @entity2 , local council initiatives and business incentives have enticed nascent start - ups and ambitious young professionals in the creative and tech industries to the area			1
a glimpse through a ground level office window reveals a group of twenty - somethings lounging around on bean bags as they daintily tap away at @entity38 and tablets			2
across the room , another casually dressed bunch huddles around a table tennis table with bats in hand ready to brainstorm			2
" ( since the 1980s ) a community has developed here across all of the arts , " explained local councilor @entity45			2
" that community gradually over the years gathered more of a presence			2
" the @entity0 borough of @entity53 ( where @entity2 and @entity21 are situated ) has attracted the highest proportion of people working in culture , media and sporting industries across the city in recent times , according to analysis of census data by real estate agency , @entity64			1
but beyond the young urbanites that have come to populate these areas , one does n't have to look too hard to find traces of the old @entity2 and @entity21			1
bargain stores , pawnbrokers and bookmakers remain a prominent feature while a social housing trust receives visitors on the ground floor of an imposing tower block a few hundred yards from @entity79 train station			0
by comparison , a nearby street once nicknamed " murder mile , " due to its high number of drug and gun related crimes , is now filled with cocktail bars , designer denim stores and organic green grocers			0
" we 've got lots of new bars ... but those who were born and bred here simply ca n't afford to live here anymore , " wrote local political candidate and resident @entity92 in the @entity95 's @entity94 newspaper recently			0
" it has caused real problems for the youngsters			0
a lot of them do n't know where they should go now , or where their real communities are			1
" the creative class for @entity2 and @entity21 in @entity0 , read @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 in @entity117 and many other formerly working class neighborhoods in cities around the world ( with broad regional differences )			1
according to @entity122 , professor of human geography at the @entity123 , what has happened follows a well worn pattern of urban development			1
creative , young , artistic types are enticed to move into an area by low rents or through encouragement from local councils			1
as time passes , more people move in attracted by what they see as the aspirational , cool vibe , hoping to become a part of this fabric themselves			1
this influx brings in higher earning individuals and increases the local tax base which can lead to improved public services			0
but it also pushes up the cost of rent , goods and services in the area and eventually house prices too			0
while this may be no bad thing for the new arrivals who can largely afford it , many of those who have lived in the area for generations can be priced out			0
these issues were passionately highlighted by film director @entity159 earlier this year in an appearance at the @entity161 in @entity162 , @entity111			1
" people want live in @entity164			0
people wan na live in @entity166			0
the @entity167 , they move to @entity110 , they ca n't even afford ... @entity110 now because of ... hipsters , " @entity159 said of the once downtrodden areas that are among the @entity170 's most discussed neighborhoods today			1
some of the new arrivals , who @entity159 accused of having a colonizing " @entity176 syndrome " even move on before the gentrification process is complete , when rents rise or when places become too mainstream for them			0
@entity179 melodramatically asserted that @entity2 was dead in 2013 before highlighting the next low - income areas of the @entity95 capital in line for an influx of so called cool kids			1
according to professor @entity186 , these developments are simply a subtle form of gentrification , hidden behind friendly terms like " unleashing the creative economy , " " regeneration " and " urban renewal			1
" the major difference is that those doing the gentrifying are fond of elaborate facial hair , artisanal food and retro kitsch rather than the formalwear of a shirt and tie			0
" local borough councils have been heavily supportive of policies and processes of gentrification but they 'll call them regeneration , particularly arts led , around places like @entity53 and @entity2 , " @entity186 said			1
a side effect of this has been that " lots of low income social groups in @entity0 now have been moved out beyond the suburbs to low income areas there			1
" building from within yet while far from enthusiastic about these developments , @entity186 is quick to point out that there are multiple layers of complexity that must be recognized when trying to fully grasp this issue			0
city neighborhoods are constantly changing and evolving after all , inviting in a range of demographics and income groups as others move out for pastures new			1
areas that were once prosperous and safe can quickly fall on hard times or vice-versa			2
should districts that have become rundown not also seek to revitalize and improve the lot of the people who live within them ? according to @entity45 , the answer to this question is an emphatic " yes "			0
he describes @entity2 's proud history in the entertainment and design industries before falling on tougher times			1
this is something the local council wants to revive , he said			0
inevitably this will bring many new and creative people to the area			2
" one of the focuses of local government in all of this is to try and work to ensure that the wider community in @entity53 can also remain engaged and part of this change that is going on around them so the many can benefit , " @entity45 said			2
" there 's a great spirit of collaboration in play in trying to mold and shape this opportunity in a way that has a wider social benefit			0
" @entity265 encourages firms to work in conjunction with local schools to offer work experience , internships and apprenticeships at businesses operating in the community			0
many courses at the district 's colleges are also tailored to the creative industries operating in the area			2
these efforts are mirrored in cities experiencing similarly rapid changes around the world			2
professor of architecture , planning and preservation at @entity287 , @entity288 , points to groups such as @entity162 's @entity290 who have worked to ensure there is affordable housing for long - term residents of their neighborhoods and that not everyone is priced out			1
yet even with these well - intentioned attempts at inclusion , tensions between the old and new remain			0
artist , filmmaker and @entity305 professor , @entity301 documented the @entity162 neighborhood of @entity110 -- once home to vibrant @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity311 and @entity312 communities -- as it was rezoned by city authorities and housing developers ( then hipsters ) moved in for her 2012 film , @entity317			1
" its such a ridiculous , horrible neighborhood now , " @entity318 told @entity1			0
" the demographic is basically like being on a college campus			0
everybody is in their mid- 20s , has money and walks around with an iphone in their hand			0
" @entity318 adds that while the majority of these people define themselves as creatives , they actually work in graphic design , advertising or write for magazines -- a far cry from what she defines as truly artistic or creative			2
she also speaks of hearing similar tales in cities like @entity341 , @entity113 and @entity342 while on the promotional tour of her film			2
others however are more anodyne about these developments			0
some even speak of the benefits an influx of new people has brought to their area			0
" i think its a good thing to have lots of different people and new people move here , " said @entity2 grocery store owner , @entity352			1
" ( why would you want to live ) in an area where everyone is the same ? "			0

urban neighborhoods in cities like @entity0 and @entity111 are changing rapidly
young and creative communities have popped up in once working class areas such as @entity2 and @entity110
some say the speed of change is *upending* neighborhoods and pricing out long time residents
others say it is regenerating long *neglected* areas for the better
