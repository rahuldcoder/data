@entity0 -- the @entity2 struggled wednesday to find a constitutional balance between free speech and privacy in a case involving provocative anti-homosexual protests by a small church at the funeral of a soldier who died in @entity11			1
members of the @entity14 - based @entity13 protested outside the court , while inside one of their members argued they have the right to promote what they call a broad - based message on public matters such as wars			1
but the lawyer for the fallen @entity25 's father argued those protests are an invasion of privacy and an intentional infliction of emotional distress			1
" [ justice ] @entity33 said the right to be let alone was the most important , and so he must have been thinking there could be a tort [ lawsuit ] there for interference with privacy , " said justice @entity30 , speaking for many of his colleagues			2
" and emotional injury , deliberately inflicted , could be one			0
... but i see that in some instances that could be abused to prevent somebody from getting out a public message , and therefore , i 'm looking for a line			0
" at issue is a delicate test between the privacy rights of grieving families and the free speech rights of demonstrators , however disturbing and provocative their message			1
several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest			1
the church , led by pastor @entity59 , believes @entity60 is punishing the @entity61 for " the sin of homosexuality " through events including soldiers ' deaths			1
members have traveled the country shouting at grieving families at funerals and displaying such signs as " thank @entity60 for dead soldiers , " " @entity60 blew up the troops " and " @entity74 cures fags			1
" @entity13 members had appeared outside the 2006 funeral for @entity79 @entity78 in @entity80 , @entity81 , outside @entity82			1
@entity78 's family sued the church in 2007 , alleging invasion of privacy , intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy			1
a jury awarded the family $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $ 8 million in punitive damages , which were later reduced to $ 5 million			0
the church appealed the case in 2008 to the 4th district , which reversed the judgments a year later , siding with the church 's allegations that its first amendment rights were violated			1
@entity101 , @entity78 's father , said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral			1
" i was just shocked that any individual could do this to another human being , " @entity78 told @entity1			0
" i mean , it was inhuman			0
" church members say their broader message was aimed at the unspecified actions of the military and those who serve in it			1
they believe @entity61 soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality			2
during wednesday 's intense one - hour arguments , the attorney for the @entity78 side -- @entity121 -- told the court the pain @entity101 suffered occurred before , during and after the funeral			2
that included a posting on the @entity13 website that offered what @entity121 said were more intense personal attacks on the @entity130 than may have occurred at the burial service			2
" but it does not intrude upon the funeral , " said justice @entity132			2
" he does n't have to watch them			0
they are just posted on the @entity137			0
" " why does he have a claim ? " asked justice @entity138			2
the protest " was at considerable distance			0
there was no importuning anyone going to the funeral			0
it stopped before the funeral -- the service -- began			0
" she added that the @entity13 members stayed on public rights - of - way , had the permission of police to gather , and were not arrested			1
@entity121 , however , reiterated the church crossed the line			0
" i believe that the justices heard that and i hope that they realize that this is n't just a case about speech , it 's about harassment , targeted harassment at a private person 's funeral , " @entity121 said afterward			1
in an unususal twist , the attorney representing the church before the @entity2 is also a church member -- @entity169 , a daughter of the pastor			0
she held her own under sometimes withering questioning from several justices , especially over whether the church 's " speech " is personal or public in nature			1
" suppose someone believes that african - americans are inherently inferior , and they are really a bad influence on this country , " justice @entity177 said			0
" and so a person comes up to an african - american and starts berating that person with racial hatred			0
now is this just any old old @entity187 on the street ? that 's a matter of public concern ? " chief justice @entity191 said , " does it make a difference , which seems to me to be the case here , that mr. @entity78 was selected not because of who he was , but because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your client 's particular message ? " @entity169 countered her fellow congregants did not stalk or confront @entity78 or his family			2
" the words that were at issue in this case were people from a church delivering a religious viewpoint , " she said , " commenting not only on the broader public issues that the discussion was under way in this nation about dying soldiers , about the morals of the nation			2
" @entity138 jumped in , noting @entity13 had picketed the @entity81 state @entity215 the same day , just before going to the @entity78 funeral			1
" this is a case about exploiting a private family 's grief , " she said , " and the question is : why should the @entity222 tolerate exploiting this @entity25 's family when you have so many other forums for getting across your message , " such as standing in front of the @entity2			1
about a dozen congregants , including a couple of young children , did just that wednesday , gathering in front of the court building to hold signs , sing hymns , and shout their message			0
they planned later to promote their message at nearby @entity237			0
they had been at the @entity239 and other sites the day before			0
the @entity2 has never addressed the specific issues of laws designed to protect the " sanctity and dignity of memorial and funeral services , " as well as the privacy of family and friends of the deceased			2
but the high court has recognized the state 's interest in protecting people from unwanted protests or communications while in their homes			0
the justices are being asked to address how far states and private entities like cemeteries and churches can go to justify picket - free zones and the use of " floating buffers " to silence or restrict the speech or movements of demonstrators exercising their constitutional rights in a funeral setting			1
a majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the @entity13 church protesters			1
in wednesday 's case , 48 states and dozens of members of @entity279 filed an amicus brief in support of the @entity130			1
@entity13 members told the court they have a duty to protest and picket at certain events , including funerals , to promote their religious message : " that @entity60 's promise of love and heaven for those who obey him in this life is counterbalanced by @entity60 's wrath and hell for those who do not obey him			1
" the congregation is made up mostly of @entity59 and his family			0
the pastor has 13 children , and at least 54 grandchildren and seven great - grandchildren			0
he described himself as an " old - time " gospel preacher in a @entity1 interview in 2006 , saying , " you ca n't preach the @entity307 without preaching the hatred of @entity60			2
" church members have participated in several hundred protests across the country			2
last year , the high court blocked @entity314 's effort to enforce a specific law aimed at the @entity13			1
@entity169 , daughter @entity316 and other church members had protested near the august 2005 funeral of a soldier in @entity320 , @entity314			1
state lawmakers later passed the " spc. @entity322 , " criminalizing picketing " in front of or about " a funeral location or procession			0
the case heard wednesday is @entity327 ( 09 - 751 )			0
a ruling is expected in the next few months			0
@entity1 's @entity329 and @entity330 contributed to this report .			0
