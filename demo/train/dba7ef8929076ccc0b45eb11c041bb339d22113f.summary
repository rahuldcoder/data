-- most of us can appreciate that the world is an ancient place and that a lot has changed in the almost 4.6 billion years since it took its shape			0
it 's not easy to have a feel for the amount of time that has passed , but grappling with deep time helps you understand why an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ( @entity14 ) of 400 parts per million ( ppm ) is meaningful			1
deep time is geologic time and the scale needed to fathom the evolution of life , mountains , oceans , and @entity24 's climate			1
@entity25 , one must note , is not weather			0
weather is experienced day to day			0
climate occurs on longer scales : the tropics are hot and wet ; @entity31 is freezing and miserable			0
if you wanted to consider the climate of the whole planet you would need to consider its temperature			0
without greenhouse gases the world would be a much colder ( ~ 30 ˚ c or 65 ˚ f colder ) and lonelier place			1
all of us have felt the greenhouse effect because water vapor is a greenhouse gas and when summer humidity is high you just ca n't get any relief			1
even at night when the sun is gone , water vapor keeps radiating the heat			0
dry desert nights are just the opposite , with temperatures falling fast when the lights go out			0
@entity14 works the same way as water vapor			0
more co2 radiates more heat , increasing the average temperature and turning more surface water into water vapor , which radiates more heat			1
this is an example of a positive feedback and positive feedbacks push temperatures higher than @entity14 alone			2
global climate models tell us that doubling @entity14 will lead to a global temperature increase between 2 and 4.5 ˚ c ( that 's 3.6 to 8 ˚ f ) , reflecting the climate sensitivity to @entity14			2
since 400 ppm marks a 43 % man - made @entity70 ( from 280 to 400 ppm in ~ 200 years ) , we should soon expect 1 ˚ c ( 1.8 ˚ f ) of warming if low - end estimates of climate sensitivity are correct			0
well , a 1 ˚ c ( 1.8 ˚ f ) global temperature increase is close to what we 've already measured , but full warming is not expressed overnight or even over decades because the world is mostly a cold ocean that helps ameliorate immediate warming by taking up heat			0
also , man - made atmospheric particles could be masking up to 0.5 ˚ c ( 0.9 ˚ f ) of the potential temperature rise			0
with this in mind , we expect temperatures to further increase even if @entity14 stopped rising , and so it 's not alarming to assume that climate sensitivity might be higher than the belief of an optimist			1
so , how much @entity14 is too much ? this is where deep time helps frame our expectations of things to come			2
first , as far as we know , the rate of our co2 rise is unprecedented in @entity24 history			2
that 's saying something , is n't it ? during the well - known glacial - interglacial cycles that occurred in the last one million years , co2 fell to a cold 180 ppm and back up to 280 ppm			1
those changes took thousands to tens - of - thousand of years , so , 400 ppm not only breaks that record , but it breaks it in record time			2
when climate scientists say that they are worried about 2 to 5 ˚ c ( 3.6 -- 9 ˚ f ) of global warming , keep in mind that global temperature was , at most , 4 to 5 ˚ c ( 7.2 -- 9 ˚ f ) colder during the last ice age when miles of ice piled up on land and pushed enough dirt to make @entity119			2
small numbers , like 4 ˚ @entity121 ) of cooling can mean big things , but that 's not where we 're headed any more			2
now we 're headed deeper into the past			0
at best , co2 levels are similar to 4 million years ago when global temperatures were 3 to 4 ˚ @entity130 ) higher , and there was little - to - no ice on @entity133 , and sea levels were at least ~ ~ 20 m ( 65 feet ) higher			1
even if we were to resolve to live in the warmth of the relatively recent past , the nagging problem is that atmospheric @entity14 levels will continue to rise and stay around for a very , very long time without intentional intervention and / or a surprising technological innovation			1
@entity14 is increasing at about 3 ppm per year and we will be arriving at a minimum @entity14 concentration of 700 ppm by year 2100 if nothing is done			0
in terms of our history , that places us somewhere beyond 35 million years ago when there was no permanent ice on the poles and sea level was over 200 feet higher than today			1
add more co2 to the mix and we step back towards peak temperatures 50 million years ago when @entity14 is estimated to have been about 1000 ppm and sub-tropical plants and crocodiles inhabited the poles			1
there 's lots of uncertainty when trying to reconstruct ancient climates and the factors that produced them , but having some sense of the past informs us in the same way as knowing the history of our grandparents and the potential inheritance of future ailments			1
deep time tells us that we are traveling forward to a world that is an extraordinary warm and different place , something @entity24 scientists refer to as a greenhouse world			1
hopefully we will resist the urge to take the trip , but if we do n't , i know a few people who would be happy to study how it all went down			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			1

@entity180 : co2 level in atmosphere *portends* major changes
he says *research* on the past shows the *dangers* of high levels of greenhouse gases
today 's co2 levels comparable to time when @entity133 had little ice , sea was 65 feet higher
@entity180 : with more co2 , we hark back to when crocodiles and sub-tropical plants inhabited the poles
