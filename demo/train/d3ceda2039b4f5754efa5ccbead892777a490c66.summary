-- @entity1 fought like a true champion to extend his winning run to 36 matches this year as he reached the final of the @entity6 at the expense of @entity8 on saturday			1
the @entity9 triumphed 6 - 1 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) in a three - hour semifinal epic to set up another showdown with world no. 1 @entity12 , a player he has beaten in three @entity15 title matches this season			1
second - ranked @entity1 ended the @entity18 's two - year unbeaten run on clay in the @entity21 final , but it remains to be seen whether he has enough energy in reserve to repeat that on sunday			1
@entity12 had a much easier passage as he defeated @entity27 16th seed @entity28 7 - 5 6 - 1 in 93 minutes , ending the run of a player who had earlier beaten his longtime rival @entity31 and seventh seed @entity32			1
@entity1 's dream year shows no sign of slowing @entity1 had to dig deep as @entity8 showed tremendous resolve after capitulating in the first set -- a showing that raised the prospect of a repeat of his @entity43 final defeat against the same player in january			2
but the fourth seed -- who turns 24 on sunday -- battled back to level , inflicting @entity1 's first dropped set of the tournament , and then fought back again after going down 3 - 1 in the decider			2
@entity8 , seeking to become the first @entity53 player to reach a top - level clay final since 1982 , broke @entity1 's serve twice in a row -- the second time to love - as he went 4 - 3 ahead			1
but @entity1 , who could have gone top in the rankings if @entity12 had not reached the last four , broke back immediately			2
both players then dropped serve again -- @entity8 after a morale - sapping double fault -- but then held to take the match to a tie - break			0
@entity1 had appeared to be on his last legs at several stages , but appeared rejuvenated as he raced to a 5 - 1 lead before reaching the final of an event he won in 2008			0
he then roared with relief at an appreciative crowd as he showed just how much the victory meant to him ahead of his own 24th birthday on may 22			0
@entity12 beat @entity1 in the 2009 @entity6 final , and has won the event for five of the past six years			1
but his status as " @entity12 " is under serious threat this year ahead of the @entity76 starting next month , where he is defending champion and seeking a sixth title since 2005			0
" i am playing better every day and a little bit higher , so i think that in general i am happy for everything , " @entity12 , who was hampered by illness earlier this week , told the @entity82 website			0
" i 'm in another final , six in a row , and it is unbelievable			0
i had a tough week , so i am very happy for everything			0
