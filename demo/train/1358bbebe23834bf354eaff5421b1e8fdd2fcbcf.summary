@entity0 , @entity1 -- after more than two years of delays , @entity4 's @entity3 made its maiden flight tuesday in a three - hour trip that the maker described as a success			1
" today is truly a proud and historic day for the global team who has worked tirelessly to design and build the @entity3 -- the first all - new jet airplane of the 21st century , " said @entity10 , vice president and general manager of the 787 program , in a news release			1
" we look forward to the upcoming flight test program and soon bringing groundbreaking levels of efficiency , technology and passenger comfort to airlines and the flying public			1
" more than 12,000 employees and guests watched as the plane took off at 10:27 a.m. from @entity28 in @entity0 , @entity1			0
it landed more than three hours later and about 40 miles away at @entity30 , @entity1 's @entity31 after having flown at a speed of 207 mph at 15,000 feet -- typical for a maiden flight , the company said			2
during their time aloft , the chief pilot and captain tested some of the airplane 's systems and structures while flight data were transmitted electronically to engineers at @entity31			0
" the flight marks the beginning of a flight test program that will see six airplanes flying nearly around the clock and around the globe , with the airplane 's first delivery scheduled for fourth quarter 2010 , " @entity4 's news release said			1
@entity4 promises passengers " a better flying experience " that includes bigger windows , more luggage space and better lighting			1
it promises airline operators greater efficiency by burning 20 percent less fuel than current models of comparable size and by providing as much as 45 percent more space for cargo			0
so far , 55 customers have ordered 840 of the planes			0
the official price of one is $ 150 million			0
" we think this is going to be a very efficient airplane , " @entity69 , @entity4 executive vice president and ceo , told @entity2			1
" it 's going to change the way people travel			0
" despite the delays , @entity4 's first new commercial airliner in more than a decade will still be relevant , @entity69 said monday			2
" it 's more environmentally friendly , it 's more efficient , uses less fuel , it 's going to cost the operator less to fly , it 's going to allow the passengers to pay less and feel better when they land , " he said			1
@entity4 's fuel claims are linked to its design			1
it is the first major airliner to be made mostly of composite materials and , as a result , is lighter			1
depending on the configuration , the plane can seat 200 to 300 passengers and can travel more than 2,500 nautical miles			1
but production delays and technical problems have stolen some of the @entity3 's luster			2
many of the snags in the supply line have been blamed on the army of partners @entity4 brought in to help with the construction			2
" they did too much outsourcing , too soon , with too little oversight , " said @entity103 of the aviation consulting firm @entity104 " the customers have been mightily [ upset ] over the creeping delays			0
" @entity69 acknowledged that , " in hindsight , " the level of outsourcing may not have been the best strategy			0
" there a few things we might have kept inside , yes , " he said			0
with 10 months of flight tests ahead , the 787s wo n't start flying commercially until at least 2011 , the company said			2
" there 's a lot of work to do , " @entity69 said .			0
