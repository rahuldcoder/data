@entity0 -- citing economic progress and other achievements , president @entity2 on friday rejected the contention that 2013 was the worst year of his presidency			1
polls show @entity2 's approval rating at record lows for the nearly five years he 's been in office , but he told reporters at a year - end news conference that his concern is whether things are getting better for the @entity16 people			1
" if you 're measuring this by polls , my polls have gone up and down a lot through the course of my career , " @entity2 said			1
" if i was interested in polling , i would n't have run for president			0
" instead , he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in january 2009 and other progress , such as more than 1 million people signing up for health insurance so far under the controversial reforms he championed			2
" that is a big deal			0
that 's why i ran for this office , " @entity2 said			1
nagging controversies later in the news conference that lasted just over an hour , he shrugged off persistent questions about controversies involving @entity39 , government surveillance and other issues with a rudimentary summation of how he sees his administration 's role			0
" we get this privilege for a pretty short period of time to do as much as we can for as many people as we can to help them live better lives , " @entity2 said			1
at the end , he wished the assembled journalists happy holidays and walked out a few hours before the first family 's trip to @entity57 on friday night			0
@entity2 ca n't be sad to see 2013 ending			0
his legislative agenda outlined in his inauguration address last january after winning re-election and his @entity63 speech a few weeks later made little headway in the divided @entity65			0
classified leaks by former @entity69 contractor @entity67 disclosed details of @entity16 surveillance efforts that raised questions about whether the government spied on its own people			1
then came the botched rollout in october of the new @entity77 website			0
instead of cementing @entity2 's legacy as the president who helped uninsured @entity16 get affordable health coverage , the dysfunctional website opened the @entity82 to a new wave of attacks by @entity85 seeking to dismantle the reforms			1
@entity2 frustration @entity2 acknowledged the website problems caused " great frustration , " but he rejected @entity85 claims the overall reform law was failing and should be scrapped			1
asked what was his biggest mistake of 2013 , the president cited the website woes and accepted responsibility , saying : " since i 'm in charge , obviously we screwed it up			1
" another disappointment cited by the president was the inability to get any of his main legislative priorities of 2013 passed by @entity65 , and he called for 2014 to be a " year of action " on immigration reform , job creation , expanded background checks on gun purchasers and extending long - term unemployment benefits			0
" we head into next year with an economy that 's stronger than it was at the start of the year , " @entity2 said			1
" i firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for @entity16			1
" noting a compromise budget agreement recently passed by @entity65 after two years of partisan impasses on government spending , @entity2 said : " it 's probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship , but it 's also fair to say that we 're not condemned to endless gridlock			2
" however , he refused to budge in his rejection of @entity85 calls for concessions in return for their agreement to increase the federal borrowing limit -- known as the debt ceiling -- when required as soon as early march			0
" no , we 're not going to negotiate for @entity65 to pay bills that it has accrued , " @entity2 said			0
" it is not a negotiating tool			0
" @entity69 snooping asked about the @entity69 surveillance , @entity2 defended the government collection of telephone metadata -- records of the time and numbers called with no information on content -- revealed by @entity67 's classified leaks			2
he said he would make " a pretty definitive " decision in january on recommendations from an independent panel that advised stronger oversight and transparency for the surveillance network without dismantling it			0
however , @entity2 added that " what is also clear from the public debate , people are concerned about the possibility of abuse , " such as someone listening in on their phone calls			2
" this is only going to work if the @entity16 people have confidence and trust , " he said , adding there had been no alleged instances of the @entity69 acting beyond its legal authority in the use of data it collects			2
@entity1 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			2
