-- consumer reports , self - promoted as the largest independent consumer - testing organization in the world , recently subjected @entity5 's all - electric vehicle to its standard gamut of automotive tests			1
the results were nothing short of extraordinary , as the model came just one point short of acing the 50 - test evaluation regimen			0
its final score of 99 out of 100 meant the @entity17 " performed better than any other car we 've ever tested , " said @entity18 , director of auto testing at the publication ( @entity22 owners will correctly argue that the 2007 @entity23 also earned a score of 99 in a @entity1 comparison years ago )			1
when the @entity1 results were released with the expected publicity and hype , many looked at the near - perfect score and extrapolated that the car was the best car ever made			1
the @entity17 is an extraordinary clean - sheet effort from a small @entity33 automaker , but i 'd stop several yards short of considering it — or any automobile , for that matter — the world 's best car			1
@entity5 : @entity1 ' best car ever tested without question , @entity5 's combustion - free five - door is innovative and awe - inspiring			1
i understand how the team at @entity1 became enamored with its effortless acceleration ; cavernous , whisper - quiet interior ; and glass panel technology			2
in fact , in my own first drive review published last fall , i called an early production model the " world 's first practical , no - compromise , noncombustion automobile			0
" yes , it is pioneering			0
yet before anyone slaps a blue ribbon and a hearty best accolade on its sleek windshield , it is time for a reality check — the @entity17 is hardly one point away from flawless			0
even after overlooking all the @entity17 ' objective blemishes ( the team over at @entity1 mentioned its lack of certain high - end features , stereo issues and parasitic battery energy losses when parked ) , electric vehicles lack a national infrastructure of charging points , accessible cross-country range and remain cost prohibitive for most consumers			1
these are major hurdles , preventing tens of millions from even considering vehicles like the @entity17 do n't feel sorry for just the electric crowd , either			2
the same hindrances are lodged at other alternative - energy vehicles , such as those powered by hydrogen and natural gas			0
@entity5 's high - scoring 85 kwh @entity17 , arguably at the top of its pure - electric segment , is limited to a range of about 265 miles			1
even though it may be plugged into any common 110 - volt electrical outlet for a slow charge , high - speed electric vehicle charging stations have only sprung up in major population centers or along busy highway corridors , meaning a lack of foresight before heading down a less - traveled road may initiate a tow truck encounter			1
according to the @entity33 @entity95 , there are more than 5,800 electric charging stations in the @entity33 , but just two public charging stations in @entity98 , and zero in @entity99 ( @entity5 plans to have a nationwide network of its so - called supercharger stations within a couple of years )			1
i do n't need to remind anyone that gasoline for combustion vehicles is as readily available as pasteurized milk , and still less expensive			0
and to revisit the cost , according to a recent study by @entity110 , the average transaction price for a new passenger car was $ 30,812 in january of this year			0
the flagship @entity5 model tested by @entity1 wore an $ 89,650 window sticker , nearly three times the national average			1
test drive : @entity117 to @entity118 in a @entity17 a true best car would n't just need a bladder - busting range , readily available fuel or a price that would make it attainable by all			2
it would need to be every bit as adept in a @entity127 winter as it would be comfortable in a @entity128 summer			0
it would have to be safe in crash testing , smooth on the highway , maneuverable around town and compact enough to fit into a crowded city garage			0
some would even ask for off - road and towing capabilities			0
you see where i am going ? no car currently manufactured deserves the coveted best car trophy , and that includes @entity1 ' 99 - point @entity143 transportation needs are uniquely individual , based on occupation , regional location , household size , income and , of course , taste			2
giving a vehicle a near - perfect score is acceptable — and there will undoubtedly be others just as impressive — but assuming that one vehicle trumps others and satisfies all equally is misguided and presumptuous			0
to those who consider the model s the world 's best car , i throw out this question : what 's the world 's best shoe ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity1 said @entity17 performed better than any car they 've tested
@entity166 : without question , @entity5 is an innovative and awe - inspiring electric car
harley : but @entity5 has issues too , such as its high cost and *dearth* of charging stations
