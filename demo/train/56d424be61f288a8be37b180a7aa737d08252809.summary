@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's time this debate was settled once and for all			2
football or soccer ? what do you think the round - ball game should be called ? while it may be a basic discussion ; arguing whether the beautiful game should be called " football " or " soccer " is one of the most fundamental debates of the code			1
on the face it , the answer should be simple			0
the world body -- @entity22 -- has the word " football " in its title			1
end of story ? not quite			0
the term soccer was coined as slang for " association , " in @entity0 in the 1880s			2
the @entity32 's web site explains that former @entity0 captain @entity33 is commonly credited with its origin			2
soccer would have been used to differentiate between @entity37 sports rugby football ( " rugger " ) and " association " football			1
therefore , contrary to popular belief , the word soccer is a @entity45 term , not an @entity47 one			1
soccer is more commonly used in countries that play other forms of football , i.e. @entity47 also play gridiron football and @entity53 who play " @entity56 " football -- a completely different sport entirely			1
soccer was initially referred to as football in the @entity47			1
in 1913 the @entity60 was formed			0
in later years , it became the @entity62 and today is known as the @entity62			0
meanwhile they now have the @entity65 , it 's hard to imagine a change to the national side 's " @entity69 " nickname anytime soon			2
the " @entity72 " does n't quite have the same sound to it			0
now , you may be sitting back in @entity45 reading this and wondering why there should be any debate at all about the name of football ? if you are thinking that , just remember one of the most popular shows in @entity45 is called " @entity81 " , so it 's not as clear cut as you may think ! even the sport 's governing body seems to be open to both options			1
at next year 's @entity89 in @entity90 , the area where fans will gather during the tournament is to be called " @entity91 "			2
maybe the word " football " just does n't work ? we 'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why			1
let us know in the @entity100 box below			0
you can also vote in the quick vote on the @entity104 homepage			0
or , if you really want to make your case -- why not post us a video or photos at the @entity108 on @entity109			0

@entity2 asks : should the ' beautiful game ' be called football or soccer ?
the word " football " appears in the name of the game 's governing body
it 's alternative " soccer " is still *widely* used around the world
