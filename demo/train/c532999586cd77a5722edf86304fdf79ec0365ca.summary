-- he seemed a little confused and unsure of his surroundings			2
@entity3 sat alone in a cell , his blue , watery eyes following me as i entered the holding area of a @entity10 courthouse			2
@entity3 is 90 years old , hard of hearing , frail and , according to the police , a dangerous pedophile			1
i 'd wandered into the cells sure i would be rebuffed			2
instead , the second world war veteran seemed keen to talk to me			2
he explained how the allegations against him are motivated by greedy neighbors			2
he claimed they are trying to blackmail him			0
it 's an argument he will make to judges in the coming weeks			0
@entity3 is thought to be the oldest person ever accused of child molestation in @entity25 's over-burdened penal system			1
last year , 2,888 people were charged with having sex with children under 15 in @entity25			1
@entity25 has become the destination of choice for sex tourists looking to prey on children			1
but now the police are raising their game , determined to turn the tide			1
police lt. col. @entity36 leads a small but very determined unit of officers in @entity10 , all dedicated to tracking down pedophiles			1
the workload is going up each month ; officers here are n't sure whether that is because they are simply uncovering more cases , or whether more and more pedophiles are choosing to relocate to @entity25			1
but col. @entity36 is on a mission to catch them and that 's not easy			1
he opened his files to @entity0 , showing us dozens of surveillance videos , photos and cases histories of suspected pedophiles			1
while he and his men may be convinced someone may be sexually molesting children , proving it in court is another matter			2
often a case pivots on the testimonies of the young victims and that means defendants are often tempted to buy off families			0
" @entity68 can change a lot , it can change even the mind of the victims			0
" the suspect might try to approach the victim or the family of the victims , to convince them or give bribery to make them change their statement			0
and if they change their statement , it could be different or totally different i would say			0
that is the most challenge			0
" and @entity83 is clear the law needs reform			1
" there is no specific law about having child pornography in possession , " he said			2
" @entity25 should issue the new law about child pornography specifically			1
" @entity92 is with a small ngo called the @entity94			0
he works closely with col. @entity36 , often accompanying officers on raids			1
his assessment is frank -- and bleak			0
" honestly right now i do n't think it is getting better , i think it is getting worse , because i do n't know , maybe they believe that @entity25 is the best place for them to come to have sex with the children			1
" @entity3 is alleged to have lured girls into his modest rundown bungalow in @entity107 near @entity10			0
just a few houses away , i met the mother of the four girls @entity3 is accused of abusing			0
she denied his claim that she is trying to extort money from him			0
instead she breaks down and weeps as she goes into harrowing detail about the ordeal her daughters endured			0
the youngest girl @entity3 is accused of abusing is just seven years old			0
@entity3 ' case has received media attention because of his age , but there are many thousands of other cases in @entity25 , which largely go unreported			1
like @entity125 banker @entity124 , who pleaded guilty to abusing young boys in @entity10 -- he was facing a four year sentence , but this was halved because he cooperated with the police			1
in the end , he was granted parole immediately and was deported back to @entity125 after he 'd paid a 4,000 baht fine ( about $ 125 )			0
such cases do little to discourage pedophiles from coming to @entity25			1
col. @entity36 says online forums are abuzz with talk about @entity25 being a child molesters ' paradise			1
" there is a group of the pedophiles online , it is a community , they talk with each other and they like to come to a third world country where the criminal justice system is not strong enough to deal with them			2
" another case working its way through the penal system is that of @entity147 , a @entity150 @entity149 teaching biology at a @entity151			0
the police accuse him of sexually abusing young boys , something @entity147 denies			2
col. @entity36 had him under surveillance for weeks			1
the photos show @entity147 talking to groups of young boys on the street and taking other boys swimming at a local pool			0
a video of a police search of his apartment revealed semi-clothed youths in his bedroom			2
all this will form part of the case against him , which is due to start later this month			0
col. @entity36 has this message to pedophiles thinking of coming to @entity25 : " i would welcome them to come here , i 'm looking for them and if they think they can escape let 's try			1
i will get them one way or another			0
i will make sure they get punished			0

last year , 2,888 people were charged with having sex with children under 15 in @entity25
