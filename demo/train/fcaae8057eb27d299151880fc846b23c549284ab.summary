-- @entity1 may have clung on to his world number one status but after a disappointing final round at the @entity5 will have to rely on captain @entity6 to play in the @entity7			1
woods needed to finish in the top 15 at @entity9 to have any chance of forcing his way into the eight automatic selections for the @entity15 team to face @entity16 at @entity17 in october			1
handily placed after three rounds , @entity1 stumbled to a one - over 73 to end up in a tie for 28th			2
" i hit my irons really good today			0
i drove it terrible , " was his verdict			0
his performance was certainly an improvement on a disastrous showing in the preceding @entity27 and @entity1 briefly led at the start of his first round , but after that the inconsistencies crept in			1
" i did n't miss a shot for the first four holes			0
and then after that i hit it awful , " he added			0
@entity8 could have done with replicating the final round 67 of arch - rival @entity36 , which lifted him into a tie for 12th , but not enough to surpass his fellow @entity15 in the rankings			1
@entity1 is now hoping that @entity15 captain @entity6 will make him one of his four captain 's picks			1
" @entity6 texts me a lot so , i 'm sure he 'll be texting me or calling me and i 'm sure we 'll be talking			2
" we still have what , two more weeks , right ? two more weeks before the picks ? three more weeks ? " @entity1 is still searching for his first win of a truncated season and has not claimed a major since the @entity51 in 2008			2
consolation for runner - up @entity53 and @entity55 , who was penalized two shots to miss out on the playoff , comes as they have moved into the automatic eight spots			0
@entity61 's @entity60 has sealed his place in the @entity16 team after his first major victory , while @entity65 , who tied 12th , has also forced his way into the nine automatic selection spots			1
it leaves @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 now requiring picks from captain @entity73 , but @entity75 's decision to take a break from golf has made his decision a little easier .			0

@entity1 finishes outside the top eight spots for the @entity15 @entity7 team
@entity84 number one blows his chance with disappointing final round at @entity9
he will now rely on a pick from @entity15 captain @entity6
@entity5 winner @entity60 *clinches* his spot on @entity16 team
