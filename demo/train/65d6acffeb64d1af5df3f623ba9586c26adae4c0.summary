-- last week , the " @entity3 " morphed into the " @entity1 on @entity2			2
" the shots that started both wars were fired by two commentators , @entity7 and @entity8			1
whose words were worse ? @entity7 wins that contest , in my book			1
his words were offensive in and of themselves			2
@entity8 's words were offensive because the context they were used in led people to see them as a slight to stay - at - home moms			1
later in the week , @entity23 adviser @entity22 and president @entity24 adviser @entity21 got into a @entity26 duel , or maybe we should just call it tweet - for - tat			1
@entity22 took umbrage with recent @entity31 comments made by comedian and @entity24 donor @entity33			1
@entity21 , in turn , accused @entity22 of " studied outrage			2
" if the outrage was studied , it came straight from the @entity39 ' playbook			2
what we learned in @entity42 was then applied to @entity43			0
the lessons will be with us for other campaigns to follow			0
when @entity7 made his comments attacking @entity48 , @entity46 were slow to react			1
it was n't until days after that more @entity3 voices started to publicly disagree with what he 'd said			0
@entity23 finally gave a tepid answer saying it was n't the language he would have used			1
@entity39 were quick and skillful in branding @entity7 's words with the @entity3 label , which they stamped on every @entity3 running for anything in @entity60			1
the presidential candidates all disagreed with his claims but were left to pay the price			0
it took several days for @entity7 to apologize and only after a national boycott of his radio show , leaving some to perceive the apology as economically motivated			1
what began as a strong @entity3 defense of religious liberties turned into an epic battle for women 's rights			2
@entity39 cleverly coined it the " @entity3			0
" it was a brilliant move			0
polls showed a gender gap favoring @entity24 of as much as 20 points			1
both camps understand the election can hinge on who women support and how many of us turn out			0
@entity24 hosted a women 's forum in the @entity84			1
@entity23 began using multiple rows of women as backdrops at his events			1
he held a roundtable with women , and his campaign organized a women - themed conference call , all within hours of each other			0
both candidates engaged in a blatantly political chess game to outmaneuver each other to show their feminine side			0
just then , @entity8 strategist @entity8 said in an interview that @entity101 " has never worked a day in her life			1
" republicans gave @entity39 a taste of their own medicine			0
it took minutes for @entity46 operatives to denounce the " @entity109 " and spring into action pinning @entity8 's words on @entity24 's			1
@entity39 wasted no time either			0
they triple dissed her -- disowned , disagreed and distanced			0
in less than 24 hours , president @entity24 , @entity112 , @entity113 and every campaign staffer from @entity21 to the lowliest intern was disavowing @entity8 's statement			1
@entity8 herself learned from @entity7 what not to do			1
she apologized quickly , sincerely and repeatedly			2
she put her ego aside , not easy for any of us in the business of politics , and recognized the best course of action for her party was not to add fuel to the fire by endlessly defending herself			0
she canceled a scheduled appearance on @entity129			0
political messaging has become an art form			0
it matters less if outrage is genuine or exaggerated and more that it is believable and contagious			0
amid all the carefully contrived women frenzy , the substance of the issues can end up lost on the battlefield			1
unfortunately , we have n't spent nearly as much time clearly articulating what the candidates are specifically proposing to improve women 's lives as we have hurling accusations and making declarations of war			2
in the not - too - distant future , political science classes will compare these two incidents as case studies in political crisis management 101			0
in today 's world , any gaffe can go viral in minutes and turn into a major issue			2
it 's crucial to react immediately , express strongly worded disagreement and regret , and then recede in hopes it will die quickly in the ever - churning news cycle			1
the other side should pounce on every opportunity to turn an unfortunate choice of words into an all - out war over a noble cause or demographic group and fan the flames of outrage and rebellion			0
in the meantime , all of us engaged in punditry will be reciting the @entity180 ' prayer : " dear lord , please keep me from saying things i will regret , words i 'd rather forget			0
let me give views , not make news			0
if i fail , let me be wise and quickly apologize			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 : in recent weeks we *'ve* seen two commentators face *firestorm* of *criticism*
she says @entity23 's forces were slow to respond to @entity7 attack on @entity48
@entity24 's team responded with *ferocity* to @entity8 's comments , @entity199 says
@entity199 : responding quickly is essential , but substance is getting lost in *rhetorical* wars
