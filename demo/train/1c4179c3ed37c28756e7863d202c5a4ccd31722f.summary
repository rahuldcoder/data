@entity0 -- the recent discovery of a severed head , two hands and two feet in the @entity6 is near the home of actor @entity8 , and authorities have interviewed his bodyguard for possible leads , police said thursday			1
" it 's standard procedure for us to have our detectives canvass the neighborhood , " @entity12			0
the bodyguard saw nothing unusual , he said			0
in an unusual coincidence , @entity8 starred in the film " seven , " in which he plays a detective and a severed head is found a box			1
meanwhile , the dog walker whose canine discovered the head in a park near the @entity31 sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop			1
" our assumption was that there was always people filming up there , and it was a prop , " @entity35 told @entity36			1
" we walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head			2
" in what police described as their biggest search in recent memory , 120 investigators scoured a seven - acre parcel of a park looking for clues in the dismemberment , which authorities believe occurred elsewhere , @entity17 said			2
" we do n't believe the murder occurred up here in the hills , " @entity17 told reporters			0
" right now , there is somebody who committed murder somewhere out there			0
" as of late thursday morning , police had n't discovered any more remains or significant clues , @entity17 said			2
at least 30 @entity0 police officers , a dozen coroner 's investigators , helicopters , all - terrain vehicles , a swat team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers were searching a section of @entity75 , next to @entity76 , @entity17 said			2
the coroner 's cadaver dog , who @entity17 said became exhausted at times wednesday , was back on the trail after sunrise thursday , sniffing for more remains of the victim			1
but authorities still have n't located the torso			0
" we 're going to leave no stone unturned , " @entity17 said			0
the head is that of a man between 40 and 60 years old , with salt - and - pepper - colored hair , @entity89 deputy chief coroner @entity88 said			1
investigators " have every reason to believe " the hands , feet and head belonged to the same person , @entity17 said			1
fingerprints taken from the severed hands could help identify the man , police said			1
" that 's what we 're hoping , " @entity17 said			0
investigators also will use dental records and dna in trying to identify the victim , but they are hoping the fingerprints could more readily provide an identification			0
authorities plan to conclude their three - day hillside search thursday afternoon and reopen the park to the public friday , @entity17 said			0
" we ask people to be cautious			0
do n't go off alone , " the commander advised			0
searchers using the coroner 's cadaver dog located the two hands and two feet scattered across seven acres of brushy and steep terrain , police said			1
authorities believe the human remains were placed in one spot and then were spread by wild animals , @entity17 said			1
" with the wildlife we have here with the coyotes and whatnot , if a body part is left up there , it 's not long before it 's disturbed by the animals , " he said			1
the body parts were hidden until the animals found them , @entity17 said			1
" you could say it was a determined effort to hide them , " @entity17 said of the body parts , declining to elaborate			1
" there was no intent that these were something that the public would find			0
" wednesday 's search located first one hand , about 50 yards from where the head was found			1
another hand and then two feet were found just before waning daylight forced an end to that day 's search , police officer @entity149 said			1
the person who placed the severed appendages in the @entity6 had to go out of his way , walking to an off - the - beaten - path location to leave the limbs , @entity17 said			0
" had it not been for the dog walker , we may not have found " the remains , @entity17 said			1
the real - life @entity31 mystery began tuesday afternoon when two people noticed their dogs dragging a plastic grocery bag from a bush near a dirt trail , police said			1
the women were shocked when they realized a severed head was inside			2
in an interview with @entity36 , @entity35 , the dog walker , said she was walking eight dogs when one of them , a golden retriever named @entity179 , ran away from her			1
@entity35 was joined by her mother , who was walking her own dog			2
" we were wandering the trail and the dogs are sniffing around , and he ( @entity179 ) pulled away from me and made a beeline for some brush			2
he was barking , " @entity35 said			0
" a few minutes later , he had something in his mouth , which he immediately dropped , " @entity35 said			0
the object rolled down the ravine , @entity35 said			0
@entity35 and her mother discovered it was a human head belonging to what she described as a white man			1
" we were pretty much gasping , saying , ' oh , my @entity200 ! ' i was shaking			0
it felt like a script , " @entity35 said			0
" it still does n't feel real			0
" the secluded trails , adjacent to @entity76 , are a favorite place for residents , including many celebrities , to walk their dogs or hike			2
the coroner 's office is examining whether the man was dead when the dismemberment occurred , and what kind of instrument may have been used to remove the head and limbs , @entity17 said			1
police do n't have a theory on what happened			2
" right now , we 're keeping an open mind ... on why this poor person was dismembered and deposited up there , " @entity17 said			0
detectives estimated the man had been dead since sunday			2
police are also checking recent missing - person reports for leads , @entity88 said			2
@entity1 's @entity229 and @entity230 and @entity36 's @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
