-- a forceful @entity1 went toe - to - toe with president @entity3 on the dominant issues for voters , challenging the @entity7 's policies on the economy , taxes and health care in the first of three debates ahead of the november election			1
in exchanges full of policy proposals , facts and figures , the @entity15 challenger was more aggressive in the 90 - minute encounter in criticizing @entity3 's record and depicting the president 's vision as one of big government			1
the president firmly defended his achievements and challenged his rival 's prescriptions as unworkable			0
neither candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels , and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date			0
but @entity1 came off as the more energized candidate overall by repeatedly attacking @entity3 on red - meat issues for @entity15 such as health care reform and higher taxes , while the president began with lengthy explanations and only later focused more on what his opponent was saying			1
moderator @entity43 of @entity44 , at times , tried without success to keep the candidates within time limits for responses , especially @entity3 , who ended up speaking four minutes longer than @entity1			1
" a week ago , people were saying this was over			0
we 've got a horse race , " said @entity0 senior political analyst @entity52 , who called the debate @entity1 's best so far after the 22 the former @entity55 governor took part in during the @entity15 primary campaign			1
@entity60 , a @entity15 strategist and @entity0 contributor , expressed surprise at @entity1 's strong performance , saying he " rose to the moment " and seemed to benefit from the multiple primary debates			2
" it looked like @entity1 wanted to be there and president @entity3 did n't want to be there , " noted @entity67 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity69			1
" the president did n't bring his @entity75			0
" a @entity0 / @entity77 poll of 430 people who watched the debate showed 67 % thought @entity1 won , compared to 25 % for @entity3			1
@entity1 's strongest moments came in repeating his frequent criticism of @entity3 's record , saying the nation 's high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery showed the president 's policies have n't worked			1
" there 's no question in my mind if the president is re-elected , you 'll continue to see a middle - class squeeze , " @entity1 said , adding that another term for @entity3 also will mean the @entity89 , known as @entity90 , " will be fully installed			1
" at another point , he noted how $ 90 billion spent on programs and policies to develop alternative energy sources could have been devoted to hiring teachers or other needs that would bring down unemployment			0
@entity3 argued that his policies were working to bring @entity106 back from the financial and economic crisis he inherited , and that @entity1 refused to divulge specifics about his proposed tax plans and replacements for the health care reform act and @entity114 reform act that the @entity15 has pledged to repeal			1
" at some point , the @entity106 people have to ask themselves if the reason that governor @entity1 is keeping all these plans secret is because they 're too good , " @entity3 said			2
what questions went unanswered ? share your thoughts with @entity123 on taxes , @entity3 said @entity1 's plan of tax cuts for the rich had failed before and would fail again now			1
describing the @entity1 tax plan as a $ 5 trillion cut , @entity3 echoed a line from former president @entity131 by saying the math does n't add up without increasing tax revenue , which @entity1 rejects " i think math , common sense and our history shows us that 's not a recipe for job growth , " @entity3 said			2
@entity1 , however , said @entity3 still pushed the same policies as when he took office four years earlier , and those steps had failed to bring down high unemployment and get the economy surging again			1
he rejected @entity3 's characterization of his tax plan , saying it wo n't add to the deficit , and criticized the president 's call for allowing tax rates on income over $ 250,000 for families and $ 200,000 for individuals to return to the higher rates of the 1990s			0
" @entity156 for @entity157 has said that will cost 700,000 jobs			0
i do n't want to cost jobs , " @entity1 said			0
@entity3 responded that the revenue issue is " a major difference " he has with @entity1 , noting the former @entity55 governor rejected the idea of cutting $ 10 in spending for every $ 1 in new revenue during the @entity15 primary campaign			2
complete coverage : @entity0 's election center in his strongest line of the night , @entity3 said @entity1 lacked the important leadership quality of being able to say " no " when necessary			1
" i 've got to tell you , governor @entity1 , when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign , has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party , " @entity3 said in reference to his challenger 's swing to the right during the primaries to appeal to the @entity15 's conservative base			2
@entity1 repeatedly went after @entity3 on the health care reform bill , at one point asking why the president focused so strongly on a measure that passed with no @entity15 support instead of devoting more attention to the high unemployment and creaking economy			1
with polls narrowing less than five weeks before @entity196 , @entity3 and @entity1 launched a new phase in a bitter race dominated so far by negative advertising as both camps try to frame the election to their advantage			2
whether it matters is itself a topic of debate			0
according to an analysis by @entity207 , televised debates have affected the outcome of only two elections in the past half century -- @entity210 in 1960 and @entity211 in 2000			0
debates by the numbers both candidates had their wives in the audience at the @entity217 in @entity218 for the debate taking place on the 20th wedding anniversary of the president and first lady @entity222			0
@entity3 opened the debate by promising his wife they would n't be celebrating their anniversary next year in front of 40 million people , and @entity1 joked that @entity3 found the most romantic place possible for the anniversary			2
analysts say @entity3 needed a presidential performance rather than fireworks or haymakers in order to maintain and build on a narrow edge in polls that indicate a very close election on november 6			0
@entity1 , who has been unable to catch the president in most of the polls to date , sought to generate enthusiasm for a change in the @entity244 as the nation wrestles with seemingly chronic economic problems such as mounting federal deficits and debt			0
5 things to watch in tonight 's debate @entity43 , moderating his 12th presidential debate , planned to break up the debate into 15 - minute segments focusing on different aspects of the economy and other domestic issues			1
however , the exchanges by the candidates scrambled the format , with the opening discussion on taxes lasting more than 20 minutes			0
debate time : the candidates ' version of the two - minute drill the two candidates shook hands and shared a laugh after being introduced by @entity43 as the audience applauded before being asked to remain silent for the remainder of the debate			1
at one point , a loud bang off - stage seemed to surprise @entity1 in mid-sentence , and @entity3 looked behind him to try to see what happened			2
the other presidential debates will occur on october 16 in @entity278 and october 22 in @entity279			0
vice president @entity280 and rep. @entity281 of @entity282 , @entity1 's running mate , will debate on october 11 in @entity284			0
where they stand : the candidates and their positions @entity0 's @entity289 and @entity290 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity1 , @entity3 offer differing policies on taxes and the economy
new : a quick @entity0 / @entity77 poll says debate watchers think @entity1 won
the 90 - minute debate is first of three for the presidential contenders
