-- when @entity3 put his mind to climbing the 103 floors of @entity7 's iconic @entity6 , his legs did the rest			1
even the one that is n't human			0
the @entity11 resident scaled the skyscraper 's stairway heights on sunday thanks to what the @entity14 calls the " world 's first neural - controlled bionic leg			2
" in other words , when @entity3 thinks about going somewhere , it sends a signal to his prosthetic right leg that spurs it to move			1
this kind of technology has been implemented before in arms and fingers , but never before in a leg			0
while @entity3 , 31 , has been part of the @entity32 rehab center 's trial for about a year , this weekend 's fourth annual @entity28 fundraiser was the first public test of the technology			1
there was no guarantee he 'd successfully climb the entire skyscraper formerly known as the @entity6 , but he 'd certainly give it a shot			2
yet there he was -- 53 minutes , 9 seconds after he set off -- in the tower 's @entity7 , and seemingly on top of the world			1
' bionic blonde ' uses triathlon to take control " it was a good goal for the team to shoot for , and we hit it , " he said immediately afterward			1
this perch was a far cry from where @entity3 found himself three years earlier , in a hospital room after his leg was amputated following a motorcycle accident			1
he 'd long been a runner , competing for @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , in races like the 800 , 3,000 and 5,000 meters as well as in cross-country events			0
and now , all of a sudden , he was a patient with just one leg			0
but @entity3 took a positive turn when he teamed up with the @entity14 , which @entity63 and @entity64 ranks as the nation 's top rehab hospital			1
he became a willing human guinea pig for researchers testing the one - of - a - kind prosthetic			0
in an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity71 prior to sunday 's climb , @entity3 called the new leg " a dramatic improvement over my normal prosthetic			1
" " it 's something exciting and fun , and i hope that we push the boundaries of what the research and the leg is capable of , " he said			2
@entity83 , from the @entity7 rehab center , told @entity71 that " really advanced hardware " makes the device work			2
" we record all of the data on the computer , and then teach this small microcomputer what it looks like " as the leg moves , @entity83 adds			2
@entity3 was met with cheers as he entered the skyscraper 's front door on sunday morning , then again after he trekked up the final steps			1
he had plenty of company and fellow inspiration as he went skyward , as one of about 3,000 people making the climb and raising roughly $ 1 million for the rehab center			0
among them was @entity105 sen. @entity104 , who has worked tirelessly with the @entity14 since suffering a stroke last january			0
in his first public appearance since then , he climbed 37 flights in about an hour			0
" however bad it looks , if you or a loved one has suffered a debilitating stroke , you could be climbing the tower one day with us , " @entity104 said afterward , in comments provided by @entity14			0
" do n't give up ! " that is @entity3 's mindset as well			1
he 's happy to help the cause , and to move forward in his own life with his new prosthetic 's help			0
" it feels awesome , " he said of the leg .			0

@entity3 climbs up @entity7 's @entity6 in 53 minutes , 9 seconds
" it was a good goal for the team to shoot for , and we hit it , " he says
