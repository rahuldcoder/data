-- a @entity2 judge wednesday halted the imminent implementation of a law that threatened to shut down the state 's only abortion clinic by mandating that physicians involved in the practice have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital			1
the preliminary injunction blocks the law , @entity13 2305 , from going into effect as scheduled on thursday			2
" this is not meant to denigrate the deep and profound convictions of those who oppose abortion , but nothing can be gained by fueling the passions that drive this ' intensely divisive controversy , ' " judge @entity15 said in his ruling			2
the ruling makes @entity13 2305 the latest @entity2 law on abortion that a court has blocked in recent weeks			1
a federal judge earlier this month temporarily blocked the enforcement of a law banning abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected , which can happen as early as six weeks into a pregnancy			2
the legislation affected by wednesday 's ruling required " all physicians performing abortion procedures ( to ) have admitting privileges at a hospital located within 30 miles of the abortion facility , and staff privileges to replace hospital on - staff physicians at that hospital			2
" " these privileges must include the abortion procedures the physician will be performing at abortion facilities , " the law adds			0
as @entity15 points out , putting the law into effect would force the closure of @entity54 women 's clinic -- a place where " all abortions ... are completed long before the fetus becomes viable ( and ) are extremely safe and effective			1
" its staff , until now , had no reason to be affiliated with a local hospital , much less be approved to perform abortions at such facilities			0
the judge noted that a @entity66 hospital and a veteran 's hospital -- neither of which perform abortions -- are within the 30 - mile radius , as is one other hospital that requires doctors with admitting privileges to " generate the specified minimum volume of business			0
" early stage abortions " are relatively simple procedures , performed on an outpatient basis " in clinics without need for hospitalization , he added			0
the " old argument " that the women need to be near hospitals should " grave complications " arise has been " dispelled , " according to @entity15			0
" it is hard to envision how a compelling need for state regulation could ever exist , " the judge said			0
" in any event , the existing record clearly fails to suggest any need for the requirements imposed in @entity95			0
" @entity96 , the director of the @entity54 women 's clinic , expressed satisfaction with @entity15 's ruling and the fact that it means @entity104 " will continue to have the same rights as women across the @entity103			1
" " the judge clearly stated that these attempts to contrive safety concerns continue to be wrong - headed , and that the ( @entity2 ) constitution does include protections for women seeking abortions , " @entity96 said			1
