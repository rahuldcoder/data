-- what burns five times brighter than a full moon and flies through the air with its tail sticking out behind it ? many @entity9 residents reported seeing a meteor streaming across the saturday night sky			1
they were right , but scientists are still investigating the details , said dr. @entity14 , lead for @entity17 's @entity16			1
" this was definitely what we call a fireball , which by definition is a meteor brighter than the planet @entity27 , " he told reporters in a conference call sunday			1
" this event was so bright that it was picked up on a @entity17 meteor camera in the mountains of @entity31 over 500 miles away , which makes it extremely unusual , " he said			1
" this was a very bright event			2
" based on data from @entity17 's camera , @entity14 estimated that the meteor was at least four feet wide , weighed about 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon			1
the @entity37 has received more than 200 reports about it so far from people in various parts of the @entity9 , who reported seeing it within minutes of the same time -- 8:45 p.m. @entity43 ( 9:45 p.m. et )			1
descriptions of the fleeting flash spread rapidly on social media			0
one @entity48 user apparently caught it whizzing by on camera and posted video online			0
did any pieces of it make their way to @entity55 ? it 's possible meteorites from the fireball hit the ground , @entity14 said			1
to find out , investigators will be looking at things like weather radar data , he said			2
the @entity65 reported around 8:45 p.m. that the ground shook when a meteorite landed , the @entity63 in @entity64 said			1
where did the fireball come from ? when a piece of a comet or asteroid hurtling through space enters the @entity55 's atmosphere , pressure causes it to break apart violently in an explosion , @entity14 said			1
the fireball that @entity77 spotted saturday night could have come from the @entity79 meteor shower , which is going on right now and is known for producing bright fireballs , @entity14 said			2
it also could have been part a piece of rock from the main asteroid belt between @entity84 and @entity85 , he said			0
" we 're going to have to wait until we get more data to discriminate between the two of them , " @entity14 said			0
why did so many people notice it ? a @entity17 camera near @entity93 , @entity31 , captured an image of the sky that shows the brief , bright flash around 8:40 p.m. @entity43			1
another camera in @entity98 , @entity31 , did n't capture the event itself , but detected a change in the sky 's brightness because of the fireball			2
fireballs are n't uncommon , @entity14 said			0
thousands of them occur in the @entity55 's atmosphere each day , the @entity37 says			2
but most of them happen over oceans or uninhabited areas -- or are masked by daylight , the society says			0
" a city dweller in the @entity115 might expect to see events this bright once or twice per year , " @entity14 said			0
but depending on what time they hit , they tend to draw more attention			0
" this one was around 8:40 , so there were a lot of people outside and those events get a lot of notice , " he said			0
" there would have been far fewer reports if it happens around 3 a.m. "			0
