-- from soup kitchen director @entity5 's perspective , the notion that " homeless people are the @entity3 " has returned to her @entity8 town , which still struggles four years after @entity9			1
loaves and fishes executive director @entity5 poses with her son , @entity12 , who works at the kitchen			1
@entity5 -- formerly homeless herself -- found that " the storm was a great neutralizer			1
it put us all on the same level			2
" that social pendulum is swinging back to the pre-katrina world , she said , but she added that the community has shown a renewed sense of compassion			2
@entity5 , executive director of the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , lost her home in @entity9 as the storm barreled into the coastal community in 2005			1
she said she watched with sadness as storm victims she dubbed " amateurs " -- " people who did n't know how to be homeless " -- attempted to survive after losing everything			1
homeless people who were accustomed to living in the woods and on the streets used their wherewithal to make it through each day , said @entity5 , who relied on the kitchen 's services herself before she was hired there			1
@entity45 was one of the cities that @entity9 hit hardest			1
and though the city has made progress rebuilding , the 26 - year - old kitchen has seen steady increases in clients each year since the storm			1
with few residents in the city shortly after @entity9 , there was little activity			1
but the kitchen reports serving 55,281 meals in 2007 , 64,825 meals in 2008 and 38,877 in the first seven months of 2009			2
loaves and fishes nearly closed this summer because of lack of funding , until the public was reminded of the need to feed the hungry			1
after the @entity66 reported in late june that the kitchen could close its doors , more than $ 50,000 in donations poured in , and it is now funded until around march			2
" i certainly had never gotten that kind of response before			2
so it just made me realize that they just did n't know " about the hunger problem , @entity5 said			0
after spending time focusing on themselves and picking up the pieces , the more fortunate @entity27 residents are starting to return to a more philanthropic frame of mind , according to @entity82 manager @entity81			2
" there 's been a reawakening			0
people are getting in a closer position where they can help others , " he said			0
' hitting us with both fists ' loaves and fishes hit a " really bad financial crunch , " @entity5 said , because its federal grants for disaster relief had run out			2
she used to provide other services for the homeless , but when the money disappeared , she had to eliminate the additional assistance			2
" the economy really did n't get bad for those of us in @entity9 areas because so much money was flushed into these areas to help us get back up on our feet			1
and now those funds are gone , so the ... poor economy and the unemployment is hitting us with both fists now , " @entity5 said			0
@entity5 's clients include the expanding homeless population , day laborers , the elderly and other poor people in the area			1
@entity117 , 59 , who asked that his last name not be used , was homeless for about three years after losing his @entity120 , @entity28 , home in @entity9			1
he now rents a bedroom and regularly eats at @entity122			0
" most everyone just tries to keep to themselves right now , " @entity117 said of the atmosphere there			0
" [ we ] struggle , try and get everything back in order			0
however , the community is binding together and helping each other			0
so that 's a good thing			0
" @entity117 learned about six years ago that he had bone cancer , but only recently began receiving disability checks			0
before that , it was hard to get work despite all the @entity140 construction because outside contractors were not hiring locals , he said			0
loaves and fishes also serves down - on - their luck visitors to @entity27 's casinos			1
" a lot of people that come in here ... have gambled up their money , " @entity5 said			0
" they max out their credit cards and they get stuck here			0
" @entity27 's casinos , however , have been struggling over the past year			0
after showing signs of @entity140 growth in 2007 with more than $ 1 billion in revenue , casinos pulled in $ 951 million last year			1
they are trending down again this year , according to city data			2
but @entity159 , @entity27 's mayor , says the city celebrates new milestones of recovery daily			1
for example , the public school district has rebounded to about 4,600 students from a pre-katrina population of about 6,100 , and around 700 of 1,000 replacement homes have been built at @entity168			0
the preliminary unemployment rate in @entity120 and @entity27 for june was 7.9 percent , compared with a national rate of 9.4 percent in july			0
@entity27 's unemployment rate hit 23.2 percent the month after @entity9 , according to the @entity173 @entity172			1
this weekend , the city will break ground on $ 50 million worth of recovery , including a new library , civic center and visitor center			1
@entity159 also expects a $ 400 million infrastructure project to begin construction in january , which he hopes will put people to work and stimulate the local economy			1
he says it will take awhile for @entity27 to return to normal			0
it probably was n't until 1992 , when the casinos were established , before the city was fully rebuilt after @entity189 in 1969 , he said			2
" i think we 'll feel the effects of @entity9 for a long time , " the mayor said			1
for now , the area still struggles with poverty , homelessness and hunger , and @entity198 and @entity199 wants to be there to answer the call			0
" there 's hunger in our communities , " she said			0
" there 's not just hunger in @entity206			0
" @entity207 at @entity208 233 , @entity27 , @entity28 39522 .			0

as the city recovers from @entity9 , @entity26 and fishes sees more visitors
clientele include the homeless , day laborers , out - of - luck gamblers
" i think we 'll feel the effects of @entity9 for a long time , " mayor said
he expects to break ground on a $ 400 million infrastructure project in january
