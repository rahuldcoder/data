@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors trying to prove that @entity4 murdered his girlfriend @entity5 appeared to have won a round on tuesday morning , but it was the defense team that was smiling by the end of the day			1
tuesday 's testimony began with the expert who conducted the autopsy on @entity5 , @entity12			1
he backed two key points of the state 's case			2
he estimated that @entity5 had eaten about two hours before she died , which contradicts @entity4 ' version of events , and he said that the victim would have been able to scream after the first two bullets hit her , as the prosecution argues			1
" i think it would be somewhat abnormal if one did not scream when sustaining a wound of this nature , " @entity12 testified of the " particularly devastating " injury to @entity5 's right arm			1
a day earlier he described in graphic detail the damage that @entity4 ' bullets did to @entity5 's body , leaving the defendant vomiting , dry heaving , weeping and clutching his head in his hands			1
@entity4 , 27 , was calm in court on tuesday			1
he pleaded not guilty to murder , although he admits killing his 29 - year - old girlfriend by shooting her through a locked bathroom door			0
he mistook her for a burglar in his house in the middle of the night , he maintains , saying he made a tragic but understandable mistake			0
the prosecution is trying to build a circumstantial case that @entity4 is trigger - happy and that the couple argued before he killed her			2
@entity4 is also charged in connection with two other alleged incidents of guns going off in his hands , unrelated to the killing of @entity5			1
@entity4 ' friend @entity52 , who was present for both incidents , was on the stand for the state most of the day on tuesday			1
a furious @entity4 fired a gun from a car sunroof after a police officer handled his weapon during a traffic stop , @entity52 testified			1
@entity52 was driving the car in late 2012 when police pulled him over for speeding			2
" ( the ) officer had picked up the accused 's weapon , to which the accused said ' you ca n't just touch another man 's gun , ' " @entity52 said			1
" he was furious about it , that someone else had touched his gun , " @entity52 said			2
@entity4 later that day fired through the sunroof " out of the blue ... no warning , " he said			2
on friday , @entity4 ' ex-girlfriend @entity77 testified about the sunroof shooting incident , saying the two men laughed and joked about shooting a " robot , " a traffic light , before the gunfire			2
@entity83 denied he had been joking with @entity84 before the gun went off			0
restaurant gunshot @entity52 also testified about an incident at @entity88 , where @entity4 is accused of asking him to take the blame after he discharged @entity83 's pistol under the table one month before @entity5 's death			1
@entity52 told defense lawyer @entity92 that his written witness statement was prepared with a lawyer 's help " to make sure i was n't going to put myself into any kind of trouble , " but he insisted it was the truth			1
judge @entity99 told @entity83 he would be immune from prosecution for self - incriminating testimony if he tells the truth			0
at times tuesday @entity83 seemed evasive , insisting he did not remember what happened after dinner on the night of the sunroof incident , despite having described the day in detail up to that point			0
at other times he got testy with the acerbic @entity92 's cross-examination , saying he did not have a ruler with him when @entity92 asked how close he and @entity4 were when the gun changed hands at @entity88			1
and there were sharp intakes of breath in court toward the end of the day when @entity83 let slip that he had been following some of the trial on @entity119			0
@entity83 had volunteered on the stand that he was not wearing " tracksuit bottoms " at @entity88 because it was summer			0
@entity92 pounced , asking who had said anything about tracksuit bottoms			0
" people have said to me , ' your name 's been mentioned ; your name 's been mentioned ; your name 's been mentioned , " @entity52 said			0
" i wanted to find out what was said			0
" witnesses are not supposed to listen to the testimony of other witnesses in order to keep their testimony from being tainted			0
gun at his bedside the case against @entity4 is largely circumstantial , prosecutor @entity140 conceded in his opening statement last week			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were the only people in his house when he killed her in the early hours of @entity144 2013			1
@entity140 has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night , current and former friends of the @entity1 track star , and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots			0
defense lawyer @entity92 has gone after holes , doubts , discrepancies and inconsistencies in prosecution witness stories			2
he is trying to sow reasonable doubt that their memories of events are correct			0
many prosecution witnesses ' stories are consistent with @entity4 ' version of events , that he got up in the night , went out to his balcony to get a fan , came back inside , and heard noises in the bathroom that he thought to be an intruder			1
he said he took the gun and fired while calling for @entity5 to call the police			1
when she did n't answer he realized it could have been her in the bathroom , he said			0
@entity77 , his former girlfriend , testified friday that he reacted similarly once when she was sleeping at his house			0
she said @entity4 , the first double - amputee to run in the @entity181 , once heard something hit a bathroom window and woke her up to ask if she 'd heard it , too , before taking his gun and going to investigate			1
@entity77 said @entity4 woke her up other times when he thought he 'd heard a noise			2
@entity77 also testified that @entity4 slept with a pistol on his bedside table or on the floor beside his prosthetic legs , and he once became so angry after a traffic stop that he shot a gun through the sunroof of a car			1
prosecutors appear to have been trying to demonstrate that @entity4 and @entity5 had a loud argument before the shooting , suggesting it 's the reason he killed her			1
neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired			0
but the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was @entity5 screaming in fear for her life was in fact @entity4 when he realized what he had done			1
@entity4 and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting , allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events			1
@entity99 will decide @entity4 ' verdict			2
@entity1 does not have jury trials			0
in @entity1 , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years			0
@entity4 also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces			2
if he is n't convicted of premeditated murder , the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide , a crime based on negligence			0
the sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge 's discretion			0
the trial is expected to take at least three weeks			0
