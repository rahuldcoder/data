-- a 7 - year - old @entity2 boy adopted by an @entity4 family last year was put on a return flight to @entity6 this week because of violent and psychotic behavior , according to a @entity9 grandmother			1
the child showed up unannounced at @entity2 's child protection ministry thursday , triggering an international investigation			1
@entity2 foreign minister @entity13 told a @entity2 tv channel on friday that his country has banned future adoptions by @entity4 until the @entity4 signs a new agreement to regulate them			1
@entity4 diplomats have avoided such an agreement to set responsibilities for the adopting parents , @entity13 said , " but this latest incident has exhausted our patience			1
" " we are now investigating the circumstances of the boy 's return to see if any crimes were committed , " said @entity4 ambassador to @entity2 @entity26			1
" we are also in close contact with the @entity2 government on all aspects of the case , and we know that he is being well cared for			1
" @entity36 , the @entity9 woman who put @entity37 on the plane in @entity39 , insisted she did not abandon the child , but was following instructions from a lawyer she found online			2
@entity37 told @entity0 that she was concerned about her family 's safety after a series of violent incidents and threats			1
" i still have energy and i love children , " @entity37 said			0
" it was n't that he was just energetic and wearing us down			0
it was the violent tendencies and he had to be watched at all time			2
" when her daughter , @entity55 , adopted the boy from a @entity2 orphanage last year , she asked the doctor there if he had any physical or mental problems , @entity36 said			1
the doctor answered " ' he 's healthy , ' and turned and left , " she said			0
once the child learned enough @entity64 , he told his new family about the horrors of his previous life , including being beaten at the orphanage after his mother abandoned him , she said			1
he also told of an incident in which he burned down a building near the orphanage , she said			0
@entity2 children 's rights commissioner @entity71 said the child was " completely healthy , physically and mentally " before the adoption			1
" nobody withheld anything from her [ @entity55 ] , " he said			0
" it 's a lie			1
" @entity37 told @entity2 officials he was abused by the @entity4 family , @entity71 said			1
" there was a grandmother who was at home with the boys , " he said			0
" she used to shout at [ @entity37 ] a lot			0
when i asked how the mother treated him he burst into tears and said she used to pull his hair			0
" @entity37 said the child had a " hit list " of people he was targeting , including her daughter , who he said he " wanted to kill for the house			0
" he threatened to kill her grandson for a videogame , she said			0
the final incident that convinced @entity37 she should send the boy back to @entity2 was when she caught him starting a fire with papers in his bedroom last monday , she said			1
she feared the child might burn down the house and kill her family , she said			1
@entity37 and her family were set to meet with @entity106 , @entity9 , sheriff @entity107 on friday afternoon but their lawyer asked to reschedule the session for next week , a sheriff 's spokeswoman said			2
" i 'm not sure there 's been a crime committed , " @entity107 said earlier			0
he was asked by the @entity113 to investigate			0
a @entity113 spokesman said the @entity4 government was " very troubled " by the incident			2
" as parents , my wife and i were deeply shocked by the news of @entity37 , and very angry that any family would act so callously toward a child that they had legally adopted , " ambassador @entity26 said			2
@entity36 outlined for @entity0 the process she followed after she decided @entity37 must go back to @entity2			1
when the lawyer she found online advised her the adoption could be reversed , @entity37 booked the flight and paid the fee for a steward to escort @entity37 through the airport , she said			0
she hired a driver in @entity6 she found online to pick the child up from the @entity6 airport , she said			0
she found " safe references " for the driver online , she said			0
she then prepared a letter for @entity37 to present to @entity2 officials , which included a photo of the driver , whom she identified as " @entity140 , " she said			2
@entity37 " had never been happier " than when he boarded the plane for @entity6 , she said			0
@entity2 child protection officials were not happy when the child arrived unannounced at their ministry wednesday			1
@entity36 said when they called her there was " a lot of yelling going on			0
" but @entity37 said after the call she believed the matter was settled and the boy was safe , until she also got a call from the @entity4 embassy			2
they told her she had set off an " international incident			0
" the @entity113 spokesman on friday said it was up to the @entity2 government to decide whether it will suspend adoptions by @entity4 because of the incident			1
ambassador @entity26 said cases of neglect are rare among the " tens of thousands of adopted @entity2 children who are living happily and lovingly with their @entity4 families			1
" " but even one incident like this is too many , and we will get to the bottom of what went wrong , " he said			0
the @entity171 - based agency which @entity37 said her daughter used to coordinate the adoption said it found out about @entity37 's return only friday			2
" we were alerted to this situation by our branch office in @entity6 , @entity2 , and are shocked and saddened by this turn of events , " said a spokeswoman for the @entity177			2
in the 1 percent of the cases where the dissolution of an adoption has been needed , the agency " has always supported and worked closely with [ adoptive ] parents to assist the child in moving into a new adoptive family , " she said			1
@entity0 's @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
