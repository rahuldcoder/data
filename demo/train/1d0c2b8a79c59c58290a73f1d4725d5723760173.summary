the high court ruled in june 2006 that @entity18 was entitled to a new hearing			2
" although the issue is closed , we conclude that this is the rare case where -- had the jury heard all the conflicting testimony -- it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror viewing the record as a whole would lack reasonable doubt , " wrote justice @entity28 for the 5 - 3 majority			0
@entity18 's appeal was championed by the @entity40 , affiliated with the @entity41 in @entity42			2
" in the three years since the @entity47 @entity5 stepped into this case and sent it back to the trial court , substantial additional dna testing and further investigation have shown that he is innocent , " said @entity43 , the group 's co-director			1
