-- a minute before three o'clock on saturday , @entity1 will be scouring the stands of the @entity3 looking for dissent			1
not that his football club is used to crowd trouble			1
@entity7 play in the @entity8 , the seventh tier of @entity11 football			1
second from bottom in the division the club 's fans are in the hundreds , rather than thousands			1
but on saturday , @entity7 will do something unique : they are the only football club in @entity11 to announce that they will hold a minute 's silence for former @entity19 prime minister @entity18 -- mp for @entity21 between 1959 and 1992 -- who died of a stroke at the age of 87			1
" i do n't care if people support her or not but i do expect everyone there to behave themselves , " the 60 - year - old @entity1 , who is the club 's former chairman , told @entity0			1
this is irrelevant to politics			2
" " if anyone wants to misbehave i 'll personally go down and throw them out			2
" international grief when @entity18 's death was announced earlier this week , tributes poured in from around the world			1
@entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 ; political heavyweights one and all			2
but closer to home the eulogies were more abrasive			2
those on the right revered her as the woman that confronted the unions and " saved " the country , as current conservative prime minister @entity50 put it in a recent speech			0
those on the left lambasted her for laying waste to the industrial north , responsible for massive unemployment in football 's heartlands : @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 among others			1
two @entity64 chairman -- @entity65 of @entity66 and @entity67 of @entity68 , both of whom were also @entity71 donors -- suggested that a minute 's silence would be appropriate before this weekend 's matches			1
" we owe mrs. @entity18 a minute 's silence , " @entity65 had told the @entity74 ahead of his side 's @entity76 semifinal against @entity78 on saturday			1
" it is not my decision , it is for the @entity76 to decide , but i would be in favor of wearing an armband out of respect to @entity18			1
" but the response from the fans was furious and the @entity88 decided against it			0
" a minute silence is to mark and remember football people			1
or moments of national tragedy where all unite , say 9/11 or @entity99 , " explained @entity95 a football writer for @entity98 newspaper			2
" it was above politics			0
they have never had a minute 's silence for a political figure			1
by definition it is divisive			0
" another battleground @entity108 , @entity95 explained , had never been looked on kindly by @entity18			1
" she presided over the worst decade for [ @entity11 ] football in its history , " he said			2
" there were problems with supporters fighting			0
all that was done was to vilify and control supporters			0
she regarded football fans as the ' enemies within '			2
she wanted to batter football intro submission			2
she saw it as another area of insurrection			0
" the " enemies within " was also a phrase @entity18 used to describe the unions , the battle which perhaps more than any other defined her time in office			1
to try and curb hooligan violence at football matches , fences were erected around each pitch			2
an id card scheme for every fan , with draconian jail sentences for anyone found without one , was piloted at @entity139			0
when the heysel disaster took place at the @entity144 final between @entity61 and @entity145 , leaving 39 fans -- 32 of them @entity147 -- dead , @entity18 insisted that @entity11 teams be withdrawn from @entity150 competition			1
the ban remained for five years @entity152 but football 's nadir came four years later at @entity152			1
ninety six @entity61 fans were killed in a stadium crush during an @entity76 semifinal in 1989			0
the government and the police blamed @entity61 fans for deaths , while @entity19 tabloid newspaper @entity164 ran lurid stories of the supporter 's complicity in the tragedy , all of which were late to be found to false			2
" @entity61 was one of the few @entity19 cities that actually stood up to @entity18 and her policies			1
the city 's trade unionists and politicians were a constant source of irritation to her , " said @entity173 , the @entity174 football writer for the @entity176 newspaper			1
" she did n't get us and we most certainly did n't get her			0
the problem with that relationship is that she wielded the power and she allowed @entity61 to crumble			0
" as a child growing up in 1980s the signs of mass unemployment , urban decay and grinding poverty were everywhere			0
she could n't have cared less			0
" twenty years later @entity61 's fans were exonerated of any wrongdoing with the release of the @entity197 report			2
low safety standards and poor policing were blamed			0
the report also exposed two decades of cover ups			0
@entity202 stood in the @entity203 and apologized			0
the city never forgot the person who they saw as being ultimately in charge at the time			0
" on @entity152 , it is difficult to identify or establish exactly what role @entity18 played , if any , in the cover up that followed the disaster , " added @entity173			1
" there is evidence that came to light following the publication of the @entity197 report last september , which proves that @entity18 was not happy with the interim report from @entity220			1
" the report laid the blame where it belonged - at the door of @entity224 - and she made it clear that she was not happy about that			0
" the suspicion of the @entity152 families and their supporters is that @entity18 's involvement went beyond this			1
" @entity18 's legacy ? @entity1 sees @entity18 's influence on the game in a different way			1
he argues that @entity18 saved football from itself			1
" when you look at the 80s @entity11 football was terrorized by hooligans and derelict stadia , " he says			2
" she said , this could not continue			0
the hooligan element was destroying @entity11 football			2
" shortly after @entity152 the @entity246 's review of the tragedy changed the game forever			2
stadiums became all seater and safety was improved			0
the influx of money from @entity254 -- owned by @entity255 -- then revolutionized the game , playing a big part in turning @entity11 football in to the global entertainment product it is today , for good or ill. yet @entity1 claims the club decided to have a minute 's silence , not out of politics , but because @entity18 was a patron the club and , in one of her last acts as mp for @entity21 , helped save it from going out of business			1
humble roots @entity270 was founded in 1946 by @entity19 @entity272 soldiers returning from the @entity273			0
" the aim was to fight racism			0
initially it was anti-semitism and that changed through time to anti-discrimination , " explained @entity1			0
the club 's name derived from an eccentric @entity19 army officer called @entity283 , a pioneer in modern guerrilla warfare that trained what would become the @entity287			2
" they [ the returning soldiers ] believed the only way to increase friendship was sport , between faiths and races			2
to play against each other and with each other , " added @entity1			0
the club eventually bought their @entity299 ground			0
the @entity11 1966 @entity301 squad even trained there once before the tournament			0
when the ground was knocked down to make way for a new motorway , the club was homeless , though it had money in the bank			0
by 1991 it was mooted that the club merge with nearby @entity21 , which had a dilapidated stadium but no money			0
" it was n't important , it was essential , " said @entity1 of the merger , who was chairman at the time of @entity18 's intervention			1
" she accepted the two clubs should merge in 1991			0
and she played a major role in bringing the two clubs together and assisting us			0
she would tell us who to contact , speak to them , helped with the new lease			0
" she thought it was good idea			0
she came to the ground once			0
it was only 100 yards from her @entity21 office			0
" @entity7 are in a tiny minority			1
only two other sports teams have declared they will allow a minute 's silence before the game : top division rugby union clubs @entity336 and @entity337 , which is also found in @entity18 's old @entity21 constituency			1
" we have a sold out match and we are fairly confident that the overwhelming majority of @entity337 supporters will approve , " said @entity340 's chief executive @entity339			2
" if on saturday someone interrupts a minute 's silence , then that is democracy			1
we live in a free country , something @entity18 worked for as much as anyone to protect			1
" another minute 's silence just over an hour 's drive west of @entity21 , at exactly the same time on saturday afternoon , a very different minute 's silence will begin before @entity68 's match against @entity61 : to mark the 24th anniversary of @entity152			1
@entity355 -- the @entity68 chairman -- had suggested a minute 's silence for @entity18 too			1
" if they do hold a minute 's silence for @entity18 , i think they are making a big mistake , " said @entity357 , chair of the @entity358 , who lost her 18 year old son in the tragedy			1
" somebody fed [ @entity18 ] those lies , i think she was part of it and she knew about it			1
that 's why i feel the way i do			2
" but @entity67 backed down , realizing that silence was unlikely			2
" [ @entity152 is ] the only minute 's silence there should be this weekend , " agreed @entity61 coach @entity373			1
divine intervention @entity1 is n't sure how many will be at the @entity3 on saturday when @entity7 takes on @entity377 in their vital relegation clash			1
" maybe 500 or 600 and some away fans too , " he estimates			0
he 'll be keeping an eye out , hoping that the match will pass without intervention			0
or , at the least , not the intervention he fears			0
" we need a good three points , " said @entity1			0
" maybe we can get some divine intervention from @entity18 "			1

debate over whether a minute 's silence should be held for @entity18 before this weekend 's sporting *fixtures*
@entity64 will not insist on the tribute
@entity18 was a *controversial* figure in sport , especially football
only tiny @entity7 from @entity18 's own constituency has said it will hold a minute 's silence
