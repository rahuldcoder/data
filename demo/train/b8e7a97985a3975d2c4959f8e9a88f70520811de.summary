fourth district judge @entity8 on wednesday signed such a death warrant for @entity10 , 49			1
but the april 5 execution is not likely to happen , considering @entity10 still make can federal appeals			1

@entity15 was only the third person to die by firing squad in the @entity17 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976			1
assistant attorney general @entity19 said @entity10 , when convicted in 1989 , did not request a specific manner of execution , and was not legally entitled to die by firing squad			1
but the state did not object wednesday to @entity10 's request , although it reserves the right to ask for lethal injection , @entity19 said			1
@entity19 said there is no question of guilt in the case			2
in 1988 , according to court records , @entity10 and @entity31 met @entity33 , 28 , at a convenience store in @entity35 and rode with him to a secluded area			1
at that point , @entity33 told them he was gay , and @entity10 began to engage in a sexual act on @entity40 , but stopped			2
the two then bound @entity40 , put him in the trunk of his car and drove to another location nearly 80 miles away			2
the two attached battery jumper cables to @entity40 's testicles in a failed attempt to electrocute him			2
they inflicted blows to his head with a tire jack and iron , records show			2
a tire iron was forced inside the college student 's rectum and it punctured his liver			2
@entity40 's body was found with tire chains wrapped tightly around his neck , records show			0

@entity31 had some blood spots			0
" @entity31 received a life sentence			0
an attorney for @entity10 did not immediately return a message left by @entity76			0
but in one of three appeals , @entity10 raised questions about the competence of his previous counsel and alleged errors by the trial court			1
the @entity84 turned down that appeal in november 2011			0
according to @entity19 , after a statutory change in 2004 , lethal injection became the only available method of death in @entity2 for those who did not elect firing squad at sentencing			1
a spokesman for the @entity94 said four of the eight individuals on death row initially asked for the firing squad option at the time of their sentencing			1
@entity101 were sentenced before the 2004 law change			0
in @entity2 , five anonymous marksmen , each with a matching .30 - caliber rifle , are used in firing squads			1
they stand behind a wall cut with two gunports , said corrections spokesman @entity108			0
one of the rifles will hold an " ineffective " round , similar to a blank , which delivers the same recoil as a live round			0
the marksmen fire from a distance of 25 feet			0
the inmate is blindfolded and strapped to a chair with a target pinned to his chest .			0
