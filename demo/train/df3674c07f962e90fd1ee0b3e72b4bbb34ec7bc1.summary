@entity0 -- in the wake of the @entity6 nuclear disaster a year ago , the attitude toward food safety has become a matter of personal preference for many @entity0 residents			1
after an earthquake - triggered tsunami engulfed the @entity14 nuclear plant in northeastern @entity10 , setting off the most serious radiation scare since the 1986 @entity17 accident , @entity10 is still struggling to build a centralized radiation - detection system , leading to difficulty in measuring radiation and ambiguous safety guidelines			1
for some consumers , this means checking for food labels that indicate food is safe			2
others still avoid certain fish or agricultural products from northern @entity10			1
some residents still take food to radiation monitoring stations to ensure safety			1
but many consumers have gone back to eating much like they were before the disaster			2
@entity35 , a 22 - year - old service - industry worker , employed a cautious approach to radiation exposure immediately following the disaster			1
" i tried not to get wet when it rained , and when i bought vegetables , i always made sure of where they came from , " he says			0
these days he does n't pay that much attention			2
" it 's been some time , " he says			0
" i do n't see much point in doing it now			2
" for the owner of the 60 - year - old shop and wedding catering business @entity50 at the @entity52 , the concern is business not health			0
" one of the food products i sell is yakidai ( grilled snapper ) , fish used for special occasions like weddings , " he said			2
" there were many requests made by my clients not to use the fish from eastern @entity10			1
" in response to food - safety concerns , the government has been stepping up efforts to assure people of the safety of @entity10 's agricultural products			1
radiation monitoring centers have been set up in certain prefectures to identify and restrict the consumption of contaminated foods			2
but getting yes - or - no answers is not easy			0
" absolute values are very hard to measure , " says @entity79 , director of @entity80 at @entity81 , a non-profit organization that collects and shares radiation measurements			2
" you have to decide for yourself , what do i believe and what do n't i believe			1
" " for many people it 's very confusing , " says @entity79			0
" there are more questions than answers to this thing			0
" @entity10 exports dropped sharply in the months after the march 11 disaster amid global concerns about radiation in its food products			1
@entity100 exports to @entity101 dropped from nearly 1,400 tons to zero in a matter of two months			2
authorities have gone to great lengths to point out that the country 's food products are safe			2
government press releases report that no @entity10 exports have failed radiation screening by any importing countries , and that cities like @entity112 and @entity113 are in fact more radioactive than @entity0			1
@entity115 also plummeted 70 % on radiation fears immediately following the disaster			1
tourism is still below year - ago levels , but the 700,000 tourists that arrived in january represented only a 4.5 % decrease from the same month in 2011 , the @entity118 said in february			0
the government has picked the anniversary of the disaster to unveil its new " @entity10			1
" campaign to give an added boost to a tourism industry still in recovery			0
some tourists , like @entity131 law student @entity130 , have n't given much thought to possible radiation contamination			1
@entity130 says he does n't mind eating food that others shun , " because it will be delicious and cheap			1
" but for many @entity0 residents , the concern is still strong enough that they take their food to radiation - measuring stations set up around @entity0			1
however , checking food for radiation is not cheap			1
" we have around five to seven customers a day come and check their food for a fee of Â ¥ 3,500 ( $ 42 ) , " says @entity143 , a member of @entity144 , a non-profit organization that sets up stations around @entity0 to test for radiation in food			1
" they will ask many questions like , ' is it okay to eat this one ? ' " he acknowledges that it is not an exact science			0
" we can not answer clearly			0
" @entity81 's @entity79 agrees			0
" the government has made specific recommendations , but people do n't really know what to do with those , they want a second opinion , " he says			1
@entity79 , who has a nine - year - old child , says his wife takes location into account when buying food for the family , purchasing products from the south of @entity10 in general , and mineral water from @entity171			1
" you can debate if it 's logical or not , but that 's what we do , " he says			0
the owner of @entity178 thinks it 's time to stop worrying			0
" the government has been testing the food , " he says , and he thinks it 's safe			1
as for himself , " i am very old			0
unlike young people , i have fewer things to worry about			0
" @entity35 , the 22 - year - old service - industry worker who used to check the origin of his vegetables , has also moved on			0
" you can not live forever in fear , " he says			0
as he lines up outside a sushi restaurant at the @entity52 with his girlfriend , @entity193 , a student who turns 20 on march 11 , it is n't the anniversary of the disaster that is foremost on his mind			2
it 's treating his girlfriend to a birthday meal of sushi			0
" she wanted good food			0
so i decided to take her here			0

@entity10 still has n't built a central radiation detection system after the nuclear disaster
some @entity0 residents still have their food checked at radiation monitors in the city
the @entity10 government notes that no @entity10 exports have failed radiation screenings
