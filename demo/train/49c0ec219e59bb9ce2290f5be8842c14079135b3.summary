-- gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people around the world -- and many of their allies -- are protesting the @entity6 in @entity7 because of @entity9 's anti-gay law , which basically criminalizes pro-gay speech or propaganda			1
as a lesbian , and yes , one who has been known from time to time to propagandize ( i.e. , write and talk ) about how gay people are equal in every sense imaginable to straight folks -- and should be treated as such -- i feel the @entity9 law is unthinkably inhumane and offensive			1
and as far as i 'm concerned , it 's a reason to boycott the @entity7 games and ostracize @entity9 on the world stage in general			1
and so you can imagine my surprise in discovering that the @entity7 have featured moments filled with gay symbolism			1
and we 're only a few days in			0
the pretend lesbians who sang and held hands at @entity31 the @entity9 band @entity33			1
made waves several years ago when they skyrocketed to fame as a young - @entity9 - lesbians - in - love pop duo followed by the revelation that the stars of the band were actually heterosexual and merely staged the gay thing to get attention			1
nonetheless , @entity33 's @entity42 and @entity43 achieved pseudo-gay icon status in @entity9 and beyond			1
so it was a big deal when they performed at the @entity7 opening ceremony and held hands , hopefully a subtle form of protest causing @entity9 president @entity51 to clutch his pearls			1
@entity55 chairman 's speech about tolerance and diversity @entity58 , the chairman of the @entity55 , gave a speech at the opening ceremonies , as such chairpeople usually do			2
if you watched the speech on @entity63 , you might have missed the most important part , which @entity63 claims it edited out because of time , not politics			0
in the cut portion , @entity58 says : " this is the @entity69 message the athletes spread to the host country and to the whole world			1
yes , it is possible to strive even for the greatest victory with respect for the dignity of your competitors			0
yes , yes , it is possible -- even as competitors -- to live together under one roof in harmony , with tolerance and without any form of discrimination for whatever reason			0
yes , it is possible -- even as competitors -- to listen , to understand and to give an example for a peaceful society			0
" intentional or not , it was a mistake for @entity63 to edit out that very important part			0
this political point needed making			0
the @entity93 bobsled team posted what ? four men			0
wearing nothing but their underwear			0
crammed into a phallic - shaped bobsled to pose for a photo			2
for the record ( and for my lawyer ) , i 'm not saying the @entity93 @entity107 team is gay			2
i am saying this picture is			0
@entity110 's one blade crusade @entity112 's speed skater @entity110 is one of a handful of openly gay athletes competing in @entity7			1
@entity110 was able to afford to go to the @entity6 thanks to fundraising support from the gay community worldwide and now that he 's there , he 's working extra hard to represent			1
he 's got his own pin			2
and this week , @entity110 won the internet with this tweet : here 's hoping @entity110 gets the chance			0
i 'm leaving out the uniforms and gloves that , apparently coincidentally , feature the rainbow colors used to signify gay pride around the world , the campiness of figure skating uniforms -- the idea of de-gayed figure skating is so laughable that ' @entity139 " parodied the idea in its pre-sochi cold open imagining " @entity135 " -- and the all - male choir in uniforms that could belong to the @entity138 singing about getting lucky			1
but this one is priceless			0
because there 's only so much fabulousness you can fit in one essay , and i simply had to make room for this			0
thank you , @entity148 this did n't happen at @entity7 but is sure inspired by it and is by far the most awesome thing ever so i 'm including it here			1
the @entity93 put out this video as a giant homoerotic rebuttal to @entity51 and discrimination in @entity9			2
it is a wonder to behold			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : the @entity69 at @entity7 have been pretty *flamboyant* so far
@entity160 : despite @entity9 's anti-gay law , there were many gay - *ish* moments
