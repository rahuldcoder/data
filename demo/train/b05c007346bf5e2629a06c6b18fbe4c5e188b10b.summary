our minds still try to resist the idea that someone is willing to kill another human being because of the words that he or she writes			2
yet that is exactly what happened to @entity10 , an @entity11 citizen hacked to death by men brandishing knives and machetes during a trip to his native @entity17			1
@entity10 and his wife , @entity19 , now in critical condition after also being attacked thursday , were in @entity17 to attend the national book fair , where @entity10 was promoting his books advocating tolerance , education and secular humanism			1
why was he killed ? at the time of writing , the perpetrators had not been caught , but there seems little doubt he was killed by @entity32 radicals , who were likely angered by his devastatingly critical writings			1
just last month he wrote about the @entity35 killings in @entity36 and the december 16 massacre in @entity38 , @entity39 , in which @entity39 @entity40 opened fire inside a school , killing 145 people , including 132 children			2
" to me , " he wrote , " such religious extremism is like a highly contagious virus			1
" @entity10 strongly disagreed with president @entity49 's statements distancing the so - called @entity50 from @entity51			1
" @entity58 , " he said , " is what unfolds when the virus of faith launches into action and the outbreak becomes an epidemic			2
" his assassination came the same day we learned the identity of the man known as @entity63 , infamous for narrating in @entity64 as @entity66 hostages of @entity58 were decapitated			2
he has been identified as the @entity69 - raised , university educated @entity67			1
taken together , these two tragedies help shed light on what motivates people to conduct these brutal acts			2
the revelations about @entity67 's life story were pieced together with the help of an organization that wants to make us believe @entity63 's radicalization is the fault of the @entity83 security services , not of a murderous , apocalyptic ideology that helped make 2014 the deadliest year for terrorist attacks on record			2
according to the @entity87 , which relies partly on information from a group called cage , @entity67 was described by some as a perfectly normal young @entity69 , showing no signs of becoming the barbaric murderer he is alleged to have become , until security services started harassing him			2
the problems began , friends referred to in the article would have us believe , when he tried to go on safari to @entity101 with a couple of friends			2
he was stopped in @entity101 , and according to the article , he claims he was accused of planning to travel to @entity105 , where the @entity107 affiliate @entity106 has been conducting its reign of terror			0
an official from cage , which is described by the @entity87 as a " rights group , " described @entity67 as " extremely kind , extremely gentle , " before @entity83 's @entity111 started making his life hell for no apparent reason other than that he was a @entity115			0
it is a misleading interpretation of events , one seemingly aimed at furthering the alleged agenda of cage			0
indeed , reports suggest that the security services had reason to believe @entity67 was already engaged in supporting @entity105 's @entity106 before his troubles began			0
any " harassment " he experienced therefore seems more likely to have been because he was regarded as a threat			0
and that reality seems to get at a very real truth in all this -- people who decapitate journalists , or who hack to death bloggers , or who massacre @entity134 , or set on fire fellow @entity137 do n't do it because the authorities in @entity69 were n't kind enough toward them			0
and the blame for the acts of murderous extremism we are seeing can not be laid at the door of poverty , lack of jobs or @entity150 prejudice			1
as @entity10 so accurately pointed out , and as his death tragically demonstrates , the culprit is an apocalyptic , ultra-extremist ideology that religiously justifies every atrocity as it seeks to intimidate its foes and impose its vision			1
meanwhile , claims that the " root causes " of @entity32 extremism lie in unemployment or prejudice simply serve to derail the campaign to eradicate it			1
of course , unemployment and prejudice are ills that must be fought			0
but they are not what is getting bloggers like @entity165 -- hacked to death in the streets of @entity168 in 2013 -- killed			1
and it is not just atheists who are at risk , something that most @entity137 fully understand ; these extremists are just as likely to target a @entity134 , a moderate @entity137 , or anyone else who wants to live in the modern world or who disagrees with their extremist ideas			0
still , as an outspoken atheist , @entity10 knew that his views were putting his life in danger			1
he wrote about how last year , at the same @entity168 book fair , his book " @entity184 " quickly rose to the top of the fair 's best - seller list			1
it was enormously popular , but also " hit the cranial nerve of @entity51 fundamentalists			0
" that 's when the death threats started pouring in across social media			0
" i suddenly found myself a target of militant islamists and terrorists , " he wrote			0
in 2014 , local media reported on some of the threats coming out of a local college known as a stronghold of politicized religious extremists			0
one @entity205 post read " @entity10 lives in @entity11 and so it is not possible to kill him right now			1
he will be murdered when he comes back			0
" and so he was			0
the @entity32 group @entity207 - 7 reportedly tweeted after @entity10 's killing , " @entity209 here in @entity17			1
" @entity10 was right about where the threat lies : in a dangerous ideology that takes religious teachings to their most extreme interpretation			1
he was working to counteract its effects , to open minds			0
and he understood the one thing that can be so difficult for the rest of us to fully comprehend : that there are people prepared to kill someone else just because of what they believe or what they write			0
nothing could be more dangerous to a society , and to the basic rights of all human beings			0
@entity10 's tragic death is the latest reminder of that .			1
