@entity0 -- two steps forward , one step back			1
a surge of optimism on monday for a possible compromise to end the partial government shutdown and avoid a @entity8 default as soon as this week got jolted by the sudden postponement of a @entity11 meeting between president @entity12 and congressional leaders			1
in a brief statement , the @entity11 said the meeting announced earlier in the day was put on hold " to allow leaders in the @entity19 time to continue making important progress " toward a solution			1
it was unclear if the development signaled a problem or was needed to give more time for talks between senate majority leader @entity27 and his @entity29 counterpart , @entity28 , to finish an agreement that could win approval in the @entity19 and the @entity11			1
7 crazy side effects from the shutdown negotiations heated up with the @entity36 and @entity29 leaders signaling progress			1
both @entity27 and @entity38 took to the @entity19 floor to express optimism for a compromise on the twin priorities that they expected to be reasonable and acceptable to both sides			2
@entity27 's tone remained positive as night fell over the @entity46			0
" we 've made tremendous progress , " he said , saying that " everyone just needs to be patient " and that " perhaps tomorrow will be a bright day			0
" key negotiators also maintained an upbeat posture and financial markets , which @entity0 is watching very closely considering their volatility over the political impasse , also ended the day higher with @entity55 heartened by news of a possible deal , especially on the debt limit			1
at the same time , both sides noted that nothing had been finalized and the postponement of the meeting between congressional leaders and @entity12 and vice president @entity64 raised a new question mark in the process			1
supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown during a visit monday to a local food pantry , @entity12 cited progress in the @entity19 negotiations but also warned of what he called continued partisan brinkmanship by @entity76 who " continue to think that somehow they can extract concessions by keeping the government shut down or by threatening default			1
" " my hope is a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours , " @entity12 said			2
shutdown drags on the failure of @entity88 to authorize spending for the new fiscal year triggered the shutdown on october 1			0
another deadline looms on thursday , when the @entity93 says it will need @entity88 to raise the debt ceiling so it can borrow more money to pay all the government 's bills			1
during his visit to @entity99 in @entity0 , @entity12 said the congressional leaders could " solve this problem today			1
" the crisis with an on / off switch he warned that a default , in which the government would lack enough cash on hand to pay down its debt obligations as well as other daily bills such as @entity114 checks , " could have a potentially devastating effect on our economy			0
" " we 've already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown , " he said			0
" that damage would be greatly magnified if we do n't make sure that government 's paying its bills , and that has to be decided this week			0
" the @entity93 said it will be unable to pay the government 's bills unless the debt limit is increased by thursday			2
as reported by @entity1 's @entity125 and @entity1 senior white house correspondent @entity126 , the main sticking point involves how long an agreement would fund the government to end the shutdown and increase the debt limit			0
@entity36 want the debt ceiling increase to extend as long as possible to avoid similar showdowns in coming months			1
conservatives defiant in the face of @entity29 troubles at the same time , they seek a temporary spending plan to reopen the government while formal budget negotiations work out a longer - term agreement that can negate the impacts of the forced sequestration cuts			2
republicans , however , want a longer spending proposal that would lock in the planned sequestration cuts in coming months , with a shorter debt ceiling extension in order to negotiate further deficit - reduction measures			1
sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , and moderate @entity29 sen. @entity150 of @entity151 have spearheaded the bipartisan talks			2
separately , @entity153 sen. @entity153 of @entity154 also cited progress			0
" we 'll get this done			0
we 're gon na get this done			0
i feel real confident , " @entity148 said			0
@entity148 said the goal was to get at least 65 @entity19 votes -- which would mean 10 or more from @entity29 -- to help speaker @entity161 generate @entity29 backing in the @entity11 despite certain opposition from the @entity165 conservative wing			1
@entity148 said @entity27 and @entity38 must work out specifics			0
the two party leaders met twice in the morning and early afternoon , and they offered their optimistic assessments after their second face - to - face discussion			0
@entity161 also dropped by @entity38 's office to get an update on the talks , his aide confirmed			0

details of proposal fluid @entity36 sources told @entity181 and @entity1 's @entity182 that the proposal under consideration by @entity27 and @entity38 would fund the government through january 15 , allowing it to reopen for at least three months or so			1
at the same time , negotiations on a budget for the full fiscal year would have a deadline of some time in december , the sources said			0
meanwhile , the debt ceiling would be increased through february 7 to put off the threat of default for almost four months , according to sources in both parties			1
the budget negotiations were expected to address deficit reduction measures and therefore could impact when the debt limit would need to be increased again			2
@entity199 steps into budget fight in addition , provisions involving @entity12 's signature health care reforms could be included , such as strengthening verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the @entity209 , the sources said			2
another possible change to the health care reforms would delay a fee on employers , unions and other plan sponsors that raise money to compensate insurance companies for taking on high - risk customers in the early years of @entity219			2
@entity1 political analyst @entity220 said monday that @entity36 wanted to press what they perceive as an advantage over @entity29 on how the public is perceiving the latest round of @entity0 budget and deficit brinkmanship			1
" what 's behind it ( are ) poll numbers that saw @entity29 getting their butt kicked because of this whole gamesmanship , " @entity220 said			0
mindful that the thursday debt deadline is days away , @entity11 @entity29 leaders are considering all their options even as @entity29 and @entity36 @entity19 leaders try to craft a deal on the debt ceiling , said a @entity29 leadership aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity			1
