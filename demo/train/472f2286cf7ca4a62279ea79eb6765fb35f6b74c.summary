-- a month after a devastating earthquake sent a wall of water across the @entity7 landscape , the global terrain of the atomic power industry has been forever altered			1
the ongoing drama at the power plant in @entity10 -- a name now ranked alongside @entity12 and @entity13 as history 's worst nuclear accidents -- has erased the momentum the nuclear industry has seen in recent years			2
the growth in the emerging world , such as @entity20 and @entity21 , fueled increased demand in planned reactors			0
oil - rich regions like the @entity25 and smaller nations like @entity27 announced plans to build nuclear reactors in the past year			2
once the bane of environmentalists , the nuclear industry enjoyed newfound " green " credentials as a cleaner alternative to coal - fired plants that belch greenhouse gases to produce electricity			2
before @entity10 , a " nuclear renaissance " -- as it was termed in the press -- seemed well underway , except for this point : nuclear power , as a total of world energy supply , has been in steady decline for the past decade			1
from 2000 to 2008 , nuclear energy dropped from 16.7 % to 13.5 % of global energy production , according to the @entity47			1
the 2010 - 11 preliminary report , expected to be released wednesday , will show the downward trend has continued , according to study author @entity50			2
while nuclear energy production has steadily increased , its piece of the global electricity pie is shrinking compared to traditional sources such as coal and alternatives like wind and solar power			1
" this does n't indicate there is a nuclear revival , " said @entity60 , one of the architects of @entity21 's atomic strategy and a fellow at the @entity64 in @entity65			2
" had @entity10 happened two years later , the renaissance may have been underway			0
but if ( the nuclear industry ) was hoping for a real revival , you can safely say this wo n't happen now			2
" political fallout the shockwaves from the @entity10 plant disaster shook @entity78 politics , which could have economic implications far beyond the nuclear industry as @entity78 -- the largest economy in @entity82 -- attempts to steer the eurozone out of its debt crisis			2
chancellor @entity88 's @entity87 suffered a historic loss to the @entity90 during a key state election in @entity92 , a traditional stronghold for @entity88 's party			0
the elections came two weeks after the @entity7 disaster and the defeat was attributed in large part to nuclear fears in the wake of @entity10 and @entity88 's pro-nuclear credentials			2
( @entity88 temporarily shut down seven of the nation 's 17 reactors and talked about an " exit strategy " from nuclear power in the week between the @entity7 temblor and the state elections ; critics accused @entity88 of flip - flopping to reflect a shift in opinion away from nuclear power			1
) the political hot potato playing out in @entity78 can be expected elsewhere as aging reactors come up for extension of licenses or replacement in the @entity117 , the @entity118 and @entity7			2
the average age of the world 's 443 nuclear reactors is 25 years , according to the @entity47			2
" in the next 10 years , nuclear power will face enormous public pressure in large democracies like the @entity117 and @entity21 , " said @entity60 , a nuclear energy proponent			1
@entity20 , by far , has the largest number of plants planned with 27 reactors currently under construction , followed by 11 in @entity130 , and five apiece in @entity21 and @entity131 , according to the @entity132 ( @entity132 )			0
@entity133 announced that @entity20 would temporarily suspend construction of new plants pending review of the @entity10 incident , but few analysts believe @entity20 will scuttle planned reactors			0
" the countries that are going to do big builds ... have said loudly and clearly , we are not backing down from nuclear energy , " said @entity140 of the @entity141 , a group for nuclear industry professionals			1
fear factor nuclear power has had an uphill climb in public perception since the 1945 explosions over @entity151 at the end of @entity153 first put the word " atomic " onto headlines across the globe			1
" radiation in particular is a scary thing -- we ca n't see , we ca n't touch it , you ca n't look at the ground and know its there , " said @entity140 , a former vice president of engineering at @entity157 who now advises companies on nuclear industry issues			0
" ( nuclear power ) gets conflated in people 's minds with weapons , " @entity140 said			1
" the fact that the first controlled nuclear plants were to run submarines and other military secrets , there is a web of secrecy as to what you can talk about , which adds to the mystique			0
" while the devastation in @entity10 is " horrible , " @entity140 and other nuclear proponents argue that nuclear crises are n't being judged by the same yardstick as other -- and statistically more deadly -- industrial disasters			0
" look at @entity189 : thousands of people died there -- did people walk away from chemical engineering ? " said @entity140 , referring to the 1984 @entity188 chemical plant disaster in @entity21			0
there were no deaths at the 1979 @entity12 crisis in the @entity117 a 2005 report from the @entity197 said as many as 4,000 people may die of radiation exposure from the @entity13 in @entity130 , although fewer than 50 deaths were directly attributed to the disaster			0
" the numbers do n't lie , coal kills millions every year " through air pollution , said @entity202 , head of the @entity203 , a think tank that aims to modernize liberal thought , at @entity207 's @entity206 conference last week in @entity208			0
@entity206 nukes when @entity140 moved to @entity208 in 1981 , the young nuclear engineer attended a meeting of the @entity215 , the environmental group			0
" when they found out what i did , they kicked me out , " @entity140 recalled			0
in the past decade , however , many environmentalists have embraced nuclear power as a better alternative than coal and gas - fired plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions			1
@entity226 , for example , gets 75 % of its power from nuclear plants -- the highest ratio in the world , according to the @entity132			1
by comparison , the @entity117 gets just under 20 % of its power from nuclear , although it has the most reactors in operation -- 104 reactors , nearly double the number in @entity226			1
" @entity226 's advance in terms of nuclear and hydraulic energy generation ( allows ) the country to maintain its emissions at the same level as they were in 1990 , " said @entity237 , a spokesperson for @entity226 energy giant @entity238			1
still , the early promise of nuclear energy as a cheap , clean form of energy has never materialized			1
costs of nuclear power plants can be as high as $ 10 billion , according to a 2010 report by the @entity253 at @entity254 in @entity255			1
the average construction time is seven years , but with licensing approval new builds often take a decade , @entity50 said			0
what 's the alternative ? alternative energy production is faster and cheaper , @entity50 said			0
" in the @entity117 in 2004 , 2 % of all new power produced that year came from alternative energy sources ... by 2009 , 55 % of all new power was from alternatives , " @entity50 said			1
" there 's no way nuclear could add that much , that fast			0
" nuclear power reactors are dependent on government subsidies and loan guarantees to be built , cover costs in case of accidents and assume long - term responsibility for storage of spent radioactive fuel , critics say , which artificially lowers the cost of production			1
" these plants are 30 - year investments -- it 's hard to get the market interested in more than two - year investments , and loan guarantees are not a subsidy , " countered @entity140 of the @entity141			0
government backing of insurance in case of disasters has resulted because " the nuclear industry has had so few accidents , there is no actuarial for insurance companies on which to offer an insurance policy , " she added			0
market reaction has been swift against the nuclear industry after the @entity10 disaster			2
companies on the @entity301 rose on average 17 % in the wake of the disaster , while companies on the @entity305 fell 8.7 %			1
" we expect a number of impacts from the public and political backlash against nuclear , which could mean the focus switches to renewables , " an @entity307 report said in march			1
still , no one expects the industry to fade			0
the @entity117 , @entity7 , @entity131 , @entity130 and @entity226 have significant nuclear industries with important strategic as well as economic interests , analysts say			1
" no one is going to walk away , " @entity140 said			0
" if the @entity117 wants to be a leader in this technology , they 've got to be playing in this technology			0

nuclear power dropped from 16.7 % to 13.5 % of global energy from 2000 to 2008
firms on the @entity305 fell 8.7 % after the disaster ; renewables rose 17 %
@entity238 : 75 % of @entity226 power is nuclear , keeping carbon emissions to 1990 levels
