-- the @entity2 bankruptcy case is acting as a @entity4 test for so many challenges that bedevil older industrial cities in the @entity7 and beyond			1
a common one : how do older cities rocked by deindustrialization and the loss of population and jobs redefine their economic function and find a new reason to live in a shifting global economy ? the experiences of @entity17 and @entity18 offer cause for hope and a roadmap for reinvention and renewal			1
with the collapse of the steel industry in the early 1980s , the @entity17 metro area endured the loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in just three years ; the city 's population declined by almost 12.7 % during the full decade			1
fast forward 30 years , and it is clear that the city and broader metropolis have regained their footing through a series of strategic and sustained interventions			0
smart public , private and civic leadership has helped diversify the economy toward health care and technology , building off a solid base of advanced research institutions and medical campuses ( " eds and meds " ) , such as @entity47 and the @entity48			1
smart urban regeneration tactics have successfully repurposed waterfront locations , historic buildings and even brown - field sites into new walkable places valued by innovative firms and talented workers			0
an impressive 25 % of the jobs in the @entity17 metro area are within three miles of the central business district , compared with just 7 % in @entity2			1
with such employment density , reasonable housing costs and ample cultural amenities , the city now routinely places at or near the top of worldwide livability rankings			0
@entity18 -- which spans the four metropolitan areas of @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 -- provides a more recent example of renewal			2
in the early 2000s , the @entity71 chronicled the " quiet crisis " that was gradually bleeding the region of people , jobs and vitality			0
in response , philanthropic institutions pooled their resources and supported a series of institutions and intermediaries , including the @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , to identify precisely the region 's untapped potential in emerging technology , health care , energy and manufacturing clusters and then help small - and medium - sized firms meet the demand for new products and services			1
as in @entity17 , these efforts leveraged @entity18 's stellar network of advanced research institutions and medical campuses , many of which ( e.g. , the @entity101 ) sit at the cores of the region 's central cities			1
the result in less than a decade has been impressive : an additional 10,500 jobs , $ 333 million in payroll , $ 1.9 billion in investments , including the first nationally designated additive manufacturing institute in @entity68			0
the examples of @entity17 and @entity18 provide a road map for the renewal not only of @entity2 but of older industrial cities more generally			1
robocop creator : @entity116 shows the film 's fictional future is upon us first , form and sustain a network			2
cities and metropolitan areas are powerful because they are networks -- of corporate , philanthropic , university , community and government institutions and leaders			2
each element of the network is not big enough or rich enough to power economic restructuring			0
but , taken together , they have the potential to design and deliver transformative initiatives and interventions			2
second , set a distinctive vision for economic growth grounded in your region 's special assets and advantages			0
@entity142 was right ; what 's past is prologue			0
@entity18 , for example , shows how specialties designed for car manufacturing can be repurposed			2
as @entity66 's tire making industry declined , companies working with local universities shifted their focus and research efforts into the related business of polymers			0
the @entity155 now makes polymers and plastics that can be used in clean energy and biotech			0
third , find the series of game changers that have the potential to create jobs in the near term and alter the trajectory of your economy over the long haul			2
in @entity17 and @entity18 , the signature game changer has been collaboration -- among companies , universities , entrepreneurs and supportive institutions -- to help reshape the economy and create a sense of place and to grow quality jobs in quality places			1
the revival of @entity2 is not a fanciful dream ; in fact it has already begun			1
according to research in progress by the @entity185 and @entity186 , @entity2 's historic downtown and midtown core is 3 percent of the city 's land mass but home to 37 percent of its jobs , and residential and business growth is underway			1
this growth includes new corporate residents like @entity197 bringing over 7,000 new jobs downtown since 2007 , and older anchor institutions like @entity200 , @entity201 and the @entity202 driving over $ 1.8 billion in investments to midtown over the past decade			0
this resurgence of @entity2 's core builds off the physical " bones " ( such as historic buildings , revised riverfront ) of the city and the enviable assets in the broader metropolis , including a relatively high concentration of workers in @entity214 ( science , technology , engineering and math ) fields , given the region 's concentration in advanced manufacturing			1
and the resurgence is stewarded by the leadership of re-energized networks of philanthropies like the @entity227 , as well as the work of capable institutions like the @entity230 , @entity2 and @entity116			2
with such advantages , now is the time to revive the city from the core and set ambitious goals for housing , job and fiscal growth that benefits all residents			0
@entity116 's future , in short , is still to be written			0
private , civic , and , yes , public investors like the federal government must double down on this momentum , and invest in that future to make it a bright one			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 and @entity249			1

@entity248 , @entity249 : revival in @entity18 , @entity17 should give hope to @entity2
they say after steel 's collapse , @entity17 diversified economy based on ' eds and meds '
they say in @entity18 , philanthropies pooled resources to tap into cities ' potential *strengths*
writers : some of these strategies already underway in @entity2 ; story 's not over yet
