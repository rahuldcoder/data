-- demonstrations in support of immigrants ' rights are scheduled saturday in at least 21 states , the @entity6 and two @entity8 provinces			1
in all , protests are planned for 47 cities			1
the demonstrations come amid a swirl of controversy surrounding a new immigration law in @entity14 that allows police to demand proof of legal residency			1
@entity14 lawmakers say the law is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce border security with @entity22 , allowing more than 450,000 illegal immigrants to move into in the state			1
critics say the law is unconstitutional and will lead to racial profiling , which is illegal			1
but @entity14 gov. @entity28 and others who support @entity30 say it does not involve profiling or other illegal acts			1
the @entity14 legislature passed a series of changes to the law late thursday in an attempt to address the accusations that the measure will lead to profiling			1
the law , which does not go into effect for 90 days , has already drawn at least two lawsuits and condemnation from the @entity22 government and other @entity47 nations			1
prominent entertainers , including @entity49 and @entity50 , also have spoken out against the law			1
some critics are calling for a boycott of @entity14 , urging that tourists stay away and that no one do business with companies in the state			1
on friday , two @entity60 , @entity61 , officials wrote a three - page letter to @entity64 commissioner @entity63 to ask that the 2011 all - star game be moved from @entity66 , @entity14 , if the law is not repealed			1
the @entity68 , the players ' union , is also voicing its disapproval of the law			1
" the recent passage by @entity14 of a new immigration law could have a negative impact on hundreds of @entity64 players who are citizens of countries other than the @entity80 , " @entity72 , executive director of the association , said in a prepared statement friday			1
" these international players are very much a part of our national pastime and are important members of our association			1
their contributions to our sport have been invaluable , and their exploits have been witnessed , enjoyed and applauded by millions of @entity80			0
all of them , as well as the clubs for whom they play , have gone to great lengths to ensure full compliance with federal immigration law			1
... " the @entity68 opposes this law as written			1
we hope that the law is repealed or modified promptly			1
if the current law goes into effect , the @entity68 will consider additional steps necessary to protect the rights and interests of our members			1
" also friday , @entity107 president @entity106 announced that the civil rights organization is suspending consideration of @entity66 -- which had submitted a bid -- as the location for its 2012 conference " as long as this unfortunate law remains in effect			1
" " the law is repugnant not just to people of color but to all @entity80 who value fairness , decency , and justice , " said @entity106 , who added that no site in the state would be considered unless the law is repealed or overturned			1
the organization is expected to announce the winning location for the convention at its 2010 conference in late july			0
in addition , the @entity128 fraternity announced it is pulling its july 2010 convention from @entity66 and moving it to @entity131 , @entity132 , because of what its board called " the egregious immigration act signed recently by the governor of @entity14			1
" " it was the full opinion of the board that we could not host a meeting in a state that has sanctioned a law which we believe will lead to racial profiling and discrimination , and a law that could put the civil rights and the very dignity of our members at risk during their stay in @entity66 , @entity14 , " the fraternity 's board said			1
though perhaps not as vocal , the law also has plenty of supporters			1
some have launched a " @entity156 , " in which they urge people to spend money in the state to support the measure			1
backers applaud @entity14 legislators for taking seriously their concerns about illegal immigration and crime			2
@entity14 's new law requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and mandates that police question people if there is reason to suspect they 're in the @entity80 illegally			1
the measure makes it a state crime to live in or travel through @entity14 illegally			0
it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them			0
@entity28 signed the law last week , and the legislature changed some language in it thursday night in an attempt to make it less ambiguous as to how and when people can be questioned about their residency			2
@entity28 signed the changes into law friday , saying they will ease concerns about racial profiling			1
according to the bill the governor signed april 23 , police would be able to detain an individual based merely on the suspicion that he or she entered the country illegally			0
a change that legislators approved thursday night , however , says police could check on residency status only while enforcing some other law or ordinance			2
an officer could ask about an immigrant 's status , for example , while investigating that person for speeding , loitering or some other offense			2
in addition , the law says @entity14 's attorney general or a county attorney can not investigate complaints based " solely " on factors such as a person 's race , color or national origin			1
the changes that legislators approved thursday night would remove the word " solely , " to emphasize that prosecutors must have some reason other than an individual 's race or national origin to investigate			2
read the full text of @entity30 ( @entity226 ) the @entity14 law will be the focus of saturday 's @entity230 immigration demonstrations , which have been held yearly since 2006			1
eleven protests are scheduled in @entity61 , with two in @entity232			2
@entity233 has eight protests slated , including five in @entity233			2
in @entity8 , demonstrations are planned in @entity236 and @entity237			1
the protests are being organized by the @entity239 and are being billed as " may day 2010 -- @entity240			2
" demonstrators want immigration reform that will lead to an easier path toward legal residency and citizenship			2
" we have an immigration system that has been neglected for 30 years , " said @entity246 of the @entity247			0
the @entity14 law is not the answer , she said			2
" that leads to greater chaos over that broken system , " @entity246 told @entity0			0
president @entity254 has called on @entity255 to pass a comprehensive immigration reform law this year			2
senate majority leader @entity257 and other top @entity259 senators unveiled the outlines of that legislation late thursday			0
but @entity263 minority leader @entity262 said at a briefing thursday that " there 's not a chance " that @entity255 will approve the measure this year , especially after the recent passage of health care reform			2
@entity254 conceded this week that immigration reform is not likely this year			0
the @entity14 law has raised concerns in @entity22 and throughout @entity47 , @entity80 officials say			2
" it comes up ... in every meeting we have with the region , " @entity274 spokesman @entity273 said thursday			0
" we are hearing the concerns of the hemisphere loud and clear			0
" secretary of state @entity281 said the @entity80 will work to " understand and mitigate " @entity22 's concerns			2
the @entity14 law , she said , will be on the agenda when @entity22 president @entity284 visits @entity6 on may 19			1
one of the two lawsuits against @entity30 was filed thursday by a police officer in @entity287 , @entity14 , who asked that local law enforcement be exempt from enforcing the measure			2
officer @entity290 says in the federal suit that the law will " seriously impede law enforcement investigations and facilitate the successful commission of crimes			0
" the @entity296 of @entity297 and @entity298 also filed a federal lawsuit thursday			0
the @entity300 , the @entity301 , the @entity301 of @entity14 and the @entity302 said thursday they also plan to jointly file a lawsuit			1
supporters of @entity30 cite high levels of illegal immigration and crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants as a reason for the new law			0
" border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state , " @entity28 said at the bill signing			0
" there is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of @entity14			0
we can not sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels			0
we can not stand idly by as drop houses , kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life			0
" but statistics from the @entity332 agency and the @entity333 indicate that both the number of illegal immigrants and violent crime have decreased in the state in recent years			0
according to @entity333 statistics , violent crimes in @entity14 dropped by nearly 1,500 reported incidents between 2005 and 2008			0
reported property crimes also fell during the same period , from about 287,000 reported incidents to 279,000			0
these decreases are accentuated by the fact that @entity14 's population grew by 600,000 people between 2005 and 2008			0
according to the nonpartisan @entity348 , proponents of the bill " overlook two salient points : crime rates have already been falling in @entity14 for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants , and a century 's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native - born			0
" federal officials estimate there are about 10.8 million illegal immigrants in the @entity80 , of which about 6.6 million come from @entity22 and 760,000 from the rest of @entity47			0
about 1 million come from @entity365			0
@entity14 , which is on the @entity22 border , has about 460,000 undocumented immigrants , the federal government says			0
at least five other states , including @entity61 with 2.6 million , have more undocumented immigrants , the government says			0
the other states with more illegal immigrants than @entity14 are @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity233 and @entity376			0
a @entity378 survey late last year found that @entity80 believe @entity379 are discriminated against more than any other major racial or ethnic group in @entity47 society			0
the @entity378 survey also indicated that about one - third of the nation 's @entity379 say they or someone they know has experienced discrimination			0
about 9 percent said they had been stopped by police or other authorities and asked about their immigration status in the year before the survey			0
fifty - seven percent of those surveyed said they worried that they , a family member or a close friend could be deported .			0
