@entity0 -- activists say the @entity3 is handing the enemy a victory the longer it allows the detention of enemy combatants at the @entity8 at @entity9 , @entity10			1
" when we leave them at @entity9 , in a military prison , we give them a status they do n't deserve , " said @entity11 , a former @entity12 judge advocate general			1
" we make them heroes and martyrs to their friends and colleagues back in terrorist camps , " he said			1
ten years after the first detainees were brought to @entity9 from what was considered the battlefield in @entity28 after 9/11 , constitutional and judicial experts held a news conference wednesday to say the @entity32 administration needs to restore @entity3 values of human rights and the rule of law			1
hundreds of protesters rallied later outside the @entity37 as part of the event , with organizers saying the rally was to " call on president @entity32 to keep his promise and shutter @entity9 now			1
" under the @entity44 administration , the @entity3 claimed that @entity9 detainees are not on @entity3 soil and therefore not covered by the @entity47 , and that " enemy combatant " status means they can be denied some legal protections			1
president @entity32 in january 2009 ordered the camp to be closed within a year , citing security concerns			2
but as of july of last year , 171 detainees remained at @entity9			1
their prolonged and murky circumstances were the focus of the wednesday event			0
" there is no case that is so important that we should sacrifice our dedication to human rights and rule of law , " @entity11 said			0
" it 's not a rule of law unless it applies all the time , and it 's not a human right unless it applies to all people			0
" @entity70 , a former chief prosecutor for the military commissions at @entity9 , said political interference from back home during the @entity44 administration blocked any basis for a fair trial			2
" initially i was probably the leading proponent for @entity9 , and for military commissions , " @entity70 , a retired @entity76 colonel , said wednesday			2
but he eventually resigned after he said the @entity44 administration pressured him to use evidence he felt was obtained through torture			0
" i believed at the time that we were committed to having full , fair and open trials , " @entity70 said			0
" i resigned when i lost confidence that that was our commitment			0
" @entity32 , in a 2009 speech delivered in @entity86 , @entity87 , acknowledged that the @entity3 had acted " contrary to our ideals " in the time that followed the 9/11 attacks			2
after telling his @entity93 audience he had " unequivocally prohibited the use of torture , " @entity32 then said he had " ordered the prison at @entity9 closed , " on a timetable that would have ended about a year ago			1
" if we roll up the @entity47 every time that there 's a difficult factual situation , we might as well roll up the entire democracy , " said @entity98 , executive director of the @entity99			0
@entity104 , a @entity105 whose son died in the attacks on @entity108 on september 11 , 2001 , spoke at the rally in front of the @entity37			2
" we say we are not at war with @entity112 , yet actions do speak louder than words , " @entity104 said			0
" @entity9 is a shame -- a disgrace for our nation and we need to set the record straight by leading by example			0
" despite a steady downpour of rain , the large group of protesters -- including some in orange jumpsuits symbolizing the @entity9 detainee uniforms , marched past the @entity37 and on to the @entity126 following the rally			1
