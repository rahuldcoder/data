" @entity6 " resurrects the time - traveling , r - rated antics of the cabin crew , with @entity2 stepping in for @entity3 in the @entity4 - directed follow - up to the 2010 hit comedy			1
more : @entity8 is next ' @entity9 ' host in ' @entity6 ' starring @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity18 's @entity17 - weekend release is tipped to earn $ 15 million or more			1
it was pushed back from its original @entity21 release date , when it was set to square off against " @entity22 " with @entity23 and @entity24			2
see what top critics are saying about " @entity6 " : the @entity28 's @entity27 calls it " a flop - sweaty cash grab that gives a bad name to sequels in which key talent has jumped ship			1
... suffering from much more than awkwardness over the absence of the original 's top - billed @entity3 , though it is certainly awkward about that , the film makes us wonder why we enjoyed spending time with his three returning costars in the first place			1
... @entity2 fills the cast 's likeability void nicely			1
but the character bears the brunt of the meanest gags in an intensely mean - spirited , arguably misogynistic film , one so dumb about its attempts to wring humor from taboos that it at one point has the victim of forcible sodomy pay a dreamy compliment to the size of his assailant 's genitals			2
" more : ' @entity61 @entity63 's @entity62 gives it two stars out of four , writing , " some of the gags are stupid - funny , others are just puerile , making for a hit - or - miss experience			1
the screenplay presents the thinnest of plots			0
... do n't expect consistency or much logic			0
" altogether , " like the first foray , the sequel is a good - natured raunch-fest that induces eye - rolling about as much as it does laughter			2
... for those who liked the first movie and find a plethora of penis jokes hilarious , this is a fitting sequel			0
but others should stay away			0
" the @entity84 's @entity83 says it 's worth one star out of five : " i hated @entity6 so much i now ca n't even think about the first one without feeling annoyed			0
this may suggest that the only solution is to go and make a third one to rescue the franchise , but really it may be time to leave well enough alone			0
" due to a flimsy plot " where nothing is at stake , ... even the brilliant @entity11 , whose every utterance gets at least a chuckle , ca n't save the movie			1
... truly , there 's nothing besides repeated use of swear words in lieu of wit			0
" more : ' @entity61 ' trailer goes back to the future ( and beyond ) @entity106 's @entity105 notes , " within five minutes you 'll guess why @entity3 , not overly encumbered with big film roles these days , did n't return for the sequel : the script is monotonous , meandering and witless , frantically ramming together middle - school non-ideas such as a guy being forced to rape another guy on a reality show , or a guy 's testicles projectile - exploding into the faces of two other guys , or a guy being shot in both the head and the man - parts			2
... the smart plotting of the first film is completely gone			0
