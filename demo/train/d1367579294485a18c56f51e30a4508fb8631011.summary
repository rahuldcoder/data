-- next - generation video game consoles are nearly upon us , and with them will come increased power and cutting - edge developer tech. analysts expect early games on the @entity8 and @entity9 will look more realistic thanks to enhanced graphics capabilities			1
but some current - generation games are already bridging between real - life actors and near - real - life game simulations			1
the result is a film - like quality to the action in the games , creating a deeper feeling of immersion in the narrative			1
@entity25 developer @entity23 started down this path in 2010 with " @entity27 , " a noir - thriller game featuring characters that nearly resembled human actors			1
the facial expressions were highly detailed and small , human movements -- like shifting from foot to foot while standing still -- portrayed the virtual figures as more than mere avatars on a screen			1
@entity23 used a process called motion capture			1
mo - cap , as it is less formally called , is a video process of tracking movements by placing markers on real actors to record their motions			1
it has been used in video game making since 1995 , but the quality has improved dramatically in the past few years			0
in many video game mo - cap productions , body movements and facial features are recorded separately , then merged together during final production			1
but @entity23 founder @entity55 wanted something more for his new title , " beyond : two souls			2
" @entity55 used a technique called " performance capture , " which is similar to mo - cap except all an actor 's movements , along with dialogue and other sounds , are recorded at the same time			1
the entire performance is captured in one take and allows actors to interact with each other during a scene instead of being brought together by a computer later			1
" with ' @entity73 , ' we have added complexity			0
we wanted to capture the movement of the eyes of the actors , which is always a major challenge , " @entity55 said			1
" we found a way ... to give them real life and really capture the subtlety of the performance			1
" the result is a smoother , more realistic portrayal of the interaction between characters			0
while , in a way , it 's like shooting a movie , the interactive nature of video games means developers have to plan for many different player actions			2
so , the same scene will be shot in several different ways to anticipate what could happen			0
@entity55 said making a game look more realistic creates stronger emotional ties for the player			0
" if we can create this link , the player will start to care for the character and identify himself through the character and then start to feel what the character on the screen feels , " he said			0
this new realism push is n't limited to characters			2
driving games have also been creating more realistic cars and applying more accurate physics to movements			1
sports games are nearly television - broadcast quality in their depiction of the play on the field			1
however , there 's one gaming genre that is n't trying to go full on real life -- for perhaps obvious reasons			0
military shooter game developers say they 're striving to bring the feel of war to the player without going too far			2
" @entity127 : ghosts " and " @entity129 " are two recent examples			0
@entity132 ceo @entity131 said people want to be able to do things in video games they ca n't do in real life , but for first - person shooter games , there should be a limit			1
" the genre does give an incredibly visceral opportunity for us to put people in fairly extraordinary situations with a very high realism , but with also a very good deal of poetic license , " @entity131 said			2
" we want to get the details right to suspend your disbelief , but our developers take you on a fictitious thrill ride			0
" @entity153 executive director @entity152 said as a developer of " @entity127 : ghosts , " his group talks to former and current military personnel to learn what the troops experience , to help get the equipment right			2
" it is amazing how that ( military ) community has been , " @entity152 said			2
" they tell us stuff that they 've been a part of that there 's just no way we would put in the game because no one would believe it			0
" gun violence in @entity176 movies has tripled executive producer @entity177 , of " @entity129 " developer @entity178 , said the game 's depiction of war is n't intended to be realistic , but aims to be accurate and authentic			0
he said advancements in game engines have helped create a heightened sense of realism			2
" we can do more with dynamic environments , " @entity177 said			0
" now , everything is alive			0
we have ' @entity190 , ' a play on words for evolution of levels			0
you have weather changes , calm seas turning into stormy ocean in real - time and at the same time you are playing			2
" the move toward more realistic or film - like games has also created a cross-over effect between the video game industry and @entity205			1
@entity177 said @entity178 , like other developers , have people on their development team who have also worked on movies			0
" we use talent , not only from the visual effects areas , but from other places like set design to help us create realistic environments , " he said			0
gamers ' expectations of dynamic environments and realistic characters are only expected to grow with the new @entity8 and @entity9 consoles			1
during the @entity8 event in february , @entity23 used the new console for a tech demo so detailed that it initially confused some people as to whether it was live or computer - generated			1
" @entity230 " was , at the time , a glimpse into how powerful the consoles were and what could be done with them			0
@entity55 , of @entity23 , said of the demo : " it really sets the bar for next - gen acting and what acting can be in a game			0
" not just for laughs : @entity237 cartoons give @entity240 businesses winning edge			0

" beyond : two souls " and other new games feature a new level of realism
" performance capture " tech records actors ' movements , faces and voice all at once
military shooters intentionally *shy* away from hyper - realism
new @entity8 , @entity9 predicted to further the trend
