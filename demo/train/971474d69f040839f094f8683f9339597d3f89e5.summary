@entity0 , @entity1 -- the alleged @entity4 mobster and his girlfriend were known as @entity6 and @entity7 , a may - december couple living in the heart of sunny @entity1 , just two blocks from the beach and an upscale outdoor mall , in a town known for its unapologetic liberalism			1
but their real names were @entity17 , 81 , and @entity18 , 60			1
and recently , @entity20 had been telling friends that @entity17 was showing signs of @entity23 's and was suffering depression , unable to sleep or to get out of bed , neighbor @entity19 told @entity2			1

they were largely quiet , polite neighbors who occasionally helped @entity19 carry her groceries or newspaper , said @entity19 , who lives in the same building as @entity17 and @entity20			1

" was he even hiding ? " asked @entity189 , 45 , a copier salesman who works down the street from the @entity17 apartment			2
