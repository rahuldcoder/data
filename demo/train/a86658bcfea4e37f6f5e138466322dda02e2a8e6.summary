@entity0 -- after several weeks of indecision , the @entity3 administration has decided against closing 149 contractor - run air traffic control towers due to sweeping budget cuts			1
the decision by the @entity8 brought a " sigh of relief " from small - and medium - sized airports nationwide that would have been impacted by the closures			1
those towers employ some 900 controllers and the airports employ a range of other workers			2
the decision follows action by @entity18 two weeks ago granting transportation planners budget flexibility for working around the consequences of mandatory budget cuts throughout the government			1
the @entity24 , which oversees air traffic services , was required to slash $ 253 million from its accounts this fiscal year			2
friday 's announcement completes a near total reversal of plans by the @entity8 to impose draconian austerity measures on @entity24 programs in response to the sweeping cuts known as sequester			1
they took effect on march 1 following inaction by @entity18 on deficit reduction			0
transportation secretary @entity38 said prior to sequester that the @entity24 would have to furlough all 47,000 @entity24 employees on a rotating basis			0
the agency would also be forced to close low - activity control towers , and cut the overnight shifts at many more to meet the budget targets through september 30			1
but when controller furloughs in april were blamed for causing widespread flight delays , aviation industry and other pressure mounted on @entity18 to grant the @entity8 new budget powers to ease the impact of sequestration			1
the controller furloughs ended after that was done and the @entity24 this week said it would not shut down certain control towers during overnight hours			1
on friday , the @entity8 restored funding to contract - run towers as well as other programs			1
towers that were on the chopping block operate with contractors , acting under @entity24 supervision			1
the @entity8 and @entity24 insisted in february that the cuts would not endanger the flying public , but opponents disagreed			2
" in the end common sense prevailed over politics , " sen. @entity65 , @entity66 , said in a statement			0
opponents demonstrated " that there are more responsible ways to cut spending than by compromising safety			0
" the decision also was applauded by aviation interests			0
" we 're very pleased , " said @entity77 , executive director of the @entity79 @entity78			0
controllers were happy to learn their jobs have been spared , airports were " ecstatic " the towers would remain open and communities breathed " a sigh of relief , " he said			0
@entity77 said he believes the administration was swayed by two letters , one signed by 41 senators and one by 83 @entity92 members , urging the @entity8 and @entity24 to keep the towers open			2
" as you know , sequestration is n't a one - year deal			0
so we will continue to be at this			0
but at least right now , the towers being able to stay open until the end of september is terrific , " @entity77 said .			0

@entity24 reverses course after @entity18 grants flexibility for dealing with budget cuts
some 149 towers and small and medium - sized airports were threatened with closure
those towers are run by contractors overseen by the @entity24
@entity24 has already ended controller furloughs and other *key* austerity measures
