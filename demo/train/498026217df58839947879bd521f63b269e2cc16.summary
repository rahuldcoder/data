-- recently , a reader dropped the following query into our inbox : " this may be a stupid question , but recently a friend told me he 's heard of people using @entity9 as a dating service			1
my @entity9 friends and i ( admittedly middle - aged ) ca n't figure out how you " meet " people on @entity9			1
i ( and most of my friends ) are @entity9 friends with people we actually know			1
how would one use @entity9 as a dating site ? " - flummoxed by @entity19 oh , flummoxed ! there are no stupid questions -- only painfully , painfully stupid people			1
. social media flirting is a phenom that has been around since the message board / chatroom days , when starry - eyed 13 - year - olds and rheumy - eyed 61 - year - olds traded " a / s / l ? " s with optimistic abandon			1
a quick survey of my social followers -- on @entity30 , @entity9 , @entity31 and @entity32 -- revealed that , among my socially savvy circle of folks , people have dated / married suitors they met on @entity37 , @entity9 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , to name a few			1
in fact , this past week , the story of how one couple met on @entity45 swept the blogosphere : @entity48 and @entity49 started playing the smartphone - based word game and were pitted against each other randomly			0
after talking via the game 's " chat " feature and later communicating on @entity56 and e-mail , the pair met in person , and , eventually married -- @entity49 moving from his native @entity60 to @entity61 to be with his bride			0
while all of this may seem weird / creepy / slightly sad to anyone who did n't grow up a digital native , consider this : @entity67 now spend about a quarter of their online time using social networks			1
if you 're giving your monitor the old glassy eyeball instead of tipping back highballs at your local tv - plastered sports bar , that 's likely where you 're going to make connections			0
however , the actual process of meeting people via social media is still rather , well , creepy			1
( less creepy than back in the days of message boards and @entity82 chatrooms , but creepy all the same			0
) assuming that you are not , in fact , a weirdo who collects spleens ( we give you guys so much leeway on this factor ) , here are some tips on how to make any social media site a dating site without being a creep			2
do n't : compliment incessantly : you know that dude who staggers up to you at the bar , breathes whiskey into your face and murmurs , " hey lady , you got mad cleavage , yo			1
" he 's creepy , right ? he 's even kind of creepy when he goes a less aggressive route and compliments something benign , like your eyes ( " you have lovely orbs ... may i have them ? " )			0
why ? because he 's stating his intentions off the bat , and our society -- addled by years and years of romantic comedy - viewage -- prefers a bit of a chase			0
when engaging with people via social media , talking about their appearance / demeanor / eyeballs is even more unsettling than at the bar , because you do n't know the person in question and you ca n't see their face in the flesh			1
instead of going directly for flattery , start up a conversation with the object of your desire , thereby charming them with your wit and whimsy rather than empty poesy ( or straight - up sexual harassment )			0
come to think of it , that 's probably good advice for comporting yourself at ye olde sports bar as well			0
repeat yourself : if your hoped - for intended does n't reply to the first five tweets you send him about your shared love of fossils and tesseracts , cease and desist with your wooing			1
he does n't like you			2
erase your face : no one wants to date a picture of a donut			2
when choosing your avatar , make sure to show your face , or , at the very least , link to a website featuring a picture of your mug			0
if you 're sensitive about your big - ass nose or your shiny head , just chill out			0
ugly people get married , too -- i see their progeny on the subway daily			0
exhibit your courtship : some initial public bantering is fine -- via @entity30 , @entity163 , etc -- but if you carry on your heavy flirting ( " omg ! i love the shape of your broken nose ! you look like a matador ! " ) in a public forum , you risk annoying your friends and followers or , worse , embarrassing your potential date -- especially if you ask out said potential date publicly			2
have we learned nothing from that dude who asked that girl to marry him on the @entity177 ? @entity30 allows you to @entity178 people , @entity9 boasts private messages and even @entity38 has an internal messaging service called @entity182 now -- there 's no excuse for blithely pda'ing the hell out of your swain			1
play phantom : we 're assuming that you actually want to meet the object of your late - night @entity189 stalking , so when it comes to digital flirting -- bring it offline asap			2
we 're also assuming that said person wants to meet you ( we 're trusting you again here , guys -- hopefully you possess the social skills to recognize interest , unlike that aforementioned dude in the sports bar )			2
so why not ask them to hang in person ? or , better yet , in the presence of tons and tons of friends who can waylay a possible kidnapping / murder scenario .			0

people meet and date on @entity37 , @entity9 , @entity38 , @entity39 and other sites
@entity67 now spend about a quarter of their online time using social networks
do n't compliment incessantly , repeat yourself or keep flirting online too long
