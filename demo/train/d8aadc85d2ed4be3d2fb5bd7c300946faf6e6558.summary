at @entity5 , in eastern @entity6 in the summer of 2006 , a young intelligence analyst named @entity4 tried with great difficulty to understand exactly what he was hearing			1
the 10th @entity9 of the @entity10 wanted to do what ? @entity4 had to choose his words carefully			1
he was just a low - ranking " specialist " with the @entity13 , a very low man on a very tall totem pole			1
a round - faced 26 - year - old , @entity4 had simple tastes — @entity18 football , comic books — and a reputation for mulishness belied by his innocent appearance			1
@entity4 stared at his superior officer , 2nd lt. @entity23 , who was running this briefing for him and sgt. @entity25			1
@entity23 headed intelligence for @entity27 , the @entity10 's aviation component at @entity5 , in @entity29 , adjacent to the @entity31 border			1
military leaders considered this area , officially designated @entity34 , the most dangerous part of an increasingly dangerous country			2
soldiers from the @entity39 — a light infantry division designed for quick deployment and fighting in harsh conditions — had recently come to this hot corner of @entity6 and would soon be spreading throughout the region , setting up outposts and bases			1
more specifically , they would be establishing a camp in @entity49			2
the members of the intelligence team led by @entity23 did n't know much about @entity49 , as @entity53 forces had generally been focusing their efforts on @entity55 , which had become a haven for @entity58 insurgents and foreign fighters sneaking in from @entity31 to oppose the @entity53 " infidels			1
" during one operation in @entity55 the previous summer , in 2005 , 19 @entity53 troops — @entity63 — had been killed by such insurgents , and since then , the @entity53 had increased its presence there			1
helicopters flying in and out of @entity55 were fired upon at least twice a week , every week , with small arms and / or rocket - propelled grenades			2
tapper on ' the bravest of the brave ' @entity49 was farther north , a province so mythically untamed that one of the greatest writers of the @entity75 language , @entity76 , had chosen it as the setting for his 1888 novella " @entity79			2
" one of @entity76 's @entity81 adventurers , @entity82 , describes @entity49 as a place where " no one has gone ... and they fight , and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men can always be a king			1
" " you 'll be cut to pieces before you 're 50 miles across the border , " warns @entity76 's narrator			1
" the people are utter brutes , and even if you reached them you could n't do anything			2
" the region 's previous brigade commander , col. @entity99 , had n't thought @entity49 had much strategic value , so conventional forces had n't been posted there , and no one had troubled to find out much about the native people , the @entity106 , a distinct and outlying ethnic group within @entity6			1
in a departure from his predecessor 's policy , @entity99 's replacement — col. @entity112 , the commander of the 10th @entity9 's @entity113 , known as the @entity114 — ordered the establishment of small outposts throughout the area in the summer of 2006 , in an attempt not only to stop the @entity58 fighters who were streaming in from @entity31 , often with bushels of weapons , but also to win over the locals , who were predisposed to a suspicion of outsiders			1
@entity23 had just returned from @entity125 , in @entity55 , where he 'd met with officers of the @entity39 's @entity127 , @entity128 , or " 3 ‑ 71 @entity129			1
" they 'd told him of their plan to set up an outpost in the @entity134 of @entity49 , for which he would be in charge of identifying suitable helicopter landing zones			2
the new base would sit adjacent to the @entity49 hamlet of @entity139			2
a small settlement missing from most maps , @entity140 was home to fewer than 40 families of @entity106 , or roughly 200 people , who lived in houses made of wood and rock and mud sealant			2
the residents were primarily subsistence farmers trying to eke out a living through both crops and livestock , but the @entity10 knew little more than that about them			2
coalition forces likewise had next to no intelligence about the enemy in @entity49 — its numbers , its location , its intentions , or , most important , its capabilities — which was one of the reasons the brass was pushing to build a base there			2
this was the essential difficulty of the task at hand : the higher - ups in the @entity10 needed to know about the enemy in this unexplored province , so in order to learn as much as they could , they were going to stick a small group of troops in its midst			0
for all @entity23 knew when he flew over @entity182 to reconnoiter , the hamlet might have been @entity184 's secret compound			1
hero soldier to get medal of honor " they 're going to build another outpost , " @entity23 told @entity4 and @entity25 back at @entity5			0
" so i need you to take this terrain analysis i started , finish it , and make it pretty so i can brief it in the morning			0
" many troops were far more proficient in @entity194 than they were with firearms , so @entity4 understood just what @entity23 meant by " make it pretty " : the slides for the presentation needed to look crisp and to make a compelling case			0
" where are they going ? " @entity4 asked			0
@entity23 gestured at the topographical map			0
" right over here , northwest of @entity125 , " he said			0
" where the @entity206 and @entity207 meet			0
" @entity4 looked at the spot , stunned			0
" right there ? " he asked			0
" right there , " confirmed @entity23			0
" can you do it ? " " i can do it ; i have all night , " @entity4 said			0
" but sir ... that is a really awful place for a base			0
" this new camp in the @entity134 would , like the dangerous @entity219 outpost that their pilots knew too well , be surrounded by higher ground			0
but whereas the base in the @entity219 was situated about halfway up a mountainside , in a former lumberyard , the one in @entity134 would sit in a cup within the valley 's deepest cleft , ringed by three steep mountains that formed part of the 500 - mile - long @entity233 mountain range			1
blocked off on its northern , western , and southern sides by rivers and mountains , it would moreover be a mere 14 miles distant from the official @entity31 border — a porous boundary that meant little to the insurgents who regularly crossed it to kill @entity53 and @entity6 government officials before taking refuge in caves or in the mountains or returning to their haven across the border			1
the camp would be one of the most remote outposts in this most remote part of a country that was itself cut off from much of the rest of the world , and the area all around it would be filled with people who wanted to kill those stationed there			0
defending the indefensible " so it 's located at the base of a mountain peak ? " @entity4 asked			1
it did n't take a @entity265 or a @entity266 to know that as a matter of basic military strategy , it was better to be at the top of a hill than at the bottom of a valley			0
" " and it 's flanked by a river on the west and another river to the north ? " @entity4 continued			1
" and there 's no good road to get to it — they 're still building that , " @entity23 volunteered			1
the @entity10 had been coordinating efforts to build up the vulnerable and narrow path from @entity284 to @entity134 , but rain , steep cliffs , insurgent threats , and high turnover rates among local construction workers had led to frequent delays			0
the road , often running along the edge of a cliff that spilled into the @entity294 , was a mere 13 feet wide at its widest , and in some spots only half that — narrower than many military vehicles			0
a soldier could be killed just driving on that road , without ever coming into contact with a single enemy fighter			0
" and it 's an eternity away by helicopter if something goes wrong , " @entity4 said			1
" yup , " agreed @entity23			0
" sir , this is a really bad idea , " said @entity4			0
anyone we drop off there is going to die			0

@entity0 's @entity313 tells the story of @entity315 in his book
@entity6 's @entity318 was brutally attacked in 2009
the attack pitted 53 @entity53 soldiers against *400* @entity58 fighters
