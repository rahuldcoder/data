, essentially justifying its own practices			0
the entire document is dated august 9 , 2013 , and has no attributable names or contact details on it			2
its most striking portion ? a separate block of text on page six , which states : " according to figures published by a major tech provider , the @entity19 carries 1,826 petabytes of information per day			0
in its foreign intelligence mission , @entity6 touches about 1.6 % of that			1
however , of the 1.6 % of the data , only 0.025 % is actually selected for review			1
the net effect is that @entity6 analysts look at 0.00004 % of the world 's traffic in conducting their mission — that 's less than one part in a million			1
put another way , if a standard basketball court represented the global collection would be represented by an area smaller than a dime on that basketball court			0
" and , nearly directly below that section , the @entity6 presents its strongest categorical denial of using foreign partners to circumvent @entity44 law : " @entity6 partners with well over 30 different nations in order to conduct its foreign intelligence mission			1
in every case , @entity6 does not and will not use a relationship with a foreign intelligence service to ask that service to do what @entity6 is itself prohibited by law from doing			1
these partnerships are an important part of the @entity44 and allied defense against terrorists , cyber threat actors , and others who threaten our individual and collective security			0
both parties to these relationships benefit			0
" the document begins by referencing the september 11 , 2001 attacks on @entity66 and @entity67 , and notes that the @entity6 " did not have the tools or the database to search to identify [ terorrist ] connections and share them with the @entity71			1
" the @entity6 then argues : " we do not need to sacrifice civil liberties for the sake of national security ; both are integral to who we are as @entity44			1
@entity6 can and will continue to conduct its operations in a manner that respects both			2
" and how , pray tell , might an @entity44 's e-mail be accidentally swept up in a dragnet that is ostensibly targeting a foreign suspect ? " for example , a @entity44 person might be courtesy copied on an e-mail to or from a legitimate foreign target , or a person in the @entity44 might be in contact with a known terrorist target			0
in those cases , minimization procedures adopted by the attorney general in consultation with the director of national intelligence and approved by the @entity95 are used to protect the privacy of the @entity44 person			0
these minimization procedures control the acquisition , retention , and dissemination of any @entity44 person information incidentally acquired during operations conducted pursuant to @entity104			0
" of course , also on friday , @entity105 published an excerpt from a document leaked by @entity108 showing that the @entity6 has the ability to search @entity44 ' e-mails — but apparently restrains itself from doing so			1
the document also notes @entity112 of the @entity113 — the business records provision — is what gives the the government the authority to capture telephony metadata			0
at the end of the document , the @entity6 also argues that it has adequate oversight from a number of government agencies — @entity124 probably would disagree with that — and also is able to police itself			1
as the @entity6 concludes : " in addition to @entity6 's compliance safeguards , @entity6 personnel are obligated to report when they believe @entity6 is not , or may not be , acting consistently with law , policy , or procedure			2
this self - reporting is part of the culture and fabric of @entity6			2
if @entity6 is not acting in accordance with law , policy , or procedure , @entity6 will report through its internal and external intelligence oversight channels , conduct reviews to understand the root cause , and make appropriate adjustments to constantly improve			2

@entity6 says it looks at tiny *fraction* of web traffic
security agency released rare document on policies friday
says it " touches " 1.6 % of web traffic , reads .00004 %
