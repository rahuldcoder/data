-- shall i compare thee , @entity2 , to a sunny day ? thou art more lovely and flavorful than a @entity4 or a @entity5			1
no , actually this article will not be a @entity8 - inspired sonnet to a twinkie			2
in fact , to paraphrase a more appropriate @entity8 passage : " i come to bury @entity2 , not to praise it			2
" on friday , @entity2 producer @entity13 announced it would be closing down , thus ending its product line			1
the response to this snack apocalypse was swift			0
@entity18 and @entity19 were filled with comments bemoaning the loss of this creme - filled sponge cake			0
eulogies appeared in publications across the country			0
people began to hoard @entity2 , leaving store shelves once lined with @entity2 bare			2
and with the supply in stores dwindling , some took to @entity31 to purchase them			0
( as if there were n't hundreds of other high - calorie , chemically colored , obese - inducing snack cakes you could consume			1
) there appears to be no end to the mass mourning for this snack cake so closely associated with our childhoods			0
it was as if the loss of @entity2 was somehow going to erase our fondest childhood memories			2
but here 's my question : where were you when @entity13 needed you ? such as any day before they announced its closing			2
before friday , you could have easily bought twinkies , @entity4 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 's or any other @entity13 treat			1
but you were n't there for them then			0
the company 's sales dropped , and with rising costs , @entity13 had to file for bankruptcy			2
not once , but twice : in 2004 and again in 2012			0
@entity13 has lost $ 250 million over the last three years and is saddled with more than $ 850 million in debt			2
nope , you were n't there for them then			0
and neither was @entity69 ? because millions of us began to realize that junk food was not good for us			1
so in a desperate effort to live forever -- or at least a little longer -- many of us began to cut @entity2 , and foods like it , out of our diets			1
true , @entity2 offered a tasty treat , but it also offered other things , such as 300 calories per package of two , nine grams of fat and 37 other ingredients ranging from high fructose corn syrup to chemicals that i never heard of			2
and then there 's the even more insidious @entity4 -- they 're even higher in fat and calories than twinkies at 368 calories a serving and a whopping 19.4 grams of fat , which represents 30 % of the total fat nutritionists recommend we consume in a day			1
the upside to these chemicals is that @entity2 never seem to grow old -- they 're the @entity97 of snack foods			1
they can likely be bequeathed to your grandkids and look the same as the day you bought them			0
but before anyone becomes truly depressed over @entity2 ' fate , keep in mind that @entity2 will never really disappear -- and not just because of preservatives			0
on monday , @entity13 announced it will enter into mediation with the striking @entity109 , which offers a little hope that the company might be saved			0
and there is always a chance that another company will buy the rights to produce twinkies if @entity13 does indeed close			1
but even if you are never be able to consume a twinkie again , @entity2 will live forever in pop culture			1
twinkies have appeared in movies for years from " @entity122 " to animated films such as " @entity124 " to " @entity125 , " where @entity127 's character searched , prophetically , for the last box of @entity2			1
@entity129 : is this my last twinkie ever ? while you may not be able to consume them , @entity2 will live forever in pop culture			1
twinkies have appeared in movies for years from " @entity122 " to animated films such as " @entity124 " to " @entity125 , " where @entity127 's character searched , prophetically , for the last box of @entity2			1
twinkies will even live in the annals of criminal justice , thanks to the famed " twinkie defense			1
" @entity141 shot and killed @entity143 mayor @entity142 and @entity144 and gay activist @entity145 in 1978			0
at @entity141 's trial , his attorneys argued that his diet of sugary snack foods , such as @entity2 , had damaged his mental capacity			1
@entity141 was found not guilty of murder , but of the lesser charge of manslaughter			0
but there is one real loss in the closing of @entity13 that should evoke sympathy			0
it 's not the possible end of @entity13 ' @entity161 or even its oh - so - soft and white @entity162			1
it 's the 18,500 @entity13 employees who are out of work			0
it 's obviously never good to have your job end with no warning -- it 's even worse when that happens in a challenging economy such as ours and right before the holiday season			0
but as we close the book on @entity2 , we can all take some solace in the fact that they had a great 82 - year run			1
it makes me think of the words of @entity181 : " parting is such sweet sorrow			0
" although on a calorie - by - calorie basis , i think @entity2 might actually be sweeter			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity187 : @entity13 might shut down and prove twinkies are n't really *indestructible*
the chemical - *stuffed* snack inspires *nostalgia* , he says , but who eats them now ?
@entity187 : we *rejected* junk food and stopped buying @entity2 , @entity4
still , the twinkie will live on in pop culture and had a good 82 - year run , he writes
