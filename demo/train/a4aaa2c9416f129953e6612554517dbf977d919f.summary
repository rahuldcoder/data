@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and his two brothers crouch on a field , picking through blades of grass and staring at the soil			1
they have traveled five days by foot to a @entity12 meadow at a 4,300 meter elevation deep inside @entity1 's @entity0 district			1
they came , as tens of thousands do each year , to harvest a highly valuable commodity from the high - altitude soil : the @entity12 caterpillar fungus -- also known as @entity20			1
@entity22 fungus , or as it 's called in @entity23 , " yartsa gunbu , " meaning " summer grass , winter worm , " is a specimen created when a parasitic fungus infects caterpillars underground which , were they not forestalled by the fungus , would produce ghost moths			1
after the fungus mummifies the caterpillar underground , it thrusts out of the soil			1
it 's this tiny protuberance that the harvesters spend weeks each spring searching for			1
a hundred or so people crawl across the field in a mulled silence until a sole searcher lets out an excited cry			2
dozens rush over to witness , @entity43 is the first to arrive			0
the woman who has discovered the specimen uses an ice pick to prod the earth and dig a hole about six inches in diameter			0
she then lifts a clump of earth up and sifts out the specimen			0
the crowd gossips about its value -- " it 's small , only 300 rupees ! " ( about $ 3 )			1
a middle man will offer her that amount , then walk it to a market in @entity62 and sell it for three times the price			0
@entity3 explains : " we pay attention when other people find them			2
this is our first time coming for the harvest			2
we 've been here for nearly a week			0
we have n't found anything , because we do n't know what they look like -- we do n't know what we 're looking for			2
" see also : @entity12 glaciers ' buck melting trend ' like many others , @entity3 and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone			2
" people in our village talked about the money to be earned , so we came , " he says			2
the rumors of riches are not baseless			0
according to experts , the market value of yartsa gunbu has increased by 900 % between 1997 and 2008			0
one study says 500 grams of top quality yartsa gunbu can sell for up to $ 13,000 in @entity94 , @entity62 , or up to $ 26,000 in @entity95			0
average annual income in @entity1 's rural mid-and - far - western hills , where many harvesters live , is just $ 283 , according to the government			1
police in @entity0 expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year			1
the influx of migrant harvesters speaks volumes to the increasing global commodification of yartsa gunbu			2
prized in traditional @entity23 and @entity111 medicinal practices for its power as an elixir or an aphrodisiac , in recent years commercial dubbing of the product as " @entity20 " has driven up both demand and market value around the world			1
but the unprecedented flood of harvesters has observers concerned about the environmental impacts of this informal economic boom			0
" look at the hills , " says @entity124 , a student in @entity0 , " they 're all torn up from people digging			1
by next year they 'll be deserts			0
" @entity124 , who was visiting home for the harvest , remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty , not commercial competition			0
" just five years ago the numbers were lower , " he says			0
" every year we see more people come and more grasslands get damaged			1
people who come hack at the land with tools and leave it to dry out			0
" he says his family 's yaks have died in recent winters due to depleted grass caused by the harvest			1
see also : bringing @entity1 's ghost town back to life environmental protection measures offer some hope			1
six years ago , a committee of community leaders in @entity0 instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes			1
the committee charges locals 1,000 rupees ( $ 11 ) and outsiders 3,000 rupees ( $ 33 ) to join the harvest			1
the system is intended to spend the money on environmental protection measures and to subsidize food for villages in the district			0
similar systems exist in harvest areas across the @entity12			0
however , some worry the measure is ineffective			0
a former committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggests that charging admission to the harvest has only made it seem even more valuable , and as a result , drawn more harvesters			2
" the goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest , but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people , " he says			2
a leading expert on @entity12 caterpillar fungus , ecologist and geographer @entity193 , believes the future of the harvests is contingent on many factors -- collection intensity , rainfall , and climate change among them			1
" centuries of collection indicate that caterpillar fungus is a relatively resilient resource , " he says			1
but his research suggests that over-harvesting is contributing to fewer fungal spores being around for the next season			0
@entity193 believes education is the key element to promoting sustainable resource conservation			2
" knowledge of fungal reproduction ... and ( establishing ) an end - date to the collection season might allow for sufficient spore dispersal to guarantee sustainability , " he adds			0
as communities in @entity1 , one of the world 's poorest countries , cope with the economic need and the increasing desire for high - value commodities like yartsa gunbu , conservation efforts will require cooperation between leaders at village , district , and national levels			1
there is no question this @entity12 " gold rush " buoys rural economies			0
keeping it around for future generations will be the challenge .			0

@entity22 fungus -- known as @entity20 -- is prized in traditional medicine
thousands of people travel to @entity1 's @entity0 district each year to harvest the caterpillar fungus
some locals say the harvesters are damaging *hillsides* and grasslands
expert says education is needed for the harvesting to be sustainable long term
