it was a friday evening in february when @entity1 , an 18 - year - old from the town of @entity3 , @entity4 , accepted an invitation from two friends to accompany them on what was proposed as an overnight fishing expedition			1
their plan , according to @entity1 's mother , @entity11 , " was to return the following morning			1
on february 24 , they left from @entity13 in the town of @entity15 aboard a small fishing boat			1
" but the following morning came and went without their return , and the @entity1 family started looking for the 18 - year - old and his friends			1
@entity22 , the teen 's father and a hotel worker , asked fishermen to search for them along the shore from which they had departed , and his mother prayed at home with relatives and friends			1
soon after , the @entity4 navy joined the search , sending ships and airplanes to look for @entity1 , @entity35 , 24 , and @entity36 , 16			1
for nearly a month , their fate remained a mystery			0
but on march 21 , fishermen spotted the boat , the @entity41 , adrift north of the @entity42 , nearly 600 miles from where it had launched			1
after being alerted by the fishermen , the @entity45 navy rescued the lone crew member			0

" @entity1 returned tuesday to @entity59 on a commercial flight			2
according to his mother , he had lost 20 pounds			2
" after 28 days of anguish , after praying to @entity63 that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle , " @entity61 said			2
she said her son told her the fishing trip had started out well			1
the three caught plenty of fish			0
but the boat 's engine died without warning and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , there was little the trio could do , @entity61 told @entity78			1
soon , currents had swept their boat out into the @entity81 , far from the coast			1
@entity83 said they ate raw fish and drank rainwater			1
she did not detail how the other two died			0
the @entity45 navy has said it is not investigating the deaths and considers the incident a rescue operation			0
@entity83 described an emotional reunion tuesday at the airport in @entity59 , where relatives hugged @entity1 and cried tears of joy			2
he was taken to his home in @entity3 , in @entity4 's @entity98 province , southwest of the capital			1
reached wednesday by phone , @entity61 said her son " has been sleeping a lot			0
we do n't want to ask him any questions because we know he 's traumatized			0
he 's surrounded by the family			0
we 're loving on him and trying to help him feel better			0
we 're going to take him to a psychologist tomorrow			0
" @entity83 said her son is " a very loving and hardworking young man " who enjoys spending time with his brothers and loves soccer			0
