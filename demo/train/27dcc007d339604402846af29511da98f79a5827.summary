@entity0 , @entity1 -- like his long - time hero @entity4 , @entity1 music pioneer @entity3 was born visually - impaired			1
and again , like the @entity9 @entity8 legend , the lack of sight was never enough to stop @entity3 from realizing his ambitions			2
instead , it only fueled his optimism and desire to achieve success			0
" being blind has played an integral role in forming who i am and i think to some extent is responsible for my optimism , " says @entity3 , an award - winning music producer , song - writer and musician			1
" when you feel there 's nothing more to lose -- if you want to work towards anything , you probably will want to work towards gaining and i think that 's what being blind has done for me			1
" a versatile musical talent , @entity3 has been pushing the boundaries of @entity1 's contemporary sound			1
his fresh mixture of different styles and beats has helped the west @entity36 country become one the continent 's modern music hotspots			2
" i fuse a lot of stuff to create my music " he says			0
" it varies -- it 's jazz , it 's classical , it 's @entity45 , it 's whatever , it depends on what best interprets the music			2
" ' @entity50 's @entity49 ' spreads message of brotherhood possessed of natural talent , the self - taught musician started honing his skills from an early age while growing up in a barracks			1
as a young boy , he used to organize concerts in his neighborhood , drumming on his mother 's barrels of water			0
" all the kids from the neighboring block would come and we 'd hang out and we 'd make so much noise			0
i did n't realize at the time that i was preparing myself for what would be my life , my career path , my destiny , " @entity3 remembers			2
his musical journey , however , seemed to come to a halt a few years later when he entered university to pursue studies in law			0
but @entity3 soon realized that he had to follow his musical passion , leaving university to embark on a path that , for a young blind musician in @entity1 , was far from easy to tread			1
" ( i had to ) sleep on studio floors all across @entity0 , worked at different studios , worked without pay , i 've been out on the road , out on the streets , doing my thing , " @entity3 recalls			0
" i had to convince people that i could do it -- i had sessions that were canceled because they were n't sure i could deliver either because they thought i was too young or maybe as a blind person , ' how do we trust our music which is our future and investment ? ' " he adds			0
but it did n't take long for @entity3 to prove himself as his musical talent soon began to shine			1
over the next few years he went on to work closely with internationally - renowned artists such as pop sensation @entity100 and @entity8 star @entity101 and today he is a much - in demand producer operating from his own studio			1
@entity100 , @entity36 pop legend in the making he is also a judge on @entity1 's " @entity105 , " a television musical talent show where he helps young singers achieve their dreams			1
" it 's important for me to mentor and inspire fresh talent , to work with fresh talent , " he says			1
" i feel there is a lot i 've learned in my journey as far as music is concerned and i 'm in a position to share that knowledge			0
" but @entity3 is not only interested in helping out fledgling music stars			2
he also sees himself as an ambassador for blind young @entity1 who still face many challenges in their daily lives			2
" i think it would be meaningless if i can achieve as much as i can achieve and as much as i hope to achieve and i 'm not able to affect other blind people , " he says			0
" it is time to bring to the fore the needs of people with special needs and just how much they can contribute to growing @entity1 as a nation and the world			0
" @entity131 contributed to this report .			0
