-- how 's your year going ? probably not as well as the @entity2 's			1
the former wrestling star ( and host of @entity6 's " @entity5 , " which premieres thursday night ) is in the midst of an amazing box - office streak			0
he 's starred in four movies so far in 2013 — @entity10 ( feb. 22 ) , @entity11 : retaliation ( march 28 ) , @entity16 ( april 26 ) , and @entity17 ( may 24 ) — and while they have n't all been massive hits , three of them opened at no. 1			1
all together they 've grossed over $ 937 million worldwide , giving the @entity2 ( a.k.a. @entity2 ) some major box - office bragging rights			2
" as you know , i 've been around for some time now , " the @entity2 told @entity0 recently			2
" this is my 12th and 13th year in the business			0
building an empire was the goal			1
" and built an empire he has ! in fact , for the past 15 weekends — yes , since feb. 22 — the @entity2 has had at least one movie in the @entity31 at the @entity33 box office			2
and considering audiences ' enduring love of the @entity38 franchise , he 's got a few more weekends left before that streak ends , too			0
here 's how it 's all worked out : feb. 22 - 24 -- snitch ( no. 2 ) mar. 1 - 3 -- snitch ( no. 4 ) mar. 8 - 10 -- snitch ( no. 5 ) mar. 15 - 17 -- snitch ( no. 6 ) mar. 22 - 24 -- snitch ( no. 10 ) mar. 29 - 31 -- @entity11 : retaliation ( no. 1 ) apr. 5 - 7 -- @entity11 : retaliation ( no. 2 ) apr. 12 - 14 -- @entity11 : retaliation ( no. 4 ) apr. 19 - 21 -- @entity11 : retaliation ( no. 5 ) apr. 26 - 28 -- @entity16 ( no. 1 ) , @entity11 : retaliation ( no. 6 ) may 3 - 5 -- @entity16 ( no. 2 ) may 10 - 12 -- @entity16 ( no. 3 ) may 17 - 19 -- @entity16 ( no. 4 ) may 24 - 26 -- @entity17 ( no. 1 ) june 1 - 3 -- @entity17 ( no. 1 ) pretty incredible , right ? if that 's somehow not enough to convince you that the @entity2 is winning pop culture right now , then take a look at his @entity48 stream			1
it 's pretty much the best thing on the internet , and that should count for something ! see the original story at @entity0			0
