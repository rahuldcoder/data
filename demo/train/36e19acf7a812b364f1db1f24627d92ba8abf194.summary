-- @entity1 says his 11 - hour match at @entity3 against @entity4 was " absolutely crazy " and at one point he thought it might never end			1
the world number 23 from the @entity7 has gone down in the record books as the winner of the longest match in tennis history			1
his epic battle with @entity13 on @entity14 at the @entity15 stretched over three days and 183 games before he claimed the first round clash , 6 - 4 3 - 6 6 - 7 7 - 6 70 - 68			1
@entity1 told @entity0 that the first day of action on tuesday june 22 was a " pretty standard four - set match suspended by darkness which happens at @entity3			1
" but nothing could have prepared the man from @entity23 for the incredible events that were to unfurl in the fifth set the following day			0
the pair battled for over seven hours and by the time it was called off all the record books had already been re-written			0
" that one set just did n't want to end , we played 118 games with no decider and we had to come back next day to finish it off , " @entity1 explained to @entity0			1
" i think once we got to 30 ( games ) all i really did n't think it was going to end			0
" both of us were serving fantastic and it got to the point when we did n't want to make a mistake on our service game			0
" we were still able to hit an inordinate amount of aces and every time someone got in a jam we were able to claw our way out of it			0
the marathon eventually ended on the thursday afternoon as @entity1 finally made a breakthrough on @entity4 's service at match point , but not before another 20 games had been completed			1
an exhausted @entity1 lost his second round match the next day in straight sets , but his incredible feat of endurance against @entity4 will always be remembered			1
the 25 - year - old said he had prepared for @entity3 by training near his home in @entity58 , @entity59 , hitting ball after ball in the blazing heat and humidity			2
so fit was @entity1 that his coach @entity65 had made a prophetic prediction ahead of the third grand slam of the year			2
" my coach jokingly said i would be able to play for 10 hours because of the extreme conditions i was practicing in and sure enough he was right			0
" but the reality was both had played to the point of exhaustion and the giant @entity1 was suffering from agonizing blood blisters on both feet			0
" it was pretty brutal , it was ugly , " he said			0
after taking a well - earned break , @entity1 will resume play on the @entity80 later this month as he builds up to the third grand slam of the season at the @entity83 .			2
