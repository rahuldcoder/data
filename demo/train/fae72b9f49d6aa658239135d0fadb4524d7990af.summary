@entity0 -- the editor of an @entity4 magazine that has caused an uproar by publishing vacation photos of a bikini - clad @entity7 , with her baby bump visible accused the international media wednesday of overreacting			1
chi editor - in - chief @entity10 said the photos were not scandalous , do not " wrong the image " of the royal couple and " portray a couple in love in a happy moment while they are walking on the beach			1
" the photos were taken on a public beach and bought from an international agency , he said			2
" we can not talk about violation of privacy when we publish pictures of public people in a public place , out in the open as it is the case of a beach that is visited by other people , " he said			1
@entity32 -- which represents @entity7 , her husband , prince @entity34 , and his brother , @entity36 -- responded with dismay tuesday to news that the photos would be released			1
" we are disappointed that photographs of the @entity42 and @entity7 on a private holiday look likely to be published overseas , " a palace representative said			1
" this is a clear breach of the couple 's right to privacy			2
" despite the royal family 's objections , an @entity48 magazine said it too would be publishing the images			0
@entity52 said it had won @entity48 publishing rights after two days of " furious bidding " between three magazines			0
" it 's ticking all the boxes , it 's @entity7 who we love and adore , who 's a fantastic cover girl , a great seller			2
it 's a bikini shot , a beach shot , beautiful crystal blue water			0
it 's the bump that we 've been waiting to see for such a long time , " @entity52 editor @entity65 told @entity48 's @entity66			2
it was not immediately clear when or exactly where the pictures were taken			0
@entity74 and @entity75 media -- including @entity76 , like @entity1 a division of @entity78 -- reported that the royal couple recently vacationed on the secluded @entity81 isle of @entity82			0
@entity65 said the images were taken at a public beach where the royal couple was mingling with other holidaymakers , describing the decision to publish them as " very easy			0
" she added : " @entity48 are so much more laid back about seeing bikinis and beach shots than the @entity74 are			0
i think there 's a bit of hypersensitivity over this particular set ( of photos )			0
" @entity74 newspapers did not reproduce the images but wrote of the royal couple 's anguish about the breach of privacy			0
and broadcaster @entity102 issued an apology after its " @entity109 " show " accidentally showed an unblurred image of the magazine cover , which briefly showed the photographs			2
" this was a deeply regrettable error and we are very sorry , " it said			0
on tuesday , @entity113 described the photos as " extraordinary images of the @entity42 and @entity7 during their dream holiday in the @entity81			1
" " the future mum , now in her fourth month of pregnancy , wears a small bikini that enhances her now visible bump , " the magazine said			1
@entity122 , whose maiden name is @entity7 , has kept a low profile since the announcement in december that she is set to give birth to her first child in july			2
images showing any evidence of a baby bump have been hard to come by in that time			1
the @entity113 photos , though , are not her first encounter with paparazzi , which tracked her during her long courtship with @entity34 , their engagement and their time since april 2011 as a married couple			1
the highest - profile example came in september 2012 , when the @entity141 magazine closer ran photographs of @entity7 privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with @entity34 in @entity141			1
besides that magazine , some of those photos also were published in the @entity148 newspaper and @entity113 , which according to its parent company @entity149 is a women 's magazine with an average circulation of more than 218,000 and a readership well beyond that			1
soon after the photos came out , the @entity42 and @entity7 took legal action against @entity140 , which was fined by a @entity141 court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online			1
it was also told to hand over the photos to the royals			0
