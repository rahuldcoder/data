for @entity1 , the calculation was clear			1
he had won power in @entity3 by outmaneuvering rivals and , when necessary , using force			1
his son would not have to repeat those steps to win power -- but likely would have to emulate his father to remain as president			0
@entity11 groomed his son , gave him a military pedigree , toughened him			0
the son in question was not @entity17 , the man now leading @entity3 in a spiraling civil war and toward a possible military strike by the @entity20			1
the son @entity21 wanted to be president was his first - born , @entity23			1
analysts say @entity1 was closest to @entity23			1
@entity17 , as a child , was shy and modest			1
the father had a distant relationship with him			0
first on @entity28 : videos of chemical attack effects that changed in 1994 , when @entity32 , always known to be reckless as well as cruel , was killed while driving at a high speed toward the @entity35 airport to see his girlfriend			0
@entity3 would not have the strongman @entity21 envisioned			1
it would fall to @entity17 , the reluctant heir who really wanted to be an ophthamologist			1
when @entity1 died of a heart attack in june 2000 , @entity17 inherited a regime built on fierce loyalty -- to family and religious sect			1
@entity21 had been born into a poor family from the @entity47 mountains in northwestern @entity3			1
the @entity47 had often been looked down upon by the wealthier , majority @entity48 in @entity3 , and @entity1 was determined to break the mold			1
he joined the @entity52 and then rose through the ranks of the @entity3 air force			1
but it was hardly that straightforward			0
the man thrived in the backrooms of @entity3 palace intrigue where , according to most accounts , betraying friends and killing or banishing enemies put you on the fast track to success			2
@entity65 was careful with @entity20 in @entity3 , analysts say , there were more than 20 successful and unsuccessful coups between 1949 and 1970 , when @entity1 took power			1
he was involved in three of them himself			0
once in power , @entity1 proved to be one of the most cunning , ruthless dictators in a region full of them			2
he crushed a 1982 rebellion by the @entity77 in the city of @entity79 by laying siege to the city and killing more than 10,000 of his own people			0
at different times he waged war against , and negotiated peace with @entity85			0
@entity86 urges strong response ; @entity88 seeks support for military action he made fast friends with @entity92 , which the @entity20 considers a terrorist group			0
but he also made sure the @entity20 was never a full - fledged enemy			0
in the 1970s and ' 80s he did that by sending his forces to the aid of embattled @entity97 in @entity98			0
and in 1990 and 1991 , when president @entity99 was building a coalition against @entity101 , @entity1 committed 2,000 troops to the coalition side			2
the administrations of both @entity106 and @entity107 have , at different periods , engaged in diplomacy with @entity17 's regime and pushed away from it			2
the @entity99 team reached out in 2003 when it needed an ally against @entity114			0
in the early years of the @entity107 administration , sen. @entity88 -- the man now calling @entity17 a " thug and a murderer " -- was the point man in the administration 's efforts to cultivate the @entity3 dictator			1
there is a telling image from that period : a photograph taken in early 2009 of @entity88 and his wife , @entity125 , having an intimate dinner in @entity35 with @entity17 and his glamorous , @entity128 - born wife , @entity127			2
several scenarios possible how did it all unravel ? analysts say the civil war is partially the result of old resentments			0
much of the majority @entity48 population is embittered after decades under the rule of a despotic family from a small minority , the @entity47			2
but @entity17 also had trouble changing the old ways of his father			2
" @entity1 stabilized @entity3 through a closed system			1
they could n't communicate very well			0
international news was very limited " , says @entity145 of the @entity146			0
chemical weapons : the desperate army 's escape from stalemate @entity145 , who wrote an inside account of the @entity1 regime entitled " in the @entity162 , " says , " when @entity17 came to power , he lifted the restrictions on travel , allowed people to read international newspapers , satellite television and the @entity159			1
and it opened @entity3 ' minds			2
but how do you control this system ? and how do you basically perpetuate authoritarian and tyrannical rule ? " @entity107 has called on @entity168 to back plans to punish @entity1 militarily for an alleged chemical weapons attack in his own country			1
meanwhile , his regime is locked in a bloody fight with rebels			0
more than 100,000 @entity3 have died , according to the @entity175			2
how does it end for the @entity177 ? there are several possibilities			0
@entity17 could fight to the end , lose and be killed			0
he could eventually flee the country and be given refuge in @entity183 , @entity184 or @entity185			0
@entity145 says if he does , @entity3 wo n't look the same			0
" i think at the moment , what 's likely to happen is that the @entity1 family will rule over part of @entity3 for the foreseeable future , " says @entity145			1
" but they 're never going to rule over all of geographic @entity3 again			1

@entity1 ruled @entity3 for decades with iron fist
he hoped his son , @entity23 , would succeed him
@entity17 made some *reforms* , but he has continued authoritarian rule
