-- on thursday , @entity2 's much - discussed new privacy policy goes into effect			1
to say that the change has stirred concern on the @entity6 would be an understatement			1
public officials and web watchdogs in the @entity10 and elsewhere have expressed fears that it will mean less privacy for users of the web giant 's multitude of products , from search to @entity19 to @entity20 to @entity21 to smartphones powered by the @entity24 operating system			1
@entity2 points out that the products wo n't be collecting any more data about users than they were before			1
and , in fairness , the company has gone out of its way to prominently announce the product across all of its platforms for weeks			0
the major change is that , instead of profiling users separately on each of its sites and products , @entity2 will now pull all of that information together into one single profile , similar to what 's found on @entity2 's dashboard page			1
the result encapsulates perhaps the most basic conundrum of the modern web			0
more information means better service ( and potentially , more targeted advertisements )			0
but that service ( in this case more accurate search results , more interesting ads and new features that work across multiple sites ) requires you to give up some of your privacy in return			1
@entity58 chairman @entity57 has called it " a somewhat brutal choice			0
" @entity2 , not surprisingly , takes a different tack : the payoff for the company collecting your data is cool new services			2
for example , they could push cooking videos to you on @entity20 if you 'd been looking for recipes through @entity2 search , privacy director @entity67 wrote in an editorial for the @entity75			1
" we just want to use the information you already trust us with to make your experience better , " she wrote			0
" if you do n't think information sharing will improve your experience , you do n't need to sign in to use services like @entity83 , @entity21 and @entity20			0
" if you are signed in , you can use our many privacy tools to do things like edit or turn off your search history , control the way @entity2 tailors ads to your interests and browse the @entity6 ' incognito ' using @entity91			1
" wednesday is the last day for people to tweak those @entity2 settings before the new policy begins , although they can change them afterward as well			1
here are a few tips on how to keep your data a little more private on some of @entity2 's most popular features			2
do n't sign in this is the easiest and most effective tip. many of @entity2 's services -- most notably search , @entity20 and @entity21 -- do n't require you to sign in to use them			1
if you 're not logged in , via @entity19 or @entity104 , for example , @entity2 does n't know who you are and ca n't add data to your profile			1
but to take a little more direct action ... removing your @entity2 search history @entity110 of the @entity111 has compiled a step - by - step guide to deleting and disabling your web history , which includes the searches you 've done and sites you 've visited			1
it 's pretty quick and easy : -- sign in to your @entity2 account -- go to www.google.com/history -- click " remove all web history " -- click " ok " as the @entity111 notes , deleting your history will not prevent @entity2 from using the information internally			1
but it will limit the amount of time that it 's fully accessible			0
after 18 months , the data will become anonymous again and wo n't be used as part of your profile			2
six tips to protect your search privacy ( from the @entity111 ) clearing your @entity20 history similarly , users may want to remove their history on @entity20			1
that 's also pretty quick and easy			0
-- sign in on @entity2 's main page -- click on " @entity20 " in the toolbar at the top of the page -- on the right of the page , click your user name and select " video manager " -- click " history " on the left of the page and then " @entity148 " -- refresh the page and then click " @entity150 " -- you can clear your searches on @entity20 by going back and choosing " @entity153 " and doing the same steps			2
clearing your browsing history on @entity91 -- click on the " wrench " icon at the far right of your toolbar -- select " tools " -- select " @entity148 browsing data " -- in the dialogue box that appears , click the " clear browsing data " box ( there are other options you may want to use as well ) -- select " @entity169 " to clear your entire browsing history -- click " clear browsing history " @entity171 when you start a chat with someone , you can make the conversation " off the record			2
" off - the - record chats will not be stored in your chat history or the history of the person with whom you 're talking			0
all chats with that person will remain off the record until you change the status			0
to go off the record : -- click the " actions " link at the top right of the chat window -- scroll down to " go off the record			0
" both you and your chat partner will see that the chat has been taken off the record			0
what are @entity2 's other products ? obviously , anything with " @entity2 " in its name counts			2
but the web giant owns other products that might not be so obvious to some folks			0
yes , the " g " is for @entity2			2
@entity2 bought the @entity6 's leading video site in 2006 -- @entity204			1
the online photo sharing site became @entity2 's in 2004 -- blogger			2
the blog publishing tool has been @entity2 's since 2003			2
a management tool for bloggers and managing rss feeds			0
@entity2 bought it in 2007			0
@entity2 's original social - networking site is n't big in the @entity10 but it 's one of the most popular sites in @entity216 and @entity217			1
yes , you probably know this			0
but just for the record , @entity2 owns the most popular smartphone operating system .			0
