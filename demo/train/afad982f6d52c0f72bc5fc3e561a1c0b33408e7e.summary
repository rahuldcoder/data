@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 can be a cruel game with winners and losers			1
and in @entity0 , there is @entity8 , 80 and his wife @entity9 , 79			1
the elderly couple are experiencing a cruel sense of déjà vu , certainly not in keeping with the @entity3 spirit			0
" why do we need another @entity3 here ? " @entity15 asked , referring to the recent decision to award the @entity17 to the city in 2020			2
" there are still many people there up in @entity22 ( the northern @entity1 area hit by the 2011 earthquake )			2
the money should be spent there , not here			0
" their lack of enthusiasm stems from bitter memories of their first eviction			0
@entity8 's family home was razed to make way for the @entity35 ahead of the ' 64 games			1
they were one of the last to leave the area after fighting in court			2
he also lost his tobacco shop to the construction project and had to start anew			2
the family eventually agreed to move after the city government found a new apartment for them			0
and nearly 50 years later , the aging couple is being asked to do it all over again			0
plans to expand the existing @entity35 means accommodating 80,000 spectators under an all - weather roof , which is the standard for hosting the opening ceremony			0
and that also means the couple 's current apartment , which is owned by the @entity0 government , is in an area at the heart of that project			1
@entity8 's small tobacco shop at the ground level of the @entity61 , is also to be demolished for the expanded stadium			1
" there was only one explanation session held by the government so far , and that 's it , " said @entity15			0
a @entity0 housing official said that the government has been talking to the residents of @entity69 since last summer when the project for the new stadium was revealed and that it has shown options to the residents to move			2
the couple will be close to 90 by the time the @entity3 returns to their neighborhood			0
@entity8 says they have no energy left to fight another drawn - out court case			1
he can not open a new tobacco shop , because such businesses are heavily regulated			2
" i do n't want to see another @entity3 , " he said			0
" the money should be spent on the people who are still suffering after the quake and tsunami			0
" soon , they 'll have to leave their apartment , the open balcony where they 've gotten to know their neighbors for the last five decades			0
@entity8 will no longer take his daily stroll to his tobacco and public phone shop			1
earlier this month , the @entity93 pipped @entity0 over @entity94 and @entity95 for the right to host the world 's biggest sporting event in seven years			1
the city raised significant capital and was considered the safe choice , despite the ongoing concerns over high radiation levels at the stricken @entity105 nuclear plant			0
@entity0 's government had amassed a $ 4.9 billion @entity3 fund to prepare for the @entity3 , according to @entity108 , which covers the business and politics of the @entity3			1
the @entity0 bid has been touted as a way of breathing new life into the world 's third - largest economy , which has been dogged by deflation , stagnation and the @entity105 leaks in recent years			1
when @entity0 won the @entity3 bid , crowds at the capital welcomed the news , cheering and holding signs reading " we 're waiting for the world to come to @entity0 in 2020			1
" instead , @entity15 felt shock			0
" i did not think @entity0 would win and the @entity3 would come here again			2
" @entity2 's @entity126 reported from @entity1 and @entity127 wrote from @entity128 .			1
