-- for all the cheers , roars and ovations in all the @entity2 stadiums and arenas over all the years , perhaps the most significant @entity2 sound heard in the last quarter - century was a yawn			1
because a yawn , symbolically , was how the public greeted what might have been the most controversial change in rules that the @entity14 ever instituted			0
the one firm rule that always governed the @entity2 was that amateur athletes were permitted to compete			1
that 's what made the @entity20 the @entity2			1
and the fans , far from protesting in outrage at the change , did n't care			0
in fact , they seemed to like it a lot			0
in the @entity2 eras before television , athletes who accepted money for their performances might as well have been lepers , in the eyes of the @entity14			1
if it was discovered that you got paid for playing , or that you accepted commercial endorsements , you were shunned , banished , cast to the cold winds			0
in the most famous example of the inflexibility of the @entity2 organizers , @entity42 , perhaps @entity43 's finest athlete of all time , had his gold medals in the decathlon and pentathlon in the @entity48 stripped , and his achievements nullified , because he had once accepted small amounts of money for playing semi-pro baseball during his college summers			1
the medals were reinstated in 1983 -- 30 years after his death , 30 years after the moment could have given him any comfort			0
@entity60 starts final leg before @entity20 open it may be hard for young viewers of this summer 's @entity20 to imagine , but all the sponsorships , advertisements and marketing hoopla that are a standard part of big - dollar contemporary @entity2 were thought to be an insult to the @entity2 spirit not so long ago			1
the @entity20 were supposed to be about love of sport , not love of money			1
the president of the @entity14 during the years of television 's phenomenal growth was an @entity43 , @entity77 , and the guiding principle of his reign ( 1952 - 1972 ) was what was called the " amateur code			0
" he was unbendable on the subject			0
in a 1955 speech , @entity77 said : " we can only rely on the support of those who believe in the principles of fair play and sportsmanship embodied in the amateur code in our efforts to prevent the @entity2 from being used by individuals , organizations or nations for ulterior motives			1
" meaning : to make money			1
but once @entity77 was gone , the floodgates opened			0
the @entity14 , after his regime , realized that commercial interests could turn the @entity20 into a bottomless goldmine			1
and to bring in viewers , it was determined that an effective lure would be the presence of the greatest and most famous athletes in the world			2
many of whom are professionals			0
" the pros are there for a reason , " the esteemed sports journalist @entity109 , who has covered six olympics , told me the other night			2
" people will tune in to watch athletes they know			2
the pro athletes are pre-sold to the public , which means increased viewership			1
" what made it an easy sell was the suspicion that athletes from certain @entity126 nations were de facto professionals anyway : they were supported full - time by their governments to train and compete			1
so , by the end of the 1980s , the move toward professionalization of the @entity20 had gained full steam			1
which seemed to be just fine with the fans			0
if the best athletes were paid for their skills , or for granting endorsements , why not ? the concept of " selling out " -- once such a pejorative -- had become almost meaningless			2
making a lot of money for being good at a sport was a badge of honor			0
when the @entity146 of @entity148 players from the @entity43 went to the @entity149 in 1992 , the transformation was complete			0
if you spent any time around the members of the @entity146 in the months leading up to the @entity20 , you could n't help noticing that they were not exactly a bundle of nerves			2
they were going to win , and they knew it -- @entity157 spent much of his time in @entity159 either playing in all - night card games or getting in 36 holes of golf a day			0
the @entity20 were a very successful business trip for @entity43 basketball interests ; the real dream was the one realized by @entity167 , the @entity148 commissioner			2
the 1992 @entity20 were the best global marketing tool the @entity148 ever had			2
( many people point to the fact that the @entity146 won their games by an average of almost 44 points as the most remarkable statistic of those @entity20			1
i 've always thought that there was an even more extraordinary one : @entity177 was so good that its head coach , @entity178 , did not call a single timeout during the entire @entity2 tournament			2
) of course the problem with the @entity146 , and its successors representing the @entity43 in @entity2 basketball , is that they are automatic overdogs			2
the world outside the @entity43 would love to see them lose -- it 's " break up the @entity188 , " on a planetary scale			0
the amateur @entity43 ice hockey team at @entity190 in the @entity191 -- the " do you believe in miracles ? " team -- was cherished because they won when they were said to have no chance			0
no @entity2 team of @entity43 basketball pros will ever know that feeling ; the " do you believe in miracles ? " emotion will be reserved for teams who are trying to knock them off			1
the size and scope and riches of the 21st century @entity20 are a far cry from how the games began , and there 's no going back			1
few people seem to want to			0
there would be a sure - fire way to restore what was seen as the purity , and the love of competition for competition 's sake , of the early @entity20 -- a way to drive the marketers and merchandisers and global sponsors away so that the @entity2 would simply be games again			1
all the @entity14 would have to do is add a short sentence to the @entity225 : " the @entity2 shall not be televised			1
" that would do it			0
meanwhile , back in the real world , the opening ceremonies in @entity228 will be held on friday			0
rumor has it that they 'll be on television			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity235 : for decades , the @entity2 banned professional athletes
he says the *decision* to admit pros changed the nature of the games
@entity235 : having pro athletes compete increases *potential* for games to make money
he says as long as the @entity20 are televised , pros will be there to compete
