@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands of anti-riot police were in the streets of @entity1 's capital city thursday as the opposition alliance launched a day - long general strike in protest of a fuel price hike			1
the strike , occurring all over the country , paralyzed daily life as road communications were heavily disrupted and schools and business establishments remained closed on thursday , the last working day of the week			0
the usually busy streets of the capital , @entity0 , looked almost deserted as most means of public and private transportation remained off the roads			1
the opposition group @entity21 and its allies , mostly @entity23 parties , called the strike after the government raised the price of petroleum fuels and compressed national gas on sunday			0
@entity0 's police chief , @entity29 , said his department deployed 13,000 policemen alone in the capital to break up any opposition protests , and the home ministry also initiated mobile courts to try protesters summarily on the streets			1
police said that the strike was mostly peaceful apart from a few incidents of violence , but the opposition parties said the police and the ruling party men beat up their activists wherever they had tried to bring out a procession			2
police said they had arrested some 200 people from different parts of the country , but the opposition claimed that the number was at least 400			2
the @entity21 acting secretary general , @entity53 , said , " the government has increased fuel prices at a time when people 's suffering has already peaked due to high inflation			1
" but the government said it was an " issueless " strike			0
the general secretary of the ruling @entity63 , @entity62 , said it was illogical as the prices of fuel oils were still lower in @entity1 ( a liter of gasoline costs us $ 1.06 ) than in the international market			2
" if the prices of fuel oils increase in the global market in the future , the government will increase the prices again because the government will need to pay huge subsidies otherwise , " he added			0
the fuel price hike , the second such rise in four months , triggered protests also by transport owners .			0
