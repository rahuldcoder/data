as a non-sports aficionado , my attraction to game day festivities has been solely food focused			0
so naturally , i noticed how potato chips have taken less and less space on the snack table to make room for tortilla chips and guacamole			1
although potato chips continue to be the top - selling salted snack in terms of pounds sold , tortilla chips have been increasing in sales at a faster pace than potato chips , especially during this time of year , according to @entity17 , ceo of the @entity18			1
and , it 's not just tortilla chips selling at such high rates either			1
make homemade tortilla chips tortillas -- not the chips but the round flat breads used to wrap burritos - have been outselling hamburger and hot dog buns at supermarkets and retail food stores since 2010			1
and salsa has been the new ketchup since 2008 , according @entity33 , ceo of the @entity34			0
one of the factors that contributes to that growth is immigration			0
as the @entity39 population grows , so will the variety of foods that cater to them			1
especially since the @entity45 - @entity44 population makes up the largest @entity47 group in the @entity44			1
another factor that plays into the growth is that non-hispanics have become more adventurous eaters , and companies want to cater to that , @entity33 said			1
while @entity45 food in the @entity44 has become ubiquitously @entity44 as apple pie , the backstory of how the crispy golden corn chip became the go - to snack chip has n't really been told			0
in an effort to tell that story , nationally syndicated columnist of ยก ask a @entity45 ! @entity63 wrote the book " @entity65 : how @entity45 conquered @entity44			0
" in the early 1900s , tortilla chips were already being manufactured and distributed to local restaurants in southern @entity68 but were never really a big deal			1
in fact , their creation was even an afterthought			0
these tostadas , as they are called in @entity75 , were made from leftover tortilla dough			2
it was n't long before @entity80 executives noticed how everyone in those southern @entity68 restaurants was gobbling up tostadas , so they decided to make the chips , too			2
they called their product " @entity86 , " @entity87 for " little golden things			0
" although few consider @entity86 a tortilla chip , under all that cheesy seasoning is an oppressed golden tortilla chip - the first to be launched nationally in the @entity44			2
shortly thereafter , tortilla chips made by other companies started to gain popularity - mostly driven by the rise of salsa , refried beans , and guacamole			1
but when nachos made their debut , it took tortillas chips to the next level			1
@entity105 note : nachos were a delicious accident			0
when two @entity44 customers walked into his restaurant in @entity75 , head waiter @entity108 could n't find the chef so he threw together some random ingredients and called them " @entity113 , " @entity63 said			0
and the rest is history			0
today , every @entity117 stadium and @entity118 offers nachos			0
they 're the third - largest concession seller overall , after popcorn and soda , outselling even hot dogs , @entity63 notes			2
the rapid rise of nachos and guacamole persuaded @entity80 to make their own light , airy , slightly unseasoned tortilla chips			1
the @entity44 company named them " @entity133 " and marketed them as " authentic			0
" @entity80 then hired @entity45 - born , @entity44 - raised actor @entity134 - who had a slight @entity87 accent - to do a series of commercials and it worked			0
it did n't hurt that @entity134 also owned two @entity45 restaurants either			0
" @entity133 remains the biggest brand ... and it all started in the mid- 1970s as a way to offer a more authentic alternative than @entity86 , " @entity63 told @entity4			0
" through clever marketing , they took over the tortilla chip business			2
" doritos still continue to be the best - selling tortilla chips and @entity133 and @entity148 follow - all under the @entity80 empire			1
who invented the tortilla chip ? the origin of the tortilla chip gets a bit complicated because like every tale in history , there are two sides to every story			2
while many have credited @entity162 as the inventor and innovator of the tortilla chip , the @entity160 claims its family 's tortilla company made the famous corn chips long before that , @entity63 wrote in @entity65			1
@entity170 , owner of the @entity160 , claims he was the first to produce masolina to make tortillas , where you would only have to add water and masa emerged			2
all that production meant excess masa so @entity170 decided to make tortilla chips as to not be wasteful			1
the @entity170 family only recently donated materials to trademark the @entity183 brand of tortilla chip			2
while the tortilla chip 's history is still a bit blurry , @entity80 's heavy marketing and branding has been so influential that many people refer to tortilla chips as " @entity133 , " even if they are n't buying the @entity80 brand			1
potato chips keep things interesting not only does @entity80 have the corner on the tortilla chip market , but it owns the leading potato chip brands : fritos , baked ! , @entity200 and , their most popular brand , @entity202 's			1
and they are n't taking the rise of the tortilla chip lightly			2
" potato chip companies have become creative in their advertising , even going as far as changing the shape of their chips to triangles or mixing ingredients to make a hybrid chip , " @entity33 said			2
in 2014 , consumers could even name their flavor as part of @entity202 's " @entity220 " contest , which got a lot of bizarre entries			0
kettle brand is one of the few companies that is n't owned by @entity80 , and even though potato chip sales fell below tortilla chips recently , the company has focused its energy on two vital chip components : structure and flavor			1
" the thick - cut and crunch of our chips also means they stand up really well against popular dips that have a tendency to make other chips crumble , " @entity222 's brand manager @entity230 told @entity4			2
@entity222 has also built up a reputation for bold flavors - @entity240 - and @entity230 said they 'll keep doing that to keep up with the competition			0
while they 're known for their kettle - style potato chips , @entity222 also sells tortilla chips , which they market as the " healthier alternative			1
" " unlike other plain tortilla chips brands , we focus on all - natural , organic and carry @entity248 ingredients , " @entity230 said			1
after all , who would n't want to get a piece of the tortilla chip 's multibillion - dollar industry that is exponentially expanding year after year ? to each their own , i say			0
granted , i 'm not complaining			0
i love tortillas chips and potato chips , in every shape , size and flavor			1
but i 'm keeping an eye on the snack table in case these tostadas make a full - blown culinary takeover during game day			0
