-- an alleged letter from president @entity2 to @entity4 supreme leader ayatollah @entity3 has prompted consternation not just in @entity6 , but also @entity7 and @entity8			1
according to the @entity9 , @entity2 pointed out some common @entity11 and @entity4 interests in defeating the extremist @entity12 -- which calls itself the @entity14 -- and reportedly also suggested that a nuclear accord between @entity4 and the @entity16 ( @entity11 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 ) could result in cooperation on regional issues between @entity6 and @entity24			1
but the move has , according to one @entity26 source quoted by @entity0 , sent " shock waves " through @entity6			0
why ? the alleged letter comes despite a consistent message from the @entity31 and @entity11 's top nuclear negotiators that nuclear talks would not be linked to larger regional issues on which @entity4 may possess greater leverage			1
and while it is not surprising the letter has upset domestic critics of the negotiations , the alleged correspondence has also unsettled @entity40 and @entity41 , which fear a " bad " deal with @entity4 and even secret collusion between @entity6 and @entity24			1
but such concerns seem unfounded			0
for a start , @entity6 has plenty of leverage to negotiate a good deal with @entity4 that constrains its nuclear program			2
just as important , though , is that the @entity11 has an opportunity not only to resolve the nuclear issue , but also to defuse tensions with @entity4 while maintaining @entity11 's bonds with its traditional partners			1
the reality is that the nuclear negotiations between @entity4 and the @entity11 are not the result of a newfound friendship			1
instead , the international sanctions regime against @entity4 has given it an incentive to compromise on its nuclear program			2
and although the election of @entity63 as president has also helped , it 's not clear that @entity63 's presidency without sanctions pressure would have gotten the negotiations as far as they have come			2
of course , even after a deal , @entity6 and @entity24 will face real differences over their respective policies in the @entity72 ; a return of the kind of @entity11 - @entity4 alliance that was seen under the former @entity76 is highly unlikely			1
yet the @entity11 does n't have to like or agree with the @entity4 regime 's policies in order to have some sort of relationship with it			1
after all , despite increasing tensions on a range of issues , @entity6 still maintains diplomatic ties to @entity87 and @entity88			0
and while @entity4 is not a great power , it does play a major role in nearly all the conflicts roiling the @entity72 , contributing to instability in the region			0
so , can the @entity11 provide enough inducements for @entity4 to change its ways in the region ? perhaps			2
although @entity4 has given the world plenty of reason to believe that it will simply go about its business as usual after a possible nuclear deal , it seems more likely that the combination of a deal , @entity63 's presidency , and public demand in @entity4 for real change would offer @entity6 an opportunity to exact real changes from the regime			2
such optimism might not be shared by @entity4 's regional neighbors -- especially @entity40 and @entity41			1
@entity40 officials especially these days tend to portray the @entity4 regime in the starkest terms possible			0
but both countries will sooner or later have to accept that @entity4 as a country is not going to go anywhere , and so crafting policies that encourage its evolution into a more open , tolerant and cooperative country is in the long - term interests not just of the @entity11 , but the @entity72 as well			2
true , there are no guarantees that such an @entity4 will ever emerge			0
the government exercises tight control over the country , and in many ways @entity63 , while more pragmatic than other clerics , is still not as open and reform - minded as the @entity128 would like			0
yet anyone who visits @entity4 these days will surely see a country that is very different from the images that have been etched into the @entity11 psyche			2
scenes like the burning of @entity11 flags do occur			0
but @entity4 is much bigger and more complex than the black - and - white presentations of it by much of the media			0
@entity0 host @entity139 's recent culinary trip in " @entity140 " was a great example of this			0
communicating with one 's adversaries is n't a sign of weakness ; in order to compel certain behavior , one has to communicate what that desired behavior is			0
but even if @entity4 does not accept a compromise by the november 24 deadline for the talks , @entity11 will still have greater leverage over @entity24 than it has ever had , and will be able to portray @entity4 as the intransigent party to the international community			1
all this suggests that the @entity11 has a real opportunity not only to put the brakes on @entity4 's nuclear pursuits , but also to bolster larger @entity11 goals			1
and the problem lies not in @entity2 's letter to @entity3 , but the fearful reaction it has produced ; it is time to take a deep breath and consider the success that has been achieved so far in bringing @entity4 to the table on the nuclear issue			1
@entity3 might claim the letter is a sign of strength to his followers			0
but in reality he has been pushed into a corner .			0
