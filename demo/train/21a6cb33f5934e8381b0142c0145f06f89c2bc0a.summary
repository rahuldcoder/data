@entity0 -- first come the blackouts , then come the blues ... at least from worried business owners in disaster - hit @entity5			1
in the end , the rolling outages may wind up being a bigger drag on the @entity5 economy than the initial damage from the march 11 earthquake and tsunami			1
the area that relies on electric power from the @entity15 , including @entity0 , accounts for more than half the economy of @entity5 , so any outages have long - ranging and sometimes unexpected consequences			1
a fast - food noodle factory in @entity20 , just north of @entity0 , is but one example			1
for 63 years , the @entity22 has turned out precooked noodle dishes with fresh ingredients for sale in convenience stores			0
but managing director @entity27 said the family business is at risk of shutting down and cutting hundreds of employees			2
@entity27 's problems run all up and down the intensely choreographed production chain			0
each day 300 workers at the spotless suburban factory turn out 80,000 packages of 120 varieties of noodle dishes , relying on dozens of vendors for ingredients			2
the factory lost some food and flour during the quake , but @entity27 said the days afterward were far harder to deal with at the plant			2
dozens of foreign workers fled back to their home countries after word spread of the dangerous and still ongoing nuclear crisis at the @entity51 plant			0
then pre-announced blackouts forced the factory to shut down for three - hour periods , often during peak production			1
and @entity27 said it takes hours before and after each shutdown to get the machines up and working			0
" our factory has no windows so we ca n't leave our workers inside , " @entity27 said			1
" we have to take them out to the office or the cafeteria , and for three hours we give them some food and drinks because we feel bad for them just waiting to start again			0
" the hourly employees get no pay for the wait			0
and most are mothers , often with children in the company day care center who do n't have flexible schedules to work around blackouts			2
@entity80 , 38 , said she 's worried about the cuts and how to provide for her young son			2
" i think the planned blackouts are inevitable , and it seems working hours and income will go down , so we 're all worried about that , " she said while on break at the factory			0
and the problem 's not only in @entity20 -- the ingredients from farmers are also in constant flux			1
@entity27 explained they are scrambling to buy vegetables and meat from areas outside the affected prefectures where they had relied on food from before			0
fuel shortages and quake - damaged roads also hamper deliveries , blackouts let fresh foods spoil , and sometimes trucks are stuck behind electrically powered warehouse doors			0
then there are problems with how to get the goods to customers			0
@entity27 said many stores are shut and customers are short of cash across the @entity116 area , meaning revenues are taking a hit			0
@entity15 has been able largely to avoid blackouts in recent days as cool weather and customer cutbacks have led to nearly a 25 % reduction in demand around @entity0 , the company said			1
prime minister @entity125 said tuesday that he prefers industry and individuals to cut back voluntarily , but @entity15 has warned that as temperatures rise and air conditioners get switched on , companies may be forced to trim power use by a fifth , or face mandatory cuts			1
at the @entity136 factory , a few small generators sit outside with makeshift power chords snaking along the floor to ensure they can keep phones and computers working to take orders			0
but a generator large enough to power the factory would take months to find and deliver , and regulations ban big units near the apartments that crowd all around the plant			0
@entity27 said she 's tried to bring aid to the worst - hit tsunami areas , personally delivering tens of thousands of noodle packs to the survivors in the @entity116			2
but she said now the @entity5 government and @entity15 must help her and other small businesses out			1
" as you see in the factory , all the products come down a line , so if we 're asked for a 20 % reduction in power we have to stop everything , " @entity27 said , sighing			1
" we did n't suffer badly in the quake and have to do our part to help ... but we ca n't afford to cut 20 % and keep on in business			1

@entity167 outages have long - range and unexpected consequences to @entity5 's economy

" we ca n't afford to cut 20 % and keep on in business , " factory official says
