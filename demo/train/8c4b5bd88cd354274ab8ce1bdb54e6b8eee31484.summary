-- the terrorist attacks on @entity3 on september 11 , 2001 , gave his administration a clear goal and him the resolve to find out who was responsible and " kick their ass , " former president @entity1 writes in his new book			1
in " decision points , " @entity1 describes his reaction when his then - @entity13 informed him of the crash of a third airplane into the @entity16			1
" i sat back in my seat and absorbed her words			0
my thoughts clarified : the first plane could have been an accident			0
the second was definitely an attack			0
the third was a declaration of war , " the former president writes in his 481 - page book , which goes on sale tuesday			1
" my blood was boiling			1
we were going to find out who did this , and kick their ass , " @entity1 writes			1
" in a single morning , the purpose of my presidency had grown clear : to protect our people and defend our freedom that had come under attack			0
" @entity0 on friday obtained a copy of the book , being released by @entity42			0
in the book , @entity1 also recounts the government response to @entity45 in 2005			1
he calls the response " not only flawed " but " unacceptable , " and describes his own failures in this way : " as the leader of the federal government , i should have recognized the deficiencies sooner and intervened faster			2
i prided myself on my ability to make crisp and effective decisions			0
yet in the days after @entity45 , that did n't happen			1
the problem was not that i made the wrong decisions			0
it was that i took too long to decide			0
" @entity1 writes he also failed to " adequately communicate my concern for the victims of @entity45 " -- a problem he calls one of " perception , not reality			1
" " yet many of our citizens , particularly in the @entity69 - @entity3 community , came away convinced their president did n't care about them			2
" the former president recently told @entity73 's @entity72 that the " worst moment " of his administration was when rapper @entity74 declared during a @entity45 celebrity telethon that " @entity1 does n't care about black people			1
" @entity74 this week expressed a sympathetic view of @entity1 's reaction to the comment			2
@entity1 writes the @entity45 had a lasting legacy on his second term			1
" just as @entity45 was more than a hurricane , its impact was more than physical destruction			2
it eroded citizens ' trust in their government			0
it exacerbated divisions in our society and politics			0
and it cast a cloud over my second term			2
" in " decision points , " @entity1 also details how he came to utter those infamous words " @entity103 , you 're doing a heck of a job " about @entity103 , the @entity106 chief who was leading the government 's response to @entity45 in the days immediately following the storm			1
@entity1 writes that he was in @entity110 , @entity111 , meeting with the @entity111 and @entity113 governors and asked them if they were getting adequate federal support			1
" ' that @entity116 is doing a heck of a job , ' @entity115 said , " referring to @entity111 governor @entity120			0
" i knew @entity116 was under pressure and i wanted to boost his morale , " @entity1 writes , so he repeated @entity120 's words a few minutes later when he spoke to the press			1
" i never imagined those words of encouragement would become an infamous entry in the political lexicon			0
as complaints about @entity116 's performance mounted , especially in @entity132 , critics turned my words of encouragement into a club to bludgeon me			0
" the former @entity106 head , who resigned two weeks after the compliment , told @entity0 in august that he winced when @entity1 uttered the line			2
" i knew the minute he said that , the media and everybody else would see a disconnect between what he was saying and what i was witnessing on the ground , " @entity103 said			0
" that 's the president 's style			2
his attitude and demeanor is always one of being a cheerleader and trying to encourage people to keep moving			0
it was just the wrong time and the wrong place			0
" @entity1 in recent years has talked about his past problems with alcohol abuse and his 1986 decision to give up drinking completely			2
just days before the 2000 presidential election , news broke that @entity1 had been arrested for driving under the influence in @entity163 in 1976			1
in his memoir , @entity1 writes , " not disclosing the @entity164 on my terms may have been the single costliest political mistake i ever made			1
" he says he had decided against doing so because he did n't want to undermine his admonitions to his daughters about drinking and driving			0
after the news came out -- so close to election day , @entity1 writes , he went to bed that night on the campaign trail thinking , " i may have just cost myself the presidency			1

his blood was boiling after the 9/11 attacks , former president writes
@entity1 said response to @entity45 clouded his second term
he *feared* news of 1976 @entity164 arrest would cost him the 2000 election
