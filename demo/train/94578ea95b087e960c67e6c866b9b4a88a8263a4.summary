@entity1 , @entity0 -- as @entity4 prepares to take over the @entity6 mission , alliance officials said friday they are considering a broader role that goes beyond enforcement of a no - fly zone			1
after days of acrimonious discussion , @entity4 officials hailed their decision to take command as swift and historic and vowed a " seamless " transition of leadership from the @entity16 to @entity4 , which could happen as early as sunday			1
" in the course of a single week @entity4 allies have launched both the arms embargo and the no - fly zone operations , " said @entity4 spokeswoman @entity17			1
" this is a clear demonstration of the allies commitment to fulfill their obligations under the @entity27 mandate and to show their resolve to do what it takes to protect the people of @entity6			2
" but whether @entity4 will assume the role of protecting civilians on the ground -- as mandated by a @entity36 resolution -- remains at issue			1
the operational heart of the mission could hinge on if and when to intervene with airstrikes when civilians appear to be at risk			2
a decision on what @entity4 officials are calling " no - fly plus " could come as early as sunday after a meeting of @entity4 ambassadors			1
@entity4 and @entity16 officials say discussions are ongoing to bring the entire mission under @entity4 control			1
a senior @entity16 administration official said that while countries have agreed @entity4 will take over the rest of the mission , " there are a couple more steps in the planning process that will need to be taken			1
" a senior @entity16 defense official said that @entity4 's announcement " has not caused any change to our operations			2
" " they 're just taking over an operation that 's for the most part , already established , " the official explained			0
beyond that , tense exchanges are also expected at a summit in @entity70 next week , where officials will try to lay out how far they are willing to go militarily against @entity72			0
" we expect that ministers will set the wide political guidance at next week 's international conference in @entity70 to take forward the implementation of the @entity78 , " @entity17 said			0
the main question , the officials said , is whether @entity4 forces should attack @entity72 's military as part of the mission to protect civilians			1
the @entity87 contingent is arguing for the most limited interpretation of what is allowed under the @entity27 resolution			0
" the tricky question is when you have a situation where his forces are advancing on some positions rebels hold , do you hit ? " a senior @entity16 official asked			0
" if there are forces that are trying to get through rebel forces to kill people , there are some in the alliance like the @entity87 who said , ' we did n't sign up for that			0
' there are those like the @entity108 who are saying , ' of course we did			0
" the @entity16 official said the @entity113 administration 's interpretation is to do whatever is required to protect civilians			0
in the rush to quickly protect civilians from @entity72 's forces closing on @entity120 , the sources said that some countries and @entity123 secretary general @entity122 might have not fully understood what " any means necessary " meant			0
officials and diplomats said they are confident the rules of engagement can be worked out over the weekend before @entity4 takes command			1
" let 's just give it a day or two and see where things stand , " the senior defense official said			0
overall @entity4 command will be based in @entity135 , @entity136 , but @entity87 has agreed to allow a sub-command stationed at an airbase in @entity139 , @entity87			1
@entity4 is already supervising naval embargo operations from @entity135			2
the alliance said friday that @entity143 lt. gen. @entity142 , stationed in @entity135 , will take the lead for the @entity6 mission			1
the @entity87 air component will help give @entity4 the credibility it seeks in taking military action against a @entity150 nation			2
the tone of mission , however , already seems to have shifted , with @entity4 commanders attempting to enforce the @entity27 resolution to the letter of the law			2
" no - fly zones are impartial , there is no one authorized to fly within that zone , " said group captain @entity157 of @entity4 's @entity158			1
" it is not necessarily pro-gadhafi or @entity165 forces			0
it 's the impartial enforcement in line with the ( resolution )			0
" @entity2 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 is assuming command of the @entity6 mission
it is considering whether to go beyond enforcement of the no - fly zone
at issue is whether the alliance will assume the role of protecting civilians on the ground
