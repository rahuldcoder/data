-- @entity2 tennis player @entity1 has told @entity0 in an exclusive interview that he has been " treated like a criminal " following the year - long ban he received after missing a drugs test in april			1
the 27 - year - old was speaking less than 24 hours after compatriot and world no. 2 @entity9 branded anti-doping procedures in tennis as " ridiculous " following the treatment of his close friend			1
" i have been treated like a criminal " @entity1 said on wednesday , explaining how he was barred from attending @entity2 's @entity17 clash against @entity18 two months ago because of his troubles			1
" i was n't even allowed in the arena			0
they said it was not possible for me to attend -- even to be a spectator who bought a ticket and attended the match			0
" a lot of the players have been behind me , and gave me their support , so that means a lot to me in the toughest time of my career			1
" @entity1 , a former top - 20 player , was initially handed an 18 - month ban for missing a drugs test at the @entity36 , which was reduced to 12 months on tuesday after an appeal to the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
the @entity2 maintains he was given permission to miss the test due to illness and the fact he has a phobia of needles			1
" it 's very bad news that we got for him , and for me , for all of us who are close to him , " said @entity9 , who arrived at the press conference with written notes on the subject			1
" but i think it 's just not bad news for him , it proves again that this system does not work			0
" @entity9 used his post-match press conference following a three - set victory over @entity58 at the @entity59 to launch an attack on the sport 's various governing bodies as he vigorously defended @entity1			1
the six - time grand slam champion went on to claim that the consequences of not completing the test were not made plain to @entity1 at the time			1
" first of all , he 's not positive on any banned substance , " continued @entity9			1
" i 'm not saying that it 's completely not his fault			0
" she ( the @entity71 ) did not clearly present him with all the severe consequences that he will have if he avoids that			0
she told him that he needs to write a report and that he will be just fine			0
" and because of her negligence and because of her unprofessionalism , he is now off the tour for one year			0
and now it makes me nervous as a player to do any kind of test			2
" blog : nine reasons to watch the @entity59 in his interview with @entity86 , @entity1 confessed to being both surprised and moved by @entity9 's comments			1
" i did n't actually know he was going to say that - and the way he said it really meant the world to me , " he said from @entity88			0
" to have the support of a good friend of mine was just amazing at this moment , and i thank him so much			2
he 's really my true friend and i saw that in this moment			0
" not only him but other players too -- ( @entity101 ) @entity100 , ( @entity103 ) @entity102 and @entity104 ( @entity105 ) have also said nice things			2
" loss of @entity107 as a result of @entity1 's ban , which is a double blow because he will have to compete in lesser tournaments upon his return given his loss of ranking points , @entity9 said he has lost all faith in the ability of anti-doping authorities to conduct accurate and reliable tests			1
" i do n't have trust in them anymore , " said the 26 - year - old			2
" i do n't have trust in what 's going on			2
" i do n't know if tomorrow the ( anti-doping ) representative , because of the unprofessionalism , because of their negligence , because of their inability to explain the rules in a proper way , i do n't know if they 're going to misplace the test that i have or anything worse than that			1
" for me , the whole procedure of the court case is totally against the player and player 's rights			0
" now in @entity1 's case , he 's going to be sanctioned until july next year , and this lady , the @entity71 , she 's going to come back tomorrow for the job			2
nobody is going to answer for that			0
why ? " for me , this is total injustice			0
" he went on to criticize the @entity59 , the body which governs the elite men 's tour , for not offering greater support to @entity1 or @entity153 , who this year served a four - month ban -- reduced from nine months on appeal to @entity38 -- after testing positive for a banned substance which he claims to have taken unknowingly			1
" after this kind of announcement and after this particular situation , the only one who is suffering here is the player , " continued @entity9			2
" the @entity59 , which is supposed to be an association of players of tennis professionals , which is supposed to be the governing body , the association that stands behind the players , is not going to answer on this announcement , is not going to do anything for @entity1			1
" @entity1 is there by himself			2
tomorrow it can be anybody else			0
@entity153 was there in this situation			0
" i 'm emotionally connected to @entity1 but , looking at the whole scenario , it does n't give me any trust in that , in them , in the whole procedure , in the whole rules , in anything			1
sorry , but that 's what i had to do			0
not just because of him , but because of the sake of the players and because of the sake of the sport			0
" @entity1 's manager @entity194 was grateful that the @entity38 had reduced his client 's ban , but he was " very disappointed " that the sanction was still 12 months			2
" it 's another big setback , we were all expecting six months , but we will try to be as positive as we can , " @entity194 told @entity0			0
" we all believed that @entity1 was going to get back into the top 20 in the world and his coach @entity201 was doing a great job			2
now we have to rethink everything			0
" on the support @entity1 has received from @entity9 , @entity194 added : " @entity9 trusts @entity1			1
" policing tennis the @entity206 ( @entity206 ) accepted @entity38 ' decision to reduce @entity1 's ban , but reacted strongly to criticism of anti-doping officials			1
" the @entity206 , as the administrator of the @entity215 on behalf of the @entity217 tournaments , @entity59 and @entity213 , is committed with our partners to protect the integrity of the game of tennis , " read an @entity206 statement issued prior to @entity9 's outburst			1
" we respect the ruling of the @entity38 ... what is harder to accept is criticism of doping control officers who perform a difficult role			0
" finally , separate from this decision , we should all remember that exactly one year ago anti-doping programs around the world were under scrutiny			0
" this reinforced the need to be vigilant and apply the rules strictly , something that we and our partners in the tennis anti-doping program strive to do to keep our sport clean			1
