@entity11 told his evaluators that he had considered other ways to end his life , such as " putting my head in the toilet and doing a back flip " to break his neck , but opted against doing so out of fear that he might only paralyze or otherwise injure himself , according to the evaluation carried out by @entity28			2
@entity11 told the evaluation team in march that " he wanted to essentially encourage the jury to vote in favor of the death penalty ... perhaps by taking the stand and looking like he has no remorse , " @entity28 said			1
