-- when people ask me if there 's anything i miss about my old job at @entity7 , it 's an easy answer			1
besides the amazingly talented colleagues i worked with there , i miss picking the cover			2
the cover is the calling card of any magazine , but it was particularly true for newsmagazines , since we put out a new issue every week and the range of subjects we had to choose from was so broad			1
in my era , as competition from more instant news on cable tv and the @entity23 became ever more intense , it was also the one area where our slowpoke frequency could work in our favor			2
make a smart call on the cover , and it stayed on newsstands and coffee tables for an entire week for readers to admire and discuss			2
it 's why , for instance , i still hear people talk about the cover story that i asked @entity36 , my former colleague at @entity7 ( and now at @entity0 ) , to write after 9/11 called " why they hate us			1
" of course , the opposite was also true			0
make a dumb call and you had to live with it for a whole week			0
a crudely photoshopped cover of @entity44 emerging from behind a curtain after her brief prison stint for obstruction of justice and making false statements to investigators comes to mind			2
for decades , the cover was also how the fierce competition between @entity7 and @entity54 was defined			1
in the 1960s , @entity7 became a " hot book " after three decades as a distant also - ran , thanks largely to its forward - looking covers on civil rights , @entity59 and the women 's movement ( not to mention @entity61 and @entity62 )			1
in the 1970s , it was the cleverness of its cover designs as well as the depth of its reporting that wowed everyone who followed @entity7 's coverage of @entity70			1
when both magazines put a young @entity72 on the cover in the same week in 1975 , it became conventional wisdom that we tried to copy each other			1
but the opposite was true : we were always looking to win the cover war , and we exulted when we did			2
one of those moments came for me the weekend that princess @entity81 died in 1997			1
we held the presses , threw out the issue we had just put to bed and came back into the office in the wee hours to publish a new one			2
i wanted a striking image for the cover and remembered a black and white photo of a short - haired @entity81 that had been taken by the fashion photographer @entity91			1
one of my photo editors , a friend of @entity91 's , went to his apartment , woke him up and persuaded him to give us the negative			2
when i saw a wire service photo several hours later of @entity98 's cover , a standard news shot of @entity81 , i knew our issue would crush theirs on the newsstand			1
and it did , selling well over a million copies			0
some weeks , like that one , the thrill was in " crashing " a cover at the last minute when a big story broke close to our sunday deadline			0
@entity108 would perish in a plane accident , or @entity110 would get captured in @entity111 , and we 'd switch covers and have the satisfaction of looking nimble and newsy on monday			0
details , however , could sometimes get overlooked in the rush			0
in 1990 , when i wrote a sunday story on @entity118 's release from prison , we put the word " @entity121 ! " on the cover			1
we never stopped to think that people would assume we were giving away the magazine for nothing			0
on slower news weeks , the satisfaction was in posing a pressing or provocative question about the economy , or race relations , or gay rights , or the fight to improve our health or save our schools			0
or it was in deciding which icons deserved covers when they died , and what new cultural figures were worth highlighting on the way up			0
as proud as i was of putting a newly elected senator from @entity141 named @entity142 on our year - end cover in 2004 , i was just as proud of selecting @entity144 in 2003			0
then there was the sheer creative fun of coming up with the designs and words for the cover			0
i 'll never forget election night 2000 , when the race between @entity152 and @entity153 went into overtime			1
we were closing a special issue , and we had prepared separate covers declaring each man the winner			0
but what to do now ? at about 3 in the morning , my art director walked into my office with an image that her staff had concocted of the two faces melded into one			0
" that 's genius ! " i said , and we put it on the cover with the headline " @entity169 ... " decades from now , when people have forgotten most of what they read inside the pages of @entity7 , they 'll still remember the visual impact of covers like that one			1
and those of us who were lucky enough to work there will remember those late nights , crowded in the editor 's office , competing to see who could come up with the best cover line			1
it sure was heaven while it lasted .			0

the cover is the calling card of any magazine , @entity186 says
the cover was also how the competition between @entity7 and @entity54 was defined
@entity186 recalls the striking cover put together the weekend princess @entity81 died
another favorite : for the 2000 election results , a *composite* of @entity152 's and @entity153 's faces
