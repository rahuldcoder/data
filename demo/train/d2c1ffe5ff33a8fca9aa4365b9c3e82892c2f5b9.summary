-- the business of saving lives can happen in the most unassuming of places : in the corner of a nondescript , dingy building in an unnamed @entity8 city , in a small office that can barely fit four desks			0
here , trained counselors take the calls of young people in crisis and those who worry about them			1
it 's the kind of place where the mere act of talking can eclipse the tragic , where people work to keep headlines -- like the story of @entity23 student @entity21 -- from ever happening			1
welcome to one of the two national call centers for the @entity26 , @entity30 's only 24/7 crisis and suicide prevention hot line for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and questioning youths			1
the lifeline is a cornerstone of the @entity41 , a broader nonprofit dedicated to promoting acceptance of @entity37 youths and to preventing suicides			1
between this center and another on the @entity44 -- at least one is open at all times -- about 30,000 calls are fielded each year			1
they come from young people struggling with who they are and those who feel desperately alone			0
they are from kids who 've been kicked out of their homes and those whose friends have rejected them			0
they are from students being tormented by text messages and , at times , those who are poised with a bottle of pills or a gun			0
anti-bullying resources for parents and teachers and they are from mothers like @entity63 , who dialed the lifeline when her love for her son just was n't enough			1
@entity67 , 16 , was only 12 when he came out			1
he says he was too young to even imagine that parents might turn their backs on a child			0
fortunately , his did n't			1
even with his family 's acceptance , he kept to himself the stories about bullying			2
a couple of times , though , he could n't hide the depths of his pain			2
he 'd broken down and talked about ending his life , but in those cases , he could be soothed , and that seemed enough			0
opinion : being bullied is hell , but life gets better one time , though , was different			0
the family was on a ski trip during @entity67 's freshman year in high school			1
he 'd confessed by text his feelings for a close friend and had told the boy he liked him			2
the return call that he got , the one in which that boy told @entity67 he could not be trusted and they could not be friends anymore , made him crumble			1
@entity63 did n't know what had happened , but she saw him race to his bedroom , and she followed			2
" he was basically on the bed in the fetal position just crying and saying how much he hated life , did n't want to live , did n't want to go back to school , " she says , remembering that evening two and a half years ago and peering at her son beside her			1
" he was just crying so hard ... and i could only comfort him so much			0
and that 's when i remembered that a friend had given me the number for the @entity41			1
" she 'd stored that number in her phone , just in case she ever needed it			1
" at that point i was out of resources , " she says			0
" i was in a panic			0
i was frantic ... i could n't just keep saying ' i love you , i support you ' and move on			2
" the @entity41 does n't publicize where the two call centers are to protect their 160 volunteer counselors , all of whom receive at least 40 to 50 hours of training before they take on shifts			1
nor does it allow for outsiders to listen in on calls			2
but even a short glimpse into the @entity8 call center helps one imagine what happened next			0
wearing a headset , prepared with questions to assess risk , a counselor answered			2
" a calming voice was on the other end , " @entity63 remembers			0
" i talked to the gentleman on the phone , and he asked to speak to @entity67			1
" her son spoke to the counselor for close to an hour			2
all the while , she was by his side , her arms wrapped around him , doing all she could			0
" when i first heard the voice , i was just very relieved , " @entity67 says , before adding what he remembers being told			1
" ' calm down , @entity67			1
everything 's going to be ok			2
please do n't do anything			2
ca n't we just talk for a little more ? ' and i think that really helped me ... it really calmed me down			1
" in a corner of the small call center office sits a short bookshelf crammed with titles including " out in all directions : almanac of @entity157 , " " @entity158 : my son 's murder in @entity161 , and a @entity162 " and " free to be ... @entity163			2
" posted on bulletin boards are talking points , lists of resources , contact numbers to use in case of emergency			0
the lifeline has a psychiatrist on call at all times			0
after @entity67 finished speaking to the counselor , who encouraged him to call anytime , he handed the phone back to @entity63			1
the counselor then gave her resources , names and numbers , she says , and " he kind of gave me the strength and path to go down to get the help we needed			0
" he also gave her the reassurance that her son was not in the imminent danger she feared			0
" we were still able to reach him and get through to him and talk to him , " she says			0
" i knew he needed help , but i did n't know how to give it to him			0
and that 's where the @entity41 was able to help me			1
" @entity194 's coming out triggers bullying in the time since that call , @entity67 says he 's become more able to reach out to others			1
he wo n't hesitate to speak with the counselors at school , and he 's found friends he trusts			1
this does n't mean , though , that the comments he hears in school or the looks he catches do n't affect him anymore			0
" they still sting the same way , " he says			0
" but i developed a support system			0
" and in those tough moments when those around him are n't available , or if he needs a different ear , he knows where to turn			0
programmed in his phone is a number he can always call			1
to reach the @entity26 , call 866 - 4 - @entity214 .			0

a friend 's rejection made @entity67 crumble and left him saying he did n't want to live
his mother remembered she had a number for the @entity41 in her phone and dialed for help
a counselor " really calmed me down , " says @entity67 , who holds onto the number years later
the @entity41 takes the calls of @entity37 youth in crisis and those who care about them
