-- it was a remarkably short interview by cable news standards			1
the moment that veteran military reporter @entity7 , in an appearance on @entity6 , begin to unload on @entity6 , he found his segment abruptly ended			1
thank you , very much			0
@entity10 of you to drop by			0
some of those who love to dish it out , it seems , are n't very big on taking it			0
the self - protective shield that some media organizations erect around their companies is hardly limited to @entity21 's network			2
but what happened with @entity7 this week is a case study in sidelining a guest who dared challenge the premise of a story			1
to be sure , anchor @entity28 was polite and did n't interrupt @entity7 , but he could n't have hustled him off the set faster if he had used a vaudeville - style hook			1
watch : should @entity6 have pulled plug on @entity7 for ripping the network ? @entity7 , a longtime reporter for the @entity33 and @entity34 , has been making the rounds to talk about his latest book , " the @entity37			1
" ( he appeared on " @entity38 " on sunday , and i welcomed his criticism of the media			0
) @entity42 , not surprisingly , wanted to focus on an issue that it frames as a scandal : the @entity48 administration 's handling of the fatal attack on @entity51 diplomats in @entity52			0
watch : twitter on fire as @entity55 slimes a female critic @entity6 's angle was clear from @entity28 's setup : " right now , pressure mounting on the @entity48 administration over its response to the deadly attack on our consulate in @entity65			1
" but @entity7 did n't pull his punches based on the venue			1
" i think @entity65 was generally hyped by this network especially , " he said			0
@entity28 pushed back , which he had every right to do : " when you have four people dead , including the first @entity51 ambassador in more than 30 years , how do you call that hype ? " that 's when @entity7 , after explaining the difficulty of determining what happened in a firefight , went for the jugular : " i think that the emphasis on @entity65 has been extremely political , partly because @entity6 was operating as a wing of the @entity82			1
" the interview was over , less than 90 seconds after it started			2
was @entity7 being deliberately provocative ? perhaps he was , for controversy sells books			1
and maybe his criticism was overstated			0
but the fact remains that he was invited as a guest , was asked about the @entity52 attack and responded in a way that made @entity6 's relentless coverage of the controversy part of the story			1
and that was deemed unacceptable			0
watch : is it time for @entity97 , gay rights activist , to leave @entity98 ? @entity99 , @entity6 's executive vice president , told me that @entity7 's conduct " felt like a stunt ... that was just bush league , especially for a veteran reporter			1
" @entity7 was n't answering the anchor 's question , says @entity99 , and @entity28 , feeling " offended , " decided that " i 'm not going to give this guy any more airtime			1
" what 's more , @entity99 says , @entity7 " apologized " to a @entity6 staffer on the way out			1
@entity7 denies this , saying he told the staffer , who accused him of being rude , that he " might have been a bit snappish " because he was tired from his book tour			1
" this was in no way an apology , " @entity7 told me , " but rather an explanation of why i jumped a bit when the anchor began the segment with the assertion that pressure on the @entity125 was building , which it most clearly was not			1
" as for the interview itself , " i was not picking a fight with @entity6			1
i was answering their questions			0
" watch : why @entity133 is getting a bum rap on @entity135 had @entity28 wanted to argue that his network was right to pound away at the administration 's shifting stories on @entity52 , and that it was the rest of the media that was underplaying the matter , they could have had a substantive discussion			0
instead , it was over before it began			0
" you have a point , " @entity99 said			0
" it could have been a back - and - forth debate			1
but that 's just not @entity28 's style			0
@entity28 is a more traditional anchor - reporter			2
" the episode reminded me of an uncomfortable clash in 2010 when @entity6 anchor @entity153 repeatedly berated @entity154 , a liberal contributor to the network , for challenging her constant harping on a minor scandal involving the @entity158			1
@entity153 repeatedly interrupted her guest , told @entity160 she did n't know what she was talking about and at one point threatened to cut her mike			2
the difference is that @entity153 later realized she had gone too far and told me she had apologized to @entity160			0
the anchor , of course , holds the power in such situations			0
in may , @entity170 's @entity169 was interviewing @entity171 , a conservative columnist for the @entity172			0
she asked about @entity174 's testy reaction to a reporter 's question , the day after a report that the candidate had bullied another student in high school , when @entity171 tried to turn the tables			2
" what you 're doing here is a typical media trick , " he said			0
" you hype up a story and justify the second - day coverage of the story			2
" @entity169 began lecturing @entity171 , saying " you do n't have to answer a single question and you did n't have to accept the invitation to come on ... you 're kind of in my house here , " as if he were an unruly dinner guest			2
as @entity171 tried to get a word in , @entity169 kept talking over him : " you 're irritating me right now ... you 're not gon na come on and insult me , you 're not gon na come on and insult the network when you knew what we were gon na talk about			0
the anchor went to another guest and @entity171 had been summarily dismissed for challenging @entity170 's handling of the story			0
watch : media buzzing as @entity204 says he may run again what 's at issue here is not that on - air personalities sometimes let their tempers flare ; anyone spending many hours on the air ( including me ) may get a little peevish now and then			2
it 's an attitude that one 's own organization is so above reproach that a guest 's criticism amounts to insulting behavior			0
and since anchors pride themselves on their aggressive questioning , they look small and defensive when they shut down the guest			2
not everyone fits this description , of course			0
in fact , @entity6 's @entity228 seems to relish the chance to repeat the swipes of anyone who takes him on , punch back and invite the offender on for a debate ( which many decline )			1
cable news can be a rough arena			2
but honest debate , even with puglistic guests , ought to be a two - way street			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

a @entity6 interview with *author* @entity7 was cut short
@entity7 said " @entity6 was operating as a wing of the @entity82 "
@entity244 : @entity6 acted too self - protectively rather than allow a debate on its role
@entity244 says other cable anchors have shut down guests who question their networks
