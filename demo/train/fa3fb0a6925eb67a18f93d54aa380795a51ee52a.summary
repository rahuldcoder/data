-- do n't let the " former teen star " description fool you : @entity4 is one young celeb who truly has it together			1
you wo n't find the @entity7 star landing in the tabloids because of hard - partying ways			2
instead , the 23 - year - old actress / singer has made headlines by getting married ( to pro hockey player @entity13 ) and adding to her ridiculously impressive resume : in october , the actress / singer released her first book , a young - adult novel called " @entity18			1
" here , @entity4 chats with @entity19 about what she loves about writing , which workout she swears by , and her hard - earned secret to body confidence			1
q : what 's your definition of living healthy ? a : moderation is key			1
eating healthily all the time can be boring -- you know , when you take apart the menu and ask for everything on the side ? balance makes me feel good : i feel most healthy when i enjoy small bites of the things i love			1
i used to feel bad about eating @entity40 fries -- i 'd think that i had blown my diet			1
but you have to think , that 's ok , i 'll eat healthier tomorrow			1
@entity0 : 25 diet - busting foods you should never eat q : what are your favorite good - for - you snacks ? a : recently , i have been eating a lot of vegetables and hummus and fruit -- stuff i never really liked before			1
if i am hungry before bed , i will grab a handful of blueberries			2
@entity57 yogurt is one of my favorite things in the whole world			1
sometimes i 'll chop up a bunch of veggies and put them in a food processor with @entity57 yogurt and make a dip			2
it 's better if @entity68 snack throughout the day , because if i get hungry , @entity13 says i get " hangry , " which is hungry - angry			1
q : do you have any guilty - pleasure foods ? a : i love cheese			2
i would probably eat any kind you put in front of me ! and i like healthy things with a high fat content , like dark chocolate and avocado			1
@entity0 : how to make chocolate a healthy indulgence q : you 're into @entity84 , right ? a : i was a gymnast when i was little , so i think @entity84 is really important to helping me stay long and lean			2
i try to do it three times a week			2
i also do circuit training			2
before i was n't doing much cardio -- just @entity84 -- and i was n't getting the same results , so i bumped up my cardio and do circuits probably twice a week			2
q : you intensified your workouts ( with trainer @entity96 ) before your august wedding			2
have you kept that up ? a : i was kind of burned out afterward , so i relaxed a bit , but now i am starting to feel the effects			1
i probably wo n't be as hard on myself , but i do want to stay on top of it			2
it 's a constant battle			1
q : what are your tricks for making workouts fun ? a : making sure i work out with people i can talk to			2
sometimes my sister [ @entity111 ] and i will work out together , and we laugh the whole time , so it goes by faster			0
i can also read a script or book while on the elliptical			0
i joke with @entity13 that i have better than 20 - 20 vision			0
@entity0 : get the body you crave with celeb - inspired workouts q : do you have any health regrets ? a : i got pretty skinny when i was between 17 and 19			1
i do n't know what exactly made me get on that kick , but at the time i was starting to become aware of what people said about me and how i looked in pictures			0
i literally ate nothing but steamed vegetables and broiled or grilled chicken , with nothing else			1
i was touring at the time , traveling everywhere , and i felt so run down			0
not giving your body enough of what it needs is really dangerous			1
i regret it because i do n't think i was happy then			0
q : you endured scrutiny about your weight when you were still a teenager			0
how did you handle that ? a : it sucked			0
i was 16 and my body was still changing and people would say i was too heavy			1
and then i would lose weight and my face would get skinny and people would say i had done something to my face and that i was too skinny			0
it must have been really hard because i 've blocked it out a little			0
at the time , i felt almost proud of being skinny , but one day the mother of a fan came up to me and said , " are you ok ? are they not feeding you ? " after that , all of a sudden , i stopped being as concerned about everything			0
it was n't a big intervention or anything			0
i got off tour and changed			0
i started hanging out with my friends and cooking and had a more normal life			0
@entity0 : how do you find your feel great weight ? q : you seem comfortable in your own skin now			1
what 's the key to body confidence ? a : i have issues and insecurities just like everybody else			1
it really helps to have a partner that loves everything about you and makes you feel really beautiful			1
not that you should look for other people to make you feel good about yourself , but it does help			1
other than that , i really do feel like working out has helped because you 're working hard for something			1
you feel stronger and a little more powerful			1
there 's no trick , though			2
nobody is ever perfect , but it helps to look for things to feel good about , rather than things to feel bad about			1
q : your first novel , " @entity18 , " came out in october			0
what made you want to write a young - adult book ? a : it was a few years ago , and i asked myself , " what do i want to do ? how can i spend time with @entity13 ? " i wanted to be able to reach out to my fans , and writing was something creative i could do , even when i was traveling with him			0
@entity0 : 10 ways to make any hotel room healthier q : after releasing four albums , you put your music career on hold			0
think you 'll return to the studio ? a : i want to act			0
that is what i want to focus on more , but it 's all about timing and finding the right role			2
q : did any of the older @entity218 alums give you advice when you were starting out ? a : i think people imagine it that way , that you have these deep conversations about how to manage your way through this craziness			0
i 've met @entity227 [ @entity228 ] and @entity229 [ @entity230 ] a few times , but it 's not like they 've said , " here , sit down , listen to me kid			2
" q : you filmed a threesome scene on " @entity237 " last season			0
what was that like ? a : i went into my wardrobe fitting one day and was trying on lingerie			0
i asked them why i was trying on so much lingerie , and they were like , " oh , you do n't know ? you 're having a threesome scene			0
" my first thought was , " how am i going to tell my mother ? " @entity0 : the secret to hotter sex q : how have things changed between you and @entity13 since getting married ? a : i think we already felt married before we were married because we had a really strong commitment to each other			1
i did feel different after the wedding , going through the steps and saying those words to one another , but now things have settled down and gone back to normal			1
q : do you have special plans for your first @entity265 as newlyweds ? a : for the last few years [ @entity13 ] has been in @entity267 and they do @entity265 on a different day			0
i do n't know if my mom is going to come or where we 'll be			0
@entity0 : secrets to a fresh , fast @entity265 but i love to bake ! on @entity265 , i make pecan pie and pumpkin pie			0
before the wedding i was baking all the time and giving it away and my friends were like , " we know what you are doing -- you are making us eat it [ so you do n't eat it ]			0
this is mean ! " @entity19 2011			0
