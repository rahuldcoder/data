@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 journalist expelled from @entity1 was denied entry when he came back to the country because " he violated a number of rules concerning the work of foreign correspondents , " the @entity3 said on its website tuesday			1
@entity14 , the @entity0 reporter for the @entity16 newspaper , was detained by @entity1 authorities , locked in a cell for 45 minutes , and then put on a plane back to @entity20 , according to an article in the @entity16 tuesday			1
he had been returning to @entity0 after spending two months in @entity20 reporting on the @entity23 diplomatic cables published by the website @entity24			0
the @entity26 said the incident occurred on saturday			0
@entity28 , the @entity16 's editor , said in a statement that @entity1 's move was " a very troubling development with serious implications for press freedom			2
" but the @entity3 statement said the rules allegedly violated were set down in 1994 and are " well known " to all working journalists in the country			2
" in particular , having applied for and received the extension of his accreditation at the end of november last year , @entity14 left @entity0 for @entity20 for his own business without receiving a ( new ) foreign correspondent press card issued in his name , although he knew he should have done that			1
" therefore , if @entity45 is still interested in working in @entity1 during the validity term of his @entity1 visa , he needs to settle the issues related to his accreditation with the @entity51 and @entity52			2
" if @entity45 complies with these rules , which are the same for all foreign correspondents , there will be no problems with his entry to the @entity1 , " the statement said			1
in a statement to @entity60 , @entity5 's minister for europe @entity61 made reference to the accreditation issue but not specifically the foreign correspondent press card			0
" indeed , last november the @entity16 approached us for support to secure mr. @entity14 's reaccreditation as a journalist when his accreditation had been withdrawn			2
we made representations at a senior level and in the event , mr. @entity14 was granted an extension of his accreditation as a journalist			0
" @entity61 said @entity14 had not been " given any explanation for his exclusion " and deplored any restrictions on free media and freedom of expression			0
" we understand that mr. @entity14 had previously been warned by the @entity1 authorities about several alleged violations of his status as a journalist -- including visits without permission to border zones and classified areas , " he said			1
@entity61 said @entity14 " knows @entity1 well and has , over the last four years , given readers of the @entity16 genuine insight into that country			1
" assigned to @entity0 since 2007 , @entity14 covered many events , including the 2008 war between @entity1 and @entity95 and the twin suicide attacks on the @entity0 metro system in 2010			1
he also wrote a number of controversial articles , including one on the speculation surrounding the alleged secret wealth of @entity1 's powerful prime minister , @entity102			0
last year , @entity14 was reprimanded by @entity1 authorities for unauthorized travel to areas closed to journalists			1
" it is worrying that the @entity1 government should now kick out reporters of whom they disapprove			0
@entity1 's treatment of journalists -- both domestic and foreign -- is a cause of great concern , " @entity28 said			0
@entity2 's @entity114 contributed to this report			0
