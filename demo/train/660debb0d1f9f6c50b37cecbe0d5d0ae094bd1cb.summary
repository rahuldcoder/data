@entity1 , @entity0 -- one million free text messages will be sent every day for 12 months from monday in @entity4 in a bid to raise @entity7 awareness and encourage testing for the disease			1
former @entity4 president @entity10 launched a similar cell phone initiative in 2003			1
the ambitious @entity13 is being rolled out across the country after a pilot period that saw calls to a @entity18 national helpline shoot up by 200 percent , organizers say			1
the @entity19 estimates that there are currently six million people living with @entity7 in @entity4 and just one in 10 get the treatment they need			2
" @entity4 is the epicenter of the global @entity7 epidemic , " said @entity7 activist @entity24 in @entity25 at an annual conference for the social innovation network pop ! @entity30 , an organization instrumental in developing the concept			0
' @entity13 , ' or ' @entity32 ' was set up to try to encourage people to seek testing and treatment in a country where cell phones are abundant			1
@entity4 is cited as the fastest growing mobile - phone network in the world			0
in @entity4 , more than 80 percent of the population has one -- the country has a population of 49 million , and it is estimated that 43 million have cell phones			2
almost 95 percent of the phones are prepaid			0
the initiative plans to broadcast millions of health messages every month to phones across @entity4			1
" this is the largest ever use of cell phones for health information , " said @entity49 , one of the project 's originators			1
" there is near universal coverage , " said @entity49 during the launch of the project			2
" and in the absence of other services , the mobile phone has become the central component for people to get access to information			0
" organizers say ' @entity32 ' will offer @entity4 the privacy to get tested and pursue treatment options and counseling by staff who are @entity7 positive themselves			0
the system sends the messages using a so - called " @entity77 " ( @entity76 ) service			2
this free form of text messaging , common across @entity4 , allows someone without any phone credit to send a text to a friend asking them to call			1
each sent @entity76 message has the words " please call me , " the phone number of the caller , and space for an additional 120 characters			0
the extra space is normally filled with advertising , which helps offset the cost of running the service			0
the message reads : " frequently sick , tired , losing weight and scared that you might be @entity7 positive ? please call @entity98			0
" encouraging people to get tested is a huge challenge in a country where people with the @entity18 virus still face stigma and shame			1
however , ' @entity32 ' appears to be having an impact , since it was initiated in october			0
" we have observed a dramatic increase in the call rate to the @entity98 -- from approximately 1,300 calls per day to a new average of 3,600 , " said @entity107 , @entity108 , one of the partners			2
trained operators provide callers with accurate healthcare information , and referrals to local testing clinics many of the messages are broadcast in @entity0 and in local languages such as @entity122			0
as well as pop ! @entity30 , the project has been developed and funded by @entity7 charities and technology and design firms , including @entity128 , @entity129 , the @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
pop ! @entity30 's director of communications @entity133 told @entity2 there are plans to expand the project to other affected countries after its official launch in february 2009			1
he said : " one of the objectives of the february launch event will be to secure additional funding , so we can continue to expand @entity13 into its planned 2nd and 3rd phases beyond @entity4			1
