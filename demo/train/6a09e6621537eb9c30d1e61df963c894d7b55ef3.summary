-- " the moment i got into the modeling industry , i knew i had to be an entrepreneur , " says former supermodel @entity5			1
one of the most recognized models of the 1970s and ' 80s , @entity5 has used her entrepreneurial skills to great effect in the fashion industry , with her own cosmetics business and in her charitable fund - raising work			1
married to rock star @entity12 and now residing in @entity13 , @entity5 was born in @entity14 in 1955			1
her father was an ambassador , but her comfortable upbringing was disrupted in 1969 with the assassination of @entity14 's president , forcing her and her family to flee to @entity20			1
" we left @entity14 with nothing but the clothes on our back			2
not even photographs , nothing			2
so it 's a total loss of everything and a total loss of your own self , your own country , your own place in terms of your people			2
if you 're lucky you 're in a country that will give you a second chance , " she told @entity0			0
she was lucky and her adopted home of @entity20 provided her with a scholarship at @entity40 , and it was also in the @entity20 capital that she was discovered as a model			1
stopped on a @entity44 street by fashion photographer @entity45 , she was soon signed by a top model agency and moved to @entity13 in 1975			1
with her exotic looks she caused a stir in the fashion world , helped in part by a fanciful story about her background spread by @entity45			1
" they wanted to believe because it 's kind of like ' @entity54 '			0
everything about that article was fabricated ... i was discovered herding goats and discovered in the jungle ; i 've never seen the jungle in my life			1
i was a city girl , " she said			0
@entity5 admits she was complicit in the fabrication , suggesting an early realization that the fashion industry was built around control and manipulation			1
" i had to be very clever about not over exposing myself , not under exposing myself			0
i had to make sure that i knew my worth that i would not settle if they gave me less			2
i knew how to walk away			2
" after facing numerous challenges being a black model , she launched @entity72 in 1994 , designed for models no matter the color of their skin			0
a hugely successful catwalk career as a model ended in 1989 , but she faced up to the transitory nature of her career and gained a greater sense of self long before that when she was injured in a car accident in 1983			0
" where everything was about what you do and about how you look , it changed to more security about me			0
it was not about ' how will i look ten years from now ? ' it all became about what kind of person would i be ten years from now			0
" because of it i became very comfortable in my own skin			0
in a weird way i did n't think about outward looks anymore , " she said .			0
