-- as many as 200,000 people -- most of them mainland @entity2 - based @entity1 - are expected to return to @entity1 this weekend for an election viewed as critical to the future of an economy that has boomed thanks to warmer ties with @entity9			1
@entity1 does not allow absentee voting and the growing political clout of @entity1 's expatriate businessmen -- known as @entity13 in @entity14 -- will be a determining factor in elections that will set the tenor of the relationship with @entity9			1
" because of the closeness of the race , this election has the highest ever number of returnees , " says professor @entity19 of @entity20 , adding that estimates could be as high as 250,000 returnees			0
" corporate bosses have mobilized their employees to participate in these elections like never before			2
" @entity31 is chartering six planes to get people back to vote and @entity34 is another company that is helping employees return for the election			1
" with memories of the 2008 election still fresh , when incumbent @entity39 of the @entity40 was returned with just 30,000 of the 13 million votes cast , the @entity13 are concerned that a change of government could stall the lucrative rapprochement with @entity9			2
@entity39 's chief opponent is @entity46 of the pro-independence @entity47			0
@entity46 has the chance to become the @entity1 's first female president , but her campaign to paint @entity39 's pro-beijing policies as selling out @entity1 's sovereignty may cost her @entity13 votes , analysts say			2
" @entity1 is a democracy and , of course , the way that they vote remains to be seen , " says @entity19			2
" but the pro-business and @entity61 campaign is something of a double - edged sword			0
the opposition @entity64 has been able to paint the president as someone whose policies have only benefited the big corporations			0
" although @entity1 is called the " @entity1 , " and @entity1 has been de facto independent from the @entity14 since 1949 when the @entity40 or @entity72 government lost the @entity14 civil war and withdrew to @entity1 , @entity9 considers the island a mere breakaway province			1
@entity2 has never ruled out the use of force against @entity1 to achieve reunification			1
if @entity2 uses military force against the island the @entity79 could intervene under the @entity82 , raising fears of a much wider conflict			0
relations between @entity1 and @entity9 softened in 2008 when the two governments opened trade , transport and postal services , allowing direct links for the first time			1
what had once been a daylong ordeal , where flights to @entity9 had to be routed through @entity95 , has become a short hop across the @entity97			0
@entity98 has strongly benefited , with 30 % of the 6 million foreign visitors arriving in @entity1 coming from mainland @entity2			1
exports , meanwhile , are enjoying a bonanza , hitting a record us $ 115 billion , up 35 % from a year earlier			0
" economically , it 's been a big boost for @entity1 , " says @entity19			0
for its part , mainland @entity2 , also drawn by the economic prospects of closer ties , has been content not to disturb the status quo , in marked contrast to earlier elections			1
in 1996 , it reacted angrily to the first direct presidential elections in @entity1 believing that the favorite to win that poll , @entity114 , was advocating a separate identity and formal statehood for what @entity9 has always dubbed a ' renegade province			1
' prior to those elections , @entity9 conducted missile tests in the @entity97 aimed at intimidating voters and the @entity79 moved two aircraft carriers into the region			2
@entity9 's posturing created the opposite effect and @entity114 won the poll handsomely			0
since then , @entity9 has taken a hands - off approach , not wanting to upset what is settling into a strong economic relationship			0
" the @entity1 government has stated that the election is their domestic affair and , so far , there has been nothing overt in terms of opposition from @entity9 's side , " says @entity19			1
@entity138 to the current policy between @entity9 and @entity140 has been widespread support for the @entity142 which enshrined the " @entity2 principle			1
" under this agreement , both sides recognize there is only one @entity2 -- that both the mainland and @entity1 constitute @entity2 -- but it is up to each side to express their own definition of this			2
" traditionally business leaders have shied away from commenting on political issues , " says @entity19 , adding that this election has been different in that @entity13 have been more overtly partisan than in previous elections			0
" but there 's a recognition that there 's a need to continue with the @entity142 and that it 's the best choice for @entity13 in terms of the prosperity of @entity1 , " he said .			0

@entity1 heads to the polls on *saturday* to vote in presidential elections
since ties with @entity9 have warmed , thousands of @entity1 businesses are based in @entity2
returning ' @entity169 ' could *decide* one of the closest polls on record
*tycoons* have been chartering planes to fly employees back to vote in the election
