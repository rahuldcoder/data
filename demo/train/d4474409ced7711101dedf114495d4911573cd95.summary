@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 @entity3 stand under the blazing sun at @entity6 airfield waiting for their ride to take them far beyond the perimeter fence			1
wearing body armor and weapons , they dump their helmets and bags in the dirt and look out onto one of @entity1 's busiest runways			1
a $ 25 million harrier jet flies past , leaving the roar of its engine in its wake , while a @entity20 touches down to pick up troops and cargo			1
an @entity24 aircraft -- half helicopter , half plane -- hovers in the distance before landing to join the dozen other @entity28 sitting on the tarmac			1

the helicopter invented by a @entity35 - @entity4 is older than the other military hardware on the runway but it 's reliable and gets the job done			1
as it approaches the apron of the runway , the draft blows the dirt straight into the faces of the @entity3			2
they do n't turn their backs to the assault of sand , dirt and gravel but hold their ground and stare right into it -- a display of @entity3 toughness that could come in handy in the mission ahead			2
they 're headed to @entity58 province , where the insurgency is growing stronger by the day			2
opinion : @entity61 - on - blue attacks show there 's no easy way out as i stand there wondering if all these @entity3 will return from their tour in the badlands of southwest @entity1 , a lanky 19 - year - old soldier with a buzz cut strolls by and strikes up a conversation			1
he tells me he was in the third grade in @entity74 when the september 11 attacks occurred			1
" i grew up watching the war in @entity1 on @entity2 , and i knew i wanted to come here and fight for my country , " he says			2
we 've come to the front line of this war to see the transfer of power that is under way between @entity4 and @entity1 forces			1
but a spate of so - called " green on blue " attacks -- @entity1 soldiers or police attacking @entity4 and other international forces -- has caused serious alarm for @entity4 and @entity91 troops , and the transition process has been fast tracked			1
read more : @entity4 restricts @entity1 ops after ' green - on - blue ' killings the @entity3 have sent us to @entity0 , at the crossroads of @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity100 provinces , to show how joint patrols are still happening , despite @entity103 's orders to suspend many of the operations			1
as we touch down in this dusty , desolate landscape , it quickly becomes apparent the @entity3 are no longer training the @entity1			2
they 've handed over the reins of this outpost to the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) and the 28 @entity3 who remain here are working in an " advisory " role , marking off the days on the calendar until they are scheduled to go home for @entity115			1
while everyone lives inside the massive compound , the two camps are divided by high barbed - wire fences , with several hundred meters of land between them			1
the @entity3 and @entity1 live , eat and sleep separately			2
they only come together and mix on common ground where the central command headquarters is located			2
a @entity3 introduces me to the man in charge -- gen. @entity127 from the @entity109			1
the former @entity129 fighter is leading 5,000 @entity1 soldiers from the @entity132 border east to @entity133 -- some of the most dangerous territory in the country			2
he 's just returned from a 10 - day trip visiting many of his outposts , driving hundreds of kilometers along @entity140			1
it 's a journey the @entity4 would n't even consider doing by road because of all the improvised explosive devices , or @entity144 , planted daily by insurgents			2
when i ask the general about the dangers he faces , he just laughs and tells me : " this is @entity1			2
my men sweep the roads for landmines every morning , so they 're fine to travel on during the day			2
it 's when we sleep that the @entity156 puts them out again			0
" while standing in @entity160 's office , a soldier informs him of a report of a suspected ied outside the local police headquarters			0
he takes us in his humvee to the site about three kilometers ( two miles ) beyond the wire from @entity167			0
the @entity4 are not accompanying us			0
they have no desire to leave the fortified compound , as they explain this is now an @entity1 operation			0
lt. @entity171 , who has been with the @entity109 for the past two years , is leading the mission			1
he and another solider are carrying a metal detector , a block of @entity176 explosive , detonators and a drag rope			0
the site is off the main highway on a dirt road leading to a village			0
we walk in single file , aware of every single step , in case there are other mines that have been laid under the surface			0
the soldier sweeping the road suddenly stops when his equipment starts beeping -- a sign it 's picked up something possibly very dangerous			0
we all crouch down and he gently picks at the earth			0
after a painstaking search he declares there 's nothing there and we move on			0
soldiers armed with @entity203 machine guns stand above us on the dusty hill watching in case there 's an ambush			0
a local villager on a motorcycle attempts to drive in our direction			0
the soldiers point their weapons and yell out a warning , telling the driver to head off in another direction			0
suicide bombings are also a common tactic for the @entity156 , and these soldiers are only too aware of the dangers that now face them			0
we reach the site and lt. @entity171 takes over			1
the 30 - year - old officer earns less than $ 300 a month , risking his life every day to disable these deadly devices			1
i ask how much experience he has , and he tells me : " it 's not my first time			0
i have defused 70 ieds in @entity133 in seven days when i was there with the @entity3			0
" when i ask him why he does this dangerous line of work he replies : " if i lose my life it would n't be a problem			1
but if others die while i am doing this then i would feel bad because i do n't want others to die			0
this is my job -- to save my people from the risk of these ieds			0
" as he lies on his stomach assessing the area , he digs with his hands to remove the earth			0
he slowly stands up and sweeps the metal detector over and over again , making sure he identifies the exact spot before lying back in the dirt to continue digging			0
after 20 minutes , he stands up and declares the site is clear explaining the @entity156 must have removed the ied after it had been reported to the police , or a local came and took it to claim the $ 100 reward			1
as we walk back to the @entity260 i ask lt. @entity171 how he feels about the @entity4 - led coalition pulling out of @entity1 by 2014			1
he says : " it would n't make a difference to me if they leave because it is my country and i will keep doing my job			0

coalition forces engaged in transition of power to @entity109 ( @entity109 )
but spate of so - called " green on blue " attacks on coalition troops has *hastened* the process
lt. @entity171 risks his life serving in the @entity109 for $ 300 per month
he says the coalition *withdrawal* means nothing to him ; he still has to do his duty
