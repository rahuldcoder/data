-- for many of us , eating out happens more often than we would like to admit			2
it 's only natural that with our busy , ca n't - catch - a - break lifestyles we farm out cooking to our favorite local restaurants			0
that 's ok -- it 's not so much eating out that 's the problem			2
rather , it 's what we eat at restaurants that can cause health issues			0
too many carbohydrates , too much fat and too much salt can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes , hypertension and cholesterol issues			0
the problem is , restaurant menus are designed to entice your sense of taste , not tell you whether the foods they 're advertising are healthy			1
but i 'm here to take the guesswork out of dining out			0
calorie bombs away ! the worst chain restaurant dishes are ... fried foods restaurant code words : crunchy , tempura , battered , crispy , breaded , crusted , golden , sizzling if you 're making a healthy choice , you 're probably not purposely choosing a fried food item			1
look for words like crunchy , battered , crispy , breaded , crusted , golden , tempura ; some of these options are a double - whammy on your caloric intake because the item is fried with an additional carb - based coating			1
fried foods may taste great , but tend to be high in fat and calories -- and deep frying robs food of nutrients			2
a grilled , baked or roasted 4 - ounce chicken breast ( the size of a deck of cards ) will run you about 170 calories , whereas the deep fried selection can pack a whopping 370 calories			1
to make matters worse , many restaurants ( usually of the fast food variety ) use partially hydrogenated oil because it can be reheated and reused over and over again			0
partially hydrogenated oil contains trans fats ( the worst of the fats ) which raises your @entity66 ( bad cholesterol ) and lowers your @entity68 ( good cholesterol ) , leading to a higher incidence of heart disease			0
guilt - free eating : 10 nutrition myths debunked high - sugar foods restaurant code words : teriyaki , bbq , glazed , sticky , honey - dipped powdered doughnuts may be self - explanatory on a menu , but options labeled as @entity76 , bbq , glazed , sticky or honey - dipped could also be high in added sugars			1
it is wise to ask if sauces of any kind are made with sugar , including salad dressings and vinaigrettes			0
watch out also for meals that are high in carbohydrates			0
carbs turn into sugar when they are broken down by your digestive system			0
the usual suspects are items like pasta , potatoes and rice , but even menu items like " healthy " couscous , quinoa and faro are high in carbs and should be eaten with the same moderation as traditional offerings			2
how much sugar is in that drink ? high - calorie foods restaurant code words : loaded , stuffed , creamy , cheesy , gooey , smothered , melted , rich , velvety it 's funny how adjectives describing foods can elicit @entity115 's law in even the most rigorous health fanatic			1
@entity118 described as loaded , stuffed , creamy , cheesy , gooey , smothered , melted , rich and velvety are triggering a " feeling " that you get when you eat that particular menu item			1
do n't fall into the trap ! these " comfort foods " may take you back in time to a simpler place where a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich on brioche could right all of the wrongs in the world , but the one wrong it wo n't right is the number of calories packed into one bite			2
something described as " loaded " or " stuffed " is going to also be loaded or stuffed with calories -- and no one wants to feel like a @entity140 turkey			1
eating out costs you 200 calories healthier options restaurant code words : roasted , baked , braised , broiled , poached , rubbed , seared , grilled , steamed , @entity143 ed , spiced , seasoned chefs at local restaurants everywhere are catching on that @entity147 are looking for healthier options when dining out			1
restaurants that specialize in foods that are " made - to - order " or that focus on locally sourced foods will likely have more options			0
even some fast - casual restaurants are retooling mainstays and developing new menu items that wo n't bust your caloric intake for the day			0
words like roasted , poached , baked or grilled are your best options -- just do n't order the grilled 26 - ounce ribeye steak			1
do n't be afraid to ask questions about the menu , and if nutritional information is available , read through and choose the meal that will balance your health with your desire for something tasty .			2

there are healthy restaurant menu choices while eating out
crunchy , battered , crispy , breaded , crusted , golden and tempura are code words for fried
@entity118 described as " loaded " or " stuffed " is likely loaded and stuffed with calories
choose roasted , baked , braised , broiled , poached , seared , grilled or steamed
