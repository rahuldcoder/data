-- for well over a century the world has come to call on @entity2 , @entity3 , every day of the year			1
" i know the town would miss it , " said @entity2 's mayor , @entity4			1
" i hope it does n't come to that			0
" he was talking about the @entity9 , the big @entity11 passenger train that runs daily between @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity2 , with a population of around 28,000 , has had its own daily passenger railroad service since the town was founded in rural southwest @entity3 in the late 1800s			1
the @entity17 sent its glamorous trains through @entity3 on their way east and west			1
@entity2 built its train station right downtown			1
to have the station there made the town part of the grand and glorious thread that , railroad - stop - by - railroad - stop , connected the still - young nation , the thread that made the country seem , and feel , cohesive and whole			1
when @entity11 took over the passenger railroads in the early 1970s , many cities around the country -- some much larger than @entity2 -- lost train service , and the need for their stations			1
twice each day , sundays and holidays included , the @entity9 pulls to a full stop downtown to let passengers get off and let passengers get on			0
residents who live nearby can literally stroll over to the train station , hop on the @entity9 , and step off at the end of the line in @entity13			2
but even for residents who never use the @entity9 , its presence is a symbol			2
the whistle sounds , as it has since the 1800s , and it signals that men and women from large cities and small will be stopping , however briefly , in their town , at their station			2
" you take pride in that sort of thing , " said @entity54 , a member of the city commission			0
" just knowing it 's there			0
when you see that train roll in , it 's like listening to an old song that you love			0
" when i was a boy , my father , my two brothers and i would ride the train to @entity71 every summer to see a ballgame			0
they were the @entity74 then ; they were n't yet the @entity75			0
we 'd stay at the @entity77			0
every time i see or hear that train , that 's what i think about : my dad and my brothers and riding through @entity3 on our way to see big - league baseball			1
" nothing is forever , though , and the possibility that the @entity9 may , within a few years , no longer come through @entity2 is one of those stories built on dry , arcane economic facts			2
the great majority of tracks that @entity11 rolls over are not owned by @entity11 , but are used through financial arrangements with the freight railroads			1
the tracks that run through @entity2 's portion of @entity3 and parts of @entity97 and @entity98 are owned by @entity99			1
all across the @entity101 , between the renowned metropolises , are smaller towns that generations ago were selected to have their own stations -- stopping - off points -- and thus were accorded a special kind of enduring identity			1
this spring , the @entity109 reported , @entity11 and @entity99 held a meeting in @entity2 with representatives of the communities the @entity9 serves in those three states -- towns including @entity115 , @entity3 ; @entity116 , @entity97 ; @entity117 , @entity98			1
the @entity109 reported that , because of the cost of maintaining the old tracks , the @entity9 may , within the next several years , be switched to an entirely different @entity99 route , farther south			2
the sums involved are not paltry			0
according to the @entity109 , if the @entity9 is to stay on its traditional route with its traditional stations , $ 10 million per year for track - maintenance costs and a total of $ 100 million for long - term improvements must be found			2
if not , the alternate , passenger - train - ready @entity99 tracks many miles to the south beckon			2
it might not make much difference to the long - haul passengers who are riding between @entity12 and @entity133 and do n't much care where the train stops along the way			1
and it certainly wo n't make any difference to all the travelers who fly in jet airplanes across the country and seldom look down			0
but there is something about a small town that has never gone a single day , in almost 150 years , without a passenger train pulling in and pausing to see if anyone would like to step out onto the streets of @entity2 , or if anyone from @entity2 would like to climb aboard and join the other cross-continental travelers ... " you get on the southwest chief downtown , " @entity54 said , " and within five minutes @entity2 is all behind you			1
you 're gone , just that quickly			0
" when the interstate highway system was built , it managed to leave @entity2 out , he said ; it is an 80 - mile drive on two - lane state roads to the nearest entrance to @entity157			1
" it would be a setback if we were to lose the passenger train , " said @entity158 , the city manager			0
" we like to think we are the center of activities in western @entity3 , and having the daily train service is an important part of that			2
" and , of course , there is the romance of the rails , a romance that has somehow been able to survive all of @entity11 's struggles -- even in an era that proclaims a digital , virtual world can transport a person anywhere without that person ever leaving home			1
when you 're boarding a long - distance train , you are not boarding a number			0
you are boarding a name that sounds like an orchestral overture : the @entity183 ; the @entity184 ; the @entity185			0
or the @entity9 , bound for @entity2 and points beyond			2
after the 1959 murders of four members of the @entity191 family in a farmhouse in nearby @entity193 , author @entity187 would arrive by train at the @entity2 station to do the reporting that would result in the book " in @entity198			1
" the young county prosecutor in the case , @entity201 , who would help to send killers @entity202 and @entity204 to execution by hanging , is 80 now , and still lives in @entity2			2
he said that he and his wife , @entity206 , have gone down to meet the @entity9 twice in the past few weeks			0
" we had friends visit from @entity209 , " he said			0
" we went to the station to greet them , and we went to the station to see them off			0
" efforts are under way to find financing to maintain the old tracks so the @entity9 will keep arriving in @entity2 every day , as it always has			1
and , with the clock ticking , if its time in town should end ? if , before the end of this decade , the train is moved to a distant set of tracks ? the world will continue to spin			1
the @entity109 reported that in 2011 , the station in downtown @entity2 served 7,511 passengers			1
a nice number , but not one that is likely to halt cold - eyed economic decisions			0
yet the importance of something like this to a place can not be brushed aside			0
mayor @entity4 , who also runs the local @entity236 pizza franchise , said that from his house he can hear the @entity9 pulling into town on its journey across @entity101 early each morning and late each night			1
" i kind of enjoy listening to it , " he said			0
" you 'll hear that whistle , and on some days , when i have the windows open and the wind is right , i can hear the sound of the train idling at the station before it pulls out			0
" it 's part of our life			0
and once it 's gone , it 's gone			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

@entity254 says the @entity11 station is a beloved *fixture* of @entity2 , @entity3
he says the @entity12 - to - @entity260 connects town to the nation
he says *townfolk* are seeking alternatives to moving the tracks
@entity254 : if the station closes , the world will go on , but town will lose symbol of place in @entity101
