@entity0 -- film - maker and artist @entity2 grew up idolizing @entity4 , the trailblazing @entity5 boxing great who was a hero to her @entity7 father and millions of others around the world			1
" my dad had incredible love for him , " she told @entity1 at the opening of her latest exhibition , " @entity17 , " currently on display in @entity0 's @entity14 gallery			2
" it was the first time i saw a very strong black person , who was so unapologetic and beautiful			0
" so when she moved to @entity20 -- a coastal town with a maritime heritage in northeast @entity22 -- and heard that one of the 20th century 's most celebrated athletes had had his marriage blessed in an @entity27 ceremony at the local mosque , she found it hard to believe			1
" i said ' what ? ' i 'd lived in the north for eight years and never heard about it			0
i knew i had to find out more			0
" @entity4 , she learned , had visited @entity20 in 1977 with his new wife , @entity34 , and their baby daughter @entity35 , in response to an invitation to come to the area to raise money for the @entity41 , a @entity42 charitable organization			1
the visit -- which drew thousands out lining the streets to watch his procession through the town -- reached its high point with a marriage blessing ceremony by the imam at the town 's @entity51			2
intrigued by the story , @entity2 spent two years making a film -- " @entity55 of @entity20 " -- about @entity4 's unlikely visit , which led to an enduring relationship with the town 's longstanding @entity59 community , whose mosque had hosted the boxer and for whom the day had provided an important validation of their sometimes tenuous place in @entity42 society			1
in the process of making the film , she realized that many of the elders of the @entity20 @entity59 -- one of the @entity42 's oldest @entity72 and @entity73 communities -- were passing away , their rich stories vanishing with them			1
" i was seeing something that was about to disappear and i thought this is so fascinating , i need to capture this , " she said			0
" now their world is almost gone			0

the outsized portraits , said @entity2 , hand - colored in the style of old @entity98 movie posters , were intended to present the men " in a way that aggrandizes them , " in contrast to the " social realist " depictions that had typically been used to portray their community			1
" whenever they were shown , they 'd typically be in the mosque , everything would look very miserable and a bit dirty , " she said			0
" i thought that 's not who they are			0
they were funny , they would flirt with me and were full of life			0
" the name of the exhibition , she said , referred to lines written by the @entity59 poet @entity124 , who wrote in 1995 that " our land is the dictionary of our people			2
" the story of @entity20 ' @entity59 community began in the 1890s , when seamen from the @entity42 ruled @entity133 -- now part of modern day @entity59 -- began working on @entity42 ships , eventually finding their way to port towns in @entity42			1
the @entity42 's first mosque was opened in @entity140 , @entity141 , by @entity59 who had come to @entity42 as seamen			1
@entity2 said the @entity59 were recruited by the @entity42 as they made good sailors -- they did n't drink , and could handle the heat of the engine room furnaces well			1
during the @entity147 , the @entity42 government began encouraging @entity59 men into the country to make up for a manpower shortage brought about by the conflict			1
by the war 's end , the @entity59 population of the northern shipping town had risen to about 3,000 , and as many as 800 had been killed on merchant navy supply ships at sea			2
" they were working on ships that the @entity160 were very keen to bomb , so there 's an extraordinary number of @entity59 men who died , " said @entity2			1
but the new arrivals were not initially welcomed by the public at large			0
discrimination meant they found it hard to find accommodation , with the seamen mostly forced to live in boarding houses -- the first of which opened in the town in 1909 -- largely isolated from the wider community			0
after the war , the boarding houses suffered attacks intended to drive the @entity73 from the town			0
perceptions of unfair treatment in the workplace led to riots in 1919 and 1930 , and eventually led to the council segregating the community by building an estate to house the @entity59			2

as part of her research , @entity2 commissioned a survey team to ask 100 people on @entity20 ' main street about their ancestry , and about one in four claimed some @entity59 heritage			1
today , many of those @entity20 locals -- who speak with the distinctive northeastern accent known as @entity201 -- are returning to @entity59 to reconnect with the culture of their forefathers , said @entity2			1
@entity20 ' @entity73 community is often held up as an example of an immigration success story			2
" the @entity59 have been incredibly dutiful to this country , " she said			2
" they 've worked very hard for this country , and they love @entity42 very much because they know what they 've gotten from here			2
" for his part , @entity214 , one of the men profiled in the exhibition , was nonplussed by the attention			0
" when the people came to talk and take the picture , we did n't know this would happen , " he said , bemused by the art crowd gathered at the exhibition 's opening			2
he arrived in @entity20 as a seaman in 1967 , and returns every two years			0
" it brings back memories , " he said of the portraits , adding that he had a copy of his portrait hanging in his home			0
@entity2 said that in her eyes the community 's humility was the reason the community had integrated into @entity42 so successfully			1
" they go into a community and they assimilate , they adopt the rule of where they live and that 's the reason the @entity59 have sort of disappeared in a sense			1
" it was part of the reason she thought their story should be heard			0
" there is that swing at the moment in @entity42 -- a concern that ' these guys are invading , this is problematic			0
' it 's not problematic			0
these guys have been here since 1890 and it 's going fine			0
