-- one evening , when i was 24 years old , i heard dr. @entity2 speak to a small classroom of @entity5 students			1
i was not a student at the time , so i crashed the lecture and sat quietly on the steps in the back of the room			0
what i heard that night changed my life			0
dr. @entity2 spoke of his journey in creating the @entity15 , which provides small loans to the poor			1
he told us about the incredible success many of @entity15 's clients had achieved , breaking the cycle of poverty in their lives with only a few borrowed dollars and an entrepreneurial spirit			1
but beyond sharing his story , and beyond explaining the power of microfinance to change people 's lives , @entity2 spoke about the poor in a way i 'd never before heard			1
he described them as hardworking , motivated , intelligent entrepreneurs who had the power to improve their own lives -- not hopeless , desperate , devastated individuals waiting for a donor to make everything better			1
watch an interview with @entity43 many of my assumptions about poverty , and about my role in helping to alleviate it , were turned upside down			1
( a few years after that evening lecture , @entity2 and his @entity15 won the 2006 @entity50 , honoring their work pioneering modern microfinance			1
) listening to @entity2 speak that night , i was inspired to do something			1
i wanted to meet hardworking entrepreneurs like the ones he 'd talked about , and to truly understand their stories			2
a few weeks later , i quit my job at @entity5 and boarded a plane to @entity60 , @entity61 , to try to do just that			0
@entity63 : @entity64 on " the bottom billion " over the next few months , i interviewed over a hundred entrepreneurs throughout @entity67 who had received $ 100 to start or grow their microenterprises			2
i formed powerful connections with many of those entrepreneurs , all of whom were working hard every day to lift themselves and others out of poverty -- a seamstress in @entity61 who used her business profits to send her daughters to school ; a goat - herder in @entity82 who could finally afford mosquito nets for his family ; a farmer in @entity87 who explained proudly how she could now , for the first time , feed her children three meals a day			1
these dignified individuals showed me how even a simple endeavor could be run with incredible acumen , creativity , and wisdom			0
it was through their stories of perseverance and optimism that my beliefs about poverty , about empowerment , about entrepreneurship , and about my own path began to shift			2
i wondered how the world might be different if more people could hear their stories , in detail , one at a time			2
and i wondered what it would be like to participate in the next chapter of their stories in a way that dignified them , not pitied them			0
what if a community of people could gather together to lend the next few hundred dollars they needed for their businesses to grow ? my desire to answer these questions inspired the creation of @entity123 ( @entity126 / ) , the world 's first peer - to - peer microlending website			1
on @entity123 , people can lend as little as $ 25 to specific entrepreneurs and get their money back when the entrepreneur repays			1
in a little over five years since its founding , @entity123 has been one of the fastest - growing social benefit websites in history , facilitating more than $ 170 million in loans across 208 countries			0
building on lessons learned at @entity123 , i 've now turned my attention back home to focus on serving small business here in the @entity141 as co-founder and ceo of @entity144 ( @entity145 / )			0
@entity144 is a crowd - funding platform for @entity141 entrepreneurs to raise investments from their friends , families and communities			2
an unlimited number of unaccredited investors can invest and choose either to receive a share of the business 's revenues as cash , or redirect them to a nonprofit			0
@entity63 : @entity159 takes a new look at @entity67 entrepreneurs can create a simple fundraising website including legally compliant investment terms , raise seed capital online , manage their community of supporters , pay investors dividends over time , provide regular updates on their business 's progress , and much more			2
it is my hope that @entity144 can change the way we support small businesses and start - ups in @entity141			0
i believe in their ability to make positive change in the world			0
i want to see a world in which every entrepreneur has access to the resources he or she needs to succeed , and where through the power of supportive communities -- that means you and me -- every resource can be made available			0
whether you are a goat - herder in the @entity191 , a tech start - up guru in @entity193 , or someone simply eager to see an entrepreneur succeed , i invite you to join me			0
there is a new story to be written together			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity43 .			1

@entity43 was inspired by the example of @entity2
she says microlending enables people to break free of the cycle of poverty
@entity43 : entrepreneurs have the power to improve their own lives
