@entity0 -- in @entity4 's protest hub , the big decisions are made by consensus			2
each day in the privately owned @entity7 , where @entity9 protesters have encamped for more than a month , demonstrators engage in a slow , seemingly cumbersome process of making their voices heard			1
the group , which calls itself occupy @entity9 , arranges in a half - circle inside the city 's financial district for what demonstrators say is their @entity17 , listening to the concerns of those who decide to participate before voting on issues thought to affect them all			1
police prevent the use of loudspeakers			0
so the group , undeterred , instead echoes the voice of whomever is speaking , rendering their comments much more audible to the hundreds that gather each day			0
and their topics range : from the practical ( such as where to march and when ) to the mundane ( like concerns about trash collection ) , nothing reaches a conclusion until almost the entire group agrees			0
@entity9 demonstrations start second month the meetings , meanwhile , have cropped up in other cities , while similar demonstrations have taken hold in dozens of cities nationwide and around the world			1
the protesters in @entity7 commonly say it 's democracy in action , and it works			1
" the idea of a @entity17 -- a place where people can air their grievances against the government -- that does not happen anymore in @entity56 , " said @entity48 , a protester and camp volunteer			1
" we have created that space here , so i already think we are a success			0
" but the process can be messy			1
at a recent @entity17 meeting in @entity0 , a demonstrator -- unhappy with the agreed - to rules banning drugs and alcohol -- decided he would be disruptive , even announcing his intention to the group			1
the group , however , permitted his comments , apparently not wanting to alienate anyone			0
earlier this month , rep. @entity71 , @entity72 , showed up at an @entity9 demonstration in @entity74 and asked if he could address the crowd			1
the distinguished civil rights leader wanted to speak to the people in his district , and at first , it looked like he had the support of the group			0
but then , one man , while acknowledging @entity71 ' contributions to society , said the @entity9 movement is a @entity86 process , " in which no singular human being is inherently more valuable than any other human being			1
" that led to a 10 - minute group discussion before it was decided by consensus that @entity71 should not be allowed to speak			2
blog : ' occupy ' movement goes global consensus - building through a group process clearly has its shortcomings			1
but some experts on the democratic process see it as an effective means to an end			2
" setting an effective group process , we think , is really the only way to move things forward , " said @entity104 , director of the leadership @entity0 program at the @entity108 @entity107			2
@entity108 is a nonpartisan , nonprofit organization that trains people to be effective , ethical leaders in a @entity86 system			0
" having a consensus decision - making process allows for inclusivity and also more of a sense of buy - in and ownership , " @entity104 said , " so when decisions do get made , things can move forward a little more rapidly			1
" she has high hopes that the @entity9 movement will effect change in some way			1
" because they are committed to this process , what they agree on is becoming more and more abstract , " the co-founder of @entity129 said			0
his company is often called to help organizations turn a bunch of good ideas and recommendations into action with a positive outcome			2
he does n't see that happening with @entity9			2
" i think that 's the danger of this kind of process , " @entity127 said			2
" if we say we 're going to operate by consensus , which is everybody has to agree , well , the only way you can get everybody to agree when people have different agendas is to agree on something that is so ethereal as to be meaningless			0
" @entity127 warns that this addiction to a process in which everybody has a voice could spell the demise for @entity9			1
his advice to people taking part in the demonstrations is to run for office , work for a campaign and learn from the tea party			0
" @entity167 folks understood that if they were actually going to create change as opposed to just complain ... they had to figure out a way to influence directly the decisions that people made			0
" one thing @entity127 thinks the @entity9 movement has working in its favor is that it 's constantly growing			1
" these folks -- like the tea party people -- have numbers , " he said , " and numbers in a @entity86 setting are an incredibly important resource and a powerful counterweight to dollars			0
" in order for that to be an effective tool in achieving whatever it is the @entity9 movement eventually decides to do , @entity127 said someone is going to have to assume leadership			1
" if someone were to actually try to shape and form that movement into something that actually might effect change , that person is going to annoy a lot of those people in @entity7			0
" @entity127 said anyone in a leadership role within the movement will automatically make enemies because he or she will have to put some people 's agendas on hold			2
the leadership role is starting to be filled , not by one person but two dozen people			0
they call themselves the @entity206			0
they 're meeting regularly in @entity0 to discuss possible actionable demands : a list they can present to the entire movement			0
this being a group process , they say the eventual list will be adopted only if it is approved by more than two - thirds of the @entity9 demonstrators .			1

@entity9 has lasted more than a month
protesters get organized with daily meetings called their @entity17
protesters say this is democracy in action , but the movement 's *future* *remains* *unclear*
decision - making process , use of inclusivity can be slow and messy , but movement is growing
