-- police believe they found the skeletal remains of a 3 - year - old @entity5 boy and were charging his father with two counts of murder as they prepared to search for the man 's missing young daughter , also believed dead , authorities said wednesday			1
authorities are working to verify the remains found wednesday near @entity13 , @entity14 , belong to @entity15			1
police believe he was killed by his father , @entity19 , 27 , and the father 's girlfriend			1
@entity15 had not been seen since june , police in @entity23 , @entity5 , said			1
investigators believe he was slain around that time			0
his sister , 4 - year - old @entity25 , was last seen in march , when authorities believe she was killed			1
earlier , police had reversed the order of the last sightings of the children , but they clarified that timeline wednesday			2
police , who did not know the children were missing until november 19 , contend that the elder @entity15 allowed the girlfriend , @entity34 , to abuse the children by restraining them with tape , putting socks in their mouths and confining them			1
the boy 's skeletal remains were found about 12 miles north of @entity13 , after the boy 's father -- who is in police custody in @entity5 -- gave authorities information on where the body might be buried , said @entity46 , @entity14 , sheriff @entity47			1
" it was the father who gave us the general area , " @entity47 told @entity48			2
" he was n't real sure exactly where he was			0
... he claimed he had taken a lot of sleeping pills and did n't quite remember exactly where he was			0
" based on that information , the sheriff 's office cordoned off a five - mile stretch along a highway and dispatched eight 10 - man teams to locate the remains			2
the body was found about 10:30 a.m. , @entity47 said			2
" we 're very certain " the remains are that of the missing boy , @entity47 said			2
" we 're just thankful that we found this little boy			0
nothing 's left but just the skeletal remains			2
" the body of @entity69 has not been found , @entity47 said , but he indicated authorities believe it near @entity72 , @entity5 , about 50 miles north of @entity23			1
a spokesman for @entity74 told @entity48 that prosecutors are signing two murder warrants against @entity77			2
authorities will decide in the next few days whether to charge @entity80 in the deaths , officer @entity78 said			2
police believe both children died in @entity23 , @entity78 said			2
@entity78 was not sure when the search for @entity25 near @entity72 will begin in earnest			1
" this is a one - step - at - a - time , one - day - at - a - time operation , " @entity78 said			0
" we 've had some success with it today			0
we 're going to evaluate our results , then begin the next step			0
" @entity78 said he was relieved at the new findings , but said the investigation had taken a toll			0
" i have kids that are of similar age and it makes me think about them while i 'm out here , " @entity78 told @entity48			0
investigators believe that after @entity15 's death , @entity77 , @entity80 and @entity25 continued to live in the @entity101 in @entity23 for months , @entity78 said monday			1
they did n't leave until the summer , after @entity25 was last seen in june			0
" it 's really terrible , as if nobody really cared , " @entity78 said of the time that transpired between the sightings and launch of the search			0
" that 's what we ca n't seem to understand at this point			0
" both @entity15 and @entity80 are now in custody , and blaming each other for the siblings ' deaths			1
the investigation kicked off november 18 , when @entity80 told @entity117 , @entity118 , police that she needed protection from @entity15 , who she claimed was holding her against her will			1
according to the domestic violence petition , signed " @entity127 , " she said , " i feel he may have murdered his children , because he said they were non-responsive			0
he would not let me check on them			0
" she said @entity15 had told her " choices were made ... and he had to do what he had to do			1
" @entity80 was arrested last week , charged with two counts of willful abuse and neglect of a child			0
three days later , @entity137 -- who for two days had been hosting @entity138 , his longtime friend -- called @entity140 , @entity141 , police after hearing news reports about the children 's disappearance , according to a report from the county sheriff 's department			0
when @entity137 asked @entity15 about it , the children 's father yelled , " i did n't do it " and left the home , the report said			1
police eventually tracked down @entity15 , who again asserted his innocence before his arrest friday			1
he had been charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of abuse of a corpse -- the latter because , @entity78 said , of his " disposing of the bodies in the woods			0
" @entity15 had a first appearance on the abuse charges wednesday and a judge entered a not guilty plea , said @entity168 , who was assigned to represent the father at the @entity23 proceedings			1
@entity171 described his client as being very upset about developments			0
a preliminary hearing is scheduled for january 4			0
on monday , @entity176 district judge @entity175 set bail for @entity15 at $ 206,000 -- $ 100,000 each for the child abuse charges and $ 3,000 for each count of corpse abuse , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity181			1
according to a police complaint , @entity15 between march 1 and november 19 allowed @entity80 to tape @entity25 's hands and feet , put a sock in her mouth and place her in a suitcase that was put in a closet for 14 hours			1
he also allowed @entity80 to tape @entity15 's hands to the side of his legs , tape a broom handle to his back , place a sock in his mouth and then make the child stand in a corner all night when the couple went to bed			2
@entity15 and @entity80 had one infant daughter together , according to @entity80 's account in the @entity118 police report			1
police said one reason @entity80 claimed she needed protection from @entity15 was that she feared for the safety of the infant , who was with her in @entity118			1
@entity78 said the two slain children 's biological mother lives in @entity23 , but she did not have custody " because , at the time , she did n't have a place to live			0
" @entity0 's @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 contributed to this report .			0
