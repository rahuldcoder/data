on my first full day in the most economically divided county in @entity3 , people started telling me about the man who wanders the streets here with an @entity3 flag wrapped around his shoulders			1
everyone knew him , but no one had many details			1
me : where will i find him ? you know , around			1
me : right ... like where , though ? near the lake , maybe			1
sight unseen , this man became a sort of mythical being for me -- a representation of the soul of this part of the @entity23 , where a body of water and centuries of history largely separate the rich from poor			1
surely , he must have something to say about the @entity30			1
as i wandered around both sides of @entity32 , the town and the sickle - shaped body of water that separates the rich on the north from the poor on the south , i looked for the man with the @entity3 flag at every turn -- on @entity42 , with its boarded - up businesses ; at the @entity44 , a local gathering point ; near a cemetery , where locals go to scratch off lottery tickets ; at the dock , a restaurant with a cartoonish red crawfish on the roof and warning signs for alligators			1
i struck out , again and again			1
i began to wonder whether the man and the flag actually existed			1
there 's that scene in every great @entity59 film ( and in a dream sequence in " @entity62 " ) where the cowboy looks across the desert and sees an elder or shaman in the heat - rippled haze of the horizon			1
maybe all of these people imagined the man and his flag ? maybe they wanted a source of hope in a place that 's about as economically depressed and desperate as they come			1
about 40 % of people in the parish live in poverty			1
there would be good cause for a mirage			2
a reason for an imaginary mascot			2
but then , five days into the trip , i saw him he was sitting on a metal parking barrier off @entity86			1
i was scheduled to interview the owner of @entity88 , a rare new - business success story in a town that needs plenty more of those			1
but i knew i would miss him if i went to the interview			2
hell , i was worried if i looked away , he would disappear			2
i peeked my head into the restaurant as quickly as i could to say that i was going to be a few minutes , sorry , but something had just come up			2
as i walked toward him across the parking lot , i tried to look nonchalant but also wanted to catch his attention by waving , which is an impossible combination -- one employed successfully only by mormon missionaries or maybe sex offenders			2
i said hello -- hi , ahem , my name is @entity105 , and i 'm from @entity106			2
i 'm working on this story , and @entity108 , well , i 've heard about you			2
( ! ) i mean , i 've heard about you			2
(...) @entity111 , 59 , was kind enough to speak with me			2
the @entity3 flag was neatly folded and wrapped around a backpack , not his shoulders			1
he was wearing several layers of clothing , a dress shirt , a tie , a tuxedo vest and a jacket			1
it felt like 100 degrees that day			2
few clouds , if any			2
as we talked , he wiped beads of sweat from his face			2
but he looked completely and remarkably dapper for a person who walks five , six , seven , eight miles a day -- going nowhere and everywhere in particular			2
he wears a large backpack , he said , to stop his back from hurting			0
@entity111 ' parents both died when he was relatively young , and he dropped out of school in seventh grade			0
he has struggled with mental health issues , he told me			0
he survives on government disability insurance			0
" i 'd rather work than just be sitting here waiting on a check , " he said			1
but there are n't many jobs here , and he 's largely given up			0
i told him about the gist of my project			0
i was in @entity143 because it has the highest level of income inequality -- the biggest rich - poor gap -- of any parish or county in the country			1
@entity32 is the parish 's largest town			1
@entity111 told me knows nothing about the wealth that exists in the parish			1
that 's all on the other side of the lake , far away			0
but he knows about the poverty			0
" it 's just like anybody else , " he said			0
" surviving 's about the best you can do			0
" he lives in a rental house owned by his sister @entity164			0
she 's never understood why her brother walks so much			0
they have 12 siblings in all , and he 's the only one who insists on walking the streets all day , sometimes into the night			1
there are many stories i could tell you about @entity174 , but i 'll leave you with two , both about objects he carries with him at all times as he walks around @entity32			0
the first , inside his backpack , is a cornet			0
@entity111 used to play taps and did so at his mother 's funeral			0
now he marches up and down the streets playing his horn , but only if he feels that @entity185 wants him to			1
he has n't felt that calling in weeks			0
his sister told a slightly different tale			0
" everyone used to love to hear him blow it , " she said later			0
" i 'm sure they would love to hear it now , but he smokes too many cigarettes			0
" in a nod to one my new favorite philosophers , @entity197 , whose 1971 book " @entity199 " is a staple among inequality wonks , i asked @entity111 whether he thought his life would have been different if he were born on the other side of the lake -- if he were born into wealth rather than relative poverty			1
my heart broke when he answered			0
" i probably would have been a college graduate , " he said			0
" i probably would ... i do n't know what i would 've been			0
( an ) architect ? but i 've always been inclined to music , because everybody loves music			0
" i ai n't got no teeth in the front , but i still blow my horn , " he said			0
the second object is the flag			1
@entity111 found it crumpled up and discarded on the edge of @entity32 , the symbolically named lake that 's the barrier between rich and poor			1
" it was abandoned , and i was abandoned , and he seen me , and i needed it			0
" he told me he was collecting money to have the flag dry - cleaned			1
he was embarrassed by how dirty it had become			0
a few weeks later , on a second trip to @entity32 , i saw @entity174 walking by the cemetery			0
i stopped to say hi and asked about the flag			1
he revived my belief in humanity when he told me a local dry cleaner tidied it up , free of charge .			0

@entity143 , @entity239 , has the highest income inequality in @entity3
@entity242 visits the parish to try to learn what could narrow the rich - poor gap
one man he met wanders the streets wearing an @entity3 flag
" i 'd rather work than just be sitting here waiting on a check , " he says
