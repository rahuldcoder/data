@entity0 -- a same - sex couple has been turned away at the @entity3 in a cross-state dispute to have both of them officially listed as the parents of an adopted 5 - year - old boy			1
the justices rejected the @entity12 couple 's appeal tuesday without comment			0
the couple claims that @entity15 , where the child was born , has an unconstitutional policy against adoption by unmarried partners			2
the state used that policy to justify naming only one of them on an amended birth certificate			1
the men , @entity25 and @entity26 , argue gay couples have a due process right to be listed on such certificates as joint custodial parents			2
a federal appeals court ruled against the couple earlier this year			0
some civil rights groups had urged a high court review , saying the case would have broader implications in the current legal fight in state and federal courts over same - sex marriage and whether states -- and @entity0 -- must honor legal rights that gays and lesbians enjoy in other states			1
the men , who live in @entity47 , legally adopted a 1 year - old boy from @entity49 , @entity15 , in 2006			2
the adoption was finalized in @entity51 , where the couple was then residing			0
in their appeal , spearheaded by the gay rights advocacy group @entity54 , the couple said it was important both practically and symbolically they both be listed as the legal parents			1
" obtaining an amended birth certificate that accurately identifies both parents of an adopted child is vitally important for multiple purposes , including determining the parents ' and child 's right to make medical decisions for other family members at the necessary moments ; determining custody , care , and support of the child in the event of a separation or divorce between the parents , " the legal brief said			1
lawyers for the men also said it is vitally necessary for @entity81 and tax purposes , inheritance , insurance , school registration , and obtaining a passport			0
@entity25 and @entity26 tried to have the birth certificate changed in @entity15			1
all states have laws creating a right to accurate , amended official birth and identity documents that would be recognized in other states and by the federal government			0
@entity95 , @entity15 's registrar of vital records and statistics , refused their request			2
she took the position that the term " adoptive parents " in the applicable section of state law applies only to married parents , because in @entity15 , only married couples may jointly adopt a child			1
@entity15 state officials argued they did not refuse to recognize the @entity51 adoption decree , and had offered to list one of the parents on the official amended birth certificate			1
but @entity25 and @entity26 insisted both of them should be named			0
in a statement , @entity54 said it was disappointed in the court 's discretion to stay out of the dispute			2
" this decision leaves adopted children and their parents vulnerable in their interactions with officials from other states , " said @entity121 , a senior staff attorney with the group			1
" more particularly , this decision leaves a child without an accurate birth certificate listing both his parents , " @entity121 added			1
" this issue now moves into the legislative arena			0
we need to push for a change in @entity15 state policy in order to stabilize and standardize respect for parent - child relationships for all adoptive children			1
" the 5th @entity141 in @entity142 ruled in april that @entity25 and @entity26 could not file a federal civil rights claim under the @entity145 's " full faith and credit " clause			0
that refers to @entity149 , section 1 , which says states must respect the " public acts , records , and judicial proceedings of every other state			0
" the full 16 - member court , in an 11 - 5 ruling , concluded the clause applies only to court actions , not those of state legislators or executive officials , and added that " there is no legal basis on which to conclude that failure to issue a revised birth certificate denies ' recognition ' to the @entity51 adoption decree			1
" more importantly , the court said states have the power to make their own decisions about issuing birth certificates			0
" adoption is not a fundamental right , " said the appeals court , citing studies that found marriage provides a more stable environment in which to raise children			0
" @entity15 has a legitimate interest in encouraging a stable and nurturing environment for the education and socialization of its adopted children			2
... @entity15 may rationally conclude that having parenthood focused on a married couple or single individual -- not on the freely severable relationship of unmarried partners -- furthers the interests of adopted children			2
" tuesday 's decision by the justices not to intervene is the final legal defeat for @entity25 and @entity26 on the certificate question , but does not affect their continuing custody of the boy			0
the case is @entity25 v. @entity26 , @entity202 ( 11 - 46 ) .			0

the couple wants both their names listed on birth certificate
@entity15 only recognizes married couples as adoptive parents
@entity54 says the decision leaves same - sex couples vulnerable
