@entity3 told investigators he began infusing @entity2 with the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia in april , a treatment that eventually killed the pop icon			2
@entity28 : @entity29 ' has no life ' since father 's death jurors in the trial of @entity2 's last concert promoter viewed the video depositions of @entity10 and two other witnesses wednesday ahead of a six - day break in testimony			1
@entity2 's mother and children are suing @entity9 , contending the company 's executives negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity3 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity2 's propofol overdose death			1

" defense expert : promoter did n't pressure @entity2 's doctor @entity3 told @entity1 's @entity89 in april that @entity2 had " his own stash " of propofol in his home before he began treating him with it			1
" i did not agree with @entity2 , but @entity2 felt that it was not an issue because he had been exposed to it for years and he knew exactly how things worked , " @entity3 said			2
" and given the situation at the time , it was my approach to try to get him off of it , but @entity2 was not the kind of person you can just say ' put it down ' and he 's going to do that			2
" @entity2 lawyers argue that @entity9 was negligent for not checking out @entity3 's distressed financial situation before agreeing to pay him $ 150,000 a month			1
it created a conflict of interest that led @entity3 to ignore safe practices and his responsibility to @entity2 's health , they contend			1
