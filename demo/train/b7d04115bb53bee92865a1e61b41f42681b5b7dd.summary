on wednesday , president @entity0 nominated @entity1 to be @entity3 ambassador to @entity4			1
it turns out the @entity1 family has an important legacy in @entity3 - @entity4 relations			1
@entity1 's father and uncle , @entity11 and @entity12 , played important roles in transforming a troubled @entity3 - @entity4 military alliance into the robust relationship the two countries enjoy today			1
in the 1950s , @entity3 were often contemptuous and distrustful toward @entity4 , which had very recently been a bitter enemy in @entity18 the @entity4 resented the post-war @entity3 occupation , resented the loss of territory ( such as @entity22 ) to the @entity3 , and feared that the @entity24 hostilities between the @entity3 and the @entity25 would drag @entity4 into war			2
in 1960 , @entity4 resentment boiled over in massive protests against renewal of the @entity3 - @entity4 alliance			1
as crowds filled @entity34 's streets and a political crisis rocked the @entity4 parliament , the movement to distance @entity4 from the @entity3 gained momentum			1
president - elect @entity1 feared the loss of a vital @entity24 ally			0
partnering with similarly worried leaders on the @entity4 side , he decided to take action			0
in the wake of @entity46 's dramatic foreign policy victories in @entity47 in 1958 when @entity46 was vice president , and after the @entity49 failure in 1961 , president @entity1 also knew he needed a diplomatic victory as he moved toward his re-election campaign			0
so , he envisioned a visit to @entity4 , the first by a sitting @entity3 president			2
@entity1 planned a dramatic reunion and affirmation of friendship between the crew of @entity59 ( @entity1 's storied boat that sank in the @entity61 in @entity18 ) , and the crew of @entity63 ( the @entity4 destroyer that sank it )			1
to advance the historic visit , the president sent his brother and a delegation to @entity34 in 1962			0
sadly , the reunion of the two crews was never to occur ; @entity1 's assassination the next year meant that a @entity3 president would not visit @entity4 until @entity75 's trip in 1974			1
although @entity11 never made the trip , it turns out that his brother 's visit had an important effect on the @entity3 - @entity4 relationship			1
@entity1 and his wife , @entity82 , met with @entity4 people from all walks of life : students , teachers , farmers , labor leaders			2
" @entity92 had such a disarming way ; they really charmed people , and were so genuine , " recalled @entity89 , a journalist who was part of the delegation			0
the legacy of the @entity12 visit also extended far beyond that week			0
to host the @entity92 , a group of pro-american business and political leaders on the @entity4 side formed what they called the " @entity101			0
" out of it grew several institutions , exchange programs , dialogues -- which over time helped knit together the two societies			0
among them were cabinet - level exchanges on the economy , scientific cooperation , culture and education			0
these institutions helped transform a narrow alliance into a deep and multifaceted relationship that today , in both countries , enjoys widespread popular support			0
it is this alliance that @entity1 must manage			0
though like - minded , deeply committed partners , the @entity3 and @entity4 today face many challenges that could strain their relationship			2
the @entity3 seeks @entity4 agreement to its ambitious free - trade regime -- the @entity125 , or @entity125			1
yet a thicket of @entity4 subsidies , trade barriers , and domestic political and economic interests hold @entity34 back			2
the issue of relocating a @entity3 military base that is in @entity22 remains unresolved , and -- most worryingly -- @entity4 's diplomatic crises with @entity133 over disputed @entity134 ( known in @entity133 as @entity135 , in @entity4 as @entity135 ) have elevated fears in @entity137			1
critics of @entity1 's nomination say she lacks the political or regional chops needed by an ambassador at such an important post			2
of course , an effective ambassador needs to know how to navigate the @entity137 policy - making process , a skill that one can develop through years of experience			0
on the @entity4 side , a good ambassador must be able to relate well to the people of the host country , and having deep area expertise facilitates this			0
but @entity1 actually looks pretty good on both counts			0
on the @entity3 side , a long political resume -- such as that of former @entity3 ambassadors to @entity4 @entity158 , @entity159 , or @entity160 -- is one route toward the influence needed to shape @entity3 policy			2
but @entity1 has that most precious policy - making asset of all : the president 's ear			1
by virtue of her vital 2008 endorsement of candidate @entity0 ( widely interpreted as pivotal in his primary battle against @entity171 ) , and by virtue of her subsequent work in key posts in his campaign , @entity1 has developed a close relationship with the president that will give her a powerful voice			2
@entity34 is praising the nomination			0
the @entity181 welcomed it as " reflecting the great importance the @entity0 administration attaches to the @entity4 - @entity3 alliance			1
" @entity4 diplomats have commented that because the @entity1 name carries tremendous cachet there , @entity1 's nomination will excite the people and create interest in the @entity3 embassy			1
this , they say , is a good thing for @entity3 - @entity4 relations			1
to some degree , of course , the @entity4 are excited by the nomination because of the star power of @entity199			0
but some of the excitement surely stems from their memory and appreciation of the important contributions of the @entity1 family to the @entity3 - @entity4 relationship , an important legacy from which the alliance continues to benefit , and which @entity1 is now tasked to continue .			1

@entity210 : @entity0 nominated @entity1 to be @entity3 ambassador to @entity4
she says efforts of @entity11 , @entity12 to fortify @entity3 - @entity4 relations left lasting good impression in @entity4
critiques of @entity1 as lacking experience should take this key legacy into *account*
@entity210 : she has @entity0 's ear -- and a legacy to uphold ; @entity34 *pleased* with the pick
