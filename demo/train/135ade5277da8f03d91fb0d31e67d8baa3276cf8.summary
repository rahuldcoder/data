editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- back in the mid-zeroes , i remember reading a lot of stories about a buildup of trash in the @entity25 so massive that it had formed a floating island of waste the size of @entity29			1
its colorful nickname was the @entity32 , and what was even more mind - boggling than the purported scale was that pretty much the only places you could dig up any substantial info about it were in minor oceanographic and environmental publications			1
you also could n't find a photo of it to save your life			0
@entity53 , the idea that one of the biggest environmental disasters of our age had been going on outside nearly everyone 's awareness piqued our curiosity , so we decided to head out there ( the middle of the ocean ) and see it for ourselves			0
the @entity32 is located at a natural collecting point at the center of a set of revolving currents called the @entity63			1
the middle of the @entity63 is more of a meteorological phenomenon than an actual place : a consistent high - pressure zone north of the @entity68 that , combined with the extremely weak currents , helps keep the ocean surface as placid as lake water			1
@entity72 has been sucked into this area from the encircling currents for as long as the @entity25 's existed , but up until the last century this process ended with the refuse safely biodegrading and being reabsorbed into the food chain as nutrients			1
with the advent of plastics , however , the @entity32 has transformed from a fertile feeding ground to the oceanic equivalent of a desert			0
and a particularly crap - strewn desert at that			1
see the rest of toxic : @entity88 we chartered a trip through the middle of the mess with capt. @entity93 of the @entity94			0
capt. @entity93 is credited with discovering the @entity32 in its present , trash - choked state , and at the time was one of the few people studying the extent and effect of the pollution			1
our voyage into the center of the @entity63 took eight days of round - the - clock sailing on a 50 - foot catamaran with a crew of six ( including @entity9 's three - man filming team )			1
by the time we got to the beginning of the patch , anticipation and cabin fever had conspired to make our expectations of " @entity88 " unreasonably high , but what we found still managed to surpass them			1
to the naked eye it looked no different from any other part of the ocean , except that every few minutes something really strange would float by			0
for instance , one time it was a hard hat with @entity127 writing on it			0
another time it was a motorcycle tire			0
another time it was a child 's life preserver with a cartoonish shark bite taken out of the side			0
once it was an enormous telephone - pole - shaped thing that could have easily wrecked our ship if we 'd been on a slightly different course			2
here we were in one of the most remote stretches of water in the world -- thousands of miles from land , had n't seen another ship in days -- and everywhere around us was civilization 's detritus			2
it would have been some consolation to think that the @entity32 was simply the result of careless sailors , but researchers estimate up to 80 percent of the trash originates on land			2
that not only meant that the shampoo bottle or birthday balloon we scooped up had most likely spent years traveling around the currents of the @entity158 before ending up in our path , but that there were countless others in the middle of the same journey			0
it was a colossal bring - down			2
then we started taking some samples of the water , and that 's when we realized things were even worse than we thought			1
watch what the water samples showed			2

@entity9 travels to a spot in the @entity25 where a massive pool of trash *churns* with the current
*non-biodegradable* bits of plastic make up much of the so - called " *chemical* soup "
@entity9 reporter says water sample tests were " worse than we thought "
