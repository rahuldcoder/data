-- just did some power lunges			2
can only speak in fragments			2
because my quads are so huge			2
your favorite part of working out is actually telling people that you just worked out , especially when you can filter this information into a completely unrelated conversation			2
" dude , earlier today i swear i saw a pigeon eating a pigeon			2
happened right when i got out of the gym ... that 's where i exercise			2
" deep down , for some reason , you just want people to know that your morning was spent inside a weight room , sweating , as opposed to , say , inside a bathroom , thumbing through an old @entity26 book			0
of course , some people do n't even try to be coy about their workout brags			1
instead , they flat out share their stats and results with the world via social media			0
and it 's the worst			0
" just biked 70 miles			0
" this is unacceptable behavior , and it needs to stop			0
i would do something about it , myself , but i 've got a big run coming up			0
however , in @entity44 , there 's a perfectly good reason for working out in public and letting everyone know without having to be one of those people			1
because at the @entity51 subway station , riders can now perform 30 squats in exchange for a free metro ticket			1
it 's all a part of a promotion for the upcoming @entity57 in @entity58 , and the @entity59 is hoping to " add elements of sport into daily life			0
" though , to be fair , this was accomplished many years ago when the two - piece track suit legally became the country 's official outfit for business casual			0
to earn the free metro ticket , which costs about $ 0.92 @entity69 , commuters have two minutes to complete their squats in front of the ticket machine 's special counting camera			1
but you have to do all 30			1
otherwise , a bear crawls out of the machine and mauls you			1
in @entity78 , failure has consequences			0
but , really , if you fail to do all 30 , you just have to pay for your ticket			1
there 's no reward for participation			0
and squats are no easy task			1
right now i 'm in week four of the insanity home workout program -- see how i slipped that in there ? -- and it 's basically 40 minutes of squats , broken up by short moments of lashing out with profanities toward @entity93 and @entity94			1
i cry during the 30 - second rest breaks , and check my e-mail during level 1 drills			1
because ai n't nobody got time for that			1
the point is that squats are hard , and the following activities may prove to be far more satisfying : 1 ) sleeping 2 ) eating 3 ) being trapped in a car fire regardless , the squat machine in @entity44 will remain at the station until the beginning of december , and the @entity59 is planning more chances for people to get fit in public with exercise bikes that charge your phone and bus handles converted into stretchy exercise bands			1
so , remember @entity116 , drink your recovery fluid and log onto @entity120 dot com			0
and good luck with that bear			0
follow @ @entity123 on @entity124 .			0

in @entity44 , metro riders can trade 30 squats for a free ticket
machine registers their movements
if they do n't do all 30 , they have to pay up
the ticket would cost the equivalent of about 92 cents
