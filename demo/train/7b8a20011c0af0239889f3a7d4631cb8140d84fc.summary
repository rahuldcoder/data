@entity0 -- the national trauma inflicted by the massacre of 20 children and six adults at @entity6 prompted an emotional and fierce debate on gun control , but the drive this spring for stricter limits led by president @entity11 fell short in @entity0			1
by summer , the issue had mostly faded on the political stage			2
it was replaced by troubling disclosures around national security leaks and @entity18 surveillance , violent political turmoil in @entity20 , alleged chemical weapons use in @entity22 , and another looming federal budget showdown			2
then , an armed , 34 - year - old former veteran shattered the late summer calm on monday when he shot up the @entity26 , killing 12 people before , he , too , died			1
headlines blared , first responders acted heroically , accounts of harrowing escape and sudden death filled the airwaves yet again in the @entity18			2
another mass shooting , said the president , another test of the national psyche			1
and , yes , a new call for tougher gun control			0
" when will enough be enough ? " sen. @entity40 , @entity41 , said @entity43 are " becoming far too familiar with senseless , tragic violence " and " these repeated incidents demand our attention			0
" " @entity47 needs to act , " rep. @entity46 said			2
but if the jolt delivered by the @entity6 massacre last december in a first grade classroom could n't serve as a catalyst in @entity47 for more extensive background checks than why would this latest incident move the debate beyond rhetoric ? initial indications are it wo n't even though a dozen people were slaughtered in the shadow of the @entity60			1
sen. @entity61 , @entity41 , is still seeking the five votes needed to pass the expanded background check measure that failed last spring			0
but he told @entity1 's @entity64 he did n't believe the shooting will impact legislation			2
but the @entity67 argued the @entity26 shooting was one more example of the failure of @entity0 to address the issue			1
" while it is too early to know what policies might have prevented this latest tragedy , we do know that policies that present a real opportunity to save lives sit stalled in @entity47 , policies that could prevent many of the dozens of deaths that result every day from gun violence , " @entity72 , the group 's president , said in a statement monday			2
did @entity11 strike the wrong tone on monday ? a more restrained response @entity11 , who wiped away tears on the day of @entity6 , briefly nodded monday to the seemingly growing trend of such tragedies			1
" so we are confronting yet another mass shooting , " he said			2
" and today , it happened on a military installation in our nation 's capital			0
" asked about the difference in his public reaction , @entity99 spokesman @entity98 said tuesday the president was " horrified " by the @entity26 killings			1
" while it is a sad truth we in @entity18 seem to experience these mass shootings with all too much frequency , they are always horrifying , " @entity98 said , adding that @entity6 presented its own particular horror because most of the victims were so young			1
sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , pointed to the @entity114 background check proposal , but stopped short of re-introducing the legislation			0
rep. @entity116 , the no. 2 @entity117 in the @entity99 , believes the @entity26 shooting will revive the debate , but argued outside groups opposed to any new restrictions make it unlikely that @entity47 will enact any new laws			1
" if the past is prologue that prologue is not very helpful , " @entity116 told reporters on tuesday			0
@entity128 , husband of former rep. @entity129 , released a statement offering support to the victims ' families , but did not make any calls for legislative action			2
however , he made sure to mention the context of the latest killings , saying they workers at the @entity26 were not killed overseas but in " a mass shooting here at home			1
" @entity129 was severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting that left six dead and 12 others injured @entity145 , an adjunct professor at the @entity147 's law school , said he doubts the latest shooting will fire up @entity0 the same way @entity6 did			1
until december , @entity11 had largely stayed away from gun control , so his decision to lay out a series of proposals for the first time certainly fueled the @entity156 debate , @entity145 noted			0
" but you can only do that once , " he said			0
opinion : gun control is not the answer a potential opening sen. @entity163 -- @entity164 , @entity165 -- said he believes the @entity26 shooting makes a case for a stronger push on mental health			1
the shooter , @entity171 , had recently made contact with two @entity174 hospitals for apparent psychological issues and had exhibited signs of mental problems , @entity1 has learned			2
his father said he suffered from post traumatic stress after working in 9/11 rescue efforts			0
" let us make mental health initiative a centerpiece of this renewal and reinvigoration of our effort to stop gun violence			1
let us combine it with background checks and other commonsense measures , " @entity163 said on the @entity114 floor			0
@entity61 agreed a mental health component could help nudge gun violence legislation forward			1
" i 'll support anything i can to rehabilitate people but also making sure people who are not rehabilitated should not be able to -- because of their past and their record -- not be able to purchase a gun , " he told reporters tuesday on @entity195			0
rev. @entity202 , a @entity203 pastor and gun rights activist , encouraged a societal change on mental health issues rather than a " microwave change " through gun control			1
" we failed him somewhere			0
nobody wants to put the finger on ourselves , but it 's us			0
we 're our own worst enemies , " he said			0
audit : big problems with @entity26 program that screens contractors other factors at play the powerful @entity221 has not weighed in on the latest shooting , but the organization tends to wait a short period of time after an incident before commenting			1
it 's entirely plausible that the tone of the debate remains less - than - fiery as the country still processes the events that took place monday			0
but there may also be an elephant in the room			0
last week , two state senators in @entity236 were booted out of office after voting in favor of the state 's new gun control laws			0
the @entity26 shooting represents the first national test of whether the recalls might have an impact on how @entity0 lawmakers react to the gun control , especially with the entire @entity99 and a third of the @entity114 facing reelection next year			1
" ( the recalls ) suggest to a lot of swing elected officials , who maybe do n't have deep convictions one way or the other on the gun issue , that banning arms as some sort of symbolic reaction to a crime by a mentally ill evildoer is not as politically popular , " said @entity145 , who also works as a research director of the @entity250 , a conservative think tank in @entity236			2
the most recent polling , however , indicates just over half of @entity18 nationwide think gun control laws should be stricter			0
according to a @entity267 / @entity266 from early june , 51 % of @entity18 favor stricter regulations , while 47 % prefer laws are kept as they are or become less strict			0
numbers in favor of tighter gun laws have dropped since the days following the @entity6 shooting			1
@entity274 , director of the @entity276 - backed group @entity275 , thinks the @entity26 shooting will have an impact on the larger debate , even if the effects are n't immediate			1
" it is the @entity282 water torture of a series of mass shootings that are happening more rapidly and are growing more deadly , " he said			1
his group will hold a previously scheduled rally thursday on @entity195 , with protests specifically aimed at senators who voted against the background check proposal			0
@entity1 's @entity64 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0

the immediate reaction to the @entity26 shooting seems more restrained than after @entity6
while some lawmakers are still calling on @entity47 to do something , other say action is doubtful
some argue mental health may be the next legislative path
others say @entity26 adds to growing sense mass shootings are growing worse and more frequent
