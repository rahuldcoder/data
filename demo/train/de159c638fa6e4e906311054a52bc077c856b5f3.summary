with the exception of toilet paper , low - cost airlines have managed to tack a fee on pretty much every formerly complimentary amenity			2
checked luggage , of course , was among the first to earn a price tag			2
@entity9 airlines such as @entity10 and @entity11 are already charging passengers extra for carry - ons			1
word has it other airlines will soon follow suit			0
airlines sugarcoat these bitter pills with explanations that sound pretty good			0
" @entity18 empowers customers to save money on air travel by offering ultra low base fares with a range of optional services , allowing customers the freedom to choose only the extras they value , " says @entity18			2
but c'mon -- who does n't value a bag ? if someone is going by plane , presumably they 're going away for at least a night			0
and presumably they 're going to want to put on a new pair of clothes			0
a fresh pair of underwear , at the very least			0
to the rescue of those of us sick of paying baggage fees comes @entity45 , a company with an innovative way to pull one over on " the man " -- wearable luggage			1
" only fools pay for extra luggage , " reads the company 's tagline			1
" clever people have a @entity45			1
" what is a @entity45 , you ask ? it 's a bag that unfolds into a jacket that 's covered in various - sized pockets , allowing travelers to pack everything into their coats			1
there are a few other " luggage jackets " on the market -- @entity69 , @entity70 , etc -- but @entity45 appears to be the leader in capacity			1
the makers say it 's also a handy way to carry things when you 've run out of suitcase space			2
the wearable bags come in a variety of styles and materials like leather and denim			2
there 's a dress version			0
prices range from $ 90 - 319			1
@entity89 in mind , you 're going to have to sacrifice style in the name of savings			0
the @entity45 is n't sexy			1
and we ca n't imagine they 're comfortable			0
but hey , you already gave up everything else for that cheap flight			0
might as well chuck your dignity into the low - cost turbines too			0
would you slap on a @entity45 if it meant avoiding luggage fees ? share your thoughts below .			1
