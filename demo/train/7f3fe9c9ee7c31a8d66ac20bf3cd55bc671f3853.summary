the middle - aged man stands in line , patiently waiting			1
he 's wearing the de facto uniform of the @entity4 businessman , a fitted black suit and thin tie			1
he 's driven an hour to be here at the memorial site at @entity9 , joining the 100,000 mourners paying their respects before the school portraits of children who will never grow old			1
" i 'm a father of two kids , " he weeps , his hand firmly over his chest , as if to press in a breaking heart			1
" i just am very sorry because i can do nothing for these families			1
i just want to come here to say i 'm very sorry to these families			1
" he knew no one aboard the @entity23 ferry -- his life in @entity4 should be blissfully separate from the unfolding disaster at sea			1
but he embodies the grief , guilt and anger that leaves virtually no one in @entity31 untouched			1
nation in yellow the main road into @entity35 is lined with yellow			1
every 6 feet , another yellow ribbon waves in the wind of the passing cars			1
at @entity40 in @entity9 , where the junior class lost three quarters of its students in the ferry disaster , yellow ribbons are tied at the gates			1
but these ribbons did n't start at the disaster site or the school			1
in the nation that refers to itself as the most wired in the world , @entity31 's ribbons began online , as a simple yellow square with the outline of a bow			1
@entity56 students designed the image and began to spread it on an instant messaging site in @entity31 called @entity60 on april 19			1
the meaning began as a hopeful one , " one small step , big miracle			1
" as the death toll continues to rise , it 's evolved into a national sign of grief			1
people are tying ribbons to their homes and schools across the country			1
the ribbons prominently appear on television news programs nearly every half hour , somber music sometimes playing underneath the slow - motion images of the yellow across the country			1
the prim presenters of @entity31 's television programs , whose female anchors tend to favor hot pink and royal blue , are all wearing grey and black suits			1
one story dominates the news channels -- the @entity23 ferry disaster , from the investigation to the national mourning			1
on @entity31 language @entity92 and @entity94 , users share their grief in short messages with a yellow ribbon			1
overwhelmingly , the messages tend to focus on a sense of rage and helplessness			2
" i am sorry that i could n't rescue you and help you , " @entity92 user @ sbja22 wrote			2
children , a nation 's treasure the palpable desire to rescue the victims centers around who the passengers are -- students from @entity40			2
juniors in @entity31 's high schools have traditionally been granted a special outing or field trip before notoriously rigorous college entrance exams			2
the teenagers who boarded the @entity23 ferry were experiencing a national rite of passage that turned to horror			2
children in @entity31 are considered a family 's treasure , the ones who have traditionally been doted on and showered with attention			2
obedience in the young is prized			2
parental protection is the reward			2
the @entity23 disaster tears through much of the cultural structure expected in modern @entity31 society of children and elders			1
the first emergency call from the doomed ferry came from a @entity138 student , 17 - year - old @entity139 - ha			2
we are on a ship , and i think it 's sinking , " he pleaded as he called emergency services			2
the adults on the ship failed to make the first distress call and would follow three minutes later			2
@entity148 would die on the @entity23 ferry			2
the crew , the ones trained to protect the passengers , issued a ship - wide announcement for passengers to remain in their cabins , instead of heading to the deck and the life rafts			2
the high school students , raised in that culture of obedience , overwhelmingly listened to that announcement			2
survivors say the passengers who listened to that order were the ones who never made it off			0
the crew then abandoned ship , being some of the first rescued by the coast guard			0
television news broadcast images fueling national outrage -- the captain jumping into a rescue boat as his young passengers remained trapped , wearing life vests that prevented them from swimming out of flooding rooms			0
systemwide failure the @entity23 ferry was first known as the @entity180 , built in @entity181			0
it operated in @entity181 from 1994 to 2012			0
the @entity183 purchased the ferry on october 2012 and refurbished it			0
@entity185 added extra passenger cabins on the third , fourth and fifth decks , raising passenger capacity and altering the weight and balance of the vessel			0
the ferry , renamed the @entity23 , went through regulatory and safety checks , conducted by the @entity195			0
on its website , it lists its mission as " protecting life and property			0
" the organization says it has the ability to inspect vessels in 65 nations , from @entity204 to @entity205			0
the organization is private but works on behalf of the government			0
in the case of the @entity23 , the @entity195 conducted safety inspections , investigating its design and technology			0
the @entity23 's modifications passed inspection and began sailing with passengers last year , operating between @entity215 and the resort island of @entity217			0
" the modification was part of the reason for the ( @entity23 ) accident , " believes @entity218 , a marine science and technology professor at @entity56 who has studied maritime accidents , including a similar ferry disaster in @entity181 in 2007			1
" they bought a used vessel from @entity181 and added lots of cabins , and these cabins were built on the top part of the ship			0
it shifted the center of gravity upward			0
" in the wake of the @entity23 sinking , @entity235 prosecutors have raided the @entity183 and the @entity195			0
prosecutors tell @entity238 while they will not have a conclusion on what caused the accident for months , they are focusing on the retrofit of the @entity23 and the shifting and overloading of cargo			0
the prosecutor 's office also says the @entity247 found serious safety failures on a sister ship , the @entity250 , also owned by the @entity251 found of the life rafts on board the @entity250 , 40 did not work			0
the emergency slides also did not work			0
the @entity255 did not have any equipment to tie down cars being ferried on board			0
shipping containers being transported did have equipment to tie them down , but it did not work very well			0
@entity31 's @entity263 says the @entity255 ceased operations after the @entity23 accident			0
the sense of failure to protect the passengers extends to the @entity269 and its rescue of the passengers who did make it to the upper decks of the @entity23			0
television images showed the coast guard pulling crew members to safety , while the ferry bobbed on its side			0
as @entity282 look inward on this disaster , the sinking of the ferry is being viewed as an outrageous system failure , from the company that sought to increase passenger loads to the very government charged with protecting the passengers			1
" it makes us wonder if we have to take charge of our own safety , " says @entity288 , assistant professor at @entity289			0
" we ca n't take it for granted that there are proper government safeguards or proper inspections of safety requirements in place to protect us			0
i think the @entity23 is a classic case of corruption or collusion between government agencies , associations and corporations			0
and it 's something that as a nation we must try to fix			0
" the funerals are well underway , the school pictures of teenagers and teachers being broadcast on television and the web part of the nation 's mourning process			1
but there is another call beyond the cries of grief , an inward alarm to repair the flaws and prevent another disaster with such an immense loss			1
@entity31 prime minister resigns over ferry disaster response @entity31 mourn teen hero who made first emergency call from ferry			1

*thousands* pay their respects at a memorial in @entity9
even those without a connection to the disaster are *heartbroken*
yellow ribbons have become a *symbol* of mourning
