@entity3 magazine apologized friday for discrepancies in an article about the alleged gang rape of a @entity8 student , after friends of the victim expressed doubts about the woman 's account and the accused fraternity chapter denied key details			1
@entity3 editors had chosen not to contact the man who allegedly " orchestrated the attack on ' @entity17 ' ( the woman who was the subject of the article ) nor any of the men she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her , " a decision the magazine says it now regrets			2
" in the face of new information , there now appear to be discrepancies in @entity17 's account , and we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her was misplaced , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 managing editor @entity35 later tweeted that " the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story			1
" @entity8 pledges zero - tolerance in rape cases the article chronicled the school 's failure to respond to that alleged assault			1
it prompted an emergency meeting by the school 's governing board and the announcement of a zero - tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases			1
according to the magazine , @entity17 , who at the time had just started her freshman year at the @entity55 school , claimed she was raped by seven men at @entity59 fraternity , while two more gave encouragement , during a party			2
however , the @entity8 's @entity59 chapter did not have a party the night of september 28 , 2012 , the date when the alleged attack occurred , or at all that weekend , the chapter said in a statement friday			1
the chapter 's lawyer , @entity68 , told @entity70 email and fraternity records are proof			2
@entity68 said there were other discrepancies in the accuser 's account			2
for example , the accused orchestrator of the alleged rape did not belong to the fraternity , the fraternity house has no side staircase , and there were no pledges at that time of year			0
@entity17 told the magazine she hurried out a side staircase after the incident and said her attackers egged each other on , asking , " do n't you want to be a brother ? " " it 's not part of our culture , " @entity68 said			0
" it 's just not true			0
" @entity17 also described her alleged attacker as a fellow lifeguard at the university pool			0
the fraternity 's @entity8 chapter said an internal investigation found no member who worked at the @entity104 at the time of the alleged attack			1
" we have no knowledge of these alleged acts being committed at our house or by our members , " the chapter statement said			0
" anyone who commits any form of sexual assault , wherever or whenever , should be identified and brought to justice			1
" members of the fraternity were contacted by the author of the @entity3 article but provided no information " because they had none to provide , " fraternity spokeswoman @entity117 said in a statement			2
she said the members were shocked and surprised by the allegations , and that they were never contacted by fact - checkers at the magazine			1
the chapter said it is working with the @entity131 as it investigates the allegations			0
the @entity133 reported friday that a group of @entity17 's close friends " believe something traumatic happened to her , but they also have come to doubt her account " because details have changed over time			2
@entity17 stands by her story , the @entity133 also reported			0
" i never asked for this " attention , @entity17 told the newspaper			0
" what bothers me is that so many people act like it did n't happen			0
i have had to live with the fact that it happened every day for the last two years			0
" @entity3 's scathing report , detailing not just @entity17 's graphic allegation of being raped and brutalized at a fraternity party , but also @entity8 's supposed indifference to victims of sexual assault , stirred a firestorm on the campus			1
at a recent emergency meeting of @entity8 's governing board , @entity159 @entity158 said , " to @entity17 and her parents , i say i am sorry			1
to the survivors of sexual assault and their families , i am also sorry			2
" the board unanimously adopted a resolution affirming a zero - tolerance approach toward rape and sexual assault cases , though what exactly that means remains to be seen			1
" this type of conduct will not be tolerated at the @entity8 , " @entity158 said			2
" the status quo is no longer acceptable			0
" in the wake of the @entity3 article 's publication , @entity8 also suspended all fraternities ' activities until after the winter break			1
the university 's president said in a statement friday that doubts about the story " must not alter " its focus on the issue of sexual violence on college campuses			1
@entity192 said the school " will continue to take a hard look at our practices , policies and procedures , and continue to dedicate ourselves to becoming a model institution in our educational programming , in the character of our student culture , and in our care for those who are victims			0
" @entity35 , the magazine 's managing editor , wrote on @entity207 that he ca n't explain the discrepancies between @entity17 's account and the chapter 's statements			1
" the fact that there is a story that appears in @entity3 in which i do n't have complete confidence is deeply unsettling to me , " he wrote			1
" we made a judgment -- the kind of judgement ( sic ) reporters and editors make every day			0
and in this case , our judgement was wrong			0
" we should have either not made this agreement with @entity17 ... or worked harder to convince her that the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story			0
that failure is on us -- not her			0
" @entity133 media critic @entity229 , who wrote a blog post earlier this week examining problems with @entity3 's reporting , criticized reporter @entity234 's failure to seek comment from the accused			1
" they 're threading this whole thing through one voice , " @entity229 told @entity70 on friday			0
" this is what we call journalistic malpractice			0
... it 's really outrageous that @entity3 would have done this			2
" @entity245 , a student reporter at @entity246 , said the article emboldened women to come forward with stories of sexual assault , and that may stop following the magazine 's apology			1
" i 'm worried that girls are not going to report now out of fear of being called liars , " @entity245 told @entity70 .			0

@entity258 says they were never contacted by @entity3 fact - checkers
@entity3 's managing editor says the discrepancies are " deeply unsettling "
@entity8 's president says the doubts must not alter its focus on sexual assault issues
