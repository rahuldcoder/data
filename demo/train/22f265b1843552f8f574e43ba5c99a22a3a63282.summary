-- two former @entity2 champions face off thursday in @entity3 , but neither @entity4 nor @entity5 have been in dominant form lately			1
they both lost their first matches this year and will be hungry for a win to keep hopes alive of advancing to the knockout round of the competition			0
@entity4 , the 1966 champions , have lost their last two @entity2 matches			1
@entity5 , who have won the @entity2 twice , have lost their last three matches			2

@entity65 of @entity66 and @entity67 of @entity68 are the others			0
