a prominent human rights activist whose 18 - month house arrest in eastern @entity3 and dramatic escape attracted worldwide attention is in the @entity6 in @entity7 , a close friend said saturday			1
" when @entity12 first fled to @entity7 , we had to keep moving him from place to place to ensure his safety -- and we agreed the @entity6 @entity6 is the only absolutely secure location in town , " said @entity8 , a fellow activist and one of the few people who 've seen him since he arrived in the capital			1
" i understand he 's now in a 100 % safe place and that place is the @entity6 embassy			1
" quoting an anonymous source , @entity21 - based nonprofit group @entity20 said @entity12 is " under @entity6 protection and high - level talks are currently under way between @entity6 and @entity3 officials regarding his status			1
" " because of @entity12 's wide popularity , the @entity31 administration must stand firmly with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the rule of law , " said @entity29 , the head of @entity20			2
a @entity6 @entity6 spokesman and @entity3 officials declined to answer questions about @entity12			1
@entity6 secretary of state @entity40 is scheduled to arrive in @entity7 next week for talks with @entity3 officials on strategic and economic issues			1
the activist , who is blind , was driven to @entity7 on sunday after evading his guards in a tiny village in @entity46 , according to @entity47 , a friend and fellow activist			1
@entity12 addressed @entity3 premier @entity49 in a video posted on @entity51 on friday , detailing " cruel " abuses he said he and his family suffered at the hands of authorities during more than 18 months of heavily guarded detention in their home			1
" they broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife , " he said			2
" they pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter , beating and kicking her for hours			0
they also similarly violently assaulted me			0
" journalists and supporters were prevented from visiting @entity12 during his house arrest			1
one of those supporters is @entity73 actor @entity72 , who was roughed up by security guards during such an attempt in december			2
after learning of @entity12 's escape , @entity72 urged @entity3 to free his family , who were also under house arrest but did not escape with him			1
" while it gives hope that , for now , @entity12 is safe , his family is not , " @entity72 said in an e-mail to @entity79 saturday			2
" as a world leader , @entity3 must now show its wisdom and compassion , and remind the world of its rich cultural history , by permanently freeing @entity12 and his family and never allowing thuggery and corruption to tarnish @entity3 's reputation again			1
" @entity12 , 40 , is a self - taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices , such as alleged forced abortions , by @entity3 's family - planning officials			1
a local court sentenced @entity12 to four years and three months in prison in 2006 on charges of damaging property and " organizing a mob to disturb traffic " in a protest , charges that his supporters called preposterous			2
since his september 2010 release from prison , he had been confined to his home along with his wife , mother and daughter			0
according to he , @entity12 's friend , @entity12 prepared for his escape for months by lying in bed for long periods so guards would n't be suspicious if they did n't see any activity from him for a long time			1
fellow activist @entity8 said @entity12 scaled a high wall at night and hurt his leg after jumping off			1
" he stumbled and fell hundreds of times , and crossed a muddy creek -- it took him hours to evade layers of security , " @entity8 told @entity79 by phone			0
" as a blind man , his other senses are heightened , " he added			0
" to him , night means nothing and darkness is protection			0
" @entity8 , himself released from prison last june after serving 3 1/2 years for " inciting to subvert state power , " has known @entity12 since 2001			2
his wife posted a photo online of the men 's reunion at an undisclosed location , showing both sporting black jackets and wide grins			0
" he called me ' brother , brother , ' and gave me a big hug , " @entity8 said			0
" he has a lot more gray hair and is sick , but his spirits are high			0
" @entity12 's high - profile breakout appears to have angered the local officials who were holding him captive , with supporters saying at least four members of his family already detained			1
in the friday video , the blind activist appealed to the @entity3 premier to investigate his case and expressed concern about the welfare of his wife , mother and daughter			1
their whereabouts were unknown saturday			0
" although i 'm free , my worries are only deepening , " he said			0
" they have been persecuting my family for a long time , and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge			0
" @entity170 @entity172 @entity171 echoed those sentiments , saying in a statement released friday that she is " disturbed to hear reports that other family members ... have now been detained			0
" noting she has raised concerns about @entity12 's case before , @entity171 urged @entity3 authorities " to investigate the treatment of both him and his family , to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials			1
" repeated calls seeking comment from the local authorities in @entity46 went unanswered			0
the authorities ' reaction also seems to have ensnared @entity12 's supporters , especially those suspected in helping him escape			2
after speaking to @entity79 , @entity8 was taken away by police for questioning , his wife posted on @entity198			0
@entity12 's friend he disappeared friday , shortly after @entity79 interviewed her via @entity200			2
the last message she sent out , said @entity203 , was that state security agents had arrived at her home in the eastern city of @entity208			0
" i 'm not concerned about my own safety , " she said during the interview			0
" i hope they 'll arrest me , not my friends			0
