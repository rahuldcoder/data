-- the fall of dictatorships does not guarantee the creation of free societies			2
there is often a period in which we witness the legacy of tyranny			0
the @entity11 uprisings have overthrown tyrants in @entity13 and @entity14 , but the populations and lawmakers have yet to grasp that democracy is not only about free elections but creating free societies			1
when sexual harassment of women increases on the streets of @entity13 , when centuries - old shrines of @entity24 saints are destroyed with explosives in @entity14 , when screenings of films such as " @entity33 " trigger riots in @entity29 and @entity31 minorities across the @entity32 feel under siege , then we must stop pretending that all is well with the @entity36			0
but all is not lost either			0
@entity11 societies are on a journey			1
they can easily take the wrong turn			0
the attacks on the @entity44 embassies in @entity14 , @entity13 and @entity45 are examples of the ongoing presence of intolerant , tyrannical actors in @entity11 societies			1
these are people who were born and raised in dictatorships			1
they are accustomed to thinking that a government controls its citizens -- that a film or documentary can not be produced without government approval			2
for decades , this has been the reality of their lives , and they strongly believe that the western world and its citizens have a similarly controlling relationship between individuals and government			2
in light of this assumption , they hold the @entity44 government responsible for the tacky and distasteful film produced by a right - wing @entity69			0
news : who is responsible for film at the heart of protests ? little wonder , then , that @entity13 president @entity75 has called for the prosecution by the @entity44 government of the filmmakers , and @entity13 's top cleric , @entity80 , has called on the @entity81 to forbid denigration of faiths			2
@entity75 studied in the @entity44 and @entity80 regularly visits the @entity84 on the interfaith circuit , yet both men do n't yet grasp that religious freedom and the freedom of expression are inextricably linked in @entity44			1
it is hard for younger @entity11 not born into freedom to understand how individual liberty works in real life			1
the freedom to proselytize also guarantees the right to apostatize			0
heresy and blasphemy are essential parts of free and democratic societies			0
@entity11 activists can not seek to emulate the @entity84 's political and social achievements by looking at the @entity44 and @entity102 today , but must observe and learn from the religious battles of 17th - century @entity102 , the smashing of the tyranny of the @entity106 , the ending of burning witches and the forbidding of hanging heretics			1
it is this history of unbolting the doors of dissent that led to the conditions in which @entity115 and @entity116 could write and think freely and then influence @entity117 and the other @entity118			0
there are no shortcuts to freedom , except to learn from the mistakes of the @entity84 in the past			0
the @entity11 uprisings are not over yet			1
they are still unfolding and shaping the future			0
this culture of shouting and killing those with whom @entity24 disagree must end			0
when the @entity132 's companions shouted " @entity133 , " ( meaning " @entity137 is @entity138 , " a popular slogan for those yelling outside embassies today ) the prophet reprimanded them saying " our lord is not deaf			1
" @entity140 : extremists and leaders incite violent protests when a @entity145 @entity11 entered the most sacred mosque of the prophet in @entity148 and violated its sanctity by urinating in this place of divinity , the prophet cleansed the mosque himself and forbade anybody from even reprimanding the @entity145 , let alone attacking the man			1
this is the way of the @entity132			2
where is this spirit of mildness , forgiveness and compassion amid @entity162 activists today ? the millions of protestors last year in @entity11 capitals that chanted " hurriyah , karamah , adala ijtima'iyya " or " freedom , dignity and social justice " can not allow for the emotions of bigots to derail their revolution			1
freedom is not only about majority rule , but ensuring that women , religious minorities and intellectual dissenters are able to flourish without fear			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 : @entity11 uprisings have ousted tyrants , but citizens still do n't fully grasp democracy
he says intolerance can endure among people reared under dictatorships
he says they could learn from @entity102 's 17th century religious battles
@entity181 : @entity132 taught mildness , forgiveness . where is that amid @entity199 today ?
