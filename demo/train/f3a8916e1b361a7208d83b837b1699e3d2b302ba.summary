-- when @entity3 minister of defense @entity2 stated that the @entity3 troops along @entity1 's borders were only conducting " training exercises " and have no " intention to cross @entity1 's borders or to engage in any aggressive actions , " @entity1 rolled their eyes			1
and when president @entity11 told @entity1 " do n't believe those who terrify you with @entity3 , who shout that other regions will follow @entity15			1
we do not want @entity1 's division			2
... we want @entity1 to be a strong , sovereign , and self - sufficient state , " @entity1 shrugged			0
the problem is , even if @entity11 and @entity2 were being sincere , @entity18 has lost all credibility among most @entity1 and the international community			1
after three weeks of aggressive @entity3 behavior and the possibility of existential annihilation , @entity1 , like @entity24 , prefer to think in terms of worst - case scenarios			1
after all , they blithely assumed @entity3 would never attack -- and then @entity3 seized @entity15			0
they never imagined that @entity3 officials would treat their country as an object of abject scorn			0
they never suspected that thousands of @entity3 would chant anti-ukrainian war slogans in the streets of @entity18			2
in each instance , @entity1 ' working assumption of a friendly @entity3 proved dead wrong			2
they also never imagined that the @entity39 regime had so thoroughly permitted @entity1 's defensive capacity to deteriorate , by sacrificing @entity1 security on the altar of the @entity44 's untrammeled accumulation of power and embezzlement of state funds			2
a political scientist at @entity50 's elite @entity49 has stated that he is not " not optimistic about @entity1 maintaining the integrity of even its mainland territorial borders " until the end of march and has evacuated his family from the capital			2
a friend in @entity57 tells me that " an invasion and war are unavoidable			0
" an @entity62 businessman in @entity50 writes : " i believe we are closer to @entity64 than we have ever been			0
" in many parts of the country , @entity1 have taken to preparing little suitcases with all the necessities -- just in case they have to flee at a moment 's notice			2
@entity1 ' jitters are perfectly understandable			0
@entity1 officials say that 80,000 @entity3 troops and heavy armor are amassed on @entity1 's borders			1
@entity11 claims to have the right to intervene anywhere in @entity1 if and when he deems that @entity3 citizens are being threatened			1
he and myriad @entity3 policymakers routinely insist that @entity1 are really @entity3 and that @entity1 is an artificial entity			2
thus far , @entity18 refuses to recognize the democratic government in @entity50 and claims that it is no longer bound by the @entity84			0
because of @entity3 's occupation of @entity15 and @entity11 's militarist rhetoric , many @entity1 are certain that war is inevitable			1
prime minister @entity88 warned @entity18 on march 20 that @entity1 's response to a @entity3 invasion would be vigorous			1
@entity50 has already begun improving its defensive capabilities			0
on march 17 , the @entity92 allocated 6.9 billion hryvnia -- about $ 684 million -- to defense			0
in the last few weeks , @entity1 armed forces , tanks and other defensive weapons have been deployed along the country 's border with @entity3			1
the number of border guards along @entity1 's southeastern borders has also increased			2
kherson province is planning to build a 20 - kilometer long ditch along its border with @entity15			0
a @entity106 has been formed , and its ranks are to consist of 20,000 troops			0
the @entity109 appears also to have become more active in @entity1 's vulnerable southeastern provinces			2
no less important , the population is determined to resist and sales of guns have far outstripped supply			0
thinking in more long - term categories , former minister of foreign affairs @entity116 has even suggested that @entity1 exit the @entity117 and initiate the " process of uranium enrichment			0
" @entity62 provision of non-lethal military equipment and advisers would also go a long way to improving @entity1 's deterrent capacity			0
@entity50 's defensive efforts may or may not be enough to stop a possible @entity3 attack , but they would certainly make it far more difficult , risky , and bloody -- which may be enough to deter @entity18			0
alternatively , these efforts may just induce @entity3 to seek less frontal modes of undermining @entity1			2
after all , any potential @entity3 assault on mainland @entity1 would rest on three pillars : an invasion by the army , the agitation by @entity131 " fifth columns " within @entity1 , and the diversionary activities of @entity3 secret agents and special forces tasked with sowing panic , sabotaging transportation and communications , and attacking military bases and arms depots			2
although @entity1 appears to have the capacity to neutralize internal threats , a concerted long - term @entity3 effort at stoking instability could lay the groundwork for a later invasion or , at the very least , divert @entity50 's attention from the pressing cause of economic and political reform			1
while @entity1 's security may or may not be enhanced by most of these measures , the irony is that @entity3 's definitely will not be -- at least in the medium to long term			1
@entity11 's seizure of @entity15 may have provided him with the opportunity to beat his chest before adoring @entity3 crowds , but it will eventually undermine @entity3 security			1
@entity1 is and will remain too weak to be a threat			0
and on its own , no country in @entity3 's " near abroad " can pose a threat			1
even taken together , the non-russians will be weaker than @entity3			0
but @entity11 's land grab will make all of them inclined to regard @entity3 as a potentially land - grabbing foe and to promote their own security independently of @entity3 and outside of any @entity3 - led blocs or unions			1
expect the @entity173 and @entity174 to turn increasingly to @entity175 and @entity176 , and the @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity1 , and even the @entity179 to head for the @entity180			0
also expect the @entity3 's @entity182 autonomous republics and regions to press for greater autonomy from @entity18			1
if @entity11 could just put aside his hypernationalist neo-imperialism and think straight about what 's good for @entity3 , he 'd try to nip the problem in the bud			1
a sober @entity3 would then withdraw all the forces that are engaged in " exercises " along @entity1 's borders and agree to a significant force reduction in @entity15			1
a sober @entity3 would also explicitly state that it recognizes the @entity194 and the current @entity1 government			2
that last point is essential			0
as long as the @entity197 insists that the @entity50 government is illegitimate , it will always be able to claim that its behavior toward @entity1 's @entity3 minority is also illegitimate and , hence , liable to correction by means of @entity3 intervention			1
seen in this light , annexing @entity15 has to be one of @entity11 's worst strategic blunders			1
had the province become " independent , " there would still have been a theoretical possibility of finding some accommodation with @entity50			0
after annexation , any dialogue with the @entity1 government -- and , thus , any resolution of the @entity215 - @entity1 conflict -- becomes significantly more difficult			0
it 's perfectly possible that @entity11 wants the conflict to remain unresolved , on the assumption that it will undermine @entity1			1
the problem is that an unresolved conflict will also undermine @entity3			0
as @entity1 and @entity3 's other @entity182 neighbors are compelled by @entity18 's aggression to enhance their security , @entity3 may soon face a nightmare of its own creation -- non-russian encirclement			1
when @entity3 wake up to the reality after the euphoria of @entity15 's annexation wears off , @entity11 may very well discover that his own security and stability as president are in danger			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			0

@entity237 : @entity1 do n't believe @entity3 's assurances it will not invade
he says people are *buying* guns , leaving town , packing suitcases to be ready for war
@entity237 : @entity1 is *beefing* up its *decimated* defense ; sending troops , tanks to borders
@entity237 : this may be @entity11 's worst strategic move , *alienating* other small , nearby nations
