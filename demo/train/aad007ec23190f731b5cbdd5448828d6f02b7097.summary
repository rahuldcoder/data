did the @entity0 make $ 10.5 billion in 2013 , pay its chief executive @entity1 $ 44.2 million , yet pay no taxes to @entity3 ? well , yes and no. the @entity0 pays taxes through its various money - making offshoots such as @entity6 and @entity7 , but the league office in @entity9 , which paid @entity1 his very handsome salary , does n't			1
the reason goes back to 1942 when the @entity12 ruled the @entity0 was a trade association for its now 32 - member teams and therefore exempt from taxes as a nonprofit under section 501 ( c ) 6 of the tax code			1
just to be safe , the @entity0 lobbied @entity19 in 1966 on the eve of its merger with the @entity22			1
two powerful @entity24 politicians , sen. @entity25 and rep. @entity26 , wanted a football team in @entity28			0
then - @entity0 commissioner @entity29 wanted antitrust protection and confirmed tax - exempted status for the league office			1
the @entity33 were born in @entity28 and in exchange , @entity29 got his wish slipped into an unrelated federal bill on investments and depreciation			0
sports attorney and expert on the @entity0 's tax exemption , @entity42 , told @entity43 , " @entity29 was a forward - looking guy , i ca n't imagine what those two lines ( of text ) , maybe three is worth today			1
" millions , it turns out , according to sen. @entity48 , an @entity50 @entity49 who wants the tax - exemption for professional sports teams gone			0
for all the professional sports leagues -- including the @entity56 and @entity57 among others -- that use the loophole , " it amounts to like $ 10 million a year			0
$ 10 or 11 million a year			0
probably $ 110 million over the next 10 years			0
but the point is why should they have that ? " @entity48 told @entity43			0
@entity48 has introduced the @entity63 to strip the @entity0 and others of the decades - old exemption			1
what the @entity0 pays -- and does n't -- in taxes according to @entity0 spokesman @entity75 , " every dollar of income that is earned in the @entity0 -- from game tickets , television rights fees , jersey sales and national sponsorships -- is subject to tax			1
none of this income is shielded in a tax - exempt entity			0
instead , the @entity0 's 32 clubs pay tax on all of these revenues			1
" but that 's not 100 % true , @entity48 said			0
" the individual owners and teams pay taxes			1
we 're not going after them , but what they do is they can put all this confluence of money into the league office and do this as a nonprofit , which means they 're not paying taxes like every other business that would be in a trade business like they are , " @entity48 said			1
the nonprofit @entity0 raked in more than $ 326 million from april 2012 to march 2013 , almost of all of which came from " membership dues and assessments " or league fees paid by the member teams , according to a @entity43 analysis of @entity12 documents			1
those dues are tax deductible for the teams as " business expenses " according to the @entity12			1
@entity111 thinks the @entity0 calling itself a nonprofit is too much			2
" i do n't think anything they are doing is illegal , but it is not in the spirit of a nonprofit , nonprofits do n't have directors with salaries north of 40 million , " he said			0
" it 's a business , and they should call it that			0
" @entity1 's salary , which comes from the @entity0 's nonprofit arm , rivals some of the top - paid ceos in the corporate world			1
@entity1 's compensation would rank in the top 20 for @entity125 of @entity129 public companies and above the leaders of @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , according to a chart of total compensation compiled by the @entity136			2
@entity0 's team in @entity19 @entity139 owner @entity138 may lead @entity19 's on - the - field franchise , but former @entity142 adviser @entity141 just recently became the new team captain of the @entity0 's real powerhouse squad : its lobbyists			1
according to a @entity43 analysis , the @entity0 employed 20 lobbyists in 2014 and spent more than $ 1 million in efforts to sway lawmakers			2
in a swanky building just blocks down @entity150 from the @entity151 , the @entity0 employs six lobbyists , including four on its own payroll			2
the other two come from powerhouse law and lobbying firm @entity156 and @entity157 , which also employs former @entity0 commissioner @entity158			1
@entity158 is not a registered lobbyist as of this writing , instead he " uses his experience as chief executive and board member of the @entity0 , major businesses and nonprofits to advise clients on matters of organizational structure and governance , develop strategic risk mitigation approaches and assist in managing unfolding crises			2
" @entity173 , executive director of the @entity174 , which runs the transparency website @entity174 , says the @entity0 's lobbying team is " all pro , " and almost all are " former government employees , former @entity178 staffers			2
so they have good access by buying the help of people who know how to navigate @entity182			0
" nineteen of the 20 worked for @entity182 , largely in the offices of @entity151 and @entity186 leaders , according to a @entity43 review of lobbying disclosures			0
the @entity0 even paid another influential lobby shop , @entity190 @entity192 , to lobby against @entity48 's bill , which thus far has been benched -- referred to the @entity193 with no action expected anytime soon			1
but that may be changing			0
both sen. @entity196 , a @entity198 @entity197 , and sen. @entity199 , a @entity19 @entity197 , have introduced bills similar to @entity48 's legislation			2
@entity196 wants the tax money to go to preventing domestic violence			0
@entity199 wants the @entity0 to scrap the @entity139 moniker			2
if the @entity0 were to lose its tax exemption , there 's precedence for it			0
@entity208 gave up its nonprofit status in 2007 , and the @entity210 never had one .			0

the @entity0 has for - profit business , but the league office is *technically* a trade association
therefore , it pays no taxes and owners can deduct the dues they pay
commissioner @entity1 makes as much as some of the *highest* paid ceos
some in @entity19 are trying to change the law while others lobby against it
