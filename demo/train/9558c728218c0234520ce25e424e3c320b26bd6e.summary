@entity1 -- " big brother is watching you			0
" this is the sinister maxim repeated throughout @entity6 's " @entity5 , " his dark portrayal of life inside an authoritarian state characterized by its omniscient and paranoid leadership			0
fortunately this kind of dystopian nightmare is confined to fiction for most of us -- or more recently the world of reality television with the phenomenally successful @entity18 show , where groups of hapless " housemates " try to outlast each in an isolated environment where their every move is monitored 24 hours a day			1
and now the show is coming to @entity25 's small screen , an irony that wo n't be lost on many in a country that purportedly has more people employed to censor the internet than its army ( the world 's largest ) has soldiers			1
launching in early 2015 , the first - ever @entity35 version of @entity18 will air for ten weeks , with production in @entity25 set to begin shortly , according to @entity25 -- part of the @entity39 arm of one of the world 's leading multi-platform program makers -- who will partner with @entity35 digital video platform @entity44 to produce the show			1
" in a market that annually generates hundreds of billions of video views , partnering with the number one digital video platform will allow us to bring @entity18 to a young audience and deliver the most immersive , interactive and unique experience to fans across the nation , " said @entity49 's ceo of @entity50			2
@entity60 , chairman and ceo of @entity44 said : " we are delighted to be joining forces with @entity49 to finally bring this groundbreaking format to @entity25			2

" ' excessive ' and ' vulgar ' the announcement comes at a time when authorities are concerned about the lack of originality and diversity of @entity35 programs , as well as " excessive " and " vulgar " entertainment -- with foreign content in their crosshairs			1
shows such as " @entity81 , " a talent show that replicates the formula of the hugely popular " american idol , " have been a huge success with viewers and sponsors alike			2
but as of this year , satellite broadcasters are only permitted to buy the rights to more than one foreign - made program per year			0
@entity18 , which has been running for 15 years , continues to be a hit in the @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , as well across @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity39 .			0

launching in early 2015 , the first - ever @entity35 version of @entity18 will air for ten weeks
