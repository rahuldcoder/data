-- @entity1 have learned a lot about @entity3 in this election cycle : we now know she has a drivers ' license , but feels too insecure to drive herself			1
she has confessed that in her youth she sometimes drank too much cherry wine and that she has been married once before and divorced			0
her current husband , @entity12 , a quantum chemist , often criticizes her for putting too few sprinkles on the cakes she bakes			0
he should know , since he is the son of a pastry chef			0

she believes in eternal love , and does n't like to @entity23			0
in recent months , @entity3 has shown the @entity1 voter that she is a real person , down - to - earth and approachable			1
but while some newspaper editorials have criticized the exposure of politicians ' personal lives as part of the " @entity32 " of @entity1 politics , others have applauded the trend for these more homely views			1
@entity36 : the man who stirred up @entity1 politics @entity1 politics certainly needs more sparkle and a little less seriousness to get the voters more interested -- but at the same time personalities must not be allowed to trump politics , as often happens in the @entity43 when a candidate stumbles over old love affairs or adolescent drug experiences			1
@entity1 have always oscillated between fascination with and scepticism of @entity43 politics , but they have still emulated the most successful @entity43 tactics over the years			1

@entity55 , the first post-war chancellor of @entity51 , had photographs taken while playing boccia at his vacation home in @entity62 , taking care of his beloved rose garden , and baking pancakes			0
a decade later , @entity56 , then the candidate for the @entity67 ( @entity67 ) , sent his campaign manager to the @entity43 to learn from the @entity70 and @entity71 campaigns			1
@entity56 adored @entity71 and followed his lead when he drove around @entity51 in a @entity74 convertible , giving marathon speeches in swing regions			0
@entity3 : @entity78 's mrs. @entity77 last year , representatives of @entity51 's major parties made pilgrimages across the @entity82 again , going to key states like @entity84 and @entity85 , to observe and learn from the @entity88 campaign 's massive digital operation			0
some ideas did make it into the @entity1 campaigns this year , but a lot of strategies just do n't work for the @entity1 electorate			1
cultural differences , the political system , and financial resources make it impossible to adapt many @entity43 tactics			2
those who criticize the " @entity101 " of @entity1 politics are not seeing the obvious differences			2
read more : it 's the economy , @entity105 : @entity0 debate ahead of vote @entity109 , for example , does not occur in @entity51 because the laws are more restrictive than in the @entity43 -- political parties are not allowed to collect data from voters without their consent			2
in addition , the @entity1 public highly distrusts official use of personal information			2
this could be one reason why social media is not yet as successful at turning people out to vote in @entity51 as in the @entity43 -- or it could simply be that a lot of young @entity1 just do n't care about hashtags and retweets			1
the @entity126 tried to emulate @entity88 's extensive ground operation this year , launching their first door - to - door field operation			0
it is unclear if they will reach their target of knocking on five million doors by election day , but what is clear is that canvassing in @entity51 will never be as effective as it is in the @entity43 , because without a data operation , you never know quite who to expect on the other side of the door			2
while @entity88 and @entity142 ran billion dollar campaigns in 2012 , the major @entity1 parties will each spend around $ 25 to $ 30 million on their election fight , the smaller parties less than $ 10 million			1
@entity142 and @entity88 spent $ 160 million dollars on ads in the swing state of @entity84 alone -- that 's more than all the major @entity1 parties combined will spend on the whole 2013 election campaign			1

in @entity51 , most parties release just one minute - and - a - half ad for the entire election			1
@entity43 politicians are constantly campaigning ; by contrast the " heisse @entity167 , " the hot phase of the @entity1 election , did not begin until late august , less than a month before polling day			1
@entity1 campaigns are far from @entity169 , but they are using the best strategies from the @entity43 to make politics more exciting			1
personal exposure still comes in the right doses and flaws are accepted			0
@entity175 candidate @entity36 , the only candidate offering a strong challenge to @entity3 's position as chancellor was on the cover of a nationwide magazine gesturing with his middle finger just two weeks before the election			0
the magazine features an " interview " in which people answer questions with actions , rather than words ; this was @entity184 's answer to those who have taunted the gaffe - prone politician with nicknames during the campaign			0
the picture caused uproar for a couple of days , but the fuss soon died away , without becoming a major issue			0
if either @entity142 or @entity88 had given someone the finger , it would have been the end of their respective campaigns			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity1 campaigns are using strategies from the @entity43 to make politics more exciting , @entity207 says
*unlike* in the @entity43 , most @entity1 parties release just one minute - and - a - half ad for the election
@entity1 have always oscillated between fascination with and scepticism of @entity43 politics
