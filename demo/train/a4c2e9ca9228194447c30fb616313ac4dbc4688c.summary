-- on the surface , it does n't make sense			2
still hurting from the economic crash , @entity4 are driving less and buying more fuel - efficient cars			0
the @entity4 is producing more of its own oil and natural gas than it has in a long time			2
yet the price we pay to fill up our gas tanks keeps going higher			0
it 's close to $ 4 a gallon in many parts of the country and climbing			0
should we blame the speculators , those big investors who snap up oil contracts today on a bet that they will be worth more tomorrow ? it 's easy to work up a lather of outrage about these guys : the same reckless hedge funds and banks that plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the @entity26 of the 1930s are now prolonging it by greedily inflating the price of the one commodity that we ca n't live without ! but it 's not that simple			1
in fact , probably no fact of our daily economic life is as universally felt and poorly understood as gas prices			1
that 's why we at @entity0 have decided to devote our latest series of @entity38 reports to sorting out what 's behind the sticker shock at the pump and how it could become a factor in this year 's presidential election			1
on tuesday , chief business correspondent @entity44 will appear on " starting point with @entity46 " and other shows throughout the day to assess the role of speculators			2
we 'll be examining critical questions : how much does the recent bidding for oil reflect a rational fear that escalating tension over @entity56 's nuclear ambitions could cause @entity57 to block the @entity58 , choking off access to much of the world 's oil supply ? how much of it is a cynical wager on bubble psychology ? and how much of a difference do speculators really make , once you cut through the fog of easy indignation ? on " @entity72 , " our new aviation and regulation reporter @entity70 will explain what 's actually involved in buying and selling a barrel of oil -- and whether it 's a rigged game that only big conglomerates and investors can play			1
and on her prime - time " @entity81 " show , @entity78 will step back and look at the global market for oil , examining where all the demand is coming from and how a global thirst for oil as far away as @entity86 for can affect the price you pay at your station around the corner			0
on " @entity91 " throughout the week , we will also drill down , so to speak , on aspects of the problem that you rarely see explained on television : how oil refineries work , how the availability of " surplus gas " from independent oil companies can play havoc with pump prices , and what effect the squeeze on oil will have on the market for alternative energy			1
on @entity0 and @entity107 , you 'll be able to compare gas prices on a state - by - state map			1
@entity107 : will oil prices kill the stock market rally ? through @entity112 , you can send us your own videos documenting the pain at your local pump and tell us how your own driving habits have changed			0
writers on our opinion page will debate the causes and the fallout , and in our latest of our explain it to me video tutorials , @entity121 offers a 101 primer on why gas prices go up and down			2
and because this is another big week in @entity131 , our political reporters and analysts will weigh in on the implications for the presidential race			0
just as president @entity135 is nurturing a narrative of a slowly healing economy , the @entity134 is looking at the price of gas as @entity140 that his administration remains a failure			0
but before they get to make that case in the fall , the @entity134 will have to settle on a candidate , a ride that so far has been much wilder than anyone predicted			0
will they be any closer after the @entity149 and @entity150 primaries ? tune into @entity0 's special coverage all through the evening on tuesday to find out .			1

in an @entity38 series this week , @entity0 explores why gas prices have shot upward again
@entity0 's @entity156 : it 's easy to blame speculators , but are they really the *culprits* here ?
@entity0 will also look at how rising tensions with @entity56 play into energy prices
