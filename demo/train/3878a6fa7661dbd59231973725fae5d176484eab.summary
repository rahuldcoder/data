a fourth wounded sergeant died in hospital hours after the bomb blast , an official at @entity1 's @entity15 told @entity2 , raising the death toll to five			1
" it was a remote - controlled , fragmentation bomb that was left on the side of the road , " said @entity20 , the governor of @entity1 , in a televised appearance broadcast live from the scene of the explosion			1
" this is a terrorist act			1
" the bomb attack took place in the western , @entity31 side of the city			0
@entity20 said the device hit the third and last of a three - bus convoy that was traveling to the @entity35			0
@entity36 , @entity2 's sister network , broadcast images of the white civilian passenger bus standing in the @entity40 , with purple curtains blowing through shattered windows			0
the network also showed video of a man dressed in civilian clothes bleeding from the stomach , being loaded into an ambulance			0
a splinter @entity50 nationalist group , the @entity49 , claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement posted on the internet			1
" all military forces and groups , bureaucratic persons who have a role in this racist war against @entity50 people are our target , " said the statement , which was released on the @entity57 web - site , the @entity58			1
