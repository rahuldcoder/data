editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- most people are never really alone			1
living here in @entity8 , we 're constantly surrounded by others			0
even in the state 's biggest wilderness , the @entity23 , you ca n't get more than 15 miles or so from civilization			1
similar levels of population density can be found in most of the lower 48 states			0
so when we heard about @entity30 and @entity31 , a couple who live 150 miles above the @entity33 and 60 miles from their nearest neighbors , we had to go meet them			1
the @entity37 reside in the @entity38 , an area about the size of @entity40 in the northeast corner of the state			1
it is bordered by the @entity44 on the north and @entity47 's @entity46 to the east			0
there are other people living in the refuge -- @entity52 in @entity53 and the @entity54 of @entity55 -- but as far as we know , the @entity37 are the most isolated humans in the area			1
they live in the most remote location in @entity61 and sustain themselves by hunting , fishing and trapping			1
they 've lived like this for more than 30 years , raising a family in the process and all the while dealing with grizzly bears and temperatures that dip as low as minus - 50 degrees @entity71			1
their home turf is inhospitable in the truest sense of the word			2
see the rest of @entity77 's @entity38 at @entity9 as much as @entity79 truly is the @entity80 , he 's no @entity81			1
he uses lots of modern tools : guns , the radio , a satellite phone , a chainsaw and , most important , a gasoline - powered snow machine ( a snowmobile in recreational terms ) to check his miles of traps			2
in the wake of the @entity96 spill , the refuge has received renewed attention from the " drill , baby , drill " crowd , which refuses to ever let a good crisis go to waste			0
their claims that the refuge is uninhabited will ring particularly hollow after you watch the above video and catch a glimpse inside the @entity37 ' lives			1
they are , after all , @entity112 and seem to be doing their own thing in their own time , which is perhaps the most @entity112 activity of all			0
still , we did n't set out to make a documentary about the politics of oil drilling			0
that 's boring and has been done a million times already			0
what we wanted was to tell the story of a pair of the last @entity112 who use well - honed skills to survive solely off the land , skills that we are losing at our own peril			0
the @entity37 supplement their myriad abilities with the benefits of oil - based products and machines			2
they understand the necessity of oil			0

@entity30 and @entity31 have lived isolated life for 30 years , raising family in wilderness
in an area the size of @entity40 , their nearest neighbors are more than 60 miles away
@entity9 visits @entity37 , calls area one of most inhospitable environments in @entity61
