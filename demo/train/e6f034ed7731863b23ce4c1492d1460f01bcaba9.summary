@entity0 , @entity1 -- a bomb scare that affected about 100 flights at @entity6 in @entity1 on wednesday may have been a false alarm , @entity1 police told @entity2			1
police launched a huge manhunt wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives , they said			1
police originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions , but he ran			1
they said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives			1
but authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry , grabbed his things and left the airport			1
they do not have the laptop case , they said			2
they are still trying to find the man , they said , but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt			1
police earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went			1
it was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation			0
police did not know which flight the man was booked on			2
part of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled , but was later reopened			0
all planes in the area of @entity52 , where the incident took place , were evacuated and all luggage was removed , police said			1
the passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened , an airport representative told @entity2 , adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally			2
about 100 flights were affected by the security measures			1
some were canceled and others were delayed , the airport said , adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal			0
the airport web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving @entity69 several hours after the incident			2
the incident took place as a @entity74 committee debated the foiled @entity76 attack aboard a plane bound from @entity78 in the @entity79 to @entity80 , @entity81			0
the committee chairman , sen. @entity82 , i - @entity84 , said it is " infuriating " that the december 25 suspect , @entity88 @entity87 , was able to board the plane in the @entity79 with a @entity90 visa			0
@entity91 , secretary of homeland security , said @entity87 " was not on the no - fly list , which would 've flagged him to be prevented from boarding , nor was he on the selectee list , which would 've flagged him for secondary screening			0
" " furthermore , the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in @entity88 and the @entity79 did not detect explosives on his body , " @entity99 said			2
" as this incident underscores , aviation security is increasingly an international responsibility			0
