@entity0 -- for hours on march 21 , @entity4 @entity3 maj. @entity2 of @entity5 , @entity6 , and capt. @entity7 of @entity8 , @entity9 , were the focus of nearly every @entity4 service member in the @entity13 region			1
nearly a dozen aircraft , a platoon of @entity16 and even @entity18 civilians worked to rescue @entity2 and @entity7 after their f - 15 crashed in eastern @entity18			1
most details about the mission , including their names , were a closely held secret by the military			2
but earlier this month , with little notice , their identities and details of their rescue came out during a welcome - home ceremony at their air base			1
for the first time , the men spoke publicly to a small group of friends , family and @entity3 personnel			2
the @entity3 public affairs office posted pictures and video of the event on its official website , even after @entity4 military public affairs officers involved in @entity45 in @entity18 told @entity1 their names would never be made public			1
" you feel the weight of not only the @entity3 , but the entire military , focusing on you , making sure you get home , " @entity7 said recently in a video prepared by the @entity3			1
@entity4 still not ready to recognize @entity18 opposition the men were part of a the @entity54 normally based at @entity55 , a @entity57 base that has hosted @entity4 @entity3 units for years in @entity59 , @entity60			1
but on march 21 they took off from the @entity4 air base in @entity62 , @entity63 , in support of the no - fly zone enforcement over @entity18			1
at some point they ran into trouble			0
" we soon find ourselves in a situation where we are forced to eject over potentially hostile territory , and over the country of @entity18			2
something that neither one of us would ever have thought that we 'd have to do , " @entity2 , the pilot of the @entity73 said			0
the @entity3 is still trying to figure out why the plane crashed and a post-incident investigation is ongoing , but four days after the crash , vice adm. @entity76 , director of the joint staff at the @entity77 , told reporters that the military was " confident that it is not a result of hostile fire			1
" homes destroyed in battle for @entity85 after the ejection , @entity2 -- " @entity86 " to his fellow fliers -- and " @entity88 became separated			0
" when you find yourself alone , and you 're isolated , in a country where there 's hostiles , you are scared , " said @entity2 , a veteran of both the @entity91 and @entity92 wars			0
@entity7 was found by @entity18 civilians who protected him from possible retaliation by forces loyal to @entity18 leader @entity100 , and eventually he was taken safely back to @entity101			0
details of how he was taken out of @entity18 have yet to be disclosed			2
@entity2 's rescue came more quickly			0
he stayed in communications with another f - 15 pilot still in the air over @entity18			2
eventually an @entity108 carrying @entity16 who were part of a @entity110 , or @entity111 , team landed near his position			0
" as that back door opened , i see a group of young @entity16 recon units jump out , and that was probably the best feeling i 've ever felt in my entire life , " @entity2 said			0
he was flown to the @entity119 for a quick medical check then a short time later sent home with @entity7 to @entity55 , where friends and family welcomed them with hugs and a rendition of " @entity128			0

two @entity3 fliers went down over @entity18 on march 21
both were rescued , with the military *keeping* quiet on details
now , an @entity3 video from their welcome - home ceremony provides some of the story
" you feel the weight of **...** the entire military **...** making sure you get home , " says one
