-- @entity3 shooter @entity1 may have called a radio show nearly a year before his rampage , drawing parallels between a @entity8 chimpanzee that mauled a woman in 2009 and a " teenage mall shooter or something like that , " according to a report published thursday in the @entity14			1
the newspaper identified the caller as @entity1 , based on @entity18 postings and confirmation by two of the late shooter 's friends			1
@entity0 can not confirm that the recorded voice is @entity1 's , but if it is his , it could provide previously unknown insight into the mind of the 20 - year - old , who killed 26 people at the @entity28 , @entity8 , school before killing himself as police closed in			1
" this is ( him ) saying , ' hey listen , there is going to be another shooting , there is going to be another outbreak of violence , ' " clinical psychologist @entity31 told @entity0 , assuming the voice is that of @entity1			1
continuing with what he believed the caller meant , @entity31 added , " but it 's not as random as you think it is			1
there 's a reason that these things happen			2
" the 2011 call to the show " @entity52 , " which broadcasts on a @entity50 campus station and streams on the @entity18 , focuses on the story of @entity54 , a chimpanzee shot to death by police after he mauled his owner 's friend at the @entity61 , @entity8 , home where he lived			1
the friend suffered devastating , albeit not life - ending injuries in the february 2009 attack			2
the chimp -- who had been featured in tv commercials for @entity67 and @entity68 -- was shot multiple times by @entity61 police as he tried to enter a cruiser before returning to the house and dying inside , police said			0
chimp attack 911 call : ' he 's ripping her apart ' in the nearly seven - minute segment , the caller -- who identifies himself as " @entity78 " and speaks in a low , clipped monotone -- laments perceptions of the chimpanzee after the attack , which he said did n't happen " simply because he was a senselessly violent , impulsive chimp			1
" " immediately before his attack , he had desperately been wanting his owner to drive him somewhere , and the best reason i can think of for why he would want that , looking at his entire life , is some little thing he experienced was the last straw , and he was overwhelmed by the life he had and he wanted to get out of it by changing his environment , " the caller said			1
" and the best way he knew how to deal with that was by getting his owner to drive him somewhere else			0
" after the owner 's friend arrived , the chimp " knew that she was trying to coax him back into his life of domestication , " the caller added			2
" he could n't handle that , so he attacked her and anyone else who approached him , " he said			0
" and dismissing his attack as simply being the senseless violence and impulsiveness of a chimp , instead of a human , is wishful thinking at best			1
" that primate 's story can inform how humans act , and sometimes snap , the caller speculated			2
" his attacks can be parallel to the attacks , the random acts of violence , that you see on your show every week , committed by humans which the mainstream also has no explanation for , " he said			1
" an actual human , i do n't think it would be such a stretch			0
he very well could be a teenage mall shooter or something like that			0
... " police release final report on @entity28 school shooting the show 's host , @entity135 , said thursday the idea that he might have been talking to someone who would massacre young children was " really chilling			1
" at the time , though , he thought the caller seemed rational in making a valid point about how anyone -- whether they are animal or human -- can feel pushed over the edge in modern society			2
" this guy ... was beyond the pale and yet , i think , he made an accurate point ( about ) these flipouts , " @entity135 -- who bills himself as " an anti-civilization theorist " -- told @entity0 's @entity155			0
" anyone who reads the paper now and then would have noticed that is happening			0
and maybe we should try to find out why , what it 's telling us about the society			0
" while saying such conversation on a program called @entity52 might not stand to most , @entity31 said psychologists like himself might spot " red flags " like the caller 's " very robotic " and controlled voice and his referring to " society " and " humans acting out , not to mention the mention of mall shootings			1
criminologist @entity173 , a professor of justice and law administration at @entity176 in @entity177 , said she sees parallels between this call and @entity1 's later rampage			2
" i think the subtext of what he is saying is that violence is innate and instinctual to humans and really should not be punished because it is their natural basis , " @entity181 said			0
" that 's the message he 's trying to get across , and the parallel to himself is obvious			0
" he feels possessed by this need , this compulsion to commit violence			0
" a year later : nation reflects on legacy of its second - deadliest mass shooting			0
