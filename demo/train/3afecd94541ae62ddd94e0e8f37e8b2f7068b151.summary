-- uniformed @entity2 police pull a woman in nothing but her underclothes from a frenzied mob			1
" get back boy ! get back ! " the officers say as one lifts his pistol into the air			0
large patches of skin on the victim appear bloodied and raw as she struggles to walk toward a police van with hordes of men still fighting for a handful of her body			2
moments later , she falls to the ground , naked			0
police carry her into the vehicle , seemingly incapable of thwarting the crowd			0
in the background , revelers set off fireworks and wave flags to celebrate the election of @entity2 's new president			1
this is just one of at least five mob sexual assaults that took place in @entity35 's @entity34 in the past week , according to the " @entity39 " campaign , which documents sexual violence against women in @entity2			1
the attack is shown in a less than two - minute viral cell phone video that @entity0 can not independently verify			0
it is unclear when the video was shot , but social media reports indicate the incident took place tuesday after @entity2 's election body announced @entity48 won elections in a landslide			1
days later , as the restive country celebrated the presidential inauguration , human rights groups documented more sexual assaults in @entity34			2
" it is shameful that the security leaders of the @entity57 did not take into account any security measures or plans to prevent such incidents , " a statement from the " @entity64 " campaign reads			0
" junior officers and individuals were left alone to face sexual harassment groups without any tools or plans			1
" four of the five victims sexually assaulted in the square required medical attention , the " @entity39 " campaign said			1

the response by authorities did little to squelch anger on social media channels , where many criticized the authorities and criticized local media for a lack of professionalism			0
" they are happy , huh ? " @entity107 said laughingly about the crowd on private network @entity109 during a live report on harassment from inside the square			0
@entity107 publicly apologized monday , saying her comments were misunderstood			0
activists said the anchorwoman 's jarring remarks appeared part of a general trend by @entity2 's pro-military factions to sideline the systemic violence against women in favor of glorifying @entity2 's new head of state , former army chief @entity48			1
the state - affiliated @entity125 characterized sunday night 's violence as an orchestrated conspiracy against @entity48 , saying , " the acts were meant to spoil the joy of @entity2 and their wedding of democracy			2

" for a long time harassers have been able to harass with impunity			0
now with this amendment to the law it is a good opportunity to take action not just in cases of mob assault but in cases of everyday sexual harassment , " @entity139 said			2
