-- a hacker scandal involving a video is sending shockwaves through @entity4 's presidential campaign just days before sunday 's election , making the already volatile electoral process even more contentious as parties accuse each other of dirty tricks and schemes			1
the video published by the weekly news magazine " @entity12 " in @entity13 allegedly shows @entity14 , the leading presidential candidate , getting secret military information from a man who was arrested earlier this month and accused of illegal hacking activities			1
@entity18 , 29 , was arrested on may 5 and accused of " managing an illegal office dedicated to intercepting emails from between those close to the peace dialogues in @entity23 ( @entity24 ) , " according to a news release published by the @entity4 attorney general 's office			1
the government of president @entity28 , who is running for re-election , has held peace talks with the @entity33 @entity32 guerrillas since late 2012			1
authorities confiscated 69 pieces of evidence , including computers and usb drives belonging to the suspect , according to the attorney general 's office			0
@entity14 told reporters the five - minute video is " a vulgar montage " put together to smear his campaign			1
" this video montage is a trap			0
it 's no coincidence that it 's been published when i 'm on top in the polls and the president is going down , " @entity14 said			2
@entity28 has not commented directly on the video			2
a poll published by @entity54 on friday , before the scandal broke , said @entity14 would receive 29.5 % of the vote versus 28.5 % for @entity28			1
@entity4 law forbids the publication of polls seven days before a presidential election , so there 's no way of knowing whether the scandal has changed last week 's percentages			2
former president @entity64 , a @entity65 supporter , called the video " a montage " and suggested the scandal is the creation of the @entity28 campaign			2
" ( @entity71 ) is an alleged ' hacker ' who has worked with ( @entity74 political strategist ) @entity75 , who 's close to president @entity28			0
in the video , they show @entity14 getting information that has already been in the rumor mill and has no relevance , " @entity64 said			2
@entity75 had been working for the @entity28 campaign but resigned earlier this month after accusations surfaced that he had received $ 12 million from drug traffickers in exchange for political favors in the @entity28 government			0
in the past , @entity75 worked for @entity64			0
@entity87 , the @entity88 ( @entity89 ) presidential candidate , told @entity0 affiliate @entity90 he believes @entity14 has committed a serious crime			0
" we 're talking about the crime of illegal wiretapping , conspiracy to commit a crime , and the crime of using military information and intelligence			0
we @entity4 can not resign ourselves to this			0
these are not the leaders we want , " @entity87 said			0
@entity102 , a pollster with @entity54 , says @entity4 voters essentially face one choice : do they vote for the candidate who wants peace talks with the @entity32 or the one who wants the guerrillas to surrender ? " the difference regarding the candidates ' position in the economy and other issues is minimal , but when it comes to how to handle the guerrilla , it 's abysmal , " @entity102 said			1
" @entity28 is advocating for a continuation of the peace talks he started in 2012 , while @entity14 's position is that there should not be a dialogue with an illegal guerrilla until its fighters surrender to government forces and lay down their weapons , " @entity102 said			1
there are five presidential candidates , but the only two with a real possibility of winning are @entity14 and @entity28 , according to @entity102			1
@entity4 electoral law says to win a presidential election , a candidate must obtain 50 % of the vote plus one vote , which means a second round on june 15 is very likely .			0
