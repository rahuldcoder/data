@entity0 -- a man walks through @entity0 's @entity3 with a backpack and puts it down by a potted plant			0
he looks like any traveler			0
but inside his backpack are explosives			1
five minutes later , a yellow @entity11 named @entity12 enters the same crowded room , straining at her handler 's leash			0
she has picked up the scent of black powder in the air and tracks it to the foot of the ficus tree , where she sits and waits eagerly for a reward			2
this is not a thwarted terrorist strike but a demonstration of what a " vapor wake " dog can do			1
for years , specially trained dogs have run their noses over objects to screen for explosives			1
but vapor wake dogs can detect explosives in the air despite crowds , cross-currents and other odors			1
their trainers say some of the dogs have been able to enter a room and pick up the scent as much as 15 minutes after explosives have passed through			1
proponents say the dogs can detect a few grams of explosives			1
most are trained to recognize a dozen , but some dogs have learned as many as 20 types , including @entity52 , the explosive used in the @entity54 transit bombings , and ammonium nitrate , which @entity56 used to bring down the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity59			2
if a dog needs to learn an explosive , it can do so in one or two days			0
" technology sometimes goes bad after two , three years , and you have to get new stuff , " said capt. @entity63 of the @entity64			0
" a dog gets better as the years go on			0
" @entity63 says he is amazed by the dogs ' capabilities and compares them to top athletes			2
" @entity73 was one of the best basketball players of all time , and these vapor wake dogs i put in the same category			1
" at an @entity80 kennel in @entity81 , @entity82 , yellow labrador retriever puppies romp and roll in a grassy pen			1
they have been bred for vapor wake traits , but only 1 or 2 percent of them will make the cut			1
@entity88 , who manages the puppy program , says successful vapor wake dogs must have a strong instinct to hunt			1
" they 'll hunt and hunt and hunt and wo n't come back without it , " @entity92 said			0
@entity95 , who developed the program , says his best dogs are friendly but not overly social			2
" they could care less about being petted , " @entity95 explained			0
" we are looking for a dog that is just very strong and very independent in searching , pick up air scent very easily without the direction of a handler			2
" at a few weeks old , the dogs are introduced to a variety of walking surfaces , like the slippery tiles they will find in a transit station			2
they are exposed to noises and large groups of people to make them more adaptable			2
older puppies are then placed in prisons in @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity82 , where inmates begin teaching them to use their noses			1
eventually , they come back to @entity80 and undergo a training regimen that is largely secret and is in the process of being patented			0
the dogs get 25 weeks of training , 14 of them with their permanent handlers			2
" the dogs , when you get them , have more training than you do , and you have to play catch up , " said @entity64 police officer @entity130 , who works with @entity12			0
the @entity135 have just started using the $ 20,000 vapor wake dogs			1
the @entity137 has a few			0
but @entity64 @entity135 have made them a key part of their explosive detection strategy			0
@entity63 says they provide a non-intrusive way of screening large numbers of passengers			0
" you can take the dog to the situation ; you do n't need to take the situation to the dog , " he said			0
" they can go anywhere and adjust to the situation			0
they can be out in the cold			0
they can be out in the wind or the rain or the storm			0
what equipment can do that ? " although @entity64 's dogs have hit on fertilizer , nitroglycerin pills and photo paper , which all contain the same chemicals as explosives , @entity63 said all the situations were quickly resolved			1
@entity168 , a veterinarian who is director of @entity80 's @entity169 and @entity170 , says dogs ' noses are remarkably sensitive instruments that sample the air several times a second			1
he compares a vapor wake dog to a chef who can discern the scent of a particular herb in a complex stew			1
for the dogs , @entity168 says , finding explosives is simply a game : " at some point , this one scent comes up , and he 's like ' oh , that 's the one i like ! that 's the one i get rewarded for ! i love this , so let 's go find this ! ' "			1

vapor wake dogs can detect small traces of explosives in air
dogs are bred for *job* , but less than 2 percent will make the cut
