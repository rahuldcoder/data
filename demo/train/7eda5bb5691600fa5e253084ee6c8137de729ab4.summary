-- when @entity2 underwent shoulder surgery five years ago , many thought her tennis career would n't last			1
but there is now a good chance the four - time grand slam winner will play into her 30s before fully turning her attention to her numerous business interests			1
" i think she 's going to play another four to five years and through the @entity13 ( in 2016 ) if she stays healthy and hungry , " her long - time agent and close friend @entity16 told @entity0 's @entity17			1
@entity2 's motivation has never been an issue in the past , and the @entity20 -- who turned 26 last week -- is now fully fit			1
that , however , was n't the case in 2008 , when the shoulder injury ruled her out for nine months and cast doubt on @entity2 's professional career , which began on the day she turned 14			1
she had been experiencing discomfort in her right -- and serving -- shoulder , with initial tests leading doctors to believe inflammation was the cause			2
when the pain intensified after a win at a tournament in @entity39 in july 2008 , she underwent an mri that revealed two small tears in the tendon of her shoulder			0
so began the long process of rehabilitation , surgery , another stint of rehab and dealing with another injury , a bone bruise			0
it was a difficult time for @entity2			2
" the shoulder , it 's a huge part of the tennis game , " she told @entity17			2
" the serve is huge and my game is all about being aggressive and powerful strokes , so when you 're out of the game nine months , when you do n't have too many examples of athletes coming back after such an injury , of course you have doubters			2
" @entity2 never lost faith that she would recover , but she would have to wait another three years before reaching another grand slam final , losing at @entity68 in 2011			1
thankfully for @entity2 , no such serious injuries have reoccurred , although she was troubled by an ankle problem later that year			1
" i had to work through a lot of things , and more mentally as well because i always thought that during those months that i was away , everyone was working and everyone was training and everyone was playing so it kind of felt like i was left behind a little bit , " she said			0
@entity16 's pronouncement about @entity2 's future comes as a boost to the women 's tennis tour due to @entity2 's enormous star power and fan base , which increased when she won the @entity86 last june to cap her comeback and become just the 10th woman to capture all four majors			1
@entity91 lists @entity2 was last year named by @entity91 as the world 's 71st most powerful celebrity			1
she was the highest - ranked female athlete on the list , ahead of @entity95 , despite the @entity96 now owning 11 more grand slam titles			0
@entity2 is , according to @entity91 , the world 's highest - paid female athlete , pulling in almost $ 28 million -- more than her career prize money -- over a 12 - month period that ended last july			1
sponsors including @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and , most recently , @entity111 help pad @entity2 's wallet			1
the @entity112 - based @entity20 has also launched @entity113 , her own premium candy line , in the @entity96 and plans on expanding to @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			1
but @entity2 remains adamant that success on the court is her first priority			2
" do i want my candy to sell ? do i want my partnership to continue for many years ? of course i do , " @entity2 said			1
" that 's a no - brainer			2
but at the end of the day all the things that have come to me , that i 've been able to be a part of , is because i 'm a tennis player , not because i 'm a model or because of acting			0
the core of what i have is my tennis			0
" her results in 2013 confirm @entity2 's drive			1
known as one of tennis ' toughest competitors and hardest workers , she has showed no signs of slowing down			0
the power baseliner has reached at least the semifinals in all four of her tournaments and almost completed a rare double at the @entity145 in @entity145 and @entity147 's @entity146			0
she won the title in @entity149 in march but was defeated by @entity95 in the finale in @entity112 two weeks later			0
her poor record against @entity95 might add to her hunger			0
@entity95 beat @entity2 for the 11th straight time , although @entity2 won a set off the world no. 1 for the first time in five years			1
missing gold @entity2 lacks an @entity157 , too , having been crushed by @entity95 in the gold medal match at @entity159 and missing 2008 in @entity160 with the shoulder injury			1
" i always feel like i can be better and when i do step on the court , i feel a certain power with what i 'm doing , " @entity2 said			2
" i feel strong and i feel like i 'm good at what i do			0
" i want to keep working , and i want to keep getting better because you ca n't stand still			0
i 'm sure everyone 's getting stronger and getting faster and hitting the ball harder			0
you have to do it as well			0
" @entity2 begins her clay - court swing as defending champion in @entity174 this week before competing at the @entity175 and @entity176 in @entity176 ahead of her title defense at @entity86 , which starts may 26			1
her titles in @entity174 and @entity176 in 2012 served as the springboard to her success in @entity181 , where @entity2 downed @entity183 @entity182 in the final			2
having come back from the abyss that her career - threatening injury presented , @entity2 savored the success -- especially after being written off by many critics while she was rebuilding her career , suffering some morale - sapping defeats			1
" losing is never easy , especially when you 've achieved so much great success and having lifted beautiful trophies , " she said			0
" and especially when you hear it from people that , you know , they sit there and comment on what you 're doing and they do n't comment on the work that you put in before something like that , before getting to the stage of a match in front of thousands of people			0
" but it makes you so much stronger , and i 've looked back and , you know , the people i felt had that connection with me , i 've certainly spoken with them about it and especially had a few words with them after the @entity86			2
" but it 's sport			0
i think the world revolves around comments and opinions , and i have absolutely nothing against it			0

having overcome a shoulder injury , @entity2 plans on playing for 4 - 5 more years
she won her first major *post-surgery* at last year 's @entity86 to complete her *collection*
@entity20 says she enjoyed proving her doubters wrong by *returning* from injury
