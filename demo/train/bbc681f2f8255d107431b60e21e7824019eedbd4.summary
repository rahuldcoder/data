@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 founder and editor @entity3 said @entity1 authorities reached " the height of irresponsibility " by issuing an arrest warrant alleging rape against him , then revoking it less than a day later			1
" it is clearly a smear campaign , " @entity3 told @entity13 news network @entity12 in a live telephone interview sunday			2
" ... the only question is , who was involved ? " asked who he thinks was behind the accusations , @entity3 told the network , " we have some suspicions about who would benefit , but without direct evidence , i would not be willing to make a direct allegation			1
" meanwhile , the @entity27 said in an update on its website that @entity3 's name was leaked to the media , and the authority -- which does not normally publish the names of suspects -- " did not in this case initiate publication			1
" however , the office did confirm @entity3 's identity and later published his name in statements about his arrest and the subsequent revocation			1
an arrest warrant was filed against @entity3 in absentia on friday			1
@entity1 media , citing unnamed sources , reported that two women , ages 20 and 30 , reported the allegations to police , leading to the warrant being filed			1
the @entity52 , a respected @entity1 daily , said the 30 - year - old told the newspaper that the younger woman had approached her with a story similar to hers -- that she had consensual sex with @entity3 but that the situation had turned abusive			1
@entity60 , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor 's office , would not confirm the reports			0
but on saturday , less than full day later , chief prosecutor @entity64 said in a statement posted on the authority 's website that @entity3 was " no longer wanted " and " is not suspected of rape			1
" the prosecution authority said on its website sunday , " when ms. @entity64 became in charge of the matter on saturday , she had more information than the first prosecutor had on friday night			0
decisions on coercive measures , like arrest , should constantly be re-evaluated during an investigation and must always be based on the actual information			0
" " the decision to appoint @entity64 as prosecutor in charge was made on saturday , " the authority said			0
" under most circumstances the duty prosecutors on monday morning hand over all weekend matters to different prosecutors who will be in fully in charge of the investigations			0
" however , serious crimes or high - profile matters can be handed over earlier to lessen the burden on the duty prosecutors , the posting said			0
" the matter concerning mr. @entity3 was judged as such a matter			2
" @entity60 told @entity2 affiliate @entity97 that the decision to issue the warrant was made by an " on - call prosecutor " and that @entity64 revoked the warrant on saturday			2
such differences in prosecutorial judgment are common in @entity1 , she said			2
the arrest warrant also mentioned a molestation charge , but molestation -- which is not limited to child victims in @entity1 -- is not a crime punishable by jail time			1
@entity60 told @entity110 is still under investigation for molestation			0
asked about that investigation by @entity12 , @entity3 -- who said he is on holiday in the north of @entity1 -- said , " i have no details on what that is about			1
i can not imagine any event where that would be credible			0
" he said he has not been contacted by @entity1 police , but has directed his attorney to contact them			2
@entity3 told the network he was warned of an impending smear campaign			2
in a posting saturday on the @entity126 , @entity3 said , " the charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing			1
" asked if he had anything to tell @entity1 authorities , @entity3 said he would ask that they be cautious " and not issue statements and retract them six hours later " given the seriousness of the situation			1
@entity64 , the posting sunday said , " will work with the investigation " next week			0
" at the moment , it is not possible to estimate when more information can be given or which decisions will be made			0
" @entity4 has triggered controversy by recently posting some 76,000 @entity146 documents related to the war in @entity148			1
an elusive figure , @entity3 reportedly lives part - time in @entity1			1
he told the @entity1 newspaper @entity150 last week that he had been in @entity1 because he wanted a safe - place to go after the high - profile document leak -- which has been called the biggest leak since the @entity154 about the @entity155			0
@entity146 defense secretary @entity156 criticized the leak , saying it would have a significant negative impact on troops and allies , revealing techniques and procedures			0
and @entity148 president @entity163 has expressed concern that the leaks will put informants ' lives at risk			0
asked sunday by @entity12 about @entity163 's comment that he has blood on his hands , @entity3 said it was " extraordinary thing to hear , a comment like that , from a man like that , who has waded his whole life in blood			2
" he pointed out that the @entity179 has said it was not aware of anyone coming to harm because of the documents ' release			0
another 15,000 documents are being reviewed and will be released soon , @entity3 said			2
@entity2 's @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
