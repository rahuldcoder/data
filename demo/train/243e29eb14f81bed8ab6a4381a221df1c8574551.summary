@entity0 -- acts signed for october 's tribute concert for @entity5 include @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 , the promoters told @entity1 thursday			1
members of the @entity12 taking the stage october 8 in @entity14 , @entity15 , include several of @entity5 's brothers , " the next generation of @entity18 , " and @entity19 , which consists of @entity21 's three sons			1
alternative rock band @entity22 and @entity24 r&b singer @entity23 are also on the bill , while other artists will be added in the next few days , according to promoter @entity27			0
" this announcement is just the beginning , we have many more to announce , " @entity27 executive @entity29 said			2
" this concert will unite various generations and musical genres , reminding everyone of just how amazing a talent @entity38 was			0
" with the " @entity39 : the @entity42 " lineup now known , fans can start " registering their interest for tickets " online at http://www.michaelforevertribute.com / beginning thursday , the promoter said			1
a lottery will determine which fans will be invited to purchase tickets , it said			2
the concert in the @entity54 in @entity14 , which seats 75,000 people , would be at least four hours long , @entity27 ceo @entity52 said			2
@entity5 matriarch @entity56 and the promoter are scheduled to discuss the show 's plans in a live broadcast on @entity1 monday			1
the delay produced grumbling and doubts expressed on @entity5 fan websites , but promoters hope the revelation of the lineup will satisfy them			1
" fans of @entity38 's music will get the concert they 've been waiting for , " @entity52 said in a message posted on the promoter 's website last week			2
two of the five surviving @entity5 brothers , @entity73 and @entity75 , objected to the timing of the show , issuing a sharply worded statement last month that reflected a deep division within the @entity12			1
" we want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family , " the two brothers said in a joint statement after their mother and four siblings endorsed the show			1
" while we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding @entity38 's death , " @entity73 and @entity75 said			2
the involuntary manslaughter trial of @entity5 's physician , dr. @entity97 , begins in september and is expected to continue into october			1
while @entity56 has previously said she would attend every day of @entity97 's trial -- as she did when her son was tried on a sex charge -- the promoter said the @entity5 mother will travel to @entity15 for the concert			1
" in light of this , we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill - timed event and its promoter , @entity110 , " @entity75 and @entity104 said			0
their statement said the idea of the october concert was presented to the entire family in april " as an idea already in its advanced stages			0
" the decision to go ahead with it " disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms " by some members of the @entity12 , they said			0
the @entity123 agreed with the two brothers , issuing a similar statement			0
" we share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyone 's care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice			0
we believe that , as stated by @entity73 and @entity75 , the most important tribute we can give to @entity5 at this time is to seek justice in his name			2
" @entity5 fans posted messages on the concert 's @entity140 page questioning ticket prices and the process for buying them			1
fans must register for a chance to buy a ticket			0
while the website initially said the higher a pledge to a charity they make while registering , the better their chances of getting a good seat			0
it was later revised to say that donations are not mandatory and all applications will have an equal chance			0
a portion of the concert proceeds , particularly fan pledges , will go to charities , @entity162 and @entity163 , the promoters said			0
a spokesman for @entity5 's estate said last month that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate 's executors to use the late pop singer 's name or image			1
" the estate has not been contacted and is not involved with @entity27 in the @entity176 tribute concert announced today , " spokesman @entity173 told @entity1 .			0
