like countless @entity1 , i recently watched the entire second season of hit political drama " @entity4 " in one weekend after @entity1 video streaming site @entity5 released all 13 nearly hour - long episodes			1
but the website i logged on was @entity9 -- one of the @entity12 's biggest online video services -- that purchased exclusive rights to the series for mainland @entity12 , and posted the latest season at the same time as @entity5			1
glued to my laptop , i could n't help but notice the major role @entity12 plays this season as one riveting plot unfolds after another			2
if you have been reading news headlines out of @entity12 , you would find any of the @entity12 angles familiar and believable : suspected cyber espionage , a trade war with @entity26 , a territorial dispute with @entity28 -- complete with an utterly corrupt @entity30 insider who boasts direct access to the decision - making @entity32			2
censors all this " realness " makes it a little surreal that my binge - viewing of the @entity1 tv series happened in @entity12			1
this , after all , is a country where the government allows only 34 foreign films to be screened in cinemas every year , and propaganda authorities routinely censor @entity12 - related material from foreign sources that they deem politically sensitive or merely unflattering			1
case in point : " the blacklist , " a new @entity1 crime drama , is widely available on @entity12 video sites -- except @entity51			1
that episode has been removed by all streaming services -- including @entity9 -- because it features a @entity12 spy who kills @entity56 operatives as its main villain , and critiques @entity12 's controversial one - child family planning policy			1
the @entity12 subplots in " @entity4 , " season 2 do n't exactly portray the country all that positively , but the government appears to be leaving @entity9 alone			1
" we did n't know the second season would have so much to do with @entity12 -- probably because of the increasing importance of @entity12 in global affairs , " @entity64 , @entity9 's chief executive , told me at a press conference tuesday			1
" many @entity12 people -- including officials -- are watching it now and we have had no problem			2
" " so ( the @entity1 shows on your site ) are not subject to censorship ? " i asked			0
" so far , no , " he replied			0
hands off some analysts are surprised by the government 's largely hands - off approach to video streaming sites , but caution that it may not last			0
" new media is allowed to develop with less interference than older forms where there is already a structure in place , " said @entity85 , a long - time @entity86 - based observer and commentator on @entity12 media			0
" it 's going to be regulated just like any other media , especially if it becomes big enough , powerful enough and popular enough			0
" for now , @entity9 is focusing on broadening the appeal of " @entity4 , " scrambling to add @entity12 subtitles and bombarding visitors to its website with banner ads. @entity9 users have clearly noticed			2
the series ' latest and original seasons now occupy the top two spots in @entity9 's chart of most - watched @entity1 tv shows			1
season 2 has been clocking almost three million views a day -- impressive for a complex story that requires a deep understanding of @entity1 politics			0
gripping plots in comments left online , many @entity12 viewers indicated they are drawn to the show for the same reasons as fans elsewhere : gripping plot twists , superb acting and stark parallel to reality			2
" if you have to see the show as social commentary , i think it 's a strong diatribe against the political system in the @entity1 rather than against @entity12 , " said @entity123 , a well - known columnist for @entity124 , the country 's official @entity125 - language newspaper			1
" the narrative does n't fault @entity12 but rather just one individual from @entity12			0
" a widely circulated @entity135 post claims that @entity12 's anti-corruption tsar -- one of the seven @entity139 members who effectively rule the country -- is a loyal fan of " @entity4 " and has recommended it to other officials			0
the anecdote may not be as far - fetched as one might think , considering what the show 's machiavellian protagonist @entity145 tells viewers while being sworn in as the @entity1 vice president : " one heartbeat away from the presidency and not a single vote cast in my name -- democracy is so overrated			0
" with messages like that , " @entity4 " seems to be a show @entity12 's communist leaders do n't mind their citizens watching at all .			0
