@entity0 -- in the @entity3 , there is pre-kennedy and post-kennedy			1
the shots fired by @entity6 that killed president @entity7 on november 22 , 1963 , set in motion a series of reforms to the @entity3 , the agency in charge of protecting @entity13 's most powerful leaders			1
in the 50 years since the assassination of @entity13 's 35th president , the @entity3 force has increased nearly tenfold and its budget grown by roughly 58 % a year			1
the organization that exists today has 3,400 agents and budget of $ 1.6 billion , a significant increase from the 350 agents and budget of $ 5.5 million in 1963 , according to @entity3 spokesman special agent @entity24			1
" as the threats change , the @entity3 has changed , " @entity24 said			1
the @entity26 , established after the @entity7 assassination , created the " intelligence division " designed to expand and improve relations with other agencies , including state and local law enforcement and mental health institutions , and the " technical security division " that assesses the security of an environment , including air quality and fire safety			1
in the 1970s the organization expanded to include a counter-sniper unit and counter-assault teams			0
50 years on , nation pauses to remember @entity7 's death the uncovered limousine that @entity7 rode through @entity45 a half - century ago is hard to imagine in today			1
according to former agent @entity46 , who co-wrote " the @entity48 " and was with the former president when he was shot , @entity7 chafed at the close proximity of his protective detail and was quoted saying " have the @entity52 charlatans drop back to the follow - up car ... we 've got an election coming up			2
the whole point is for me to be accessible to the people			0
" today , president @entity58 is transported in a limousine known as " @entity60 , " which could be described as an armored safe on wheels			0
its doors alone weigh as much as those on a @entity66 757 , according to a @entity67 special on the @entity3			2
@entity58 has called the car " a fortified limousine " and while in @entity70 earlier this year contrasted the current state of presidential travel with that of @entity74 , who visited the country while he was a @entity13 senator in 1966			0
@entity7 assassination a collective memory for @entity13 children " it was a little different back then			1
@entity7 and his wife , @entity82 , rode in the back of an open truck , " @entity58 said at the state house in @entity81 , @entity70 in july			2
" @entity85 has me and @entity86 inside a fortified limousine			0
we call it ' @entity60			0
' as @entity7 's truck made its way through the crowds , he picked up two boys and let them ride alongside them			1
the @entity3 does n't let me do these things			2
" @entity24 also pointed to other present - day protocols , including covered arrivals and departures , extensive use of magnetometers and separation from the media , many of which were instituted after the march 1981 assassination attempt on president @entity108 and designed to increase the safety of @entity13 's presidents			2
for agents who receive months of extensive training , historic events like those targeted attacks on @entity7 and @entity108 serve as moments from which to learn			1
@entity24 said agents " learn from all incidents " to improve upon protective operations , which extend beyond the commander in chief			0
5 things you might not know about @entity7 's assassination former presidents , their spouses and children were added to the protected list in 1965 , major candidates and their spouses in 1968 , foreign heads of state in 1971 and the coordination of special events like inaugurations in 1998			1
the extensive vetting process of presidential site visits , known as " advance , " has also grown			0
@entity24 described the advance protocols as " comprehensive " and said they include close cooperation with state and local officials surrounding everything from the president 's arrival at the airport to the motorcade route			0
it 's a process , about which the president references , most recently , at least publicly , at a june fundraiser for the @entity152 in @entity153			0
" opening up your house is a big deal on any occasion			0
when you 've got @entity3 and everybody else running around , moving furniture , potentially bumping into that painting that 's probably worth a lot of money ... that makes you more stressed , " @entity58 told @entity152 donors			1
" so can you all please move away from the painting ? @entity165 wanted to make that point			0
" and just as often , a more serious tone from the president about his protection is expressed			0
" as president , i get to meet and work with a lot of extraordinary law enforcement officers every single day , from men and women who protect me and my family -- the folks in the @entity3 -- to local police who help out on motorcades in events around the country , " @entity58 said at a @entity171 ceremony at the @entity172 in may			2
" i 'm incredibly grateful that all these law enforcement officers are doing such outstanding work			0
