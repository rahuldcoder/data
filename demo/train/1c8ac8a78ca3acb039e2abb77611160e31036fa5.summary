@entity0 -- a county prosecutor in @entity3 is proposing a law that could punish parents with jail time for repeatedly missing their children 's parent - teacher conferences			1
@entity10 prosecutor @entity9 introduced a proposal tuesday at a @entity13 meeting that would require a parent to attend at least one parent - teacher conference a year or face up to three days in jail , according @entity17 , @entity9 's press secretary			1
the proposal , which @entity9 has also sent to the state legislature and the @entity20 , would exempt parents whose children are performing exceptionally well or who are actively engaged with their children 's teachers			1
parents who are unable to travel for health reasons also would be exempt			2
so far the proposal has met with mixed responses			1
@entity32 president @entity31 @entity30 applauded @entity9 's idea , saying he would support legislation			1
" it 's child abuse when your child is failing in school and you 're not involved , because you are strapping that child to a life of poverty , " @entity30 told @entity1			0
he noted , however , that jailing parents for missing school meetings might not be practical and suggested altering the punishment			2
" if it 's not jail maybe it 's something else , but we 've got to do something to get the parents ' attention , " he said			1
@entity50 , a member of the @entity52 board , said that he agrees with the need to get parents involved , but called the idea " the dumbest thing i 've ever heard			0
" " you ca n't legislate parental involvement			0
i think this proposal is purely political and a real neat way to get your name in the paper , " @entity50 said			0
@entity10 commissioner @entity63 , @entity64 , blasted the proposal because she feels that @entity9 has bigger problems she needs to deal with first			1
" @entity9 has a record of complaining that her office does n't have enough funding to prosecute violent crimes , and now she wants to put parents in jail			1
it 's despicable , " @entity63 said			0
according to the proposed ordinance , teachers would work to accommodate parents ' schedules by setting up conferences at any time during the day			0
additionally , any parent convicted under the law would have their sentences delayed to give them another chance to attend a meeting			0
if they do , the charges would be dropped			0
at present there is no legislation pending in the state house , @entity89 or @entity13			2
@entity9 was not available for comment thursday .			2

parents of some children in @entity95 schools could be sent to jail for three days
