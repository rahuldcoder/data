@entity0 -- the @entity3 , in a 7 - 2 ruling , upheld @entity5 's use of lethal injection as a means of executing prisoners , ruling that the method -- used in 35 states -- is properly and humanely applied			1
the @entity3 ruled wednesday that @entity5 's use of lethal injection is not " cruel and unusual			1
" at issue was whether the most common method of capital punishment can cause excruciating pain for death row inmates , violating the @entity18 's ban on " cruel and unusual punishment " and thereby giving inmates a proper challenge in court			1
the justices had never directly addressed the fundamental question over the constitutionality of the chemical " cocktail " of drugs used to execute convicted killers			2
all but one of the states that perform executions use the three - drug mixture			1
" @entity5 has adopted a method of execution believed to be the most humane available , " chief justice @entity33 wrote for the majority			1
" if administered as intended , that procedure will result in a painless death			0
" the immediate impact of the ruling is that it will allow states to resume executions , which had been on hold since september while the high court considered this appeal			1
no executions are scheduled in the next few weeks			2
the ruling gives guidance to other states , some of which may have to modify their procedures to fall in line with @entity5 's method and thereby survive judicial scrutiny			1
@entity5 inmates @entity56 and @entity58 brought suit in federal court three years ago , questioning that state 's three - chemical mixture and the procedures used to administer it			1
they claim that the first drug , sodium thiopental , which renders the prisoner unconscious , wears off too quickly and that some prisoners are actually awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues			0
the second drug , pancuronium bromide , paralyzes all muscle movement and then prevents the condemned person from speaking and expressing awareness of pain , according to the suit , and the third drug , potassium chloride , which induces cardiac arrest , is " excruciatingly painful in a conscious person			0
" " we ... agree that petitioners have not carried their burden of showing that the risk of pain from maladministration of a concededly humane lethal injection protocol , and the failure to adopt untried and untested alternatives , constitute cruel and unusual punishment , " @entity33 said			1
his opinion had the support of only two other justices			0
three others agreed with the outcome but wrote separate concurring opinions			0
justices @entity99 and @entity101 dissented			0
@entity99 said @entity5 failed to consider " readily available safeguards " to ensure inmates were not subject to pain			1
she urged the state to revise its procedures , which she suggested might create " an untoward , readily avoidable risk of inflicting severe and unnecessary pain			0
" @entity56 , 52 , admits killing @entity110 county sheriff @entity110 and deputy @entity111 in 1992 while the lawmen were trying to serve him with arrest warrants			0
@entity58 was convicted of killing @entity114 and @entity115 in @entity116 in 1990			0
their 2 - year - old son was wounded in the attack in the couple 's dry cleaning business parking lot			1
@entity58 's lawyers have claimed prosecutorial misconduct and say their client has a low iq			2
state officials have said that their lethal - injection procedures are in line with other states and that a doctor is on site and available to provide any pre-execution medical care to the inmate			1
a @entity135 inmate was put to death the day the high court accepted the @entity5 cases in late september , but since then , the justices have stepped in and imposed a de facto moratorium nationwide			1
only 26 people were executed last year , the lowest total in more than a decade			0
no executions have taken place this year			2
the justices spent nearly six months debating the threshold when execution procedures become unconstitutional			0
both sides of this politically charged national debate were hoping for clear guidelines from the @entity3 to help guide capital inmates and the courts			0
different states and different judges have applied different standards over whether an inmate can make a challenge to the method of execution			2
recent executions in @entity161 and @entity162 were rife with problems , taking much longer than expected when technicians had trouble inserting ivs into the prisoners ' veins			1
the @entity3 ruled in 2006 that prisoners could make last - ditch legal challenges to the method of execution , using claims that they would suffer a painful death			2
" the question before the court was how much risk of unnecessary pain is too much risk of unnecessary pain under the @entity18 , " said @entity174 , an appellate attorney and @entity3 legal analyst			2
" there is evidence to show that this is somewhat of an inhumane way to approach this , but there 's going to be a group of justices who really think we should n't be in the business of micro-managing the death penalty , [ who say ] if state legislatures think that this is ok , that 's going to be fine with us			0
" the case is @entity198 ( 07 - 5439 )			0

7 - 2 ruling , upheld @entity5 's use of lethal injection " cocktail " is constitutional
high court said method -- used in some 35 states -- is not " cruel or unusual "
the immediate impact of ruling is that it will allow states to resume executions
recent lethal injection executions in @entity161 and @entity162 had technical problems
