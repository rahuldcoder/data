@entity0 -- a comprehensive new study identifying the most threatened sea turtle populations worldwide has been published by conservationists			1
the report , jointly produced by the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , @entity8 ( @entity8 ) and the @entity9 's @entity10 , is the first detailed appraisal of global sea turtle populations , say the authors , and will provide a blueprint for future conservation efforts			1
" this assessment system provides a baseline status for all sea turtles from which we can gauge our progress on recovering these threatened populations in the future , " @entity16 , co-chair of the @entity7 and vice-president of @entity8 said in a statement			1
" through this process , we have learned a lot about what is working and what is n't in sea turtle conservation , so now we look forward to turning the lessons learned into sound conservation strategies for sea turtles and their habitats , " @entity16 added			2
almost half of the world 's most threatened sea turtle species can be found in the northern waters of the @entity39 and on nesting beaches lying within @entity41 in countries such as @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , according to the report			1
threatened populations here include both loggerhead turtles ( classified " endangered " by the @entity51 ) and ridley turtles ( " vulnerable " )			0
" the report confirms that @entity43 is a home to many of the most threatened sea turtles in the world , " @entity52 , from the @entity53 said in a statement			2
" this paper is a wake - up call for the authorities to do more to protect @entity43 's sea turtles and their habitats to ensure that they survive , " he added			0
other hotspots for sea turtles include the east @entity67 ( running from the @entity9 to @entity68 ) and the east @entity69 -- specifically off the coast of western @entity71			1
according to the report , threats to sea turtles vary from region to region but can be broadly categorized			2
these include accidental ( caught in fishing nets ) and deliberate targeting ( for trades in eggs , meat and shells ) , coastal development , pollution and climate change			0
join @entity86 for " @entity87 " as well as highlighting danger areas , the report also pinpoints regions which are supporting healthier populations which face relatively low threats			0
species including the hawksbill turtle and the green turtle are thriving in nesting sites and feeding areas in @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , along with southwestern @entity39 , @entity101 ( in @entity102 ) and @entity103			1
the report helps set up " priorities for different populations in different regions , " says @entity108 , director of science for the marine flagship species program at @entity8 and lead author of the report			0
" sea turtles everywhere are conservation - dependent , but this framework will help us effectively target our conservation efforts around the world , " @entity108 said in a statement			0
the report is published in the online science journal @entity121 ( @entity121 ) .			0

new report *reveals* northern @entity39 as area where most sea turtles under threat
report is first comprehensive status assessment of global sea turtle populations
@entity132 also a danger zone for turtles along with east @entity69
@entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 among areas where sea turtles are *fairing* better , report says
