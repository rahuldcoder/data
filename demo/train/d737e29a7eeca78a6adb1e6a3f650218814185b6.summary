-- he came into the final major of the golf season in confident mood but @entity5 was well off the pace after his opening round at the @entity8			1
the world @entity9 , who won his fifth tournament of the 2013 season at the @entity13 last week , had a poor final hole to end the day at 1 - over - par , six strokes off the lead			1
he was tied for 50th along with second - ranked @entity17 , who won last month 's @entity18			1
masters champion @entity19 and @entity20 , 2003 @entity22 champion , shared the lead thursday at 5 - under 65			1
woods , a 14 - time major champion , has gone five years without adding to his collection and started well at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , sitting on 2 - under after 12 holes			2
but a bogey on the fourth hole -- his 13th having started on the 10th -- was added to by a double on his final hole and he slumped to an over-par tally			1
despite his disappointment over the closing clutch of holes , @entity5 was content with his performance			1
" i 'm still right there , " @entity5 told reporters at a press conference			1
" i 'm only six back and we 've got a long way to go			2
" " i played really well			2
i just hit a bad iron shot at four and did n't get up and down			2
" one loose nine iron and ended up not having much of a shot after a decent tee shot on nine			2
i drew no lie at all			2
i did n't even get over the bunker			0
" i made a few par putts out there as well			0
the round realistically could have been under par easily			0
" @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity60 's former world no. 1 @entity61 also had a strong start to the championship , finishing at four - under to be tied for second			1
@entity66 @entity65 and @entity60 's @entity67 were among a group a shot back			0
but @entity5 was , as ever , the main focus of attention on the first day , returning to the course where he produced his second worst display over 72 holes as a professional at the 2003 @entity8			1
he failed to maximize favorable conditions during his morning round			0
" the first hour there was no wind , " @entity5 said			1
" on top of that , with the rain here , it softened everything up			0
that rain certainly helped things			0
" @entity20 took full advantage to record six birdies in his first round , a bogey on the final hole not dampening his enthusiasm			1
" usually disappointed with ending the day on a bogey but 65 at the @entity8 is not so bad , so i 'm feeling pretty good , " @entity20 told reporters			1
" i 'm happy i played a good round , but i 'm wise enough and have been there enough to know it 's only thursday			0
right now we 're jockeying for position			0
" you do n't win the golf tournament on thursday			0
just happy with playing well and putting myself in a good position			0
" defending champion @entity105 was tied for 22nd after carding a 69 , in a big group including the 2011 winner @entity107 of the @entity66 , that year 's @entity18 champion @entity109 and @entity111 's @entity110			2
" i played a really good front nine , " @entity105 told @entity0			0
" a couple of early bogeys halted that momentum but i made a good birdie again on 12			0
i gave myself a couple of chances on the way in , did n't quite take them but to shoot a one - under opening round 69 here is definitely not a bad start			0
" @entity124 , who won his first major title at june 's @entity22 , was tied for 11th on 68 in a group including @entity128 's former world no. 1 @entity127 , @entity111 veteran @entity129 and @entity66 @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 .			1

@entity20 , @entity19 share lead at @entity8
@entity5 endures disappointing day
a double bogey on the final hole leaves one over
world no. 1 tied for 50th with @entity17
