@entity0 , @entity1 in the movie " @entity13 , " which has triggered intensive protests and anger in @entity1 along with @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
the government in @entity1 was the first to announce a public holiday and banned @entity16 as a mark of protest			1
but this failed to calm the violent demonstrations and resulting violent mob actions			0
the country 's big problem is that it suffers from natural disasters , terrorism , crime , poor living conditions and corrupt sociopolitical systems -- but there is little public debate			1
@entity31 , an academician from @entity0 , observed that " the public in @entity1 has remained much oppressed in the past			1
even the genuine issues of society were not allowed to be discussed in public			2
notifications such as ' avoid political conversations ' still may be seen in some public areas			1
" many in @entity1 are seeking to convey a message to the international community by promoting mutual respect for each other 's faiths			1
@entity47 , a @entity48 student , for example says young people must come up with creative ideas to register the hurt feelings that the movie provoked -- but peacefully			0
@entity53 said she applauded @entity55 students who distributed copies of the @entity57 in non-muslim communities			0
in this way , productive ways to register feelings can help in debunking myths about @entity63 and promote it as a religion of peace			2
the present situation is sensitive indeed and can not be dealt with in isolation			0
@entity63 scholars seeking a modest approach should be brought forward on the popular media to calm people 's resentment , while less coverage should be given to more hard - line political parties and public figures			1
@entity77 , from @entity78 , condemns the movie 's offense and its overgeneralized tone			0
for one , the film does not represent popular @entity84 opinion ; second , the @entity84 government has condemned the movie , so burning the @entity84 flag is not necessarily a reasonable reaction			0
furthermore , she believes there are many similarities between @entity93 's @entity92 and @entity63 's @entity5 : they were both open - minded , helped the weak , overcame personal struggles and far more besides			1
the biggest problem in the world today , religiously and culturally , is misunderstanding			1
people on both sides of this situation simply need to take time to learn about one another			0
that becomes almost impossible when one side is making an over-generalized , demeaning movie , and the other side is violently protesting it in an overgeneralized way			0
we need to work to promote positive messages and understanding , above all else			0
read about deadly anti-film protests in @entity1 the question about the nature of protest remains a sensitive one , and it 's far more difficult to motivate people to follow that in practical ways			2
@entity1 youth must realize the differences of mass media usage in @entity84 society and protest in creative , constructive ways to get the desired results , as aggressive protests not only generate more violence and conflict but also make it easy to lose the true spirit of their cause			2
in the present world , human diversity and pluralism must be understood to promote peace and prosperity			2
we need peace and harmony , and to do this we must show tolerance and give space to each other 's differences , be they color , race , creed , religion or nationality in order to promote a friendlier lifestyle around us .			0
