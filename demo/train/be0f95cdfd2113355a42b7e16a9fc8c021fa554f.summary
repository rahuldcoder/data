@entity0 -- former @entity6 head @entity5 may face new sexual assault charges in @entity8 this week , days after charges against him in @entity4 appeared to be on shaky ground			1
in anticipation of those new claims , a lawyer in @entity8 for the former @entity6 chief said he had filed a counterclaim against @entity8 writer @entity15 for " false declarations " after the 32 - year - old journalist and writer alleged that @entity5 assaulted her eight years ago			1
@entity5 's lawyer 's filing was announced shortly after @entity15 's lawyer , @entity21 , said he will file the criminal complaint tuesday with prosecutors , who will determine if there is enough evidence to file charges			1
the legal fireworks came days after questions arose about the truthfulness of a housekeeper who alleged that @entity5 tried to rape her in his @entity4 hotel suite in may			1
asked about @entity15 's allegation , @entity5 's co-counsel @entity32 said in @entity4 , " i do not wish to comment			1
" @entity15 's mother , @entity35 politician @entity34 , said shortly after the housekeeper 's accusations were splashed across front pages around the world that her daughter had been attacked by @entity5 in 2003 but that she had discouraged her at the time from filing charges against him			1
he was never charged in connection with the alleged attack in @entity8 on @entity44			2
@entity34 , a member of parliament , said she cautioned @entity15 not to file a police report at the time for fear it would hurt her journalism career			1
however , in light of the charges against @entity5 , 62 , after the alleged incident at a @entity54 hotel in @entity4 in may , @entity15 's attorney , @entity21 , said a few weeks ago that he and @entity15 were considering filing a complaint			1
@entity21 said the cases were not connected			0
" i do n't see any reason why these two cases should be joined , because either the prosecutor has enough elements to condemn @entity5 in the @entity61 -- and if he does , he should do it -- or he needs to bring two cases together to get a conviction , " he said in june			2
" in that case , we do not want to participate , " he added			2
@entity5 's attorney in @entity8 , @entity68 , did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations in may			1
@entity34 described herself last week as " the woman who embarrasses the @entity73			0
" " i am ... a sort of collateral damage in the @entity5 affair			2
i knew for a long time that my political career was sealed with this bomb , but i did n't imagine that this bitter past could be revived so violently , " she wrote july 1 on the @entity78 website , referring to the alleged attack in @entity4			1
@entity34 recently pulled out of the @entity73 presidential primaries			0
@entity5 had been a front - runner for the party nomination until the @entity4 arrest , and suggestions that the case was foundering have revived talk of his chances in next year 's presidential elections			1
@entity34 said in may that , in 2003 , her journalist daughter had interviewed @entity5 in his office in the @entity95			1
however , after the interview , @entity15 received a text message from @entity5 , saying he was not happy with the interview and asking if he could speak with her again , @entity34 said			1
after @entity15 arrived at the address @entity5 had sent her , he locked the door to the room they were in , took her hand and grabbed her arm , according to @entity34			1
@entity15 told him to let her go , and the incident ended with the two struggling on the floor , @entity34 said			2
@entity15 managed to escape the apartment and locked herself in her car , where she called her mother			2
@entity34 said she arrived about an hour and a half later to find her daughter still locked in the car and looking " roughed up			0
" the heel of one shoe was broken , @entity34 recalled			0
but @entity34 told her daughter not to file a complaint out of concern that she would become known as @entity5 's victim			1
@entity1 does not typically identify sexual assault victims , but @entity34 said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed			0
in @entity4 , the prosecutor 's case against @entity5 has been shaken in recent days after sources revealed that the housekeeper at the @entity54 hotel had been less than truthful with investigators			1
within two days after the alleged attack occurred , she spoke by phone with a boyfriend in an @entity133 jail in a recorded conversation			0
a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity1 that she said that " she 's fine and this person is rich and there 's money to be made , " as originally reported by @entity142			0
the source also said the alleged victim had bank accounts in multiple states			0
" she was getting deposits of several thousands of dollars at a time from people she knew , potentially involved in drug dealing , " the source said			0
the 32 - year - old immigrant has admitted to prosecutors that she lied about her whereabouts following the alleged attack , the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms , according to documents filed in court friday by prosecutors			0
prosecutors said friday that the woman also admitted to lying about being a victim of a gang rape			0
in angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse , the woman 's attorney , @entity163 , acknowledged problems with his client 's credibility , but the bottom line , he said , is that she was attacked			0
" that was true the day it happened , and it is true today , " he said			0
" she has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me			0
and she has never once changed a single thing about that account			0
" the indictment and charges -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- still stand			2
and , though @entity185 is now free to travel in the @entity61 , the judge said authorities has continued to withhold the @entity8 financier 's passport			2
@entity1 's @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
