while @entity5 was celebrating his 26th birthday , the two biggest threats to his hopes of a record seventh @entity4 title were battling to stay in the tournament			2
world no. 1 @entity8 came from two sets down on @entity11 on sunday to salvage his hopes of becoming the first man since @entity14 in 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles			1
on @entity17 , 16 - time grand slam champion @entity16 fought back after losing the first set to a player who idolized him as a child and only gained entry into the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying			1
both advanced to the quarterfinals ahead of @entity5 , who will take on @entity29 13th seed @entity28 on monday			2
jaded no. 1 @entity30 crashes out in @entity31 the last time @entity8 came from two sets down was against @entity16 in the @entity33 semifinals in september , when the @entity34 won his fourth major title			1
since then he has added a third @entity36 to his collection , but his form in 2012 has not reached the stunning heights of last year -- when his 43 - match winning run was ended by the @entity42 veteran in the semifinals at @entity4			2
" i played very badly , but i won thanks to my fighting spirit , " @entity8 said after struggling to beat @entity45 's world no. 25 @entity46 4 - 6 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 3 7 - 5 6 - 3 in more than four hours on sunday			1
" he was the better player for the first two sets and i was fortunate to come through			0
but even at two sets down i still believed i could do it , and that 's about the only positive i can take			0
it was one of those days when nothing worked			0
" @entity46 , appearing in the fourth round of a major for the first time , had won only two sets in losing their seven previous meetings			2
@entity5 ready for first real test at @entity4 @entity8 will next take on either @entity61 fifth seed @entity59 or @entity42 no. 18 @entity62 , having reached the last eight of a grand slam for the 12th consecutive time			1
@entity59 led 6 - 4 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) 3 - 6 3 - 6 4 - 2 in a virtual repeat of his clash with @entity62 last year when play was suspended due to fading light			2
@entity16 is through to his 32nd successive quarterfinal after beating 21 - year - old @entity72 debutant @entity71 5 - 7 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 4			1
the 30 - year - old is now tied with @entity75 @entity74 on 36 last - eight appearances , leaving them second equal overall behind @entity79 ' record of 41			1
he will next take on either @entity82 seventh seed @entity80 or 2009 @entity33 champion @entity83 of @entity29 -- who led 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) 1 - 6 6 - 3 when play was halted long before the @entity59 - @entity62 match , despite appearing to struggle with a strapped - up knee			2
" i thought he played really well			0
great impression , " @entity16 said of his young opponent			0
" he took the ball early every time			0
" he 's got great potential in terms of his touch and the way he reads the game			0
i thought it was an interesting match			0
" @entity71 , who told the crowd after the match that he had pictures of @entity16 on his wall as a child , was ranked 109th in the world when the clay - court tournament started but he will be up to 68th when it ends next sunday			1
he won his first two qualifiers but was beaten in the third before a late reprieve after home hope @entity108 pulled out due to injury			0
" i came out of the qualifiers and i played my best tennis in my first three matches			0
then playing @entity16 was the cherry on the cake , " @entity71 said			1
" i wo n't hide the fact that i had photos of @entity16 everywhere on the walls of my bedroom			0
it was like a dream for me playing him here			0
" @entity71 stunned @entity82 23rd seed @entity126 in the first round proper , then beat more experienced opposition in veteran @entity61 @entity130 -- playing his home tournament for the last time -- and @entity133 's @entity132			1
he was the first lucky loser to reach the last 16 of a grand slam since compatriot @entity136 did so at @entity137 in 1995 .			1

world no. 1 @entity8 rallies from 2 - 0 down to reach @entity4 quarterfinals
@entity34 beats 25th - ranked @entity45 @entity46 in more than four hours at @entity4
third seed @entity16 also comes from behind to beat @entity72 debutant @entity71
@entity16 joins @entity74 on 36 last - eight appearances in grand slam tournaments
