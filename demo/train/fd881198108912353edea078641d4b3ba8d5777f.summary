-- @entity2 and most would first think of the exotic markets of @entity4 , the desert dotted with ancient kasbahs and , of course , the classic 1942 wartime film " @entity8			1
" but @entity8 , the main port city of @entity2 , is among the places being tipped by experts as emerging future global financial centers			1
as the gateway between @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity8 aims to take advantage of its geographical position and also act as a hub for @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity14 , said @entity20 , director of operations and institutional affairs at the @entity22 ( @entity22 )			1
the @entity22 is working hard to position @entity8 as an international financial center , he said , by building its technology infrastructure and improving the legal environment in which business is done			1
@entity20 added that due to @entity2 's many partners throughout @entity13 , @entity28 and @entity29 , for investors " it is easier to do business with @entity33 countries from @entity2			1
" since its inception four years ago , the @entity22 says it has attracted over 50 companies including @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 to name a few			2
while @entity8 's ranking is still relatively low overall ( 62 out of 83 ) in a recent @entity45 report , it 's significant that it debuted on the list and it signals a larger growth in the region			1
what 's more , @entity45 asked international financial services professionals which cities they believed will likely become more significant in the next few years : @entity8 was the name that came up most			1
" they 're putting a lot of work into it there , " said @entity54 , associate director of @entity55 , the company who published the @entity45 report earlier this year on global financial centers			2
" they have a sensible budget and a good team , " he added			0
@entity8 is building its infrastructure and rebranding itself as a hub for financial services needed in @entity2 , @entity70 , and even further away in @entity71 , @entity72			1
" it ( @entity8 ) will be as good as any , " said @entity54			1
another newcomer and fairly unknown city is @entity76 , @entity77 , which has traditionally operated in @entity79 's shadow			1
it ranks 27th on the @entity45 report , just behind number 26 @entity82			0
but it ranks second only to @entity8 as a place tipped by finance professionals as likely become more significant			1
@entity76 has the fifth busiest port in the world , not to mention the largest department store in the world , despite the fact that many people have never even heard of it			2
" @entity76 are putting a great deal of money and promotional activity behind their growth as a financial center , " said @entity54			1
" they are building a dedicated area for the center and are publicizing their focus on maritime finance and derivatives trading			0
" read this : how to start your own currency for different reasons , another @entity29 future contender is @entity108 , @entity109			2
while operating relatively quietly in comparison to its southern neighbor @entity112 , what sets @entity108 apart from others , says @entity115 , managing director and head of corporate and institutional clients for @entity118 , is that it 's quickly becoming a leading financial center for @entity122 banking , which operates with a different set of rules to traditional banking			0
" there is clearly a plan , " said @entity115			0
" it 's not an overnight journey , but the @entity109 have realized to compete with @entity112 and other long - established financial centers , they have the niche in @entity122 banking			0
" @entity122 finance has seen recent growth two to three times faster than conventional banks , according to @entity137 in its @entity138			0
the global financial crisis and strong economic growth in countries with a large @entity143 population are both reasons for such progress			2
unlike neighboring @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity108 stands out as having a more stable political and economic environment			0
@entity115 says the @entity109 government has made great efforts to attract a skilled workforce while at the same time working in a trusted legal environment originating from the @entity154 legal system			0
in the 10 years to 2015 , it is projected that the @entity109 banking industry will have an annual growth rate of approximately 9 % , said @entity115 , and the government has stepped up with various initiatives to promote foreign direct investments into the country , including the @entity162 program which aims to attract talent and build @entity108 into a global city			2
while the @entity165 continues to grow , particularly @entity82 and @entity166 , so do cities in @entity168 , especially if mainland @entity168 's ongoing currency issues around the @entity170 become open and transparent , said @entity54			1
" the wealth there has to go somewhere			0
it 's almost inevitable , " he said , mentioning @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 , as current and future financial hubs			1
in @entity180 , massive growth is happening too , according to the @entity45 report			2
@entity182 , @entity183 , takes the clear lead , jumping 21 places to become 25th on the list despite the economic and political uncertainty in the country			0
@entity54 says that though @entity182 is unpredictable , " the long - term trend will probably be upward			0
" while the same ca n't be said for many continental @entity13 cities			1
@entity193 , for example , saw the biggest drop on the @entity45 list , falling 19 places to number 54			0
@entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , have all seen enormous dips in their rankings since the decline of the @entity204			0
@entity205 , however , is holding strong and tipped to grow due to more lenient tax schemes attractive to companies , said @entity54 , and @entity208 continues its reign as a financial hub thanks to its independence from the @entity204			0
but one point overall , says @entity54 , despite any newcomers on the rise , there are certain ingredients which make cities successful in the rankings and will continue to do so			0
" if you look at the ( current ) top four ( @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity112 ) , they are all very cosmopolitan , welcoming to foreigners , they attract talented expats and they are successful cities and attractive cities , " he said			2
perhaps a note for all cities hoping to climb in the ranks of future financial hubs : " you have to be a successful city in order to be a successful financial center , " said @entity54			1
