rear adm. @entity17 ordered the change as part of the new military strategy in the war that focuses on protecting @entity7 citizens rather than killing militants			1
" indicating the number of insurgents killed has little relevance to impacting the lives of @entity7			2
in fact , if that were the only purpose and metric , you would likely only extend the time it takes to bring about an end to the insurgency , " @entity17 said in an e-mail to @entity1 responding to a query about the change			0
the issue of publishing enemy body counts has been extremely sensitive to the @entity3 military since the @entity41 when the military regularly published large enemy body counts but seemed to be failing overall to make progress in the war			1
in the wars in @entity7 and @entity48 , the @entity46 has shifted policies several times , both publishing numbers in news releases on particular engagements and firefights and also declaring it would not publish body counts			2
in the past some military officials have said the numbers have been part of individual releases to the media as a means of demonstrating success against enemy forces			0
@entity17 said , " we conduct operations not aimed at killing insurgents , although in many instances that is the outcome , but to over time clear areas of insurgency and give the people a chance to reconnect with official forms of governance and to rebuild their lives , socially and economically			0
