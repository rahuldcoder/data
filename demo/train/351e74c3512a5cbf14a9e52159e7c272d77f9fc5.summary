@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 said tuesday it will look into an april 2009 beating of a man by @entity0 , @entity1 , police , an incident that resulted in disciplinary action against two officers but no charges			1
@entity0 mayor @entity11 requested the investigation tuesday , arguing that a federal probe would " help ensure justice is appropriately served			1
" tuesday afternoon , the @entity3 said it would look into the matter , but said little else			1
" as with any allegation that may fall within the @entity3 's purview , the @entity0 office will conduct a review of those events to determine if there is a basis for a federal civil rights investigation , " the bureau said			1
" per @entity3 policy , the @entity25 will not discuss ongoing investigative matters			1
" one of the two police officers involved received a three - day suspension and the other was docked a day 's pay as a result of the incident , according to documents released by @entity0 officials tuesday			1
in a statement released by his office , @entity11 said the video does n't look good " when viewed in isolation , " but that it " tells only a portion of the story			2
" the officers were disciplined for filing false reports after a review by the city 's manager of safety , @entity45			1
but @entity45 said in a letter released tuesday that the statements in their reports stemmed from " more of a misperception " than a " willful , intentional or knowing " attempt to deceive their superiors			2
" viewing the video alone is inflammatory , " @entity45 wrote			2
" however , when the entirety of the situation is reviewed as it should be , i believe i made an appropriate disciplinary decision			2
" despite that finding , the city 's independent monitor is now calling for the officers to be fired			1
" it was clear to me they were trying to cover up what actually happened and make it look better than it was , " said @entity63 , who reviews police internal investigations , told @entity2 affilliate @entity66			2
and @entity73 , the 24 - year - old man seen being taken down and struck in the video footage recorded by a police camera , said monday that he also wants the officers to lose their jobs			1
" i think they should be fired , and if not , prosecuted for assault , " @entity73 said			0
" i think if any one of us had done these actions and assaulted someone , we would all be in jail			0
" the scene was captured by a street surveillance camera located across the intersection from where the beating took place			0
on the video , @entity73 is seen talking animatedly on a mobile phone while police officers kneel over a friend who was being arrested on charges of punching an off - duty officer working security at a bar			1
the friend was being thrown out of the bar when the altercation occurred , according to police reports			0
another officer who responded the fight confronted @entity73 , who was on the phone with his father , a veteran police officer			0
soon afterward , the officer grabs @entity73 by the head and shoves him to the pavement , and the camera pulls away seconds later			0
@entity73 's father , @entity108 , told @entity112 's " @entity111 " that @entity0 police mishandled the situation			0
" officers have so many tools on their belts nowadays , there is no reason to take somebody down the way they did , " said the elder @entity73 , a veteran sheriff 's deputy in southern @entity1 's @entity113			1
he said he could hear sirens in the background while he was on the phone with his son , " so i felt law enforcement was arriving and everything going to be ok , " he said			0
" and then i heard somebody in the background say ' drop the phone , ' and some obscenities			0
the next thing i hear is a thud			0
then @entity73 was not talking anymore , so i knew it was @entity73 that got hit			0
" he said he yelled his son 's name into the phone for about seven minutes , but , " all we could hear was cussing in the background and some thuds			0
" the younger @entity73 had a bloody nose and a cut above his left eye when a police sergeant questioned him after the incident , according to the sergeant 's report			1
he admitted to grabbing police officers he said were struggling with his friend , but denied attempting to punch anyone			1
" i was already handcuffed , and every time i was trying to tell them what happened , they hit me , " he told the sergeant , according to the report			1
and witness statements found both men shoved the police officer seen in the video while they were across the street and out of view of the camera , @entity45 wrote			0
" while there can certainly be debate whether the force was excessive or inappropriate , looking at all available evidence i do not believe excessive or inappropriate force could be proven , " @entity45 added			0
according to @entity66 , charges against @entity73 and a friend at the scene were dropped , and both men received a monetary settlement from the city			1
@entity11 , a @entity176 now running for @entity1 's governor , said it was " appropriate for the independent monitor to question the manager of safety 's decision " in the case			0
" very few cities have this type of check - and - balance system that we have created in @entity0 , " @entity11 's statement said			0
" even still , we are asking for a federal review of the matter			2
" @entity2 's @entity191 contributed to this report .			2
