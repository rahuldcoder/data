@entity0 -- several hundred attempts were made to hack the cellphones of aides to princes @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , the trial of two of @entity12 's former senior executives has heard			1
a @entity16 " private wire " -- which routed desk - based landlines through a mobile phone number -- was used 296 times by @entity16 private investigator @entity15 in an attempt to access phone messages of @entity19 , the heir to the @entity22 throne 's private secretary , detective constable @entity13 told the @entity27 court on thursday			1
and between october 2005 and august 2006 there were 416 attempts to hack the voicemail of @entity31 , private secretary to princes @entity7 and @entity8			1
the claims were made in the trial of former @entity36 editors @entity37 and @entity38 , who are accused of conspiring between october 2000 and august 2006 " to intercept communications in the course of their transmission , without lawful authority			1
" they deny the charges			0
other former employees of the tabloid , which closed down in 2011 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 , are accused with them			0
@entity51 , @entity52 and @entity49 have pleaded guilty			0
@entity15 was convicted of phone hacking in 2006 , and has already pleaded guilty to hacking charges in the current case			2
earlier jurors were shown whiteboards taken from @entity15 's office and home that featured telephone numbers , mobile phone networks ' passwords and names , such as tennis player @entity65 and @entity37 , @entity67 ' maiden name			1
the boards contained messages to avoid certain members of staff who worked for mobile phone networks			1
at the start of the trial jurors were played a tape of @entity15 obtaining pin numbers from mobile phone providers by pretending to be someone else such as an engineer , a practice known as " blagging			1
" giving evidence in the trial , @entity13 said voicemail messages could be intercepted easily in the early part of last decade			2
asked by the prosecution if this was due to a security failure of mobile phone network providers , @entity13 said : " i 'd agree they were clearly not sufficient			1
" @entity91 guide earlier in the day @entity13 gave jurors an insight into how to hack a mobile phone			1
the first way was to dial the cellphone number of the target ; if it was engaged or turned off then the phone would go to voicemail			0
you could interrupt a greeting , @entity13 said , by pressing the * , # or 9 keys and listen to messages by entering a default pin code , such as 3333 or 1010 depending on which @entity22 phone network the hacking target was on as many users rarely changed these			2
if the hacker called the same number with two phones , the first call would make the line " engaged " putting the second call straight to voicemail			0
the first phone could even be set to terminate the call before the target was aware that they had been called			0
an alternative was to dial a number that directly accessed a person 's voicemail , @entity13 said			0
the hacker could then access messages by entering a code ; again these were often not changed from the cellphone 's original default setting			0
as well as being accused of conspiring to intercept communications , @entity67 , @entity38 , @entity48 , @entity129 , @entity51 and @entity15 face an additional charge of intercepting the voice mail messages of @entity22 schoolgirl @entity133 , who went missing and was later found murdered in 2002			1
@entity67 , her husband , @entity137 , and her former personal assistant @entity138 also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking			0
they were charged in may 2012 , along with @entity67 ' former driver , a security guard and members of security staff from @entity16 -- the then parent company of @entity36 -- with attempting to pervert the course of justice			2
the hacking scandal prompted @entity22 prime minister @entity153 to set up an independent inquiry , led by @entity155 , to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public , police and politicians			2
the trial resumes on wednesday .			0
