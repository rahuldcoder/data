-- the chances you 'll die from heart disease are good -- too good			1
heart disease is the leading cause of death for @entity6			1
it 's especially of concern for women , since symptoms can be different from those seen in men , according to the @entity13			0
the good news is , you have a tremendous ability to keep yourself from becoming a sad statistic			0
here are five simple things you can do to take better care of your ticker			0
get some zzz 's you need seven to eight hours a night to be well - rested			1
sleep is not just downtime			1
it 's when your brain forms new pathways to help your memory			0
it 's when your heart and vascular system get a break , as your blood pressure and heart rate slow down			1
if you do n't get enough sleep , your body constantly produces adrenaline and stress hormones to keep you awake			1
that means your blood pressure and heart rate does n't slow down as well , and that hurts your heart			1
your sleeping body also produces cytokines , which helps your immune system fight infections and chronic inflammation			0
studies show poor sleep -- anything less than six hours -- hurts women more than it does men			2
get active ( yes , including sex ! ) any kind of exercise is essential for your heart , including sex , studies show			1
" my guess is the ' get more sex ( suggestion ) ' was published by a man , " dr. @entity58 joked			0
but the @entity64 cardiologist admits she has " written on my prescription pad that a patient should have more chocolate , sex and coffee			0
" all of those , in moderation , are good for stress relief , she said			2
studies do show that sex is a significant form of exercise			2
@entity58 recommends you get at least 30 minutes a day of moderate - intensity exercise whether it is at the gym , in your neighborhood or even in your bedroom			1
something as simple as walking counts -- " as long as when i call you on the cell phone i can tell by your breathing that you are exercising , " @entity58 said			0
" you ca n't just be on a stroll window shopping			0
" exercise lowers your blood pressure , helps you lose weight , increase your good cholesterol ( @entity91 ) , reduces your bad cholesterol ( @entity93 ) and increases your insulin sensitivity			2
only about 20 % of @entity6 adults meet the minimum standard for exercise recommended by the federal government , according to the @entity99			1
that standard is 2Â½ hours a week of moderate aerobic exercise like walking or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise like jogging			2
being overweight is also hard on your heart , so if you want to lose weight aim for 60 to 90 minutes of exercise a day , according to dr. @entity106 , a cardiologist at @entity107 in @entity108			1
" i tell my patients you should have a @entity111 that 's less than 25 and a waist that measures less than 35			0
that 's pretty specific , but that 's what you need for a healthy heart , " @entity113 said			2
raise a glass -- and maybe a carrot -- to your heart a drink a day can keep the heart doctor away			2
if you do drink ( do n't start for a healthier heart ) , @entity58 suggests one alcoholic beverage is enough ( for the guys it 's two )			2
any more can stress your heart			1
a drink , by the way , is not an extra-large tumbler			0
it 's 12 ounces of beer , 4 ounces of wine , 1.5 ounces of 80 - proof spirits or 1 ounce of 100 - proof spirits			1
this is not just limited to red wine , which does have heart - healthy antioxidants			1
there is evidence to suggest a drink can increase levels of " good " cholesterol and protect against artery damage			0
alcohol can also help you relax			0
eating healthy is also essential -- watch refined sugar , salt and fat and eat lots of fruits and vegetables ( in the 4.5 cup range )			0
keep a close eye on salt			0
most @entity6 eat too much and over 75 % of it comes from packaged foods or from eating out			1
the @entity157 for @entity6 suggest limiting salt to less than 2,300 miligrams per day -- that 's about 1 teaspoon			1
@entity113 also tells her patients to keep a healthy heart diet high in omega - 3 fatty acids like what you find in fish			1
do n't let your doctor be lonely get screened for heart disease			1
regular screening can catch risks early and prevent problems down the road			0
the kind of tests you need depend on your age , how much exercise you get , how great your diet is and your family history ( if your parents or brothers and / or sisters have heart problems , you 're at risk )			1
the @entity13 suggests everyone start monitoring heart health by age 20			2
your doctor should check your blood pressure , your weight and your cholesterol and triglyceride levels			0
high blood pressure greatly increases your chance of having heart problems			2
if your blood pressure is above 120/80mm , you may want more regular checks			0
blood pressure can be controlled through medication or a better diet and exercise			1
starting at age 45 , get your blood glucose levels checked			0
high blood glucose levels -- a sign of type 2 diabetes -- can lead to heart disease and stroke			1
you may also want a more comprehensive heart screening			2
at @entity210 where @entity58 works , a typical heart screening involves all the tests you should have in your 20s			2
a @entity111 test is performed and your waist circumference measured			0
the electrical activity in your heart is monitored , and you 'll undergo what 's called a carotid intima - media thickness test			1
essentially , the two major arteries in your neck are screened for signs of hardening ( an early sign of disease )			2
a carotid and peripheral arterial disease screening looks for blockages in your legs , neck and arms			0
your blood sugar is measured , your lipid profiles are tested and your cholesterol checked			0
" we do a lot of sick care in medicine these days , " @entity58 said			0
" i think we need to be more aggressive and look for potential problems before they happen because what we generally have now is n't enough			0
" for women , it 's especially important to know the signs of heart trouble , as they can differ from symptoms in men			0
instead of the classic chest pain with exertion , women may experience this pain while resting or have a sensation in their neck or jaw -- or classic symptoms that can be confused with gastro - intestinal disease			1
" women are so busy taking care of everyone else they put themselves last , but they have to take care of themselves when it comes to their heart , " @entity113 said			0
quit smoking " this is no. 1 on my list , " @entity58 said , and @entity113 agreed			1
@entity58 said when she sees a young patient who has a heart attack , 90 % of them admit to being smokers			1
it 's a little known fact , but most smokers die from heart disease long before they 'll get lung cancer			1
there are fewer smokers these days , according to the @entity99 but the number of women who quit has plateaued			0
smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in the @entity6			1
it tends to create blood clots , decreases your levels of good cholesterol , makes it harder to exercise and can raise your blood pressure temporarily .			0

heart disease is the no. 1 *killer* of @entity6
heart disease can be prevented with diet , exercise , sleep and stress - reduction
smoking is one of the leading causes of heart disease in young *people*
