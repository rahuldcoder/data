two hours before the official results of the @entity4 presidential elections , no @entity1 visitor could ignore that a historical political change was about to happen			1
down @entity1 ' @entity10 boulevards , throngs of flag - waving young and not - so - young people were flocking towards the @entity12 headquarters near the @entity13			0
cyclists were ringing their bells , cars blowing their horns and @entity19 's sympathizers chanting " @entity20 ! " @entity21 had just canceled a planned celebration at @entity23 and the place , where the guillotine once stood , was alarmingly quiet and deserted			1
however , as is traditional in presidential elections , @entity4 waited for the traditional countdown at 8 p.m. sharp to see the face of their next president and to start celebrating or commiserating			1
with 51.7 % of the votes , the socialist candidate @entity19 won a neat victory , albeit not a large one			2
his first few hours as president struck a different tone to @entity21 's victory in 2007			1
he addressed the nation from @entity38 , his regional bastion in the heart of @entity4 , and his speech was then followed by accordionists playing " @entity43			2
" he then hopped in a modest - looking car to reach the nearest airport and fly to @entity1 to go straight to the @entity46 where 100,000 people waited until after midnight to hear him speak again			0
no flashy restaurant on the @entity50 , no celebrities behind him , no cortege of expensive cars : @entity19 appeared as mr. @entity54 from the first few minutes of his election			1
here lies perhaps the key to his election			0
unlike the rest of @entity58 , where governments collapsed under the euro crisis 's burden , the @entity4 did n't sanction @entity21 for his management of the financial crisis , which in fact many consider good			1
they ousted @entity21 on his personality			1
in the last five years , they had grown to detest the man even more than his policies			0
the tv debate which traditionally puts the two candidates against each other just before the second round of the elections and which was followed by 18 million people showed the two men 's strikingly different styles			2
@entity21 appeared as the never - ending attacker who always tried to push his rival into mistakes			1
@entity19 looked a much calmer presence who excelled both in ducking blows and holding his ground			2
if the street celebrations lasted till dawn in the streets of @entity4 , however , the honeymoon should n't last very long for @entity19 , who was already on the phone to @entity91 chancellor @entity90 an hour after being elected			1
first , he must reassure the markets while pushing for a growth pact alongside the already negotiated fiscal pact			0
he may not even wait for the traditional week before the official handover to start his presidency			0
his agenda for the next few days and weeks looks extremely busy			0
on may 17 , @entity19 must meet president @entity99 in @entity100			2
the two men have never met and @entity19 is an unknown entity in the @entity103 the following two days , on may 18 and 19 , @entity19 will attend the @entity104 at @entity105 and then on to the @entity107 summit in @entity108 , where the @entity4 president will announce the earlier withdrawal of @entity4 troops from @entity112 , an announcement which should not please the @entity103 administration and @entity107 allies			1
in @entity4 , the next hurdle will come in a month when the newly elected president will ask the @entity4 to give him a clear majority at the @entity13			1
a large majority would give the socialist government room for maneuvering and real legitimacy when dealing with other @entity58 partners			0
at the @entity46 yesterday , @entity19 stated very clearly his intent to spear a new anti-austerity movement in @entity58 and the world at large			2
he must first convince @entity90 to let the @entity128 play a bigger part in the euro 's recovery			0
will @entity19 succeed where @entity21 failed ? it is possible , after all			1
@entity90 and @entity19 may belong to two different political families ; this detail alone never derailed the formidable entente between @entity137 and @entity138			0
besides , @entity19 does n't need being convinced that @entity91 is @entity4 's most important ally			1
in 2007 , @entity21 very openly snubbed @entity90 , by looking instead towards the @entity103 and @entity140			0
only circumstances made him reconsider			0
@entity142 was never a natural duo			0
at home , @entity19 will start by making a few symbolic gestures : lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 for a fraction of the workforce , specifically those who started working in their mid-teens ; he will raise students ' scholarships ; and stop the haemorrhage of teachers in the education sector , in his eyes , the most important battleground in @entity4 and the key to its future			1
these decisions are not going to deepen the public deficit much ; they will however go a long way to signify that @entity163 is now extinct			0
and it is precisely what a majority of @entity4 people want to hear at present .			2

@entity19 appeared as mr. @entity54 from first few minutes of his election , says @entity170
she says @entity4 did n't oust @entity21 over financial crisis ; they ousted @entity21 on his personality
@entity19 faces big challenge : firstly in *parliamentary* elections in a month when he seeks majority
he does n't need to be convinced that @entity91 is @entity4 's most important ally , @entity170 says
