-- electroshock therapy today bears little resemblance to its lurid depictions in @entity5 dramas like " @entity6			0
" for decades psychiatrists have used shock therapy to treat cases of depression that have n't been helped by antidepressant medications , and in recent years the treatment -- now known as electroconvulsive therapy ( @entity14 ) -- has experienced something of a revival			1
roughly 100,000 people in the @entity18 now receive it each year			1
the future of @entity14 is in doubt , however			1
on thursday , a @entity23 ( @entity23 ) advisory panel will meet to consider whether the machines used in @entity14 should be more tightly regulated than they are now			1
if the advisory panel votes for more oversight -- and if the @entity23 follows the panel 's advice , as it usually does -- some experts fear that access to the treatment will be curtailed			1
@entity0 : hysteria , demons , and more : depression throughout history @entity14 machines are currently in a strictly controlled category of medical devices that includes pacemakers and prosthetic joints			1
as with prescription drugs , devices in this class must be approved by the @entity23 before they can be used on patients			1
but because @entity14 devices were already in use when the @entity23 put those rules in place about 35 years ago , they were exempted from the approval process			1
the @entity23 is now revisiting the status of the devices			1
the agency can leave @entity14 devices in their current class and require manufacturers to provide evidence of safety and effectiveness , which may entail new clinical trials and could temporarily limit the devices ' use			1
or it can rely on existing evidence and reclassify the devices to a less restrictive category that includes ultrasound machines , motorized wheelchairs , and contact - lens solution			0
that option would give @entity14 devices a pass and ensure that they remain available to doctors			2
the impending @entity23 action has reawakened the debate surrounding this controversial treatment for depression and other mental disorders			1
more than 1,500 organizations and individuals have filed formal comments with the @entity23			2
@entity0 : 10 things to say ( and not say ) to someone with depression the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) and scores of individual psychiatrists have expressed support for permanently easing the restrictions on @entity14 devices , because they worry that manufacturers of @entity14 devices may lack the funds , time , or motivation to meet new @entity23 requirements ( by conducting new research , for instance )			1
" it may be a major disaster , " says @entity94 , @entity95 , a professor emeritus of psychiatry and neurology at @entity98 , in @entity99 , who researched and performed @entity14 for 45 years			2
" if they want an extensive review of safety and efficacy , that means somebody has to pay for it			0
it becomes a very expensive proposition and there is nobody to do it unless the government supports it			0
the manufacturers are all small companies in the @entity18 there 's no @entity118 for @entity14 devices			1
" on the other side , patients ' rights organizations and advocacy groups such as the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) have urged the @entity23 not to hastily reclassify @entity14 devices			1
those groups argue that the treatment and the potential side effects -- such as memory loss and brain damage -- are serious enough to merit a thorough review			1
@entity0 : 7 types of therapy that can help depression and for good measure , the @entity133 and related anti-psychiatry groups have joined the fray , calling for an outright ban on @entity14 and flooding the @entity23 with comments that call the treatment " barbaric , " " evil , " and " criminal			1
" the evolution of shock therapy @entity14 was first used on a human patient in @entity144 in 1938 , after preliminary experiments in dogs and pigs			2
the treatment involves delivering electric currents to the brain in order to induce a seizure , which , in turn , seems to alleviate depression			0
( no one knows exactly how @entity14 works			2
) early ect treatments were more primitive than those used today , and in some cases they did cause harm to patients , including memory loss , burns from the electrodes placed on the patient 's skull , and bone fractures resulting from violent muscle contractions during the seizure			0
these grisly scenes are now a thing of the past , advocates of the treatment say , thanks to improvements in devices and protocols			0
" we have not had an injury of any kind from @entity14 in years , " dr. @entity94 says			2
an @entity14 session generally lasts no more than 10 to 20 minutes , and the bulk of that time is spent waiting for the general anesthesia to kick in and wear off			2
the electrical current is on for a few seconds or less , and the seizure lasts for about 20 to 60 seconds , says @entity184 , @entity95 , director of geriatric psychiatry at @entity186 's @entity185 , in @entity99			0
@entity0 : what @entity14 feels like the procedure is relatively drama - free			2
general anesthesia tends to shorten the seizures , and doctors now give patients muscle relaxants that reduce spasms and even " visible movement , " says dr. @entity184 , who ran @entity186 's @entity195 for 15 years			0
the placement of the electrodes has also been refined , making @entity14 much safer , according to @entity198 , @entity95 , the @entity83 's associate director of research			2
" @entity14 does not cause brain damage , " dr. @entity184 says			2
" memory loss today is very limited in most cases , and the loss is patchy and primarily for events during and just before and following the @entity14 course			0
so the patient may not remember one of the nurses on the ward but will recognize the other nurses			0
" the treatment is very effective in the short term , dr. @entity198 says			0
roughly 80 % to 95 % of patients experience a full remission from their depression symptoms , he estimates , although some patients need repeat sessions to keep their severe depression from coming back			0
and unlike antidepressants , which can take weeks to kick in , some patients start experiencing improvement after their first one or two ect treatments			0
@entity0 : 10 surprising facts about antidepressants a charged debate in 2009 , the @entity226 , which investigates and audits government agencies , urged the @entity23 to lift the grandfather clause that exempted @entity14 devices ( and many other types of devices ) from the @entity23 approval process			1
disability and mental health advocates welcomed this development as an opportunity for @entity14 to receive a long - overdue review of its safety and effectiveness			1
if the devices are reclassified , on the other hand , " the rigorous scientific safety investigation of these devices may never take place -- preventing patients from making informed choices about their treatment , " the @entity122 wrote in a 2009 letter to the @entity23			1
but the @entity83 and other supporters of reclassification claim that @entity14 has been researched enough to address these concerns			0
" we have a growing body of evidence to support the fact that @entity14 is safe and effective , " dr. @entity198 says			0
" we think it would be a waste of money and effort to go through a new application process , because the amount of research that 's already been done in the past 30 years is so great			0
" @entity262 , the legal director of @entity263 , one of many independent statewide disability agencies that have lined up against the reclassification of @entity14 devices , questions the quality of the existing research			0
" there are concerns about who 's done [ the ] studies and whether they are , in fact , appropriate scientific studies or whether they 're pushed by the @entity83 or pushed by manufacturers , " @entity262 says			0
" we 're calling into question ... whether the studies are , in fact , unbiased studies			0
" the @entity23 's neurological devices advisory panel is scheduled to discuss @entity14 devices on january 27 and 28			1
an official decision from the @entity23 will come later			0

roughly 100,000 people in the @entity18 now receive @entity14 each year

*critics* say treatment and potential side effects are serious enough to merit review
