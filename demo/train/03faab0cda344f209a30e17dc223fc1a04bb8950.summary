@entity0 -- @entity2 checked into a @entity4 rehab center early friday , ending -- at least for now -- a drama that has had more twists and turns than a high - speed car chase			1
@entity9 , the lawyer who guided @entity2 through years of legal turmoil until the actress abruptly fired her in january , helped her avoid jail once again by brokering a deal , her father told @entity1 friday			1
" i am so thankful to @entity9 and @entity15 , her manager , for doing this , " @entity14 said			0
while he would n't name the @entity4 facility his daughter entered , he noted it is a rehab program she 's been in before			2
the actress underwent three months of court - ordered substance abuse rehab at the @entity24 at the end of 2010 , but she was in legal trouble again weeks later -- facing a shoplifting charge that led to her current woes			1
@entity2 , 26 , " wants to settle in " for a few days while arrangements can be made to transfer her to the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , which bills itself as a " luxury rehab center , " @entity14 said			1
" the @entity31 is where she wanted to go all along -- a place she will get the right treatment and finally get better , " @entity14 said			0
@entity39 city attorney @entity38 , who must approve any transfer , has not responded to @entity1 calls for comment			0
the actress was supposed to start a 90 - day stint in a " lockdown " rehab center thursday , an alternative to a three - month jail term for two misdemeanor convictions and a shoplifting probation violation finding in march			1
but she abruptly left the @entity4 facility where she had gone thursday morning because " she was not happy with the place , " her father said			1
@entity14 said he was not happy with it either because of the revelation that the facility -- @entity56 in @entity57 -- ca n't provide alcohol and drug rehab treatments because @entity4 officials revoked its license			0
" if a 24 - hour residential facility is providing treatment or services to promote the recovery of alcohol and drug abuse then they must possess a license , " said @entity62 , deputy director for the @entity63			0
none of @entity56 's several locations in @entity4 are licensed , @entity62 said			0
the company previously had three licenses , but all were revoked			0
the state 's licensing agency is in litigation with @entity56 's unlicensed @entity57 facility , she said			0
it 's unclear whether @entity84 judge @entity83 knew @entity56 was unlicensed when @entity2 's lawyer , @entity85 , informed him in court thursday morning that she would spend her rehab sentence there			1
@entity38 objected at thursday 's hearing , saying @entity85 did n't get prior approval for @entity2 to go to @entity56			1
@entity38 said he needed time to investigate it			0
" @entity2 had no idea that @entity56 was n't approved , " @entity14 said			2
@entity85 has not respond to several @entity1 requests for comment			0
the judge ordered the treatment after @entity2 entered pleas of no contest on charges relating to a traffic accident and , with those convictions , she was found in violation of her shoplifting probation			1
her six years of legal troubles trace back to two drunken driving arrests in 2007 and include other incidents in which she was behind the wheel			0
@entity2 was charged with reckless driving and lying to a police officer about a june 2012 car crash in which her @entity111 hit a dump truck on the @entity113 in @entity39 , @entity4			2
her arrest triggered the probation violation charge			0
the police report said @entity2 denied being behind the wheel , but the prosecutor was expected to call witnesses who say she was driving			2
@entity2 acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances			2
she 's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since january 2007 , including one long court - ordered stint after a failed drug test			1
the actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four @entity0 judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail			2
@entity2 has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the @entity0 jail , served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue .			1
