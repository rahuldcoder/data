in case you have n't read " @entity4 , " it 's widely recognized as dr. @entity6 ' take on environmentalism and how humans are destroying nature			1
loggers were so upset about the book that some groups within the industry sponsored " @entity15 , " a similar book -- but from the logging point of view			2
dr. @entity6 ' widow , @entity6 , accepted his star on the @entity18 in 2004			1
another interesting fact : the book used to contain the line , " i hear things are just as bad up in @entity25 , " but 14 years after the book was published , the @entity19 wrote to @entity6 creator @entity6 , and told him how much the conditions had improved and implored him to take the line out			1
@entity6 agreed and said that it would n't be in future editions			1
somehow , @entity6 's books find themselves in the middle of controversy			1
the line " a person 's a person , no matter how small , " from " @entity39 , " has been used as a slogan for anti-abortion organizations			2
it 's often questioned whether that was @entity6 ' intent in the first place , but when he was still alive , he threatened to sue an anti-abortion group unless they removed his words from their letterhead			1
@entity47 , the attorney for dr. @entity6 ' interests and for his widow , @entity6 , says that she does n't like people to " hijack dr. @entity6 characters or material to front their own points of view			1
" @entity0 : 5 stories about @entity6 himself 3			1
" @entity60 , " published in 1950 , is the first recorded instance of the word " nerd			2
" @entity64 " was written because dr. @entity6 thought the famous @entity62 and @entity63 primers were insanely boring			1
because kids were n't interested in the material , they were n't exactly compelled to use it repeatedly in their efforts to learn to read			0
so , " @entity64 " was born			1
@entity70 , dr. @entity6 ' editor , bet him that he could n't write a book using 50 words or less			1
" @entity64 " was pretty simple , after all , and it used 225 words			2
not one to back down from a challenge , mr. @entity6 started writing and came up with " @entity76 " -- which uses exactly 50 words			1
the 50 words , by the way , are : a , am , and , anywhere , are , be , boat , box , car , could , dark , do , eat , eggs , fox , goat , good , green , ham , here , house , i , if , in , let , like , may , me , mouse , not , on , or , rain , @entity91 , say , see , so , thank , that , the , them , there , they , train , tree , try , will , with , would , you			2
it 's often alleged that " @entity101 " was written specifically about @entity97 , but the book came out only two months after the whole @entity100 scandal			2
it 's unlikely that the book could have been conceived of , written , edited and mass produced in such a short time			2
also , @entity6 never admitted that the story was originally about @entity97			2
that 's not to say he did n't understand how well the two flowed together			0
in 1974 , he sent a copy of @entity101 to his friend @entity110 at the @entity111			0
in it , he crossed out " @entity101 " and replaced it with " @entity97 , " which @entity110 reprinted in its entirety			0
" @entity117 " = @entity118 ? yep			0
if you have n't read the story , here 's a little overview : yertle is the king of the pond , but he wants more			0
he demands that other turtles stack themselves up so he can sit on top of them to survey the land			0
@entity131 , the turtle at the bottom , is exhausted			0
he asks @entity117 for a rest ; yertle ignores him and demands more turtles for a better view			0
eventually , @entity117 notices the moon and is furious that anything dare be higher than himself , and is about ready to call for more turtles when @entity131 burps			0
this sudden movement topples the whole stack , sends yertle flying into the mud , and frees the rest of the turtles from their stacking duty			0
dr. @entity6 actually said @entity117 was a representation of @entity118			1
despite the political nature of the book , none of that was disputed at @entity154 -- what was disputed was @entity131 's burp			2
no one had ever let a burp loose in a children 's book before , so it was a little dicey			0
in the end , obviously , @entity131 burped			0
@entity0 : the dr. @entity6 quiz 8			1
" @entity171 " is one i had never heard of , perhaps with good reason : it was pulled from the shelves of libraries for a while because of the reference to the @entity169 and the arms race			0
@entity172 and @entity173 are societies who do everything differently			0
the @entity172 eat their bread with the butter - side up and the @entity173 eat their bread with the butter - side down			0
obviously , one of them must be wrong , so they start building weapons to outdo each other : the " @entity185 , " the " @entity186 , " the " @entity187 , " the " @entity188 " , the " eight - @entity189 , " the " @entity190 " and the " @entity191			0
" the book concludes with each side ready to drop their ultimate bombs on each other , but the reader does n't know how it actually turns out			0
" oh the places you 'll go " is the final @entity6 book published before he passed away			1
published in 1990 , it sells about 300,000 copies every year because so many people give it to college and high school grads			0
no dr. @entity6 post would be complete without a mention of " how the @entity209 stole @entity210 ! " @entity211 himself , @entity213 , provided the voice of the @entity209 and the narration for the movie			1
@entity6 was a little wary of casting him because he thought his voice would be too scary for kids			1
if you 're wondering why they sound a bit different , it 's because the sound people went back to the @entity209 's parts and removed all of the high tones in @entity213 's voice			1
that 's why the @entity209 sounds so gravelly			2
@entity231 , aka @entity229 , is the voice behind " @entity233 , mr. @entity209			1
" he received no credit on screen , so dr. @entity6 wrote to columnists in every major @entity238 newspaper to tell them exactly who had sung the song			1

dr. @entity6 wrote " @entity64 " because of bet over 50 - word book
@entity213 is voice of main character in " how the @entity209 stole @entity210 ! "
*author* agreed to remove *negative* line about @entity25 from " @entity4 "
