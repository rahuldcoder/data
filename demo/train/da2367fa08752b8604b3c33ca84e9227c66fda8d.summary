he 's been dubbed the " secretary of defense , " but do n't expect @entity2 to be repelling @entity3 forwards any time soon			1
the 35 - year - old says he intends to end his club career at @entity7 , the club he first joined on loan in 2006			1
@entity2 has been a mainstay in goal for the @entity12 team and if not for a back injury two years ago , likely would have matched -- and exceeded -- @entity15 's @entity7 record of consecutive league appearances			1
he signed a contract extension until 2018 with the club last april			2
" it 's the club that i love , " the ex @entity20 standout told @entity0			2
" it 's been a brilliant relationship with myself and the chairman and both managers -- and with the fans			0
" it 's a place where i can achieve the things i want to achieve and push myself every day and i am still hungry for the game			0
" all of the questions i have been looking for in my career have been answered here			0
so i think i would like to finish here and then be done			0
" i 'm living the good life here at @entity7 and i do n't think i really need to change the scenery			1
" but that does n't mean @entity2 plans on missing out on the 2018 @entity36 in @entity37			1
@entity2 is taking a break from the national team this season to spend more time with his two @entity43 - based children though is hoping to return to @entity45 's side and reclaim the starting position from @entity48 's @entity47			1
@entity2 sparkled for the @entity43 at the most recent @entity36 in @entity49 last year , especially against @entity50 in the round of 16 when he made a tournament record 15 saves			1
he was even congratulated by @entity43 president @entity54 and earned the nickname , " secretary of defense			1
" " i was physically strong and mentally i felt motivated to continue and so to be quite honest -- i miss it , " he said of his international sabbatical			0
" i do n't know how it 's going to end but my plan is to certainly be part of a @entity43 team that qualifies for @entity37 and to be in @entity37 and be part of that team			1
" how it works with selection and my standing within the team , it 's hard to say this far out			0
but my passion , my drive is to be there , then fly home and finish -- go to the beach			0
" a calf injury ruled @entity2 out of the @entity7 lineup for nearly two months before he returned last week in a 1 - 0 loss at @entity80			1
he insisted that talk of relegation -- @entity7 stands 12th , five points above the drop zone -- was " nonsense			2
" @entity7 , some would say , overachieved under @entity87 last season in finishing fifth			2
talking of managers , @entity2 has n't forgotten the man who signed him , @entity90			1
the @entity91 did n't last a season when he replaced @entity94 legend @entity93 at @entity95 but is now having success in @entity97 with @entity98			2
" when @entity93 left i think there was a lot of people probably in the media ( licking their ) chops , excited for and looking for the slaughter that was about to come -- that was impending because unless the next manager came in and was absolutely perfect that was what was going to happen , " said @entity2 , who moved to @entity7 from @entity94			1
" @entity90 is one hell of a tough character			2
if anyone can withstand that and brush it off and move on it 's him			0
" he has the ability to motivate men like nothing i have ever seen			0
i have spoken with him since he 's been in @entity97			0
he 's an incredible human being			0
the way he treats his players is fantastic			0

@entity2 intends on ending his club career at @entity7
but he is looking forward to returning to the @entity43 national team
@entity2 still keeps in touch with former @entity7 boss @entity90
