" it is time for a new direction			0
a lot of fans today have grown up and they have only known mr. @entity1 as head of @entity2 , or head of the administration of @entity2 , so i think change is not the wrong thing			1

what is missing , and lacking , is transparency which over the years we could not provide to the public			0

" i do n't think people were happy about @entity61 winning the right to host 2018			0
now is not the time to cry about something that happened in the past			0
let us hope the future is going to be more transparent and more open for the public			0
