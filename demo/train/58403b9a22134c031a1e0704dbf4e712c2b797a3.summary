@entity0 -- protests swelled in cities nationwide friday as police forces struggled to either corral or remove demonstrators from downtown parks and plazas in the latest development of the monthlong @entity10 movement			1
scores of protesters were arrested in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity0 , though reports of violence were rare			1
@entity1 @entity18 sent in photos and video from " occupy " protests across several @entity23 cities			0
in @entity15 , @entity1 affiliate @entity26 broadcast images of police detaining demonstrators as they gathered amid tents and tarps strewn about a downtown plaza			1
protesters appeared to refuse to leave the area , sitting in columns atop the plastic tarps and yelling " stay down " as police tried to remove them from the scene			1
at one point , police used pepper spray to break up the crowd			1
" we understand people have a right to protest ( but ) , somewhere along the line , people have a right to conduct business , " @entity15 police chief @entity43 told @entity1 affiliate @entity44			1
police eventually removed tents that had been set up by protestors and cleared the area by late afternoon			1
in @entity13 , authorities said 24 people were arrested as @entity1 affiliate @entity58 aerial video of police detaining protesters in a downtown section of the city			1
@entity64 spokesman @entity63 said the demonstrators could be identified as two distinct groups : the first was a part of what he described as the local " @entity10 " group , which maintained close communication with law enforcement during the demonstration			1
the second , he said , was a more " radical " faction			0
" these were the ones ( police ) came into trouble with today , " @entity63 said			1
most of those arrested in @entity13 were charged with unlawful conduct on state property , he said , while one other person was charged with simple assault			1
another protester was arrested for impeding traffic			1
in @entity14 , police in riot gear rounded up and arrested 41 demonstrators who gathered in a city park , said police spokeswoman @entity92			1
in @entity0 , deputy police commissioner @entity94 said law officers arrested 14 demonstrators after they sat in roadways to block traffic , overturned trash bins , knocked over a police scooter and hurled bottles			1
@entity103 student @entity102 , who attended friday 's protest in @entity106 's financial district , shot video of at least one demonstrator being taken to the ground by police			1
the video captures a police officer pressing his night stick against the back of the protester 's neck during the arrest			1
the man is seen face down on the pavement			0
he can be heard screaming after what @entity102 described as an earlier incident in which the man 's leg was allegedly run over by a police motorcycle			1
" i saw a number of other people being shoved or pushed with batons , " @entity102 said			2
" i saw another officer punching people			2
" @entity0 police disputed the claim that the man had been run over by a police vehicle			1
independent witnesses from the @entity136 and the @entity137 saw the man intentionally place his legs under the scooter , @entity134 said in a statement			0
" ( the man ) had repeatedly disregarded lawful orders to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk , and then feigned being run over before kicking over the police scooter			2
he was arrested for felony criminal mischief , obstructing governmental administration , disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , " the deputy police commissioner said			1
the demonstrations , meanwhile , seemed to pick up steam across the country by late friday afternoon			0
@entity1 affiliate @entity155 in @entity156 showed aerial images of protesters rallying in city streets			2
an oversize sign fixed to the outside of a building read , " outsource to @entity156			0
" hip - hop mogul @entity164 called the protests " inspirational			0
" " people want this country to be better , " he told @entity1			2
" they want the money out of @entity169			0
" he said he believes the @entity23 government remains largely controlled by corporations			0
@entity0 mayor @entity172 also addressed the concerns again earlier friday during his weekly radio show			1
he said @entity175 -- the real estate firm that owns @entity177 , considered a home base for @entity106 protesters -- made the decision not to try to clean up the park , as it had announced , after the company was " inundated " with threatening calls from elected city officials			2
the mayor said on @entity0 's @entity185 that he did n't know which officials allegedly made the threats , but the company decided to work out some form of a negotiated settlement in the coming days			1
@entity172 added that while he lacked firsthand knowledge of the conversations , he was told the officials generally threatened to " make life more difficult " for the real estate company			0
@entity175 issued a statement later friday saying " a number of local political leaders " requested the cleaning of the park be deferred for " a short period of time			0
" but the company declined to provide specifics on which city officials had made the calls or whether they were considered threatening			0
the clean - up cancellation , meanwhile , averted a broader showdown between authorities and demonstrators , who appeared heartened by news			2
" we are winning and @entity217 is afraid , " protester @entity213 said in a written statement distributed by the group			0
" this movement is gaining momentum and is too big to fail			0
" @entity172 's office also said the real estate firm withdrew its request for police assistance friday			2
" our position has been consistent throughout : the city 's role is to protect public health and safety , to enforce the law , and guarantee the rights of all @entity0 , " said deputy mayor @entity224			1
city officials in @entity0 had initially told the protesters , who have been mostly peaceful , that they would have to be ready to move out of the way of cleaners beginning at 7 a.m. but the demonstrators mopped , collected trash and scrubbed the pavement in the dead of the night as the friday deadline neared			1
when the word of the postponed cleaning filtered through the more than 1,000 protesters who filled the park , they appeared jubilant			2
" all day ! all week ! occupy @entity217 , " the group chanted , calling the development a victory of passive resistance			0
" we 're extremely excited			0
this is an example of what people power can do , " said @entity250 , a spokesman for the group			2
" this is what democracy is all about in this country , " protesters descended on @entity177 , near the @entity258 , on september 17 to protest the nation 's ailing economy			2
a number of unions , including the @entity263 and the @entity264 , have since pledged to support the @entity0 protest and similar demonstrations cropping up across the country			1
" you want to clean up something ? @entity272 up these crooks on @entity217 , " shouted city council member @entity270			0
@entity275 councilwoman @entity274 said the move to clean the park was a " ruse " to end the protest			0
but @entity172 said wednesday that the decision to clean the park was made after the owners voiced concerns about " unsanitary conditions and considerable wear and tear on the park			0
" " the mayor is a strong believer in the @entity292 and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest , " his office said in a written statement			2
but the situation in the park is " not in the best interests of the protesters , residents or the city , " it added			0
share your photos , video from the protests , but stay safe local business owners and residents have continued to express concerns about sanitation and the group 's affect on the local economy			0
the plan had been to clean the park in stages , with protesters being allowed to return to the park as areas were cleaned , but only if they obeyed the rules set forth by @entity175 , the company said			0
authorities had distributed a pamphlet at the park outlining the rules , which included a ban on camping or pitching tents ; lying on the ground or on benches ; placing tarps or sleeping bags on the ground ; and storing personal property that interferes with park use			0
the protest campaign began in july with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and a sit - in at the @entity258			0
