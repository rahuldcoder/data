-- a statement from @entity2 on friday marking the death of @entity4 included renewed warnings of terrorist attacks against @entity8 interests around the world and suggested that a process to choose his successor is under way			1
" @entity15 did n't build an organization to die when he dies , " the message said			0
it was posted on several jihadist forums known for carrying @entity2 statements			0
the man taking over will most likely be @entity21 , an @entity22 who was @entity2 's no. 2 under @entity4			1
the bylaws of @entity2 , recovered by the @entity8 military in @entity25 after september 11 , set out clear guidelines on the replacement of @entity4 , requiring the command , or @entity30 , @entity31 to " pledge allegiance to the deputy emir and elect him as emir in the event that the emir dies or is captured and there is no hope for his liberation			1
" it would be risky for @entity2 's on - the - run leadership to assemble a meeting of its @entity43			0
they may therefore choose to shortcut some of the required proceedings			0
@entity4 killing caps decade - long manhunt analysts expect that @entity2 may choose to announce the elevation of @entity21 through a written statement to avoid having him take the security risk of recording a statement			1
but they also expect that at some point , @entity2 's media arm , as - @entity53 , will release a video to mark @entity4 's death for maximum propaganda impact , one that could feature a " martyrdom " video recorded by @entity4 to encourage followers			1
the @entity53 videotape would probably include a message from @entity2 's new leader			0
it might take several weeks for @entity2 to put together such a video ; recent audio messages recorded by @entity21 on the democracy movement sweeping the @entity68 have been several weeks out of date			1
but according to @entity71 , which monitors jihadist propaganda , it would be feasible for @entity2 to compile and distribute such a video within a week			0
the clear guidelines for succession will , however , be little consolation to @entity2 's rank and file members			0
@entity4 was the charismatic icon of the terrorist organization and may have continued to play a greater operational role than thought			1
the seizure by @entity84 of multiple thumb drives , storage devices and hard drives full of data raise questions about whether @entity4 was continuing to receive information about @entity2 operations and whether he was in turn passing on instructions through couriers			1
the discovery of information in @entity4 's files on what appears to be a small - scale aspirational plot to derail @entity8 commuter trains on the 10th anniversary of september 11 indicates that @entity4 was being briefed even on the minutiae of some of @entity2 's operations			1
western intelligence officials had believed that @entity4 signed off on only @entity2 's most significant plots after 9/11 , including the 2006 plot to bomb seven trans - @entity108 airliners leaving @entity111 's @entity110 and the " @entity115 - style " plot to attack @entity114 cities last fall			1
while @entity4 's charisma inspired a generation of recruits , @entity21 is a self - styled intellectual whose long - winded video and audiotapes must be tedious to even the most committed of @entity2 members and whose arrogance has alienated many in @entity2 ranks over the years			1
@entity4 was the key unifying force within @entity2 , but @entity21 has always been a deeply polarizing figure within the organization , obsessing over minor theological differences with others and prioritizing jihad in @entity22 over other causes			1
like @entity2 's deceased leader , @entity21 possesses no formal religious training giving him authority to make fatwas ( religious judgments )			2
but unlike @entity4 , the @entity22 did not make up for this by earning jihadist fame on the front lines of the @entity25 jihad against the @entity139			1
during the 1990s , many within @entity2 resented @entity21 for persuading @entity4 to channel significant funds into his @entity22 @entity143 organization that otherwise would have been given to them			1
that was a symptom of the rivalry and tension that existed since @entity2 's founding between the group 's @entity22 faction and other nationalities within the organization , especially those from @entity154 , @entity155 and the @entity156			1
mixed emotions about @entity4 's death : how should we feel ? those who follow @entity2 say it was only @entity4 's charismatic aloofness , epitomized by his habit of listening to his top lieutenants bicker over strategy before deciding a course of action , that kept @entity2 's strong centrifugal forces in check over the years			2
the challenge that @entity21 now faces in keeping @entity2 from fracturing were demonstrated the last time @entity2 fighters feared their leader may have been killed			2
according to @entity174 , a former @entity175 jihadist and now a senior analyst at the @entity177 , a @entity179 counterterrorism think tank , about 150 @entity182 fighters , including a strong @entity2 contingent , fled to @entity184 in the mountains of eastern @entity25 around the time @entity4 's @entity187 refuge was being carpet - bombed by @entity8 b - 52s in december 2001			2
@entity174 , who was in touch at the time with @entity175 fighters in @entity184 , said that no sooner had the group reached the safety of the town than infighting broke out among @entity22 , @entity154 , @entity196 and @entity175 , and between @entity2 members and fighters from other groups , over who should assume command			1
the fact that under @entity2 's bylaws , members of the terrorist organization will now have to swear a personal " bayat , " or oath of allegiance , to @entity21 just like they did in the past to @entity4 may be too much to stomach for some of the group 's @entity154 and @entity155 members			1
@entity2 's internal constitution provides near - total authority to the organization 's emir , giving him alone the powers to appoint a deputy and members of the @entity43 , though in the last resort it states that the @entity43 can depose the emir if he " deviates from adhering to the @entity143 laws , or when he loses his competence			2
" it would be wrong , however , to underestimate @entity21			2
although the @entity22 may not be as charismatic or unifying a leader as @entity4 , he is one of the few @entity2 leaders with a reputation for strategic cunning and vision			1
during the @entity233 insurgency , for example , @entity21 tried in vain to persuade @entity235 to tone down his barbaric violence , realizing that it would create a backlash against @entity2 in @entity233			2
one of @entity21 's most important immediate decisions as leader would be whom to choose as the new deputy leader of @entity2			1
in terms of seniority , one of the strongest contenders for this position would be @entity247 , a former @entity22 army lieutenant and long - time member of @entity21 's @entity250 group			1
he is believed to have returned to the tribal areas of @entity252 last year after a period of house arrest in @entity255			0
according to a former jihadist , @entity247 is believed to currently occupy the " chief of staff " position within @entity2 , managing insurgent paramilitary operations in the @entity25 - @entity252 border region , with a special remit to manage the group 's relations with other @entity265 groups and affiliates			0
however , appointing a fellow @entity22 might only increase factionalism within @entity2			2
according to @entity174 , who met @entity269 in 2000 in @entity270 , a dispute flared up between @entity269 and @entity154 members of @entity2 while the organization was based in @entity273 - run @entity25 , forcing @entity4 to transfer @entity269 from leadership of @entity2 's military committee to its security committee			1
also , the loss of @entity2 's @entity154 leader may already have had a chilling effect on the group 's fundraising efforts in the @entity282			2
@entity21 may , therefore , appoint a non-egyptian to the deputy leadership position			1
one contender would be @entity286 , a @entity175 jihadist who made his name by escaping from @entity288 in 2005			0
in recent yeas , @entity286 has emerged as one of @entity2 's lead ideologues and propagandists , releasing a series of videos calling for new recruits			0
according to former jihadists , @entity286 's charismatic @entity182 - language speeches are particularly popular among a younger generation of militants across the @entity182 world			0
however , @entity174 -- the former @entity175 @entity265 commander whose group included @entity286 as a junior member -- does not believe that @entity286 yet has the stature or track record as a fighter needed for promotion to a top leadership position			0
a dark horse for the deputy leadership position may be @entity310 , a veteran @entity252 jihadist who recently became part of @entity2 's top leadership			0
@entity310 is currently the head @entity2 's 313 brigade , a group based in the tribal areas of @entity252			0
he has threatened attacks overseas similar to the @entity115 hotel attacks at the end of 2009 , in which more than 200 people were killed			0
that operation was carried out by the @entity252 militant group @entity322			0
the elevation of @entity324 would have the advantage of further strengthening ties between @entity2 and @entity252 jihadist groups such as the @entity252 @entity273 , @entity328 and @entity329			0
underlining the close ties between @entity252 jihadist groups and @entity2 , the @entity252 @entity273 have vowed to launch an attack in the @entity8 to avenge @entity4 's death			2
the @entity252 @entity273 have already been involved in one attempted attack in the @entity8			0
@entity335 , one of the group 's recruits , attempted to detonate a car bomb in @entity340 's @entity339 on may 1 , 2010 , exactly a year before @entity4 's death			2
what makes a promotion for @entity310 unlikely is that many of @entity2 's rank and file will balk at a @entity348 being one step away from the top leadership position			0
despite its many relocations and affiliations , @entity2 has remained an @entity182 - centric group			0
@entity8 military drone targets @entity354 in @entity155 @entity8 cleric @entity355 is unlikely to be promoted to a leadership position within @entity2 " @entity357 " as he is based in @entity155 rather than @entity252			2
though @entity355 has emerged as a powerful charismatic preacher for @entity4 's cause and an important figure within @entity361 , he possesses none of the combat track record that @entity2 members over the years have so prized in their leaders			1
moreover , @entity21 is very unlikely to reward somebody he has never met with a key leader or entertain the risk of being upstaged by the @entity8			0
in the end , @entity21 's accession may be short - lived			0
the " treasure trove " of documents , thumb drives and computer discs found in @entity4 's compound may provide @entity8 intelligence with crucial clues about his whereabouts			0
according to @entity380 officials , intelligence has suggested @entity4 and @entity21 continued to communicate in recent years and were possibly in relatively close geographic proximity .			1

@entity21 is the most likely successor to @entity4 , but he lacks his charisma
some @entity154 and @entity155 members may refuse to swear allegiance to an @entity22
but @entity21 has a reputation for strategic cunning and vision
he is likely to face a difficult choice in selecting a deputy
