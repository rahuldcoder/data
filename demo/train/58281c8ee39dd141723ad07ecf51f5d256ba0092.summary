-- there 's a bounty on the head of @entity4 , three of his children have fled the country , at least one is dead , and two of his sons seem to be having a public argument over whether to keep fighting or surrender to rebels			1
here is a look at the @entity4 family -- a large , at times quarrelsome clan that helped the embattled strongman hold onto power for more than four decades			1
@entity4 leader of @entity21 since 1969 , @entity4 was last reported seen june 12 , two weeks before the @entity22 issued a warrant for his arrest			1
an audio message purporting to be from him aired august 24 , days after rebels overran the capital @entity29			1
@entity4 's son @entity30 told @entity32 's @entity31 august 31 that his father was " fine			1
we are fighting , and we are drinking tea and drinking coffee and sitting with our families and fighting			1
" the @entity40 government announced earlier that week that @entity4 's wife , @entity43 , and three of his grown children -- daughter @entity41 and two of his sons , @entity48 and @entity49 -- had arrived in the neighboring @entity51 country			1
but on september 1 , @entity40 's foreign minister denied that the leader had come with them			1
" of course not , " @entity55 told @entity57 radio network @entity58 1 when asked whether @entity4 was in @entity40			1
" the hypothesis that mr. @entity4 could come knocking on our door was never considered			1
" @entity30 the most noted power player is @entity30			2
once seen as a possible successor to his father and an advocate of reform , he became a vocal defender of his father 's brutal regime			2
@entity30 is wanted by the @entity22 , which issued an arrest warrant for him in june on charges of crimes against humanity			1
although rebels claimed his capture when they rolled into @entity29 , @entity30 later showed up at the @entity77 in a convoy of armored land cruisers			2
since then , his whereabouts have been unknown , but at the end of august he vowed " @entity83 or martyrdom ! " in a call to @entity32 's @entity31			2
@entity30 , saying he was speaking from a suburb of @entity29 , urged @entity21 to rise up against the rebels : " wherever you see the enemy , attack them			2
they are weak , they have suffered lots of losses and they are now licking their wounds			2
" he is the second - oldest son , the oldest of @entity4 's second wife @entity43			1

i promise ! " @entity120 said in an e-mail to @entity110			2
he said the opposition can not " build a new country without having us in the table			1
" but he later said he would not surrender to the rebels			1

known in the @entity158 media as the " @entity159 " of the region , the striking blonde beauty was once considered her embattled father 's best asset			0
but , unlike her brothers , @entity163 has largely kept out of the public eye as rebels continue to quash the last pockets of resistance from her father 's 42 - year - old regime			1
many observers expected her to show more support for her father 's increasingly beleaguered regime , especially when a @entity177 airstrike in april killed her brother , @entity179 , and her own daughter -- one of several @entity4 grandchildren who died in the attack			1
in february , as @entity4 called on the military to crack down on anti-government protesters early in the @entity21 conflict , the @entity146 terminated his daughter 's stint as a goodwill ambassador in @entity21 for the @entity189			1

@entity48 has reportedly paid millions of dollars for private parties featuring big - name entertainers including @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234			0
several of the artists now say they have given the money back			0
it 's not just @entity48 's parties that make news			0
he has been implicated in a string of violent incidents in @entity58			0
he was accused of beating his staff , although the charges were later dropped			0
