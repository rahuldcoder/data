@entity1 , @entity0 -- speculation has been rife about the future of the @entity5 formula 1 team for some time			1
first there were the financial struggles at @entity8 , the luxury automobile manufacturer that gave the team its name			1
@entity8 took out a $ 4 million loan to keep afloat , using the " @entity5 " name as collateral			1
even if @entity8 sells its entire stake in the team , @entity15 rules state that the team must retain the @entity5 name then there was the surprise sacking of the @entity23 driver , @entity22 after he had failed to bring in promised sponsorship revenue			1
what was most surprising about this was that @entity22 was widely assumed to be the person who brought the @entity5 name -- and money -- to the team			1
his father in law , @entity30 , is a wealthy @entity23 financier and @entity22 was close to @entity32 , the team 's owner			0
last week @entity8 announced that it was to sell some or all of its stake in @entity35			2
immediately @entity36 responded with a press release intended to quash speculation that the team would not be able to finish the 2007 season			2
speaking exclusively to @entity2 , team principal @entity41 hinted that a rescue deal is in place : " actually it 's too early to talk about it			1
the only thing i can say is that we will be racing in @entity35 in the future			0
" one potential problem is that @entity15 rules mean that a team can not change its name mid-season			0
in september 2006 , when @entity5 bought the @entity55 team , it used the @entity5 name as a headline sponsor : " @entity55 "			1
this year it was allowed to change the team 's name to " @entity60 " but it may have to retain the @entity5 name			1
" that 's for sure , " continues @entity41 , " you even can not change name more than once in five years without agreement from the other teams			1
it 's speculation , the name might change , but it might not -- even with different ownership			0
" @entity55 had only raced for eleven grands prix before @entity5 's takeover			2
in 2005 it had raced under the " @entity72 " name after having bought the @entity72 team the previous year			0
so the team has already had three names in as many years			0
further complicating @entity5 's difficult year is its legal challenge against @entity77 and @entity78			2
@entity5 maintains that these teams are merely b - teams racing cars that are barely - disguised versions of the outgoing cars of their parent teams ( @entity83 and @entity85 , respectively )			1
@entity5 's contention is that , as an independent constructor , it has to pay for its own chassis development , its own wind - tunnel testing and so on			1
this situation is to deepen next year , when @entity15 regulations will allow new customer teams to join the grid			0
one of these is expected to be @entity95 , who many speculate will be driving @entity98 mp4 - 22s ( this year 's @entity100 car ) in the 2008 season			2
@entity41 believes these new teams -- along with @entity77 and @entity78 -- should be treated differently to the genuine constructors ' teams			1
" we have a clear line on this , " says @entity41 , " first of all arbitration will continue			2
we made a verbal agreement after the @entity111 @entity110			0
we do n't have it in written form yet			0
until we have agreement we believe customer cars can not be equally regarded as constructors ' cars			0
and that 's our position , and not only our position but the position of basically all the other teams			0
" looking to the future , @entity41 is bullish and points to the team 's past success as @entity72 : " the team is still the fifth most successful team in the current @entity35 era			1
it 's more successful than @entity129 or @entity85			0
we have shown -- as in @entity130 in the free practice -- if it 's raining we are competitive and the team works very well in moments where you have to make quick decisions			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity5 chief @entity41 *insists* the team able to complete the season
the team can operate independently of financial woes at @entity8
@entity5 *seeking* to find *settlement* to dispute over *unofficial* b - teams
