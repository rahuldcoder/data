while the professional game of golf gears up for 2015 in rude health , at grassroots level the sport finds itself in the rough			1
with more prize money on offer for the stars than ever before -- 97 players won over $ 1 million on the @entity10 last year -- and lucrative sponsorship deals , golf can rest safe in the knowledge that the future is bright for those competing at its top end			1
at the opposite end of the spectrum , however , the sport stands at a crossroads , with recent years having brought about a major slump in popularity in its traditional heartlands of the @entity24 and the @entity25 and @entity26			1
as golf continues to hemorrhage players , the steps it chooses to take next could prove crucial in turning its fortunes around			1
some 400,000 people reportedly left the sport in the past year in the @entity24 , although the @entity33 ( @entity33 ) states : " the numbers quoted do n't reconcile with @entity33 data and they 're not something that we reported or would report			1
" @entity33 results do show that the sport in the @entity24 has lost five million players in the last decade , with 20 % of the existing 25 million golfers poised to quit in the next few years			1
to compound that depressing statistic , the number of newcomers to the game in the @entity24 fell by 20 % last year , while according to @entity45 , the amount of 16 - 25 - year - olds playing the game regularly almost halved in @entity45 between 2009 - 10 and 2012 - 13			1
whether it is courses closing , merchandise sales falling or job losses on the rise , golf is being hit hard at grassroots level for its failure to attract new faces and keep hold of older ones			2
below par but why are numbers falling and is a re-brand of sorts needed to rectify the decline ? as with any pastime or hobby , time and money are two key factors , as the game 's greatest player , @entity66 , acknowledges			2
" i 'd like to play a game that can take place in three hours , i 'd quite like to play a game that i can get some reasonable gratification out of very quickly and something that is not going to cost me an arm and a leg , " @entity66 told @entity0			0
the 18 - time major champion 's words reflect the mood of the wider public , many of whom are still struggling from the effects of the economic downturn and live in a world that offers an ever - increasing number of cheaper and less time - consuming alternatives			0
to put it bluntly , the traditional concept of 18 - hole golf is struggling to find its place in modern day lives			1
meanwhile , as would - be golfers continue to turn elsewhere to get their fix , the younger generation -- the very future of the sport -- have more distractions than ever in a world where technology holds sway			2
" it 's @entity101 , cell phones , video games -- these are the activities that kids are involved in , " former player - turned - commentator @entity100 tells @entity0			0
" @entity106 and dad are working , and kids are playing video games			0
that does n't leave a whole load of time or people to populate these golf courses			2
" and its due to problems like these that , in 2014 , more courses closed than opened in the @entity24 for the eighth straight year			1
@entity119 in the sand ? for all its problems , though , golf can no longer be accused of complacency and being stuck in its ways -- it is , at least , sitting up and taking notice			2
@entity128 , ceo of golf equipment manufacturer , @entity127 is keen to tackle the problem head on			1
" as an industry we ca n't put our head into the sand , we have to evolve and continually modernize , " @entity128 told @entity0			1
" what we want to do is get golf clubs in people 's hands and get them hitting golf balls			2
" a variety of fresh ideas and innovative alternatives to the traditional game have also been formulated in recent years in an attempt to reinvigorate the sport			1
step out onto a golf course today and you could well see 15 - inch holes instead of their smaller ancestors -- you would not be dreaming were you to come across golfers kicking a football around rather than hitting a golf ball with a club			2
" a lot of people are getting involved and loving @entity159 , " president of the @entity155 , @entity156 , told @entity0 in april			0
" it catches such a large demographic because it 's such a low skill level to be able to play			0
you 've just got to be able to kick a ball			0
" for @entity159 , also read the likes of @entity164 and @entity165 , while @entity166 , an initiative aimed at crowdsourcing ideas to improve the game , is another example of how the sport is thinking outside the box			1
but perhaps more important than such alternatives which , let it be said , are starting to have some impact , golf is beginning to understand it needs to redefine the way it has traditionally approached getting people to play the game			2
many potential players can be put off before they have even picked up a club by the length of time it takes to make their way around a course			0
yet those that run golf are keen to get across the message that the 18 - hole game is only one side to a multifaceted sport			1
" what it means to play golf does n't just need to be measured on how many rounds you 've played , " @entity192 ceo @entity191 told @entity0			1
" did you have a golf lesson ? did you go to hit practice shots at a practice range ? did you play three holes with your wife , your spouse or your children ? these are all golf experiences			2
" playing 18 holes with three friends on a beautiful golf course is the ultimate , but you ca n't always do that			0
and we 'd rather see people just have a golf experience to get into the game			0
and once you get interested , the magic , the charm of the game , will keep you interested			0
" a ' smarter ' approach it is this type of change in attitude that was behind the @entity192 's decision to shift the focus for its @entity223 program to that of the enjoyment of recreation and playing with others , rather than an obsession with all - out competition			0
" @entity223 is getting smarter and they 're looking at the interests of kids and no longer assuming that golf can attract these kids with its traditional interests and traditional allurements , " @entity100 says			1
@entity223 's world no. 1 @entity236 is in agreement , having called for a faster version of the game that will appeal to kids earlier this month			0
given his global status , @entity236 is in the perfect position to have a positive influence on future generations of players -- something he is more than aware of having taken on an ambassador role with pga @entity223			0
" you 've seen how iconic players in the game have affected people and some people transcend the game of golf which is really what we need , " @entity127 's @entity128 says			1
" we had a good spell with @entity260 during the 1990s and 2000s and @entity236 is positioned to be another person who can do that			0
" with @entity236 taking his game to the next level in 2014 -- winning his third and fourth majors at the age of just 25 -- golf looks set to profit in 2015 as the @entity269 attempts to consolidate his spot as the sport 's primary superstar			1
such dominance can only be of good for the grassroots game , and those tasked with increasing its popularity are confident enough in the work being done that they are refusing to hit the panic button just yet			0
" we 're realistic -- there 's challenges , there 's troubles , like there have always been , " @entity191 says			0
" they 're different , but golf 's resilient and will get through this if we 're smart , and i think the industry is smart			0
" @entity128 also remains optimistic about golf 's fortunes in the coming years , pointing to the growth of the game globally			1
" there is still a very high participation around the world and it is growing in parts of the world , " @entity128 says			0
" so i think we should be quietly confident that golf is going to be in a good spot going forward			0
