" when he never showed , that was when people could tell there was something really wrong , " @entity83 said			0
" @entity125 was really important to him			0
he would n't just ditch out on the family			0
" @entity18 's family is deeply rooted in @entity57 , a city of about 21,000 residents along the edge of the @entity130 , and has strong ties to its police department			1
@entity18 's late father joined @entity57 police 's reserve arm in 1983			1

he was not involved in any undercover or large - scale operations : his duties involved administrative issues and training , @entity83 said			0
he was off - duty at the time and had no known adversaries or enemies , but his status as a police officer " does bring into question whether or not he could have been targeted , " the spokesman said			2
