carrots have long been credited with helping you see in the dark -- now one rider believes they can help win @entity6 gold			1
@entity8 @entity7 is one of the world 's leading show jumpers but has been labeled by his peers " the @entity12 " for his novel approach to training horses			1
last year he won the " @entity16 " event at the prestigious @entity17 feeding his horse @entity18 a carrot after every successful jump			1
and this year , he will return to the @entity23 event , which gets under way on december 16 , in a bid to defend his title with the same methods he 's honed in recent years			1
of his alternative approach , @entity7 admits the reaction was mixed : " when you want to change something and you 're too far from what they 're doing you make people scared			1
" and they were like ' this is silly , stupid , crazy			2
he does n't know what he 's doing			2
it does n't work '			2
i think 99 % of people were ' oh , oh , this is not good			0
' " so what exactly is the 46 - year - old 's approach to the animals he rides ? it is based on @entity50 , a program designed by @entity52 horseman @entity50 that used natural equine behaviors to communicate with and , hence , train horses			1
this , in itself , is based on ethology , the scientific and objective study of animal behavior			0
for @entity65 , the first sighting of this more novel approach to riding and training horses came from watching an unnamed @entity67 rider on a clip jumping a barrel without a bridle			1
the @entity8 himself has likened his own program to teaching humans a new language			1
and rather than treating the horse as a beast , he treats them as equals and gets them to take the lead			1
" if you make me cook spaghetti for you with a gun , " he says by way of an analogy , " you put a gun here and say ' if you do n't cook spaghetti for me , i will kill you			0
' " for sure you will have spaghetti but the quality is different than when i become your best friend and say ' i really want to cook spaghetti for you because this is my favorite dinner and we will enjoy spaghetti with a good bottle of red wine			0
' this is the difference			0
" he appreciates his attitude seems little short of insanity on the surface but his on - going results speak for themselves			1
@entity65 fully accepts he was ridiculed for a time but , as his success continues , he expects others to follow suit			1
" when they [ the horses ] choose to do the right thing , i will use a lot of positive enforce ( sic )			0
they were calling me the carrot man , it 's not because i have a sponsor that sells carrots but because the horses love it			1
" i think it 's time [ for this approach ] because it 's like with kids			0
you remember 40 or 50 years ago they gave you a cane on the hands when you did something wrong			0
" when i started with horses , people were just hard with them			0
' this is the animal , it must listen , i must be the leader , it must follow what i say , the big man that dominates the horse '			2
now it 's totally different			0
" @entity6 spirit he modestly downplays himself as a less capable horseman than many of his peers , instead crediting his results in the saddle to his approach in training			0
despite his humble attitude , is an @entity6 gold at @entity148 attainable ? " why not ? " he says			1
" there 's always one that wins			0
it 's not so difficult , you just need to beat all the others			0
i am a dreamer , always in my life , and i never quit dreaming			0
" on a personal level , this horse whisperer of sorts has recaptured his love for all things equine with his techniques when previously it had been on the wane			2
for him , it is simple horse play with or without the results in competition .			2
