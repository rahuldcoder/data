-- fearing that flocks of unmanned aircraft might soon traverse @entity5 skies , the @entity1 on friday quickly appealed a judge 's ruling that the agency does not have the authority to regulate commercial drones			1
the case involves @entity12 , a drone enthusiast fined $ 10,000 by the @entity1 for using his 56 - inch foam glider to take promotional videos of the @entity16			2
the @entity1 said @entity12 's flight ran afoul of its strict rules governing the commercial use of drones			1
on friday , less than 24 hours after losing its case , the @entity1 said it was appealing the decision by @entity23 , an administrative law judge with the @entity24			1
" the agency is concerned that this decision could impact ... the safety of people and property on the ground , " the @entity1 said in a statement			1
@entity32 said @entity1 regulations approved for manned aircraft did not apply to unmanned aircraft any more than they applied to paper airplanes or balsa wood planes			0
@entity12 's attorney , @entity38 , called it " a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators			1
" " as a general matter , the decision finds that the @entity1 's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of model aircraft is not enforceable			1
it would appear to me to have a very significant impact on other operators , " @entity38 said			0
but the decision confounded the @entity1 , which as recently as last week had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones			2
in a press release headlined " busting myths about the @entity1 and @entity56 , " it stressed that @entity56 enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes			1
" a commercial flight requires a certified aircraft , a licensed pilot and operating approval			0
to date , only one operation has met these criteria , using @entity69 's @entity68 , and authorization was limited to the @entity71 , " the @entity1 's @entity65 release said			0
" there are no shades of gray in @entity1 regulations , " the @entity1 continued			0
" anyone who wants to fly an aircraft - manned or unmanned - in @entity5 airspace needs some level of @entity1 approval			0
" the flight that got @entity12 in trouble occurred october 17 , 2011 , when he remotely piloted a $ 130 @entity84 aircraft at the campus medical center			1
the @entity1 investigated , and the following april it proposed a $ 10,000 civil penalty , saying that @entity12 operated the plane " in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another			2
" @entity12 operated the aircraft within about 50 feet of numerous individuals , about 20 feet of a crowded street , and within approximately 100 feet of an active heliport at @entity96 , the @entity1 alleged			2
one person had to take " evasive measures " to avoid being struck by the aircraft , the agency said			0
@entity12 appealed the case to the @entity24 , where the case went before @entity32			0
the @entity1 is appealing the matter to the full safety board .			0

@entity12 remotely piloted a model plane for commercial purposes
the @entity1 said he needed to get authorization beforehand
but *federal* administrative judge sides with pilot , dumps fine
@entity1 appealed , saying it fears the decision could impact safety
