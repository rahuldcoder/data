-- the fairy tale of a cancer survivor from @entity3 , @entity4 , who beat the odds to win the @entity7 a record seven times , has morphed into a parable about telling a lie			2
@entity12 has been revealing in his two - part exclusive interview with @entity14 thursday and friday night , but critics say he is leaving out important details			1
there has been a lot to learn from @entity12 and from those watching him as he starts to tell the truth			1
getting caught is just the beginning			2
this is the reason for his confession			2
after retiring from the @entity7 in 2005 , he made a comeback in 2009			2
" we would n't be sitting here if i did n't come back , " @entity12 told @entity14			1
cycling colleague @entity29 went public in 2010 with his own doping and leveled allegations at @entity12 as well			1
this eventually led to investigations against @entity12			1
alternative steps for redemption the @entity36 , which tests @entity38 athletes for performance enhancing drugs , praised his televised interview as a " small step in the right direction			1
" but it still would like a full confession of all of his doping activities , under oath at the @entity36			1
the agency had started an investigation against @entity12 , who sued to try to stop it			1
he told @entity14 he wishes he 'd cooperated freely back then , but now that he has a second invitation to do so , he is approaching it with a caveat			2
@entity12 said he would participate if the agency forms a broad " @entity56 , " involving doping across the sport of cycling			1
blaming yourself is not the same as telling it all			0
" i deserve this , " were his comments on his fall from grace to public disgrace			0
in the interview he disparaged his own character for hours , calling himself " deeply flawed , " " ruthless " and " arrogant			0
" " i was a bully , " he told @entity14 of how he treated others who might expose his doping and lies			2
' i want to compete again ' @entity12 admitted to personal guilt but was careful not to implicate others			1
things escalated to the level they did " because of my actions and because of my words , and because of my attitude and my defiance , " he said			0
but he also blamed the culture of cycling during the time he doped , saying the practice was widespread and just as much " part of the job " as water bottles and tire pumps			0
there were also allegations he still denies , like coercing teammates to dope as well			0
people will believe a lie			2
@entity12 cheated for years , and no one in the sport of cycling stopped him			1
he lied under oath about his use of performance enhancing drugs			2
" hundreds of millions , " as @entity12 has put it , believed him , adored him , and many wore yellow bracelets , because he inspired them			1
source : federal probe unlikely to reignite the fairy tale image was " one big lie that i repeated a lot of times , " @entity12 said			1
it became impossible to live up to and it fell apart			0
he publicly derided those trying to expose him , ruining some of their lives			0
" we sued so many people , " @entity12 told @entity14 -- people who were telling the truth and lost to him in court in spite of it			1
it was about controlling the narrative of his heroic story			0
" if i did n't like what somebody said ... i tried to control that and said that 's a lie ; they 're liars , " @entity12 said			1
" now the story is so bad and so toxic , and a lot of it is true , " he said			0
be nice to people on your way up			2
you may meet them on your way down			0
and now the tables have turned			0
why we cheat " this was a guy who used to be my friend , who decimated me , " said @entity138 , the wife of one of @entity12 's former teammates , who went public with doping allegations against @entity12			1
@entity149 , author @entity148 , journalist @entity150 , whom @entity12 attacked for writing about his doping for over a decade , former teammates and others he has discredited and sued have now gained plausibility			1
they are already critiquing his confession and casting doubt on its completeness			2
@entity149 and @entity148 have called @entity12 out over his denial of allegations that he coerced teammates to use performance enhancing drugs			1
it 's hard to regain trust			0
@entity12 's lies and bullying rattled his fans , former friends and teammates , even his own children			1
" i will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people , " @entity12 told @entity14			1
@entity172 journalist @entity171 believes the cyclist 's bullying was worse than his lies and left behind deeper scars			2
cancer survivors ' mixed feelings " he never showed any compassion during his years or any sense that it troubled him to destroy other people , " @entity171 said			1
@entity12 said he had been ruthless because he " expected to get whatever he wanted and to control every outcome			1
" " there will be people who hear this and never forgive me , " he said			2
" the emotional damage to his children seemed to touch him the most			0
appearing to hold back tears , @entity12 said he confessed to the three oldest children over the recent holiday break			1
" the older kids need to not be living with this issue in their lives , " the athlete said			0
" it is n't fair			0
" speaking specifically about his 13 - year - old son , whom he had heard defending him , @entity12 said he told the youth : " do n't defend me anymore			1
the former @entity7 icon said he did not think there was anything wrong with what he was doing at the time he did it -- something he today finds " scary			0
" that he did n't feel guilty was in retrospect " even scarier			0
" that he did not think it was cheating is the " scariest " part			0
" i viewed it as a level playing field , " he said , where most everybody doped			0
livestrong likely to survive @entity12 also does not believe he could have won cycling 's most prestigious race seven times in a row without performance enhancing drugs			1
and his success was not synonymous with contentment			0
" that was n't the happiest time of my life , " @entity12 said of his championship years			1
he told @entity14 he felt happier giving her his confession			1
but his doping and bullying years also were n't the worst in his life , he said			2
the time of his cancer diagnosis was worse			0
the bigger they are , the harder they fall			0
@entity12 would like to compete again but has no interest in returning to the @entity7			1
he 'd like to be able to run in the @entity237 when he 's 50 , but the punishment he 's been slapped with wo n't allow it			0
" i ca n't run the @entity240 , " he said			0
" anything that is sanctioned " by an official governing body is ruled out			2
" this may not be the most popular answer , but i think i deserve it ( being allowed to compete ) , maybe not right now , " @entity12 said			1
a six - month suspension is customary for doping he said , but he received a " death penalty			0
" now that he has been caught and has confessed , lawsuits he won could be reviewed , and his victims could come after him , tearing away at his fortune			0
but the nadir , @entity12 says , was his departure from his cancer awareness charity livestrong , which distributed the iconic plastic yellow bracelets			1
it happened in two phone calls			0
they first asked him to resign as chairman of the board			0
the second call was less to the point			0
" we need you to consider stepping down for yourself , " @entity12 said he was told			1
he got out of the way and hopes the charity , which was built on his debunked fairy tale legacy , can carry on without him			0
" it hurt like hell , " @entity12 said			1
" that was the lowest			0
" @entity12 's golden halo in the sport 's annals has decayed to a black mark			2
no other cyclist was awarded the victories he was disqualified from			2
in place of a record seven wins by @entity12 , the chronicles of the @entity7 bear seven record vacancies			2
cycling , facing an uphill climb , hopes next hero just around bend			0

the @entity36 still wants an official confession under oath
@entity12 destroyed people on the way up , who are waiting for him on the way down
the cyclist cheated for years , but nobody stopped him
@entity12 told his own son not to defend him
