the results of the @entity12 / @entity11 poll come a day after @entity6 officials said they had specific reasons to worry about security in @entity3			1
meanwhile , @entity3 state media reported wednesday that the suspected mastermind of twin bomb attacks in the city of @entity20 was killed in a police operation in the restive @entity23 republic of @entity24			1
the man died in a shootout at a house in the town of @entity31 , the official @entity26 news agency said			0

by contrast , a survey by @entity3 's independent @entity87 found that 53 % of @entity3 think their country did " the right thing " by bidding to hold the @entity38 , the state - run @entity84 news agency reported			1
but only about a third said @entity3 should seek to hold the @entity41 as well , compared with 43 % who disliked the idea , the survey indicated			2
respondents highlighted concerns about opportunities for graft and corruption			0
@entity76 torch reaches @entity4 concerns about security , human rights issues and the readiness of @entity4 accommodations have dogged media coverage leading up to the @entity8			1

the @entity76 torch arrived in @entity4 on wednesday , the culmination of a 123 - day relay that has seen it cover nearly 35,000 miles ( 56,000 kilometers ) , held aloft by some 14,000 people			1
along the way , it has been carried to the top of @entity118 's tallest mountain , @entity119 , and to the bottom of the world 's biggest freshwater lake , @entity123 in @entity124			0
back in november , the torch was also taken on its first spacewalk , after blasting off for the @entity127 from @entity3 's @entity128			2
two cosmonauts carried the torch -- unlit for safety reasons -- through the space station and outside in space			0
having reached @entity4 , it will be used to light the cauldron in the opening ceremony friday evening			0
then , @entity3 authorities hope , the focus should shift to the feats of sporting excellence performed by athletes from around the world			0
one @entity6 medal hopeful , two - time olympic gold medalist @entity143 , has announced he is withdrawing from the slopestyle competition , according to the official @entity38 website			1
the champion snowboarder said he wants to focus on winning a gold medal in the halfpipe competition			0

a " ring of steel " has been in place around the @entity166 resort city for almost a month			0
@entity3 security forces have also cracked down on suspected militants in @entity24 and elsewhere in recent weeks , after the december bombings in @entity20			1
but not everyone is convinced			0
speaking at a @entity175 hearing tuesday , @entity172 , director of the @entity173 , highlighted concern about the @entity8 and whether @entity178 fundamentalists in disputed regions of @entity3 -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets			0
" there are a number of specific threats of varying degrees of credibility that we 're tracking , " he said			0
" and we 're working very closely with the @entity3 and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those			0
" officials in @entity191 said tuesday that two female members of its @entity1 team had received a threat			0
greater danger outside @entity4 ? @entity196 said the primary threat came from the @entity198 , or @entity198 , which he described as probably the most prominent terror group in @entity3			1
" it 's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the runup to the @entity8 , " he said			0
" we think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the @entity8 themselves , in the area surrounding @entity4 or outside of @entity4 in the region			0
" @entity6 president @entity214 was briefed tuesday on @entity6 efforts to support security in @entity4			2
