-- the ongoing furor over @entity4 rep. @entity3 's remarks on rape and pregnancy was largely ignored on the campaign trail tuesday as candidates for president and vice president refocused their attention on the issues that have dominated the election for weeks : @entity14 and the economy			1
speaking at a community college in @entity18 , @entity19 , president @entity16 spoke about education , slamming his @entity22 rivals for not having a clear plan			1
" this country has always made a commitment to put a good education within the reach of all who were willing to work for it			2
that 's part of what made us an economic superpower , " he said			0
" we are going to make sure that @entity4 once again leads the world in educating our kids and training our workers			0
" " we 've come too far to turn back now , " the president added			0
@entity39 , the @entity22 vice presidential candidate , spoke at a @entity41 steel plant in front of a sign reading " we did build it , " another reference to a now - familiar @entity22 line against @entity16 , who in july said that small businesses owed part of their success to government - provided services			1
" we have this funny idea , @entity54 and i , that if you encourage success you get more of it , " @entity39 said at @entity51 in @entity52			1
" it 's a good thing			0
if you demonize success , if you resent success , you get less success and less prosperity , less jobs and less take home pay			2
" the attention on the economy came as @entity22 leaders were ramping up their calls for @entity3 , a @entity69 congressman , to drop out of his race for the @entity71 after asserting that " legitimate rape " rarely resulted in pregnancy			1
@entity74 , who spent tuesday fund - raising in @entity76 , characterized the remarks as " deeply offensive " and called on the @entity69 lawmaker to step down			1
@entity3 allowed a state deadline to pass tuesday , defiantly staying in the race to unseat @entity82 sen. @entity81			1
@entity3 defies calls to withdraw from @entity71 race @entity39 , who personally maintains an opposition to abortion in all cases except when the life of the mother is at risk , also distanced himself from @entity3 , echoing @entity74 's call for him to withdraw , and did not mention the @entity22 dust - up at his stop tuesday			1
the @entity95 congressman chose instead to wade back into a debate over @entity14 , which has been at the forefront of the campaign since he became @entity74 's running mate			1
@entity39 has proposed a plan in the @entity102 that would allow private insurers to compete with traditional @entity14 on an exchange , a move @entity82 say would amount to a " gutting " of the government - run health care program for senior citizens			1
@entity39 and @entity74 have hit back , pointing out that the @entity102 plan , as well as @entity74 's own plan , would not affect seniors currently enrolled in @entity14			1
they also claim @entity16 cut funding for @entity14 to pay for his sweeping health care law			1
@entity39 continued using the attack line tuesday , saying @entity16 " treated @entity14 like a piggybank to pay for @entity117 and his campaign called that an achievement			1
" vice president @entity122 , campaigning in @entity121 , pushed back hard on @entity39 's claim , saying the law put in place by @entity16 strengthened @entity14 without " cutting a penny			1
" " we extended the life of @entity14 by eight years , " @entity122 said			2
" the very thing @entity74 wants to eliminate now			2
saving millions of seniors hundreds of dollars a year on their prescription drugs , allowing them to go to preventative care			0
" @entity122 framed the upcoming election as a " make or break moment for the middle class , " and took a shot at @entity74 for not standing by some of his claims			2
" i do n't have to talk about the character or conviction of the president compared to his rival , " @entity122 said			0
" presidential elections come down to character , and the conviction of your character			0
the @entity4 public knowing that what you say , you mean			0
that you stand by what you said you would do			0
" he also took aim at @entity22 economic policies in general , arguing they offer nothing new			2
" there 's overwhelming evidence that their policies will not grow the economy			0
it did n't do it before and it wo n't now			0
folks , we 've seen this movie before			0
and we know , we know how it ends , " the vice president said			0
@entity74 , in remarks at a fund - raiser in @entity170 , took a jab at @entity16 's campaign one day after financial filings revealed the president 's re-election team had spent more money than it raised in july			1
" we 're a little wiser in our spending of dollars than the other side , apparently , " @entity74 said , according to pool reports			2
" i 'm not managing their campaign for them , but we 're going to spend our money wisely			0
we 're going to spend it to win			0
" money gap between @entity74 , @entity16 grows in @entity186 , where he appeared earlier , @entity16 sharply rebuffed his @entity22 rivals , saying their economic plans -- specifically @entity74 's suggestion that students struggling to pay for college borrow money from their parents -- unfairly benefited the wealthy			1
" that 's not an answer , " @entity16 said			2
" there is nothing a parent wants more than to give our kids opportunities we never had			0
and there are few things as painful as not being able to do that			0
" " i do not accept the notion that we should deny their children the opportunity of a higher education and a brighter future just because their families were hit hard by the recession , " the president continued			0
@entity74 's campaign fired back , saying the president 's own record on higher education was nothing to brag about			1
" under this president , too many young @entity4 are suffering from higher college costs , more debt , and a lack of good jobs when they graduate , " @entity219 , a @entity74 campaign spokeswoman , wrote in a statement			2
" today 's policies are just more of the same from a president who has n't fixed the economy or kept his promises to the young people who supported him four years ago			0
" @entity39 revisits @entity16 circa 2008 @entity232 , @entity16 campaign seek to tie @entity74 to @entity22 anti-abortion stance @entity122 to be in @entity234 during @entity235			1
