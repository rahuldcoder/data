@entity0 -- dear mr. president : how good of you , sir , to have personally telephoned two @entity0 heroes whose timely diligence prevented a lunatic from causing a catastrophe in @entity9			1
we @entity0 are happy to hear you called mr. @entity11 and mr. @entity12 to thank them for their vigilance			2
but there is a third vendor , mr. president , whom you forgot to call			1
his name is @entity20 , and he is an immigrant from @entity21 who said he was the first person to notice the smoking @entity23			1
" i thought i should call 911 , " @entity20 later told a reporter , " but my @entity25 is not very good and i had no credit left on my phone , so i walked over to @entity11 , who has the t - shirt stall next to mine , and told him			2
he said we should n't call 911			2
immediately he alerted a police officer nearby			2
" here in @entity0 , mr. president , we are not particular about which one of these great @entity0 saw that deadly car first , alerted the police and prevented a disaster			1
the @entity35 has a big heart , and the magnificent city of @entity0 has room for plenty of heroes			0
but we are also very fair people			0
so we would be grateful if you could kindly call mr. @entity20 and thank him for us			0
there is another reason besides fairness			0
mr. @entity20 is a @entity45 from @entity21 , and some of us @entity45 - @entity46 have a suspicion that your staff might not have brought him to your attention because the idea of a @entity45 hero in @entity0 does not quite dovetail with the stereotype			1
if there is an @entity46 of @entity45 descent who commits , or tries to commit , a criminal act , as @entity57 apparently did , we @entity45 feel we are all suddenly suspects			1
we feel we need to explain ourselves			0
yet if there is a hero among us whose love for our city does not fit the stereotype , he is ignored			1
this is not fair , and we believe you , as our president , can do much to alleviate this burden on us and our children			2
imagine millions of @entity45 children who go to school across @entity46 every day , just like your own children			1
imagine how proud they would feel if you were to call mr. @entity20			0
that pride of place , that we and our children deserve , would go a long way to alleviating the pain of the bigotry and racism that is aimed at us			0
we too would feel at home here and be even more diligent in safeguarding and protecting our cities from criminal atrocities			0
you recall , mr. president , during your presidential campaign you were , and still are , repeatedly " accused " of being a @entity45 -- as if being a @entity45 were a crime			1
we were hoping every time you denied being a muslim that you would add , " and if i were a @entity45 , there is nothing wrong with it			1
" finally , it was former secretary of state @entity93 who came out and said so when answering people who claimed you are @entity45 : " he 's a @entity98 ; has always been a @entity98			1
but the really right answer is , ' what if he is ? is there something wrong with being a @entity45 in this country ? ' " we were relieved and grateful			1
we , too , mr. president , are @entity46			1
we have our share of criminals amongst us , as do any other people			0
but we are not all terrorists , and we are tired of feeling false guilt or shame every time a criminal among us does something insane and stupid			0
we are ordinary people -- soldiers and scientists , scholars and students , homemakers and teachers , businessmen and lawyers , physicians and engineers , greengrocers and vendors			2
and you are our president too			2
we who claim mr. @entity20 as one of our own also have a dream			0
we dream that our children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the faith of their forefathers but by the content of their character			0
when the rev. @entity137 -- the visionary who said these immortal words i paraphrase -- uttered that phrase for the first time in 1963 , scarcely anyone could have imagined that you would be our president today			2
but now you are and can do your share to change perceptions			0
it is possible that a @entity45 might become president some day			1
for all we know , that president might be an @entity46 kid of @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity21 , or @entity153 parentage who is reporting to school this morning			1
imagine how proud she would be if you were to call mr. @entity20 today and thank him			0
his business is located on the corner of 45th and @entity156 , two tables down from @entity11 's			0
i can give you his phone number			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			1

@entity162 lauds president for calling two street vendors who reported @entity9 car
but , @entity162 says , a third vendor , a @entity45 immigrant , says he was first to spot @entity23
@entity45 - @entity46 hero *defies* the " terrorist " stereotype , he *writes*
@entity176 : @entity177 living with *prejudice* would be *buoyed* by @entity179 calling him
