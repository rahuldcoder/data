" when activated in a loss - of - control situation , a @entity19 , through one of its preventers known as the blind shear rams , is designed to cut through drill pipe that may be across the bop and seal the well to contain the hydrocarbons and keep them from flowing to the rig , " @entity13 said			0

we again call on @entity1 to make these payments within days , not weeks , not months ... so we can proceed with restoring our coast			2

" @entity56 said he was also calling on both @entity1 and the @entity76 to continue to clean up the shoreline , noting that " 40 % of the @entity53 coastline that had been oiled during this spill continue to be oiled today			1

@entity83 owned the @entity5 oil rig			0
