-- it 's the end of the world as we know it			2
and yet the world feels fine			0
friday was supposed to be the day life on @entity6 ceased to exist			1
the predicted apocalypse -- which spawned a disaster movie " 2012 , " a tv show tracking " @entity8 " taking extraordinary measures for the end - of - a - lifetime event and numerous jokes on social media and elsewhere -- stemmed from the end of an important phase of the ancient @entity18 calendar			1
founded around 2000 b.c. and still active , though its numbers and influence have waned significantly over the past several hundred years , the @entity18 civilization measures time in cycles called " baktuns " of 394 years each			2
the winter solstice that occurred friday marks the end of the 13th baktun			1
2040 looks good , too : asteroid is going to miss us " it will happen ! " a @entity0 commenter using the handle @entity32 predicted cheekily			0
" all credible @entity18 historians will agree , the @entity33 predicted the @entity35 would end the same year @entity36 went extinct ! @entity37 did they know ? ? ? ? " some took the possibility of the day of reckoning much more seriously			1
@entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43 , for instance , said he was teaching his family how to subsist on alternative sources of nourishment like algae , roasted mice and earthworms , as well as making a one - of - a - kind assault rifle -- a hybrid between an @entity53 and @entity54 -- to deal with signs of doom lurking around the corner			0
" i taught about economic collapse and how it actually looks on the ground , " @entity41 told @entity0 affiliate @entity59 , noting he was n't expecting the world 's total obliteration but rather a more gradual slide into chaos			0
" people want to act like it ca n't happen or does n't happen , and it happens around the world			0
there are places on fire right now			0
" but not even modern - day @entity33 bought into the coming apocalypse			1
they view the calendar as portending the end of one era and heralding the start of a new one , not the death of all the world 's species			1
" it 's an era			2
we are lucky to see how it ends , " said wood carver @entity83 in @entity85 , @entity86 , a sleepy village of fewer than 700 @entity33			2
@entity90 still makes for fun movies true to @entity83 's less - than - dire prediction , friday came and went in countless locales around the world -- from @entity95 to @entity96 , from @entity97 to @entity98 -- without any epic calamity			1
that 's not to say @entity101 is n't coming , and possibly soon			0
some who study the @entity18 calendar say the date for the end of the period is not friday , but sunday			1
and numerous groups , through the years and @entity108 , have prophesied the end of the world on specific days			2
they 've all been wrong -- so far			0
@entity0 's @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

pointing to the @entity18 calendar , some said life would end on the winter solstice
yet friday came and went for billions worldwide , without any epic calamity
some @entity33 say the day marks the end of one era and the start of a new one
