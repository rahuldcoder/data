-- @entity2 's preparations for hosting the @entity3 have been hit by a series of setbacks in the past year , and the national team 's results on the football pitch have been just as patchy			1
sunday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity10 at the newly reopened @entity11 -- a match that almost did n't take place due to a midweek bureaucratic mixup -- continued a poor start to @entity17 's second reign as coach			1
@entity17 , who masterminded @entity2 's record fifth @entity3 success in 2002 , has had four draws and a win since losing 2 - 1 to @entity10 in @entity21 in february			1
his side failed to defeat an @entity10 team which is struggling to qualify for the @entity3 , and may need to go through the playoffs as it is second in its group behind @entity26			2
it is not the sort of form the nation 's football - mad fans expect ahead of the @entity34 warm - up tournament later this month , where @entity2 will defend its title on home soil			1
the iconic @entity11 , which hosted the decisive game of the 1950 @entity3 when @entity2 agonizingly lost to @entity39 , has been extensively renovated since the last time @entity10 visited in 1984			1
the visitors then won 2 - 0 , the last overseas team to triumph at the @entity43 venue , and the son of one of those players was on target on sunday			1
@entity48 , whose father @entity49 won one of his eight @entity10 caps on that occasion almost 30 years ago , came on as a second - half substitute and fired his team 's leveler in the 67th minute			0
@entity10 looked set for another famous win when @entity58 striker @entity57 -- who also scored in february 's @entity60 match -- ran at the retreating defense and fired a shot that looped into the net after hitting the back of @entity65			0
however , @entity2 ensured that would not happen as @entity67 slotted in a sublime volley from @entity70 's right - wing cross with eight minutes to play			1
the home side had dominated the first half in front of 66,000 fans , but did not take the lead until 12 minutes after the break when @entity77 pounced following a lofted long - range shot from @entity79 that came back off the crossbar			0
@entity17 now has one more match , against @entity82 in @entity83 next sunday , before beginning the eight - nation @entity34 against @entity84 on june 15			2
the organizers have been rushing to get the stadiums ready in time			0
only four of the six stadiums were ready by april 's original deadline , while last week the roof at the venue in @entity92 collapsed due to " human error " following heavy rain			0
the @entity11 reconstruction has been plagued by delays , and last week a court ruled that the ground was not ready for the @entity10 match due to safety concerns , before the @entity43 government appealed the decision -- blaming a failure to deliver the required reports to the legislative body			2
meanwhile , @entity107 soccer came back to earth with a bump sunday as the national team lost 4 - 3 to the @entity111 in @entity112			1
@entity113 , second in the world rankings , trailed 4 - 1 before staging a late comeback			2
the @entity111 , coached by former @entity113 star @entity117 , took a 13th - minute lead through @entity120 's superb volley and then visiting goalkeeper @entity121 made a mess of a back pass from defender @entity124 and the ball dribbled across the line and into the net			2
@entity113 captain @entity128 thought he had equaled @entity130 's national record of 68 goals , but was ruled out for offside			0
second - half substitute @entity133 headed in @entity135 's corner to reduce the deficit but @entity138 forward @entity137 fired two goals to go second on the @entity111 all - time list with 35 overall , 14 behind @entity141			0
@entity135 smashed in his first international goal on 79 and @entity143 added another from close range , but @entity113 could not prevent a first loss to the @entity111 since 1999			0
it was the end of a long season for a @entity107 squad missing most of the key players who contested the @entity152 final for @entity153 and @entity154 , but it was an important preparation for the @entity111 -- who next take on @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 in three @entity3 qualifying matches			0
it was a joyful reunion for @entity117 , whose @entity113 counterpart @entity160 was his assistant when he coached his national team at the 2006 @entity3			0
in sunday 's other international friendlies , @entity164 drew 0 - 0 with @entity166 , the @entity163 beat @entity167 4 - 0 , @entity162 won 2 - 0 against @entity168 , @entity169 defeated @entity170 by the same score , and there was a stalemate between @entity174 and @entity175 .			1

@entity67 scores a late equalizer in @entity2 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity10 in @entity43
friendly match marks official reopening of @entity11 ahead of @entity3
@entity2 will next play @entity82 before hosting the @entity34 tournament
