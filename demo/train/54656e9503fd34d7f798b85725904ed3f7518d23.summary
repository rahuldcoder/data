@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 marked the first anniversary of the death of terror mastermind @entity6 with an unannounced visit to @entity1 , signing a long - awaited strategic partnership agreement meant to set the conditions of an @entity11 withdrawal from the war - torn nation			1
the president reiterated that @entity11 forces will not remain " a single day longer " than necessary , that he remains committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by september and that he will stick to a 2014 deadline to fully withdraw from @entity1			1
" we will not build permanent bases in this country , nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains , " the president said during a nationally televised speech to the @entity11 people from @entity23 early on wednesday ( tuesday evening in the @entity11 )			1
" that will be the job of the @entity1 people			2
" an undetermined number of @entity11 forces will remain in country past 2014 working as military advisers and counterterrorism forces , but officials have yet to decide for how long			2
the trip comes as @entity3 's election campaign gears up and just weeks ahead of a @entity40 summit in @entity41 , where the details of the transition and future commitments to the region are expected to be discussed			1
speaking to reporters from @entity47 after the trip to @entity1 , @entity50 chairman @entity49 , @entity51 , and member @entity52 , @entity53 , pointed to a series of lightening - rod issues expected to be addressed at the summit			1
they include hot topics such as @entity59 and @entity60 safe havens in @entity61 , @entity1 economic dependency on international spending and the grittier details of senior leadership positions within the nation 's armed forces			2
" one thing we 're going to see if there can be an early retirement of the officer corps to make room for the younger class ( of @entity76 from the country 's restive southern and eastern provinces ) , " said @entity49 , noting those groups are underrepresented			2
" that 's something that 's going to be discussed in @entity41 , a retirement incentive , " he said , a subtle nod to lingering questions over the army 's current legitimacy in traditional @entity59 strongholds			0
going back to the @entity88 era , @entity11 television networks have covered presidents speaking to military personnel or alongside foreign leaders overseas			2

" another attack by the insurgency that resulted in the deaths of innocent @entity1 civilians , with most of that being children from a nearby school			0
" the @entity152 in @entity1 said that the " indiscriminate and illegal attacks are unacceptable and that those responsible are fully accountable for the deaths and injuries of civilians			0
" in an e-mail , the @entity59 denied there were civilian casualties and said it planned the attack after word circulated that the @entity11 president was going to be in @entity1 , marking the start of their so - called spring offensive			1
@entity3 also spoke of a " negotiated peace " and said his administration has been in direct talks with the @entity59			0
in march , the @entity1 @entity59 suspended the development of a diplomatic office in @entity171 designed to allow them to hold talks with the @entity11 , following public anger over the killing of the 16 civilians			1
" we 've made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with @entity183 , renounce violence and abide by @entity1 laws , " @entity3 said wednesday			1
see reactions to @entity3 's surprise trip addressing @entity1 concerns that @entity11 will abandon the country once its troops leave , @entity3 noted , " with this agreement , i am confident that the @entity1 people will understand that the @entity11 will stand by them			1

we came here with a very clear mission to destroy @entity183			0
" @entity105 offered his thanks to the @entity11 people for helping @entity1 , and the presidents shook hands after signing the @entity201 in the atrium of the @entity203 , part of the @entity205 in @entity0			1
" this agreement will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season , " @entity105 added			2
" with the signing of this agreement , we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect , mutual commitments and mutual friendship			0
" the security risks in @entity1 seemed particularly pronounced given the secretive nature and timing of the trip			0
@entity3 landed in @entity1 in the cover of darkness , and the signing ceremony occurred in the early morning hours			1
presumptive @entity223 presidential nominee @entity222 said , " i am pleased that president @entity3 has returned to @entity1			1
" " our troops and the @entity11 people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war , " he said			1
" success in @entity1 is vital to our nation 's security			0

it seeks to create an enduring partnership that prevents the @entity59 from waiting out a @entity11 withdrawal to try to regain power , the senior administration officials have said			0
