@entity0 -- @entity2 call it a government cover - up similar to what forced @entity6 to resign			1
@entity7 call it a right - wing conspiracy theory			2
the fallout from the september 11 , 2012 , terrorist attack in @entity11 , @entity12 , that killed four @entity13 continues more than 19 months later , with further details last week that raised questions about how the @entity18 administration responded to the violence less than two months before the president 's re-election			1
few issues reveal the hyper - partisan politics of @entity0 more than the ongoing debate over an issue now known simply as @entity11			1
last friday , @entity27 chairman @entity26 announced that he had subpoenaed secretary of state @entity28 to testify at a may 21 hearing , alleging that the @entity30 failed to comply with an earlier subpoena for documents			0
house speaker @entity33 followed up by announcing a special congressional committee led by a @entity2 colleague would investigate the matter			1
the @entity27 voted on party lines thursday to create the panel , but democrats have yet to decide if they will take part in what they claim could be a @entity2 - led witch hunt			1
@entity2 - led @entity27 votes to establish select committee on @entity11 @entity45 : no reason for new @entity11 committee @entity26 called the administration 's lack of compliance " in violation of any reasonable transparency or historic precedent at least since @entity6			1
" at the @entity27 , spokesman @entity54 shot back that @entity2 continued trying to reap political benefit with what he called conspiracy theories about a @entity11 cover - up			1
" what we have seen since hours after the attack , beginning with a statement by the @entity2 nominee for president , is an attempt by @entity2 to politicize a tragedy , and that continues today , " @entity54 told reporters , adding that " what has n't changed has been the effort by @entity2 to ... claim a conspiracy when they have n't been able to find one			2
" here are some answers to questions about the latest twists in the story : what happened in @entity11 ? in september of 2012 , a demeaning video made in the @entity13 about the @entity79 got posted on @entity80 and sparked protests at @entity13 embassies in the @entity84 world			2
on september 11 , the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the @entity13 , an assault occurred at a @entity13 compound in @entity11 that killed ambassador @entity89 and three other @entity13			2
the @entity18 administration initially blamed the @entity11 attack on a protest against the video that escalated into a full - blown tactical assault			2
as details emerged in ensuing days , it became clear that an @entity98 - affiliated group took part in what was a coordinated terrorist attack instead of a spontaneous demonstration			1
then - secretary of state @entity45 created a special panel called an @entity103 to investigate what happened			0
the group led by former @entity107 chairman adm. @entity106 and retired @entity13 ambassador @entity108 criticized aspects of diplomatic security and made 29 recommendations , all of which were accepted by the @entity30			0
why all the controversy ? coming less than two months before the presidential election , the @entity11 attack quickly became a political flashpoint			1
president @entity18 had campaigned heavily on his decision to approve the mission that killed @entity120 and boasted of putting the @entity98 leader 's organization " on the run			0
" on september 16 , five days after the @entity11 attack , then @entity13 ambassador to the @entity126 @entity125 went on sunday talk shows and said the assault grew out of a protest against the controversial video			2
republicans immediately challenged the administration 's version of what happened , calling it an attempt by the @entity18 administration to hide a major security breakdown that signaled the broader failed policy in the region			0
@entity18 won re-election in november , but republicans have mounted congressional investigations into what happened in @entity11 and why @entity145 gave an incorrect explanation to the @entity13 people			0
what is the @entity11 email everyone is talking about ? last tuesday , the conservative group @entity150 made public @entity30 documents it received in response to a @entity154 request			2
one of the documents was a previously undisclosed email on september 14 , 2012 , from @entity157 , a national security official specializing in communications , that listed talking points for @entity145 about the protests that had erupted at @entity13 embassies and compounds in the @entity84 world			0
among the goals listed in the @entity157 email was to " underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video , and not a broader failure of policy			0
" @entity2 contend the email proves @entity27 manipulation of the messaging for political purposes in the immediate aftermath of @entity11 , despite the administration 's contention that @entity145 relied on talking points provided by the @entity178 for the sake of uniformity of messaging			1
" this is all about an effort to convince the @entity13 people that the president of the @entity13 had everything under control , " @entity2 sen. @entity182 said			0
@entity33 and other @entity2 questioned why the @entity157 email was n't included in documents that the @entity30 provided to @entity189 under the earlier subpoena			2
in announcing the new subpoena of @entity28 , @entity26 cited what he called " a disturbing disregard for the ( @entity30 ) @entity30 's legal obligations to @entity189			0
" @entity54 argued that the @entity157 email referred to the broader topic of protests throughout the @entity84 world , rather than the specific @entity11 attack			1
meanwhile , a @entity30 spokeswoman took issue with @entity26 's latest subpoena , telling reporters it was a political stunt			0
noting @entity28 was scheduled to be out of the country on the date of the hearing in the subpoena , @entity204 said @entity26 's committee " would have known if they reached out to us instead of issuing a subpoena			0
" is this new or just more of what we already knew ? the existence of the @entity157 email is new , and that provides @entity2 with a fresh front in their attacks on the administration over @entity11			1
labeling the situation a " defiance of the @entity27 's subpoena power , " @entity33 called it " the most flagrant example yet of the administration 's contempt for the @entity13 people 's right to know the truth about what happened when four @entity13 died in a fiery terrorist attack			1
" however , the messaging contained in the @entity157 email is the same as included in previously released documents , such as the @entity178 talking points that @entity145 relied on			0
@entity54 noted that the only reference in the @entity157 email to @entity11 -- denying that there was actionable intelligence ahead of time of an imminent assault -- was lifted from the @entity178 talking points			2
i thought the government promised to release all information ? the @entity18 administration previously pledged to release all pertinent information on @entity11 sought by @entity189			0
@entity54 noted that it turned over 25,000 pages of documents and that various officials testified at a series of hearings by various congressional committees investigating the matter			0
asked why the @entity157 email obtained by @entity150 had n't been turned over previously , @entity54 said it came under a @entity154 request that differed from the congressional subpoenas from @entity26 's committee			0
@entity258 's explanation was that the @entity157 email referred to the broader issue of protests rather than the specific @entity11 attack , which was the focus of the subpoenas			1
the talking points supplied by @entity157 were intended to prepare @entity145 for possible questions in her talk show appearances , he said , calling the document a normal duty of a communications officer in any government			0
republicans questioned that explanation , noting the @entity11 attack would clearly be the dominant topic that @entity145 would face and arguing the administration clearly knew that			2
what 's the upshot of all this ? for @entity2 , the issue resonates with their conservative base , especially the accusation that the administration failed to provide proper security for @entity13 diplomats and was unable to send military assets to respond to the @entity11 attack			1
at a hearing last week by @entity26 's committee , a retired @entity290 general on duty at @entity292 that night complained that the military should have tried to save the @entity11 victims even if the effort would have been futile			2
when @entity296 rep. @entity296 asked @entity297			0
gen. @entity298 " did we have their back that night , " @entity298 responded : " obviously not , sir			0
" @entity33 's announcement of a special panel to further investigate @entity11 fulfilled a request by many @entity2 colleagues eager to frame the final years of @entity18 's presidency on their terms			1
until now , @entity33 had resisted calls to establish such a committee , pointing to the four @entity27 panels already investigating the matter			2
@entity7 wanting to get past the issue portray republicans as driven by partisan desire to hurt @entity18			1
@entity54 has referred to what he described as @entity2 conspiracy theories regarding @entity11 that have failed to pan out			1
" everything that this committee would look at has already been looked at ad nauseam by multiple committees , " @entity204 said			0
" what 's the point ? " is there more than meets the eye ? in @entity0 , always			0
the issue gives @entity2 perhaps their lone line of attack against @entity45 , the overwhelming favorite for the @entity7 presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run			1
a new poll thursday showed @entity332 's strong standing			0
the @entity334 survey from @entity335 had @entity332 topping former two - term gov. @entity336 , the leading potential @entity2 contender in the nation 's most populous swing state			0
because @entity332 was secretary of state when the @entity11 attack occurred , @entity2 have sought to depict her as inattentive to security needs of diplomatic staff			1
at the @entity27 hearing last week , @entity298 described how he and others desperately considered possible deployment of a rapid - force team to @entity11 , but needed a @entity30 request that never came			1
" were they doing what they were trained to do or were they sitting around and waiting for the @entity30 and @entity45 to call them up and say do something ? " @entity2 rep. @entity350 of @entity351 asked him			1
however , the @entity2 chairman of the @entity356 , rep. @entity353 of @entity354 , issued a statement that said his panel investigated the matter and found " no evidence that @entity30 officials delayed the decision to deploy what few resources ( the military ) had available to respond			0
" @entity7 face what analysts expect will be a difficult mid-term election in november , with little chance of winning back the @entity27 from @entity2 and facing the possibility of losing their majority in the @entity372			1
@entity33 's call for yet another congressional committee to investigate could provide @entity7 with a rallying point to motivate voters to prevent @entity2 from retaking the @entity372 in november and gaining full control of @entity189			1
@entity1 's @entity378 and @entity379 contributed to this report .			0

@entity27 votes to form a select committee ; @entity7 *undecided* on taking part
19 months later , @entity0 remains riven by the @entity11 terrorist attack
a recently divulged email *reignites* fierce partisan debate from the 2012 election
