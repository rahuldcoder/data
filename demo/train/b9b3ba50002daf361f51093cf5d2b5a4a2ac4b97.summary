-- the drive for a tough federal gun control law has hit a political roadblock			2
but that 's not silencing @entity5 and @entity6			1
the loquacious vice president and the outspoken @entity9 mayor on thursday touted the " importance of passing common sense legislation to reduce gun violence , " including the need for a stiff background check system for all gun sales			1
they joined families of those killed last december in the shooting massacre in @entity20 , @entity21 , to push for new rules			2
they spoke at @entity23 as prospects for a ban on semi-automatic weapons styled after military assault weapons appeared to founder			0
@entity6 cited public opinion polls showing wide support for background checks , saying " there 's no real debate " among @entity34 about this issue			1
he said nationwide background checks on all gun sales would save lives , and that the only question " is if @entity40 has the courage to do the right thing			1
" a national requirement for background checks on all gun sales is needed because guns purchased in states with " weak gun laws " end up in states with stricter requirements , @entity6 said			1
" we remain optimistic that @entity40 will take action this spring , " he said			0
" there is no question that if this becomes law , it will keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them			0
it will reduce violent crime			0
we know that 's true , because in states that already require background checks on private sales , the rate of women murdered by an intimate partner armed with a gun is 38 % lower than in states that do n't have such background checks			1
" the ban proposal , categorically opposed by the @entity76 , would get fewer than 40 votes , senate majority leader @entity74 said tuesday , far below the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the @entity80			0
instead , the ban could be offered as an amendment to the gun legislation on the @entity80 floor in order to get a vote on it , @entity74 said			1
@entity5 , who lauded @entity6 's " immense " and " committed " gun control work , criticized those who say the proposals would violate rights			1
" tell me how it violates anyone 's constitutional rights to limit ( ammunition clips ) to 10 rounds , " @entity5 said			1
... think about how many children and teachers may be alive today had ( the shooter ) had to reload ( more often than ) he did			0
" he worked to raise the spirits of people discouraged by the power of the gun lobby			2
" i was told in 1992 , when i introduced many of these reforms , that there was no way , you never beat the gun lobby , it 's not possible			2
well , in 1994 , we did			0
in 1994 , reason prevailed , and we passed the assault weapons ban , a limitation on the size of magazines , and a number of other measures , including expanding the so - called @entity122 and background checks			1
" many reforms have since expired			0
but , he said , " one thing i want to lay to rest at the outset : they worked			0
they all had a positive impact on public safety			0
" @entity5 said that the @entity132 shooting in @entity20 was conducted with " a weapon of war , and that weapon of war has no place on @entity34 streets			1
" the shooter , @entity140 , gunned down 20 children and six adult staff members with a @entity144 rifle			0
" taking it off @entity34 streets has no impact on one 's constitutional right to own a weapon , " @entity5 said			1
he also noted that conservative @entity155 justice @entity154 " acknowledged that government has a right to limit certain weapons from being able to be possessed by @entity34 citizens			0
" he expressed his admiration for the @entity20 families and said their presence has helped move legislation through the @entity160 and gives such gun control reform a " fighting chance			1
" " it takes an enormous amount of courage to be here , " @entity5 said to the families			1
" and you say , well , what 's the courage ? having lost a child , i understand that every time you show up at something that ranges from a memorial service , or to talk about the circumstances in which your child was lost , it comes back to you in a flash , as if they got that phone call yesterday			0
and i told you before , i do n't know how you do it , but you do it			2
" ( @entity5 's first wife and the couple 's 1 - year - old daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972			1
) @entity5 argued against those who say assault weapons and high - capacity magazines ca n't be banned			1
he said gun - trafficking legislation will give police power " to be able to deal more rationally with straw sales , those sales where people go in , buy multiple guns , and then sell them to the bad guys			2
" he said the more police are on the streets , the better			0
the proposed reforms , @entity5 said , " will not solve every problem			2
it will not end every gun death			2
but it will substantially reduce it			0
" @entity0 's @entity207 contributed to this report			0
