-- never before in @entity3 's history has a parliamentary election resulted in a true democratic transition			1
despite militant threats and attacks that left at least 21 people dead on election day , @entity3 bravely voted in record numbers saturday			1
while we 're still waiting for official results , the @entity11 party looks to have a clear mandate to steer the country forward for the next five years			0
this is an important moment , but the challenges ahead are daunting			0
democracy and the institutions of civil society remain as fragile as ever , with minorities especially vulnerable to persecution			0
a range of militants groups still enjoys safe haven throughout the country			0
and the economy is in shambles			0
now is the time for @entity3 's new leaders to grasp the nettle			1
it is time for the major parties to shift from campaigning to governing , consolidate democratic gains and tackle deteriorating security and economic conditions			0
the stakes are enormous , and @entity3 's new leaders can not afford to miss this moment			1
a recent @entity41 poll found that roughly nine in 10 @entity3 believe the country is on the wrong track			2
this week 's elections provided a voice for millions to cast their ballot for a better future , a democratic future			0
the @entity49 should support this process and continue working toward a long - term relationship based on mutual goals			0
@entity3 today is buffeted by gale - force pressures : a long rivalry with @entity55 to its east , a bitter and bloody insurgency in its western tribal regions , a fragile transition in @entity60 and twin financial and energy crises that burn at its core , leaving millions without power and businesses without access to credit			1
in the coming weeks , @entity3 may face a balance of payments crisis unless its new leaders take decisive action			2
there is no doubt that we are dealing with complicated issues in a volatile region			0
the @entity49 has been working steadily with @entity3 to meet these challenges			2
with greater commitment and support from @entity3 's new leaders , we can build on existing areas of cooperation even as we press our interests			1
there is still a great deal of mistrust that permeates this relationship			0
it 's unacceptable that two years after the @entity49 found and killed @entity87 , the most noteworthy action taken to get the facts on how he came to be in @entity3 is the conviction of the doctor that helped us track him down			1
we know that militant groups have taken refuge along the @entity60 - @entity3 border			1
and let 's face it : when @entity49 hear about @entity49 troops in @entity60 under attack by insurgents who enjoy safe haven in @entity3 , they naturally see red			1
despite these challenges , the reality is the @entity49 and @entity3 share common interests and need to work closely together			2
now is not the time to cut and run but to renew our efforts to bring peace and stability to @entity60 and to address the terrorist threat that afflicts both our nations			0
@entity3 remains vital to any sustainable and peaceful outcome in the region			1
it can support genuine reconciliation efforts with the @entity60 @entity117 or undermine them			0
it can serve as the most cost - effective supply route for withdrawing our troops and equipment from @entity60 or block their passage			0
and it can rein in militant groups that threaten @entity55 and halt the spread of nuclear weapons and technology or aid in their proliferation			1
if ever there was an opportunity for @entity3 to advance regional peace and security , this is it			1
the international community is working toward a coordinated transition in @entity60 to mitigate the prospects of civil war as foreign troops depart			0
we need @entity3 's help to get this right			1
without close cooperation , our efforts will be imperiled , and @entity3 fears of international abandonment will become a self - fulfilling prophecy			2
the founder of @entity3 , @entity147 , once said : " the story of @entity3 , its struggle and its achievement , is the very story of great human ideals , struggling to survive in the face of great odds and difficulties			2
" @entity3 's story is still being written , but its next chapter will be defined by action , not by words alone			1
this week 's elections mark the beginning , not the end , of a long road			0
@entity3 's new leaders have an historic opportunity to provide real leadership and show that democracy can deliver			1
for their sake and ours , let 's hope they rise to the challenge			0
