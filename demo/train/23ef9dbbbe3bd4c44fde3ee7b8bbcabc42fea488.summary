editor 's note : @entity2 has a business partnership with @entity4 , which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to @entity2			2
you may think you have the worst boss in the @entity10 , but if you 've never had to dodge a cell phone , been fired over a breakfast pastry or had your work referred to as " a complete and utter mess , " you probably have it better than you realize			2
consider the following celebrities , whose poor underlings withstood verbal and sometimes physical abuse and lived to tell about it : @entity20 the high - profile film producer , whose film credits include " @entity23 , " " the @entity24 " and " @entity25 , " is infamous for his hot temper and verbal rants			1
the @entity28 once claimed he has fired 250 personal assistants , sometimes for offenses as minor as bringing him the wrong breakfast muffin			1
( @entity20 claimed the actual number is closer to 120 ; however , he was n't counting those who did n't survive his grueling two - week trial period			0
) despite @entity20 's reputation , however , being his personal assistant remains one of the most coveted jobs among wannabe movie moguls			1
@entity41 @entity41 is to her employees what fireworks are to the average person : if not handled carefully , she may cause bodily harm			1
in early 2007 , the @entity47 supermodel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for hitting her housekeeper with a cell phone over a pair of missing jeans			0
@entity41 insisted the incident was an accident , but a history of similar events -- including a 2000 guilty plea for assaulting a personal assistant on a movie set in 1998 -- indicates otherwise			1
@entity60 it 's no secret that the mastermind behind " @entity63 " has notoriously high standards , nor does he apologize for them			1
in fact , @entity60 , who is known for finding new and creative ways to insult everyone from contestants to " idol " host @entity69 , seems to relish his reputation as the judge everyone loves to hate			2
and why not ? after all , it is his famously prickly personality that has helped make him a household name			0
@entity78 @entity78 's name is synonymous with organized crime			1
he was as well - known for his involvement in illegal gambling , bootlegging and prostitution as for his brutality			0
his own men were behind 1929 's infamous " @entity87			0
" in 1931 , @entity88 finally went to prison for income tax evasion and was released -- ironically , for good behavior -- after serving eight years in federal prisons			0
afterward , @entity88 retired to his estate in @entity95 , where he died in 1947 of heart failure			0
@entity98 the recently - deceased @entity100 hotelier will go down in history as the " @entity98 , " a nickname she earned as a result of her erratic behavior and hasty firing of employees			2
after serving time for tax evasion in 1989 ( " only the little people pay taxes , " was her infamous defense ) , @entity98 again brushed with the law in 2004 when a court ordered her to pay a former landscaper for breach of contract ( @entity98 had abruptly fired the man after finding out he was gay )			2
@entity116 the hot - tempered ( pun intended ) host of " @entity118 " could give @entity60 a run for his money as the cruelest judge on tv			1
neither holds back when it comes to doling out criticism , but @entity116 steps it up a notch with slightly more colorful language			0
in fact , his fondness for four - letter words is matched only by @entity60 's fondness for tight black t - shirts			1
