@entity0 -- a @entity3 executive admitted to @entity4 that the bank did a " terrible job " of dealing with military home loans			1
the bank has admitted to overcharging approximately 4,500 members of the @entity10 military on their mortgages and said it accidentally foreclosed on 18 service members ' homes			1
active duty personnel are covered under the @entity15 ( @entity15 )			0
the law caps interest on debt incurred before service , such as mortgage or credit card debt , at 6 % while active , and also prevents foreclosure proceedings from beginning until nine months after the service member returns from active duty			2
" i would like to express to the men and women serving our country and to the members of this committee , @entity3 's deepest regret over the mistakes we 've made in applying these protections			1
i commit to you that we will get this right , " @entity36 , an executive vice president in @entity3 's @entity37 , told the @entity38 wednesday			1
but @entity43 's mea culpa was not enough for many on the committee			0
" you broke the law , your bank broke the law , should n't someone go to jail for that ? " rep. @entity51 , @entity52 , charged			2
" who 's responsible ? are you , as the executive vp who was given to us from the bank to answer for this stuff , should you go to jail ? " @entity36 said an internal review would be conducted and that @entity3 would advise the committee on the results of that probe			1
but @entity51 said someone must be held responsible			0
" you 'll take this seriously , if somebody went to jail with a white collar , " he said			0
@entity43 blamed much of @entity3 's mistakes on human error , citing the complexity of reading military orders that are needed to prove active duty service , and problems with not coding @entity15 cases to reflect their eligibility for the interest cap and foreclosure prevention benefits			1
" we were misreading orders and not calculating the period of eligibility correctly			0
as a result , we were not correctly ascertaining when and how the interest rate adjustment should be made , " @entity36 explained			2
rep. @entity83 , @entity84 , is a veteran of the @entity85			0
he suggested @entity36 's answer was ridiculous			0
" that is the weakest answer i have ever heard given in front of this committee , that we could n't read the military orders , coming from one of the largest financial institutions in the world , " he said			1
the congressman pulled up his @entity3 credit card agreement on his @entity97			1
he pointed out that @entity3 seemed to have no problem creating a 63 - page document " to calculate interest to the exact penny , " but then claimed to not be able to understand a military order			1
" are you going to stick to this that you could n't read this ? that is a standard military order ... that any 17 - year - old kid can read , " he said			2
@entity36 again acknowledged the bank 's failure , but pointed to new safeguards that had been put in place to make sure the mistakes were not repeated			2
they include a centralized unit set up to specialize in @entity15 loans , with employees trained in reading military orders , as well as a new hotline staffed by employees trained specifically on how to answer @entity15 borrower questions			1
@entity3 will return $ 2.4 million to the thousands of servicemember borrowers affected , adding 7.25 % interest to the refunds owed			1
out of the 18 homes wrongfully foreclosed upon , 12 have either been canceled or a settlement with the borrower was reached			0
the other six are still being worked on			0
@entity3 was n't the only target in the committee hearing			1
lawmakers also faulted the @entity132 for not staying on top of the banks with regards to the @entity15			0
" did ( defense ) secretary ( @entity138 ) @entity137 say , ' hey , we 've got to protect our people and make sure the banks serve them ? ' it did n't happen , " @entity51 said to col. @entity136 , who was representing the @entity132			0
" get the damn presidents of @entity3 and @entity145 into a room and say ' you have a responsibility here			1
' do n't send us the 150th ranking executive vice president , but you all take responsibility for this			2
bring them into the room			0
" the committee 's concerns that banks are not taking the civil relief act seriously enough were echoed in the testimony of one attorney representing service members in a class action lawsuit against @entity3			1
" i was a state prosecutor for 12 years in @entity164			0
every person we ever caught breaking the law , taking something that was n't theirs , was more than willing to give it back , give them mea culpa and be on their way , " said @entity165			0
@entity176 is representing @entity178 capt. @entity177 , the first servicemember to sue @entity3			1
the attorney charged that stiffer sanctions should be applied to those who break the law , including upgrading the crime of knowingly not complying with @entity15 from a misdemeanor to a felony , removing the one - year sentence cap associated with it , imposing civil fines , and providing for the recovery of attorney fees			0
@entity177 says he spent the last five years dealing with " harassing " phone calls from @entity3			2
he agrees that the criminal penalties should be increased and he 'd like to see @entity3 prosecuted			2
everybody wants to be strong , but when you call your wife at 2 a.m. to see how things are going and you spend 20 minutes discussing how you can send another letter ... instead of ' i love you , how are the babies , ' it 's rough ... it 's still in the back of your mind , " said @entity177			0
a recent @entity132 study showed that service members consider their finances to be the second largest source of stress in their lives , ahead of deployments , health , family and war			1
many on the committee worried about the toll this issue is taking			0
" anything that 's adding stress to a service member , especially in a combat zone , is incredibly risky behavior , so no stone should go unturned , " said @entity83 .			2
