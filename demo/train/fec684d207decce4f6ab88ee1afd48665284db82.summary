the @entity12 will send the @entity5 " some questions this week , as the beginning of our broader investigation , asking whether ... this was an exception , or is there anything in the records that show this is a pattern of misconduct that has gone on elsewhere by @entity5 agents on assignment , but off - duty ? " sen. @entity25 , the committee chairman , told " @entity27			1
" " why was n't it noticed if that was the case ? what 's the @entity5 going to do to make sure it never happens again ?

" @entity133 agreed , and added that she was told 11 % of agents in the @entity5 are women			1
