forget the cloud , and rework your mental image of those mysterious data centers			2
@entity5 has reinvented a tool for storing a mind - numbing amount of data : a cassette tape			1
but this is n't one of those rattling plastic tapes you used to compile your ultimate summer road - trip jams and , too often , were probably forced to rewind with a pencil			0
@entity5 's record - breaking magnetic tape technology allows it to store 180 terabytes of data on a single cartridge			1
that 's the same amount of storage as 1,184 @entity23 , @entity25 's roomiest music player , which can hold about 40,000 songs			1
using that number , @entity5 's new cassette could technically store about 47.3 million songs of its own			1
that 's enough jams for a really long road trip -- say , driving in @entity33 during a snowstorm			0
if you 're more of a movie buff , think of it this way			0
the cartridge , which stores @entity40 of data per inch of tape , has room for 3,700 blu - ray discs full of your favorites			1
the number obliterates the standing record , set in 2010 when @entity48 developed a tape that could hold 35 terabytes of data			1
@entity5 , which worked with @entity50 on the tape , presented the new technology over the weekend at @entity53 , a magnetics conference in @entity55 , @entity56			1
in very simple terms , the technology involves shrinking the microscopic magnetic particles on tape that store data			2
on average , the new particles are 7.7 nanometers wide			0
there are 10 million nanometers in one centimeter			0
in a news release , @entity5 said it would like to pursue a commercial use for the new cassette tape technology , as well as continuing to improve it			1
but if you 're dreaming of someday popping that tape into some sort of digital - age boombox and pushing " play , " you may be in for a bit of a disappointment			0
tape has the potential for massive data storage , but it 's unwieldy to actually use			2
recording to , and retrieving data from , tape takes a lot longer than digital storage devices and players we 've become accustomed to in an era of web streaming			2
so , it 's a lot more likely that tape will be used to back up huge databases than to save , and play , our music collections			0
we liked the idea of needing only one cassette for a cross-country drive .			0

@entity5 has made a cassette tape that can store more than 1,100 @entity23 *classics*
a single cartridge can hold *185* terabytes of data
it may be sold , but likely not for *personal* media
