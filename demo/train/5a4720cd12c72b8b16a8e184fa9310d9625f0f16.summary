-- " @entity4 " rolls off the tongue pretty easily , and the @entity3 capital itself feels as if it 's been around for a long time			1
but @entity4 is a relatively recent construct -- the result of an 1873 merger between two distinct cities : @entity9 on the western bank of the @entity11 and @entity12 on the bank opposite			1
the result , @entity4 , sounds so much more natural than other twin cities -- @entity18 / @entity17 or @entity20 / @entity19 -- it 's difficult to imagine that the alternative " @entity22 " was floated seriously at the time			1
although they 've been populated for centuries , @entity12 and @entity9 have developed so separately that the first bridge spanning the @entity11 , the imposing @entity26 , was n't built until 1849			1
their distinctiveness continues to this day			0
view from the hills built on a series of hills , @entity9 is the site of a grand @entity35 palace and has a detached , imperial air of settled wealth			2
in contrast , populous @entity12 -- as flat as a prairie -- is busy , buzzing and bourgeois , with an assortment of bars , cafés and gourmet restaurants			1
most visitors are content with the view across to @entity12 from the @entity49 on @entity50 and ignore the less accessible @entity51 just to the south			2
more : 11 things to know before visiting @entity3 yet here the ramparts of the old @entity56 fortress ( @entity56 sétány 1 ; +36 1 279 - 1963 ; free entry ) provide equally stunning vistas over the @entity11			2
it 's in the hiking network of the @entity61 , where city residents come to picnic and ramble through the woods			2
during weekdays , you can walk for hours without seeing another human being			0
kids ' railway @entity69 hide the @entity70 ( @entity72 - hegyi @entity71 ; +36 1 397 5394 ; $ 5.40 adult , $ 2.70 child ; closed monday ) a narrow - gauge line operated entirely by 10 - to - 14 year olds as ticket sellers , announcers and conductors -- only the drivers are adults			0
the line runs for 45 minutes through 11 kilometers of forest landscape with seven stops in - between			0
when night falls , @entity9 goes to sleep and @entity12 wakes up			1
whether you prefer the opulence of the @entity88 , one of @entity93 's finest , or the conviviality of the city 's legendary ruin pubs , you want to be on the pest side of the river after dark			1
pest has been a hotbed of @entity3 national pride to counter the @entity101 @entity35 court reigning from @entity50			0
@entity9 may have the palace , but @entity12 houses the @entity3 parliament ( 1 - 3 @entity104 ; +36 1 441 4000 ; daily tours in @entity107 april - october , $ 7.80 @entity109 citizens , $ 3.90 others ) , a dazzling neo-gothic building whose superlative interior is more than a match for its exterior			1
spa wars pest is as practical and business - oriented as @entity9 is aloof and superior			1
@entity9 has thermal spas , such as the @entity118 or @entity119 , built by the old ruling elites			1
@entity12 has an open - air people 's pool : the neo-baroque @entity124 complex where you can still find old men playing chess , half immersed in the water			2
( see @entity131 for complete spa information			0
) @entity12 's bustle is best reflected in its most well - known shopping artery : @entity135			2
it suffered during the @entity138 era but the street has regained its ritzy reputation			0
more : 8 must - see @entity4 buildings fittingly , @entity9 has the @entity144 's @entity143 cemetery , where famous @entity3 such as classical composer @entity145 and conductor @entity146 are buried in extravagant tombs			1
@entity12 , on the other hand , has the vitality and life force associated with the fiery @entity3 temperament -- nowhere more evident than in the former city 's culinary culture			1
café cultured in @entity156 you can find one of @entity93 's monuments to confectionary brilliance : the café founded by @entity161 ( @entity162 , 7 - 8 @entity156 , +36 1 429 9000 ) in 1885 , complete with over-elaborate ceilings and chandeliers			0
not far away , the renovated art nouveau decor of the @entity166 ( @entity167 u. 1 ; +36 1 501 4000 ) gives traditional @entity3 dishes a modern makeover			0
further out , at the edges of the seventh district , the fin - de - siècle elegance of @entity171 ( part of the @entity4 ; 9 - 11 @entity173 , +36 1 886 6167 ) has to be seen to be believed			2
some tourists do just that -- constantly snapping diners from the gallery above			0
" visit @entity45 but stay in @entity12 " is the advice every @entity4 visitor is given			1
but in fact the once - separate cities have such distinct characters you should spend as much time exploring each			0
it 's the only way to do them justice			0
@entity0 's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile			0
however , @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

separated by the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity9 became one city in 1873
@entity4 was almost called " @entity22 "
@entity9 has great views ; pest is flat but buzzing
even the thermal spas on each side have a different vibe
