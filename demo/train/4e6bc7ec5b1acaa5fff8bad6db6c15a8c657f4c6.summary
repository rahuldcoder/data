-- the first line in most of the early obituaries of @entity3 described him primarily as lead singer for the @entity6			1
this is somewhat like starting an obituary for @entity9 by saying he was president of he @entity11 during the @entity12			0
or , more to the point , that @entity14 played piano or that @entity16 was a folk singer			0
in each case , it 's a start			2
at the same time , it does n't begin telling you what 's important to know			0
in fact , what i 've been hearing and reading online from friends and others , since word came sunday of @entity3 's death at age 71 , were reactions that vibrated with emotional intensity and startling intimacy			1
" he changed my life " was a recurring theme , as was " i would n't have been a _ _ _ _ _ _ without him			1
" and you could fill in the blank with any or all of the following : poet , artist , musician , singer , writer , performer , iconoclast , @entity49 -- all of which @entity3 was			2
and the example he set in those roles empowered generations as decisively and enduringly as such disparate peers as @entity16 , @entity55 , @entity56 and others who made the ' 60s ( and a lot that came afterward ) possible			0
" he was as gifted , as important and influential , as any artist of the last fifty years , " wrote @entity60 , a writer and rock journalist whose own work , including the 2001 memoir " @entity63 , " has evoked some of the same darkness , mordancy and pungent wit that filtered through @entity3 's songs			1
" and he was a great favorite of mine since the day i first heard the @entity6 's debut as i was sitting on the floor of the @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76 in the summer of 1967			0
" " even though i knew ( @entity3 ) was sick , i thought he 'd last forever " was another recurring theme that one read in blogs and social media postings			1
this seemed aligned with the perception of @entity3 as a hard - bitten survivor of drug abuse and other wretched excesses who continued to put out trenchant albums , alienate journalists , and inspire independent rockers and others who sought the cutting edge he helped define			2
@entity95 's @entity94 blog -- which celebrated @entity3 as " the last of the old @entity49 characters , a true curmudgeon " -- alluded to the knowingly affectionate jibes many people made over @entity3 's liver transplant this past spring			1
" look what he did to the last one , people said , " wrote @entity95			0
" and it 's true that @entity3 put his body through hell back in the day			1
he eventually cleaned up his habits but he never softened up			0
" the @entity109 postings of @entity3 's performances also blanketed the social media landscape			1
" @entity112 " and " @entity113 , " arguably his two most widely successful and recognized singles , were the most frequently shared			0
some reached back to the 1967 album that started it all , " @entity118 , " by posting such songs as " @entity120 , " " @entity121 " and " @entity122 " -- songs that took their listeners to dark , forbidding places many of them were n't ready to go , whether it was the dark corridors of a @entity130 brownstone to buy hard drugs or even harder - core rituals of sadomasochistic sex			0
over time , the album would become the hallowed cornerstone of such iconoclastic offshoots of the rock - pop universe as new wave , punk and indie rock			0
it also created a space where a new kind of romantic vision of outlaw street life would seize the imaginations not only of musicians , but of artists , writers and filmmakers			1
there were even those who insisted on posting , in its entirety , @entity3 's 1975 experimental lp , " @entity153 , " consisting almost entirely of guitar feedback running at different speeds			1
it sounds just as confounding and fascinating now as it did to listeners in the mid- ' 70s			0
but as with all of @entity3 's music , scary and wistful , funny and sad , tender and spiteful , these strange sounds , whatever their reason for existing , will remain a thrown gauntlet to anyone who 's alienated themselves from the status quo to make something of their own that confuses or arouses people to think differently about their surroundings			1
as @entity60 wrote , " there always seemed something indomitable about ( @entity3 ) and his commitment			2
today , especially , he still seems indomitable			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

reactions to @entity3 's death showed emotional intensity and intimacy , writes @entity178
he says many commented that @entity3 had changed their lives
@entity188 : @entity3 was a *pioneer* in his romantic vision of outlaw street life
many knew @entity3 was ill , but thought he 'd last forever , he writes
