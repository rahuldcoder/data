@entity1 the secretary of veterans affairs announced monday a massive restructuring of the department in the wake of a scandal that left more than a hundred thousand veterans waiting for health care			1
@entity10 secretary @entity9 , who took over the agency three months ago after his predecessor @entity12 resigned , said at least 35 people will be initially fired -- and more than 1,000 could soon follow			1
" we 're simplistically talking about people who violated our values , " @entity9 said in an interview with @entity16 ' " @entity15 " that aired sunday			1
" it 's integrity , it 's advocacy , it 's respect , it 's excellence			0
these are the things that we try to do for our veterans			0
" but @entity9 first needs to build up a case against each person listed on the pink slip list , since a judge needs to approve each firing			0
" we 've got to make it stick , " he said in the interview			0
beyond sacking officials that do n't meet the @entity10 's new standards , @entity9 's reforms are also expected to restructure health care services for veterans , consolidating management of the massive health care system and giving veterans a single point of contact to get care , the @entity30 reported saturday			1
@entity9 's reforms will also attack the core cause of the @entity10 's sometimes 90 - day - plus wait times that left some veterans dying as they waited for a doctor 's appointments			1
details of the delays were first reported by @entity2 in november			2
@entity9 told " @entity15 " he hopes to hire about 28,000 medical professionals to join the agency 's hospitals and clinics around the country , including about 2,500 mental health professionals			2
and the new @entity10 secretary is taking the initiative to reach that goal , visiting hospitals and medical schools to recruit young doctors to join the ranks of a health care network on the rise -- and pitching incentives like student loan forgiveness			0
