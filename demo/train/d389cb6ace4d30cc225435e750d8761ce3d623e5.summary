-- @entity2 's decision to reject pop star @entity4 's adoption of a local child has reignited global debate about the ethics of international adoption			1
author @entity9 poses with her family , which includes biological and adopted children			1
some international aid groups have praised the decision as best for the child , a 4 - year - old girl named @entity17			1
" i think it really highlights the bigger picture that there are so many children living in poverty in @entity2 , and while @entity4 has good intentions ... children would be better off staying in their own communities whenever possible , " said @entity18 , policy director for @entity19 , a development group that also works in @entity2			1
" we really need to stay focused on the needs of @entity2 and of all the children there , " she added			1
to get another perspective on the situation , @entity0 also talked with @entity9 , an author and mother of five adopted children			1
@entity35 , who lives in @entity36 , @entity37 , is the mother of four biological children , four children adopted from @entity41 and one adopted child from @entity43			1
the following is an edited transcript of that conversation : @entity0 : what 's your initial reaction to the news that @entity4 's adoption of a @entity2 child has been rejected ? @entity35 : surprise			1
... it was awfully tricky with @entity4 's first adoption , when the child turned out to have devoted family members nearby			1
[ the singer 's adoption of a @entity2 boy was finalized last year			1
] and if that 's true with this child also , it seems a similar sticky situation			2
that 's not the situation for the majority of orphanage children around the world , who do n't have caring grandparents or aunts and uncles a short walk or bike ride away			1
i think it gives people an odd perspective on what international adoption can mean for children who do n't have any support network outside the walls of an orphanage			1
you often hear attacks on international adoption as robbing a child of his or her culture , and that 's both true and false			1
it 's true that an internationally adopted child loses the rich background of history and religion and culture and language that the child was born into , but the cruel fact is that most children do n't have access to the local , beautiful culture within an orphanage			1
... there 's a culture in orphanages that children are eager to escape from , and it 's a culture of being reared as a group and not being doted upon by parents			1
for any child , that 's the bottom line			2
the fact is that a human child wants that mommy or daddy or both			0
we 're just wired to want that and to need that			0
and there 's no way an institutional setting can give a human baby what the child needs			2
so you have to balance priorities			0
... i think what some of the human rights group say is absolutely accurate : that international adoption does not begin to solve the problems of the world 's orphaned children			1
it 's truly not the answer			2
... at the same time , international adoption , even though it does n't solve the whole problem , it solves a problem for a few			1
i think it can be a brilliant solution to the problem of adults wanting a child in their lives or wanting more children in their lives and the problem of children who want parents in their lives			1
@entity0 : how is it different for a celebrity person seeking an [ international ] adoption than for yourself ? @entity35 : we do n't jet in , take a child and fly out with a child			1
for an average citizen trying to adopt , it takes most of a year			1
first of all , you work with a country that already has international adoption regulations in place , so you have a bureaucracy dealing with international adoption			1
a big part of that is determining that the child is a true orphan , that there is no one who can care for the child			0
and in the case of our older kids ' adoptions , people had to come to court to testify that there was no one to take the children			1
so you do n't run the risk of ' oh , whoops , there 's a grandmother down the street			2
' ... @entity0 : there 's been some chatter today online questioning why a person would n't adopt an orphaned child from their own country			2
@entity35 : within the adoption world , it 's a non-issue			2
there are children all over the world who need families , and some find their children in @entity205 , and some find their children in @entity43 , you know ? ... it 's just outsiders who look on and judge disapprovingly , but then they do n't go on to adopt the neighborhood children , right ? ... there are many children who need help , and anyone who wants to reach out and adopt a child from foster care or from a @entity218 orphanage should reach out and do it			1
@entity0 : what has the experience been like for your own foster children ? @entity35 : we 're a white @entity226 family in @entity36 , but @entity36 is a major city for eastern @entity228 immigrants			2
so our children are in touch with the @entity41 diaspora , and they feel very much a part of that			2
@entity234 is full of @entity41 restaurants , markets , festivals			0
for a while , my kids were playing on weekends with an @entity41 soccer league			0
i have an @entity41 baby sitter who speaks to them only in @entity246 so they wo n't lose their language , and we always have @entity41 food here			0
two years ago , we went back to @entity41 with the kids and had a big reunion for one of my sons and his extended family ... we just consider ourselves sort of part of this amazing bicontinental family			0
@entity0 : the first time you adopted internationally , can you tell me what your ethical considerations were and how you worked through that personally ? @entity35 : our first adoption was of a boy in rural @entity43			2
the kids were hungry , thirsty , no education			0
i first met our son , @entity265 , when he was 4			0
he was 4 years old , and he did not know what his own name was ... when he first came , he was just so anxious about food			0
when he would wake up , he was just shaking , wondering if there was going to be enough food			0
so i started waking him up with food			0
he had issues with water			0
he was n't sure if there was going to be enough water to drink , so i bought him a little canteen so he could wear his water all of the time			0
do i have ethical issues about taking him out of that orphanage ? i do n't			0
@entity0 : is there anything else you wanted to add ? @entity35 : i admire @entity4			2
and i do n't understand why everyone attacks @entity4			2
i think that she is in part trying to raise the world 's consciousness about the @entity228 orphan crisis			0
you know , 95 percent of the children orphaned by @entity290 [ globally ] are in @entity292			0
you do n't hear world leaders talking about it			0
where is the global outrage ? ... so , into the breach steps a celebrity			0
but do n't attack her for it , you know			0
maybe her methods are not what ours would be , but how many of us are @entity4 ? but at least she is out there ; she 's creating a school			1
obviously , she 's fallen in love with the @entity2 children to such an extent she wants to make some of them her own			1
and i think that it 's great			0
i just do n't understand why the world 's attacking her			0
let other people step forth and do something			0
at least she 's trying			0
that 's my feeling .			0
