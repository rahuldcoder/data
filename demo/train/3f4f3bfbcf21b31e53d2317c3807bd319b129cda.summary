my @entity2 has been great to me			1
sure , we had some dropped calls , but who has n't ? but something is wrong with our relationship			2
and i know it 's not my @entity2 , it 's @entity12			1
yes , i know this is n't the best time to bring this up , what with @entity17 's earnings report showing that so many others are also falling out of love with their iphones			1
but i could not keep it inside any longer			2
i realized our problems had gotten bad when reading media reports about the new @entity2 expected to be released this fall			1
in the past , those articles truly excited me			2
i could n't wait for the new iphone			2
i would scour the net looking for more hints			2
in those days , i was crazy about the @entity2			1
but when i read about the @entity2 , my reaction was not one of excitement , but pity			1
the @entity2 is doing all it can to stay attractive			1
it 's like the phone version of @entity40			1
maybe the @entity2 caught me looking at the younger @entity41			1
i tried not to look			2
but how can i be blamed for taking a glance ? so , i googled an image			0
and yes , i asked a friend if i could try his			0
but i have n't done anything wrongâ € ” at least that 's what i keep telling myself			1
@entity47 : @entity17 badly misses forecasts i longingly think back to how my relationship started with the @entity2			1
it was the summer , 2007			0
i thought it would be a typical summer			0
i 'd use my phone to make some calls , text friends from it			0
but then i saw it			0
sure , i had seen the commercials , but i did n't fully appreciate the beauty of the @entity2 until i saw it in person			1
at that moment , i vowed that nothing would stand in my way of getting my hands on one -- except the hundreds of people standing on line in front of me at the @entity69			0
my first @entity2 had me at " @entity70			1
" actually , there were a lot of dropped calls in those days , so technically it had me at : " can you hear me now ? " but hey , we were young			0
neither of us knew what we were doing or where it would lead			0
but we agreed to give it a shotâ € ” a one - year shot , to be precise , per the terms of my service agreement			0
that amazing year flew by			0
before you knew it , the @entity84 arrived			0
it looked like the original , but was faster			0
it could do things the first @entity2 could n't			1
in defense of my first @entity2 , it would have gladly done these other things if it were technologically capable			1
@entity47 : @entity93 and @entity94 shine as @entity2 sales sink then in june 2010 came the biggest moment of our relationship : the @entity2 4			1
just as @entity99 promised : " this changes everything			0
" it felt like 2007 all over again			0
the new @entity2 was sleeker			1
those were probably the best days of our relationship			0
texting , e-mailing , surfing the internet while speaking on the phone			0
even our worst moment , the time i accidentally dropped the @entity2 in the toilet bowl , did n't slow us down			1
despite everyone saying my @entity2 would never be the same after this incident , it was better than ever			1
maybe it was foolish to think that this bliss would last forever			0
the first time i sensed something was wrong was in mid- 2011			0
june 7 , if i recall correctly			0
that 's when the @entity120 was announced			1
i had hoped for an @entity2			1
a fully redesigned , greatly improved @entity2			1
instead it was just a slightly faster version of the same old thing			0
maybe my expectations were to blame ? maybe it was @entity128 's fault ? but in any event , my feelings sadly began to fade that summer			2
since then , i have found myself increasingly checking out the @entity131 and @entity41			1
i 'm not saying i 'm moving on			2
even though the thrill might be gone , there 's a comfort to being with something you know well			2
but there is no longer passion			0
i feel like i 'm just going through the motions			2
i mechanically dial phone numbers or mindlessly type texts			0
i do n't even scream at @entity128 anymore when she says : " sorry , @entity142 , i do n't understand what you 're asking			0
" i know it 's just a matter of time before it ends			2
but i want to make it clear that i 'm not going to break my commitment			2
that 's my word -- plus there 's a $ 350 early termination penalty			2
however , when i 'm eligible for a new phone in six months , i ca n't promise i 'll stay with my @entity2			1
but if i do buy a new phone , i 'll probably change my service carrier to help me forget			0
not that i 'll ever be able to			0
regardless of how this turns out , @entity12 will always be grateful to my @entity2 for being the first to show me what a real phone could do			1
tech : 5 ways the @entity2 changed our lives the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			1

@entity167 : my @entity2 has been great to me , but i 'm getting *restless*
he says he 's losing interest in the rumors of a new @entity2
he 's even *flirting* with the " younger @entity41 "
