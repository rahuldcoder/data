-- before the thousands of passengers and crew of the snakebit @entity3 debarked friday , an investigation into what went wrong had already begun			1
" we started the investigation right after we were notified sunday " that the ship 's engine room had caught fire , cutting all but generator power to the floating city , said @entity6 , a senior marine investigator for the @entity7			1
initially , investigators got engineering schematics for the vessel from @entity3 , @entity6 told @entity0			1
because the @entity3 is a @entity20 - flagged vessel , the @entity18 is the primary investigative agency , and will work with the @entity7 and the @entity21			1
@entity7 investigators boarded the vessel thursday as it headed to port to get passengers ' accounts of what happened and how it was handled , he said			1
investigators have already pulled the voyage data recorder -- a device that records alarms , voice communications on the bridge , engine speed , navigation information and rudder angle , said @entity6			0
the probe will likely take eight to 12 months to complete , he said			0
' amazing ' crew handled icky jobs on crippled cruise ship though the investigation into the cause of the fire in one of the ship 's two engine rooms is just beginning , @entity6 said it appears that the fire suppression worked as it was designed to do			1
the engineer who was on watch at around dawn on sunday saw the fire ignite over a video feed and immediately notified the bridge , @entity6 said			1
" he saw the flash ; that 's what alerted him			0
" he continued , " fire doors closed , the extinguishing systems worked , the fire was extinguished , it was kept closed as it is supposed to be so that the fire can cool down			1
" @entity62 filed over ' floating hell ' cruise based on an inspection thursday of the engine room , the fire did not appear to have been large , @entity6 said			1
" it was just a fire that was , apparently , in the right place			1
" though the crew might have been able to restore power to the vessel by firing up the generators in the ship 's other engine room , @entity6 said the ship 's engineers made the right call in not doing so			1
" really , the safe thing to do was to tow the vessel back into port rather than re-energize the power system that was damaged by fire , " he said			2
he said the listing ship was never in danger of exploding or of capsizing , as some passengers had feared			2
fuel tanks are kept far from the engine rooms and the vessel , which began tilting when the power loss led its plane stabilizers to stop working , listed only about 5 degrees from the wind			2
@entity6 commended the ship 's 1,086 crew members , saying they went to great lengths to meet passengers ' needs -- including redirecting emergency power to certain parts of ship to provide occasional water and toilet service			1
" the crew did an excellent job , from what we saw above and below decks and , over all i think , they accomplished their mission as far as safety goes : they brought everybody back safe			2
" tears and big hugs as passengers reunite with families passengers , too , praised the crew			1
many said they bent over backward to meet the needs of passengers , performing well even during unpleasant jobs such as cleaning the raw waste that had sloshed out of toilets			1
" they served us with smiles , and served us in ways that are truly unthinkable , the things they had to do for us , yet they did it with smiles , " said passenger @entity125 , wearing a @entity3 bathrobe with " @entity127 " scrawled on the back			1
investigators will look into passenger reports from previous cruises of the @entity3 that noted " some mechanical issues , " @entity6 said			1
" they may be completely unrelated to this , " he said			0
meanwhile , busloads of passengers departed @entity144 on friday for their homes			2
among the passengers arriving in @entity147 , @entity148 , were @entity149 and @entity150 of @entity151 , @entity152 , on their first trip away from the kids -- a cruise that the husband got his wife for @entity158			2
their souvenir ? a bag of stinky clothes and a new appreciation for each other			0
" there 's no way i could have made it without him , " @entity150 said			0
as the former passengers spoke , tugboats pulled the crippled @entity3 to a @entity144 , @entity171 , shipyard for repair			1
the ship wo n't resume cruises until at least mid-april			0
opinion : my celebration trip on the @entity3 : from joy to misery nightmare vacation the @entity3 's more than 3,100 passengers were in their third day of a planned four - day cruise from @entity147 to @entity183 when a fire in an engine room left it with no propulsion , adrift in the @entity187			1
the power outages put toilets out of order and the listing caused many of them to overflow , sending urine and feces sloshing across floors and down hallways			2
passengers reported long lines for food , shortages of fresh water and widespread boredom			1
many passengers slept in hallways or outside to escape the odors and heat below decks			2
five things we 've learned about cruising late thursday , @entity3 ceo @entity212 apologized on behalf of the company			1
" we pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience , and clearly we failed in this particular case , " he told reporters before boarding the ship to apologize in person			0
but for passenger @entity221 , it was too little too late			0
" the hallways were toxic , " said @entity222 , who vowed never to go on another carnival cruise			0
if that ship caught on fire and they had not contained it , where would we be ? floating in the ocean or dead			2
" others were more forgiving			0
" they did a good job of managing expectations , " @entity235 said			0
" the information that trickled out was probably well - thought - out to kind of keep people safe and calm			0
" @entity240 and @entity241 said their experience was different from that of passengers in the lower - level rooms			2
their balcony room had ample fresh air			0
@entity250 said she took dance classes offered by the crew and the couple spent much of their time " chilling			2
" " it was pretty slow , " @entity241 agreed			0
opinion : the dirty secrets below decks fallout carnival has offered to give each passenger $ 500 , a free flight home , a full refund for the trip and for most expenses incurred on board , as well as credit for another cruise			2
travelers have few options for compensation in these cases , other than what the cruise line is already offering , according to travel expert @entity276 of @entity278 , a travel website			0
" the passengers on the ship are n't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home , " he said			1
travel " insurance really does n't cover this sort of thing			0
their trip was n't interrupted and they are n't incurring extra expenses ... so they ca n't be compensated that way			0
" but the resulting @entity295 could hurt carnival , he said			0
" i think people will think twice about taking a cruise , " @entity276 said			0
after a bad cruise , can you cruise into court ? previous problems the fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late january , when it had an issue with its propulsion system , according to a notice posted on the website of carnival senior cruise director @entity311			2
it 's also not the first fire to disable one of the cruise line 's ships			0
in 2010 , the @entity317 lost power after an engine room fire , leaving it adrift off @entity183 's @entity320			0
the ship was towed to @entity322			0
opinion : how @entity3 can clean up the pr mess @entity325 and @entity326 were on the @entity317 when it lost power in 2010			1
they said watching coverage of the @entity3 passengers ' ordeal was " like looking in a mirror			1
" " it 's like deja vu , " @entity325 said			0
she said they took the free cruise offered by @entity3 after the 2010 debacle			1
despite walking the halls of the ship recounting things that had happened , she said they were determined to enjoy the trip			0
but what happened aboard the @entity3 , she said , has sealed their decision when it comes to cruising : they wo n't be going again			1
why did the rescue take so long ? @entity0 's @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 and @entity363 contributed to this report .			0
