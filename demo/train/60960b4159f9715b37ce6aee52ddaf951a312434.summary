@entity1 , which achieved more than $ 240 billion in gross merchandise volume last year -- more than that of @entity9 and @entity10 combined -- has become one of the largest technology companies in the world			1
that @entity1 is a @entity16 company has important implications and begs the question : will @entity16 become the next @entity19 , a breeding ground for the next generation of technology giants ? @entity19 has long led the world in the quality , quantity and diversity of technology startups it incubates			1
companies like @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 have flourished under @entity19 's mature and complete startup ecosystem , with its open and free market and culture and innovative environment			2
the picture is quite different in @entity39 where thus far , only a few large technology companies have emerged			1
@entity1 , @entity41 and @entity42 were not nurtured in a @entity19 type environment , but they are successful examples from the unique @entity16 market			1
opportunities with more than 1.3 billion people , @entity16 is not only the world 's largest country , but also its biggest consumer market			1
home to a huge number of factories , manufacturers , suppliers and customers , @entity16 is also called the " @entity56			2
" this unique demand and supply environment helps reduce businesses ' transaction costs and , indirectly , retail prices , creating a world of opportunities for entrepreneurs from @entity16 and abroad			2
often called the " @entity9 of @entity16 , " @entity1 's business model is in fact completely different from that of the online retail giant			1
@entity1 's @entity69 is not in itself an online shop but an open ecommerce platform where millions of small businesses and suppliers can sell directly to individual or business customers			1
unlike @entity9 , which charges commissions on transactions , @entity1 does not incur administrative charges on sellers or buyers ; instead , it offers sellers paid advertising opportunities that will allow their products to stand out among the thousands of others on the platform			0
@entity1 's success stems from its huge traffic and competitive retail prices			1
this competitive weapon piggybacks on another factor : @entity16 customers are the most active online shoppers in the world , shopping an average of 8.4 times online each month , far outpacing @entity5 customers , who shop 5.2 times			2
repeated transactions by these customers contribute significantly to a steady sales volume and to @entity1 's success in @entity16			1
everything to know about @entity1 challenges opportunities come with challenges			0
the greatest challenge for entrepreneurs in @entity16 is the protection of intellectual property			2
@entity69 is flooded with defective and counterfeit products : 82 % of products labeled with the @entity111 brand on @entity69 are fakes , and the brand has had to get up to 3,000 listings taken down a month			0
this is a rather unique problem in @entity16 , unlikely to be found in other parts of the world			0
without a strong legal system , copyright infringement is becoming a natural tendency			0
unless a product is very difficult to duplicate , it is likely to be copied in @entity16			0
these skillful and efficient perpetrators make such convincing cloned products that they often surpass the original on many levels			0
in a way , this is stifling creativity and innovation -- innovations are being copied , rather than respected and protected			0
in addition , government policies such as taxation and embargoes may be changed or imposed at anytime , without reasonable explanation and without channels or methods of reverting the decision			0
any such unexpected policy changes may have significant impact on businesses , and are interpreted as one of the biggest risk factors of doing business in @entity16			2
despite adequate talent and capital , the closed market prevents local businesses from competing globally			0
business owners who are not @entity16 or do not have local connections face a much greater risk of failure			0
because of the reasons above , i do n't believe it is realistic to compare @entity16 to @entity19			0
rather , it can be described as " a separate world " where one can thrive only with a good knowledge about the rules of the game			0
@entity1 is an example of a company that has achieved a " cultural fit " in @entity16			1
but whether @entity1 or other homegrown @entity16 technology companies can hold their place in the competitive global market , or surpass the @entity19 - bred giants , remains to be seen			1
read this : the social apps taking @entity16 by storm read this : @entity16 tech hopefuls challenge heavyweights the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

@entity1 's public offering raises questions about the future of tech startups in @entity16
to date , very few large @entity16 technology companies have emerged
@entity1 owes its success to @entity16 's high shopping rates and large consumer market
@entity177 believes that @entity16 's counterfeit culture is the company 's biggest challenge
