violent extremists like the self - proclaimed @entity1 , or @entity1 , have become increasingly sophisticated at creating dense , global networks of support online , networks that are helping these groups run virtual circles around governments and communities			1
and it is activities like these that have raised a disturbing prospect , one that has serious implications for fighting extremism : we could lose the information war			1
it 's with this troubling reality in mind that the @entity23 administration will this week hold a @entity24 , where it will underscore the importance of technology companies in the fight against terrorist recruitment			1
as @entity34 , director of @entity36 's @entity35 ( the @entity37 's sister organization ) , emphasized , technology companies ' services " have become the command - and - control networks of choice for terrorists			2
" @entity1 , in particular , has proven virulent in using technology to radicalize			1
it has mobilized armies of online followers to engage audiences in ways that take advantage of the decentralized and open nature of the @entity48 , leveraging online tools such as @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , to name just a few			1
indeed , in a single day this past summer , @entity1 supporters sent out some 40,000 tweets , and supporters often repetitively tweet specific hashtags at particular times of day to maximize message trending			1
@entity1 also has strategically run hashtag campaigns to tap into trending topics on @entity50 , such as the @entity64 and @entity65 , which have nothing to do with violent extremism			1
@entity1 - linked extremists have used social media to focus group messages , disseminate ideological simulator games , and broadcast high production videos , and the group has created its own technologies , including a smartphone app released last year that amplifies its messaging campaigns			1
governments are struggling to keep up			2
how should they respond ? for a start , they need to leverage the talent , creativity and capabilities of the private sector			2
yet involving technology companies in countering extremism will be challenging			2
true , the @entity89 government has been engaging @entity90 , @entity50 , @entity51 and other large companies on the problem since at least 2008			1
but while this has generated a few initiatives , such as social media training for @entity97 and the @entity99 online network catalyzed by @entity100 , we have yet to see the scale of involvement required for strategic impact			2
part of the challenge is that , although large companies clearly want to help , they have to navigate complicated priorities that distinguish them from governments , such as shareholders , profits , brands and market forces			2
just as importantly , these high - profile companies could face real safety risks			2
when @entity50 shut down @entity1 - affiliated accounts last year , for example , a prominent @entity1 supporter called for the assassination of @entity50 employees			1
given recent attacks in @entity123 and @entity124 , these kinds of threats are chilling			0
the @entity23 administration will therefore need to figure out how to help companies navigate the inherent risks of the private sector countering violent extremism			0
one solution is to encourage the involvement of more agile start - ups that are willing to move into niche markets like countering extremist messaging			0
these companies are lean , hungry and less encumbered by the risk calculations that circumscribe large companies			0
moreover , the start - up community is increasingly emphasizing social impact as a core business imperative , and this trend likely will accelerate as more millennials start new businesses			0
interestingly , research shows that millennials place a premium on investments that generate positive social impact			0
just as importantly , the counter-extremism " marketplace " is in many ways better suited to small , flexible businesses than large companies			0
radicalization is driven by a host of different factors ( such as identity crises , a sense of disempowerment , a desire for adventure , and even misguided idealism ) , each of which represents a potential business opportunity			0
large companies may not be interested in addressing these market needs if it takes them away from their core products and services , leaving room for a constellation of specialized start - ups			0
the @entity175 youth market , in particular , is experiencing immense political , cultural and religious transformations , and many large companies are nervous about the volatility			0
as a result , the 500 million - strong @entity175 youth market is woefully underserved			0
start - ups , especially those from within @entity175 communities , may be better positioned and motivated to address @entity175 youth needs in a way that helps counter radicalization			0
at the @entity189 , the president will likely call on technology companies for help , and we encourage the administration to involve talented and passionate start - ups in addition to brand name companies			1
this week , to support the summit and facilitate greater private sector involvement , we will launch a specialized start - up incubator ( @entity200 ) and are forming a $ 5 million private equity fund for start - ups involved in countering extremism			1
the reality is that @entity1 operates like a mission - driven , agile start - up to spread its evil ideology , and we will not defeat it through government and large corporations alone			1
@entity89 is the vanguard of entrepreneurship and innovation , and there are start - ups ready to heed president @entity23 's call , including start - ups led by passionate @entity97 who are building businesses and social enterprises that challenge violent extremist narratives			0
we believe firmly that @entity89 entrepreneurs are ready to support the fight against radicalization .			0

@entity189 is holding @entity189 on @entity224 this week
@entity1 has run hashtag campaigns to tap into trending topics on @entity50
