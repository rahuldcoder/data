-- wednesday is the 100th anniversary of @entity3 's birth			1
he remains a controversial figure , and not just on the political left			2
last year , i was covering the @entity8 in @entity9 when i came across a stall selling old political pins			0
unable to resist , i bought one with a picture of @entity3 giving his best crocodile smile beneath the classic slogan " @entity3 @entity15 ! " i slipped it on at a party later that evening and was surprised by the results			1
none of the young conservative activists had a nice word to say about @entity3 and many were quite hostile			1
to them , he was the archetypal @entity25 -- a liberal in conservative clothing			0
while most @entity29 probably remember him only for @entity30 or @entity31 -- and many liberals still revile him as a war - bating , divisive anti-communist -- from a conservative perspective his politics were disappointingly moderate			1
he 's a reminder of an older , more centrist kind of @entity37 , the kind you do n't see very much these days			1
it feels today like the @entity37 is fighting a series of rear guard actions -- on the fiscal cliff , on guns and on @entity46 's nominations			1
that 's partly a reflection of political reality ; they lost the presidential election and only control the @entity52			2
but a common theme running through each of these battles is " inflexibility			0
" they seem unwilling to yield either to president @entity46 's post-election authority or to the popular mood			1
of course , principle is an admirable quality			0
but it wo n't necessarily win the @entity52 in 2016			0
a lesson in the benefits of adapting to circumstances might be taken from the life of @entity3			1
in domestic policy , @entity3 bowed to the liberal consensus of his era			1
he supported the @entity70 , founded the @entity71 and was a proponent of the poverty - fighting measure of guaranteed income			1
he also established the first federal affirmative action program - the @entity76 , which required government contractors in @entity78 to hire minority construction workers			0
as was so often the case with @entity3 's public compassion , this served a private purpose of outflanking his opponents			1
his environmentalism was designed to deny the issue to liberals ; his support of affirmative action divided them			0
the @entity76 was opposed by many @entity90 , not just by @entity92 conservatives but also by labor leaders who saw it as a challenge to seniority programs			0
it set unions and civil rights activists against each other , while the president grabbed a little credit for being progressive			0
even on foreign policy , the record is a complex mix of hawk and dove			0
@entity3 said he wanted " peace with honor " in @entity31 , which meant concluding the conflict in such a way that did n't undermine @entity29 military or political credibility			1
this translated into a perverse policy of extending the war to end it -- bombing @entity116 to a point of social anarchy that would lead , inexorably , to the genocide of the @entity120			0
opinion : @entity37 's obstructionism is suicide strategy but @entity3 won re-election in 1972 partly on a reputation as a peacemaker with whom the @entity90 could not compete			1
his visit to @entity129 began the slow process of integrating the @entity131 into the rest of the world , and it put pressure on the @entity135 to go further on detente			0
in 1973 , the administration helped @entity138 resist an @entity140 invasion by ( belatedly ) supplying arms			0
when that war was concluded , @entity3 was widely regarded as having saved the world from a superpower confrontation in the @entity145 and he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds in @entity147			1
but , by that point , his reputation at home had been so scarred by his involvement in the watergate break - in that he could n't capitalize on his image as a global problem solver			0
@entity3 was his own worst enemy			2
beyond his foxing of opponents , @entity3 was not without a personal manifesto			2
he was saving his more conservative policies for after his re-election			0
had @entity30 not reduced his political capital so early in 1973 , there 's a chance @entity3 would have pushed ahead with his agenda of a @entity165 and undone much of the liberalism of his first term			1
the @entity165 was similar to what would later become @entity169 : tax cuts , more power to the states , welfare reform			0
@entity3 , then , was a mix of ideals and prejudices , but all tempered by a respect for the possibilities and limitations of power			2
aside from @entity30 , that 's why he 's so unpopular with the contemporary conservative movement			1
while it 's true that the @entity37 continues to nominate moderates ( from @entity186 to @entity187 ) , in recent decades they 've been expected to pass a test of ideological purity put to them by a restive base that invariably shifts the candidates ' platform to the right			1
@entity3 also did his best to court conservatives , but his instinct was always to anchor himself in the rhetorical center			2
as president , his ambition to build a permanent @entity199 depended upon walking a line between the radicalism of the left and the racialism of the far right			0
his strategy was n't built entirely upon pursuing @entity92 racists , as many liberal critics have suggested			0
had it been so , he would n't have been re-elected in 1972 by winning every single state but @entity210			0
the fact is that @entity3 was often very popular with a lot of regular @entity29			1
in 1968 , he even took 36 % of the black vote , a much stronger performance than @entity187 's paltry 6 %			2
today , it 's difficult to talk about @entity3 as a model for contemporary republicans because his political reputation is so tarnished			1
but he does offer an interesting alternative electoral strategy to that pursued by the contemporary right and embodied by the mythically consistent @entity222 ( the @entity223 was more moderate than his fans admit )			0
and the test of how well @entity3 's pragmatism worked is measured in his electoral victories			1
despite his two memorable defeats in 1960 and 1962 ( " you wo n't have @entity3 to kick around anymore " ) , he won election as a @entity52 representative , a senator , a vice president and a president			2
considering that record , moderate republicans in pursuit of the @entity52 have every cause to get misty - eyed when they hear the name @entity3			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : wednesday is 100th anniversary of @entity3 's birth
he says @entity37 could take a page from @entity3 on adapting . @entity3 was good at getting elected
he says @entity3 was *politcially* strategic : backed @entity70 , poverty fighting measures , founded @entity71
@entity241 : without @entity30 , he *'d* likely still be popular
