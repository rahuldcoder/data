-- in travels this week -- to @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 -- friends and strangers alike have said the same thing : they are turned off and tuned out of the sequestration mess in @entity10			1
to a person , they are sick of the antics of those to whom they have entrusted enormous power			0
in times past , a president has usually risen to the demands of leadership when a @entity21 has stubbornly resisted tough choices , such as the upcoming mandatory budget cuts that are called sequestration			1
that 's what @entity26 did in persuading key republicans to help pass the civil rights bills of 1964 and 1965			1
and that 's what @entity31 did in working with a @entity33 led by @entity34			0
people forget how hostile @entity36 were to @entity31 -- hell , they impeached him -- but he nonetheless worked with them to pass four straight balanced budgets and an overhaul of welfare			1
@entity41 signs order activating " dumb " budget cuts in other times , @entity21 has displayed serious leadership when a president has lost his way			1
that 's what @entity21 did to curtail overseas military ventures after two presidents in a row got us into a quagmire in @entity54			1
and that 's what top congressmen like @entity57 and @entity58 did when @entity60 went off the tracks in @entity62			0
but today , we have a rare moment when both @entity21 and the president are retreating from their responsibilities			1
it 's hard to recall a time when we were so leaderless			2
one of the foremost duties of @entity21 is to pass a budget : it has failed for four straight years			1
republicans , especially in the @entity33 , have continually refused to meet the @entity72 halfway			0
meanwhile , a president who promised to be a solution has become part of the problem			2
ever since his re-election , @entity41 has seemed more intent on campaigning than governing			0
a new @entity82 / @entity81 poll gives some measure of how the public is turning away			0
only one in four @entity85 is following news of the sequester			1
and as @entity94 and @entity95 wrote in tuesday 's @entity82 , " not only are most people paying very little attention to the sequester , they also have only the faintest sense of what it would do			0
fewer than one in five , or 18 % , in the @entity98 poll say they understand ' very well ' what would happen if the sequester went into effect			0
" @entity94 and @entity95 argue that far more people paid attention to the fiscal cliff because their taxes might go up			0
fair enough , but in my conversations , people were mostly fed up with the soap opera			0
what to do ? last weekend in @entity113 , voters were so disgusted with their politicians that an upstart political movement led by a political comedian won the most votes of any single party			2
is it time to draft @entity120 and @entity121 ? perhaps , but in the meantime , the president and the @entity21 have one solemn and urgent responsibility : having created this mess , they must -- stress must -- work together to minimize the disruptions and hardships that they are promising will happen			1
it is insane that a series of cuts that represent only 2.5 % of all federal spending and 5 % of the budgets of most federal agencies will be allowed -- according to the administration -- to create havoc with airplane flights , bring grinding slowdowns to meat inspections , force an aircraft carrier to stay in port ... the litany goes on			0
to anyone who has been through numerous short shutdowns of government in the past , this sounds suspiciously like the " @entity149 syndrome " : the tendency of federal bureaucrats faced with budget cuts to shut down the most visible services first , causing screams and forcing the cuts to be rescinded			2
administration spokesmen say their hands are tied by the sequestration law because it requires even , across - the - board cuts			2
but if that is the case , change the law			0
everyone knows it is a stupid piece of legislation			0
fortunately , some senators on both sides of the aisle -- @entity33 @entity169 of @entity170 and @entity172 @entity171 of @entity173 among them -- are working on legislation that would give the administration flexibility in making the cuts so that disruptions can be kept as small as possible			2
so far , the @entity72 and majority leader @entity179 are saying no. the @entity72 has made the argument that minimizing the effects would make people too complacent about what comes from reducing spending			0
in reality , what they are trying to do is to make @entity188 look so bad that they will cave in			0
this is a terrible way to govern : @entity10 politicians should not turn citizens into suffering pawns in order to get their way			0
meanwhile , republicans like @entity196 are objecting that such a correction to the sequestration law would cede too much power to the president			1
the concern about excessive power is legitimate , but surely a way can be found so that the @entity72 and @entity21 would share power and any other arrangements be strictly limited in time			1
perhaps , if wisdom once again rears its head , this mess will be so awful the president and @entity21 will get back to the bargaining table and come up with a long - term solution			1
but in the meantime , @entity41 and @entity21 have a duty to lead -- and that means to pass a bill that will minimize disruption and pain			1
by the way , speaking of comedians as politicians , @entity218 has turned out to be a pretty darn good senator			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1

@entity225 says everyone he talks to is turned off by mandatory budget cut mess
@entity225 : we are leaderless ; neither @entity21 nor president is taking responsibility
most @entity85 have no idea of what " sequestration " means or what it will do , he says
@entity225 : all sides are using this as a political scare *tactic* ; they have a duty to pass a bill
