-- the streaking ball of fire friday night above the @entity2 did not , alas , signal the end to civilization as we know it			2
though you might get that sense from social media			1
the sky lit up along the @entity10 @entity2 with reports of " a thin streak of blue - greenish - white " from people like @entity14 , who was driving in eastern @entity15 when he and his family he spotted it			2
" it did n't last more than eight or nine seconds , then it disappeared , " said @entity14 , a spokesman for @entity18 , @entity19			0
" frankly , i did n't think too much of it			0
" but his tune changed once he posted something about the presumed meteor on a local social media web page , which triggered a quick and hearty response			1
welcome to the year of the comet that was just the tip of the online iceberg			0
through friday night , new reports of meteor sightings appeared every few seconds on @entity34 , some of them from the metropolises of @entity37 and @entity38			1
" omg i saw a real meteor in the @entity44 's sky , " wrote one person on @entity34 , with the handle @entity41			2
" it 's all over the news now ! i thought it is some kind of firework ... " the @entity49 fielded calls about a meteor from @entity52 to @entity53 , said agency spokeswoman @entity54			1
so what exactly was it ? @entity57 , a spokesman for @entity58 , said his agency heard about the sightings , too , and can confirm it was not from anything man - made , such as a plane or falling satellite			2
on saturday , @entity64 from @entity66 's @entity65 explained that the bright , fast - flying object was , in fact , a meteor			1
the space agency 's @entity70 defines a meteor as " light phenomena " from a meteoroid -- which is itself a comet or asteroid orbiting the sun -- that " enters the @entity79 's atmosphere and vaporizes			1
" it made for quite a show , producing a fireball as bright as a full moon and spurring more than 630 visual reports to be submitted to the @entity85 , as it soared southwest into the @entity86			1
but just because it was bright does n't mean it was big			2
the meteor was one yard in diameter , about the size of an exercise ball , when it entered the atmosphere over eastern @entity95 , said @entity64			1
that 's still big enough potentially to produce meteorites -- which are meteoroids , or fragments thereof , that do manage to hit the @entity79 -- before burning completely			0
if it did , though , they fell harmlessly into the @entity86 , according to @entity64			1
as anyone who has seen a shooting star can attest , it 's hardly unprecedented for otherworldly objects to enter the @entity79 's atmosphere			0
and some of them do strike our planet , though they tend to be small when they do and strike unpopulated areas on land or plunge into the world 's oceans			0
there are exceptions , like the massive asteroid that many experts believe killed off dinosaurs			0
more recently , a meteor exploded over the steppes of southwestern @entity122 on february 15 , a blast that scientists at @entity126 's @entity125 estimated had the energy of about 30 early nuclear bombs			0
the related flash and boom shattered glass in buildings and left about 1,000 people hurt , authorities said			0
there were no confirmed reports friday night that the greenish streak spotted by so many actually impacted anywhere			1
even if it did n't , the mere possibility was enough to send chills down some stargazers ' spines			0
" seriously , after that massive meteor in @entity152 a few weeks ago , the one that hit @entity122 , and now this hugee one tonight , " wrote a @entity34 user by the name of @entity145 , referring to the @entity122 incident and a mass shooting star sighting on the @entity148 last night			2
" read more space and science news on @entity156 @entity0 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			0

new : the streak , as bright as a full moon , was a meteor 1 yard in diameter , @entity66 says
new : it entered the atmosphere over @entity95 , *heading* toward the @entity86
