@entity0 -- a new book about former sen. @entity3 paints him as a cold , calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter , risking his marriage and putting the @entity7 in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency			1
in " the politician , " former @entity3 ' aide @entity11 details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out - of - wedlock			1
" @entity19 " went on sale saturday			0
@entity11 described an elaborate plan that allowed @entity3 to maintain a mistress while he sought the @entity7 presidential nomination in 2008			1
the plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors , the late trial lawyer @entity24 and banking heir widow @entity25 , but @entity25 was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress			0
a federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator 's campaign and supporters made to @entity33 , who was a videographer as @entity3 was preparing a bid for 2008 @entity36 run			1
in the book , @entity11 writes that " the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written , the way the money was used and the timing of events			1
they wanted names , dates , and amounts in very specific terms			0
" @entity11 , who portrays himself as a one - time idealistic loyal aide , said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for @entity3 and @entity51 and helped to keep the affair a secret			1
and when @entity3 impregnated @entity51 , @entity11 said he agreed to the senator 's request to lie and say he was the father even though @entity11 , himself , was married with three children			1
@entity11 said he told his wife about agreeing to @entity3 ' request as the couple drove through a @entity62 's drive through to pick up food for their son			1
" after i finally got to holler for @entity66 with chocolate milk and the right toy , i turned to @entity69 and in the time it took us to reach window number one ( where you give them the money ) , i said , ' @entity3 wants me to say i 'm the father of @entity33 's baby , and then @entity24 's gon na fly us off to someplace where we can all hide , ' " @entity11 said			1
his wife , @entity11 recounted , was dumbfounded			2
" are you out of your mind ? why would you even tell me about this ? why did n't you just say no ? " @entity11 said @entity51 was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met			1
his wife , @entity69 , eventually agreed to the plan , setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in @entity94 and criss - crossed the country with @entity51 and their children in an effort to evade the media			2
@entity3 denied that he was the girl 's father for more than a year , saying the affair was over before @entity51 became pregnant			1
last week , he acknowledged paternity			0
" i am @entity106 's father , " @entity3 said in a statement			2
" i have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace			0
" @entity3 and his wife , @entity114 , have legally separated			2
on friday , @entity3 ' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with @entity11 's account			1
" while we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book , we urge extreme caution by everyone involved , " his attorneys wrote			0
" from media reports , it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false			0
it appears that @entity11 is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention			2
" earlier in the week , @entity135 also challenged accusations @entity11 made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple 's children			1
" @entity114 is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her , " her publisher @entity142 said in a statement			0
" it was an excrutiatingly ( sic ) painful period for her and she ( has ) no interest in rehashing the past			0
based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available , it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations			2
" she will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges , but would like to set the record straight on two key points			0
first , the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable , hurtful and patently false			0
" second , she believed @entity11 to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity ( sic ) to her this past summer			2
she will have nothing further to say			0
" in the book , @entity11 accuses @entity135 of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility			1
@entity11 said it was n't until @entity3 privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter , @entity175 , in february 2008 , that he realized the former senator cared only about himself			1
" after watching and hearing @entity3 practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies , ostensibly in the service of some greater good , i finally recognized that he did n't care about anyone other than himself , " @entity11 writes			1
" a precious living , breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world , and he was n't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her			0
instead , i had to prompt him to do the right thing , to do the most basic , human thing			0
" my faith in him died almost instantly , and i felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family			0
" @entity11 also writes that : he has a sex tape of @entity3 in his possession showing the senator with a " naked pregnant woman " that @entity11 says is @entity51			1
@entity11 said he found the damaged tape in " a box of trash that @entity33 had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks " in the @entity203 , @entity94 , home his family was renting			1
@entity11 writes that even though the woman 's face is obscured " it was safe to assume it was @entity33			1
" despite @entity3 ' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people , he was " irritated by ordinary events			0
he especially hated making appearances at state fairs , where ' fat rednecks try to shove food down my face			0
i know i 'm the people 's senator , but do i have to hang out with them ? ' " @entity3 understood his audience and before appearing at a @entity221 health care event in @entity222 , @entity223 , he instructed @entity224 to take his @entity226 suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was @entity226 - made			2
in its place , @entity3 had the tailor sew in a " @entity234 " label that had been on @entity11 's jacket			2
when @entity3 was not on the @entity236 diet , he " loved @entity239 " restaurants as well as ribs			0
@entity3 thought that 2004 @entity7 presidential nominee @entity240 " just was n't all that smart			0
" @entity240 , a senator from @entity241 , would later pick @entity3 to be his vice presidential running mate .			0
