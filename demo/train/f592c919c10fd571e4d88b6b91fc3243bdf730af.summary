@entity0 -- the case of a convicted rapist paroled in 1999 has come back to haunt @entity5 presidential candidate @entity4 , with the mother of a woman the convict later murdered pledging to campaign against the former @entity10 governor			1
@entity4 says he did not try to influence the @entity12 board to parole @entity13			1
@entity4 , during his first term as @entity10 governor , expressed support for the parole of @entity13 in a letter to him			1
@entity13 was serving a life sentence for raping a 17 - year - old girl			0
the @entity10 parole board had the final say on @entity13 's parole			1
less than a year after his release from prison in 1999 , @entity13 was accused of raping and murdering @entity27 , a woman in @entity28 , @entity29			1
@entity13 was convicted of the crime in 2003			0
he died in prison in 2005			0
@entity4 on sunday confirmed to @entity1 he had sent the letter to @entity13			2
the murdered woman 's mother , @entity33 , said she will " absolutely campaign against " @entity4 , and said she decided to come forward when he started doing well in the polls			1
" it 's because he is a serious contender , " @entity36 said			0
" i did n't think he had a chance , but now he 's right up there in @entity42			0
" in an interview with @entity1 wednesday , @entity4 said it was " heartbreaking " that the murders had become politicized			2
" there are families who are truly , understandably and reasonably , grief stricken , " @entity4 said			2
" and for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families , i just regret politics is reduced to that			0
" @entity4 said he had considered granting @entity61 clemency , but he dropped the idea in response to public outcry			2
@entity4 also said he did not grant clemency because he wanted to ensure @entity13 was supervised when he was released from prison			2
" had i granted his commutation , then there would have been no supervision at all , " @entity4 said , " i was n't comfortable with that			2
" the @entity13 case began in 1985 , when he was accused of raping a 17 - year - old girl			0
before trial , @entity13 was attacked in his home and castrated , and the local sheriff kept the severed testicles in a jar			0
no charges were brought in the attack			0
@entity4 said the process leading to @entity13 's release began under former president @entity82 when he was governor of @entity10			1
@entity82 and , later , @entity10 gov. @entity83 commuted part of @entity13 's sentence , @entity4 said , because they thought it was excessive			1
when he spoke about the case , @entity4 suggested his role in the decision to parole @entity13 was limited			1
@entity4 said it was the decision by @entity82 and @entity83 that made @entity13 eligible for parole , and @entity4 declined to reduce @entity13 's sentence further			1
in 1996 , @entity4 sent a letter to @entity13 saying parole was the best option for him , the @entity93 reported			1
" i 've never made a decision about the @entity13 case other than the decision to write the letter " to @entity13 , @entity4 said			2
" that was my decision , but i did n't parole him , because governors do n't parole people in @entity10			1
" however , @entity105 , a parole board member at the time , told @entity107 he felt pressure from @entity4 when the board considered @entity13 's parole in 1996			1
the @entity111 reported in 2002 that two other board members said they were influenced by @entity4 to parole @entity113			1
@entity4 denied he asked the board to approve @entity13 's parole			1
" no , i did not , " @entity4 said sunday			0
" let me categorically say i did not			0
" @entity4 said wednesday his discussion with the parole board in 1996 was a general discussion about clemency , not about the @entity13 case			1
@entity4 noted that the three board members who said they were pressured were appointed to the board by @entity121 and @entity83			1
documents posted on the web site @entity124 indicate @entity4 received letters from several victims of @entity13 before his release			0
the letters detailed his past actions and pleaded that he remain incarcerated			0
" i feel that if he is released it is only a matter of time before he commits another crime and fear that he will not leave a witness to testify against him the next time , " one victim wrote			0
she described how @entity13 had raped her at knifepoint			0
a former top @entity4 aide confirmed to @entity1 the then - governor received that letter and a follow - up phone call from the victim			2
in another letter , a woman documented how her mother was raped by @entity13 , and said he had told her mother he would rape her daughter if she did not cooperate			2
the @entity124 said it received the never - before - published letters from a " deeply troubled " former aide to @entity4 who believes the presidential candidate has " deliberately attempted to cover up his knowledge of @entity13 's other sexual assaults			0
" @entity4 spokeswoman @entity155 denied to the @entity124 that @entity4 received any of the letters , but later told @entity1 he got at least one from a victim named " @entity159 , " who lived in @entity161 , @entity10			1
it 's not clear if this is one of the letters posted on the @entity124 , because the site has redacted the names			0
the @entity124 has published three victims ' letters , and says it will post additional files later wednesday			0
e-mail to a friend @entity1 's @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
