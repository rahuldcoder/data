-- as a college professor who has talked to hundreds of women who are aiming to break the glass ceiling , i find that all the hubbub about paving the road to success by enlisting mentors , joining a support group , and simply learning to take it like a man misses a crucial point : young women are ambitious but worried about making it all happen			1
like clockwork , my female college students -- future doctors , lawyers , bankers , and computer programmers -- show up for office hours when course materials confront them with the realities of gender and family issues in the 21st century			1
the key questions on these minds of these twenty - something - year - olds are : will they ever be able to have kids if they pursue a career in medicine , law , banking , or high - tech ? should their @entity34 exclude kids altogether ? is there any hope that will not repeat the mistakes of mothers who opted out and found out they could n't opt back in when their children were grown ? is it really going to be that difficult ? even though these women are , statistically , years away from marriage and bearing children , and they have come to take careers and economic independence for granted , they know that work / family balance is a thorny subject			1
and they are worried about how -- and if -- they can have it all			0
opinion : do n't ask for all , ask what makes you happy so i do a little therapy with them			0
we start with the obvious : find a spouse who will split up the housework ; ( the research is on their side ; @entity65 men are pulling much more weight at home than ever before )			1
we talk about delaying childbearing			0
we talk about finding the " right fit			0
" but there 's no way to work around the elephant in the room : a supportive spouse , the right career choice , and delaying childbearing into their 30s wo n't help them figure out how to remain on the fast track when they 're aching not to miss their babies ' first steps or first day in kindergarten			1
10 views : our struggle to ' have it all ' " i do n't necessarily need to be there with cookie and milk everyday when my kids come home from school but i want to be a part of my kids ' lives			0
how can you do that if you 're working 12 hours a day ? " said one future doctor			1
she 's considering forgoing children altogether			2
and she 's not alone			0
@entity65 women are having fewer children and at later ages			1
a staggering number of them are deciding to not to have children			2
some pundits are worried , while others celebrate the diversity of choices			2
@entity112 , a sociologist at @entity113 interviewed young men and women about their perceptions of work - family issues before the real juggle began			1
she learned that both men and women were planning on equally sharing their work and home requirements			2
however , there was a persistent gender gap between these young , still childless men and women			1
their " @entity128 " varied widely : young men thought that if the equality ideal failed , their wives would be the ones to cut back on work			2
which brings us back to glass ceilings and shattered dreams			0
work , family and ' leaning in ' : seven families trying to make it work one particularly bright student , nearing graduation , reflected on how she has always felt equal to her male peers ; in fact , she out - performed them			1
" i was the total driven alpha male , " she said			0
she was thrilled to land a lucrative internship at a bio-tech research lab after her junior year			0
" and that 's when it hit me , " she said , of her choice , to rethink her career plans ; " i realized that i was never going to see daylight ! i mean , i was working with these brilliant people			2
but there was this young mother who always trying to get out early enough to spend time with her son ; and of course it almost never worked out			2
i mean the kid was fine , the dad picked him up from preschool			0
but watching her struggle really made me think			0
i always thought that i was just going to make it work			0
but now i 'm not so sure anymore			0
" she 's still heading out to a prestigious ph.d. program in the fall , but is now thinking of a less demanding career path			0
for a new generation of women , they are making rational choices			1
they understand that their ability to balance their lives has much more to do with what the @entity65 workplace of the future will look like than any of the choices they will make			1
the question remains : will the workplace of the future evolve for the better so that women wo n't have to worry anymore ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			1

@entity190 : my young college female students are ambitious and smart
@entity190 : but they worry about balancing family and career and whether to have children
she says the choices that these women plan to make are rational and realistic
@entity190 : much will depend on what the @entity65 workplace of the future look like
