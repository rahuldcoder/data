@entity1 - @entity0 -- from a distance , smoke rises over @entity1			2
it is about as close as most reporters can get to the battle zone			0
the world 's media have been camped on the @entity11 border with @entity1			1
@entity11 's media restrictions have prevented dozens of international journalists from entering @entity1 , where the jewish state is waging an operation against militant targets			1
international news media are forced to report on the more than two - week - old conflict from a hill near the @entity1 - @entity11 border			1
@entity2 relies on a local journalist in @entity1 , but can not send other reporters into the @entity24 territory			2
in addition , @entity25 is also not allowing journalists to cross its border into @entity1			2
" it 's really frustrating , you ca n't be there , see there and feel it , " said @entity2 's @entity29			0
" and you see these pictures from the hospital , but what 's happening behind the hospital ? what 's @entity41 doing ? " @entity11 has accused @entity41 militants of exploiting the deaths of civilians to garner international sympathy through the media			1
@entity29 pointed out that allowing reporters into @entity1 would give the world a more thorough picture of @entity11 's military operation			1
" the questions we would ask that go beyond the immediacy of the civilian casualties that you want to know about , but the other stuff that really informs you , " he said			0
it is a very different strategy from @entity11 's position during its 2006 war against @entity63 militants in @entity64			1
then , reporters were allowed to broadcast from @entity11 artillery positions			2
but this time , @entity11 has changed its tactics and is preventing international reporters from being embedded with the military to avoid interference in military operations , an @entity11 government spokesman said			1
" there was too much exposure , " @entity74 said			0
" it had an effect on our ability to achieve strategic goals , so that 's one of the lessons we learned from the war in @entity64			0
" some @entity11 journalists are embedded with the military in @entity1 but are not allowed to report from elsewhere			1
the @entity89 - based @entity88 -- of which @entity2 is a member -- is among several groups that have criticized the restrictions			0
" the unprecedented denial of access to @entity1 for the world 's media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of @entity11 in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs , " the association said in a january 6 statement			1
@entity108 , the head of the @entity109 in @entity1 , said the absence of journalists is preventing the truth from getting out			2
@entity115 , a spokesman for the @entity116 , @entity114 - based @entity113 , said the dangers of the current conflict do not override the need for media coverage			0
" of course it 's a dangerous place , of course journalists have to take the responsibilities and have to decide whether they want to go in or not and where they want to be , " @entity115 said			0
" but banning the press to enter @entity1 is just unacceptable			0
" almost two weeks into the operation , @entity11 did allow a western camera crew across the border			0
but footage shot by the @entity131 crew was subject to clearance by @entity11 military censors			2
images from inside @entity1 did filter out to the world from journalists based inside @entity1 who work for news agencies such as @entity138 and broadcasters like @entity140			1
inside @entity1 , @entity41 has controlled the images broadcast by the media , and pictures of suffering have been encouraged			1
but the outside world has seen very few images of @entity41 fighters or their rockets being fired into @entity11			1
both the @entity11 military and @entity41 have launched pages on the web site , @entity151			1
@entity152 says the shared video is " documentation of the @entity152 's humane action and operational success in @entity157			0
" @entity41 ' video shows graphic scenes from the fighting and also attacks its political rival , @entity162			0
in times of war , the line between winning and losing can come down to the public relations battle as much as the military offensive itself			0
but for journalists , it 's about finding a balance in the story -- a difficult task when they are unable to cover all the angles .			0
