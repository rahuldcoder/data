-- " i 've broken my shoulder , broken my knees , broken my feet , broken my hands , i 've broken ribs , i 've broken the coccyx in my back			0
" off - road bicycle racing is a rough and tumble world , and three - time bmx world champion @entity10 has suffered enough injuries to end any sporting career			1
fortunately for the @entity13 , she is made of stern stuff , mentally and physically			0
" when i was leaving primary school i wanted to be a @entity18 racer , " the 23 - year - old told @entity4			1
" my teachers and my family would say , ' how are you going to make a career out of bmx racing ? it 's not even an @entity26 sport ! ' " gold medal formula : @entity28 ? that changed in 2003 , when the @entity30 announced that @entity18 would be a full medal event at the @entity32			1
@entity18 , inspired by motocross , started life in the late 1960s as kids playing on bikes in @entity37			2
it has since evolved into a sport which pits highly - trained athletes against each other over one white - knuckle lap of a dirt course			2
" it 's grown a massive amount , " said @entity10 , who has also won track cycling world titles alongside 2008 @entity26 gold medalist @entity44			1
" before the @entity26 in 2008 it was big , but then after ... people understood our sport a lot more			1
kids started coming along to the tracks , adults started coming along			0
people who raced back in the ' 80s , they started coming back into the sport			0
" @entity58 2012 : a swimmer 's story having qualified for the four - rider women 's final at @entity62 in 2008 after a series of grueling qualifying heats , @entity10 -- already a double world champion and the favorite to clinch the sport 's inaugural gold medal -- had the chance to justify the career choice she had so stubbornly made as a child			1
but it was not to be			0
" everything seemed to come to a complete standstill , " said @entity10 , who crashed out of the deciding race after clipping @entity76 's eventual champion @entity75			1
it was a sad conclusion to an uneasy @entity26 campaign in which she also crashed during the individual time trials and the first semifinal heat			1
but the final , unlike the semis , offered @entity10 no chance of redemption once her face had hit the dirt			1
she was left to contemplate giving up on her @entity26 dream after just one attempt			2
" how hurt i felt from that race , i was like , ' do i even want to do sport anymore ? do i want to be in sport if this is the way it makes me feel ? ' " but @entity10 's mental strength came to the fore and , over time , she regained her composure and confidence ahead of a home games in @entity58 later this year			1
" @entity102 is a great healer			0
i got up , brushed myself down and i thought , ' this is what i am good at and this is what i trained for			0
' " she will again enter the competition as a strong gold medal contender after clinching her third world title in @entity110 in 2010			1
the prospect of being backed by thousands of partisan fans at the @entity114 's bmx track , combined with her victory at last august 's @entity26 test event , has given @entity118 plenty of cause for optimism			2
" i 've never performed in front of 6,000 people before and i 've never competed in front of 6,000 @entity125 people who are all behind you , " she said			0
" i think the atmosphere is going to be electric there and really motivating at the same time			0
" if @entity10 once again comes up short in her pursuit of gold , then at least she has learned not to let sporting shortcomings drag her down			2
" my motto is life and in sport is ' happiness is the key to success			0
' you can be successful , but without happiness it means nothing			0
that 's definitely what i go by			0
