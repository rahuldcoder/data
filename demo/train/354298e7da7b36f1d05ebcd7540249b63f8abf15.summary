-- millions of migrant workers flood to the @entity2 from some of the world 's poorest countries in search of paid work they wo n't find at home			1
but for some , the journey does n't end as they hope			0
instead , they become victims of human trafficking , forced labor and sexual exploitation			1
the @entity17 : join @entity0 's fight to end modern day slavery a report released tuesday by the @entity21 paints a horrifying picture of migrant workers who find themselves trapped in appalling conditions without any way to get out			1
" our research team interviewed hundreds of workers and their experiences independent of country were very similar , actually , " @entity26 , the report 's author and head of the @entity21 's @entity29 , told @entity0			1
" they were lured into jobs that either did n't exist or that were offered under conditions that were very different from what they were promised in the first place , " she said			2
data is scarce , but the @entity21 estimates as many as 600,000 people may be victims of forced labor across the @entity2			1
that equates to 3.4 in every 1,000 of the region 's inhabitants being compelled to work against their free choice , the @entity21 said			1
the study , titled " tricked and trapped : human trafficking in the @entity2 , " is based on more than 650 interviews done over a two - year period in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53			1
more than half of those interviewed for the study were migrant workers , the @entity21 said			1
the others included employers , government officials and representatives of employers ' and workers ' groups in the @entity2			1
" @entity65 migration in this part of the world is unique in terms of its sheer scale and its exponential growth in recent years , " @entity26 said			0
" the challenge is how to put in place safeguards in both origin and destination countries to prevent the exploitation and abuse of these workers			2
" low - skilled migrant workers are the most vulnerable to human trafficking and forced labor , whether at the hands of unscrupulous agents or individual employers , the report states			1
" victims of trafficking usually have limited financial resources , incur debt and are poorly educated , " it says			2
" at the same time , many are resilient and courageous women and men , who are aware of the possible risks of exploitation but , impelled by the lack of viable job opportunities at home and the pressing needs of their families , have nevertheless made their individual decisions to travel abroad in search of work			0
" confined , beaten , raped domestic workers are particularly vulnerable because their isolation in private homes , without inspections , makes them more vulnerable to exploitation and forced labor , the @entity21 said			1
among the conditions they may face are : being denied proper time off ; being confined to their place of work ; being placed under surveillance ; being made to live in degrading conditions , like sleeping in a kitchen or hallway ; or having their identity papers confiscated or wages withheld so they ca n't leave			2
in more extreme cases , they may be subject to physical and sexual violence			0
a @entity123 domestic worker in @entity51 told the @entity21 she was caught after trying to escape by climbing out over the balcony			2
" my employer broke my elbow and then tied my hands behind my back			0
they left me one day long in my room and put a camera there			0
he threatened me : ' i 'll accuse you of stealing money and ask for my money back , and they will throw you in jail ! ' " she is quoted as saying			0
another @entity123 domestic worker interviewed in a detention center in @entity52 told the @entity21 that her employer had raped her			1
" i went to the doctors and filed a complaint at the police , and then returned to work the next day			0
he reported to the authorities that i had run away , and the police arrested me , " she said			0
" my employer tells me that if i drop the rape charges , he will make sure that i am not deported			0
" even where anti-trafficking laws exist , prosecutions are few , so " there is little to deter others from confining migrant workers in exploitative situations against their will , " the @entity21 points out			1
sex brokers meanwhile , those who are coerced into sex work within the entertainment industry face a " real " risk of violence , detention or deportation , the report said			0
" owners and managers of entertainment establishments , and sex brokers ( pimps ) , do not hesitate to use threats of denunciation to the authorities and family repudiation , and actual psychological , physical and sexual violence , to intimidate their victims , " the report says			2
" the impossibility of leaving the exploiter is entrenched by the fact that women known to have engaged in sex work have limited opportunities to secure income by other means			0
" @entity187 and @entity188 women are particularly vulnerable to being deceived and coerced into sexual exploitation , the report said			0
some are lured away from their original employers with promises of love or a better job , and then forced into sex work , while others are abducted on arrival and taken to underground brothels , or are tricked into thinking they have a job as a waitress or singer in a nightclub and then made to provide sexual services			2
in some cases , those running the sex rings are other migrant workers , often of the same nationality , the report said			1
local sponsors may also be involved or turn a blind eye			0
" even though prostitution is legally forbidden in most countries of the @entity2 , the commercial sex industry employing foreign women is unofficially tolerated , " the report said			1
in part , this is because demand for sexual services is stubbornly high			0
in addition to the local demand , there are also large numbers of male migrant workers who are away from home for long periods and can not fulfill their natural sex drive by legitimate means , the report says			1
a @entity230 client of sex workers is quoted as saying : " i think the majority of women are forced to have sex			2
they are physically beaten , isolated and locked in the apartments			0
the clients are usually aware that the women are forced but are okay with this because they themselves are sexually deprived			0
" some girls from @entity2 countries who are forced into marriage are also pushed into prostitution by their husbands , the report says			1
' forced into the desert ' but while much attention focuses on the plight of women , male migrant workers in the construction , manufacturing , seafaring and agriculture sectors are also vulnerable to human trafficking , the report says			1
they " are routinely deceived with respect to living and working conditions , the type of work to be performed , or even the existence of a job at all			0
" some migrant workers reported having been recruited as domestic workers -- but then forced to tend animal herds in the desert			1
a " runaway " @entity270 shepherd interviewed in @entity52 told the @entity21 : " i came to @entity52 to work as a driver and my employer took me across the border in @entity274 for six months			2
" i lived in a small steel hut with no air conditioning , no electricity and no shower or toilet			0
i was not allowed to kill the animals to feed myself			0
i was scared of my employer who tried to hit me but i said , ' if you hit me , i will hit you back			0
' " complex factors make it almost impossible for many to leave if it all goes wrong			0
chief among these is the " kafala , " or sponsorship , system that governs most migrant workers in the region			1
this , the @entity21 says , is " inherently problematic " because it creates an unequal power dynamic between the employer and the worker			2
many employers justify holding the passports of migrant workers because under the system they are legally responsible for the worker 's residency and employment			1
they may also hold back wages -- meaning workers ca n't leave because they risk ending up with nothing -- or charge sky - high " release " fees to stop exploited workers from seeking jobs elsewhere			1
" the system was not set up to create this extreme dependence between employers and workers , " @entity26 said			2
positive changes of course , not every migrant worker has a bad experience , and for many the opportunity to work overseas delivers the promised escape from grinding poverty at home			0
the presence of migrant workers is also vital to the economies of many countries in the @entity2 -- and in some , they outnumber the national workers substantially , the @entity21 points out			1
in @entity330 , an astonishing 94 % of workers are migrants , while in @entity274 that figure is over 50 % , the report says			2
migrants also make up a significant part of the workforce in @entity50 and @entity51			0
the @entity21 report highlights some positive changes in the region , saying governments and other groups have stepped up efforts to combat forced labor and human trafficking in recent years , including through the passage of anti-trafficking legislation			1
but , it says , " shortcomings persist in applying laws and prosecuting and convicting perpetrators of human trafficking			0
" it proposes an overhaul of the kafala system , suggesting that national ministries of labor should be in charge of the recruitment process , rather than agencies , and should handle complaints			0
the @entity21 also recommends extending legislation to protect all types of worker , the revision of employment contracts , beefing up inspections and ending wage discrimination			2
opinion : 5 signs the @entity2 is changing @entity369 @entity368 and @entity370 contributed to this report .			1

new : migrant workers are often duped into taking jobs , the report 's author says
as many as 600,000 people may be victims of forced labor in the @entity2 , @entity21 says
migrant workers give accounts of being raped , abused or kept *prisoner* by employers
employers or agents sometimes withhold wages or documents to prevent workers leaving
