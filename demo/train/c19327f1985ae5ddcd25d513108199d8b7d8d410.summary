editor 's note : @entity2 is on @entity3 nightly at 7 and 9 et and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show			1
@entity2 says conservation wo n't solve energy crisis , and we need more oil drilling in the @entity9 @entity10 ( @entity3 ) -- call our politicians and tell them to stay on vacation			1
call the caribou roaming in @entity14 and tell them they 're safe			2
call the @entity17 king and tell him what you really think of his oil			2
@entity21 , @entity2 , a recovering alcoholic rodeo clown , have come up with a solution to @entity9 's energy crisis ... and you 're wearing it			1
look at yourself right now			0
you 've probably got on a shirt , socks , shoes , jewelry , maybe even some pants			0
do you have any idea how much all of that weighs ? if people really loved @entity9 , they would strip down , leave their clothes at home , and drive around buck naked			2
that would decrease the weight of our cars , which would increase our gas mileage so dramatically that we probably would n't have to drill for any new oil ! genius , right ? of course , my idea has about as much of a chance to make a real difference in our energy crisis as the suggestion that @entity52 recently made			1
" making sure your tires are properly inflated , simple thing , " @entity52 said			1
" but we could save all the oil that they 're talking about getting off drilling , if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune - ups			1
you could actually save just as much			0
" when the @entity65 asked @entity52 's campaign for the figures they used to make that claim , they could n't produce any -- but plenty of other people have			1
it turns out that about two - thirds of vehicles already have properly inflated tires			0
that means we 'd likely save somewhere around 800,000 barrels of oil a day if everyone else also complied			2
meanwhile , the @entity9 @entity80 estimates that there are about 86 billion barrels of oil in the areas that we 're not allowed to drill			2
you do the math. but , facts aside , @entity52 seemed to be stunned that @entity88 would dare ridicule an idea as revolutionary as checking your tire pressure			1
" they 're making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption , " he complained			2
no , what they 're making fun of is that a guy who , less than two months earlier , was against the gas tax holiday because it was a " gimmick , " has suddenly embraced what is essentially a gimmick			1
no one , including @entity107 , disputes that keeping your tires inflated will help you get better gas mileage			1
but so will emptying your trunk , buying a hybrid , not using the heat , and driving naked			1
the point is that none of those things are solutions ; they 're unsustainable gimmicks that distract people from solving the underlying crisis			2
they 're also exactly the type of things that @entity52 once claimed he was against			1
but , of course , the adoring mainstream media does n't want to talk about that , they just want to defend @entity52 's honor			1
@entity129 recently wrote an article titled , " the tire - gauge solution : no joke , " that probably would 've been harsher on @entity52 if it was written by @entity52 himself			1
it 's more love - sonnet than journalism			0
" meanwhile , " he wrote , " efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent			1
many drivers already follow their advice , but if everyone did , we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points			0
in other words : @entity52 is right			2
" of course he 's right ; he 's @entity52 , savior of the universe ! but one phrase that he used deserves a little more attention : " but if everyone did			1
" " but if everyone " donated their organs then people would n't die waiting for them			0
" but if everyone " ate only lettuce then our health care system would be fixed			0
" but if everyone " just sent me one dollar then i 'd retire with $ 300 million in the bank			0
of course , the reality is that people still die waiting for organs , obesity is an epidemic , and i 'm still writing these columns			0
that 's why saying " but if everyone did " is such a red herring			0
@entity129 went on to suggest that perhaps we 're just over-thinking this whole " energy crisis " thing			2
" it 's a pretty simple concept , " he wrote			0
" if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on @entity177 dictators while destroying the planet , maybe we ought to use less			2
" welcome back to @entity179			0
saying " we ought to " is exactly the same as " but if everyone " -- a way to make a ridiculous point sound plausible			0
it 's like saying : we ought to all live in peace and harmony			0
it 's not that easy			0
but let 's follow his yellow brick road for a second anyway			0
if we all put on our @entity193 sweaters and used less oil , we 'd still need millions of barrels			0
how about making sure those barrels come from @entity9 by starting to drill for it now ? we 'll never be truly free until we 're completely free from @entity177 oil			1
not surprisingly , drilling was nowhere to be found in the article , but @entity129 did include plenty of other , " simple " things we can do : " we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs			0
we can unplug our televisions , computers and phone chargers when we 're not using them			0
" he 's living in a dream world ! not only is unplugging a television not going to do a darn thing , it 's annoying and almost no one in their right mind will ever , ever , ever , ever do it ! ever ! and finally , just in case you were n't yet sure if @entity129 's article was essentially a commercial for @entity52 , here 's how he ended it : " it 's sad to see ( @entity107 's ) campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge , promoting the fallacy that @entity9 are powerless to address their own energy problems			1
because the truth is : yes , we can ... " hmm , let me think , where have i heard " yes we can " before ? ohhh , that 's right , it 's what @entity52 supporters chant at his speeches			1
is @entity52 's energy policy solely based on tire gauges ? no. but can we criticize him for embracing the same kind of gimmicky stall tactics that have gotten us to this place ? yes			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : americans could dramatically improve gas mileage by driving naked
@entity52 's tire inflation advice is a gimmick rather than part of a plan , he says
we ca n't conserve our way out of our energy problems , @entity2 says
@entity2 : we wo n't be truly free until we 're free from @entity177 oil
