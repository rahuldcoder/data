@entity0 -- arranging to have pizzas delivered to a stranger 's door is a classic prank			1
on the @entity7 , it 's charity			2
@entity8 found that out recently when she posted an offer on the link - sharing website called @entity12			1
the @entity14 , @entity15 , native was feeling especially charitable one day and asked the site 's audience of 18.8 million visitors how she could donate to people in need			2
" someone had commented saying , ' hey , you should take this over to @entity25 , ' " @entity8 said			1
surfing to that section , she found people posting their pleas for free pizza			2
members are encouraged to place orders for requests they feel especially moved by			2
one person said on thursday that he went out of town and left his wallet at home , and another said he lost his credit card and is sick of eating tortillas			0
but the true spirit of @entity25 , the creators and some members say , involves donating to people who could n't otherwise feed themselves -- and yet are web savvy enough to panhandle online			1
" it 's about helping someone out while they 're down at the moment , " @entity8 said			0
she has sent 10 pizzas so far that were delivered to hungry strangers			1
@entity8 has been active in other charity work , including online - donation programs , but @entity25 provides " instant gratification , " she said			1
pizza recipients generally give thanks and sometimes snap a picture of the empty pizza box after the order is placed , in 30 minutes or less			2
the section 's popularity has tipped			0
it received 226,000 visitors in a recent week			0
other charitable efforts on @entity12 have taken off			1
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 all encourage giving to the poor			2
still , the 10 - person team that develops @entity12 , which itself has grown significantly in the last few months , were surprised to see the program take off			1
earlier this month , they pooled their cash and spent $ 120 on pizzas for the @entity71 in @entity0			2
" we never would have said , ' oh , @entity12 would be a great platform to give pizza to strangers , ' " said @entity72 , @entity12 's new general manager			1
donors receive the person 's home address through a private message and can quickly place an order using the many websites designed for food delivery			0
" a big factor is just how easy it is , " said @entity83 , a lawyer from @entity84 who started the section			0
@entity83 , along with @entity88 , a former computer technician in @entity89 , are attempting to get @entity25 on the radar of a major national pizza chain			1
@entity92 and @entity93 have expressed vague interest , @entity88 said			0
separately , @entity12 , which is owned by publisher @entity95 , has reached out to the big restaurants			1
" we 've heard of the program , but have had no direct contact with @entity12 , " @entity92 's spokesman @entity98 wrote in an e-mail			1
@entity25 sent a request to @entity103 , which powers the system that many retailers use for ordering gift cards and which many @entity109 donors use to gift meals , asking the site to accept credit cards from outside the @entity113 , @entity88 said			1
but the process is slow - moving			0
@entity103 ceo @entity115 said through a spokeswoman that he had never heard of the group			0
the co-creators of the pizza - giving program have wives and children , and they each lost their jobs during the worst of the economic downturns			0
since connecting online ( they 've never met ) and improving their fiscal situations , @entity83 and @entity88 decided to organize a charitable group online			0
but why cheese , sauce and dough ? " it was the one food during that time period ( of hardships ) that i did n't have a lot of , that i love , " @entity83 said			0
" it was n't just about pizza			0
it 's about just getting that kind of comfort food and that kind of hope			0

a link - sharing website called @entity12 is host to several *grassroots* charity efforts
one that has become popular recently is called @entity25
there , members order pizzas to be delivered to poor people
