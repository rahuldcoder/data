@entity0 's @entity21 , with a penalty that struck the upright , and @entity24 missed kicking chances for their respective sides to leave it 7 - 3 at halftime			2
hook , once again struggling with the boot , should have slotted over a three - point attempt early in the second half but it was quickly forgotten as veteran wing @entity33 , playing in the final @entity5 match of his career , produced a moment of magic in the 49th minute			1
he controlled a loose ball before gathering to go over in the corner and put @entity42 's men in front for the first time in the playoff			0
@entity46 to end 24 years of hurt ? but @entity18 missed the conversion and the @entity0 responded with two penalties from 21 - year - old @entity21 to take a 13 - 8 lead after 65 minutes			1
@entity9 , 25 , extended @entity0 's advantage with a drop goal , before flanker @entity53 touched down for the decisive try with 76 minutes on the clock			2
@entity2 , who have enjoyed their most successful @entity5 campaign since the tournament was last held in @entity46 24 years ago , finished with a flourish , wing halfpenny grabbing a try on the 80 - minute mark			1
@entity63 said there were plenty of positives his team could take from their performance in the tournament , but lamented the poor kicking which ultimately cost @entity2 the bronze medal			1

" but there are a lot of positives to take out of this tournament			0
we 've brought a lot of young players through			0
" we 've just got to keep looking to improve			0
we only lost 21 - 18 to one of the best sides in the world			1
so there are a lot of positives in that			0
we missed one or two easy ones and @entity21 has kicked pretty well			0
that 's probably been the difference			0
" it is the first time @entity0 have finished third at the four - yearly tournament , having been crowned champions in 1991 and 1999 , runners - up in 2003 and fourth in 1987			2
