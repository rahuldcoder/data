@entity0 -- the @entity2 and @entity3 have agreed that about half the @entity2 @entity4 on the @entity3 island of @entity6 will soon leave , a transition that could ease a long - simmering resentment of the @entity2 ' presence that has at times boiled over			1
the news from a joint @entity2 - @entity3 committee comes as @entity3 prime minister @entity13 prepares to meet monday with president @entity14 in @entity0			1
" i am very pleased that , after many years , we have reached this important agreement and plan of action , " secretary of defense @entity15 said , noting the lengthy seesaw talks aimed at cutting the @entity2 presence on the island south of @entity19			2
about 9,000 @entity4 and their family members will leave @entity6 , the @entity2 - @entity24 said thursday			1
about 5,000 will go to @entity26 as part of a much larger @entity2 military build up in @entity29 , a realignment that comes amid @entity32 's rapid growth as a major economic and military power			0
the @entity2 military presence on @entity6 has caused considerable controversy			2
some have complained about noise from the base , in an urban area			0
many others were incensed by the misconduct of @entity2 troops stationed there , including the 1995 rape of 12 - year - old @entity3 girl by three @entity2 military personnel			1
opposition to the presence of @entity2 troops in @entity6 runs so deep that it contributed to the resignation of former prime minister @entity50 in 2010			2
he had promised to move the base but later announced that the base would stay , a decision he called " heartbreaking			0
" his critics said then that he gave in to @entity2 pressure , and his government coalition broke up			0
" recognizing the strong desires of @entity6 residents , these relocations are to be completed as soon as possible while ensuring operational capability throughout the process , " the @entity2 - @entity24 @entity3 's foreign minister , @entity63 , called the agreement satisfactory			1
@entity2 military personnel by country " it 's forward - looking and meaningful , one that can act upon the changing security environment as well as reducing the burden on @entity6 , " @entity63 said friday morning			1
of the @entity4 being transferred , about 2,700 will be sent to @entity72 and still others will rotate through a base in @entity75 , @entity76			0
the relocations are in line with president @entity14 's goal to have the military have a geographically distributed presence in the @entity82			0
the transfer leaves between 9,000 and 10,000 @entity4 belonging to the @entity84 on @entity6			2
" so , in the end , we are sustaining the same presence in the @entity82 that we 've intended for some time , " said a senior @entity2 defense official , who spoke on condition of anonymity as a matter of routine during a briefing with reporters			1
@entity6 was the site of the last major campaign for @entity2 forces in the @entity82 during @entity98 lasted from march through june 1945			2
more than 100,000 civilians , 100,000 @entity3 troops and 12,000 @entity2 were believed to have died in the fighting for the island chain , roughly 1,000 miles south of @entity19			2
after the @entity2 defeated @entity3 in @entity104 , a @entity2 occupation force remained in @entity6 and other parts of the country			1
@entity3 regained control of the islands in 1972			0
during the @entity110 , the @entity2 military presence on @entity6 served as a bulwark against communism in a strategic location during the @entity114			0
more recently , the @entity2 has kept its forces in @entity6 and increased its military footprint across @entity29 as @entity32 rises as a major economic and military power			0
much of the @entity2 assistance to @entity3 after last year 's earthquake was launched from @entity6 bases			1
the friction between locals and military personnel has been exacerbated in recent years by cultural misunderstandings and the isolated criminal acts			0
it 's hoped the reduction of forces on the island chain will reduce the animosity			0
the call for the @entity2 military to leave @entity6 escalated after the 1995 rape of the 12 - year - old , a crime that outraged the @entity3 and led to calls by many that @entity2 troops leave			1
in 1996 , spurred in part by @entity3 anger on @entity6 , @entity0 and @entity19 signed an agreement to reduce the amount of land being occupied by @entity2 forces			1
about 40,000 @entity2 personnel are based in @entity3 , and more than three - quarters of the military bases are on @entity6			1
at its height , @entity2 military operations on @entity6 accounted for about 20 percent of the land use on the island chain			0
in 2006 , the @entity2 and @entity3 reached an agreement that would have relocated thousands of @entity4 off the island once the @entity154 at @entity155 was closed and moved to @entity156 on @entity6			1
that plan stalled after widespread protests over the proposed location and costs for the new air base			0
@entity155 is not addressed under the agreement announced thursday to move the @entity4			0
" i think what we 've done with the agreement is ... to create the political space for the government of @entity3 to move this forward on its own timeline , " the defense official said			1
as part of the agreement , the @entity2 will begin returning lands on @entity6 in phases as the @entity4 depart			1
part of the $ 8.6 billion cost to relocate the @entity4 from @entity6 to @entity26 will be picked up by @entity3 , which has agreed to pay $ 3.1 billion , the @entity174 statement said			2
@entity177 reported from @entity0 , @entity178 from @entity179			0
@entity1 's @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

about 9,000 @entity4 will be moved off @entity6 , a @entity2 - @entity3 committee says
@entity3 's foreign minister calls the agreement " satisfactory "
