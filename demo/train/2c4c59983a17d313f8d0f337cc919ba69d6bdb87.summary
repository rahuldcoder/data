president @entity0 did n't know the @entity1 was collecting communications of allied leaders such as @entity5 chancellor @entity4 , the chairman of the @entity6 said on monday			1
moreover , sen. @entity7 of @entity8 said in a statement that her panel was unaware of the sweeping intelligence effort and said that the @entity12 had told her that such data collection " will not continue			1
" @entity7 's overall comments confirmed recent news reports on the @entity17 electronic surveillance network revealed in classified leaks by former agency agency contractor @entity19			1
separately , director of national intelligence @entity21 said late monday that he was authorizing the release of more details about the government 's collection of telephone records under the @entity28 , in an effort to show the extent the spying program was overseen by a secret federal court and @entity33			2
@entity21 testifies on tuesday before the @entity34 about the program			0
the documents date mostly to 2009 , when the administration was pushing lawmakers to reauthorize sections of the @entity40 that were set to expire			2
house committee to question spy chiefs about phone tapping allegations one document from 2011 notifies the @entity12 and @entity6 intelligence and judiciary committees of the @entity17 's testing in 2010 - 2011 of a program to collect cell phone tower data that could track mobile phone users			1
the @entity17 acknowledged this month that it tested such collection but discontinued it			0
the document says the @entity54 prepared a memorandum authorizing the program , which the document said fell legally within guidelines of another existing program under @entity60 of the @entity40			0
most of the newly - declassified documents describe the aggressive push by the @entity17 , the @entity64 and the @entity54 for lawmakers to save the bulk telephone - data collection effort , known as the 215 program , because it was important for their efforts to thwart terrorist threats			0
lawmakers were urged not to discuss the classified program for fear it would hurt national security , the documents show			0
with the latest revelations from @entity19 threatening to roil diplomatic relations in @entity80 , @entity81 and elsewhere , the @entity0 administration maintained its firm and consistent response to all seeking answers -- we 're not admitting anything , but we 'll change it for the better			1
" i 'm not here to talk about classified information			0
what i am confirming is the fact that we 're undergoing a complete review of how our intelligence operates outside of the country , " the president told @entity90			1
" we give them policy direction , but what we 've seen over the last several years is their capacities continue to develop and expand , and that 's why i 'm initiating now a review to make sure that what they 're able to do does n't necessarily mean what they should be doing , " he said			2
the latest protest @entity108 became the latest to protest , summoning @entity1 @entity109 for a @entity111 meeting monday to discuss an @entity113 newspaper report that quoted unnamed sources as saying the @entity17 spied on @entity108 officials and politicians			2
much of the focus is on expanded surveillance under the @entity40 passed in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			2
@entity19 's leaks in june have led to continued reports of collecting millions of phone and @entity125 records from around the world , as well as the reports of monitoring communications of governments and even leaders in @entity5 , @entity131 and other countries			2
@entity0 did not learn until recently of the @entity17 surveillance of other world leaders , including allies , a senior administration official told @entity137 on monday			1
however , other officials said the president or at least his @entity12 staff did know about it			1
@entity17 spying claims : five things you need to know @entity12 spokesman @entity145 refused to discuss particular reported operations on monday , but went on at some length on changes ordered by @entity0 in response to the @entity19 leaks , including a review of surveillance programs to be completed in december			1
" there are a number of efforts under way that are designed to increase transparency , to work with @entity33 to look at reforms to the @entity40 , to look at ways that we can increase oversight and increase constraints on the authorities provided by these programs , " @entity145 told reporters			0
without confirming any of the news reports about alleged @entity1 spying on foreign leaders , @entity145 also said that also was being addressed			2
" there 's a review under way that will look at , among other issues , some of the very specific things with regards to intelligence - gathering , including matters that deal with heads of state and other governments , " he said			1
the @entity179 reported on sunday that the president was unaware of the full scope of the surveillance programs involving heads of state			2
a senior administration official confirmed some of the details in the newspaper 's report			2
in particular , the official said the @entity12 did n't learn of all of the surveillance programs until its internal review over the summer , after which some of them were stopped			1
the targeting of @entity4 's phone did not end until more recently , the official said			2
saying @entity7 's statement was not completely accurate , a senior administration official said some changes have been made but they are not across - the - board changes in policy like terminating intelligence collection aimed at allies			1
another @entity1 official said @entity0 , like every president , received detailed documents on the framework of the programs as part of his briefing when he took office in 2009			1
one of the programs targeted leaders in specific countries , which would have been a focus of the briefing , according to the official			0
another senior administration official argued the president approves a set of intelligence priorities , and then it 's the responsibility of his administration to determine how to carry those out , making it unreasonable to expect @entity0 to know every detail of exactly how that happened			1
" i really doubt he had to sign off on something like that or get into the details , " said a former senior administration official who worked on national security for the @entity0 @entity12			1
to @entity7 , the fact that neither @entity0 nor her committee knew about the program was a " big problem			1
" " as far as i 'm concerned , @entity33 needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing , " her statement said			2
" to that end , the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs			1
" @entity12 : reviewing surveillance of allies @entity4 said last week that reports of @entity1 spying on her and other leaders had " severely shaken " relationships between the @entity1 and @entity80 nations			1
the @entity5 leader said she told @entity0 last week that eavesdropping among friends " is never acceptable			1
" @entity145 repeated monday the @entity12 line that @entity4 was not being monitored now and would not be in the future -- without saying whether she had been targeted in the past			2
also monday , sen. @entity256 , a member of the @entity6 , said she knew of " no justification for the @entity259 's collection of intelligence on the leaders of our closest allies , " such as @entity4			2
" i will be seeing the @entity5 ambassador tomorrow night and will express directly to him my belief that it was wrong for the @entity259 to engage in monitoring of the chancellor 's telephone calls , " she said in a statement			0
should the president know wiretap details ? separately , the @entity17 on sunday denied a report by the @entity5 newspaper @entity273 that @entity17 director @entity274 told @entity0 about the surveillance of @entity4 in 2010			1
" gen. @entity274 did not discuss with president @entity0 in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving @entity5 chancellor @entity4 , nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving chancellor @entity4 , " @entity17 spokeswoman @entity276 told @entity137			1
@entity5 intelligence officials are scheduled to meet with their @entity1 counterparts in @entity284 this week to ask about surveillance programs			1
other news media reports , based on documents leaked by @entity19 , have said the @entity17 monitored the communications of the leaders of @entity131 and @entity290			0
@entity5 and @entity131 are drafting a @entity294 resolution on privacy in electronic communication , officials in those countries said last week			0
report : @entity17 monitored 60 million @entity108 calls in 30 days the @entity108 newspaper @entity299 reported monday that the @entity17 collected data from 60 million phone calls in @entity108 in one 30 - day period			0
one of the authors of the @entity299 article was @entity305 , the journalist who first reported on documents supplied by @entity19 for the @entity308 newspaper @entity307			0
the @entity299 article cited what it said was an @entity17 report titled , " @entity108 -- last 30 days			0
" the 60 million calls were not recorded , but the @entity17 collected serial numbers of devices , phone numbers , locations and durations of calls , the newspaper said			0
in an interview monday with @entity137 , @entity305 denied assertions by @entity1 officials that the surveillance program was purely for security reasons			0
" none of this has to do with terrorism , " he said			0
" is @entity4 a terrorist ? are 60 or 70 million @entity108 or @entity329 citizens terrorists ? this is clearly about political power and economic espionage and the claim that this is all about terrorism is seen for what it is all around the world , which is pure deceit			0
" @entity145 denied any economic motivation , telling reporters that " we do not use our intelligence capabilities for that purpose			0
" " it 's very important to recall , too , that we have extraordinarily strong and important intelligence and security relationships with our allies , " he said , adding that the @entity12 review of surveillance issues would " look at how we can better balance our security needs , and the security needs of our allies , against the real privacy concerns that we all share			1
" in @entity108 , a @entity356 statement said monday that in the meeting with @entity109 , the government " conveyed to the @entity1 the importance of preserving a climate of confidence " in bilateral relations , adding that " some practices , which if they are true , are inappropriate and unacceptable between partners and friendly nations			0
" a statement by @entity109 repeated the administration 's past statements that the surveillance policies are under review			1
it said the policies have " played a critical role in protecting citizens of the @entity1 " and played " an instrumental role in our coordination with our allies and in protecting their interests as well			0
" " we will continue to confer with our allies , such as @entity108 , through our regular diplomatic channels to address the concerns that they have raised , " the @entity380 statement said			0
" ultimately , the @entity1 needs to balance the important role that these programs play in protecting our national security and protecting the security of our allies with legitimate privacy concerns			0
" the @entity329 daily newspaper @entity391 reported last week on claims that the @entity17 intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in @entity329 in 30 days			0
that report did not specify whether the calls were recorded or whether the interceptions were limited to data about calls .			0

review under way of how intelligence operates outside of the country , @entity0 says
@entity7 says @entity284 stops surveillance of allies , administration says not totally accurate
sources *differ* on when the @entity12 learned of foreign leader phone taps
@entity12 learned of foreign leader phone taps only this summer
