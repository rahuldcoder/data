@entity0 , @entity1 -- rowing across the @entity3 may hardly seem comparable to achieving success in the humdrum daily grind of an office desk job			1
for @entity13 adventure explorer @entity11 however , the gratification of completing a task of great importance to the self , is the same no matter the context or environment			1
" it 's so satisfying if you accomplish something that 's a challenge to you , " said the 26 - year - old who last week set off on her quest to become the first woman to row the @entity3 solo			1
" whether you 're in the water , or in an office , that 's universal , " she adds			0
@entity27 is undertaking the 4,500 nautical mile challenge from the east coast of @entity30 to the west coast of @entity32 , as part of a larger voyage that will see her circumnavigate the globe without the aid of any mechanical engines			1
she started in @entity0 in april 2011 and has so far made it 11,000 miles to @entity30 , biking and kayaking through @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 along the way			0

a further solo ocean crossing -- this time the @entity55 -- will follow before she paddles back to her port of origin in the @entity13 capital			1
" i love the challenge , " says @entity11 of the gargantuan adventure that will take her fully two and a half years to complete			1
" i rowed across the @entity62 in 2009 and it was then that i thought up this journey ( the @entity0 to @entity0 trip )			2
i just wanted more time at sea and i wanted to experience that same human - powered pace across landscape , " she adds			0
so far , @entity27 highlights some of the characters she has met along the way as inspiration in her darkest and most challenging moments			1
one man she met in a petrol station in eastern @entity44 was so inspired by her story that he bought a bike and joined her on the spot , accompanying her 4,000 kilometers ( 2,500 miles ) across the country to @entity80 and becoming a friend for life in the process			0
" it was a special experience for both of us , " @entity11 says of meeting her @entity44 traveling companion , @entity85 , " but really it was just wonderful to hear people 's stories on the road and to learn a little bit about their lives and dreams			2
" see also : naked rowers break @entity55 record as she prepares for her latest adventure , @entity27 is well aware that this leg of the challenge is one that she will have no choice but to face on her own			1
a custom - made seven meter long row boat -- aptly named @entity105 -- will help her breach the vast ocean expanse between @entity107 , @entity30 , and her next port of call @entity109 , @entity32			2
only a small solar cell on the vessel 's exterior will provide power for a satellite radio and a camera that will keep @entity27 in touch with the outside world			2
" there 's no engines , no motors , no nothing on here			0
i 'm the engine , " she says excitedly of what will be her floating home for at least the next six months			2
her friends and family have scrawled messages of support on the vessel 's interior which will , no doubt , offer comfort during what is sure to be an emotionally and psychologically grueling journey			0
@entity11 has prepared methodically for these challenges , but she says the most difficult aspect has been getting ready for the physical demands of the trip			2
she has trained hard to build up her core strength and stamina as well as bracing herself for potential hazards along the way such as boat capsizes , shark attacks and extreme weather events like hurricanes			0

" i love that feeling of not quite knowing if you 're going to make it through a certain scenario , " she says			0
" if the worst happens , at least i died trying			0
i think the worst thing in life is to end it with regrets or not having tried something , " she adds			0
if all goes to plan , @entity27 aims to complete her @entity3 crossing in a little over six months			1
she will then take a break for around six weeks before setting out across @entity52 and onwards towards the finishing line on the banks of the @entity171 in @entity0			0
for now however , talk of returning to the @entity13 and the completion of the full 20,000 mile odyssey seems a long way off			1
" its a year and a half more until i finish this journey at least so really there 's still quite a way to go yet , " she says .			0
