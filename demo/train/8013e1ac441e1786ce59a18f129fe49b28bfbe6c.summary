-- there are moments when " @entity3 , " the first new album by the @entity5 in 24 years , sounds so much like a record by the cars that you find yourself laughing out loud			1
take " @entity9 , " on which the opening salvo -- a terse guitar strum set against the machinelike thwack of snare drum and hand claps -- is such a note - perfect evocation of the band 's vintage attack that it almost plays like winking self - parody			2
@entity19 was mired in the @entity20 when @entity21 and @entity22 released their last studio album ; @entity24 , the @entity5 ' bassist and co-lead singer , died of pancreatic cancer in 2000			1
but the @entity5 have n't moved their music an inch			1
this is the sound of a band picking up a conversation in midsentence			1
@entity0 : watch the @entity5 return with surreal ' @entity9 ' can you blame them ? their hits are still radio mainstays , and their influence is audible in successive generations of pop - savvy rockers , from @entity42 to the @entity43			1
listen back to " @entity45 " or " drive " and you 'll hear where many of today 's young bands learned their tricks : how to mix guitars and synthesizers , how to make rock that 's as tuneful as bubblegum , and pop that 's as stylishly sinister as rock			0
" @entity3 " is a reminder that @entity56 can still sound new , especially when the cars do it			1
produced with skillful restraint by @entity21 , his bandmates and the dependable @entity61 ( the @entity62 , @entity63 ) , the album calls to mind adjectives long associated with the @entity5 : taut , sleek , seamless , efficient			1
it 's a record that whizzes past -- 10 songs in less than 40 minutes -- leaving behind a dark gleam			0
@entity0 : @entity56 heroes the cars roar back on reunion record it opens with a socko one - two punch : " @entity74 " and " too late , " textbook cars songs that place @entity21 's deadpan atop @entity78 's tensile lead guitar and @entity80 ' blipping , squealing keyboards			1
the cars have been called post-punk pop classicists -- what @entity85 might have sounded like had he lived long enough to trade in his strat for a @entity89 synthesizer			2
but the thing that has really set them apart is groove , and @entity21 is at his best in songs like " keep on @entity94 ' , " singing a jittery version of the boogie blues			0
@entity21 's lyrics can be hard to parse , whether about sex ( " your waxy face is melting on your lap / i sat there trying to crush a gingersnap " ) or politics ( " sanctuary in the heartland / black - and - white tv / stroking all the gunheads / to the ninth degree " )			0
but for @entity21 , the sound is more important than the message -- in fact , the sound is the message			2
the cars have always been mood - music specialists ; their cold , brittle , shiny songs evoke long nights , jagged nerves , frustrated longings			0
@entity0 gallery : random notes , rock 's hottest photos @entity24 added some warmth , a touch of daylight , to the proceedings , but with him gone , @entity21 has burnished the group 's music to a glossier shade of noir			0
" your eyes are dim , your heart is blue / ' cause nothing ever lasts , " @entity21 croaks over chiming guitar arpeggios in " @entity137 " ; on " @entity9 , " he sings , " it 's just a sad song that pulls you along			0
" long after we thought we 'd heard the last from them , the cars have made their darkest , most romantic album			2
