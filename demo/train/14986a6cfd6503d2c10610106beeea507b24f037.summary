-- having played the same hole 10 times in one day , you 'd think @entity4 would be sick of the sight of the 18th at @entity7 's @entity6			1
but the @entity9 golfer was more relieved to have ended a two - year wait for a @entity12 title , especially with a new member of the family on the way			2
" that is very tiring but i am really , really happy , " he said after winning a nine - hole playoff at the @entity17 on sunday , the equal longest decider in the tour 's 41 - year history			1
the 38 - year - old clinched his fourth @entity12 win , and first since triumphing at the 2011 @entity24 , having been tied with @entity26 's @entity25 and @entity28 's @entity27 after the 72 regulation holes			1
@entity25 , also 38 , bowed out at the third extra hole , and the other two matched each other par for par in the next five			2
@entity33 finally broke the deadlock with a wedge to five feet , sinking the birdie putt to deny 22 - year - old @entity27 his maiden top - level victory and claim the â ‚ ¬ 250,000 ( $ 327,000 ) first prize			1
it should lift the 146th - ranked player inside the top 100			0
" i could not make any putts ( in the play - off ) but the last one dropped , which means a lot for me and my family , " @entity33 said on the @entity12 website after taking his career earnings past â ‚ ¬ 9 million ( $ 11.8 million )			0
" there 's another baby coming at the end of november ; every time i get a baby , there 's a win so i 'll have a football team after a few years ! " @entity60 's @entity59 had led for most of the final day , but four bogeys in his last five holes meant he finished in a tie for fourth -- one shot away from making the playoff as he was left to rue a three - putt at 18			0
@entity67 tied for 12th at his national event , having flown from @entity69 after finishing eighth at the masters last sunday			0
@entity74 , playing his first tournament since breaking his leg in a skiing accident last year , missed the halfway cut along with former major champions @entity76 and @entity78 .			0

@entity4 wins @entity17 after *record* - equaling ninth playoff hole
@entity9 triumphs in three - way decider , which takes two hours to complete
he denies young @entity28 @entity27 his first top - level victory
@entity26 's @entity25 bows out after the third hole of the playoff
