-- thousands of clicks per minute			0
more than 23,000 reader comments , with the counter spinning like an odometer in a " @entity6 " movie			0
with 45 murders a day in the @entity8 and about one a minute worldwide , why have so many of us fastened on this one ? why do we care so much about the shooting death of someone for texting during a movie ? it 's clear from the headlines why the media are featuring the story : it 's not just a fatal shooting			1
it 's a fatal shooting over texting			1
as a crime story , it would be confined to the local @entity24 paper			1
as an @entity27 story , readers ca n't look away			1
we 're reading it because we think it tells us something about an issue we already care about			1
you can see this in the comments of people reading online articles about it			2
for some people , it 's proof that the texting has gone too far			1
for others it 's a lesson about gun control			0
others use it to decry the loss of civility			2
that 's how we take the story			2
but what does it actually tell us ? that some people habitually text too much ? we already knew that , but it 's not clear at all that the victim , @entity57 , was one of those people			2
maybe his 3 - year - old had a question or just needed to hear from her dad			0
that some people are thoughtless about how what they 're doing affects the people around them ? we already knew that , although it could be that @entity57 thought his texting was unobtrusive or was urgent enough to override the concerns of those he was disturbing			1
that the norms for internet use are not yet fully agreed upon by everyone ? we already knew that , although maybe the gunman was provoked not by the rudeness of @entity27 users but by what he perceived as the general rudeness of those who unwrap crinkly candies , talk back to the screen and whisper about what 's about to happen			0
the truth is , i fear , that although we receive news of this horrible incident as evidence of something , there 's really nothing to learn from it -- or from other individual events that are supposed to prove a point -- for two reasons			2
first , lots of people are rude in theaters without getting shot			2
so , we 'd need to know what made this case different			0
was the texter unusually persistent or obnoxious ? was he in a bad mood because his 3 - year - old needed something from him , because he thought previews count as advertisements and thus can be disrupted ? and why would this provoke someone to shoot him ? was the shooter mentally unstable ? on bad meds ? convinced that this would send a message to texters everywhere ? to understand this story , we would need to know the specifics -- why this texter got shot this time -- because humans do n't act for general reasons			1
but , as we understand the specifics , the scope of what we learn decreases			2
this becomes less an example of , say , the push - back against the internet than a story about particular people in a particular circumstance			1
the more specific the details , the less you can generalize from it			0
that holds not just for this story but for every time the media present a dramatic event in the life of individuals			1
choosing to take something as evidence of what we already believe is the opposite of evidence			0
" man shoots texter " is not evidence of a larger societal trend unless it is well - researched and part of a much larger , systematically gathered set of data			0
there would be no harm done , except stories like this actually get in the way of our learning something new			0
they encourage us to go " tsk , " and sadly shake our heads as if one of our beliefs has yet again been shown to be right , because that 's how we 've chosen to construe it			0
in short , we learn nothing from stories like these except which narratives the media think will get us to pay attention , and which narratives actually do			1
but this killing is not a lesson			0
it is just a tragedy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			1

@entity179 : media , readers *riveted* by story of shooting of texter in theater
he says we look only because it raises issues people care about : guns , civility , texting
as we learn particulars , story sheds ever less light on those broader issues , he says
*writer* : these stories feed our existing notions , there are no lessons . it is only tragic
