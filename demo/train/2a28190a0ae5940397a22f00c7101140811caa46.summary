-- a quick tweet or @entity3 post could put you behind bars in the @entity6 under a new cyber law , according to activists			1
the @entity9 came into effect wednesday despite widespread protests among netizens , journalists and free speech activists			1
" reaction has been overwhelming			0
this is quite unprecedented , " said @entity16 of @entity17 in @entity18			0
" i have n't seen this kind of uprising from the online community in the @entity6			1
this is a setback for one of the most social - media savvy countries			0
" the @entity6 had a steadily rising 28 million internet users in 2011 , approximately 30 % of the population , according to the @entity28 , placing it among the top 20 nations for internet use			1
before the law came into effect , the @entity6 was ranked the most " free " in @entity33 , according to the 2012 @entity35 report on internet freedom			1
the @entity6 ranked sixth globally , after the @entity37 , @entity38 and other @entity40 nations			1
the new law addresses an array of content and computer - related offenses , including cybersex , child pornography , unsolicited commercial communications and identity theft			2
the act also states that there will be " special cybercrime courts manned by specially trained judges to handle cybercrime cases			0
" critics of the law , who are calling it the " new martial law online , " are against a provision that criminalizes libel			1
" the law is so vague in many respects ; it is being interpreted in many ways -- comparing ' liking ' something on @entity3 to an investigative @entity65 © -- the law has to be clear , " @entity16 said			2
" it 's almost like an afterthought -- the libel portion was put there haphazardly			2
" existing libel laws of the @entity6 were dubbed " excessive " by the @entity72 in october 2011			1
local news organizations and civil rights groups mobilized to file a petition against the law , which they believe " establishes a regime of cyber authoritarianism			2
" the petition has sought a restraining order against enforcement of the new law			0
" you never know what 's going to trigger these libel offenses ... [ the law ] goes against overall freedom of press and expression			1
it is motivated by personal experiences -- they do n't like what you say and then you are penalized for it , " said @entity90 of the @entity91			0
other points of the new law have been contentious , such as the " take - down " provision , which enables the @entity99 to order removal of defamatory content without due process			0
the @entity6 government , in a statement , acknowledged the questions over the " constitutionality of certain provisions of the @entity9 " but also called on " critics of the @entity107 to speak out against online vandalism and bullying with as much vigor and passion as they expressed in their objections to certain provisions of the law			1
" the new law " is quite good ... except for the item on libel , " said @entity117 , a contributor to the @entity35 report			2
" at least the government is now dealing with cybercrime			0
" self - censorship will go up , internet users will have a sense of needing to police themselves , " she added			0
on the future of the cybercrime law , @entity117 said , " it will probably be modified because it is so unpopular			0
people are taking note of the legislators who voted for the law ; to pacify voters they will amend to mask the actual intention			0
