-- it 's mind - boggling to look at paintings from the 14th and 15th centuries and think that artists like @entity6 created such vibrant portraits using nothing more than a free hand and the naked eye -- when just 100 years before , two - point perspective was unknown			0
if you 're @entity13 , who 's been a seminal figure in modern painting since the 1960s , you literally ca n't believe it			1
@entity13 holds nothing against his predecessors , but he does have a theory that some used early optical devices to improve and expand their skills			1
the idea first occurred to him nearly 14 years ago and became the subject of his book @entity25 : rediscovering the lost techniques of the @entity27			0
@entity13 's latest show , a bigger exhibition , hosted by @entity31 's @entity30 , looks back on the period since his revelation , highlighting how he 's embraced technology ranging from video cameras to @entity36 , and integrated them into his art. ( the exhibition 's title is a play on @entity13 's best - known painting , a @entity43			1
) in 1999 , a long - standing and well known fascination with new media led @entity13 to his controversial suspicions			1
visiting the retrospective of a 19th century @entity49 artist , he noticed uncanny technical similarities to drawings that @entity52 had traced from slide - projected photographs			0
knowing that the tools @entity52 had used clearly were n't available in the 1800 's , @entity13 began researching			1
it was n't long before he came across camera lucida , a small prism mounted at the end of a metal arm that enables an artist to refract an image onto their paper			0
the device received a patent in 1807			0
the discovery was enough to prompt @entity13 to expand his investigation , which quickly grew in scope and size			2
by the end of his study he 'd created the @entity72 , a staggering arrangement of pictures organized chronologically from left to right , and geographically from top to bottom , charting of the evolution of western art across time and space			0
he used the @entity82 to trace this history of optical aids , identifying 1420 as the trend 's likely genesis			0
shown publicly for the first time at the @entity30 , the 8 - by - 72 - foot behemoth is the ultimate testament to @entity13 's obsession with technology 's influence on fine art. it 's obvious that tools like camera lucida made creating realistic artwork easier			1
but @entity13 's broader concern , which he 's explored extensively throughout his career , is how technology has allowed artists to experiment with new perspectives , and thus create new ways of considering the world around them			1
where @entity105 might have used convex mirrors to create a larger field of view on his canvas , @entity13 turns to a modern equivalent : video cameras			2
tucked among the rows of hanging paintings and sketches , four large sets of nine led screens roll footage of the same country road , each in one of the four seasons			0
to make the piece , titled @entity123 , @entity13 mounted nine cameras on an suv and while a studio assistant drove , he directed another who controlled each shot individually			2
the result is a video collage that 's synchronized in timing , but visually unaligned -- a choice he hoped would challenge the viewer 's understanding of perspective , encouraging them to explore each screen and become an active participant in the work			2
unsurprisingly , you can find more evidence of technological inspiration all over a bigger exhibition			1
walking through the seemingly endless space devoted to the exhibit -- the largest in the museum 's history -- it 's seemingly in more places than not			0
from towering 12 - foot - tall prints of @entity36 drawings to rolling flat screens depicting each of his digital brushstrokes , @entity13 's eye has remained steady while his tools have changed -- making you wonder what will be next in his arsenal			1
