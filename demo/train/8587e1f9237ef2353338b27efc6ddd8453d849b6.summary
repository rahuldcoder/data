of @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
five hundred million and rising also makes it clear to anyone not paying attention that @entity1 is no fad , that it is a cultural force shaping our collective culture			1
even if you have no desire to ever set up a profile , you ca n't ignore it and you are now oddly defined in the negative and left out of the zeitgeist			0
a service of that size wo n't disappear anytime soon , even if @entity1 has hit its plateau in the @entity29 but net users are fickle and the web 's short history includes dozens of sites that were once high - flying that have either since died ( @entity34 ) , lost their luster ( @entity13 ) or faded into irrelevance ( @entity37 )			1
so how could @entity1 lose its place at the center of the web ? 1			2
open , distributed alternatives a pack of college kids drunk on @entity44 launched an open - source , federated alternative to @entity1 called @entity47			1
after collecting an astonishing $ 120k in donations , the group is knocking out code			0
meanwhile , there 's other cool stuff going on , including @entity53 , the @entity54 and @entity55			0
get enough of these open protcols into decent shape and someone is likely to build them into an improbably powerful stack			0
research the @entity63 stack , if you do n't get my drift			0
what might that look like ? an elimination of the need for a centralized home and coordinator of social networking -- where your social profile lives wherever you want it to ( as your e-mail does ) and can interact with any other profile around the net , on your own terms			2
while it sounds far - fetched , a recent poll suggests that people are as happy with @entity1 as they are with their cable company , even if they do find it similarly indispensable			1
@entity11 there 's rumors the search giant is hatching its own social network system , despite the fact that it 's just not particularly good at social networking			1
its @entity92 social network has flailed and even seems to be losing its final two treasures , @entity95 and @entity96 , to @entity1			1
@entity11 's take on @entity98 , called @entity99 , is n't bad , but it 's not been much of a hit -- despite some fine features such as threaded coversations			2
and then it 's got @entity105 and @entity106 , and @entity106 and @entity108 and @entity11 pages and @entity109			2
i wonder if anyone has tried stacking any of those together over there in the @entity114 to create a place where people actually want to hang out -- the clear difference between a site like @entity1 and a site like @entity11 search			1
interesting things happen when people hang out			0
location - based services and the mobile device with the stunning popularity of pocket computers -- starting with the @entity128 , location - centric services such as @entity125 are gaining users at the rate that @entity1 used to			1
perhaps most importantly , they are figuring out ways to use the addictive mechanics of gaming to create services even more engrossing than @entity1			1
to compete , @entity1 has its own , very well - liked mobile app , and is set to expand how it interacts with the real world			1
but there 's a real threat here that @entity1 could get outflanked by clever kids not too much unlike themselves , who figure out how to create a more potent digital heroin			2
the @entity142 for those who love dark horses or the old and familiar , there 's always a chance that the world suddenly tires of their @entity1 wall or virtual farming and decide to get off the net 's grid entirely			2
socializing will still be necessary , of course , so we 'll see the return of sockhops , neighborhood restaurants and church socials			0
as for written messages , the @entity142 is actually quite good at delivering hand - written correspondence anywhere in the @entity163 for a nominal fee			0
the photo postcard will be huge again			0
but since the @entity142 is proposing to cease saturday delivery , its social networking service would be a weekday - only affair			2
vive la @entity170 ! 5			0
overreaching on the part of @entity172 @entity1 's founder and ceo @entity172 has changed the culture of the world with his single - minded devotedness to making people share more information with more people			1
in a world where software can determine culture , @entity172 's unwavering drive to make more and more of the details of our lives public by default has triumphed in nearly every instance over prevailing cultural norms -- with the glaring exception of the @entity193 project			0
but as with all visionaries , there is always the danger that in his attempt to lead his flock to the land of milk and honey , there will come a moment where he steps too far ahead , and the flock abandons the frontier for the pasture , leaving him alone and howling in the wilderness			0
