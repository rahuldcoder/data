-- for as long as i can remember , i have wanted to be able to say , " i 've run a @entity2			1
" unfortunately , i was so out of shape , it was hard to imagine walking 5 kilometers , let alone running them			0
when i found out the distance of the triathlon that i was going to be competing in with @entity8 come september -- a half - mile swim , an 18 - mile bike ride and a 4 - mile run -- i decided that somehow , i was going to run a @entity2 and then some ... and that was that			1
what i never imagined was that my first @entity2 would be held in my honor , organized by my friends and family as a surprise , right down @entity17 in my hometown of @entity19 , @entity20			1
the " top secret " planning all started right after my first @entity8 trip to @entity22 in january			0
my girlfriend , @entity24 , enlisted the help of my children , my co-workers and my family			1
she picked the date , named the race , rented the space and worked out all of the major details , all without my knowledge			1
the day that i was told about the plans for " @entity36 , " i had mixed emotions			0
i was shocked that so much had been planned without me finding out about it ; there were more than 50 people at this point that knew and they were my close friends and my family			1
i was overwhelmed because i do n't like to be the focus of attention , and this race was named after me so i had no choice			1
i was also scared that i would n't do well in the @entity2 itself -- there were going to be a lot of people watching if i failed			1
facing your fears head on in the beginning , the plan was to gather as many of my family , friends and community members as possible			1
the date of june 28 was picked because it was not only the day before my school 's graduation , it was also the last day of @entity64 / @entity63 ; everyone comes back to town that weekend			1
as race day got closer , the event got bigger and bigger			1
first , we found out that my former student - athlete , maj. @entity70 , was planning on attending			0
@entity70 was thrust into the public eye in april when he was wounded in the @entity73 shooting			0
when i received his message saying that he would be walking in my race ( he was still recovering from his third surgery ) , i was at the end of a long run			2
all of a sudden my exhausted legs felt lighter and stronger , and i finished with ease			0
the day before the big day , i was greeted by a local tv reporter from @entity82 , @entity20 , asking for an interview			1
as soon as the interview was finished , we got a call from @entity89 sen. @entity88 's office			2
@entity91 was not only going to be at the race , she was presenting me with a citation for making major changes to live a healthier lifestyle and inspiring not only my family and friends but my community to do the same			1
senator @entity91 at my race ? are you kidding ? ? we could n't have asked for a better day for the race			2
we got to the course at 6 a.m. to begin setting up			0
my family and friends started arriving about an hour later			1
that is when i started to realize just how big this was going to be			0
by 8 a.m. we had more than 200 people , there to either participate or just to show their support			0
when senator @entity91 made her presentation , by her side was @entity89 assemblyman @entity112			0
what i did n't know was that he had his running gear with him			0
he changed right before the race and ran with us			2
that blew my mind ! there were so many little details of that day that really meant a lot to me			0
for instance , my former high school track and field coach was contacted to be the starter of the race			2
so many of my colleagues came to work the race and help wherever they were needed ; more came to run or walk			2
to think that they we all there to support me was unbelievably overwhelming , to say the least			0
@entity8 may focus on the @entity130 -- strangers who were selected to do a single triathlon			2
but it 's also about making healthy changes , and inspiring our family and friends to do the same , and then taking that message to the community and beyond			1
i think we accomplished that with @entity36			0
at the end of the day , i said a lot of thank - you 's , shook many hands and gave a lot of hugs			2
i beat my @entity2 goal by over 30 seconds and decided that , based on the feedback from everyone involved ( and many who wished that they could have made it ) , @entity36 is going to be an annual event			1
same day , same time , same place			0
save the date ! you have more to lose than pounds why i gave up soda			0
