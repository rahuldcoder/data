-- @entity1 is today a shattered society , shaped by two major international wars , bombings , debilitating sanctions , civil war , emigration of millions of its best - educated people , deadly insurgency and counterinsurgency and foreign occupation over 20 years			1
while @entity1 never achieved full unity after it was cobbled together by the @entity18 in 1920 from three large and mutually alien communities -- the @entity20 in the northern highlands , the @entity12 in the central plains and the partly @entity15 - speaking @entity14 in the southern lowlands -- @entity1 had made great social and economic progress			2
by 1990 , it was the most advanced of the @entity25 countries			0
now that is all gone			0
yet , even today , there is a memory of collective statehood , or @entity30			1
some of us who have lived among the @entity1 believe they have a chance to invigorate a new beginning of @entity30 but that the return to something like the state that existed before will take years			2
how is the @entity40 withdrawal regarded ? my hunch , from having known @entity1 and @entity1 of all persuasions for more than half a century , is that most will be happy to see us leave			1
but , at the same time , they have learned to fear one another , so their politically effective attitudes will vary from one community to the next			2
insofar as there are winners from these destructive years , it is the @entity52			0
with our help , they emerged to control the government and such armed forces as exist			0
most of their leaders have lived and studied in @entity62 theological institutions , so they see @entity62 as a friend and patron			0
more recently , they have made beneficial economic and diplomatic contact with @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and members of the @entity70			0
thus , while the ( @entity14 ) @entity1 government realizes that the @entity40 ( inadvertently ) helped them to power , that time is past , and an @entity74 could pose dangers			1
better , they would conclude , that @entity74 be gone			0
for the @entity20 , the answer is different			0
they have benefited from the destruction of the @entity80 central government to establish a vigorous mini-state under the @entity82			1
the @entity14 @entity1 regime is unlikely to challenge @entity85 autonomy			2
and if it manages to keep the giant oil field at @entity87 , the @entity82 could underwrite its autonomy economically			2
but , with the @entity40 gone , the @entity82 faces one danger : their people , as distinct from their state , spill over into @entity92 , @entity62 and @entity93			1
revanchist movements of @entity20 in those countries have brought upon the @entity82 attacks and may bring more severe attacks once the @entity40 hand is withdrawn			1
thus , the @entity82 should favor at least a strong @entity40 influence in their neighborhood			1
the @entity80 have been the big losers in this long and dreadful conflict			1
a whole generation of their educated elite have fled the country , tens of thousands have been killed , hundreds of thousands wounded			0
most of their property has been looted , seized or burned			0
the dangers posed by the @entity52 are still clear and present			0
surely , one would think , despite the memory of the @entity40 role in these events , they would like the @entity40 to stay to prevent the @entity52 from further action against them			1
no , i find that is not true			0
they , above all other @entity1 , were the nationalists , raised on efforts to eject the @entity18 and then to overthrow the @entity18 puppets ; for them , getting rid of foreign manipulation was always the ultimate objective			2
so , although they might hope that @entity74 's hostility to @entity62 would spill over into @entity1 to their advantage , they share with the @entity52 and the @entity20 satisfaction that the @entity40 are nearly gone			1
but are the @entity40 really nearly gone ? are any of the hopes or beliefs of the @entity1 likely to be fulfilled ? the @entity40 is reportedly doubling the size of its embassy personnel from 8,000 to 16,000 , with about 200 military personnel remaining to assist them			1
so long as hostility to @entity62 remains the governing policy in the @entity136 , @entity1 remains pivotal			1
the same geostrategic appreciation , but focused on @entity68 and the @entity139 oil states , governed @entity18 policy in the 1930s and 1940s			0
there is no sign the basic policy has changed by the move from @entity146 to @entity147			0
while at least the more abrasive aspects of the @entity40 presence in @entity1 are likely to diminish , i believe that in the eyes of all three groups of @entity1 , the withdrawal will be regarded as cosmetic rather than real			1
in this event , it seems likely that the current friction among at least @entity74 , the @entity80 rebels and the @entity14 government will not abate much while the @entity20 will continue to cultivate their close but covert relationship with @entity160			2
and if @entity74 's relationship with @entity62 worsens , the @entity20 and @entity40 will draw closer			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity1 is a shattered society , yet there is a memory of collective statehood , says @entity164
@entity171 : most @entity1 will be happy to see us leave , but they have also learned to fear one another
