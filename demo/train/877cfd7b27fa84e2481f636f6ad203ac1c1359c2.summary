-- the family of the late @entity2 released a report sunday morning that absolved the coaching great of blame in the @entity7 child sex abuse scandal and said a prior review commissioned by @entity9 was " factually wrong , speculative and fundamentally flawed			1
" former attorney general @entity11 put together the new report , the @entity2 family said in a written statement			1
" the experts determined that the conclusions of the ( university ) report are based on raw speculation and unsupported opinion -- not facts and evidence , " @entity11 said , according to the statement			2
@entity23 , who authored the university report released in july , said the family review was " self - serving			1
" @entity27 's statement the former @entity29 director said @entity2 and three other former university officials showed no empathy for @entity7 's victims and chose not to report his conduct to authorities			2
" i stand by our conclusion that four of the most powerful people at @entity9 failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade , " @entity23 said in a lengthy written statement			2
the family statement said @entity2 never attempted to hide any information or impede any investigation into @entity7 's activities while using @entity9 facilities			2
the university responded to the report , saying @entity23 had been tasked with conducting an internal review to identify failures in the school 's response to allegations			1
" it is understandable and appreciated that people will draw their own conclusions and opinions from the facts uncovered in the @entity23 report , " @entity9 said in a written statement			1

official : @entity9 paid @entity2 's estate $ 5.76 million after his death @entity23 's 267 - page review blamed @entity2 , former university president @entity72 , suspended athletic director @entity74 and @entity76 president @entity75 for allegedly taking part in a cover - up to avoid bad publicity			1
the family disputed that , saying the " allegation is false " that @entity2 participated in a conspiracy			2
the @entity2 family review also skewered the @entity23 report for failing to interview key witnesses , allowing some to testify anonymously and using an incomplete string of e-mails for evidence			1
most of the e-mails from that time are unavailable , the family said			0

a lawyer for one of @entity7 's victims said sunday that @entity2 should have taken action after reports of @entity7 's behavior			0
the family 's complaints about witnesses and e-mails " do not erase the shocking and striking documents which @entity23 did uncover and which form an unassailable finding made by mr. @entity23 that @entity2 tragically had knowledge in 1998 and again in 2001 that @entity7 was a threat , which was never dealt with properly by the former @entity9 coach , " said @entity108 , attorney for victim no. 5 in the @entity7 trial			1
in an online letter to @entity9 's current and former players , @entity2 's widow , @entity125 , wrote on friday : " the @entity23 report failed and if it is not challenged and corrected , nothing worthwhile will have come from these tragic events			1
" the family , she said , wants a full record of what happened			0
the university panicked after the @entity23 report was released , she claimed , and @entity9 's board of trustees should have challenged the report			1
@entity9 review recasts story of football hero @entity2 she told the players that they -- and his family -- were @entity2 's legacy , not a report			1
she also criticized the @entity23 report 's depiction of her husband			1
" when the @entity23 report was released last july , i was as shocked as anyone by the findings and by mr. @entity23 's extraordinary attack on @entity2 's character and integrity			1
i did not recognize the man mr. @entity23 described , " she said			0
the university 's board of trustees fired @entity2 after a 46 - year career because , it said , his " decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership			2
" in july , the @entity156 imposed on @entity9 some of the most severe penalties ever , including a $ 60 million fine			0
the governing body of major college sports also vacated @entity9 's football wins dating back to 1998 , the year when allegations that @entity7 was abusing children were first made			0
