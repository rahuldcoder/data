@entity0 , @entity1 -- the dock on @entity4 off the coast of @entity1 's @entity7 prefecture has sunk by half a meter because of last year 's @entity1 earthquake			1
walking along the cracked and sandbagged quayside , oyster farmer @entity10 spies his fishing gear that has been lying untouched for over a year			1
in fact the 37 - year - old has never used it to fish with ; he moved from @entity16 to @entity0 , part of the @entity18 , just one day before the devastating tsunami struck			1
@entity10 was safe on a bridge when the huge black wall of water swept almost all before it , destroying his new fishing boat and making the house he had spent only one night in uninhabitable			1
he 's one of thousands whose homes and livelihoods were ruined			0
the @entity29 government has estimated that around 90 % of fishing boats from @entity31 , @entity7 and @entity33 prefectures were destroyed by the tsunami			1
" in a way , ( the tsunami ) has made it easier to fit into the community , " he said , mentioning how lifelong residents of the islands are often quite insular			1
" a positive thing was that it made everyone come together			0
i was an outsider and many were kind to me			0
" the quiet life @entity10 hoped for after quitting a job at a lumber company in @entity16 is still to be realized , and some residents of @entity0 do n't think fishing , a way of life for all on the @entity18 and livelihood for most of the communities along the @entity56 coast of @entity1 , is possible anymore			1
" there 's not much future for fishing here , " said 75 - year - old former fisherman mr. @entity57 , a lifelong resident of @entity0			2
however @entity10 sees things differently			1
even though only one oyster processing factory is still functioning and a third of fishermen of the @entity18 remain , he is determined to revive his new community and create a sustainable fishing industry			1
just a month after the tsunami , @entity10 set up " @entity68 " ( @entity69 ) , a cooperative project for fishermen from the @entity18 and outside " stakeholders			1
" the stakeholders ' donations to help the area 's recovery will eventually be repaid with fishermen 's produce like oysters and seaweed			0
@entity10 used @entity81 and @entity82 to promote the project , and since april 2011 over 14,000 people from across the world have sent donations			1
" i did n't want ( fishermen on the islands ) to quit , " he said			2
" i was n't a fisherman before			0
it 's very hard to be a fisherman			0
if i could succeed , it could help those who quit to come back			0
" but @entity10 's plan has n't been without some controversy			1
some of his ideas have been hard for some of the established fishermen and the local @entity100 's guild to digest			0
" at first many local fishermen did n't have a clue what i was doing , like planning some innovative ideas and selling to new markets			0
it has taken time to convince them			0
" before , let 's just say that communication did n't happen often between islanders , " he said , explaining that the @entity100 's @entity99 had a tight hold on how fishing was regulated and before the tsunami most fishermen operated as individuals			2
more than half of @entity7 's fishermen are over 50 , but some of the younger residents of the @entity18 are happy to follow @entity10 's lead			1
mr. @entity122 , who returned to the area from @entity124 to help his father 's fishing business on nearby @entity127 , says he 's open to @entity10 's plans , but he currently has to work in construction as well fishing to make a living			1
the tsunami has actually made this a good year for the bay 's oyster beds , as it brought in nutrients from the deep ocean , although this year 's harvest will still be half what was produced before the tsunami			2
forecasts are for oyster and seaweed production to return to pre-tsunami levels by 2014 , but if the bay 's sea life is sure to recover , the life for those ashore is much less certain			0
even @entity10 's project has changed from what he first thought it would be			1
while support from individuals and @entity154 has been forthcoming , the @entity151 was created to help manage the project and @entity29 medical company @entity157 became a partner			1
executives from the company now sit on the board , along with @entity10 and members from the @entity99			2
it 's part of a wider phenomenon of companies in @entity1 partnering or helping previously independent communities or cooperatives affected by the earthquake			2
" many companies want to help the communities recover , but after two years when the local economy gets better , who knows what may happen , " said professor @entity169 of @entity170 , who has studied the economics of post-tsunami recovery plans			2
" some companies may want more and more return for their investment , " he added			0
" but you ca n't say what is right or wrong for these communities , they are all quite different , some more isolated than others , some more damaged than others			0
many traditional communities will be okay without companies , so there is no one solution			0
" the simple life of a fisherman still eludes @entity10 , administering the @entity193 now takes nearly all of his time			2
" now there are lots of different opinions , and it makes it much more difficult , " he said			0
" i just want to be able to prepare my own boat and fish			0
" unfortunately that day still seems a long way off .			0
