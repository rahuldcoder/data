-- hoping to solve numerous cold cases , authorities on thursday released more than a hundred photos of unidentified women and children found in a storage unit that belonged to a serial killer who appeared on " @entity8			1
" investigators are trying to determine if some of the people in the pictures were victims of @entity13 , 66 , who was convicted in february of murdering a child and four women between november 1977 and june 1979			1
a jury this week recommended a death sentence for @entity13 , who appeared on the popular dating show in 1978 as bachelor no. 1			1
" we balanced the privacy concerns of those depicted in the decision to release these pictures , " @entity21 district attorney @entity20 said in a statement			0
" although we hope that the people depicted are not victims , we believe the release may help solve some cold cases and bring closure to victims ' families			2
" see all the photos a few pictures of men were also found among the portrait - style photos that were discovered in a storage unit that @entity13 kept in @entity40 , @entity41 , said @entity42 , a spokeswoman for the district attorney 's office			1
the locker also contained earrings that belonged to 12 - year - old @entity47 , who @entity13 abducted and killed in 1979 , @entity42 said			1
the discovery of the earring in the locker has raised speculation that there may be other victims or that the photographs were trophies to @entity13 , she said			1
" the idea is to figure out if these are other victims that belong to other cold cases and if they are we can hopefully bring some closure to these victims ' families , " she said			2
" we know that mr. @entity13 used his photography as a ruse to get close to his victims			1
" authorities already believe that @entity13 may be responsible for deaths in @entity68 , @entity42 said			1
" it 's very possible , " @entity42 said			2
" mr. @entity13 is a predatory monster and we believe that he destroyed many lives everywhere he went			1
" according to the @entity21 district attorney , @entity13 was convicted in 1972 of kidnapping and molesting a child in @entity75 in 1968			1
after serving a 34 - month sentence , he was released			0
in november 1977 , @entity13 raped , sodomized and murdered @entity78 , an 18 - year - old @entity79 who had recently moved to @entity81 , the district attorney said			1
" the defendant used a large rock to smash in the victim 's face , causing blunt force trauma , and strangled her to death by tying her belt and pant leg around her neck			0
he then left the victim 's body in a mountainous area in the foothills near @entity95			0

all this occurred before @entity13 charmed " @entity8 " contestant @entity120 in 1988			2
though @entity121 chose @entity13 as her date , she reportedly refused to go out with him			2
@entity13 may have appeared likable to viewers at home , but @entity125 , @entity126 , said he was the complete opposite when they sat together in the green room before the show			2
@entity131 said he had an almost immediate aversion to @entity13			2
" something about him , i could not be near him , " @entity131 recalled			0
" he was very obnoxious and creepy -- he became very unlikable and rude and imposing as though he was trying to intimidate			0
i wound up not only not liking this guy ... not wanting to be near him ... he got creepier and more negative			0
he was a standout creepy guy in my life			0
" @entity131 said he still has a difficult time discussing @entity13			2
" just talking about it , i get a tightness in my stomach , " he said , " it kind of sinks in slowly			0
what this guy did , it 's hard to express			0
he kind of haunts me a bit			0
" two more slayings followed the year after @entity13 appeared on the show			2

based on a semi-rare blood match , @entity13 was linked to the murder , " the district attorney 's web site said			1
though he was charged with killing @entity149 , the case was dismissed after his first conviction in the @entity47 case			0
in that case , @entity13 approached a 12 - year - old at the beach in @entity170 and asked her to pose for pictures , after which she rode off on her bicycle toward a dance class , the district attorney said			1
she did not make it			0
" the defendant kidnapped and murdered @entity47 and dumped her body near @entity179 in the foothills of the @entity181 , " the district attorney 's web site said			0
