-- the @entity2 movement is trying to define politics in 2010 , but its founding arguments can be traced to at least 1964 -- in a famous campaign speech given on @entity7 's behalf by a @entity9 actor named @entity10			1
" this is the issue of this election : whether we believe in our capacity for self - government or whether we abandon the @entity17 revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far - distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves			2
" " no nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income			0
... we 've raised our debt limit three times in the last 12 months , and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world			0
we have $ 15 billion in gold in our treasury ; we do n't own an ounce			0
" " our natural , unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government , and freedom has never been so fragile , so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment			0
" the nationally televised address , known as " @entity46 , " is a classic -- smart , funny and still so resonant that the rhetoric @entity10 used more than 50 years ago echoes in @entity2 protests today			1
@entity10 tried to raise the stakes of the election with a vision of apocalyptic ideological conflict , pitting heroic defenders of the @entity56 ' vision against big - state bureaucrats , willfully wasting taxpayer dollars on counterproductive do - gooder programs that are dragging @entity17 toward socialism			1
consistent with the @entity2 's self - image , it was primarily an economic speech , advancing a small - government libertarian economic philosophy , making statistics come alive with talk of fallen empires and @entity17 history , arguments aided by the added urgency of global conflict with communism			1
there is the specter of growing government power eclipsing the @entity77 , the perverse incentives of the welfare state as an insult to hardworking individuals , all culminating in a citizens ' resistance against elite liberals ruling by fiat from @entity86			0
it is compelling stuff , with the pitch - perfect delivery of a trained actor finally getting to recite his own lines			0
speakers echo its themes from stages today almost like a tribute band			0
but , of course , times have changed a lot since 1964 -- and so some questions arise			0
first , if @entity17 's past was as idyllic as many @entity2 protesters seem to believe , how come @entity10 was warning about @entity17 's eclipse back when the " @entity106 " was still in prime time ? well , the top marginal tax rate was a whopping 70 percent then -- almost double what it is today , and down from 90 percent just a year earlier			1
that 's cause for a serious debate about socialism			0
it 's a reminder that the past was never pure and simple -- though some @entity17 might remember it that way because they were children then			2
second , @entity10 's speech did not mention civil rights , despite the fact that it was one of the dominant issues of that election			1
both @entity10 and @entity7 opposed the @entity122 on constitutional grounds , and it was this rift that @entity126 candidate @entity125 was referring to when he awkwardly affirmed libertarians ' opposition to civil rights legislation			1
that does not mean that @entity10 or @entity7 were racist -- just as it is mistake to label the @entity132 of today racist -- but that heroic fight was n't their primary or even secondary concern , nor was it that of their conservative constituents			1
not coincidentally , the former @entity139 states of the @entity140 realigned in 1964 , with traditionally @entity142 @entity141 voting 87 percent for the @entity143			0
another key difference between @entity10 's rhetoric and today is the comparative civility			1
@entity10 never attacks then - president @entity147 by name , and he is even careful to use the phrase " our liberal friends " when slapping the domestic left			2
he does not question their patriotism or call them communists -- after all , the @entity153 was still on , and that insult seemed more idiotic and offensive than it does now			0
there is a final irony -- the @entity10 who was elected governor of @entity163 in 1966 and ran for president in 1980 would have a hard time getting the @entity143 nomination today			1
the self - appointed sentinels of conservatism would have taken issue with the fact that as governor , @entity10 raised taxes by a billion dollars to close a budget gap and increased the size of the state workforce by 50,000			2
he also raised taxes as president			0
social conservatives might not have liked the fact that he opposed a bill to ban gays and lesbians from teaching in public schools -- a legislative fight depicted in the movie " milk " -- and they would have hated that he signed the nation 's most liberal abortion bill into law			1
@entity10 would n't have been alone in his isolation from contemporary conservative absolutists -- even @entity7 could be painted as liberal today because of his support for gays in the military and the fact that his wife co-founded @entity197 in his home state of @entity199 in the 1930s			1
@entity7 lost the 1964 campaign by an unprecedented margin , winning only six states and 38 percent of the popular vote			1
apparently , most @entity17 did believe that extremism in defense of liberty was a vice			2
but by 1966 , a @entity210 backlash was in full effect , and the excesses of the radicalized so - called " @entity213 " ushered in a 40 - year @entity143 revival on the presidential level , punctuated only by @entity216 and @entity217			0
it is strange that despite the conservative movement 's decades in power , @entity10 's rhetoric is still used without much adjustment or abridgement			1
is that because conservatives failed to tame the beast they warned about , or because the arguments worked so well on an emotional level that they exist separately from any era 's political reality ? the arguments in " @entity46 " work best when it is a rallying cry of a party out of power -- in part because a belief in government 's corruptibility is less compelling when you control it			0
but @entity17 's character does not change dramatically with a new president , no matter what party or ideology he represents			2
@entity147 did not represent a mortal threat to the @entity17 experiment , and @entity10 deepened the deficits he warned were in danger of bankrupting the nation			2
both men upheld their oath to protect and defend the @entity77 while helping our nation fight and ultimately defeat communism			0
by uncovering the roots of the @entity2 's rhetoric , we can see it with a dose of perspective			1
@entity17 is still faced with great challenges , but our country is no closer to constitutional apocalypse now than it was then -- and in most respects our country has gotten better since 1964 , evolving just a bit closer to our ideals of liberty and equality			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity272 .			0

@entity272 : @entity2 's roots in 1964 speech given by @entity10 for @entity7 campaign
in speech more civil than today 's , @entity10 envisioned lost freedoms , he writes
@entity272 says that time not as idyllic as some think and @entity17 is more conservative today
@entity272 : conservatives today would call @entity10 , @entity7 , liberal on social views , taxes
