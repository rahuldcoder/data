@entity0 -- in energy - sapping conditions , the @entity2 hardly had to bare their teeth to comprehensively beat the @entity5 59 - 8 in the first match of their rugby tour to @entity9			1
" it was a good run - out and what we wanted			2
it was a little tougher than the scoreline suggests , " @entity2 head coach @entity13 said after the match in @entity0			1
" i think the scoreline reflected our dominance			0
i was genuinely very , very pleased with that today			2
it was tough out there			0
the players said ( the ball ) was a like a bar of soap with the humidity and the heat			0
" in the hot and sticky night air -- the temperature hovering around @entity28 in the windless @entity29 -- the @entity2 ran in eight tries to one against the scratch team of internationals that last weekend had lost 40 - 12 to @entity34			1
led by the normally dynamic captain of @entity36 , @entity37 , who said the conditions were the toughest he 'd played in , the @entity5 forwards seemed determined to physically test their opposition early on			1
@entity42 fullback @entity41 , the @entity2 ' youngest player at 20 , looked to get his tour off on a positive note but the beginning of a scything run a couple of minutes into the match was brought to juddering halt by a crunching tackle by @entity5 center @entity49			1
then after just eight minutes @entity52 @entity51 , forgetting any club loyalty , sent a punch towards his @entity56 teammate and @entity2 flyhalf @entity57 , earning the @entity5 ' hooker a yellow card and 10 minutes off the field			1
it could easily have been red			0
" from our point of view , the good thing is that @entity57 was n't injured or knocked out , and from a rugby perspective i 'm glad ( @entity51 ) was n't sent off , it was just a yellow card , because it would have been less of a workout for us and the rugby as a spectacle , " said @entity13			2
" one of the things we 're going the emphasize very strongly is to make sure we keep our discipline			0
it 's going to be hugely important for us			0
sometimes you need to take one for the team , you need to get ' whacked ' and you ca n't retaliate because the consequences of that retaliation can be pretty severe as well			0
" swinging arms aside , there was little of note to get the 28,643 spectators excited about in a slow - paced first half until @entity86 lock and match - day captain @entity84 lunged over the line for the first try of the @entity2 tour			1
soon after , @entity92 scrumhalf @entity91 ' darting run from the back of a ruck extended the @entity2 ' lead to 20 - 3 , while @entity57 slotted over a last - minute penalty to make the score 23 - 3 at halftime			1
another @entity99 try , touched down with a swallow dive three minutes after the restart and converted by @entity57 , killed the match as a contest and put the @entity2 30 - 3 ahead			1
the tries then came regularly as the game opened up			0
so too did the handling errors , especially for @entity57 , who , while dead - eyed with the boot often seemed to have his palms smeared with treacle ; what seemed a certain try for the @entity2 was denied by @entity5 fullback @entity113 when he swatted the ball out of the path of @entity116 from an overhead @entity57 pass			1
the lone try for the @entity5 -- a breakaway effort after 58 minutes by @entity120 -- was only limited respite from the one - way traffic as the @entity2 continued to dictate play			1
a misplaced pass by the @entity5 in their own 22 later led to a try for @entity2 center @entity126 before @entity92 winger @entity128 ran in two tries to push the score to 47 - 8 , while his compatriots @entity131 and @entity133 completed the rout			1
@entity84 was pleased with the performance from a team that has only had a few weeks to bond			2
" you just want to get into it , " he said			0
" we can show guys the video now ( from the match ) the chats will begin amongst players and the tour really starts and takes off from here			2
for some of us being in camp for three weeks -- three weeks without a game is a long time , so it 's great to get the tour started			0
the squad fly to @entity153 sunday for their first game against @entity156 opposition , the @entity155 , on wednesday			0
@entity13 was content to get his team through their sweltering @entity0 experience unscathed , and was encouraged by the players ' performances			1
" going forward i think these players that have played tonight have laid down a marker and the players that get picked and play against the force they will know they will have to perform , " the @entity161 said			0
" today 's performance was n't about @entity9 it was about us , and us putting down some foundations in place ; the first two or three games are about that			2
" we 'll start concentrating on looking at the @entity156 sides more closely than we have because the focus has been getting this first game under our belts , we 'll look at the tapes of their recent performances and the buildup to that first test in @entity182			0
" " we 're well aware that in @entity153 the microscope is going to be on us a heck of a lot more than it has been at the moment			0

@entity2 begin tour with a 59 - 8 win against @entity5 in @entity0
lions score eight tries against the international selection ahead of trip to @entity9
coach @entity13 : " i was genuinely very , very pleased with that . it was tough . "
