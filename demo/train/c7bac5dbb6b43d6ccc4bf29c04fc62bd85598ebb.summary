-- war and humor make strange bedfellows , but in the absurdity of @entity7 's nearly three - year civil war , one town has made laughter a form of resistance			1
from caricatures of @entity7 president @entity19 with a skunk 's body and chemical weapons smoking from his bottom to posters reading " rebuilding houses takes some time , but humanizing @entity12 can never happen " the northern town of @entity14 has gained fame for its satirical portrayal of the conflict			1
we want to live and we need to live			2
we need to send a message to the world that we are human and we want to live , " said @entity29 , head of the opposition @entity14 media center			1
in its latest comedic production , an amateur cast of activists , civilians and @entity38 rebels dressed like cavemen and mocked the inaction of the international community in a video called " @entity14 : the @entity44 in @entity45			1
" " i thought it would be good to use cavemen because of the language			2
i do n't need to translate or say anything ; everybody all over the world can understand without talking , " said @entity29 , who produced and directed the video			1
in the first two scenes , the cavemen demonstrate against @entity19 only to be killed first by gunfire then by @entity57 , but when the oppressors fire chemical weapons , previously uninterested bystanders representing the international community intervene to confiscate the gas			1
in the final scene , the killing continues sans chemical weapons and with approving thumps from the international community			0
" something was very wrong with ( president @entity68 ) @entity68 's actions that he will strike @entity19 just to get rid of chemical weapons			2
it was like he was arresting the weapons and letting the criminal go free , " fares said			0
the media - savvy group received tens of thousands of views for its latest production and boasts a large audience on @entity80 , where its members post pictures of the caustic placards carried in the group 's weekly friday demonstrations against the government			0
" i do n't trust governments all over the world anymore			0
i trust people , so i try to touch the people all over the world and explain our revolution			0
that it 's not like the regime keeps trying to show it like a civil war or a war against terrorism			0
we are humans who need our freedom and our dignity , but he killed us , " fares said .			0
