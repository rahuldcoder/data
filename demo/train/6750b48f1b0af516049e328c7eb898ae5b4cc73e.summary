-- most of us have become so used to suppressing noise that we do n't think much about what we 're hearing , or about how we listen			1
yet our well - being is now being seriously damaged by modern sound			1
here are 10 things about sound and health that you may not know : 1			1
) you are a chord			2
this is obvious from physics , though it 's admittedly somewhat metaphorical to call the combined rhythms and vibrations within a human being a chord , which we usually understand to be an aesthetically pleasant audible collection of tones			1
but " the fundamental characteristic of nature is periodic functioning in frequency , or musical pitch , " according to @entity27			2
matter is vibrating energy ; therefore , we are a collection of vibrations of many kinds , which can be considered a chord			2
) one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony			1
the @entity39 defines health as " a state of complete physical , mental , and social well - being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity " which opens at least three dimensions to the concept			1
on a philosophical level , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 all wrote at length about the relationship between harmony , music and health ( both social and physical )			1
here 's @entity49 : " rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul , on which they mightily fasten , imparting grace , and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful , or of him who is ill - educated ungraceful			2
" watch an interview with @entity71 3			1
) we see one octave ; we hear ten			1
an octave is a doubling in frequency			2
the visual spectrum in frequency terms is 400 - 790 @entity79 , so it 's just under one octave			0
humans with great hearing can hear from 20 hz to @entity83 , which is ten octaves			1
) we adopt listening positions			0
listening positions are a useful set of perspectives that can help people to be more conscious and effective in communication -- because expert listening can be just as powerful as speaking			0
for example , men typically adopt a reductive listening position , listening for something , often a point or solution			0
women , by contrast , typically adopt an expansive listening position , enjoying the journey , going with the flow			0
when unconscious , this mismatch causes a lot of arguments			0
other listening positions include judgmental ( or critical ) , active ( or reflective ) , passive ( or meditative ) and so on			0
some are well known and widely used ; for example , active listening is trained into many therapists , counselors and educators			0
) noise harms and even kills			1
there is now wealth of evidence about the harmful effect of noise , and yet most people still consider noise a local matter , not the major global issue it has become			1
according to a 1999 @entity123 @entity125 report , @entity123 named noise as the number one problem in neighborhoods			1
of the households surveyed , 11.3 percent stated that street or traffic noise was bothersome , and 4.4 percent said it was so bad that they wanted to move			1
more americans are bothered by noise than by crime , odors and other problems listed under " other bothersome conditions			1
" @entity141 : music is medicine , music is sanity the @entity146 says : " around 20 % of the @entity146 's population or close on 80 million people suffer from noise levels that scientists and health experts consider to be unacceptable , where most people become annoyed , where sleep is disturbed and where adverse health effects are to be feared			1
an additional 170 million citizens are living in so - called ' grey areas ' where the noise levels are such to cause serious annoyance during the daytime			1
" the @entity39 says : " traffic noise alone is harming the health of almost every third person in the @entity162			1
one in five @entity163 is regularly exposed to sound levels at night that could significantly damage health			1
" the @entity39 is also the source for the startling statistic about noise killing 200,000 people a year			1
its findings ( @entity172 report ) estimate that 3 percent of deaths from ischemic heart disease result from long - term exposure to noise			1
with 7 million deaths a year globally , that means 210,000 people are dying of noise every year			1
@entity141 : @entity181 on kids transformed by music the cost of noise to society is astronomical			1
the @entity146 again : " present economic estimates of the annual damage in the @entity146 due to environmental noise range from eur 13 billion to 38 billion			2
elements that contribute are a reduction of housing prices , medical costs , reduced possibilities of land use and cost of lost labour days			0
" ( @entity197 1996 )			0
then there is the effect of noise on social behavior			1
the @entity123 report " @entity203 and its effects " ( @entity205 , @entity206 , 1991 ) says : " even moderate noise levels can increase anxiety , decrease the incidence of helping behavior , and increase the risk of hostile behavior in experimental subjects			2
these effects may , to some extent , help explain the " dehumanization " of today 's urban environment			0
" perhaps @entity51 and @entity49 have a point			0
" @entity225 " describes a state where what you hear and what you see are unrelated			2
the word was coined by the great @entity228 audiologist @entity227 and was intended to communicate unhealthiness			0
@entity227 explains : " i coined the term schizophonia intending it to be a nervous word			0
related to schizophrenia , i wanted it to convey the same sense of aberration and drama			0
" my assertion that continual schizophonia is unhealthy is a hypothesis that science could and should test , both at personal and also a social level			0
you have only to consider the bizarre jollity of train carriages now -- full of lively conversation but none of it with anyone else in the carriage -- to entertain the possibility that this is somehow unnatural			0
old - style silence at least had the virtue of being an honest lack of connection with those around us			0
now we ignore our neighbors , merrily discussing intimate details of our lives as if the people around us simply do n't exist			2
surely this is not a positive social phenomenon			0
compressed music makes you tired			0
however clever the technology and the psychoacoustic algorithms applied , there are many issues with data compression of music , as discussed in this excellent article by @entity274 back in 1991			0
my assertion that listening to highly compressed music makes people tired and irritable is based on personal and anecdotal experience - again it 's one that i hope will be tested by researchers			0
headphone abuse is creating deaf kids			1
over 19 percent of @entity123 12 to 19 years old exhibited some hearing loss in 2005 - 2006 , an increase of almost 5 percent since 1988 - 94 ( according to a study in the @entity286 by @entity288 et al , reported with comments from the researchers here )			0
one university study found that 61 percent of freshmen showed hearing loss ( @entity294 2001 )			0
many audiologists use the rule of thumb that your headphones are too loud if you ca n't hear someone talking loudly to you			2
for example , @entity300 , an associate professor of audiology and speech pathology at the @entity303 , says : " if you can still hear what people are saying around you , you are at a safe level			2
if the volume is turned so loudly that you can no longer hear conversation around you , or if someone has to shout at you at a distance of about 2 or 3 feet to get your attention , then you are up in the hazardous noise range			1
" @entity141 : @entity314 shows how to listen 9			0
natural sound and silence are good for you			2
these assertions seem to be uncontroversial			0
perhaps they resonate with everyone 's experience or instinct			0
both music therapy and sound therapy can be categorized as " sound healing			2
" music therapy ( the use of music to improve health ) is a well - established form of treatment in the context of mainstream medicine for many conditions , including dementia and autism			2
less mainstream , though intellectually no more difficult to accept , is sound therapy : the use of tones or sounds to improve health through entrainment ( affecting one oscillator with a stronger one )			1
this is long - established : shamanic and community chant and the use of various resonators like bells and gongs , date back thousands of years and are still in use in many cultures around the world			0
just because something is pre-enlightenment and not done in hospitals does n't mean that it 's new - age bs			0
doubtless there are charlatans offering snake oil ( as in many fields ) , but i suspect there is also much to learn , and just as herbal medicine gave rise to many of the drugs we use today , i suspect there are rich resources and fascinating insights to be gleaned when science starts to unpack the traditions of sound healing			2
i hope these thoughts make a contribution to raising awareness of sound and its effects on health			1
i welcome your reaction , and i will check this forum and respond			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity71 .			1

@entity71 : sounds we hear have an important effect on our lives and health
noise can cause physical harm and sound can heal , he says
he says headphone abuse is creating deaf kids
more research needed to fully understand how what we hear affects our health , he says
