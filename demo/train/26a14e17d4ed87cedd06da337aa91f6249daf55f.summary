my father - in - law lives in @entity2 , @entity3 , just outside of @entity4			2
when i told him that i 'd be spending $ 350 for sushi , he burst out laughing at the outrageousness of the idea			2
but he did n't get to experience what was hands down , the best sushi of my life			2
i call it my re-education of sushi and the @entity16 food aesthetic , for that 's a more apt description of a dining experience at @entity19			1
i enjoyed sushi before i went to the restaurant			1
i just did n't understand it like a real @entity16 gourmand does			2
the restaurant is named for its owner , 85 - year - old @entity25			1
he is a serious looking , bespectacled chef who wears hearing aids in both ears , a handicap he fears makes customers think he 's aloof			2
rather , he 's concentrating on molding the rice properly , melding it to the fish just so , and serving it at the optimum time for the customer to enjoy it			0
as i take my seat before @entity25 , who stands behind the bar through the entire meal , what strikes me is how clean everything is			1
the fish must be lined up ready to go , somewhere , but it 's out of clear sight of the customer			0
the counter is absolutely spotless ; no wasabi , no utensils			0
you eat sushi the traditional way , with your hand , the way @entity25 has made it			1
" @entity57 , " says @entity25 , as he laid the first piece of @entity54 , or flatfish , in front of me			1
the rice , slightly warm and separating evenly on the tongue , tastes lightly of vinegar			0
it 's aromatic , but not strong enough to detract from the fish			0
cool , but not cold , and astoundingly not fishy			0
@entity25 eyes me as i chew , smiling approvingly as i say " mmm			1
" a universal sound -- no need for me to bust out my favorite @entity16 word , ooishi ( which means delicious )			0
as i finish that first piece of sushi , @entity25 is beginning to make the second , squid			1
a pause , enough for me to enjoy my first bite , and then the squid is ready			0
our meal continues , with a back and forth banter of sushi chef and customer			1
in between , @entity25 explains temperature is critical , which is why he makes and serves the sushi depending on the eating pace of the customer			1
he then explains why there 's no wasabi or soy sauce for the customer to add			0
" done properly , this is very tasty , " says @entity25 , talking about sushi as a collective whole			1
" but many sushi chefs just cut corners , so the flavor goes away			2
" @entity25 then bemoans the laziness of his fellow sushi chefs			1
i would take his comments seriously , except to look at how @entity25 lives his life , every other sushi chef must be considered lazy			1
@entity25 has been either training to be or been a sushi chef for more than 70 years , continuously studying the art of sushi			1
@entity25 's hands are barely wrinkled or discolored , because 45 years ago , he decided to always wear gloves outside of his restaurant			1
he does n't eat onion , garlic , smoke , drink alcohol or coffee			0
the idea is that he must be a clean palette , because his hands touch the food that will go into his customer 's mouth			2
any imperfection in him is transferred to his sushi and interferes with his customer 's culinary enjoyment			2
not that @entity25 has reached perfection , he quickly adds			1
" i 'm always thinking of how to improve my sushi , " he says			2
is that attainable , i ask			0
" not yet , " he replies			0
that personal dedication has won him accolades around the world , most notably from gourmet food guide , @entity129			1
@entity19 won the maximum three stars , the only basement restaurant to win so many stars			1
back at my re-education of sushi , i 've come to my favorite piece so far : katsuo , or seared bonito			2
i 'm truthfully not a fan of bonito , but @entity25 has seared the bonito , burning straw to create a smoky taste			1
somehow , the fish is still cool in the center but barbequed on the fringes			0
the @entity146 glutton in me wishes four more pieces would follow			0
the tuna , as you 'd expect , is melt - like - butter delicious			0
the uni , or sea urchin , something that usually ends up too fishy or bitter , is light and tasty			0
but the surprise was the last piece , the tamago , or egg			0
@entity25 has baked it so it 's slightly sweet , but still recognizable as egg			1
it 's almost like an eggy - pound cake			0
it 's an amazing finish to the meal			0
" @entity169 , " i say , the traditional @entity16 phrase said by the customer after a delicious meal			0
" @entity170 , " i add , for i am thankful and lucky			0
not just for experiencing @entity25 's delicious meal , but for understanding a little more about the beauty of @entity16 , found in the subtlety , diligence and patience of one of its finest chefs .			2

@entity25 has been a sushi chef for around 70 years
