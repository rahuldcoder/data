-- it 's not every day you read about one top - level executive asking another where his balls are			2
but in the end , former @entity6 ceo @entity5 lived up to her reputation for " salty language " and candid management style			1
since @entity5 's very public departure from @entity6 last week , her penchant for blunt , profane language has become recurring themes in discussions of her career , driving conversation about what women can and ca n't be in the workplace			1
" it stands out because it 's not expected , " said @entity21 , a linguistics professor at @entity22 and author of " @entity24 : women and men in @entity28			1
" " we always take notice of what 's unexpected and women are still not expected to curse , so when they do , it 's noticed more			2
" @entity5 got the ball rolling when she called the board members that fired her a bunch of " doofuses " who " f --- -- me over " in her first public comments after the now infamous firing - by - phone			1
those statements came two days after @entity6 chairman @entity44 called her on her cell phone last tuesday to deliver the news			2
in response , she sent an e-mail to @entity6 's 14,000 colleagues telling them " i 've just been fired over the phone by @entity6 's @entity51 " and wishing them the best			1
since then , tales of her " characteristically salty language " and perceived abrasiveness have peppered the post-mortems on her two - year tenure , which many seem to agree ended due to her failure to boost revenue and lack of long - term vision			0
even the @entity62 published an amusing compilation of " @entity5 's @entity64 , " a testament to how her " crude honesty " and " blue language " became part of her brand			1
" what do i look for when hiring ? well , let 's get past the assumption that they can do the job			0
there has to be a no - a --- --- rule , " she said in a 2010 interview with @entity78 titled , " hi , i 'm @entity5 ... are you an @entity81 --- -- ? " the attention devoted to @entity5 's candor , profane or otherwise , reflects the double - bind faced by women in the business world , especially those in high positions , @entity21 said			1
" if women talk in ways expected of them or project a feminine demeanor , it 's seen as weak			2
but if they talk in ways associated with men or bosses , then they 're seen as too aggressive , " she said			0
" whatever they do violates one or the other expectation , either you 're not talking as you should as a woman or as boss			0
" perhaps unsurprisingly , if you believe women are treated differently than men , @entity21 and others think that a dirty - mouthed man would not receive as much attention for his blue language as @entity5 has			1
" for people to call it ' salty language ' shows how we 're uncomfortable talking about women who swear			0
i do n't think anyone would describe a rapper 's language as being salty , " said former @entity116 executive @entity115 , whose book , " it 's always personal : emotions in the @entity124 , " came out this year			0
the fact that @entity5 was known for swearing , crying and confrontations also reflects the tight - lipped , buttoned - up culture pervading corporate @entity129 , @entity115 said			1
in researching her book , " emotions in the workplace , " @entity115 said she found that 60 % of employees reported never seeing their bosses get angry or display any kind of unpleasant emotion			0
" people are barely keeping it together , and that 's why this becomes a conversation point because everyone wants to be able to publicly flip off the boss one way or another			0
but you swallow it because you do n't want to lose your job , " she said			0
not everyone considers swearing in the workplace appropriate , said @entity149 , who runs @entity150 , an employee and labor relations consulting service			0
but standards vary depending on whether the workplace is a corporate office in @entity156 or a battlefield in @entity158			0
@entity6 is n't known for its culture of confrontation , which could be why @entity5 's actions -- while at @entity6 and in her public flipping - off of its board -- still has power to shock the public , @entity115 said			1
" we go through these @entity168 - like dances of ways to save face in corporate america , " @entity115 said			1
" the way she simply said , ' i 've been fired ' was brilliantly refreshing			2
she said it as blunt as she did because she was pissed off , and we rarely see that			0

profanity , candor are trademarks of @entity5 's management style at @entity6
" it stands out because it 's not expected , " professor says of her *tendency* to swear
attention devoted to language reflects " double - bind " women face in corporate america
e-mail *announcing* she was " fired " via phone " brilliantly refreshing , " author says
