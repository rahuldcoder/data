-- last week the @entity2 's senior official for extrajudicial executions , @entity4 , argued in a critical report and remarks delivered in @entity7 , @entity8 , that the @entity9 should explain the legal rationale for the @entity12 's campaign of drone strikes in northwest @entity14 , which he characterized as " a vaguely defined license to kill " that has created " a major accountability vacuum			1
" @entity4 is also urging the @entity19 administration to disclose the number of civilians killed in the drone strikes			2
that is a controversial matter among the @entity14 public , less than a tenth of whom support the strikes , because of their perceived high civilian death rate			0
the drones ' latest important victim is @entity32 , an @entity33 founding member of @entity34 who served as the group 's number three and was in charge of overseeing the group 's plots , recruitment , fundraising and internal security			2
while @entity32 's death is doubtless a blow to the terrorist group , @entity34 seems to have a stash of number threes waiting in the wings			2
at least eight men who have held that slot since 2001 have since ended up in jail or dead			0
@entity32 joins three other number threes who have met their fates at the wrong end of hellfire missiles : @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			0
@entity32 was not the only casualty from the drone strike that killed him : reports say his wife , three daughters and a grandchild also died in the may attack in the mountainous @entity14 tribal agency of @entity68 , a reminder that militant leaders are not the only ones to be felled by drones			0
according to our count , the drones program in @entity14 has reportedly killed at least 976 people since 2004 , of whom approximately two - thirds were described as militants or suspected militants in reliable press accounts , indicating that a third of the victims were not militants			0
the @entity19 administration has already authorized 90 drone strikes in and around @entity14 's @entity86 ( @entity86 ) , double the number the @entity89 administration authorized in its two terms in office			1
the accuracy of the drone strikes has improved even as the pace of the program has increased over the past two years			2
in 2008 , the first year the drones program picked up speed in @entity14 , an average of only 43 percent of the fatalities from the strikes were reported to be militants or suspected militants			0
in 2009 , that figure shot up to 62 percent , and so far in 2010 it stands at 87 percent , suggesting that the nonmilitant death rate from drone strikes has dropped to around 10 percent this year , according to our database			0
overall , since @entity19 took office , his administration 's drone strikes in @entity14 have killed an average of 71 percent militants , compared with the @entity89 administration 's 55 percent , according to reliable media accounts			1
the @entity19 administration drone strikes also seem to be having more success eliminating militant leaders , as at least 13 have been confirmed killed in drone attacks since @entity19 was inaugurated in january 2009 , compared with 16 during the @entity89 administration 's five years of authorizing drone strikes in @entity14			1
this increase in accuracy targeting both high - level and lower - level @entity34 and @entity125 members appears to stem from the @entity12 's use of smaller missiles and increased cooperation with the @entity9 ' @entity14 counterparts who , despite public protests about violations of their national sovereignty by the drone strikes , have quietly been sharing vital intelligence			1
an unnamed @entity9 official commented , " you need guys on the ground to tell you who they [ the targets ] are and that is n't coming from some white guy running around the @entity86			0
" after 26 strikes in the @entity14 tribal region of @entity146 during the first 10 months of 2009 , they halted after the start of @entity14 's military ground operations there in mid-october 2009 , another indicator of @entity9 - @entity14 cooperation about the drones program			2
as @entity14 gears up for operations in @entity68 -- the last redoubt for a militant m√©lange that includes the @entity155 , various factions of the @entity156 and @entity14 @entity125 and @entity34 -- the @entity9 has fired more drone strikes than ever into this region : 37 of 2010 's 39 reported strikes have hit targets in @entity68			1
so far no drone strikes appear to have targeted @entity162 , who occasionally releases audiotapes taunting the @entity9 as he did a few weeks after the alleged botched @entity165 attempt by an @entity34 affiliate to blow up a @entity168 passenger jet over @entity169 , but who otherwise has vanished into the wilds of the @entity156 - @entity14 border region			1
and @entity34 's number two official , @entity173 , who was last targeted by a drone strike in january 2006 , has since then proven equally elusive			1
the criticism of the drone program by the @entity2 official @entity4 seems to have had little impact on the @entity19 administration , which is plowing ahead with drone strikes in @entity14 's tribal regions on the grounds that they are " effective , exact and essential			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors			0
the @entity188 drones database is available here .			0

@entity9 drone **war*fare* claims life of @entity34 's number 3 leader , the *8th* person to hold that position
*co-authors* say data shows drone strikes getting more accurate , killing fewer civilians
they say @entity19 has stepped up drone *war* in northwest @entity14
@entity2 official has asked @entity9 to explain the legal rationale for the drone attacks
