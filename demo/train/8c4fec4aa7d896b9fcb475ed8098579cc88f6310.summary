@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 grew up in a mud shack in @entity1 's bush country			1
as a young girl , she would wistfully watch the planes pass overhead , wishing one day to fly one herself			1
in 2007 , at the age of 21 , she decided to break into the boy 's club that is @entity1 's flight industry			1
she walked to @entity12 and asked for job			2
" i ( told ) her no , we do n't employ women , " recalls @entity14 , the airfield 's technical director			1
" the whole concept of employing women in an environment where you 're clearing trees and building airplanes did n't seem to me , in my experience , to fit in with the @entity27 context , " he admits			0
@entity3 was persistent , however , and when she offered her services for free , he could n't resist giving her a trial			1
he gave her a machete and told her to clear tree trunks			0
to his surprise , she flourished			0
" she used her head , not just her muscles , " he recalls			0
" she thought about how she did things and took out the trees better than the men			0
" not only did @entity14 give her the job , he taught her how to fly , and in 2009 she became the country 's first female civilian pilot ( as well as the first woman in @entity43 certified to build and maintain @entity45 engines )			1
" i said : ' i will do whatever it takes , i 'll work hard , you do n't have to pay me			0
' they told me : ' do n't worry			0
you 've got energy , you have potential			0
we will do whatever it takes			0
' this is when my whole flying career just started to boom , " recalls @entity3			1
since then , @entity3 has been offered jobs from all over the world , but she 's decided to stay put and help grow a generation of female pilots in @entity1			1
with @entity14 , she has launched an academy called @entity64 , which aims to provide young @entity1 girls with the skills , training and inspiration they need to make it on their own as pilots			1
" there are a lot of young people ( who ) , when they see me , ( are given ) hope			2
it motivates them to learn harder because they believe women actually have something ahead of them , " she says			0
some , like @entity82 , have come from as far afield as the @entity83 to learn from @entity3			1
" she 's a very good instructor , " says @entity84			2
" she 's taught me general airfield operations -- safety , security -- ( and ) a lot culturally			2
she 's taught me the difference in the aviation industry here versus the @entity83 versus @entity91			2
" and she keeps me smiling			0

@entity3 is @entity1 's first female civilian pilot
she is also the first woman in @entity43 certified to build and maintain @entity45 engines
@entity3 grew up in a mud shack in the bush , and was *denied* a position when she first applied
she now also teaches flying to young girls in @entity1
