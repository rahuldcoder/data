-- a @entity2 state board is set friday to revisit questions surrounding a controversial 2004 execution , with supporters of the man 's family warning the panel is trying to bury its own critical review of the case			1
@entity11 was executed in 2004 for a fire that killed his three daughters			2
prosecutors argued that @entity11 deliberately set the 1991 blaze -- but three reviews of the evidence by outside experts have found the fire should not have been ruled arson			1
the last of those reports was ordered by the @entity23 , which has been looking into @entity11 's execution since 2008			1
but a september 2009 shake - up by @entity2 gov. @entity26 has kept that panel from reviewing the report , and the commission 's new chairman has ordered a review of its operating rules			2
critics say that may kill the probe			0
" they are attempting permanently to keep the investigation from continuing and moving on , and i do believe it 's because they do n't like the direction the evidence is leading , " @entity11 's cousin , @entity35 , said thursday			1
the @entity42 's chairman is now @entity43 , an @entity44 - area district attorney with a reputation as a staunch supporter of the death penalty			1
@entity43 has pledged to state lawmakers that the @entity11 investigation " absolutely " will continue -- but said the panel needs better rules to guide its work , and could not say when the @entity11 issue would move forward			2
thursday , he told @entity0 that concerns of @entity11 's supporters were based on " a lot of misinformation			1
" " i think that 's being used very much as a side issue to politicize , through some @entity61 lawyers , the work of the commission , " @entity43 said			2
" the commission has been very clear that the commission is going to address the merits of the @entity11 case			1
" the panel meets again friday in @entity69 , and one of the items on its agenda is a legal opinion arguing that the panel has " relatively narrow investigative jurisdiction			0
" the unsigned memorandum argues that the commission 's mandate covers only cases on which a state - accredited forensic laboratory worked			0
but because @entity2 started accrediting crime labs in 2003 , @entity35 and others who have backed the family say that would mean cases such as @entity11 's and that of another inmate , @entity87 , would be dropped			1
state sen. @entity88 , who pushed for the commission 's creation , calls the opinion flawed			0
the @entity23 " was operating within the language and intent of the law when it determined that it had jurisdiction to investigate the case the first time in august 2008 , " @entity88 said in a written statement to @entity0			0
" frankly , i am surprised that the commission is even questioning whether or not it has jurisdiction , since it unanimously decided -- with the attorney general 's representative in the room -- to review the cases over two years ago			0
" @entity88 , a @entity69 @entity105 , serves as the chairman of the board of @entity108 -- the " @entity61 lawyers " that have supported efforts by @entity11 's stepmother and cousins to clear his name			1
the group advocates for prisoners it says are wrongly convicted , and @entity88 said the commission 's work " is too important to be bogged down in political bickering			0
" " @entity120 need the @entity42 to perform its work in a timely manner , so the public can once again have confidence in forensic evidence and confidence that the truly guilty are behind bars and the innocent are free , " he said			0
but @entity43 said the commission has never decided to apply the logic of the legal opinion to the case on friday 's agenda			2
@entity43 was named the panel 's chairman two days before the @entity23 was to hear from @entity135 , a @entity136 - based fire science expert			1
@entity135 concluded the arson finding at the heart of the @entity11 case " could not be sustained , " either by current standards or those in place at the time			2
the @entity108 requested the investigation after a report it commissioned reached the same conclusion			0
death - penalty opponents say an impartial review of @entity11 's case could lead to the unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man			1
@entity26 , who signed off on @entity11 's execution , is up for re-election in november , and his critics have accused him of trying to short - circuit that review			1
@entity26 has said he remains confident of the condemned man 's guilt , and police in the town of @entity161 , where the fire occurred , say other evidence beyond the arson testimony @entity135 criticized supports the prosecution			0
@entity35 , a retired nurse in @entity166 , @entity167 , told @entity0 that spiking the commission 's investigation would be a " blatant miscarriage of justice			0
" " the reasonable people of this country and the state of @entity2 can see through what this is , " she said .			0

@entity180 : " a lot of misinformation " is fueling concerns , the chairman says
new : @entity43 says the @entity23 will address the merits of the case
outside reviews say the fire in which @entity11 's daughters died was n't arson
critics say the *governor* is trying to short - circuit the review
