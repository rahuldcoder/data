@entity0 -- five close calls involving passenger jets at big @entity5 airports prompted a recommendation on monday for new rules to prevent planes from getting dangerously close to each other when one aborts a landing			1
the @entity11 recommended the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) change its standards to ensure safe aircraft separation in cases of a " go - around			1
" that 's when pilots cut short a landing at the last minute and pull up to circle the airport before making another try			1
@entity11 chairwoman @entity22 outlined four incidents in 2012 and one in 2006 when planes initiating " go - arounds " and got dangerously close to aircraft taking off or landing			1
three occurred at @entity30 's @entity29 , one at @entity34 's @entity33 airport and one at @entity36			1
airliners too close for comfort over @entity34 " the @entity11 is concerned that in these events , @entity39 ( air traffic control ) was not able to ensure the safe separation of aircraft			1
" @entity22 wrote in a letter to @entity12 administrator @entity45			2
crashes were only avoided because pilots took evasive maneuvers , she wrote			0
the @entity12 oversees air traffic operations			2
in each of the incidents , the flight paths would not have intersected had the plane landed successfully instead of conducting the " go around			0
" controllers under current rules are required to ensure there is enough space between aircraft during take offs and landings			0
but there is a gap in regulations when those paths converge during " go arounds , " the @entity11 said			0
the @entity12 said in a statement that it takes the recommendations seriously and will respond within 90 days			0
passenger plane , military helicopter come close near @entity0 the @entity12 said its thoroughly investigated the close - call incidents and took aggressive steps to address the causes			2
the incidents cited by the @entity11 include : on july 30 , 2012 , a @entity74 @entity73 was executing a go around at @entity30 and came within a quarter mile horizontally , and 100 feet vertically of a @entity76 landing on a separate runway			1
the same day at @entity78 , an @entity80 @entity79 aborted landing and came within a third of a mile horizontally and 300 feet vertically a from a @entity84 regional jet			0
the @entity11 reported the pilot of the @entity5 jet radioed " we are turning as tightly as we can " while the @entity84 pilot said on another frequency " we are trying not to hit this aircraft off our right			2
" on july 14 , 2012 , an @entity91 145 at @entity92 came within 1,000 feet horizontally and 400 feet vertically of an @entity93 that was departing			0

on january 27 , 2006 , a @entity97 @entity94 aborted a landing and came within 1,400 feet horizontally and 300 feet vertically of a departing @entity5 757 at @entity30 .			1

@entity11 concerned about near misses during aborted landings
@entity11 says standards inadequate , recommends @entity12 *improve* aircraft separation
incidents , four last year , occurred in @entity30 , @entity34 and @entity92
safety issue arises when planes *scrub* landing and then pull up to circle airport
