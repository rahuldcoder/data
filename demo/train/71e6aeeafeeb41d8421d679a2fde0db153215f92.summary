-- when the world first met @entity3 , it was as a steamboat captain , a cowboy , a wizard 's apprentice and in other roles that , while enduring , would n't exactly be considered tech - savvy to a 2013 audience			1
but before the famous mouse came along , @entity11 created a character who possessed many of the traits of today 's gadget geek -- and who maintains his technological edge over @entity3 to this day			1
oswald the @entity20 will be familiar by now to players of " @entity22 : the @entity23 , " released in november , and the original title in the series from @entity26			1
and his role in the innovative video game franchise might just be spurring a renaissance 80 years in the making for the long - forgotten character			0
in the original game , @entity20 appeared as a spurned toon jealous of @entity3 's immense popularity			1
he ultimately comes to see the famous mouse as a younger brother			0
( @entity20 was created by @entity11 in 1927			1
@entity3 appeared the following year			1
) but in their followup outing , they appear as equal partners			0
@entity41 , director of the @entity42 , said despite being the older one , @entity20 was much more into technology than his younger brother , @entity3			1
early cartoons featuring @entity20 portrayed him as a creative , mechanically inclined rabbit			2
" one of his early cartoons was called ' @entity52 , ' where he builds a robot cow , " @entity48 said			0
" the character himself is very innovative and clever			0
he winds up his own ears and makes himself into a helicopter , or he takes off an ear and uses it to row a canoe			0
" in " @entity22 , " the technology gap between the two characters remains			2
@entity20 wields a radio device that allows him shoot electricity , create electrified fields and control robotic enemies			2
@entity3 uses a magical paintbrush , allowing him to create using paint or destroy using thinner			2
in the game 's story , the two combine their divergent powers to save @entity20 's homeland from destruction ( again )			1
@entity76 blog : @entity3 spotted on @entity77 ? creative director @entity78 said @entity20 's evolution in the franchise has been designed to reintroduce him to fans after being absent since 1951			1
his techie edge combines with physical and behavioral differences to set him apart from @entity3 , @entity78 says			1
" in the second game , they start out as allies , as companions , as collaborators , " @entity78 said			0
" they 're still brothers , though , so there is still tension between them			0
@entity92 always have tension , but that does n't mean they do n't work together to accomplish common goals			0
" @entity78 said the differences between the more modern @entity20 and the old - school @entity3 is evident in their behaviors			1
he describes @entity3 as " boy scout - like , " " a good guy , " " always doing the right thing			1
" " @entity20 is more modern in a sense , because he 's a little bit less well - behaved , a little bit quicker to anger , a little bit , dare i say , edgier , " he said			1
" i think it was appropriate that he was the one who adopted the technology			0
" in the game , @entity3 's paintbrush is better at dealing with other cartoon characters , while @entity20 's high - tech gear more effectively takes on robots and other mechanical obstacles			1
" he 's a vintage character , but he has such a modern sensibility to him , " @entity48 says			0
" he 's kinda cool			0
kids , teenagers , young people and adults , they 're all finding him appealing , and he 's a really funny character			0
he 's really kinda hip , actually			0
" @entity78 said outside of the game , @entity20 has caught on with fans quicker than he would have imagined			2
" i hope it is just a start for something bigger for @entity20 , " he said			2
" he is a great character and deserves a life of his own in games and not just as @entity3 's sidekick			1
" and none of it would have been possible if the animated techie had n't once been swapped for a football announcer			0
@entity11 lost the rights to his rabbit to @entity139 shortly after creating him in 1927			1
however , when @entity140 wanted to bring sports announcer @entity141 to their sunday night football games in 2006 , @entity11 had an opportunity to bring home the wayward character			2
while there were many other parts to the deal , it is the @entity20 - for - @entity141 trade that people remember " @entity20 is definitely worth more than a fourth - round draft choice , " @entity141 said			1
" i 'm going to be a trivia answer someday			0
" @entity20 also , for the first time , gets a voice in " @entity22			1
" famed voice actor @entity155 , who did the voice of @entity157 in the @entity159 cartoons and was a voice double for @entity161 in " @entity162 : @entity162 , " was chosen to be the voice of the @entity20			2
" i think he 's probably the greatest living voice artist in the world , " @entity78 said			0
" when it came to @entity20 , ( begins to mimic @entity20 's voice ) i hear @entity20 in my head all the time , and he sounds sort of like this ( normal voice ) and they said what do you think about @entity155 , and i just said yes			1
" for all his modern tendencies and techno toys , @entity78 wants people to just look at how " cartoony -- that 's really the only word i can think of " @entity20 is , a throwback to the old days of cartooning and cartoon characters			2
" people have a tendency to think of @entity11 cartoons as being more realistic or more grounded and less anarchic and crazy and cartoony than some other studios , " he said			0
" @entity20 puts the lie to that			0
in every way that matters , @entity11 got there first			0

in " @entity22 : the @entity23 , " @entity20 steps forward
@entity20 was created by @entity11 in 1927 , a year before @entity3
designers say while @entity3 's a " @entity195 , " @entity20 is edgier
even in the 1920s , @entity20 was a gadget - obsessed techie
