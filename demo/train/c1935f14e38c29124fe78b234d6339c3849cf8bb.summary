-- just because the @entity1 has broken down geographic barriers , do n't assume that @entity3 does n't care about geography			1
with @entity3 's new latitude software , cell phone users can share their locations with others			1
the company plans to launch software called @entity11 on wednesday that lets mobile phone users share their location with close contacts			1
@entity3 hopes it will help people find each other while out and about and to keep track of loved ones			1
" what @entity11 does is allow you to share that location with friends and family members , and likewise be able to see friends and family members ' locations , " said @entity20 , product manager for @entity11			2
for example , a girlfriend could use it to see if her boyfriend has arrived at a restaurant and , if not , how far away he is			0
to protect privacy , @entity3 specifically requires people to sign up for the service			1
people can share their precise location , the city they 're in , or nothing at all			1
" what we found in testing is that the most common scenario is a symmetrical arrangement , where both people are sharing with each other , " @entity20 said			0
the software spotlights @entity3 's fixation with mapping and location technology			1
location is an important part of navigating the real world , and @entity3 clearly sees its geographic services as a way to establish a more personal connection with customers who today use @entity3 chiefly for the virtual realm of the @entity1			1
and of course money is involved , too : @entity3 hopes its mapping technology will lead to location - based advertising revenue			1
@entity3 's power is firmly lodged in search and search advertising , but the company is trying to expand to broader online services , too			2
that includes online documents and various aspects of social networking , which are much more personal services and ones that put @entity3 into more direct competition with rivals such as @entity74 , @entity75 , and @entity76			2
like using @entity3 profiles to contact information with select contacts , using @entity11 tells @entity3 who 's who in your social graph			2
how it works latitude is part of @entity86 for @entity87 , the company 's mapping software for mobile phones , but also can be used through a gadget loaded onto its igoogle customized home page			2
it 'll work in 27 countries at launch , @entity3 said			2
initially , it will work on most color - screen blackberry phones , most phones with @entity96 or later , and most @entity98 - based devices such as @entity100 smartphones			0
an update to the @entity103 now being distributed to the @entity105 phone also enables it , and @entity107 and @entity108 users will get the option " very soon , " @entity20 said			2
@entity11 uses @entity3 's technology to judge a user 's location not just by @entity113 , but also by proximity to mobile phone towers and wireless networks			1
that 's a much more automated approach than the manual " check - in " process used by @entity119 , a service that @entity3 decided in january to shut down			1
other competitors exist , though			0
@entity122 and @entity123 offer mechanisms for people to find each other by mobile phone , for example			1
then there 's @entity130 , @entity131 , and @entity132			0
and @entity3 's clearest competitor , @entity76 , offers some competition with @entity135			2
that service does n't provide location information , but it does provide a mechanism to centralize people 's geographic privacy choices , in effect taking care of some of the social graph management when it comes to location information			1
to use the service , you need a @entity3 account to record who has permission to see your location			1
for choosing who gets to see your location , you can use contacts stored with @entity156 or @entity157 , @entity3 said			1
the white lie with the service , you can hide from specific people or disappear altogether			2
and you can manually set a specific location if , for example , your phone ca n't show it with sufficient precision or if you wish to tell someone a white lie about whether you really are n't going to go to the candy store			0
@entity3 envisions two broad classes of people with whom you might want to share location information			1
first is a small , close - knit circle of friends and family with whom you 're willing to share your exact spot			0
@entity174 is a larger group with whom you 're happy to share city - level detail , convenient for finding out when somebody 's in town but not much more			1
when somebody is close , the software lets you contact the person various ways -- by calling or sending an e-mail or text message , for example			0
it also lets you hide from that specific person			0
privacy is of course a significant concern when it comes to sharing this sort of information			0
if you want to use @entity11 , you must specifically enable the service			0
meeting your pals at a bar is an obvious example of the software 's possibilities , but there are softer cases i see as useful , too			0
@entity20 pointed to a case where a friend 's girlfriend , though far away in @entity207 , will " virtually place herself next to him			0
" that sounds a little sappy for my tastes , but i can still relate			0
my wife is on the other side of the country right now , and it would be heart - warming to see just where			0
ireport.com : share your thoughts on @entity11 there are a lot of occasions where technology is better for maintaining relationships than it is for establishing them , and this looks like one to me			0
