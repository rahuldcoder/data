-- he was the first golfing superstar , and his legacy lives on more than 80 years after he made sporting history			1
the @entity4 has returned to the home club of @entity6 , who bestrode the gentleman 's game like a colossus as an amateur in the 1920s before his shock retirement			1
the only man to win golf 's four major tournaments in one year , @entity6 founded one of his own events that is now among that pantheon -- the masters			1
not only did he buy the plot of land on which he helped build the fabled @entity23 club , the @entity25 legend was also instrumental in the move towards mass - produced metal - shafted clubs that made golf more accessible to the general public			1
@entity30 claims 2010 @entity4 after last - day drama but while @entity6 is inextricably linked to @entity23 and the masters long after his death in 1971 , his real home is the @entity35			1
originally located downtown in @entity40 's capital , its course was actually the nearby @entity41 , not the present - day development in @entity43 north of the city			0
" this is his home course			0
you ca n't dispute the fact the @entity35 is his home club , and you ca n't dispute the fact that this is his home course , " @entity41 general manager @entity46 told the @entity4 's official website			1
@entity6 ' family moved to a summer house near there when he was six -- he was a sickly child who could not eat solid food , according to his descendents ' business website			2
but he thrived at @entity57 , winning the club 's junior title at the age of nine and even beating his father in a senior final when 13			0
the following year he became the youngest player to appear at the @entity64 , which then -- like its @entity67 counterpart -- was one of golf 's four major tournaments			1
however , despite his prodigious talent , it took @entity6 time to make his mark as he battled his own demons			1
he had the " face of an angel and the temper of a timber wolf " according to renowned sportswriter @entity77			0
that was best illustrated at the @entity83 when he shocked onlookers at @entity85 , the home of golf , by picking up his ball in disgust during a difficult third round and effectively disqualifying himself			2
@entity6 called it his " most inglorious failure " but he subsequently became synonymous with fair play and grace , calling a two - shot penalty on himself at the @entity94 before missing out on the title by one stroke			2
" you may as well praise a man for not robbing a bank , " he reportedly said after being praised for his gesture			0
@entity6 ' breakthrough year was 1923 , when he won the @entity94 for the first of a record four times -- triumphing in an 18 - hole playoff after almost throwing away his chances with a disastrous finish to his final round			1
between 1923 and his final year of competitive play , 1930 , @entity6 won 13 of 21 major tournaments he entered			1
a lawyer by trade , he rarely played anything but national championships and spent only three months of each year competing , much of that time in transit			2
in 1930 he finally won the @entity118 title , the first leg of his unprecedented " @entity120 , " and received a hero 's welcome when he returned to @entity123			0
it was his second such ticker - tape parade , having also been honored in 1926 when he won the @entity67 and @entity25 opens in the same year			0
" the accomplishment of the @entity120 assumes more importance as an example of the value of perseverance in the abstract than as a monument to skill in the playing of a game , " @entity6 wrote in his book " golf is my game			1
" " i am certain that in those moments when the success of the project was most in doubt , the decisive factor in each case had been my ability , summoned from somewhere , to keep control of myself and to keep trying as hard as i could , even when there was no clear indication of the direction in which hope of victory might lie			0
" @entity6 , who could have embarked on a lucrative professional career , then shocked the sporting world by deciding to quit competitive golf , calling it " a cage			1
" " first you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there			0
but of course , nobody can stay there , " he said			0
@entity6 instead began his dream of building his own course at @entity23 , and made money writing golf books and making short instructional films for @entity168 studio @entity167			1
he also helped design revolutionary standardized , numbered clubs for @entity170 that bore his name for more than 40 years , which replaced the hickory @entity174 - style shafts he had used so well			0
his family company has sold his signature equipment and clothing since 2003			0
@entity6 served in the @entity178 as a lieutenant colonel during @entity180 , but ailing health ended his playing participation at the masters after 1948			2
his best finish at his own tournament was 13th in its inaugural year 1934 , as he concentrated on his hosting duties			0
additionally , he became president of the @entity35 as his father did half a century before him , and played a significant role in its move to @entity43 in the 1960s			2
in november 1971 , just a month before his death , @entity6 wrote a letter to the @entity194 that led to his club 's @entity196 course hosting its first major tournament , the 1976 @entity94			1
" i should be most happy if my old club should become the host for my favorite golf tournament ... i can assure you that the championship will be royally entertained , " @entity6 wrote			1
" i wish i could look forward to seeing you in @entity23 again this fall , but i suppose my days there have about ended			2
" confined to a wheelchair by long - term spinal problems , @entity6 passed away at the age of 69 a week before @entity208			2
" that was an impactful letter , " @entity35 general manager @entity209 told the @entity4 website			1
" i 'm sure when the president of the @entity194 received it in 1971 he felt , ' well i really do n't have any other choice , we have to take it to the @entity35			0
" the club hosted the @entity4 for the first time in 1981 , when @entity219 won , and most recently in 2001 as fellow @entity25 @entity220 triumphed			1
visitors to this week 's tournament will be greeted by a statue of @entity6 outside the clubhouse			2
" we specifically did not pick one of him in his swing because we felt it was more important that he gave the appearance of welcoming people into the club , and one of hospitality			0
he was such a great gentleman , " @entity209 said			0
" he guided the club not just with golf but with our athletic endeavors , all our dining and social activities			0
the club was a very important place for him to be			0
