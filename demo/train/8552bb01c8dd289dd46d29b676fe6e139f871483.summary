-- a letter written by a @entity3 student leader and published monday in a @entity5 newspaper is taking @entity7 gov. @entity6 to task for his out - of - state travels			1
the letter in @entity5 's @entity11 tells readers : " @entity7 gov. @entity6 is spending more time in your state than the one he was elected to represent			1
i read almost daily about his trips to other states , which makes me believe that he is more interested in running for president than running the state of @entity7			2
" @entity21 , the letter 's author , is a 21 - year - old political science and communications major as well as @entity3 's student body president			2
the reason he wrote the letter , he said , is because he tried through traditional means of arranging a meeting to discuss education cuts with @entity6 -- but to no avail			1
" we tried to set up meetings with governor @entity6			2
we got an e-mail sent back to us from his executive assistant , telling us that his schedule was very tight , " @entity21 said			0
" but a few days after that , i started reading he was in @entity41 , @entity5 , @entity42 , @entity43			0
no wonder he has no time , he 's all over the @entity46 and not in @entity7			1
" @entity6 was in @entity5 on october 14 and in several other states recently to attend political fundraising events			2
@entity49 , @entity6 's press secretary said in a statement monday : " the governor has spent over 90 percent of the days since taking office in @entity7 , traveling to every parish multiple times			1
it 's good for @entity7 for the governor to share with business and other leaders across the country our success in outperforming the national economy			1
" in the letter , @entity21 said he wanted to ask the governor " why he 's imposing devastating budget cuts that will result in the firing of one - third of the university 's faculty and reduce enrollment by 8,000			1
" @entity3 , the victim of numerous budget cuts in recent years , is bracing for as much as a $ 62 million reduction in the future due to the state 's financial crisis			2
@entity21 said it 's that crisis facing his school that has him trying to track down the governor			2
" governor @entity6 , @entity7 higher education is about to be devastated			1
it will take a generation for our universities to recover			0
on behalf of the students whose hopes for a brighter future will soon be crushed , i beg you to return to @entity7 and fix your state 's serious problems			1
you 've neglected your constituents long enough , " @entity21 said in the letter			0
@entity49 said the governor 's chief of staff and policy director have already met with @entity21 to discuss education funding			1
" it 's great he and other students are getting involved in the political process and we hope they continue to be part of the conversation			0
we have an open dialogue with the higher education community about the state 's budget challenges and we 're working to mitigate reductions to classrooms , " @entity49 said			2
" the reality though is that higher education officials are not delivering the value our students deserve			0
that 's why we 've encouraged higher education administrative officials to prioritize reductions so that they come mainly from administrative overhead , not teaching and research			0
" @entity21 said he believed legislators should change state policy to better protect higher education and perhaps find other areas to make budget cuts in			0
despite taking the meeting request to the public stage , @entity21 said the governor 's been doing a good job and he bears no ill will towards him			1
" i 'm very satisfied with his role			0
he can really speak for the people and protect the interests of the citizens of our state , with our natural disasters and the @entity136 oil spill , " he said			0
" all i 'm asking is just for a meeting , a 30 - minute meeting on how to protect the flagship institution of our state			0
" @entity21 said he would consider voting for @entity6 if he should run for president , if he spends more time at home			1
" we need him in this state			0
look , i 'm not saying he would n't be a great presidential candidate if he ever went into something like that , but take care of your home first , and then you can move on to whatever presidential aspirations you have			0

a university student leader thinks gov. @entity6 should spend more time at home
the student wrote a letter published in a new @entity159 newspaper
the letter says @entity6 " is spending more time in your state " than his home state
a *spokesman* for the governor says he 's spent 90 percent of his time in @entity7
