-- @entity1 watched quietly as the state of @entity3 killed @entity4			1
@entity1 , a witness during @entity4 's 2007 execution , saw the condemned man 's face turn beet red as lethal fluid ran through his veins			1
beads of sweat glistened on his forehead			2
strapped to a table , his chest and stomach heaved three or four times , @entity1 recalled			1
then , at age 41 , @entity4 was gone			2
" it 's surreal when you know that the state is killing him , " said @entity1 , a @entity18 priest who counseled @entity4 in the months before he was executed for killing his ex-wife			1
" @entity24 was ready to die			2
" over the past 18 years , @entity25 has witnessed executions of two inmates he counseled on @entity3 's death row			1
he has become a student of state - sanctioned death			2
the death penalty is entering a crucial period of national scrutiny , @entity1 said , which may shape its future			1
" it 's a critical moment , " he said			2
although the number of @entity42 death row inmates stands at about 3,100 , executions dipped nearly 10 % last year , according to the @entity43			1
in the past six years , six states have ended capital punishment , according to the center			2
the tide of opposition to the death penalty has been rising in the @entity42 for two decades , according to @entity50			2
polls show the percentage of respondents opposed to it has more than doubled from 16 % in 1994 to 35 % in october			0
@entity1 views capital punishment through a unique lens			1
he 's seen it up close as a priest , but he also has the perspective of a nurse and attorney			1
after graduating with a communications degree in the early 1980s , @entity1 felt drawn to the priesthood			1
instead , he ended up at nursing school , later working as a licensed nurse at a @entity67 , @entity3 , hospital intensive care unit			1
" you saw traumas , gunshot wounds and stabbings , " he said			0
while nursing during the day , he put himself through law school , eventually moving on to work briefly as an attorney in @entity75			0
but the priesthood kept calling			0
" it was always in the back of my mind , " he said			0
he eventually settled on a life in the church , graduating from seminary school			0
the three disciplines served @entity25 well in the remarkable case of death row inmate @entity85			1
in 1988 , @entity85 , an @entity86 veteran , was arrested in the stabbing death of 19 - year - old @entity88			1
he was charged with felony murder			0
a co-defendant in the case , @entity92 , agreed to be the prosecution 's star witness			2
according to court documents , @entity95 testified that he , @entity85 and a man named @entity98 , had forced @entity88 into their truck and demanded that he help them find a mutual acquaintance named @entity103 , who had allegedly stolen drugs from them			1
@entity95 testified that , when they could n't find @entity103 , @entity98 slit @entity88 's throat and @entity85 then stabbed him to death in a @entity110 creek			1
@entity95 's police statement @entity85 , @entity1 said , had no previous criminal record			1
he had neither an alibi nor motive			0
he told @entity25 he was home alone sleeping at the time of @entity88 's killing			0
a three - judge panel convicted @entity85 and sentenced him to death			1
as @entity85 languished on death row during the appeal process , @entity1 agreed to look at his case			1
the priest saw a red flag , informed by his medical training			2
he was stunned to learn that @entity88 's knife wounds were inconsistent with @entity95 's story that @entity88 screamed after his throat was cut			0
" if this is wrong , what else might be wrong ? " @entity1 thought at the time			1
@entity133 's autopsy report @entity1 got a local newspaper reporter , @entity134 , interested in the case			1
@entity88 's father told @entity134 that , shortly before his son 's death , @entity88 had been subpoenaed in a rape case			1
@entity134 told @entity25 what he had learned			0
that 's when @entity1 's legal training came in handy			1
@entity1 pored through case files looking for information about the rape case			1
his search revealed a stunning fact : the man accused in the rape case for which @entity88 had been subpoenaed to testify was @entity103 , the same man @entity95 said they were looking for the night of the murder			2
the priest felt like his heart had dropped into his stomach			2
" the adrenaline started flowing , " he said			0
" i 'm thinking there 's no motive for @entity85 at all			1
... " a @entity42 @entity159 opinion said prosecutors " failed to disclose that @entity103 was being investigated , and had earlier been indicted , for a rape to which @entity88 was a witness			2
" a man named @entity163 testified in 2004 that @entity103 raped him shortly before @entity88 's murder			0
immediately after the alleged rape , @entity88 walked in on the two men , which gave @entity168 a chance to escape , @entity163 testified			0
@entity163 did n't tell @entity88 he had just been raped , according to @entity163			0
however , @entity163 said @entity88 knew he was upset			0
@entity163 told @entity88 that " something had just happened , " according to the testimony			0
@entity163 testified he suspected @entity88 understood what had happened			0
later , @entity163 was subpoenaed to testify against @entity103 in his rape trial , according to court documents , but @entity163 misread the subpoena and missed the trial date			0
as a result , the rape indictment against @entity103 was dismissed			0
if @entity163 's story had been introduced as evidence in @entity85 's trial , it " would have ... increased a reasonable juror 's doubt of @entity85 's guilt , " the court wrote			1
@entity1 had connected legal dots that pointed suspicion away from @entity85			1
it blew the case wide open			2
during the trial , prosecutors had n't shared this information with @entity85 's lawyers , according to the @entity193			1
" i did n't see any connection " between the rape case and @entity85 's case , trial prosecutor @entity194 told @entity0 's " @entity198			1
" it 's unlikely " someone would murder another witness to keep them from testifying			0
" read the opinion by the @entity204 of the @entity193 prosecutors also failed to share the opinion of veteran homicide detectives who disputed @entity95 's story , saying @entity88 was killed somewhere else and his body was dumped in the creek			1
read an affidavit from one of the detectives both these revelations gave @entity85 's lawyers much of the ammunition they needed to win his freedom after two decades on death row			1
" there 's never been a formal complaint filed against mr. @entity225 , " said @entity218 , disciplinary counsel for the @entity219 , which oversees grievances against judges and lawyers			0
but the court did cite @entity225 for alleged " misconduct " during a trial against @entity85 's co-defendant , @entity98			1
in front of jurors , @entity225 " stabbed a large knife into a counsel table " prompting the court to conclude " ... the prosecutor 's pattern of misconduct throughout much of the trial and during closing argument did deprive [ @entity98 ] of a fair trial			0
" @entity85 's case triggered calls for @entity3 to adopt so - called open discovery laws to force prosecutors to share much more case information with defense attorneys			1
new legislation went into effect in 2010			0
" many exonerations of prisoners on death row and elsewhere have happened because prosecutors failed to disclose important evidence to the defense , " said @entity0 legal analyst @entity247			1
" open discovery would prevent those problems from happening and preserve the chance for a fair trial in the first place			0
" the @entity259 lists 14 states as having the " least discovery in the nation			0
" they are @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277			0
but there may be a dark side to open discovery laws			0
criminals might use the information from prosecutors to learn the identities of their accusers , and then intimidate them before they testify			2
in @entity288 , @entity287 district attorney @entity286 supports open discovery laws while admitting their drawbacks			0
@entity286 , a member of the @entity291 board of directors and a former member of the @entity295 's criminal justice @entity293 , sometimes asks judges to allow blacking out — or redacting — of personal information contained in disclosed files			0
but redacting personal data , such as witness addresses , can cause problems , too , @entity286 said			0
what if an attorney needs an address to track down a witness for a pretrial interview or to run a background check ? in that case , he said , the attorney is out of luck			2
in @entity3 , @entity85 " was the poster child case for open discovery , " said @entity1			1
such laws , he said , would force prosecutors to focus less on winning and losing			2
" the issue is not about winning — but about truth - seeking and justice , " @entity1 said			2
" open discovery should be the norm in every case , everywhere			2
" @entity286 has a less idealistic point of view			0
" not to disparage defense attorneys , " he said , but a defense attorney 's " job is not to seek the truth			0
their job is to seek the acquittal of their client			0
" @entity286 asked : what should defense attorneys say if their clients want to read those unrestricted reports ? " we have in our possession , often , information that can be really badly misused			0
" according to a @entity193 opinion , if @entity85 's defense attorneys had gained access to the prosecution 's case files during trial , they could have demonstrated enough reasonable doubt to win an acquittal			1
instead , @entity85 served two decades in prison under a death sentence			1
@entity1 remembered a day in january 2012 when he watched @entity85 clear his final hurdle			1
a judge had already dismissed all charges against @entity85			2
all that was left was waiting to learn whether the @entity42 @entity219 would hear the state 's appeal			0
@entity1 and @entity85 sat together , ready to live blog their news from an open laptop			1
finally , the highest court in the land announced its decision : the justices refused to consider the state 's appeal			0
" ' it 's over			0
it is over , @entity85 , " @entity1 remembered saying			1
" there is no more appeal , there is no other place to take this			0
there 's no place they can go			0
" " that , " @entity1 said , " was a great day			2
" should more states require prosecutors to share all case files with defense attorneys ? what do you think ? share your thoughts in the comments .			1

@entity1 -- a priest , nurse and lawyer -- finds evidence in @entity3 death row case
@entity85 sat on death row for years before evidence overturned his conviction
case poses big questions about requiring prosecutors to share evidence
