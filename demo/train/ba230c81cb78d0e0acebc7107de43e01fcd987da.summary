-- traveling with young children is an imperfect art. sure , there are urban myths about parents who tour @entity6 with their silent , serene baby in an organic backpack			0
but that 's just folklore peddled by luxury retailers selling couture children 's clothing			0
real kids are loud , smelly and fidgety			2
traveling only ups the ante			0
exhibit a : the @entity19 brood traipsing through an airport			0
if that glamorous couple ca n't mask the hot mess of family travel , what hope is there for the rest of us ? maybe the answer lies in embracing the messiness			1
it 's what the @entity31 call ' wabi sabi , ' a perspective that celebrates the imperfect , the impermanent and the incomplete			0
it 's an apt metaphor for modern @entity36 family life , especially when you 're planning spring break on the road with young children			2
regardless of your destination , there are three critical factors that help soften the sometimes harsh realities of spending quality family time together			2
the " @entity58 " virtually guarantee a good time for the little ones and relative peace of mind for parents : a hotel with an indoor pool , free breakfast with a do - it - yourself waffle maker and access to @entity57 cartoons			2
when stripped to these bare essentials , family vacationing morphs from the frenzy of plotting the perfect escape to enjoying a simpler and more satisfying adventure			2
who says you ca n't create your best family memories over free food and drink at a hotel happy hour ? just consider the $ 100 tab to feed a family of four at a big - name amusement park and the beauty of a ' wabi sabi ' vacation comes into clearer focus			1
the next step to a more mindful -- not to mention budget friendly -- family trip is to look local			1
here in the @entity80 , @entity79 reigns supreme , but there are other regional gems worth a second look			0
two to consider are @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 , @entity87			1
@entity84 , @entity85 @entity88 nicknamed the scenic city , @entity84 , @entity85 , lives up to its billing			1
perched invitingly on the banks of the @entity93 , the city offers abundant natural attractions , including whitewater rafting , hiking and hang gliding			0
more surprising , perhaps , is @entity84 's rich cultural scene , including the @entity99 and the historic @entity100			1
with literally dozens of attractions packed along the city 's downtown riverfront alone , it 's little wonder @entity84 was named one of the country 's top places to travel in 2012 by @entity109			1
narrowing down the list of family - friendly attractions can be difficult			1
here 's a kid - centered cheat sheet to help : where to go creative @entity114			2
this three - story , hands - on museum will delight young children			2
fronted by a 2 Â½ story river - play area , complete with ceiling - high climbing structures , working water cannons and a lock - and - dam system , the museum also houses a series of interactive art , music and theater exhibits			2
there 's also an inventor 's clubhouse for aspiring engineers and an excavation station for digging up dinosaur bones			0
somehow , aquariums just seem better in cities defined by their proximity to water ( sorry , @entity140 ) , and so it is with @entity84 's @entity135			1
sure , the kids will love the ocean - themed wing of this double - sided attraction , with its friendly penguins and imposing sharks , but the river - side exhibit is a wonder , too			1
giant catfish , river otters and alligators roam the exhibits , offering plenty of opportunities to get lost in the dimly lit corridors of the freshwater building			0
no matter where you start , there are plenty of spots to dip little fingers in icy water and delight in the slimy creatures that swim by			0
modern childhood is a torrent of gadgetry and engrossing virtual reality , but at @entity166 there are no electronic escapes , there 's something better : marvel - worthy natural wonders			2
traveling from @entity177 on a recent @entity79 - bound trip , @entity176 , 32 , was eager to see what he 'd heard described as one of the " 100 things to see before you die			1
" " it did n't disappoint , " @entity176 said			0
( his 11 - year - old son @entity184 agreed , although he was n't willing to rate it better than the @entity186			2
still , points for @entity187 ! ) situated 1,120 feet below the surface of @entity189 ( think of an inverted empire state building and you get a sense of the depth ) , @entity166 is actually a series of caves leading to a stunning 145 - foot waterfall named after the wife of @entity198 , the chemist and cave enthusiast who made the original 17 - hour round - trip trek ( mostly wriggling on his stomach ) to view the falls			1
today , it 's an easy round - trip walk ( less than a mile , upright )			1
one caveat : there are no strollers allowed so be prepared to carry younger kids or distract them by throwing pennies into the countless underground pools along the guided path			0
family - friendly restaurants when to go during march and april the city plays host to a spring break safari , with special behind - the - scenes tours such as the keeper kids program at the @entity135 and the junior explorer 's scavenger hunt at @entity222 gardens			1
many local hotels , including the @entity224 and the @entity225 , offer spring break promotions that include bundled room and attraction rates through april			0
in june , families can head to the banks of the @entity93 for @entity84 's nine - day @entity232 music festival			1
featuring five stages with more than 100 bands , the festival also has a children 's village , interactive exhibits and marketplace			0
this year 's headliners include @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243			0
general admission is $ 40 ; kids 10 and under are free			0
@entity86 , @entity87 @entity86 is worth the ride what 's more southern than @entity249 rocket scientists and the smell of frying wiener schnitzel ? in @entity86 , @entity87 , the answer 's not much			1
known as rocket city , modern @entity86 retains its antebellum aura ( the @entity255 even named it one of @entity36 's " distinctive destinations " ) , but the city 's skyline is defined by the @entity260 rockets developed there in the 1960s			1
led by @entity266 and his team of @entity249 rocket scientists ( spirited into the @entity36 after @entity269 through a covert @entity271 effort codenamed " operation paper clip " ) , this team of former @entity265 - allied scientists paved the way for modern @entity36 space flight			1
today , their legacy can be felt everywhere from the city 's convention center ( named the @entity278 ) to the @entity279 , which @entity278 helped establish			0
if you 're lucky , museum volunteer dr. @entity281 , an original member of @entity278 's team , will be on hand to provide a firsthand account of the heady days of @entity36 's race to the moon			0
the centerpiece of this sprawling space oasis is the 68,000 - square - foot @entity291 , housing an original @entity260 rocket , an @entity294 cockpit trainer and a 67 - foot curved - screen imax theater featuring five daily showings			1
outside , kids can explore numerous rockets up close ; experience a simulated space launch ( for those under 54 inches , there 's a mini-version in the cosmos play area ) ; and stomp around a faux lunar crater			1
if you 're planning to make a day of it , pack a lunch and picnic in space shuttle park			0
the perfect follow - up ? a week spent at the center 's famous space camp			1
this charming , mid-sized children 's museum welcomes visitors under a canopy of 8,000 fabric leaves that comprise a sprawling imitation evergreen in the museum 's atrium			0
inside , this hands - on learning space is packed with fun features , including a replica blasting exhibit ( complete with dry ice ) that teaches kids about local mining history ; a 19th - century general store ; and a special space for infants and young children to safely explore			1
if you have extra energy , the @entity333 is across the street , and kids 6 and under are free			0
located just a mile from the @entity279 , this 100 - acre natural retreat is a world away from the high - tech wonders of aerospace engineering			0
kids will enjoy the two - acre children 's garden and mini-railroad			2
( the open - air @entity348 shopping center is also nearby and has a kids ' carousel and gondola rides			2
) kid - friendly eateries when to go summer in the south can be brutal , so it 's better to go during the explosion of color that defines @entity358 in the springtime			1
during april , the @entity338 hosts its annual festival of flowers with thousands of blooming dogwoods and azaleas on display , with average temperatures topping out at just 75 degrees			0
another spring standout in @entity86 is the 19th annual @entity367 , april 13 - 14 , at the @entity368 and @entity369			1
the race pits high school students from around the world against one another in a feat of engineering to see who has the math and science skills to reach the finish line first			0
no matter where you 're headed this spring break , if you go there in the spirit of wabi sabi family fun you 're guaranteed to find unexpected delights			0
