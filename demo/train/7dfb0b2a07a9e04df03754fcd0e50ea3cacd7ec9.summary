-- traditionally , hotels are built with the hope they 'll have staying power			1
for a new breed of accommodation , however , long - term is passe			1
the last two years has seen a proliferation in the number of pop - up hotels -- housed in anything from tepees to old shipping containers			1
many are making their way in places traditionally off - limits for traditional hotels			1
@entity19 , the founder of the @entity21 - based the @entity20 , has set up accommodation in the form of luxury tents ( and in some cases yurts , shepherd huts and @entity28 mobile homes ) at some of @entity31 's most spectacular properties			1
in august , for example , he 's partnering with @entity31 and moving his operation on the grounds of the @entity35 , a sprawling 19th century manor that was built as a summer residence for @entity37 and @entity38			2
" as lovely as conventional hotels can be , they are effectively a series of boxes stacked on top of each other , insulating guests from the environment			1
i wanted to throw this whole concept up into the air and see how it fell , " he says			0
" i wanted to create a hotel that could really connect with the environment where it was positioned			1
" infographic : the price of business travel the @entity56 is also popular on the festival circuit			0
in fact , the first one launched at @entity60 , the @entity21 's largest music festival , two years ago			1
then , it only offered 20 rooms			0
this year , its rolled out 130 , and was fully booked			0
" guests seem to really appreciate that if you were to come and stay with us again in a different location , it would be a different holiday experience , " he says			0
booking is n't necessarily cheap -- tents at the four - day @entity60 start at $ 1,525			2
at the same time , just because the walls are canvas does n't mean you 'd be roughing it			0
concierge and porter service is usually part of the package and , depending on the event , there are usually accompanying restaurant , bar and spa tents			0
the concept is gaining traction			0
@entity87 is another company that offers portable accommodation , often pegged to major events , such as the @entity91 last year and the @entity92 in @entity93 in june this year			2
@entity87 's rooms are set up in shipping containers , making them easy to transport			2
that they 're self - contained means they have climate control options , an advantage over the @entity56			2
@entity102 's high - speed trains attract frustrated fliers one of the most inventive pop - up concepts , however , has n't been officially launched yet			1
it is the brainchild of @entity107 - based architecture firm @entity106 , and last month it won the @entity108 in @entity109			1
the company is hoping to simultaneously address two pressing issues plaguing many urban landscapes : vacated office space and insufficient hotel vacancies			1
the collective , which is made up of partners @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , is hoping to make @entity120 its launching point			1
@entity117 points out that the office vacancy rate in the city is alarmingly high at 26 %			2
" tenants would rather wait for new high rises to be built than rent the ones leftover from the ' 60s and ' 70s , which , unfortunately , the city has a lot of , " he explains			0
" the ceilings are low and the stock seems outdated to potential tenants			0
" meanwhile , @entity120 's hotel occupancy rate is at 96 % -- almost full capacity			1
@entity106 's solution is to create temporary hotels in empty office buildings			1
that way , tourists get a place to sleep for the night and the building owner can finally pull in some rent			0
watch : reinventing the hotel breakfast an entire hotel could fit into 36 boxes , enough to fill a single lorry			2
when unpacked , they would contain all the makings of a modern hotel room , including beds , sofas , toilets , partitions , plus elements to craft night clubs , restaurants -- even a pool , if requested			2
" a traditional hotel can take five to six years to build , from start to finish			1
with the pop - up hotel , we see it taking two to four weeks , " says @entity117			1
the beauty of the project , says @entity118 , is its flexibility			0
" if you were to set up in @entity168 , you could bring indoor swimming pools			2
in @entity171 , guests might want to watch a boxing match			0
we could bring in a temporary boxing ring			0
it all depends on the city and the public , " he says			0
the price point , they 're imagining , would also be considerably lower			0
the average @entity120 hotel room is $ 350 a night			1
@entity106 's rooms , meanwhile , would clock in around $ 130			0
the company is currently scoping out partners to make the concept a reality			0
the way @entity106 sees it , the hotel could be a savvy marketing stunt for the right brand			2
for example , says @entity117 , a major fashion label could use the @entity106 model to promote itself during fashion week			0
" there 's no reason you could n't have the @entity200 pop - up , or the @entity202 pop - up , " he says .			1

the last two years have seen an increase in pop - up hotel *chains*
unlike traditional hotels , these can set up at festivals and special events
