-- tensions magnified among the world 's top three economies over @entity5 's controversial new air defense zone			1
the issues range from disagreements on air space as well as disputed islands between @entity5 and @entity10			1
on saturday , @entity5 declared the creation of an air defense identification zone in the @entity13 , eliciting strong criticisms from the @entity15 and its close ally , @entity10			1
both countries refuse to recognize @entity5 's newly created zone			1
what is @entity5 's " @entity20 " ? @entity5 released a map and coordinates that identify its air defense zone on november 23			1
it declared that aircraft in the area must report their flight plans to @entity5 , maintain two - way radio and clearly mark their nationalities on the aircraft			2
the new rules went into effect 10 a.m. that day , @entity32 reported			0
this space included a swath of the @entity13 , including a disputed island chain known as @entity38 in @entity5 and @entity39 in @entity10			1
@entity5 vowed to " adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions			2
" what is an " @entity20 " or @entity20 ? the @entity20 is not a new concept			0
it 's essentially a buffer zone outside a country 's sovereign airspace			2
several countries including the @entity15 and @entity10 have established @entity20 in international airspace next to their nations			2
a foreign aircraft traveling in an @entity20 can be required to identify itself for entry into that country 's airspace			0
it is unilaterally imposed , so it does n't really have a legal basis and is n't based on negotiation with neighbors , said @entity62 , the @entity63 editor of @entity64			0
" it 's purpose is to give the country an early warning zone in which it can intercept potentially unfriendly aircraft			2
" what islands does @entity5 's @entity20 affect ? the @entity5 defense ministry said the new air defense zone was not directed toward a specific country			1
the map and coordinates released by @entity5 show the zone covers parts of the @entity13 , as well as the @entity38 / @entity39 islands			1
@entity10 and @entity5 both lay claims on @entity38 / @entity39 islands			1
and @entity5 's new zone overlaps with @entity10 's , which was formed on august 29 , 1968			1
@entity5 contests the @entity10 air defense zone as illegal , @entity83 , who is with the @entity84 , told @entity32			1
@entity5 also has stirred its @entity87 neighbors			0
a reef called @entity89 in the @entity90 sits about 149 kilometers southwest of @entity87 and 287 kilometers east from @entity5 , and is partially covered by the @entity5 adiz			0
the @entity91 have established an @entity92 on @entity89			0
how have @entity5 's neighbors reacted ? @entity10 on sunday slammed the @entity5 announcement , saying it had " no validity whatsoever			1
" the nation 's minister for foreign affairs called @entity5 's measure " profoundly dangerous acts that unilaterally change the status quo in the @entity13 , escalating the situation , and that may cause unintended consequences			1
" opinion : did @entity5 make strategic error with air zone ? in @entity87 , the nation 's defense ministry spokesman , @entity107 said the country 's jurisdiction over @entity89 remains unchanged			1
" @entity5 has unilaterally set up its @entity20 , " @entity107 said			0
he said it overlaps with @entity87 's jurisdiction			0
the @entity87 government would fly over such areas without informing the @entity5 side , he added			0
sounds like an @entity118 conflict , so why is the @entity15 involved ? the @entity15 interprets the @entity20 differently than @entity5			2
as stated in @entity32 , @entity5 's new aircraft identification rules do n't distinguish between aircraft flying through the zone with no intention of flying into @entity5 's airspace and those that do , the @entity119 points out			1
this is not how the @entity15 interprets the @entity20 , as stated by @entity15 secretary of state @entity127 's on november 23 : " the @entity15 does not apply its @entity20 procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter @entity15 national airspace			2
we urge @entity5 not to implement its threat to take action against aircraft that do not identify themselves or obey orders from @entity137			0
" the @entity15 has said it wo n't recognize the zone -- nor @entity5 's call that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans			1
" freedom of overflight and other internationally lawful uses of sea and airspace are essential to prosperity , stability , and security in the @entity151			0
we do n't support efforts by any @entity153 to apply its @entity20 procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter its national airspace			0
" to the @entity15 , the newly formed air zone becomes more than an island dispute between @entity5 and its longtime ally , @entity10 , but a controversy over international airspace			1
" the @entity15 is very concerned with freedom of navigation , whether that be sea or sky , " said @entity161 , @entity118 managing editor of @entity162 , an aviation and aerospace industries news site			0
what are countries doing in response to the new zone ? after the @entity15 thoroughly expressed its displeasure with @entity5 's @entity20 , two @entity15 military aircraft flew into the newly claimed air defense zone without notifying @entity5			1
the flight came just two days after @entity5 's announcement of its new zone			1
meanwhile , a flurry of strong words have been exchanged amongst various countries			0
the @entity15 ' warning that the zone heightens the risk of " misunderstanding and miscalculation " drew a sharp @entity5 rebuke , calling the @entity15 remarks " irresponsible			1
" @entity15 : @entity5 claim of air rights over disputed islands ' creates risk of incident ' in an editorial in state - run media @entity32 , one commentary writer denounced the @entity15 and @entity10 objections as a case of " they can do it while @entity5 can not , " referring to the countries ' existing @entity20			1
@entity5 slams ' inappropriate ' @entity15 remarks on territorial dispute with @entity10 @entity87 and @entity5 defense officials are expected to hold talks this week regarding the overlapping @entity20 that includes @entity89			1
are commercial flights affected in @entity5 's new air defense zone ? as defined by @entity5 's announcement , the air defense zone 's requirements appear to apply to all aircraft			1
such planes are probably not required from a legal perspective to notify @entity5 , but it might be a good idea from a safety perspective , said @entity218			0
in the meantime , @entity10 airliners , @entity219 ( @entity219 ) and @entity220 ( @entity220 ) announced wednesday they would not submit flight plans for their flights through the affected areas			0
back to the islands -- why have @entity39 / @entity39 islands been so contentious ? @entity5 says its claim on the islands extend back to 1400s , which was used as a staging point for @entity5 fisherman			2
@entity10 says it saw no trace of @entity5 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity10 sovereign territory in 1895			2
@entity10 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers			0
the @entity10 surrender at the end of @entity244 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further			0
the islands were administered by the @entity15 occupation force after the war			0
but in 1972 , @entity249 returned them to @entity10 as part of its withdrawal from @entity253			0
according to @entity32 , @entity5 and @entity10 " agreed in 1978 to put the issue aside and solve it in the future			2
" the dispute intensified last year as protests erupted in @entity5 after @entity10 announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private @entity10 owners			2
anti-japanese demonstrations turned violent as protesters hurled bottles at the @entity10 embassy in @entity137 , overturned @entity10 cars , ransacked @entity10 stores and restaurants			0
what 's so appealing about the @entity39 ? it 's uninhabited and may look like a bunch of rocks			2
but ownership of the islands would allow for exclusive oil , mineral , and fishing rights in surrounding waters			0
@entity0 's @entity277 in @entity249 , @entity278 in @entity279 , @entity280 in @entity281 and @entity282 in @entity283 contributed to this report .			0
