-- another day , another toll in @entity3 's civil war : 213 dead			1
for many around the world , the story of the fighting in @entity3 is a near daily listing of casualty figures that represent the devastation of war			1
for those on the ground , it 's the reality of nearly two years of fighting with no end in sight			2
it 's that reality the country 's principal opposition group says led it to suspend its participation in next week 's meeting in @entity22 -- an international conference of diplomats from more than 60 nations working to bring about an end to the violence			1
the whole world is not doing anything , " @entity28 , a member of the @entity29 , told @entity0 on friday			1
" we are not going to any more conferences			2
" in a statement released friday , the coalition said it also would not accept upcoming invitations to meetings in @entity38 and @entity39			2
what 's next ? the war in @entity3 began in march 2011 when president @entity43 's government brutally cracked down on protesters , partly inspired by @entity46 uprisings in the region , calling for political freedoms			1
the protest movement quickly devolved into an armed conflict along somewhat sectarian lines between majority @entity52 and @entity43 's minority - @entity55 dominated government			1
alawites are an offshoot of @entity58			2
world leaders have been hard pressed to end the fighting with the @entity61 hopelessly deadlocked amid concern the violence could spill over into neighboring countries and destabilize the region			1
the @entity66 , the @entity67 and the @entity68 -- the backbone of the @entity70 -- have supplied aid to rebels in the form of communications equipment and humanitarian aid			0
the rebels want more , specifically military aid in the form of arms and training			0
" we want the @entity66 to help the people on the ground , " @entity28 said			0
but countries have stopped short of providing military aid as many did to @entity87 rebels over concerns about the unity of the fractious @entity3 opposition			1
concerns also have been raised about rebel ties to an @entity93 affiliate , the @entity94 , and other militant groups			0
counterproductive move ? the news that the @entity29 was pulling out of the meeting came as a surprise to the @entity66 where at least one senior @entity66 official warned the move would be counterproductive			1
the meeting will provide the opposition its first opportunity to meet with new @entity66 secretary of state @entity105 , according to the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
the coalition did not notify the @entity66 ahead of its decision , said the official , who was not authorized to release the information			0
@entity111 urged the coalition to reconsider its move			0
" it is important to have @entity29 participation , and we strongly urge members to help win the arguments for achieving more support for the @entity120			0
the @entity29 is making progress ; it is not easy , but now is not the time to give up , " the @entity121 said in a statement			0
the @entity29 , meanwhile , is pushing ahead with plans to create a transitional government despite @entity43 's refusal to cede power			0
a head of the interim government will be named within 10 days , according to a statement released friday by the group at the conclusion of a two - day meeting in @entity135			1
see - saw battles the announcement by the coalition comes as see - saw battles between government forces and rebels have reached a near draw in the civil war , with neither side gaining ground in recent months			0
the fighting has spilled from the countryside into city centers , with rebels and government forces reportedly clashing in the capital city of @entity151 as well the country 's largest city of @entity154			0
the opposition @entity155 said 213 people killed in fighting across the country friday			1
of the casualties , 92 were killed in the opposition stronghold of @entity154 , according to the group			2
@entity0 can not confirm casualties as access to the country has been severely restricted			0
the deaths in @entity154 , according to the opposition , occurred when scud missiles were fired friday by government forces at rebel strongholds in predominantly residential neighborhoods			2
the missile attack came a day after a series of car bombs targeted government buildings in the capital city of @entity151 , including the headquarters of @entity43 's ruling party , and left at least 53 people dead and more than 230 wounded			0
the @entity178 recently estimated 70,000 people died in the fighting in @entity3			1
@entity0 's @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			0

" the whole world is not doing anything , " a @entity3 opposition member says
the opposition says it is *boycotting* the friends of @entity3 as a sign of protest
