-- for the third time this year , following strong openings from " @entity2 " and " @entity3 , " a movie with a tough female protagonist topped the box office in a major way			1
@entity11 - @entity10 's @entity9 was right on target in its debut weekend , opening to $ 66.7 million â € ” the fifth - best debut ever for a @entity10 film , and a faster start than last year 's @entity18 , which opened with $ 66.1 million			1
@entity9 continued @entity10 's streak of number one debuts , as all 13 of the studio 's releases have reached the peak position during their first weekend of wide release			1
" girls kick butt , " says @entity26 , @entity11 's evp of distribution , about the rise of the female action protagonist at the 2012 box office			1
still , he believes that gender had less to do with @entity9 's successful opening weekend than audiences ' trust in @entity10			1
" there 's a universal love of this brand , " he says , praising their " consistency [ as ] classic storytellers			2
" @entity11 wisely marketed the film differently to boys and girls â € ” much like the studio did when releasing another princess film , tangled , in 2010			1
for that film , @entity11 created a campaign that focused as much on @entity50 's humorous male character , @entity49 , as it did on the film 's main character , @entity50			1
for @entity9 , @entity11 targeted males with ads that emphasized the film 's rambunctious @entity56 hijinks and mischievous red - headed triplets			1
meanwhile , girls were targeted with ads that focused more on @entity9 's central character , @entity62 , and her quest to change her fate			1
still , @entity26 notes that there were numerous images that spoke to both males and females , such as shots of @entity62 riding her horse through the woods			2
despite rather tepid reviews ( compared to the rest of @entity10 's catalog ) , the $ 185 million @entity56 adventure earned an " a " @entity78 grade from audiences , which were 57 percent female and 43 percent male			2
thanks to good word - of - mouth , @entity9 will likely enjoy small declines over the ensuing weeks ( although it will face direct competition when @entity87 debuts on july 13 ) , and if history is any indication , finish somewhere in the $ 200 million range			2
in second place , @entity91 3 : @entity94 's @entity93 dropped 41 percent to $ 20.2 million , giving @entity96 ' $ 145 million animated sequel a $ 157.6 million total after three weekends			1
the 1 - 2 finish of @entity9 and @entity91 3 marks just the third time in the past decade that two animated films have taken up the top two spots at the box office			1
in november 2007 , @entity103 and @entity104 finished in first and second			2
in november 2004 , @entity105 and @entity106 did the same			0
@entity107 , @entity91 3 has already stampeded to $ 208.4 million			1
interestingly , despite its @entity94 setting , the film has yet to open in the @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 ( as well as @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115 )			0
@entity116 does n't want to let @entity91 get overshadowed by the @entity117 , which is currently diverting @entity94 's attention , or the upcoming @entity119 in @entity120			1
@entity122 's $ 69 million revisionist horror film @entity123 : @entity124 earned a decidedly un-presidential $ 16.5 million in its debut frame			0
the r - rated film , an adaptation of @entity129 's popular novel of the same name , drew crowds that were 56 percent male and 53 percent above the age of 25 , according to @entity122			0
audiences were n't especially pleased with the film itself , issuing @entity137 a harsh " c + " cinemascore grade			0
@entity124 's box office performance somewhat resembles the performance of @entity141 , which earned $ 13.8 million in its 2006 debut			1
both efforts earned innumerable headlines for their absurdly straightforward , silly titles , but that early buzz did n't translate into substantial box office dollars			1
audiences ' interest peaked with the gimmicky title and concept , but they were n't actually invested in the film			0
@entity154 finished in fourth place in its third weekend , falling 52 percent to $ 10 million million			1
@entity158 's $ 130 million @entity157 prequel has earned $ 108.6 million domestically , and it will likely fall just short of matching its production budget domestically			0
fortunately for @entity122 , the film has zapped up over $ 150 million internationally			0
just like the film in first place , the film in fifth place , @entity3 , is centered on a warrior princess			0
the @entity168 / @entity167 collaboration earned another $ 8 million over the weekend , a drop of 40 percent			2
the $ 170 million picture has now grossed $ 137.1 million domestically , and another $ 160.4 million million overseas			0
notably , @entity172 ' @entity171 also earned an estimated $ 8 million this weekend , so the two films may flip - flop when actuals come out on monday afternoon			2
it was the end of the world for @entity179 ' @entity178 , which started its run way back in tenth place with only $ 3.8 million out of 1,625 theaters			0
the romantic dramedy , which stars @entity185 and @entity186 , was almost beaten by @entity179 ' other current release , @entity187 , which , in its fifth weekend , found $ 3.4 million out of just 395 theaters			2
fortunately , @entity179 says that seeking a friend , which earned a weak " @entity191 grade , cost less than $ 10 million			0
in limited release , midnight in @entity194 director @entity193 's latest film , to @entity195 , got off to a blazing start with $ 379,000 out of just 5 theaters , which yielded a remarkable $ 75,800 per theater average			0
the iconic director may have another @entity94 - set hit on his hands			0
brave -- $ 66.7 million 2			2
@entity91 3 : @entity94 's @entity93 -- $ 20.2 million 3			1
@entity123 : @entity124 -- $ 16.5 million 4			0
@entity154 -- $ 10.0 million 5			0
@entity3 -- $ 8.0 million see full story at @entity0			0
