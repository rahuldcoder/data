new @entity2 government could be announced monday news reports out of @entity13 say a man set himself on fire monday in front of the presidential palace			1

" @entity13 media said @entity50 started a @entity52 group called " stop the corruption and tyranny in @entity13			1
" in a statement on the page , @entity50 wrote , " is n't it the time for the @entity13 people to choose their freedom ? " " the @entity68 world 's horrific new trend : self - immolation , " wrote @entity64 of the foreignpolicy.com blog on monday			1

at @entity139 's @entity138 in 2001 , five people lit themselves on fire in front of a @entity0 crew			0
a police report identified them as members of the banned @entity148 movement			0
