@entity0 -- despite revelations in a congressional investigation of a subsidiary 's mismanagement and questionable vetting of employees , the company formerly known as @entity3 could soon win millions of dollars in new job orders for work in @entity12			1
a subsidiary of @entity3 , the new name for @entity3 , is eligible to win @entity15 work worth tens of millions of dollars to train @entity12 police , according to a @entity15 official			1
five companies were qualified to bid on the training and training - support contracts , including @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25			2
@entity25 is a subsidiary company owned by @entity3			1
the @entity15 contract is to be announced next month			0
@entity3 has not been officially notified whether it will be awarded the contract , according to a company spokesman			1
" we have not been awarded either and have no knowledge of the status of those contracts , " said @entity3 spokesman @entity29			1
an industry official told @entity1 that @entity3 made bids on two task orders under the training program , one for the actual training of @entity12 police and one for logistics support for such training			1
once awarded , the new orders would be in effect until august 2012 , according to a @entity15 statement			0
since 2007 , the company , then called @entity3 , has held the rights to bid against the other four companies on a pool of jobs worth as much as $ 15 billion			1
@entity3 still holds numerous contracts under three company names in @entity12 for support of military and intelligence operations			1
those companies are @entity56 , @entity3 and @entity57			2
the company has a troubled past both in @entity60 and @entity12			1
it was banned from operating in @entity60 by the government there after a shooting incident left @entity60 civilians dead and injured			2
that incident strained relations between the @entity68 and @entity60			2
in may 2009 , four contractors in @entity70 were involved in a shooting incident that left two @entity12 civilians dead			2
two of the contractors are now facing charges in the @entity68			0
a congressional investigation found evidence that the company that hired them , a @entity3 subsidiary called @entity3 , armed the employees despite having no permission to do so from the @entity68 military			1
the probe also found that the company illicitly obtained the guns used in the shooting , and hundreds of others , from a stockpile of weapons meant for the use of the @entity12 military and police			1
on wednesday @entity3 officials were called before the @entity95 to discuss that shooting incident			0
the committee 's chairman , @entity97 , @entity99 , said an @entity101 investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had " violated alcohol consumption policies , were not authorized to possess weapons , violated use - of - force rules and violated movement - control policies			0
" he said one of the keys to beating the @entity109 in @entity12 is the ability of @entity68 forces to win support from the @entity12 people , many of whom do not distinguish between @entity68 contractors and the @entity68 military			0
@entity3 vice president @entity117 acknowledged the company 's culpability in the 2009 incident in his opening statement to the panel			2
in the statement , @entity117 said , " the new @entity3 would act differently today			0
we simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon ( where needed ) and without full compliance with all requirements			0
" he said the company has " put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept			0
" on thursday , @entity15 spokesman @entity136 defended the military 's oversight of contractors			0
" we 've made a lot of mistakes in both @entity60 and @entity12			1
and we 've tried to address those mistakes in a number of ways , " @entity136 said			0
" but as far as i know , people are being held to account for the mistakes and the violations that they have made			0
