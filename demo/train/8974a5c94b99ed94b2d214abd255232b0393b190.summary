@entity4 , @entity5 -- " facts are stubborn things ; and whatever may be our wishes , our inclinations , or the dictates of our passion , they can not alter the state of facts and evidence			2
" -- @entity15 , ' argument in @entity17 in the @entity18 ' , december 1770			0
at the heart of the maelstrom that has gripped @entity21 during the past eight weeks since i authored an opinion piece on the nuclear - armed nation 's alleged intelligence sector malfeasance against @entity27 regional interests lies nothing less than the struggle to define @entity21 's modern statehood			1
it is a fight between the feudal politics of @entity21 's barons , president @entity34 being chief among them , and the military 's dominance of its industry , security and strategic sectors			1
stuck in the middle is a largely uneducated , underemployed and malnourished population that yearns for leadership -- any kind of leadership -- to guide the country forward			0
that struggle , hidden from the world 's view through the many years of dictatorship and moribund civilian rule , has now come out in the open as a result of my column 's disclosure of a confidential memorandum that @entity21 's then ambassador to the @entity27 , @entity59 , directed me to draft and deliver to admiral @entity60 , then chairman of the @entity61			1
[ @entity63 's note : @entity59 has denied any involvement in the memo			1
] inadvertent as my purpose was in disclosing the memorandum , the debate it has touched off is real and the issues being debated are finally the ones that need illumination in a country that survives on a rich diet of conspiracy theories and the adolescent antics of its political leaders			1
the memorandum called on @entity60 to dissuade his friend , @entity21 's army chief gen. @entity78 , from moving against the civilian government in the tense days that followed @entity81 -- the @entity82 raid that killed @entity83			1
in return , it offered a commitment by a reconstituted civilian government , which would have added national security muscle previously belonging to the army and intelligence sectors , to do a lot of what @entity27 and its allies in the region , @entity92 and @entity93 , have long been calling on @entity21 to do			1
to some in @entity21 , the memo was the product of an honorable civil servant ( @entity59 ) attempting to save his boss 's government from imminent demise at the hands of military men he had come to despise			1
to others , the memorandum 's contents were nothing short of high treason , the product of a ruthless operator 's ( @entity34 ) directive and his cunning collaborator 's ( @entity59 ) compliance			2
the truth probably lies somewhere in between			0
yet far from harming the democratic institutions @entity59 claimed to be defending when he first contacted me on that beautiful may morning , the debate over the memorandum 's who , what , when and why has had the remarkable effect of stimulating forces that make democracy real in a civilized society , not the mirage that was being peddled around the halls of @entity131 , @entity121 's think - tank lecture circuit or the sunday talk shows by the able ambassador			1
today , nearly two months after the memorandum 's contents became known , the army remains in its barracks			0
the intelligence services continue to play their @entity139 in @entity93 while minding the store at home with an invisible hand			0
@entity34 , who said he would address a special joint session of @entity144 on " memogate " sometime next week , had his heart condition resurface on tuesday , sending him scurrying off to @entity147 ( @entity21 doctors and hospitals would n't do ) for a stay of undetermined length outside the country			1
the @entity153 has taken on the challenge addressed to it by a leader of an opposition political party who felt he could n't get the " memogate " truth out of a biased parliamentary committee			0
an @entity160 has been formed as a result			0
a former cricket hero turned politician now routinely attracts tens of thousands of supporters at gathering points around the country as he tries to coerce the @entity168 's winds to blow further east			0
and the chivalrous prime minister , @entity170 , tells his party loyalists that he is prepared to resign if my facts are proven right and @entity59 , or worse , @entity34 , are found to be the minds behind the memo			1
@entity21 's press is also doing its job well -- the hacks who support @entity180 are throwing knives at me hourly while those who want to see @entity34 get his comeuppance will simply not let the story go and are eagerly digging at and reporting on every facet of it			1
all of which means everyone -- finally -- has a stake in the outcome of an issue that could have brought serious repercussions to the country 's method of accountability and governance if the doctrine outlined in the memo had been enacted			1
hmmm ... ... seems to me that democracy is doing exactly what it should : self - corrective actions with heated debate about principled issues , all within the constitutional framework and rule of law as it exists today			2
@entity205 can call me all the names he wants -- it wo n't change the facts			0
it certainly will not deter me			0
and it wo n't help to fix what ails @entity21			2
@entity212 can ridicule my three or four claims that turned out to be inaccurate over a five year period of being interviewed nearly four or five times a week -- it wo n't change the facts , or the accuracy with which i recorded them in this instance			0
the think - tank crowd and my detractors at the @entity223 , never ones to like private @entity27 citizens running off and doing what they only talk about or dream of being able to do , have always pilloried my efforts -- but their frustrations and jealousies wo n't change the facts			1
even the @entity231 did n't have all the facts when it issued a denial of my opinion that @entity21 officials knew about the @entity83 raid before it happened			1
its fact checkers could not readily find the may 2 , 2011 story from @entity6 reporter @entity239 which reported that @entity21 's high commissioner to the @entity241 had said -- when asked about the @entity83 raid -- that @entity21 was " in the know of certain things " and " what happened happened with our consent			1
" [ @entity63 's note : @entity59 has been quoted as saying the allegation that he was informed of the raid in advance are " reckless , baseless and false			0
" ] i have largely ignored the attacks emanating from @entity59 's supporters in @entity121 because the former ambassador ca n't speak for himself since being put on ice by @entity34 in a safe house			2
@entity59 should be offered immunity from prosecution in @entity21 and simply tell the @entity21 people the truth about what he -- and his boss -- did			2
he will be seen as a hero for having the guts to call a spade a spade			0
rogue operations inside governments have no place in our world today			0
the people of @entity21 deserve better			2
they deserve to know the truth			0
and it is alone for the @entity21 people to decide whether their political leaders deserve their faith and trust after learning the truth of what has been done in their names			2
i did not ask to be involved in the events that gave rise to this firestorm			0
i too face threats and haranguing from @entity34 's supporters on a daily basis			0
but i had the courage to speak truth to power -- as i have done all my life -- and now i 'm going to make sure the facts of what the ambassador and those behind him asked me to do in the name of democracy are put squarely on the table for the people of @entity21 to see , judge and decide			1
facts , after all , are still stubborn things			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity302 .			2

@entity302 : my disclosure of confidential memo touched off debate in @entity21
@entity302 's opinion piece in the @entity309 led to resignation of @entity21 's ambassador to @entity27
he says the *discussion* of the nature of @entity21 democracy is good for that nation
@entity302 says an *inquiry* will bring to light the full facts of the matter
