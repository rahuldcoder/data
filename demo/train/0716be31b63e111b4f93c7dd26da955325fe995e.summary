-- when will this recession end ? i 'm not talking about the economic challenges facing our nation			0
i 'm talking about the severe downturn in the world of political comedy			1
by picking @entity10 as his running mate , @entity9 may have energized the @entity12			1
but is @entity10 all that exciting ? he 's a middle - aged , conservative white guy from the @entity13			1
as @entity15 's @entity14 aptly joked earlier this week on his late night show : " @entity9 is hoping to energize conservatives with his choice of @entity10 as running mate			1
that 's like trying to spice up a bowl of oatmeal with more oatmeal			1
" do n't get me wrong -- compared with @entity9 , @entity10 is @entity25 on crack			1
but even @entity27 labeled @entity10 as " the last @entity28			1
" translation : reliable but boring			1
the guy who makes politicians funny let me give you a little background about the plight of political comedy			1
when the nation found itself in an economic recession as president @entity39 was taking office , comedians headed into a comedic depression			2
@entity43 was comedy gold for eight years			1
if we knew how little material @entity39 would be providing us , comedians would have joined forces to repeal the @entity49 to enable @entity43 to be president for a third term			1
( i know that would 've been bad for the country , but we , comedians , are a particularly selfish breed -- after all , we wo n't even share the stage with other performers			2
) sure , there have been glimmers of a comedic recovery over the last few years			2
we perked up when @entity61 explored the possibility of running for president			1
her candidacy would have been the equivalent of a comedic stimulus package			0
who can forget rep. @entity68 , who famously posted photos of himself in his underwear on @entity71 ? this controversy harkened back to the comedy boom bestowed upon us by @entity76 's sex scandal			1
and recently , the @entity12 presidential debates offered some good stuff			0
most notably , @entity79 forgetting the name of the third government agency that he wanted to eliminate			0
to his credit , @entity39 has supplied some material , like when he said , " @entity84 is obviously an issue that has plagued the region for centuries			0
" or when @entity39 claimed he had traveled across the nation visiting our " 57 states			0
" i know many on the right see @entity39 as providing much more comedic material than comedians do			2
they often send me " jokes " about @entity39 on issues like @entity97 or the " @entity99 " program			0
while i appreciate the sentiment , here 's the cold , hard truth : conservatives are not funny			2
i 'm being brutally objective here			0
there are some funny conservative comedians and pundits , but how many can you name ? i have my theories why conservatives struggle so horribly when trying to be funny , but i 'll keep them to myself because i 'm not a mental health professional			2
in the midst of this comedy recession where we have witnessed a severe contraction in our @entity117 -- gross domestic laughter -- there is one potential goldmine that could use a bit more exploration			1
i 'm speaking of vice president @entity122			0
just search on @entity123 the words " @entity122 " and " gaffes " and watch your computer 's screen fill up with page after page of " @entity131			2
" a few months ago , while referring to @entity133 's famous comment to walk softly and a carry a big stick , @entity122 said : " i promise you , the president has a big stick			2
" and now , we have another " @entity122 moment " when he proclaimed that @entity9 's policies on regulating @entity140 would put , " y ' all back in chains			2
" oddly enough , @entity122 's blunders have not defined him as a comedic figure			0
at least when compared to say , former vice president @entity145 , who entertained us with gaffe after gaffe , from famously misspelling the word " potato " in front of a class of young students ( he added an " e " at the end ) to saying things like , " it 's wonderful to be here in the great state of @entity159			0
" there are upcoming events that offer some hope that we will emerge from the comedy doldrums			0
@entity165 will be attending the @entity166 scheduled later this month and has promised a " big surprise			0
" perhaps he will pay homage to @entity9 at the convention by tipping his hair to him			0
from @entity171 to @entity39 : 10 funny political lines and we comedians can all dream that at the upcoming @entity176 , @entity122 will throw away his script and just ad lib his speech			1
( i would predict that the @entity181 has standing orders to tackle @entity122 if he tries that			0
) even if these events could provide temporary relief , it 's unlikely that we will ever return to the political comedy golden years of @entity76 and @entity43			1
like many @entity188 , we 'll simply have to learn to make do with less			0
however , i have an idea that is motivated solely in helping the country and not my career			0
it may end the toxic political climate that is plaguing us			0
what about a bipartisan presidential ticket in 2016 : " @entity61 and @entity68 " ? think of the possibilities ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : there 's a severe downturn in the world of political comedy
@entity199 : @entity10 , a middle - aged white guy from the @entity13 , is " boring "
he says the golden years of political comedy were during the @entity76 and @entity43 eras
@entity199 : comedians can only dream about a ticket like : @entity61 and @entity68
