@entity0 had one stop to make before heading home to @entity3 to celebrate his daughters ' birthdays : a conference in @entity7 , @entity8			1
but when he landed in @entity7 , @entity0 , 40 , collapsed getting off the plane			1
he had been infected with @entity10 in @entity11 , where he worked as a top government official in the @entity11 @entity13			1
@entity0 was isolated at a local @entity8 hospital on july 20			1
he died five days later			2
@entity0 's wife @entity15 , lives in @entity16 , @entity3 , with the couple 's three young daughters , 5 - year - old @entity19 , 4 - year - old @entity20 , and @entity21 , who is 1			1
the @entity22 are naturalized citizens ; their daughters were born in the @entity24			1
" he was so proud when he became a @entity24 citizen , " @entity15 told @entity25			1
" he voted for first time in the last @entity24 presidential election			1
he lived in the @entity24 for many years , and wanted that for @entity11 -- a better democracy			1
" @entity0 had been caring for his @entity10 - stricken sister in @entity11 , @entity15 said , though at the time he did n't know she had @entity10			1
@entity0 is the first @entity24 to die in what health officials are calling the " deadliest @entity10 outbreak in history			1
" his death has sparked concerns that the virus could potentially spread to the @entity24			1
" people were n't really taking it [ @entity10 ] seriously until it hit @entity0 , " @entity15 said			1
" people are ready to take action			0
" let 's take a step back and look at what we know about the @entity10 outbreak : where is it happening ? up until this past week , the @entity10 outbreak had been contained to three @entity51 countries : @entity53 , where it began , @entity11 and @entity52			1
@entity0 is the first known case outside of these three countries			1
as of july 23 , the @entity57 had confirmed more than 800 @entity10 cases in the region , but suspects there have been many unreported infections and there may be more like 1,200 cases			1
@entity52 has been hardest hit with approximately 525 cases			0
how many people have died ? the @entity57 says as of july 23 , there have been 456 confirmed @entity10 deaths , and another 216 suspected deaths , bringing the number possibly to more than 670			1
the country of @entity53 has the most suspected deaths			0
the epidemic has been in that country longer			0
it is believed the epidemic began in the nation 's capital of @entity78			2
while international leaders have mobilized to fight the epidemic , it can be a difficult one to stop			0
it is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90 % of those who catch it			0
the death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60 % since it has been treated early in many instances			0
there is , however , no @entity10 vaccination			1
have other @entity24 been infected ? last week , two @entity24 aid workers in @entity11 's capital city , @entity94 , were confirmed to have the disease			1
doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected			2
it can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person 's bodily fluids			1
dr. @entity107 , a 33 - year - old @entity108 , @entity109 , resident , had been treating @entity10 patients in @entity94 when he started to feel sick			2
@entity107 works with @entity111 , a @entity112 international relief agency			0
he has been the medical director for the @entity113 in @entity94 and has been working to help @entity10 patients since october			2
after testing positive for @entity10 , @entity107 went into treatment at @entity115			2
@entity111 has been working to evacuate him for better care , said @entity117 , vice president of the agency			0
unfortunately , emergency medical evacuation flights in the area are not equipped to handle the " intense isolation " required for an @entity10 patient			2
@entity107 's family had been with him in @entity11 , according to the @entity124 , but left for the @entity24 before he became symptomatic ; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him			1
out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21 - day fever watch , the @entity124 said			0
" we have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support , " the @entity107 family said in a statement			2
" @entity137 remains very physically weak , but his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal			1
" @entity140 from @entity141 , @entity142 , has also been infected			0
she is employed by serving in @entity143 , or @entity144 , and had teamed up with the staff from @entity111 to help fight the @entity10 outbreak in @entity94 when she got sick			2
she , too , is undergoing treatment			0
it is believed one of the local staff was infected with @entity10 and came to work with the virus on monday and tuesday , @entity148 told @entity25			1
" we think it was in the scrub - down area where the disease was passed to both @entity140 and @entity137 , " he said			0
that staff member died on thursday			0
both @entity107 and @entity140 are stable , according to a statement released tuesday by @entity144 , though both patients are still exhibiting symptoms of the virus			0
" due to the upsurge in cases of @entity10 in the region , sim and @entity111 have taken the precautionary step of mandating the evacuation of all nonessential personnel from @entity11 , " the statement said			1
" timing , means , and place of evacuation are being decided now			0
" could @entity10 spread to the @entity24 ? the @entity124 held a media briefing monday to emphasize that there is " no significant risk " of an @entity10 outbreak in the @entity24			1
there has never been a confirmed case of @entity10 spreading to a developed country , said @entity181 , an epidemiologist with @entity182			2
" this is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick , have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations , they do n't travel			0
" and even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country , they will be in a good hospital with good infection control , so they are very unlikely to infect others , " she said			0
the @entity24 health care system is also better suited to handle an @entity10 case than many in @entity51 , said dr. @entity197 , director of @entity124 's @entity198			1
health officials would likely recognize such a case and be able to trace all points of contact with the patient to prevent further transmission , he said			0
" epidemics of disease are often followed by epidemics of fear and epidemics of stigma , " @entity197 said			0
" all of these things occur in a social context that can make containment very challenging			0
" that said , @entity0 did end up on an airplane at an international airport : what 's to say others might not do the same , and actually make it to the @entity24 ? count @entity25 chief medical correspondent @entity220 among those who believe " it 's going to happen at some point			1
" one big reason is that it takes 2 to 21 days between the time a person is infected and when he or she shows symptoms -- including vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function , and sometimes internal and external bleeding			0
@entity10 is not contagious until symptoms appear , though that does n't mean a person can not travel in the incubation period			2
" just observing the whole process , it 's almost impossible to prevent from happening , " @entity220 said			1
" but i think ... it can be then stemmed , so it does n't turn into all these mini-secondary outbreaks			0
" what should i do ? avoiding these @entity51 countries is the easiest way to prevent the outbreak from spreading , @entity197 said			2
if you have traveled recently to the region and develop a fever , or other symptoms consistent with @entity10 , notify your doctor right away			2
if you 're a humanitarian worker in the region , you need to be familiar with proper infection control precautions and avoid contact with blood or any other bodily fluids , he said			0
you should also report any needle sticks or possible exposures early to receive testing and , if necessary , start treatment as soon as possible			0
the @entity0 family is working with their church community to start " @entity261 against @entity10 , " @entity15 said			1
their goal is to raise $ 500,000 to help two international organizations : @entity111 and @entity265			0
how can those with the disease be helped ? while experimental vaccines exist , there are no licensed ones that get widespread use , according to the @entity57			0
the disease can be devastating and , ultimately , deadly in a few ways			0
one is because it " disarms your immune system , ( so it ) can not fight the virus , " @entity220 notes			2
another is that it causes people to lose fluids , because of vomiting and diarrhea in addition to bleeding , as @entity10 inhibits one 's ability to clot , adds @entity220			1
the most important thing a person needs to do to survive is to get treated as early and effectively as possible			0
but that 's not always easy in some parts of @entity51 , says @entity292 , a nurse with the humanitarian organization @entity182			1
" we go into communities where we are not necessarily welcome , because they understand now that the survival rate is not very high , " @entity292 told @entity25 's @entity293			1
@entity292 acknowledges that , in addition to immediate family members , health care workers are among those at highest risk of being infected			2
one need look no farther than dr. sheik @entity302 , a doctor who was on the front lines fighting the @entity10 outbreak in @entity52 before dying this week from complications of the disease			2
health care workers don gowns , gloves and masks , among other measures , to guard against the disease			0
" every inch of the body has to be covered , " @entity292 said			0
" ebola doctor in @entity52 dies			0

family : infected @entity24 " very physically weak , but his spirit ( is ) determined "
@entity25 's @entity220 : curbing @entity10 almost " impossible , " but it can be contained
@entity0 's family lives @entity3 ; he worked in @entity11 and died in @entity8
*hundreds* have been infected with @entity10 around @entity51
