-- companies that made and set up trailers used as emergency housing after @entity4 have agreed to a nearly $ 43 million settlement with people who say they were hurt by formaldehyde in the units			1
the settlement has been submitted to a federal judge in @entity10 , said @entity11 , a lawyer for plaintiffs in the class - action lawsuit			1
a hearing has been set for september for final approval , but a preliminary @entity16 could come this week , he said			1
an estimated 60,000 people are believed eligible for a share of the settlement , he said			1
as many as 114,000 households were lodged in " @entity21 trailers " after the disaster , which killed more than 1,700 people when it struck near the @entity27 - @entity26 state line in august 2005			1
more trailers were deployed after @entity29 , which struck southwestern @entity27 and southeast @entity30 a month later			2
but as @entity0 first reported in 2007 , the units -- built originally as campers -- led to widespread complaints that high levels of formaldehyde were causing respiratory ailments and irritation for those living in them			0
formaldehyde is an industrial chemical that is linked to nasal cancer , respiratory problems and leukemia			0
it was used to make particle board and plywood in the campers , which the government later banned for long - term housing			0
more than $ 37 million of the settlement will come from seven companies that made travel trailers that the @entity21 deployed across the hurricane - stricken @entity55 after @entity4 , @entity11 said			1
the amount is a significant extension of a preliminary deal struck in april , which involved fewer manufacturers , he said			2
the remainder of the settlement will come from contractors who installed the units , @entity11 said			2
a lawyer for the manufacturers and contractors declined comment on the settlement wednesday			1
six smaller manufacturers have already agreed to separate settlements , most of which remain under seal			0
another settlement , in 2011 , saw mobile - home builders paying more than $ 2.6 million over the claims			0
the amount each plaintiff receives will depend on how many people participate , a number @entity11 said ca n't be calculated at this time			0
lawyers who represented them will receive a portion of the settlement -- to be determined by the court -- as payment , he said			0
@entity0 's @entity86 and @entity87 contributed to this report .			0

an estimated 60,000 people could share in the settlement , a lawyer says
the deal must be approved by a federal judge in september
