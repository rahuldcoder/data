-- @entity2 's stunning announcement that she had a preventive double mastectomy raised both awareness and questions about the gene that led to her decision -- @entity8			2
so what is the gene , and how can it increase a woman 's risks for breast and ovarian cancers ? a primer : what is @entity8 ? @entity8 and brca 2 are types of tumor - suppressing genes , according to the @entity20			1
in normal cells , those genes help stabilize the cell 's dna and help prevent uncontrollable cell growth			0
but harmful mutations in @entity28 genes can lead to breast or ovarian cancer			2
five reasons we love @entity2 what do @entity8 and @entity28 stand for ? the acronyms stem from the full names of the genes : breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2			1
what 's the difference between @entity8 and @entity28 ? the genes are very similar			0
but harmful mutations in @entity8 can lead to breast cancers that are harder to treat because they do n't respond to hormone therapies used to treat tumors that occur more often in women with @entity28 mutations , according to @entity49			1
what 's the likelihood of getting breast or ovarian cancer if you have a @entity28 mutation ? about 12 % of all women will develop breast cancer sometime in their lives , the @entity20 says			1
but for women with a harmful @entity28 mutation , the risk of breast cancer quintuples to 60 %			1
@entity63 , which created a test to screen for such mutations , said the risk of breast cancer can be as high as 87 % for those with @entity28 abnormalities			2
as for ovarian cancer , about 1.4 % of women will have the disease sometime in their lives , according to the @entity20			0
but the risk for women with a harmful brca mutation increases to 15 % to 40 %			1
how surgeons build new breasts how can you tell if you have @entity8 and @entity28 mutations ? a blood test at a hospital or doctor 's office can help detect @entity8 and @entity28 mutations , according to the @entity20			2
results could take several weeks , as the test must be performed by a laboratory that specializes in the screening			0
but testing can cost anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars , and insurance companies may or may not cover the cost			0
only women with increased risk from family history are likely to benefit from such genetic testing , according to the @entity95			0
only 3 % to 5 % of women who develop breast cancer have a brca mutation , and about 10 % to 15 % of women with ovarian cancer have a brca mutation			1
can @entity28 abnormalities affect men ? yes			0
although only 1 % of all breast cancers occur in men , having a @entity28 mutation means an increased risk , particularly for men with @entity28 mutations , according to @entity49			0
harmful brca mutations also raise a man 's chance of developing cancer of the pancreas , skin or prostate			1
why more women are choosing double mastectomies			0

mutations in the tumor - suppressing gene @entity8 can increase the risk of cancer
harmful brca mutations can increase a woman 's risk for breast cancer five times
a test can help detect mutations , but can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars
most women with breast or ovarian cancers do n't have a brca mutation
