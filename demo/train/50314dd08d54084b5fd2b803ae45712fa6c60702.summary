-- " life is difficult , " said the first line of the first self - help book i ever held in my hands			1
" this is a great truth , " it continued			2
" because once we truly see this truth , we transcend it ... once it is accepted , the fact that life is difficult no longer matters			2
" though i was a child and barely knew what they meant , the words spoke to me			1
they resonated because it was 1979 , and i was fleeing a revolution			2
suddenly i had no country and no home			1
overnight , life had become unfathomably difficult			2
an @entity22 child refugee now living in @entity23 , i was a stranger in a strange new land			1
now i 'd fixated on some stranger 's copy of " @entity27 , " @entity29 's classic			2
self - help books elicit extreme reactions , ranging from " ca n't stand them " to " make me want to vomit " and " poke my eyes out			1
" as a whole , they 're considered lowbrow , and not the cool kind of lowbrow either ; they 're often used in films as a device to mark the protagonist 's lowest depths of desperation			2
but to dismiss self - help is folly			1
this is not just because the genre sells loads of books , audio , video and online products , seminars and personal coaching services			1
in fact , the @entity23 self - improvement market is an almost $ 11 billion industry , with projected annual gains of more than 5 % over the next several years , according to @entity59			1
the real reason to take it seriously is because here and there , amid the trite and banal , lies a gem that might shift your perception instantly , such as the drawing of the beautiful young woman that transforms in a blink into a haggard old crone in the late @entity72 's " @entity61			1
" what do the books do for us ? i asked folks to share their self - help experiences via social media ; anecdotes ran from life - altering insights to guffaws prompted by sappy @entity84 advice			1
" i have used them through bouts of depression as well as during happier , more stable times , " wrote @entity85			2
" if i had n't stumbled across @entity93 's book , ' why does he do that , ' about women living in abusive relationships , i shudder to think of what my life would look like today			2
" self - help books are like pep talks , said @entity98			1
" i highlight them and copy favorite quotes into blank books			1
" " they 're good for equipping yourself with skills and insights outside local sources of wisdom , " said @entity102			2
" if you were to leave me on a planet with my wife to reboot the human race , i would take ' @entity113 ' with me			0
" " a lot cheaper than therapy ! " said @entity114			0
" cheaper than therapy , but nowhere near as effective , " replied @entity117			0
" i just do n't like mass - produced advice for really serious issues like depression			1
i always think of this scene in ' @entity123			0
' " the scene shows @entity124 gulping wine as she sings along tearily to a @entity127 song -- a self - help manual at her side			1
@entity130 pointed out : " is n't the @entity131 like a big self - help book ? ! " @entity134 's thinking ran along similar lines			1
" while divine guidance is free , people pay for superficial happiness , " she wrote			0
" the public library is free too ! " retorted my cheeky friend , @entity139			0
" i think we 're seeing the dawn of the science - based self - help book , and some of these have been really amazing			1
" he recommended @entity148 's " @entity147 " and @entity150 's " @entity149			0
" if you were to ask me earlier this week whether i am a reader of self - help books , i would n't have identified myself as such -- and certainly not in the secretly smug way i own up to having read scores of science fiction			1
but as i stood before my bookshelf looking for my old copy of @entity72 's " 7 habits " the day i heard about his passing , i found it , along with a half - dozen other books that were unabashedly self - help			1
i pulled them out and flipped through each one , noting the passages i had highlighted			0
" people must face that which they fear , " wrote @entity166 in " @entity167			0
" " resistance has no strength of its own			0
every ounce of juice it possesses comes from us			0
we feed it with power by our fear of it			0
master that fear and we conquer @entity170 , " wrote @entity180 in " @entity181 " " apply ass to chair , " wrote @entity184 in " how to write			0
" i even found an @entity187 quote scribbled in the margins of an @entity190 book : " let me tell you how the universe works : first you get a little whisper			0
then you get a little thump on the head			0
then you get a brick			0
then you get a brick wall			0
" i recalled that when i wrote those words , i had indeed looked back and considered the whisper , the thump and the brick , right after i had hit the brick wall			0
" @entity207 fiction is important , " wrote the novelist @entity204 in a @entity206 piece earlier this year			1
" it is a vital means of imagining a life other than our own , which in turn makes us more empathetic beings			0
" maybe the same can be said about some self - help books			1
that they are not as much " self - help " as they are pilgrims ' notes from the journey of life , to help us define and imagine new realities beyond our immediate perception			2
and the possibility of what could be , what might be and perhaps even what will be .			0
