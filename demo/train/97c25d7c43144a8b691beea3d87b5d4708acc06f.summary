-- i got married the saturday before @entity2			1
my partner @entity3 and i had been a couple for nearly nine years and living together for six			1
which is why the most frequent refrain she and i heard all weekend was , " it 's about time ! " so why , after all these years , did we decide to tie the knot ? well , it has something to do with gay marriage			1
we live in @entity14 , @entity15			0
ever since the voters of our state enacted marriage equality in a 2012 referendum , dozens of friends have entered into same - sex marriages			1
many had been together for years or even decades but rushed to get the seal of the state on their unions			1
what has struck me about this boomlet of connubial bliss -- a steady parade of weddings with double white dresses or double tuxedos , and all the traditional trappings and rituals -- is that something very deeply @entity37 is happening : we are using progress to conserve an institution			0
and / or : we are conserving something to make progress			0
i 'd supported @entity42 and spoken out in favor of it			0
the argument i 'd made most often was that interracial marriage had once been illegal , and a ban on same - sex marriage was similarly unjust and repugnant			1
the analogy seemed direct , and the need for straight allies of color to stand up for marriage equality seemed urgent			1
after the campaign , watching all these couples who 'd fought for recognition finally achieve it and joyfully claim it , i was stirred by something other than social justice			1
i began to appreciate more deeply what marriage truly means , why it matters , and how the experience of a ceremony and a public commitment -- to say nothing of the shared life that 's thereby transformed -- is so necessary			1
now , to be sure , there were some visceral reasons why @entity3 and i had for so long stuck with cohabitation and " practically married " status			1
each of us had been married once before , and the endings had left us both a little wary			2
what helped get us over that wariness was in part the passage of time and the strengthening of our bond as we experienced life together , for better and worse			0
part of it too was the catalytic example of our gay and lesbian friends , neighbors and colleagues			2
they showed us that marriage is different			2
that " wife " and " husband " are different from " partner " or " girlfriend / boyfriend			2
" that vows spoken publicly are different from assurances whispered privately			0
that if fear should block us from exercising a right like the right to marry , then we should consider how it 'd feel to be denied the right altogether			0
that the reason this institution is vital is that in the end it 's not about rights ; it 's about responsibility -- of one spouse to the other ; of the couple to their people , and vice versa			1
opponents of marriage equality have claimed that letting gays and lesbians marry would devalue marriage , subvert its purposes , lead to the collapse of families			2
in poll after poll , across the country , the anti-equality advocates are losing			0
more importantly , though , in state after state , they 're being proven wrong			0
marriage today has a new glow to it , a vibrancy that comes with the entry of all these same - sex newcomers			1
it 's akin to the way that immigrants have revitalized dying rural towns and neglected urban neighborhoods , injecting new blood , new money , and new energy into dilapidated structures			2
eight days before we spoke our vows in front of family and friends , @entity3 and i went to the courthouse			1
our friend who performed the legal wedding there is a justice of the @entity152			0
since the passage of marriage equality she 's been the go - to judge for same - sex weddings			1
there are two reasons why			0
@entity159 , she is lesbian and a pioneer in the legal community			0
two , her name is @entity163			0
when someone named @entity163 marries you , things feel right			0
and when our big wedding ceremony a week later concluded with vows that all our people made to us , the larger implications of marriage equality became vividly clear			2
far from subverting or undermining the institution of marriage , gays and lesbians are fortifying it			2
not just by forming their own families			0
but also by giving people like me and @entity3 the courage to remake ours			1
so yes , i speak stoutly in defense of marriage -- marriage for all -- and i do so because i am grateful to be reminded by those once excluded what a powerful thing it is to join the matrimonial tribe .			0

@entity190 : my *longtime* partner , @entity3 , and i finally got married before @entity2
