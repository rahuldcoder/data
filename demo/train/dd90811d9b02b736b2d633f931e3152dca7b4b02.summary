-- doctors studying to become dermatologists have , for years , shared exam questions by memorizing and writing them down after the test to become board certified , @entity0 has confirmed			1
reports of the use of what are known as " airplane notes " comes after revelations last month that radiology residents around the country for years also have used what are known as " recalls " to prepare for the written exam , which is one step in becoming certified by the @entity16			1
in the wake of the @entity0 story , the group that oversees 24 medical specialties issued a statement condemning the use of the recalls			1
the @entity23 said on its website that , " it should be made abundantly clear that recalling and sharing questions from exams violates exam security , professional ethics and patient trust in the medical profession			1
when it happens , the practice should be addressed swiftly and decisively			0
whether someone is providing or using test questions , @entity32 enforce sanctions that may include permanent barring from certification , and / or prosecution for copyright violation			2
" @entity0 has confirmed the practice also exists with dermatology , where the recalls are known as " airplane notes , " because residents write down as much as they can remember on the plane after taking the test			1
in an anonymous e-mail to the @entity48 in 2008 , a resident wrote : " the board needs to know that there is an organized effort year after year to , by verbatim , reproduce each and every question of the official @entity48 certifying examination minutes after its completion			0
so - called " airplane notes " ... are well known to dermatology residents and are compiled , typed up and quietly distributed among residency programs across the country			1
" the resident , now a practicing dermatologist , wrote , " each year , minutes after the certifying exam is complete , there is an almost ceremonial meeting of examinees at a local hotel or restaurant there in @entity67			0
a feverish and collective effort is made by examinees from many programs to reproduce on paper as many questions as they can -- verbatim -- that they had just encountered			2
this is then integrated into an updated " airplane notes , " which then has questions from the year before , and the year before that , etc. , in an organized fashion			1
these are even professionally bound at @entity80 's at times			0
" in a response to the e-mail , the board 's executive director , dr. @entity81 , wrote : " the board takes every precaution to discourage this practice amongst graduating residents : maintaining strict security of items , minimizing the number of previously used questions , and requiring an honor code statement ( signed two separate times ) declaring that information will not be shared			1
unfortunately we have no mechanism for enforcing the honor code or controlling interpersonal communications that occur after an examination			0
the real issue is how do we police professionalism and how do we identify the offenders ? " @entity104 said she has addressed this issue for several years during the board 's annual meeting by telling dermatology residents the practice is not allowed			1
" i 've never seen airplane notes , but i 've heard about it , " @entity104 said			1
" we really try to do something to prevent it from happening , " @entity104 said			2
" it 's a high stakes examination and people are naturally very anxious about it and that brings out the potential worst in people			0
" asked if she considered this cheating , @entity104 said , " yes , but i ca n't prove it - period			1
" the board has warned residents that using airplane notes is illegal , because test questions are copyrighted			1
" there are legal consequences to this practice , as the questions of the @entity48 are protected by copyright laws , and any reproduction , not approved by the board , illegal			2
but , of much greater importance , this practice is unethical and violates our professionalism and ethical standards , which are the basis for the trust given us by our patients , " one board newsletter obtained by @entity0 reads			1
dermatology residents confirm the practice has been widespread , but the value of the actual airplane notes varies depending on the accuracy of the memorization			1
the dermatology board scrambles the approximately 300 questions from test to test to make it more difficult to memorize them			1
about 20 % of the questions each year are recycled from old tests , compared with about 50 % for the written exam in radiology			2
" we scramble the questions so that discourages the rote memorization , " @entity104 said			2
after a phone interview , @entity104 agreed to an an on - camera interview with @entity0 to discuss the recalls			1
but she abruptly canceled the interview two days beforehand , saying she had changed her mind			0
while the use of airplane notes and recalls has been discussed for years in dermatology and radiology , they are not widely known outside those professions			1
dr. @entity173 , executive director of the @entity16 , said using recalls was cheating			1
" i am saying it 's cheating			2
it 's a violation of our policy , " @entity173 said			0
dr. @entity179 , the radiology board 's president - elect , said said the test - taking culture has changed since he took the exam in 1978			0
" right now , in radiology , jobs are hard to find			0
board certification is very , very important			0
when i took the exam , you could still practice without being a board - certified radiologist			0
now , that 's virtually impossible , " @entity179 said			0
" so , a high - stakes examination , and the other thing is it 's a difference in culture			0
these individuals sort of view us as a system , and them as outside the system , and there 's this issue of sort of stick it to the man			0
you know , that we 're the system , and they can do this and it 's acceptable			0
we tell them it 's not acceptable			0
" @entity173 said that despite the use of the recalls , the public is protected because of the overall training and an intensive oral exam that residents must undergo to become certified			2
next year , the board is rolling out a new exam for the first time in more than 10 years			0
instead of two written tests and one oral exam , the first exam will be a " core exam " taken after three years of residency training , and the second certifying exam will be taken 15 months after graduation			0
the oral exam is being eliminated			0
meanwhile , @entity226 , which does not certify radiologists , posted a statement on its website after the @entity0 story aired			1
" the most troubling aspect of this report is the implication that all radiologists who pass these examinations are ' cheaters			0
' the allegation of cheating not only involves an unspecified and unidentified number of individuals , but smears the entire specialty with a broad and unjustified brush , " the statement said			2
" whether one considers the sharing of mentally recalled questions to be unethical , or simply a type of study aid , board certification represents significantly more than passing an exam , and should not be impugned simply on the basis of examination methodology , " it said			1
asked whether the group considered recalls cheating , a spokesman said it had no comment beyond the statement			2
other medical specialties contacted by @entity0 said they had not experienced that kind of systemic use of recalls			1
the @entity261 has sent investigators into test review company classes to ensure they are n't teaching from old test questions			1
" when we 've investigated these groups and ( gone ) through these classes , we 've never found old exams , " said board spokesman @entity265			0
the board only re-uses " a very small number of questions " from old exams , he said			2
@entity273 re-uses about 20 % of old questions each year			0
" we know of no similar recall registry of questions such as was in your piece ( about ) the radiology residents , " said the board 's executive director , dr. @entity275			1
