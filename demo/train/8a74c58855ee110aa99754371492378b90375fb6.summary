-- a remake , a prequel , and one woefully misguided bird - watching comedy could n't take down @entity4 and the robots of " @entity6 " at the box office this weekend			1
" steel " punched up an estimated $ 16.3 million this weekend , marking a healthy 40 percent drop from its $ 27.3 million debut			2
as evidenced by the film 's impressive 64 percent boost on saturday , it appears that " @entity6 " is playing as an outright family affair , and that sort of appeal will help it achieve small drops in the coming weeks			1
still , the $ 110 million @entity19 film , which is being distributed by @entity21 's @entity20 , has a very long way to go before it 's in the black			1
so far , " @entity6 " has earned $ 51.7 million in ten days			1
@entity27 's $ 24 million remake " @entity26 " managed to open in second place with $ 16.1 million , a rather lackluster result			1
instead of playing like a hyped - up event movie , " @entity26 " played much more like a typical dance flick			1
it attracted fewer dance fans than movies like " @entity33 " ( 2001 , $ 23.4 million opening ) and " @entity35 " ( 2006 , $ 20.7 million opening ) , but it performed on the same level as " @entity38 " ( 2010 , $ 15.8 million opening ) and " @entity40 " ( 2004 , $ 16.1 million )			1
the film played best with women , who made up 75 percent of the audience , and older moviegoers , who composed 61 percent of the opening weekend crowd			1
" footloose " earned a solid " a " @entity47 grade , and strong word - of - mouth could help it dance its way out of financial trouble , but it will not be able to match the $ 80 million total that the original " footloose " achieved back in 1984			1
in third , @entity55 's horror prequel " @entity56 " did n't scare up many ticket sales this weekend , opening with $ 8.7 million			1
the film , which totes a reported $ 35 million budget , performed below @entity55 's expectations , becoming the latest 2011 horror film to not connect with audiences			1
movies like " @entity64 " ( $ 38.2 million total ) , " @entity66 " ( $ 33 million ) , and " @entity67 " ( $ 29.1 million ) have all struggled at the box office this year			2
even " thing " star @entity69 's former franchise film , " @entity70 , " performed unremarkably , earning only $ 42.1 million			1
the best comparison for " @entity56 " is probably " @entity73 , " which opened with a similar $ 8.5 million and finished with $ 23.2 million			1
considering " @entity56 " earned a weak " b - " cinemascore grade and a sad $ 2,990 per theater average , that total is about the best it can hope for			1
@entity79 's political thriller " the @entity80 " held very well in its sophomore weekend , dipping only 28 percent to $ 7.5 million in fourth place			2
that decline is far less severe than @entity79 's other recent political flicks , " @entity85 " and " @entity86 , " which dropped by 57 and 54 percent in their second weekends , respectively			2
perhaps @entity79 has made a political movie that 's a bit more palatable for general audiences -- or perhaps it 's just the @entity93 effect			2
either way , after ten days , " @entity80 , " which cost @entity94 $ 12.5 million to produce , has earned $ 22.2 million			2
if it keeps up the soft declines , it could become a serious @entity99 contender			2
" @entity101 " spent one last weekend in the @entity100 , sliding 31 percent to $ 6.3 million			0
after four weekend 's @entity105 ' surprise @entity103 hit has accrued a nice $ 58.7 million total			0
along with " @entity107 " ( $ 57.7 million after four weeks ) and " @entity108 " ( $ 90.5 million after five ) , " @entity101 " is one of the few box office bright spots since " the help			0
" the weekend 's other new wide release , " @entity113 , " debuted way back in ninth place with $ 3.3 million out of 2,150 theaters			0
@entity116 spent $ 41 million on the @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity120 bird - watching collaboration that was n't quite a comedy , was n't quite a drama , was n't quite a competition film , and apparently was n't at all enticing for audiences , who gave the picture a " b - " cinemascore grade			1
between the financial failure of " @entity113 , " and 2006â € ²s " @entity128 , " which opened to $ 3.4 million out of 3,018 theaters , maybe @entity130 should think twice about the appeal of birds at the box office			0
they do n't always soar			0
in limited release , @entity135 's deeply creepy " @entity140 " got off to a strong start , with $ 231,000 in six theaters , good for a robust $ 38,500 per theater average			0
internationally , tastes were n't quite as refined , as " @entity142 " finally passed $ 400 million overseas			0
