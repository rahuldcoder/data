-- it did n't start out this way , but i 'm in a long - distance relationship			1
having your boyfriend live 1,300 miles away is n't ideal , but as far as problems in relationships go , things could be much worse : he could be in @entity10 or i could have caught him cheating on me with various tattooed women after i won an @entity12 and adopted a baby			1
so , this is n't some sappy , romantic article on ways to " @entity17			1
" here 's the real problem : a third party has entered my relationship , causing fights , miscommunication and anxiety			2
she 's sleek , sexy and smooth			2
her name is ... the @entity25			1
when your beloved lives a plane ride away , the phone becomes your main source of staying connected , but @entity25 -- you are making this a challenge ... am i just supposed to turn the other cheek because you are an otherwise wonderful multi-media device ? both my boyfriend and i have an @entity25			1
for those of you who are owners , you know it is notorious for dropping calls , having terrible reception , and overall , they 're really awesome for playing @entity39 and @entity40 , but for actual phone use , my five - pound @entity41 from 1997 worked better			1
in all seriousness , these technical difficulties have either caused arguments or added to an already tense moment			1
for instance , the other day we were having a little argument over @entity50 , when he all of the sudden logged off -- which , in instant messaging terms , is the equivalent of hanging up the phone or getting the door slammed in your face			2
but apparently , he had logged off to call me , and my phone did n't even ring			2
he 's thinking , " what the hell , pick up the phone ! " this goes on for a while , until i get a " voicemail " notification that he called			2
i tried calling him back , but none of the phone calls would go through			1
the final blow was when i got a delayed text from him saying : " i tried to call you			0
where did you go ? " @entity81 ! eventually , we managed to reach each other and everything was totally fine , but if it were n't for our iphones , those two hours of anxiety would have never happened			0
because so many people have been complaining about the poor service , @entity88 has introduced a reception tower to place in your home or office that amps up your reception			1
initially , i thought : yes ! a solution ! but then the bitterness set in			0
let me get this straight : i not only paid $ 300 for a " superior " phone , i also shell out over $ 100 a month in fees			0
now you want me to fork over another $ 150 so i can get service ? i 'm insulted			0
i 'm still undecided on what to do			0
i know there is @entity104 and video chatting , among other sources of technological - aided communication , but i 'm stubborn , and i want to be able to call my boyfriend when i want to			0
it 's a simple request			0
so , i guess -- deep in my heart -- i know the solution : i just have to wait for the @entity112 to come out			0
i 'm sure that will solve everything			0
