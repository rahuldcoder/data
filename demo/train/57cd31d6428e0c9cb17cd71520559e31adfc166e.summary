-- less than three months after @entity4 gov. @entity3 cruised to an overwhelming reelection win , the main political question he faces is n't whether he can make a transition to the national stage and run for president -- it 's whether he can continue to govern the state at all			1
negative press about the so - called @entity12 scandal -- an apparent decision by top @entity3 aides to close lanes on the @entity16 and snarl traffic for days on end , allegedly out of petty political spite toward local officials -- has taken a severe toll on @entity3 's national prospects : a recent poll confirms that he has tumbled from first to third place as a potential 2016 presidential candidate			1
but that could prove to be the least of @entity3 's headaches			1
a more pressing matter is raised by a short , devastating letter penned by @entity31 , the lawyer for a former top aide to @entity3 , @entity33 , and published on the @entity35 website			1
the immediate point of the letter was to press the @entity38 , the agency that operates the @entity16 , to pay @entity33 's legal expenses			2
but it 's not just a financial dispute			2
if @entity33 , who personally oversaw the lane closures , was following orders requested or approved from on high , he can demand legal protection by the agency			0
but by refusing to cover his costs , the @entity38 is saying , in effect , that @entity33 was acting on his own			0
the letter by @entity33 's attorney bluntly suggests otherwise : " it has also come to light that a person within the @entity3 administration communicated the @entity3 administration 's order that certain lanes on the @entity16 were to be closed , and evidence exists as well tying mr. @entity3 to having knowledge of the lane closures , during the period when the lanes were closed , contrary to what the governor stated publicly in a two - hour press conference			1
the @entity3 administration hastily responded with a statement that the governor " had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever mr. @entity33 's motivations were for closing them to begin with			1
" but the damage was done : the scandal now has the potential to be carried directly into the inner circle of the governor 's office , and undermine his credibility			1
until now , @entity3 has employed a blunt but effective two - step strategy for containing the scandal			1
step one : summarily fire and publicly condemn deputies who were linked to the scandal			0
step two : plead utter ignorance as to how or why these top aides would engage in unethical or illegal behavior			0
the strategy was never quite plausible -- @entity3 , a former prosecutor , has a reputation as a hands - on manager whose aides do n't stray far without permission -- and it 's a risky gambit : by publicly denigrating fired members of his inner circle , @entity3 opens himself to the possibility of disgruntled ex-employees going public with information that is embarrassing , or even incriminating			1
one can only imagine what @entity33 was thinking during @entity3 's two - hour press conference , in which he blasted @entity102 and another fired ex-aide , @entity104 , for " abject stupidity			1
" " what did i do wrong to have these folks think it was ok to lie to me ? " he said during the press conference			0
adding insult to injury , @entity3 went so far as to say that @entity33 , often described in the press as a high school friend , was n't really a @entity3 pal			2
" @entity33 and i were not friends in high school			0
we were not even acquaintances in high school , " @entity3 said			2
" we did n't travel in the same circles in high school			0
you know , i was the class president and athlete			0
i do n't know what @entity33 was doing during that period of time			0
" at least one commentator , @entity126 , thinks that personal snub might make @entity33 more inclined to turn on @entity3			2
" what if @entity33 is sitting on some goods ? is he going to be happy being dismissed as too geeky for @entity3 to waste his time on back in high school ? " @entity126 asks , concluding : " the nerd is striking back			2
" as a matter of political technique , @entity3 's swift firings and forceful denials seem credible in the short term -- but they also echo at least one time when the denounce - and - fire tactic backfired			1
in 2010 , after @entity4 's request for millions in federal education funds was rejected -- in part because the final request lacked key budget estimates -- @entity3 publicly castigated and fired his education commissioner , @entity146 , allegedly for lying to him about what went wrong with the application			1
but @entity146 swiftly struck back , producing e-mails and other documents that showed he had , indeed , told @entity3 up front about the application 's shortcomings			1
" i will not accept being defamed by the governor for something he knows i did not do , " wrote @entity146			0
" the governor called me a liar this week			0
that was the last straw			0
" the @entity146 episode is important			0
will @entity3 's strenuous denials of knowledge of @entity12 -- and his suggestion that his top aides lied to him -- hold up under scrutiny ? indeed , the state 's most powerful newspaper , the @entity167 , is already warning @entity3 that the end may be near			1
within hours of the publication of @entity33 letter suggesting @entity3 knew about @entity12 , the paper published a hard - hitting editorial			1
" if this charge proves true , then the governor must resign or be impeached			0
because that would leave him so drained of credibility that he could not possibly govern effectively , " the editorial says			0
" he would owe it to the people of @entity4 to stop the bleeding and quit			2
" for @entity3 , it 's been a long , bumpy road			1
he began november with a spectacular reelection and a coveted spot on the cover of @entity188			0
he enters february with troubling hints that his governorship may be damaged beyond repair			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity12 has hit @entity4 gov. @entity3 's national prospects hard
his response to the scandal seem credible in the short term , says @entity194
louis : the strategy was never quite plausible ; @entity3 has a hands - on reputation
louis : *pushback* from a former aide and fired education commissioner is damaging
