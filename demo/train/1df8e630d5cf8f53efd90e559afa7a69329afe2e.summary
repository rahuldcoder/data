@entity0 -- @entity0 and the @entity2 are again shadow boxing over the ordination of a new @entity6 bishop without the @entity8 's blessing			1
after years of quiet diplomacy and a tacit agreement to jointly appoint @entity6 bishops , the @entity9 -- which oversees the country 's state - sanctioned church -- in recent days ordained one bishop over the @entity2 's objections , while another was reportedly detained after resigning from the @entity18			1
" it 's worrisome , " said a catholic priest in @entity0 , who asked not to be identified			1
" are we going towards confrontation again ? " @entity23 detained after shunning @entity25 control the two sides have been estranged since 1957 , when @entity6 broke off relations with the @entity2			1
@entity0 then accused @entity28 of engaging in anti-socialist activities			1
in recent years , they have been talking quietly about restoring official relations			2
one big stumbling bloc remains the @entity2 's official diplomatic ties with @entity34 , which @entity6 considers a breakaway province			1
analysts say the two sides are close to reaching a modus vivendi on the diplomatic issue , but remain far apart on the ordination of bishops			2
the @entity18 said last year that it would press ahead with plans to appoint 40 new bishops , a challenge to the @entity2 's authority			1
" it 's a question of religious freedom and leadership of the @entity6 church , " explained the catholic priest			1
@entity6 's 10 million or so @entity50 remain divided between those who worship in illegal " underground ' churches " -- loyal to the @entity2 , defiant of @entity25 control -- and those in a state - approved churches			1
despite the division , and the festering spat between @entity6 and @entity28 , @entity6 @entity50 remain devoted to their faith			1
in recent years , @entity58 as other religions , are seeing a revival as more and more @entity6 turn to faith			2
congregations seem to be thriving , as i observed on a recent visit to the @entity67 parish , about two hours drive north of @entity0			2
a choir sung the @entity6 version of " @entity70 , " as 200 churchgoers heard father @entity72 deliver a sunday mass. since he moved to @entity67 last year , @entity74 , 45 , has turned a lethargic church into a vibrant congregation , as i discovered			2
" when i moved here , this church building was so old , its roof was collapsing , " @entity74 told me during a tour of the area			0
the @entity67 church was originally built in 1873 by the @entity84 religious order of @entity85 , before it was destroyed during the @entity86 in 1900 when members of an anti-foreign @entity86 attacked foreign missionaries , diplomats and traders , as well as @entity92 converts			0
more than 600 @entity50 were killed in @entity67 and buried in the ground where the church now stands , @entity74 said			2
rebuilt in 1902 , the church had been in disrepair until last year			0
" we repaired it without government help , " @entity74 said proudly			0
" individuals and groups contributed , in cash and in kind and with volunteer work			0
" more are joining the church			0
" when i just got here , there was only one 85 - year old lady who attended the daily mass , " he recalled			2
last year , 268 older residents were baptized , and this year over 50 young city - dwellers converted , too			2
" finally i can see some faces of young people , " he gushed			0
a @entity115 priest , who asked to remain anonymous , credits the 45 - year priest for adapting well to @entity6 's rapidly changing society			1
" father @entity72 is creating new urban congregations and that is exactly what the church in @entity6 should be doing -- continuing to minister in the old existing churches , or building new churches in old villages			1
" @entity74 noted that his diocese used to be home to at least 2,000 @entity50			2
" many of them are still going to the underground churches , " he said			1
" sometimes they invite me to their homes for a meal			0
they tell me they are eager to turn theirs into an open church , to worship @entity138 openly and devoutly			0
" his mission now , he said , is to encourage them to join the open churches			0
@entity74 used to worship underground			1
" for ten years , my family provided four houses for underground assembly , " he recalled			0
" in 1988 , we decided to worship openly			0
" that means joining the @entity9			2
a fourth - generation @entity115 , @entity74 attended a @entity0 seminary for five and a half years			1
he later enrolled in @entity150 and @entity151 universities , where he studied philosophy , psychology and church management			0
he also attended the @entity155 in @entity0 to learn about diplomacy			2
" merely preaching is not enough , " @entity74 said			0
" you have to learn some knowledge of international relations			0
" @entity74 has also learned how to balance his faith with the authority of the state			0
@entity74 disagrees , diplomatically , with @entity0 's defiance of the @entity2 in the ordination of bishops			1
" i think it 's not a good idea , " he said			0
" i do hope @entity6 government will pay attention to the universal idea , the universal church law of the @entity2			1
" at the same time i hope @entity2 can really understand the church in @entity6 and find out what it really looks like			1
" of course we follow @entity6 and we also follow the @entity50 way , " he added			1
" give to @entity178 what belongs to @entity178			0
what belongs to @entity138 , return it to @entity138			0
the state and church interaction is very dialectical			0
" for the foreseeable future , it seems , @entity6 @entity50 will just have to continue the balancing act between church and state			1
