thursday could be a key moment in the future of time keeping			1
more than 100 countries are due to decide on whether to keep the present method of adding so - called leap seconds to the global time system at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
currently , this @entity10 or @entity10 is based on a system of extremely accurate atomic clocks			1
but they are so precise that they do not match the rotation of the @entity16 which periodically speeds up and slows down due to the action of the tides and changes within the @entity16 's core			2
since 1972 these extra seconds are added or taken away from the timescale to make sure @entity10 is synchronized with the @entity16 's rotation			1
fifty years ago , a few seconds difference had less impact but many of our 21st century devices depend on incredible accuracy			1
@entity29 , senior research scientist in the @entity30 at the @entity32 's @entity31 , explains that people like astronomers also rely on this level of precision			0
" there are many applications today that depend on precise time keeping			0
for example , telecommunications use atomic clocks to keep the networks around the world synchronized precisely together , " he said			0
" satellite navigation -- sat navs in our cars and homes -- depend on signals being sent out from atomic clocks on board satellites			0
" but now many countries , including the @entity54 and most @entity56 nations , want to abandon the procedure which they say is too cumbersome			1
according to @entity29 , precise timing systems can be disrupted by altering them			0
the @entity32 , @entity61 and @entity62 are pressing to keep the leap seconds when the issue is discussed at the @entity67 's @entity66 meeting on thursday			2
" without a correction , eventually our clocks would show the middle of the day occurring at night , " said @entity29			0
" we have to have some means of making a correction but at the moment no one knows how that 's going to be done			0
" since 1972 @entity29 said only 24 leap seconds have been used and the rate has slowed because the @entity16 has been speeding up over the last few decades			2
without the leap seconds adjustment , the precise time measured by atomic clocks and time according to the @entity16 's rotation will start to deviate			1
although the tiniest inaccuracies might play havoc with our smart phones most of us would not notice the changes in our body clock -- it is estimated it will take more than 200 years to register an hour 's difference .			0
