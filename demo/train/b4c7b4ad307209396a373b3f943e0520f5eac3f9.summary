@entity0 , @entity1 -- you 've heard of the " @entity5 effect			2
" having the queen of talk endorse your product can be like winning the lottery			2
in the technology world , the same apparently applies to @entity11			1
that 's what some @entity14 grad students learned when the @entity17 ceo praised their @entity19 app during a recent event			1
@entity21 and his partner , @entity22 , both from @entity23 , have no experience in journalism			2
yet their creation , a mobile application called pulse that aggregates news from multiple sites , is one of the top - selling news apps for the @entity19 and its smaller cousin , the @entity35			1
the app got an unexpected boost when @entity11 mentioned it onstage at @entity17 's developers conference in june			1
" that was really special , " said @entity21 , co-founder and ceo of @entity40 , which produced the @entity29 app. " we got the biggest stamp of approval we could have gotten			1
" the idea for the app originated while the two were taking a @entity14 course for aspiring entrepreneurs			1
the class , called @entity52 , challenges students to create a product in the course of 11 weeks			2
@entity21 , 24 , who considers himself a news junkie , did n't like how he had to view several different apps to get the news he wanted			2
he wondered whether it would be possible to take content from news sites and , using rss feeds , create a rich , aesthetically pleasing app. @entity29 , which also has an app for @entity66 devices , allows users to assemble content from as many as 60 publications			1
users also can touch a link that takes them to the actual publication 's website			1
" the first week of class , we decided we 're going to do something for our @entity19 , and we released our app in six weeks , " @entity21 said			1
the pair had no real hopes for the app and did n't imagine turning it into a full - fledged business			1
and yet today their company has six full - time employees and is moving from the small @entity0 office it shares with other startups into its own office space			0
a representative from @entity90 recently paid a visit to inquire about a possible partnership , @entity21 said			0
" it 's been a truly exciting ride , and we hope it stays like that , " said @entity21			0
the pulse app costs $ 1.99 for the @entity19 and 99 cents for the @entity35 and mobile android devices			1
the company declined to disclose revenue figures			0
the @entity14 duo 's timing could not have been better			0
the mobile news industry is exploding as more and more people rely on smartphones and tablets to stay connected in their daily lives			0
smartphone sales increased by 50 percent in the second quarter of 2010 versus the same time last year , according to @entity112 , a leading tech research company			0
at the same time , advances in mobile devices have spawned a new generation of @entity117 entrepreneurs			2
@entity118 , @entity119 & @entity120 , the giant technology venture capital firm , set aside $ 200 million this year for products that build upon the @entity35 , @entity123 and @entity19			1
" welcome to the brave new @entity125 era where a swoosh of fluidity replaces the traditional mouse			0
... a new , truly revolutionary platform is rare , and a prize for entrepreneurs , " firm partner @entity129 said in a press release			0
some media companies , including @entity2 , see an opportunity to make a mark on these emerging platforms			0
" mobile news is a fertile ground for growth and innovation , " said @entity139 , vice president of @entity140			0
" we know a lot of people want to get news on phones			0
" @entity151 data show that @entity2 , which leads the mobile news category , has more than 14 million unique mobile users a month			2
users also tend to keep coming back			2
according to @entity2 data , the vast majority of consumers who download the @entity2 app for @entity35 are still using it a month later			1
@entity160 , who only a few months ago was in graduate school , still ca n't believe he stumbled into the news business			0
" the first thing we were thinking is , we 're spending a thousand dollars to get two @entity19			1
will we be able to recover that ? our goal was to sell a few of these apps and at least recover that , " he said			0
despite their sudden success , the two entrepreneurs have n't allowed themselves many splurges yet			0
in fact , @entity22 has yet to purchase an @entity35			1
" i 'm waiting for my upgrade window from @entity176 , " he said .			0
