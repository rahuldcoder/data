a prosecutor revealed a new allegation against @entity3 while trying to argue for a higher bail -- that @entity3 tried to choke his girlfriend a week and a half before monday 's alleged shotgun incident , and that @entity3 had talked about suicide			1
assistant state attorney @entity38 argued for $ 50,000 bail , saying that new information should heighten concern for the accuser 's safety , though the alleged incident had n't been reported to police			1
the new allegation is not reflected in the preliminary charges			2
but judge @entity48 cited the choking accusation when he put the bail at $ 9,000 , saying it prompted him to set it higher than the $ 4,900 requested by the defense			1
@entity55 and @entity56 , the public defenders representing @entity3 , told reporters afterward that they had n't known of the choking allegation previously			1
" that was news to us , " @entity55 said			0
" ... that was not contained in the arrest report , and that 's the first we 've heard about it			1
