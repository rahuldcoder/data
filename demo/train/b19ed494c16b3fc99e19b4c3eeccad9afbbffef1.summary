-- pope @entity1 and pope @entity2 are to be made into saints this weekend in an unprecedented double papal canonization			1
while millions across the world remember @entity2 affectionately , @entity1 -- known as " @entity1 " -- may not be as familiar			2
here are five things you need to know about the much - loved pontiff			0
he was born in poverty -- and proud of it @entity1 , the man who would become pope @entity1 , was the third of 13 surviving children born to a family of farmers in the tiny village of @entity17 , near @entity18 , northern @entity19 in november 1881			1
@entity1 left home to study for the priesthood at the age of 11 , but even after he became @entity1 in 1958 at the age of 76 he eschewed the trappings of his position , and refused to take advantage of it either for himself or his family			1
in his last will and testament , pope @entity1 wrote : " born poor , but of humble and respected folk , i am particularly happy to die poor			1
" i thank @entity30 for this grace of poverty to which i vowed fidelity in my youth ... which has strengthened me in my resolve never to ask for anything -- positions , money or favors -- never either for myself of for my relations and friends			0
" when @entity1 died in june 1963 he was mourned around the world as " @entity43 " ( " @entity1 " )			1
he left his personal " fortune " to the surviving members of his family -- they each received less than $ 20			1
he saved the lives of @entity47 fleeing the @entity48 @entity1 broke off from his religious training during the @entity50 to serve as a medical orderly and later as a military chaplain			2
during the @entity53 , by then an archbishop , was serving as head of the @entity56 's diplomatic mission to @entity57 , and as a @entity59 diplomat in @entity60			2
while there , he helped saved the lives of many @entity47 fleeing the @entity62 , providing them with transit visas and other vital paperwork which allowed them to leave @entity66			0
in recognition of his efforts , the @entity67 has petitioned @entity70 , the official memorial to the @entity47 victims of the @entity62 , to name @entity1 as one of the " @entity74 , " non-jews formally recognized for risking their lives to save @entity47			2
once he became @entity1 , @entity1 worked to improve relations between @entity80 and other faiths ; one of his reforms was to have the phrase " perfidious @entity47 " removed from the traditional good friday prayer			1
strictly speaking , he was n't the first pope @entity1 that honor belongs to cardinal @entity86 , one of a series of claimants to the papal throne during the late 14th and early 15th centuries , when the @entity80 was bitterly divided by the @entity91			1
the split , which lasted from 1378 till 1418 , saw rival @entity93 elected by separate factions of the church			0
@entity86 was named pope @entity1 in 1410 , but he was forced to abdicate -- alongside @entity93 @entity97 and @entity98 -- five years later to heal the divide			1
today , pope @entity97 is considered the only true pontiff from that period : @entity98 , @entity1 and his predecessor @entity102 are all regarded as " @entity103 , " which is why @entity1 became @entity1 , and not @entity103 when he was elected pope			1
pope @entity1 played a key role in the @entity106 in october 1962 , with the @entity107 and @entity108 teetering on the brink of nuclear war , pope @entity1 helped to bring both countries back from the edge , urging president @entity113 and @entity108 leader @entity114 to exercise restraint			1
during a message broadcast on @entity118 at the height of the crisis , the pontiff pleaded : " we beg heads of state not to remain deaf to the cry of humanity : ' peace , peace ! ' " " i 've heard that it [ the message ] got to @entity114 , " cardinal @entity127 , former archbishop of @entity128 , told @entity0			0
" the @entity1 is looking for peace , and why do n't you be the man of peace ? and he said ' ok , i 'll be the man of peace			0
' " days after the @entity1 's address , @entity114 began withdrawing @entity108 missiles from @entity135 , defusing the crisis			0
months later , @entity1 published the encyclical " @entity142 " ( " @entity143 " ) , addressed " to all men of good will " and calling on the world 's populations to coexist in harmony			2
watch : when @entity113 called on the @entity1 for help 5			0
unlike other saints , pope @entity1 only performed one miracle under the normal beatification and canonization process , a person who has lived a holy and virtuous life is first declared " venerable , " then " blessed " and finally named as a saint			1
candidates for sainthood must be shown to have performed two miracles			0
pope @entity2 , who is to be canonized at the same time as @entity1 , is said to have cured a @entity157 nun of parkinson 's disease , and a @entity160 woman of a cerebral aneurism			1
however , @entity1 has only been credited with one miracle			0
instead , the decision to canonize him is based on his huge popularity , and on his role as the " founder " of the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) , according to experts			0
" there already was one miracle certified for his beatification in 2000 , " @entity56 analyst @entity167 explained to @entity0 in september 2013			0
" @entity171 has decided he does n't have to pass go , does n't have to collect $ 200 , he can go directly to sainthood			0
" indeed , some would say that his canonization is already long overdue			0
in its entry on " the roly - poly pontiff ... [ who ] became a kind of father figure for the world , " the @entity175 notes that " had the ancient custom of popular canonization still been in effect in 1963 ... that favour would probably have been given to him immediately by the tearful crowd who were gathered in @entity187 when his death was announced			2

pope @entity1 is to be canonized , or made into a saint , in the @entity59 on *sunday*
known as " the good pope , " he *reigned* from 1958 until his death in 1963
he was born in poverty and said he was happy to die poor ; he left relatives $ 20 in his will
elected as an " interim " pope , he instead proved the most *daring* pontiff in decades
