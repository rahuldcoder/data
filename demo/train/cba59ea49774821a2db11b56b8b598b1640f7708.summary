rev. @entity0 greets @entity2 's mother @entity1 , and daughter , @entity4 , at memorial			1
( essence ) -- the rev. @entity0 has been a pillar of support for the @entity9 since the moment the world found out @entity2 passed away			1
@entity0 is one of the few people to have a close relationship with the @entity2 and the man they both revered , @entity13 , the @entity13			1
@entity15 sat down with @entity0 to talk about his connection to these two incredible men , how the jackson family is coping after participating in the most watched memorial service in recent history , and his thoughts about the naysayers who continue to mar @entity2 's legacy			1
essence : you had the unique opportunity to be close to two musical icons : @entity2 and @entity13			1
were they alike in any way ? @entity0 : they had some similarities , like both of them were very determined men			1
i can remember times when both of them faced challenges and responded to those challenges with pain from being disappointed by friends who they feel abandoned and betrayed them but neither one of them ever showed a lack of determination or conviction that they were born to do what they were meant to do			0
i never saw either of them at the point where they felt they had to give up			0
essence : @entity51 remembers @entity2 in fact , the more adversity , the more determined they became			1
they were very similar in that way			0
i remember when @entity2 was having the fight with @entity58 over his catalog			1
he talked to me about how some @entity61 big shots were n't in his corner anymore			2
these were people he had done so many things for but now they were n't returning his phone calls			2
he would just say , " i 'm going to beat them , rev. " essence : what do you say to those people like @entity72 's @entity71 or @entity74 congressman @entity73 who have publically said that @entity2 does n't deserve the accolades he 's currently receiving ? @entity76 : i debated @entity71 on his show last night and he , ironically , said that @entity2 was n't a pioneer like @entity13			1
i said , that 's funny because you attacked @entity13 when he died too			2
@entity2 has sold more records than anyone else in history			2
this man made the @entity85 's and the @entity86 's of the world			2
he made the cover of @entity90 countless times			0
these are not accolades that are debatable			0
essence : highlights of @entity2 's life no one is saying @entity2 and @entity13 did n't have their flaws			1
what we are saying is what they achieved allowed for barriers to be broken down on our behalf			0
to tell us that we should n't celebrate facts is to tell us that we must embrace this supremacist fantasy and i do n't think we should do that			0
essence : do you think that congresswoman @entity111 will get the resolution passed to memorialize @entity2 's memory as an @entity115 legend , musical icon and world humanitarian ? she 's getting some flack from some politicians			1
@entity76 : i think she will , because if she does n't get it passed on the first time , there will be so much political pressure that they will have to pass it			0
look at the reaction ! @entity2 's funeral ... more people watched it than the @entity131 's funeral			1
that 's not just black people			2
all the @entity134 and @entity135 did not dampen the outpouring of love all over the world			0
it was unprecedented and that 's why i believe this will pass			0
just like every network ended up covering his funeral as if he was a head of state , at the end of the day , the people have said that @entity2 deserves all of this			1
essence : how is the family doing now that the public memorial is completed ? @entity76 : they are strong and standing together			2
this is certainly devastating but they are a closer knit family than people think and have gone through crisis before			1
they are helping each other through this			0
i admire their strength and their bond			0
they know that i 'm always there for moral support			0
we 've always had that type of relationship and we always will .			0

the rev. @entity0 says people are *wrong* to attack @entity2 's legacy
says singer was n't perfect , but used his talent to *shatter* racial barriers
notes @entity2 's memorial was like that of a head of state , more viewed than pope 's
@entity0 : @entity2 's family is more close - knit than people think
