-- in a decision that sidesteps a major shift in labor policy , the @entity2 @entity1 ruled monday that @entity6 ca n't force home health care workers to pay dues to unions			1
the narrow 5 - 4 ruling applies most directly to the @entity6 home care providers who challenged a state decision to classify them as public employees and require them to pay fees to a union			1
but it also deals a blow to union efforts nationwide to extend their reach in an era of declining membership and political influence			2
" these home workers share a lot of attributes of the new emerging work force , and for unions , it 's a big blow because that was their growth area , " @entity26 professor @entity25 said			1
" and it 's going to be very difficult now to extend these contracts to get those types of dues			0
" still , the ruling was not as broad as many union activists had feared , falling well short of what some had predicted would be a vote to gut a 37 - year - old @entity1 decision allowing for what 's known in labor circles as the agency shop system			2
read the ruling ( @entity45 ) instead , the court created a new category of " partial public employees " who ca n't be compelled to pay into the union system			1
" a narrow decision , a loss for the unions but not as catastrophic as many labor union people had feared , " said @entity0 legal analyst @entity51			2
the ruling stems from a decision by @entity6 lawmakers to classify home health care workers paid by @entity60 as state employees and require them to pay fees to the @entity63			1
the union exclusively bargains with the state over wages , hours and working conditions			0
the employees , most of whom were hired by individual patients and reimbursed through @entity60 , argued that they were being forced to subsidize the union 's efforts in violation of constitutional rights of free speech and free association			2
state officials argued that mandatory union representation increased wages and benefits , reduced employee turnover and improved training and supervision			0
justice @entity86 , writing for the conservative majority , said the practice was a clear violation of the @entity91			1
" if we accepted @entity6 ' argument , we would approve an unprecedented violation of the bedrock principle that , except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances , no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support , " @entity86 wrote			1
justice @entity103 wrote in her dissent that in terms of the 1977 ruling that allowed agency shops , there was no difference between the home health workers and more traditional state employees			1
labor union allies picked up on that line of reasoning			0
" the @entity1 's ruling is a serious concern for workers ' rights across the country -- employees whose job qualifications , evaluations , salaries , work hours , training , and wages are all controlled by the state are , in every sense of the word , public sector employees , " @entity115 , executive director of the @entity116 , said in a statement			0
" failure to recognize this fact , and to provide the collective bargaining rights that go along with it , will harm workers and families across the country , " @entity115 said			0
the union involved in the case , the @entity63 , said in a statement that the ruling " places at risk a system of consumer - directed home care in @entity6 that has proven successful in raising wages , providing affordable health care benefits , and increasing training			1
" but union president @entity152 said the effort to unionize workers would continue			0
" no court case is going to stand in the way of home care workers coming together to have a strong voice for good jobs and quality home care , " she said			1
@entity163 law professor @entity162 said the ruling " strikes a blow against efforts to address the serious problem of income inequality in this country			0
" " home care employees are among our lowest - paid workers , and this decision will make it harder for them to come together to improve conditions			2
" the conservative @entity176 , however , celebrated the ruling as a major victory			0
" this decision delivers a major blow to the coercive powers of government unions , " institute policy analyst @entity179 said in a statement			0
" the ruling frees thousands of home care and child care providers from financially assisting government unions that they disagree with			2
" @entity0 's @entity190 reported and wrote from @entity191 ; @entity192 reported and wrote from @entity193 .			0
