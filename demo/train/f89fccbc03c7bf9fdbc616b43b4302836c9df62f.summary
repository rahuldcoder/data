-- for a group of high - schoolers being framed for their friend 's murder , the characters on " @entity2 " sure put a lot of thought into their outfits			1
it 's like costume designer @entity11 says : why be conservative about hemlines and heel heights on a show where a teacher is dating a student and a drunk girl ca n't remember if she dug up her friend 's dead body ? " we always go down this whole list of things every time ( the producers ) call me out with , ' those heels are a little high , ' " said @entity11 , who has worked on the @entity21 series since its first season , which premiered in 2010			1
fall tv fashion : ' revenge ' viewers only have to wait until october 23 for the show 's anticipated @entity30 special			2
and @entity11 says fashion lovers are in for a treat when the third season returns			1
@entity35 , the queen of simple tank tops and tees , will really step up her game ; @entity40 's skirts are getting a little bit shorter ; @entity42 continues to push the envelope ; and a new , top - secret storyline influences @entity46 's wardrobe			1
but when you 're dealing with characters who routinely wind up with blood on their hands -- that 's literally and figuratively -- plucking looks off the runway is n't always an option			1
just a few episodes ago , @entity40 ( @entity56 ) was stabbed in the leg while wearing a pair of neon pink pants			0
line said her team had to " do a lot of driving " to find at least four identical pairs for multiple scenes and takes			0
the blood just would n't have shown up as well against blue jeans , she said			0
" i try not to make it inconvenient for ( my team ) , " @entity11 added , though she recently had to track down five of the same $ 150 shirt			1
@entity40 gets a drink spilled on her while wearing it in an upcoming episode			0
@entity11 said dressing main characters @entity35 , @entity46 , @entity42 and @entity40 like typical high school students would be boring , adding , you ca n't blame viewers for " wanting to go to some sort of fantasyland			1
" " one of the things that 's hilarious is that @entity11 , she 'll pick such amazing costumes that they 're , at times , hilariously inappropriate for what we 're doing , " said @entity79 , who plays @entity46 on the series			1
" our school outfits are outrageous			2
sometimes we 're all standing together in the hallways , and we 'll look around at all of our background actors who look like normal high school students			2
and we kind of make a joke , like , no wonder nobody talks to us in this school because we literally look so out of place			0
" never mind the disconnect between the main characters and the background actors , typically clad in pieces from @entity99 and @entity100 , @entity11 said			1
the costume designer can hardly believe @entity42 , @entity40 , @entity46 and @entity35 are best friends given their distinctive styles : " i always wonder why , fashionwise , they would even talk to each other			1
" @entity79 , whose character @entity46 dresses the preppiest of the bunch , says , " when you start out on a tv show ... the network really wants you to have a strict character style so that at any point in the show , your character is identifiable from the back side			1
... it 's really important on a show with three brunettes			2
" but as the characters evolve , so do their styles			0
" ( @entity46 is ) not that girl you were introduced to in the argyle sweater and the pearls in the pilot , " @entity11 said			1
the one thing that has stuck with @entity46 , however , is the skinny watch she always wears an inch or two above her wrist			1
" at the beginning of every day , i get to walk in and somebody hands me my watch and that 's how i know it 's @entity135 , " said @entity79			1
it was her idea for @entity46 to wear the timepiece in the first place			1
and that 's not the only way the actress ' style has influenced her character 's			2
" i dislike color in general , especially pastels , " @entity79 said			1
" i think the way ( @entity147 ) always compromises with me is , i love knee socks , like thigh high socks , in everyday life			0
and so whenever she gives me something that i 'm not happy about on top , she 's like , ' look , i 'll give you tights and boots			1
' " though , she said there is a bit of style envy when it comes to her costars			0
" whenever i walk into the costume fitting room , i 'll see something on a rack or on the floor and i 'll ooh and ahh over it , " she said			2
" and immediately @entity11 will say , ' no , that 's @entity42 's			1
' ( actress ) @entity170 ( @entity169 ) definitely , definitely has the most fun in terms of style on the show			0
she gets the coolest clothes			0
" line said she used to think that @entity42 , played by @entity169 , was the most fashionable of the girls , but now she just considers the character to have " schizophrenia fashion			0
" " one episode is stripes , there 's an episode where she 's a rockabilly			2
and then this one she looks like a flapper			0
literally , she 's so inconsistent			2
... the only thing that 's consistent is that she wears , like , 1,000 pounds of jewelry , " @entity11 said			1
the character popped up in the summer finale wearing a metallic blue , pleated leather skirt from @entity193 that line modified			0
" that 's not in			2
but it 's going to be , " she said			2
" these kids do become ( fashion icons )			0
" and @entity200 knows it			0
shortly after the singer / actress / designer tweeted in june about sending the show " some @ @entity205 goodies , " @entity11 said she received a box with " a crap load of stuff			1
" the costume designer acknowledges that many teens are likely not wearing @entity212 wedges , @entity214 jeans or @entity216 sweaters to school , which is why she makes an effort " to stay within some sort of a realistic price point			1
" " ' @entity221 ' put tv fashion on the map			0
you had ' @entity225 ' and then you had ' @entity221			0
' but what 's really good about ' @entity2 ' is , 75 % of the items are attainable			1
... you can save up for that @entity229 top			2
you can save up for that @entity233 dress , " she said			0
that 's part of the reason she said she loves featuring @entity239 's designs on the show			0
and @entity239 told @entity0 that the brand 's unofficial partnership with the series has certainly been beneficial			0
during the show 's second season , @entity239 said one of the characters referenced her red minibag by name			0
" from there we noticed a definite uptick in sales , " she added			0
@entity239 said her fall offerings include " a lot of embossed , faux python " handbags , " great outerwear pieces " and a ton of " rich burgundy and purple " -- so do n't be surprised to see such trends show up on " @entity2 " this fall			2
line said it did n't take her long to realize what the series was capable of , having heard from viewers who watch each episode twice : first for the plot points , and then again for the fashion			0
after all , it 's not surprising that @entity11 says she has " creative freedom " on set			1
anyone who can glue craft pom poms on a brown maxiskirt from a rental house , pair it with a pink blouse and make it look fashion - forward deserves at least that much .			0
