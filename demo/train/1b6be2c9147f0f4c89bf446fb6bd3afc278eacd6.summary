editor 's note : @entity2 is an actor , author , director , satirist , musician , radio host , playwright , fine artist and record label owner who is the voice of a variety of regular characters on " @entity14 , " most notably mr. @entity15 , @entity16 and insufferable neighbor @entity17			1
@entity2 says the @entity18 is n't getting actively involved in protecting @entity19 from flooding			1
( @entity21 ) -- i spent much of this month in my adopted hometown of @entity19 , @entity24			1
uncharacteristically for august , the streets and restaurants and galleries and music clubs were largely full and throbbing with energy			0
there are hubs of entrepreneurs all over town trying to invent the future			0
and thankfully , mayor @entity36 's term is only months away from its end			0
between my weeks in the @entity19 , i joined some local folks in traipsing up to the @entity39 to share the news of @entity19 with interested outsiders			1
one talked about the progress in rebuilding homes			2
another discussed the reform of the public - school system , the decoupling of the schools from a centralized board , resulting in the city becoming the leader in charter - school enrollment			0
a third talked about the move to neighborhood medical clinics , an effort to replace the hospital beds missing in the flooding 's wake			0
a fourth reported the good economic statistics , marred only by the continuing shortage in affordable rental housing ( 80,000 units were whacked by the flood )			0
and a fifth discussed the citizen activism that is helping , along with a determined @entity68 attorney ( who 's just sent rep. @entity69 and his brother @entity70 to jail ) , to clean up local politics			0
after all , it was @entity75 pols , not @entity19 ones , who got snagged in a scheme involving black - market kidneys			1
wish we 'd thought of that			0
and all transpiring under a shadow , one made all too evident early last week when the city experienced a collective shudder as the spinning cyclonic shape of @entity86 appeared on tv screens			0
@entity19 , hit so hard by what so many ( including president @entity88 in his sunday interview with the local newspaper ) still see fit to describe , mistakenly , as a natural disaster , is making remarkable progress , while the agency that so disastrously failed at building a protective system mandated by @entity96 -- the @entity97 -- may be making some of the same mistakes in rebuilding that system			1
and the @entity18 , for the second consecutive administration , seems not to care			0
me ? i 'm a humorist , a comic actor , a sometime musician - filmmaker - novelist - blogger			0
what the hell do i know about what happened to the city i love ? since the levees collapsed , i 've been reading the local newspaper , the @entity108 , watching and listening to the local media , which , post-disaster , have rediscovered their mission to make local news more than a recitation of the previous day 's murders , car crashes and celebrity misbehaviors			0
while the national media packed up and moved away after the initial orgasm of anger at @entity119 , the local media reported something remarkable : the @entity97 was claiming that the flooding was due to the " overtopping " of its levees and floodwalls , while two teams of pro-bono forensic investigators were finding evidence that no overtopping had occurred			1
as the @entity97 started denigrating these investigators , they kept digging , and kept coming up with the real story , available now for all to see ( though all too few have ) as the @entity133 report from the @entity134 and the @entity136 report from @entity137			1
their conclusions : the " hurricane protection system " built by the @entity97 had serious design and construction flaws , baked into the system over 40 years under administrations of both parties , that caused catastrophic failure in more than 50 locations under storm surge conditions markedly less than the system was advertised to withstand			1
you and i , federal taxpayers , had paid to flood @entity19			2
since the @entity88 administration took office , the @entity97 has : announced that one part of the new " system " will be built using a " technically not superior " solution , because of funding problems ; and , defying a @entity96 mandate , delivered a report supposed to offer a post- 2011 plan for so - called category 5 storm protection 20 months late and lacking a specific plan , offering only a menu of possible options			1
it 's almost as if the @entity97 is inviting someone else to do the job			2
a @entity19 architect , @entity169 , has been convening a group of local architects and planners and engineers and their @entity175 colleagues to mine the eight centuries of collective wisdom of the @entity175 about the challenge of living with water			2
the resulting plans , published as the " @entity175 dialogues , " make for inspiring and depressing reading ; inspiring because they offer a vision of a city that has stopped fighting a war against water and has learned to use water both to enhance value and to enhance safety , depressing because there is so clearly no federal impetus , from the president on down , to embrace such a new approach			0
president @entity88 , who has mainly limited his comments about @entity19 to feel - good boilerplate , did pledge to make good on president @entity200 's promise on that eerie , floodlit night in a deserted @entity201 in 2005 , to rebuild @entity19 better and stronger			1
but he has yet to actively intervene to make sure @entity19 gets state - of - the - art flood protection and robust and timely coastal wetland reconstruction			2
like president @entity200 , president @entity88 so far seems to be acting as if just saying it makes it so			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : there is much good news in @entity19 , but still problems
he notes report that @entity97 levee design and construction led to *breach*
@entity2 says there may be flaws with the @entity222 ' levee rebuilding
he says @entity88 is ignoring problem , as @entity200 did previously
