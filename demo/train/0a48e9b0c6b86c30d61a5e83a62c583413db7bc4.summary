@entity0 -- with approval in hand to arm and train @entity6 rebels to fight the @entity8 terror group , president @entity2 said thursday the plan keeps with " the key principle " of @entity12 strategy : no @entity12 combat troops on the ground			1
" the @entity12 troops deployed to @entity19 do not and will not have a combat mission , " he said in televised remarks from the @entity17			2
" their mission is to advise and assist our partners on the ground			0
... we can destroy @entity8 without having our troops fight another ground war in the @entity27			2
" @entity2 said more than 40 countries , including @entity30 nations , have offered assistance in the battle against the @entity33 in @entity19 and @entity6 , which calls itself the @entity33			1
the developments came as @entity8 advanced its grip on portions of @entity6 and @entity19 , seizing 16 predominantly @entity38 villages near the @entity40 border			1
the move by @entity8 was just one in a series of developments that saw new reports of atrocities emerge and the release of a video of a captive @entity50 journalist criticizing the @entity12 and @entity50 governments			1
citing the @entity54 terror group 's brutality , from beheading civilians -- including @entity12 journalists @entity56 and @entity58 -- to the mass execution of its opponents , @entity2 said the @entity12 will not back down			1
" with their barbaric murder of two @entity12 , these terrorists thought they could frighten us or intimidate us or cause us to shrink from the world , " @entity2 said			2
" but today they are learning the same hard lesson of petty tyrants and terrorists who have gone before , as @entity12 we do not give into fear			2
when you harm our citizens , when you threaten the @entity12 , when you threaten our allies , it does n't frighten us			0
" the question now appears to be not if , but when the @entity12 will strike @entity8 in its stronghold in northern @entity6			1
the @entity12 military has everything it needs to strike @entity8 targets in @entity6 , a plan that officials told @entity1 is still waiting on @entity2 's signoff			1

for weeks , @entity12 intelligence and military targeting specialists have been working around the clock on a list of potential targets in @entity6			1
the list is expected to be shown to @entity2 one more time , @entity12 military officials said			1
an analysis of the risks of bombing inside @entity6 will be included , as well as an assessment of how the destruction of the targets could degrade @entity8 , they said			2
carrying out airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity6 would be a continuation of the @entity12 military operation in @entity19 , where @entity12 airstrikes are being carried out against the group			1
@entity12 airstrikes on thursday struck an @entity8 training camp southeast of @entity137 , the group 's stronghold in @entity19 , the @entity12 military said			1
