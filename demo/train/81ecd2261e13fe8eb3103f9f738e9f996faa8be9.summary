she was never charged in that shooting			1
@entity16 was charged this weekend with capital murder in friday 's on - campus shooting deaths of her colleagues			1
she could face the death penalty			2
the state police report in the 1986 shooting , released by the office of @entity27 rep. @entity26 , @entity12 , gives an account similar to a @entity30 story published on december 8 , 2008			1
@entity26 was district attorney at the time ; staffers said he was in the @entity33 on sunday and unable to comment on the case			0
earlier this weekend , @entity11 police said records from that shooting were missing , and that the department 's log indicated the shooting was accidental			1
however , police chief @entity41 said he did n't agree with the @entity30 's account			1
the @entity30 's story stated that @entity16 asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12 - gauge shotgun and that @entity16 -- then known as @entity9 -- accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon			1
the article cited then - police chief @entity50 as the source			1
according to the state police report released sunday , @entity11 police told state police that " indications were that @entity9 had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon " when it went off , shooting her brother , @entity10 , in the chest			1
but , @entity41 said saturday , " it is a far different story i believe than what was reported back then			0
i can not tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time			0
" an officer then involved in the case who is still working for the department told him that @entity16 shot her brother during an argument , @entity41 said			1
the officer said @entity16 allegedly fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone , argued with her brother , shot him and then fired another round in the home before fleeing , according to @entity41			1
@entity41 said the teen was arrested after pointing a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an attempt to get the driver to stop , but it drove on			0

he said her mother was at the time a member of the @entity92			2
in a telephone call with @entity0 , @entity50 , now 87 and retired , denied ever calling in the order			0
he said detectives including lead investigator capt. @entity96 -- who has since died -- had interviewed @entity16 and her mother , @entity97 , who is identified in the state police report as @entity100			1
@entity96 told him that the shooting appeared accidental and the two men agreed she should be released to her mother , @entity50 said			1
a request was then filed with @entity26 's office to conduct an inquiry , but @entity26 never did so , he said			2
the state police report , however , said that @entity96 met with a state police investigator and determined that " due to the testimony of the members of the @entity112 family , and in particular the testimony of @entity100 , relevant to the facts concerning the death of @entity112 that no further investigation ... was warranted , " the report concludes			1
@entity112 's death was listed as accidental and the investigation was concluded			1
@entity26 spokesman @entity118 told @entity0 the state police and medical examiner concluded the death was accidental , and an autopsy was also conducted			1
" the investigative reports ... did not recommend any further action , " he said in an e-mail			0
those reports were turned over to state and local authorities , including the district attorney 's office , he said			2
@entity16 's mother witnessed the shooting , the state police report said			1
investigators waited 11 days to interview @entity16 and her parents because of their " highly emotional state " following the shooting , according to the report			1
in the december 17 , 1986 , interview , @entity16 told authorities she " thought it would be a good idea if she learned how to load the shotgun in the house , " according to the state police report			1
the young woman told police she was concerned for her own safety after the family home was broken into , although she previously had been afraid of the gun			0
she said she got the gun and loaded shells into it , but was unable to get them out			0
@entity16 said that while she was attempting to unload the weapon on her bed , it went off			2
she then took it downstairs to ask for help in unloading it			0
she asked her brother , she said , and he told her to point the gun up instead of carrying it beside her leg			0
her brother was walking across the kitchen between her and her mother , she said			2
she started to raise the gun , and " someone said something to her , " she recalled in the report			0
she turned and the gun went off			0
" @entity9 thought that she had ruined the kitchen but was not aware of the fact that she had struck her brother , " the report said			2
she fled , and told police she thought she had dropped the gun as she ran away			0
" she can not recall anything else until she subsequently saw her mother at the police station , " the report said			1
the report does not reference any other shots fired besides the one in @entity16 's bedroom and the shot that struck her brother			1
@entity16 's father was not home at the time			1
he told police he had had a disagreement with his daughter " about a comment she had made " before he left to go shopping			0

@entity16 was not trained to use the gun , he said			2
@entity16 's mother said that when her daughter came downstairs and asked for help in unloading the gun , she told her not to point it at anyone , and that her daughter turned and the gun went off			1
the woman told police she did not hear the shotgun fire earlier in her daughter 's bedroom and " believed the house was relatively well soundproofed and that such a discharge would not necessarily be heard on another floor of the house			2
" @entity50 acknowledged that an argument had occurred during the shooting and said that the other shots , including one fired into the ceiling , did not appear aimed at anyone			2
he also recalled that @entity16 had fled the scene			2
but , he said , he could not remember what he had told the newspaper in reference to the case or why details , including the argument , were not reported			0
he said @entity16 's mother had worked for the personnel board and at one point was assigned to the police department			1
but he rejected as " laughable " any suggestions that the suspect 's mother might have influenced their handling of the case			2
" there was no cover - up , " @entity50 said			0
" absolutely no cover - up and no missing records			0
the records were all there when i left			0
where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs subsequent , i do n't know			0
" @entity11 mayor @entity243 announced sunday an effort to locate all materials associated with the shooting			0
" the @entity247 will conduct a thorough audit of all its records to identify if there were deficits in its past recordkeeping process , " @entity243 said			0
" it is important to note that in 1986 , police records were created and maintained manually , which complicates their review and retrieval			2
" the @entity11 shooting resurfaced after @entity259 - trained @entity16 was charged in friday 's shooting in @entity261			1
@entity4 police chief @entity262 said saturday that @entity16 was attending a faculty meeting on the third floor of the sciences building friday afternoon when she brandished a gun and shot six colleagues , killing three			1

however , authorities would n't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting			0
