@entity0 -- republicans wrested control of the @entity7 from president @entity8 and the @entity9 this week , and their next goal is to take the @entity7 , their leader in the @entity4 said thursday			1
if the @entity5 want to achieve their goals of repealing health care reform , ending bailouts , cutting spending and reducing the size of government , " the only way to do all these things it is to put someone in the @entity7 who wo n't veto any of these things , " sen. @entity11 , @entity12 , said in a speech at the conservative @entity14			1
@entity26 made clear that his party sees little room for compromise with @entity8 and the @entity9 , saying voters were calling for a change in direction , rather than a middle ground			1
" we can hope the president will start listening to the electorate after tuesday 's election			2
but we ca n't plan on it , " said @entity26 , who was recently quoted as saying his goal is to ensure that @entity8 will be a one - term president			1
" i do n't want the president to fail			0
i want him to change			0
" in an interview with @entity1 later thursday , @entity26 reiterated that it is @entity8 who has to shift direction , saying : " if the president will simply listen to the @entity49 people , we can do some business			1
" the @entity5 failed to capture control of the @entity4 this week , leaving @entity26 the minority leader , but they 're riding high on a gain of at least six seats there and 10 times that many in the @entity7			1
" for the past two years , @entity58 lawmakers chose to ignore the @entity49 people , so on tuesday the @entity49 people chose new lawmakers , " @entity26 said			0
" the @entity7 has a choice : they can change course or they can double down on a vision of government that the @entity49 people have roundly rejected , " he said			2
in response , @entity7 press secretary @entity65 told reporters thursday that voters wanted politicians in @entity0 to work together to solve the nation 's problems , not continue taking intractable positions to score political points			0
" you 're certainly not going to make progress in a divided government saying ' my way or the highway , ' " @entity65 said , noting that @entity8 has called @entity26 and other congressional leaders to a november 18 meeting to discuss legislative priorities			1
consensus on issues " is not going to be 100 percent of what anybody wants , " @entity65 added			0
in his speech , @entity26 conceded that the elections were not about the @entity5			2
" they were about the @entity9			0
they got a report card			1
they got an f , " he said			0
" @entity49 voted for change in the last two elections because of two long and difficult wars and because they hoped a changing of the guard would stabilize the economy and get @entity49 moving again , " @entity26 added			1
but , he said , " @entity58 leaders used the crisis of the moment to advance an agenda @entity49 did n't ask for and could n't afford			0
" in particular , @entity26 lambasted the health care reform bill passed by @entity9 after a bitter legislative fight that lasted more than a year			1
" health care legislation is the worst bill that was passed in my time in the @entity4 , " said @entity26 , who was elected in 1984			1
he called the @entity112 reform bill intended to bring transparency and consumer protections to the financial services industry almost as bad			0
@entity26 has promised a non-stop effort to repeal the health care bill , in an apparent strategy to force democrats to record votes in favor of the measure that can be cited in the 2012 election campaign			2
with @entity9 still controlling the @entity4 , the chances of a repeal making it through @entity126 are considered highly unlikely			2
even if that happened , @entity8 's veto power adds another formidable barrier against a repeal measure succeeding			0
@entity65 said he doubted that @entity8 would have to veto a repeal effort , saying : " i honestly do n't think it will come to that			2
" he noted that exit polling showed half the voters tuesday supported the health care bill , and that most people who cited the measure as an important issue supported the @entity9			0
