-- you 've seen this person			0
maybe you 've even been this person			0
we 're talking about someone shuffling along a sidewalk or through a shopping mall , so entranced by the phone in their hands that they bump into people or almost get run over			0
yes , this behavior can be annoying			0
now we have scientific evidence it can be dangerous			0
a new study has found that people who type or read on their phones while walking are less likely to look at their surroundings , keep their balance or walk in a straight line			1
this may seem obvious to anyone who has been jostled by an oblivious text messager			0
but researchers at @entity25 's @entity24 say theirs is the first study to measure how typing text on a cellphone impacts " gait performance " and kinematics , or the study of body motion			1
" texting , and to a lesser extent reading , on your mobile phone affects your ability to walk and balance , " said @entity34 , an honorary senior fellow at the @entity24 and the lead author of the study			1
" this may impact the safety of people who text and walk at the same time			1
" the perils of texting while driving are well documented			0
but texting while walking has its own pitfalls			1
in january 2011 a woman fell headlong into a fountain at a @entity51 mall while tapping on her phone , a blunder that was captured by a security camera and was widely mocked on @entity55			0
last october an @entity57 man was struck by a car while texting on his phone and walking in the middle of a highway ( authorities said he also was drinking at the time )			2
and a nationwide study by @entity65 last year found that the number of pedestrians treated in @entity69 emergency rooms for injuries related to phone use while walking has more than doubled since 2005			2
in the new @entity25 study , scientists studied the effect of phone use while walking in 26 healthy people			1
each person walked in a line over a distance of about 28 feet while doing one of three tasks : walking without the use of a phone , reading text on a phone , or typing the sentence , " the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog			2
" their bodies ' movements were evaluated using a three - dimensional movement analysis system			0
researchers found that texting , and to a lesser extent reading , affected movements while walking			2
when participants were texting , they walked more slowly , deviated more from a straight line and moved their neck less than when reading on their phones			1
the study was published wednesday in @entity100 , a peer - reviewed online journal that publishes reports on primary research from a variety of scientific disciplines .			1

study : texting while walking can pose a safety risk
people who type on their phones while walking are less likely to keep their balance
