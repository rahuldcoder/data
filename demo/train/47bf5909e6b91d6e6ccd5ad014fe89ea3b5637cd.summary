@entity1 has officially been eradicated from the @entity2 , the @entity0 declared friday , even amid fresh concerns about the deadly virus in places like @entity6 and @entity7			1
the @entity9 health agency cleared the @entity2 for @entity1 because 42 days had passed since tests came back negative on the last person with the disease and there have been no other cases since			1
the @entity0 credited the @entity17 country 's leadership and effective coordination , including steps to monitor those with the disease and the people they had been in contact with , for the milestone			0
this marks the seventh @entity1 outbreak in the @entity2 since the virus was first identified in 1976 , the agency said			1
the @entity2 has had 38 confirmed and 28 probable reported @entity1 cases in recent months			1
of those , 49 people -- including eight health care workers -- have died			0
the @entity2 's @entity1 cases are n't related to those in hard - hit @entity36 , though they come at a time when many around the continent are dealing with the same disease			1
the @entity2 joins other countries , such as @entity41 and @entity42 , that the @entity0 has declared @entity1 - free in recent weeks			1
this good news notwithstanding , @entity1 remains a very real threat elsewhere , particularly in @entity36			0
and in some places , things are getting worse			0
that includes @entity7 , where the first case of @entity1 came from a 2Â½ - year - old girl who 'd crossed the border			2
then there was a 70 - year - old grand imam who came from @entity53 to @entity54 , where he died on october 27 , prompting authorities to try to track down hundreds who were in contact with him			0
@entity9 @entity60 ban ki - moon called " the new trail of transmissions in @entity7 ... a cause of deep concern , " announcing that @entity0 director - general dr. @entity61 will head to the country to assist officials there			1
" we must smother this little fire , this little smoke before it gets out of control , " @entity68 said			0
" ... i am confident that , if we work together as one , we will be able to bring this outbreak under control			0
" six @entity1 cases have been reported so far in @entity7			1
contrast that with @entity79 , @entity6 and @entity53 , home to the vast majority of more than 15,000 @entity1 cases and over 5,000 deaths in recent months , according to a @entity0 report out friday			1
@entity87 president @entity86 plans to spend november 28 - 30 in that stricken region -- including a visit to @entity53 , a former @entity87 colony -- to address how to combat the virus , the @entity85 announced friday			2
@entity87 is giving more than $ 40 million to set up @entity1 treatment centers in @entity53 , as well as to send medical and related equipment to that and other @entity36 nations			2
yet that 's just a fraction of what 's been requested to help fight the disease			0
the @entity9 this year launched a $ 1 billion campaign to fight @entity1 , but so far , it has fallen well short of that goal			2
@entity9 's fast - track ebola fund falls woefully short @entity9 under - secretary - general @entity102 told @entity104 's @entity103 on thursday that he is " cautiously optimistic " that @entity1 will be brought under control , pointing , for example , to successes containing the disease in @entity79 and increased awareness in some of the hardest - hit areas			1
but he also said that " infection rates are increasing exponentially " in parts of @entity6 , particularly its capital of @entity114			0
the @entity9 official said the future rests in part on what and how much the international community does to help corral the virus			0
talking about @entity114 , the former @entity6 trade minister said , " if you look at the spike in the capital , we can not afford one minute of complacence , whether locally or internationally			0
" @entity68 echoed this view friday for all areas now battling @entity1 , saying " we must maintain our vigilance " given that for all the places where the outbreak appears to be stabilizing , new cases are still popping up elsewhere			2
but if the international community , local leaders and the residents of @entity36 do their part , @entity133 said , there 's hope that @entity1 can be beaten			0
" if we continue to accelerate our response , " the @entity9 leader said , " we can contain and end the outbreak by the middle of next year			1

@entity9 leader says the @entity1 outbreak could be over by the middle of 2015
@entity0 chief heading to @entity7 , where there have been new @entity1 transmissions
there have been no @entity1 cases in the @entity2 in 42 days
other nations like @entity79 , @entity6 and @entity53 are still trying to contain the virus
