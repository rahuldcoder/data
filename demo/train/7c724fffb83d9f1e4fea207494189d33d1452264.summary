after days of turmoil , @entity1 's president , prime minister and @entity3 have stood down , leaving the troubled @entity7 nation without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict			1
president @entity12 's resignation thursday came after @entity14 rebels kidnapped his chief of staff , seized control of key government buildings in the capital , @entity19 , and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out wednesday			1
the chaos in @entity1 is cause for concern far beyond the country 's borders			1
for the @entity29 and its allies , @entity1 's government has been a key ally in the fight against @entity33 , the @entity1 - based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at @entity37 magazine @entity36			1
for the moment , uncertainty rules			0
beyond it yawns the prospect of a political vacuum and growing sectarian rift that terror groups such as @entity45 could exploit			0
@entity46 , a senior analyst at @entity47 , told @entity5 that unless @entity12 is reinstated , the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim			1
" our forecast is really civil war in @entity1 because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas , " she said			1
who is in charge right now really depends on where in @entity1 you are , she said			1
the @entity14 -- @entity64 who have long felt marginalized in the majority @entity66 country -- have taken control of @entity19 and the northern provinces of @entity70 and @entity71			2
but there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in @entity1 , particularly in the south , where there 's a long - running secessionist movement , and in the oil - rich province of @entity81 to the east of @entity19			1
" this really creates a situation where even if the @entity14 keep control over @entity19 , they have little chance of taking control of the whole country , " said @entity83			2
" we expect to see armed resistance			0
" it 's possible that @entity12 , himself a southerner , could rescind his resignation and put a @entity98 initiative for a negotiated transition of power back on track			0
but that seems unlikely at present			0
according to the national news agency @entity104 , @entity1 's @entity103 is due to hold an extraordinary session sunday , called by @entity106			1
analysts suggest that because there 's no vice president , the speaker could be next in the line of succession , taking on the role of acting president			2
he 's close to former president @entity115 , who clung to power until being forced out by international pressure two years ago			2
despite their takeover of @entity19 , it 's unclear whether the @entity14 really want to take charge of the country			1
the group more likely wanted @entity12 to remain in power as a figurehead behind whom they could pull the strings , without having to take on the burdensome business of governance , said @entity83			0
under wednesday 's failed peace deal , the @entity12 government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country 's constitution to give the @entity14 more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the president 's kidnapped aide			1
the government only finally got parliamentary approval in december , said @entity29 - based @entity1 analyst @entity145			1
@entity12 's resignation seems to be a recognition of the fact that he wo n't be able to lead the country as he wishes because of the @entity14 takeover , she said			1
the @entity14 are @entity64 from northern @entity1 who make up about 30 % of the population			1
they 've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the @entity45			0
at the beginning of 2014 , they won a series of battles close to the @entity160 border			0
and in september , @entity14 fighters suddenly descended on @entity19 , where they took over government buildings , the main airport and a share of power			2
in the past week , they 've taken it to another level			0
although they have been fighting @entity45 , they are no friend to the @entity29			0
one of the main slogans of this historically @entity173 - backed group is " @entity174			0
" the @entity14 have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former president @entity115 , said @entity83			1
this facilitated the @entity14 ' southward expansion , but the alliance is fragile , she said , not least because @entity115 in the past waged military campaigns against the @entity14			2
@entity184 's @entity1 affiliate @entity45 is perhaps the best - known group internationally			1
it first emerged in @entity160 in 2002 , but thanks to the efforts of @entity160 authorities was a mostly a spent force by 2005 , according to analysis from @entity190			0
it re-emerged , reinvigorated , in @entity1 in 2009 after the @entity160 outfit merged with a @entity1 @entity33 counterpart			2
besides battling the @entity1 government and @entity14 , it has been involved in international terror attacks , including the failed 2009 attempt to bring down an airliner over @entity197			1
the @entity198 is also a powerful group in @entity1 -- in the shape of the @entity200 -- and is well represented in the transitional government			2
it loathes the @entity14 and has its own militias			2
the fighting in @entity1 also provides an opening to @entity205 , which is keen to outflank @entity33 and prove itself the true defender of the faith			2
in november , @entity205 leader @entity208 called on @entity1 @entity66 to resist the @entity14			1
there are also a number of heavily armed rural tribes that will fight for control over their territories			0
while in power , @entity12 and the government of prime minister @entity216 have been trying to fight @entity45 on the ground and also have authorized @entity29 drone strikes in the country against terror targets			1
as part of those efforts , the @entity29 has several hundred @entity29 diplomats and military personnel in @entity1			2
but the @entity29 @entity226 has been on reduced staffing since september			0
the @entity14 have publicly said they oppose @entity29 drone strikes and @entity29 involvement in @entity1			1
there are currently no talks with the @entity14 , but there are discussions about whether to talk to them , according to @entity29 officials			2
multiple policy options are being considered , the officials said , though there is no consensus yet about how to proceed			0
" the safety and security of @entity29 personnel is our top priority in @entity1 , " @entity240 spokeswoman @entity239 said			0
" we are evaluating the security situation on the ground on an ongoing basis			0
we call on all parties to abide by their public commitments to ensure the security of the diplomatic community , including our personnel			0
" @entity254 , the @entity1 analyst , said she did n't see an immediate need to pull @entity29 personnel out of @entity1			1
" i think @entity1 is safe at the time being , " she told @entity5 's @entity257			1
" the @entity14 have been in charge for a while			0
they have popular committees all over the capital of @entity19 , and they 've been running the security show			0
" i do , however , want to say that the @entity29 might need to start talking to the @entity14			0
and if the @entity29 are talking to @entity173 in back channels , they need to do the same with the @entity14			0
" since @entity12 's resignation , there has been a lot of anger against the @entity14 in parts of the country , said @entity83 , the @entity47 analyst			1
while @entity12 was n't able to unify the country while in power , she said , since the @entity14 takeover of @entity19 , he has become the popular symbol of @entity277 sentiment across southern and central @entity1			1
many there are calling for his return , she said			0
a chief flashpoint for popular anger may be the central @entity81 province , she said			0
there have already been some low - level confrontations , and tribes are mobilizing in the area			0
large - scale protests have also been seen in @entity288 , the main seaport in the country 's south , where the current chaos plays into the hands of the secession movement			0
