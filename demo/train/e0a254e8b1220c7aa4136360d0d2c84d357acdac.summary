@entity0 -- a mandatory 21 - day quarantine imposed by @entity0 and @entity3 on health care workers returning from @entity5 after treating @entity7 patients caught local and federal officials by surprise and spurred a heated debate on handling the spread of the virus			1
the policy of isolating medical personnel and others arriving from ebola - affected countries zones was abruptly implemented friday by the governors of @entity0 and @entity3 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
the announcement came one day after a @entity0 doctor who treated patients in @entity23 became the first @entity7 case diagnosed in the city and the fourth in the @entity27			1
the mandate came as a surprise to the federal @entity30 in @entity31 , according to a federal official familiar with the situation			0
" they 're not happy , " the official said of the @entity35			0
" these two governors said , ' take this , federal government			0
' they 're very worried we wo n't be able to get physicians or nurses to go ( to countries affected by the @entity7 outbreak )			1
" should health care workers be quarantined ? a @entity0 official called more stringent screening " a real stunner			1
" " they did this without consulting the city , and that 's not a good thing , " the official said of @entity18 and @entity19			0
" they did n't let anyone know in advance			0
" both officials spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity60 will require " high - risk individuals who have had direct contact with an individual infected with the ebola virus while in @entity65 , @entity66 or @entity23 " to undergo a mandatory 21 - day home quarantine , according to a press release from governor @entity70 's office released on friday			1
on saturday , the @entity35 said that it sets the baseline recommended standards , but state and local officials have the prerogative to set tighter policies			0
" when it comes to the federal standards set by the @entity35 , we will consider any measures that we believe have the potential to make the @entity27 people safer , " the @entity35 said in a statement			0
nurse worried about mandatory quarantines the two - state policy was implemented the same day that nurse @entity87 landed at @entity88 in @entity3 after working with @entity89 in treating @entity7 patients in @entity66			1
@entity87 , in an op - ed piece in the @entity92 , wrote that she was ordered placed in quarantine at a hospital , where she tested negative in a preliminary test for @entity7			1
still , hospital officials told her she must remain under mandatory quarantine for 21 days			0
@entity87 wrote that she was held at the airport and questioned by various health workers after her flight landed about 1 p.m. at first , her temperature -- taken with forehead scanner -- was 98 degrees			2
hours later , her cheeks flushed with anger over being held without explanation , another scanner check recorded her temperature as 101 degrees , she wrote			0
@entity87 eventually got a police escort , sirens blaring , to a hospital , when her temperature was again checked in an outdoor tent			0
on the oral thermometer , her temperature was recorded as 98.6			0
and she tested negative for @entity7 , she wrote in the @entity115 newspaper			1
a second test by the @entity35 confirmed the finding			0
in a statement released saturday , @entity89 , or @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , said there was a " notable lack of clarity " about the guidelines released by @entity0 and @entity3			1
" we are attempting to clarify the details of the protocols with each state 's departments of health to gain a full understanding of their requirements and implications , " @entity89 said			1
" while measures to protect public health are of paramount importance , they must be balanced against the rights of health workers returning from fighting the @entity7 outbreak in @entity5 to fair and reasonable treatment and the full disclosure of information to them , along with information about intended courses of action from local and state health authorities			1
" @entity0 health commissioner dr. @entity145 is concerned that the mandatory quarantine will discourage doctors and nurses from volunteering to take care of @entity7 patients in @entity5 , according to her spokeswoman			1
" we just want to make sure we do n't inadvertently discourage volunteers who are going to @entity5 to help control this epidemic , " said health department spokeswoman @entity152			0
the new airport screening procedures require anyone who had direct contact with @entity7 patients to remain in quarantine for up to three weeks			2
in addition , people with a travel history to the affected regions but with no direct contact with @entity7 patients will be " actively monitored ... and , if necessary , quarantined , " according to the new policy			2
" this is not the time to take chances , " @entity18 said friday			0
" this adjustment in increasing the screening procedures is necessary			0
... i think public safety and public health have to be balanced and i think this policy does that			0
" new federal policy starts monday the new guidelines add to the federal policy requiring all travelers coming to the @entity27 from @entity7 - affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days , starting monday			1
already , such travelers landing at five @entity27 airports -- @entity0 's @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity3 's @entity88 , @entity187 's @entity186 and @entity188 in @entity31 -- must go through enhanced screening			2
@entity7 has killed nearly 5,000 people , mostly in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity23 , in what health officials call the worst outbreak of the disease in history			1
on friday , the @entity196 said @entity197 , a @entity115 nurse , had been declared free of the ebola virus			2
public health experts say there 's plenty of scientific evidence indicating that there 's very little chance that a random person will get @entity7 , unless he or she is in very close contact -- close enough to share bodily fluids -- with someone who has it			1
how the ebola virus spreads @entity0 ebola patient 's fiancee cleared on thursday , a @entity0 doctor who had traveled on a humanitarian mission to @entity23 , where he had treated @entity7 patients , developed symptoms and has been hospitalized in @entity218			1
dr. @entity219 , 33 , is in isolation at @entity221 in @entity0			1
he arrived back from @entity23 on october 17 and had limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them , according to officials			1
on the same day @entity18 and @entity19 announced the new guidelines , @entity7 survivor @entity226 donated plasma to @entity219 , said the charity sim			1
@entity226 was one of the first two @entity27 diagnosed with the ebola virus			0
she was successfully treated at @entity230 in @entity31 in august			0
@entity219 's fiancee , @entity231 , had been under quarantine at @entity221 , but was cleared and has no symptoms , according to @entity152 , a city health department spokeswoman			1
on saturday night , @entity231 returned home to the hazmat - cleaned apartment she shares with @entity219 in @entity218			2
@entity231 's family members have not been in physical contact with her or @entity219 since his return from @entity5 , according to a family statement			2
two friends of @entity219 are under quarantine outside the hospital and are being monitored , though they feel healthy			2
dr. @entity244 , deputy commissioner for disease control at the city health department , held a news conference outside said the woman would be under quarantine for 21 days and that she is healthy			2
she is not allowed visitors and groceries will be delivered to her apartment			0
@entity219 's activities , which include riding in subways and cabs , have sparked a sharp public debate about how to deal with people who have traveled to @entity5 countries ravaged by the disease			2
on saturday , one of the places visited by the @entity219 , the gutter bowling alley in @entity264 , reopened after extensive decontamination work			2
and @entity0 mayor @entity266 dined on meatballs at a @entity218 restaurant visited by the doctor			0
should the focus of @entity27 policy be to do everything to prevent anyone who has visited the most ravaged regions from entering the @entity27 , even if it discourages health care workers from going there ? some @entity27 lawmakers , such as rep. @entity279 , favor a strict three - week quarantine			1
( that duration is significant because it takes anywhere from two to 21 days from the time a person is exposed to @entity7 to when he or she shows symptoms of it ; if more time than that passes without symptoms , a person is considered @entity7 - free			2
) " in return from being allowed to come back into the country from a place where a deadly disease is endemic , you 'd have to enter a quarantine facility and be supervised for 21 days , " the @entity290 @entity289 told @entity1			0
but other officials say while that policy could prevent some cases of @entity7 in the @entity27 over the short term , it could backfire if highly trained @entity27 doctors have less incentive to travel to @entity5 to fight the disease			1
" these individuals who are going there to serve are the people who will end this crisis , " @entity266 said			0
" we ca n't have the illusion that we can turn away from it and some day it may end			0
if we took that attitude , this would be a truly devastating global crisis			0
" complete coverage on @entity7 @entity1 's @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , dr. @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 and @entity321 contributed to this report .			1
