-- as any bike lover can attest , cycling has numerous advantages over driving ; it 's cheaper , healthier , and when there 's traffic , the ride can be considerably quicker			1
what cars bring to the table is storage space			0
it 's difficult to imagine moving house , schlepping groceries or making deliveries by bicycle , but in a handful of cities , residents and businesses are choosing to do just that			1
nine years ago , @entity22 launched @entity23 , a bicycle courier service in @entity25 , @entity26 -- a city often deemed the country 's most bike - friendly			1
" when we started , there were a few companies in @entity25 doing what we do , but they were still using shoulder bags , and delivering small documents			0
we found these cargo bikes that operated like a small van , only they were much more flexible and faster , " he recalls			1
today , his fleet includes bikes that can haul up to 250kg ( 550 pounds )			2
last year , @entity23 started subcontracting for larger delivery firms , including @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			2
" traveling that last mile or two to deliver a package can be a bit of a headache for delivery companies , " explains @entity22			2
in the @entity52 , larger companies often have to comply with automobile restrictions ( in @entity25 , cars ca n't load or unload in the city center between 10am and 4pm without incurring a fine ) and increased taxes for high - emission vehicles			1
delivery by bike avoids those pitfalls			2
research undertaken by @entity63 , an @entity52 - funded project dedicated to replacing motorized freight transport with bikes , found that bikes and cargo bikes could accommodate 51 % of all deliveries in @entity71 cities currently being moved by all types of motor vehicles and over 90 % of all supermarket shopping trips			1
according to @entity62 , that amounts to a saving of 37 million tons of @entity77 a year , or a full 1 % of @entity71 's current emissions			2
" @entity80 is n't even the main argument , " says dr. @entity79 , the project manager for @entity63			0
" there are an awful lot of more things that would benefit from moving shipping to bikes ; urban air pollution , noise pollution , traffic			1
those are big problems in @entity71			0
" of course , a surge in bike usage does raise the issue of bicycle casualties , though according to @entity95 , the policy officer for road safety and technical issues at @entity98 , reducing the number of delivery trucks could significantly reduce fatalities			1
" traditional lorries are really the most dangerous vehicle we come up against			0
they account for about 3 % of the total vehicle fleet in @entity71 , but 18 % of fatal road accidents			1
about 22 % of cyclists killed in the @entity52 are killed in collisions with good vehicles and public transport , " he notes			1
despite the many benefits to getting cargo bikes on the road , @entity79 finds that one of the biggest hurdles his mission faces is a misconception of what is transferable by bike			1
in point of fact , there are few limitations			0
@entity22 says some of the more unusual things they transport include medical samples and human tissue for local hospitals			0
" we 've taken heart valves , and eyes , and all sorts , " he notes			0
in @entity136 , a local sperm bank even developed a sperm - shaped bicycle that carries ( you guessed it ) sperm			2
to accomplish this , the belly of the bike has been outfitted with a nitrogen - cooled tank set to -320 degrees f to make carting samples around the city a possibility			0
" we have about 15 clinics around the city , and we used to find ourselves stuck in traffic a lot of the time			0
by bike , it 's an easy 20 minute ride between them , " explains dr. @entity152 , the ceo of the @entity153			0
while @entity157 notes he 's " taken it to the extreme , " he points out that in the cycle haven that is @entity136 , cargo bikes are becoming the norm over cars			1
" there are plumbers and carpenters and craftsmen that are starting to use bikes to carry a significant load			0
people here see the advantage of moving quickly through the city with more than you could carry on a regular bike .			0

research *suggests* that 90 % of grocery trips could be made by bicycle
cargo bikes could accommodate half of all deliveries made in urban centers
though delivery trucks account for 3 % @entity52 of traffic , they contribute to 18 % of fatal accidents
