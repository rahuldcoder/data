speaking exclusively to @entity2 from her home in @entity0 , @entity1 , the sister of dr. @entity14 said the jailed neuroscientist 's family wanted " no violence in @entity19 's name			1
" " i 'm @entity19 's sister			1
we 're @entity19 's family			2
and we speak on her behalf as well			2
we want no violence in @entity19 's name			2
our whole struggle has been one that is dignified that is peaceful that is legal , " @entity23 said			2

no one was wounded in the incident			2
she is serving her 86 - year sentence at a facility in @entity40			1
at the time of the 2008 shooting , @entity14 was in police custody after being arrested outside the @entity46 governor 's compound in @entity47			1
she was said to be acting suspiciously and found to be carrying " numerous documents describing the creation of explosives , chemical weapons , and other weapons involving biological material and radiological agents , " according to court documents			2
the papers included descriptions of various @entity35 landmarks and military assets , excerpts from the " @entity63 's @entity62 , " and a number of chemical substances in bottles and glass jars , the documents said			1
terror links ? @entity14 has never been charged with a terror - related offence , though @entity35 authorities made the link long before her capture			1
in 2004 , she was placed on an @entity74 alert list as a sought - after @entity76 member			1
her family has insisted she has no ties to terror			1
" there is no connection with @entity76 , the @entity82 or any terrorist organization			2
she was n't even charged with terrorism , " @entity23 said			2
however , @entity87 's name has recently appeared on documents purportedly from @entity7 militants in @entity90			1
a letter sent to the family of @entity35 journalist @entity93 , before video of his beheading surfaced this month , said the @entity35 government had been given " many chances " to negotiate for his release			1
it singled out @entity14 by name			0
" we have also offered prisoner exchanges to free the @entity105 currently in your detention like our sister dr @entity107 ( sic ) , however you proved very quickly to us that this is not what you are interested in , " the email said , which was published in full on the @entity112 website			1
' she is an icon ' @entity23 said her sister 's name had been appropriated by terrorists to suit their own agenda			1
" any kind of kidnappers , isis these days , the @entity121 brigade , or whoever wants to claim @entity19 , " she said			0
she said labels like " @entity124 " and the " @entity125 of @entity126 , " used by the media in reference to her sister made her cringe			2
" when i hear these things , like @entity124 -- i do n't even want to repeat that word -- and you know , it hurts			0
" @entity137 , the author of " @entity138 , " said @entity14 had become a cause de celebre for followers of jihad			0
" she is an icon , she is the poster girl for jihad , a rallying point ... she 's not just any woman , she is the premier symbol of the @entity105 woman in distress , " she said			0
conflicting accounts @entity23 , an accomplished clinical neurologist who trained at @entity149 , said her family had suffered tremendously since @entity19 vanished with her three young children in march 2003			0
she had just finished her thesis in cognitive neuroscience , and had left the family home to go to @entity155 , but never arrived			0
the youngest child was just six months old			0
" it 's as if she had fallen off the surface of the @entity159 ... i ca n't tell you how painful it was not knowing			0
you know if someone dies then you have a closure			0
here , there was no closure , " @entity23 said			0
five years of rumor and false leads ended in 2008 when news emerged that @entity19 was in @entity35 custody , accused of crimes for which she was later imprisoned			1
prosecutors said @entity14 shot at two @entity74 special agents , a @entity177 warrant officer , an @entity177 captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an @entity47 facility on july 18 , 2008			1
the warrant officer returned fire , shooting her in the torso , according to court documents			0
her family said the official version of events was wrong			0
" she was in custody			0
how could she in custody snatch a rifle , or even pick up a rifle from six armed @entity35 marshals , one woman ? " she asked			1
" i mean , these are @entity193 , @entity74 agents trained in weaponry , how could she ? it just does n't make sense			0
" calls for release @entity23 said her sister was the victim of the " war on terror , " that she said had created an atmosphere of fear and prejudice against @entity105			1
" it 's like they are labeled guilty and not even given a proper chance to prove their innocence , and a similar kind of thing happened with my sister , " she said			2
she said a lot of a misinformation had created a false impression of a woman who had wanted to use her degree to improve education in @entity1			0
the family claims @entity19 was never married to the nephew of 9/11 mastermind @entity222 , as had been widely reported			0
a online petition to the @entity224 seeking @entity19 's release has received more than 100,000 signatures over several weeks , and her family is currently seeking her release on appeal			0
" @entity19 should be released , but not for ransom , not in exchange , not for other people that are kidnapped by extremists , no. she should be released because that is the right thing to do , " @entity23 said .			0
