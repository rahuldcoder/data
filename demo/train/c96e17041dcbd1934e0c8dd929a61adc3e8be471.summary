-- @entity1 reported its first full - year net profit in five years on thursday and said it expected earnings to grow by a further 16 per cent this year , helped by restructuring efforts and a weaker yen			1
the @entity8 electronics and entertainment group said net profit for the year that ended in march totalled @entity10 ( $ 435m ) , a turnround from its massive @entity13 loss a year earlier			2
for the current year , it expects to earn a profit of @entity16			0
@entity1 was helped in the final quarter by a currency market that knocked almost 20 per cent off the yen 's value against the dollar and euro compared with the same period a year earlier , amplifying its overseas earnings			1
that added to the effect of a restructuring drive through which @entity1 has axed 10,000 jobs , or about 6 per cent of its workforce , shrunk its lossmaking television manufacturing business and sold its $ 1bn @entity30 headquarters			1
@entity1 booked a profit of @entity32 in the january - to - march quarter , compared with a @entity35 loss a year earlier			2
its once - dominant tv operation remained in the red , however			0
the company has struggled to compete against @entity40 and @entity41 producers in the era of digital flat - screens , and the operation has been losing money for nearly a decade			1
forty of @entity1 's top executives , including @entity47 , the chief executive since last year , are to give up bonuses worth 30 - 50 per cent of their pay after they failed to keep a promise to return the division to profit			1
@entity1 closed the gap considerably , however , and said it believed it would finally achieve its profitability goal this year			0
its consumer electronics loss in the year to march , of @entity57 , was 60 per cent smaller than it was a year earlier			0
the group 's overall earnings forecasts for the year to next march were more modest than those of industry experts			0
analysts surveyed by @entity63 before the earnings announcement were projecting a net profit of @entity66 on average			0
@entity1 said operating profit -- earnings before tax , depreciation and other adjustments -- would probably remain static this year at @entity73 , even as its sales increase by an expected 10 per cent thanks in part to more advantageous exchange rates			2
if the yen remains at its current level or weakens further , however , the company could do better than its guidance suggests			0
@entity1 based its forecasts on exchange rates of @entity84 to the dollar and @entity86 to the euro , levels about 8 per cent stronger than the yen 's current value			1
@entity1 has for some time relied on profits from the banking and insurance operations it owns in @entity8 to make up for weakness in other businesses			1
last year was no different : its financial arm earned a profit of @entity99 , three times more than the next most profitable division , its @entity103 - based film studio			0
