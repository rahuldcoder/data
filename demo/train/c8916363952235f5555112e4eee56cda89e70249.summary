@entity0 -- @entity2 wants you to know he 's talking about the issues that @entity5 is not			1
at the end of a winding answer to a question about how he differs from @entity5 , the @entity7 senator challenged the former secretary of state			1
" if we do not get our act together to come up with public policy which expands the middle class , if we do n't overturn @entity17 , if we do n't move to public funding of elections , we are going to live in an oligarchic form of society , " @entity2 said			2
" now is @entity5 going to say that ? " it was a candid moment and the closest the senator -- who is most known for being an independent who regularly targets @entity26 and money in politics -- came to a direct knock on @entity5 's possible run at the presidency during an interview with @entity1 before his upcoming trip to @entity34			1
his comment about @entity17 referred to a 2010 @entity7 @entity37 decision that opened the floodgates for outside money in politics and ballooned the amount spent on campaigns			0
it was also something that the @entity45 senator quickly realized did n't match his statement , " i am not here to attack @entity5			1
" " i know @entity5 , i respect @entity5 , " @entity2 said			1
" i knew her when she was first lady , i certainly knew her as a colleague in the @entity49			0
" i do n't know if @entity5 is running for president and i have no idea what she is going to be campaigning on			2
but i do know what i believe and what i will be speaking about			0
" @entity2 , who caucuses with @entity56 , is trying to thread a needle			2
he is little known outside liberal circles , yet the two - term senator is openly considering a run at the presidency in 2016			1
he is making the trip to @entity34 this weekend and will speak in @entity64 in a few weeks			2
he is floating the idea of a run with journalists and political operatives and saying things like , " if i choose to run			0
" yet @entity2 does n't want to openly talk about @entity5 and says he would rather focus on his views on the " political , " " economic " and " media " establishments			1
he is attacking @entity5 , something most democrats are n't doing , but trying to say he is n't			2
@entity5 to court @entity56 women in september @entity76 , a pro-clinton communications group , took issue with the idea that @entity5 did n't address the issues @entity2 had been addressing			1
" @entity2 has a good point -- the @entity7 people always want a campaign that includes a spirited dialogue about the issues , " said @entity80 , the group 's communications director			2
" but @entity5 has spent her entire life turning talk into action , putting policies in place to make lives better for all @entity7			0
" coincidentally , @entity2 ' trip to @entity34 this weekend comes at the same time @entity5 will be making her first trip to the critical presidential caucus state in six years			1
@entity5 to decide on 2016 run around end of year @entity5 , who is herself openly considering a run at the presidency , will be the headliner at the politically important @entity101			1
thousands of guests expect to listen to her speak , flip steaks and honor @entity104 , the liberal senator who is retiring after 2014			0
@entity2 , on the other hand , will not be at the steak fry			0
he will start the weekend with a speech at the @entity108 , an annual meeting of progressive speakers in @entity111 that honors @entity113 , a longtime liberal senator from the @entity111			0
following his speech , where aides expect him to articulate his liberal platform , @entity2 will travel to @entity34 for town hall - style events in @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , respectively			1
for @entity2 , who has done hundreds of town hall events in his home state , the @entity34 events comes with pros and cons. primarily , they allow the senator to get his name out there and gauge interest in him as a candidate			1
" i want to find out what kind of support there is for a progressive agenda which takes to the needs of a collapsing middle class and the growing wealth and income inequality @entity7 , " @entity2 said			0
" it is easy to give a good speech and get applause , it is not so easy to put together a grassroots movement of people who are prepared to fight for change			0
" but they will also offer a glimpse of his uphill climb			0
while @entity2 speaks to small town halls , @entity5 will likely be fawned over by thousands of supporters at the most political event of the year in @entity34			1
@entity2 was clear to point out that he does know @entity104 , the organizer of the steak fry , " very well " and was invited " a couple of years ago to be the guest			0
" but @entity2 sees a bigger positive for him in attending small events and offering a stark alternative to @entity5			1
" i do n't think anybody believes that anointment is a good idea , that anybody is quote unquote entitled to a nomination or any other position , " @entity2 said			0
" i think what people in @entity34 and through the country want to hear is a vigorous debate about the most important issues which impact their lives			2
it is not to say to somebody , ' oh , thank you , you are going to be anointed as our candidate			0

@entity2 challenges @entity5 to address issues he talks about in an interview with @entity1
" now is @entity5 going to say that ? " he asks after *outlining* part of his populist platform
senator realizes he knocked @entity5 and later states , " i am not here to attack @entity5 "
@entity2 is openly *toying* with a presidential run and will be in @entity34 this week
