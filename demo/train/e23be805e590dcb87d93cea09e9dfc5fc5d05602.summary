@entity0 -- " those who win become emperors , those who lose become bandits			0
" this old @entity7 adage may be an apt subtitle to the political drama that has been playing in @entity7 in recent months			1
it climaxed this week when @entity11 , a popular and polarizing politician , was dismissed as @entity13 chief of @entity14 , the biggest metropolis in @entity7			1
@entity11 's dismissal is the most sensational political scandal to hit the @entity13 in recent years			1
@entity7 axes @entity11 from @entity14 after scandal as a son of a revolutionary veteran and an official with a solid , albeit controversial record , @entity11 was considered a strong contender for promotion into the @entity25 of the party 's @entity26 , whose nine members decide how to run @entity7			1
in autumn this year , the @entity29 will convene in @entity0 to confirm sweeping changes in this 1.37 billion - strong nation			0
held every five years , it will set national priorities and choose a new set of leaders			0
the stage is set for the race to the top			0
that race is opaque , mostly decided inside the leadership compound in @entity40 by various factions and vested interests -- conservatives , reformers , party apparatchiks , technocrats , regional leaders , army officers and princelings -- or taizi , referring to the children of veteran officials			0
why @entity7 succession matters for years , @entity11 seemed destined to succeed in a career that befitted his pedigree as a princeling			1
i knew @entity11 when we both studied at @entity59 's history department in the late 1970s			1
i majored in @entity7 history , he in world history			2
we sometimes ate lunch together , standing while eating around a table with other classmates in the university cafeteria ( there were not enough stools for every diner			0
) we typically talked about current events and debated history and politics			0
@entity11 was particularly keen to practice speaking @entity73 with foreign students like me			1
" his top ambition then was to be a @entity7 journalist posted overseas , " recalls a classmate and close friend of @entity11			1
two years later , after getting his @entity59 degree , @entity11 got into the master 's degree program in journalism , the first ever , at the @entity84			1
after graduation , however , @entity11 did not pursue his ambition to become a foreign correspondent			2
instead , he worked his way up as a local party and government official			0
he spent 17 years in @entity91 , a charming but gritty coastal city in northeastern @entity7			1
he became @entity91 mayor in 1993 and transformed it into a popular investment and tourism destination			0
as early as 1999 , @entity11 was expected to move to @entity0 for a ministerial post but his promotion was aborted when he failed to get elected into the @entity98 , the @entity13 's ruling elite			1
meantime , @entity11 served as the governor and later party chief of @entity101 , a rust - belt region in northeast @entity7 which then boasted of large but mostly money - losing state - owned enterprises			1
in @entity101 , @entity11 dealt with high unemployment and endemic corruption			2
in 2004 , when @entity11 finally got elected into the elite @entity98 , he moved to @entity0 as minister of trade and commerce			2
" he was a tough and effective negotiator in terms of defending @entity7 's global trade policies and interests , " said @entity107 , a professor at the @entity108 and @entity11 's former classmate at @entity59			1
for decades , @entity107 recalls , @entity11 stood out as one of @entity7 's most dynamic and maverick politicians			1
i too have seen @entity11 impress foreign business and political leaders with his charisma and political savvy			2
instead of reading prepared speeches or reciting memorized lines , for example , he often spoke extemporaneously			0
" @entity11 is a populist leader , " says @entity124 , a political science professor at the @entity125 , who also remembers @entity11 as a fellow student at @entity59 in the late 1970s			1
" his populist and sometimes emotional appeal sets him apart from the rest of the technocratic leaders who can certainly win the contest for the most boring politicians , " @entity124 opines			0
" he would have had a chance to become @entity7 's top leader , if @entity7 had direct elections			2
but he shows too much personality and charisma in the @entity138 political culture that emphasizes collective leadership			0
" @entity11 gained national prominence -- and a host of enemies -- when he moved in to @entity14 in 2007			1
there , he made his name by " striking black " and " singing red			0
" striking black ( dahei in @entity7 ) refers to a ruthless , relentless crackdown on corruption and gangster activities			2
singing red ( changhong ) refers to mass - singing of militant @entity150 ( 1966 - 76 ) songs that harked back to @entity153			0
@entity11 's " strike black " campaign implicated millionaires , local officials , police officers and gangsters involved in bribery , prostitution , gambling , drugs and guns			1
during the crackdown , @entity11 relied mainly on @entity165 , a tough and decorated policeman who served as @entity14 's police chief from 2009 to 2011			1
the campaign led to thousands of arrests and several executions			0
@entity165 was promoted to vice mayor as a reward			0
ironically , it was also @entity165 who torpedoed @entity11 's career			1
on february 8 , @entity165 was unexpectedly reported to be " on leave " for health reasons			0
days later , @entity165 mysteriously fled into the @entity177 consulate in @entity178 , six hours ' drive away from @entity14			2
the next day , @entity165 left the consulate " of his own volition , " @entity177 officials said , and was taken into custody by security officials			0
asylum rumors sparked by @entity7 crime buster 's ' medical leave ' it remains unclear why @entity165 attempted to seek refuge in the @entity177 consulate and what repercussions his action may have			2
the " @entity194 , " as the @entity7 media calls it , has been under investigation			0
@entity7 premier @entity196 this week said the results of the investigation will be made public and " should be able to stand the test of law and history			0
" meantime , the scandal has led to @entity11 's humiliating downfall			1
@entity0 is abuzz with rumors that worse punishment may await @entity11			0
on @entity7 's treacherous road to the pinnacle of power , it takes only a few wrong turns for a maverick politician to end up like a " bandit			2

@entity11 's sacking is the biggest political scandal to hit @entity7 for years
the @entity14 chief was dismissed amid a scandal involving a key deputy
@entity221 met @entity11 when both were students at @entity59
@entity224 and popular , @entity11 was once seen as rising star in @entity7 politics
