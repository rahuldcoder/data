options for meat substitutes have come a long way since @entity4 's first few thanksgivings as vegetarian in the 1970s			1
vegetable side dishes and salads were nice but they did n't seem as festive as a turkey , the traditional @entity10 centerpiece			1
the @entity12 man tried all kinds of experiments , from a stuffed pumpkin to a gluten roast that took all day to make but was " unsliceable and indigestible			2
" after becoming a professional " soycrafter " in 1980 , @entity4 noticed that sales seemed to slow around @entity10 and @entity19 " as people lost their vegetarian ways and guiltily ate traditional fare like turkey , " he said			1
aside from tofu , which was primarily only sold in @entity26 markets , the only commercially available meat alternatives were made by @entity29 companies , and many of these products were canned			2
" i subsisted on a diet of homemade items like pressure - cooked soybeans and tortillas , soy grit burgers , bread and granola , " he told @entity32			0
over the years , fake meat -- or what some call plant - based meat -- grew to include burgers , hot dogs and ground beef			1
but poultry was still a relatively untapped niche , especially when it came to holiday centerpieces			0
with the help of @entity53 sandwich maker @entity51 , @entity4 came up with the first @entity54 in 1995 and sold them in the @entity56			0
since then , @entity57 has become a punchline on shows like @entity60 and " the x-files			1
" in homes across the country , families have begrudgingly ceded space on the table to vegetarian relatives			0
@entity69 's mayor pardoned a @entity70 named @entity71 this year to kick off a food drive			2
@entity4 is laughing all the way to the bank as his fake turkey product enters its 20th season this @entity10			1
the company says that more than 3.4 million tofurky roasts have been sold since 1995 , and several competitors have emerged , creating more tasty bird - free roast options than ever for the holidays			1
do n't fear the vegan at your @entity10 table with its torpedo shape and spongy , loaf - like consistency , the @entity57 and its competitors are a far gobble from a real bird			1
but add some stuffing and gravy and many agree you have an equally worthy @entity10 centerpiece			2
" it 's that traditional centerpiece , that protein source , that acts as the main dish , " said @entity97 , food blogger at @entity98 and author of " @entity100 : @entity105 in the @entity106			0
" " a roast brings that taste and texture of turkey that we associate with @entity10			1
" flavor without the ' questions ' to eat meat substitutions or not is a perennial topic of debate among vegetarians and vegans , especially as mainstream demand for meatless options grows			1
some meat substitutes contain processed ingredients , additives and preservatives , adding up to a fake hot dog that 's not much healthier than a real hot dog			2
then there 's the question of whether they defeat the point of avoiding meat			0
does it send mixed messages about what vegetarians and vegans want ? are n't there enough delicious whole vegetarian foods without having to resort to meat substitutions ? on some level , plant - based meat defends the point of a meatless lifestyle , says vegan blogger and cookbook author @entity142			1
thanks to culinary progress , some meatless options are much more than soy protein , water and flavoring			0
@entity150 , another popular maker of meat alternatives , uses wheat and pea proteins as well as ancient grains that include quinoa and kamut , @entity142 said in a 2010 blog post			0
and , while some plant - based meats resemble and taste like the products they impersonate , they do it without the saturated fat , hormones , preservatives , antibiotics or the cruelty , she said			0
" i did n't stop eating meat because of the taste			2
i stopped because of the questions			0
" fake meat can be especially helpful for people in the early stages of transitioning away from meat -- especially during the holidays			1
seeking the ' taste and texture of turkey ' @entity181 also stopped eating meat because of ethical questions			1
she went vegetarian the day after @entity10 in 1994 , and then ten years later , in 2004 , she went vegan , the day after @entity10			1
coming from the @entity106 , it was not easy , she said			0
" i loved the taste and texture of meat , but as soon as i understood where meat came from , i could no longer stomach it			1
yet i still longed for the taste and texture			2
and i found the answer in plant meats , " she said			0
" thankfully , they 've improved a great deal since i first switched to plant meats 20 years ago			1
so many vegan companies now make plant meats with very high - quality ingredients , resulting in a minimally processed product that 's actually nutritious			0
" she points to ingredients in the @entity150 turkey substitute she 's eating this season : " water , soy protein isolate , vital wheat gluten , expeller pressed canola oil , organic ancient grain flour ( kamut , amaranth , millet , quinoa ) , natural flavors ( from plant sources ) , modified vegetable gum , yeast extract , potato starch , sea salt , organic cane sugar , onion powder , garlic powder , pea protein , carrot fiber , beetroot fiber , extractives of paprika and turmeric			0
" she knows plenty of vegans who 'd prefer a stuffed butternut squash centerpiece			0
to her , it sounds like a delicious side dish			0
it may not be as healthy as a whole foods - based centerpiece , but come on -- it 's @entity10 ! " we 're supposed to gorge and let go of any food rules , " she said			2
" it 's a holiday , and we 're celebrating ! "			0
