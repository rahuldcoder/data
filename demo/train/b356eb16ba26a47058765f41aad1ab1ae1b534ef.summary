the @entity1 's intelligence arm has assessed with " moderate confidence " that @entity3 has the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile , though the reliability is believed to be " low			1
" disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing on thursday and then confirmed to @entity12 by the @entity1 , the assessment by the @entity9 is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the @entity14 about potential advances in @entity3 's nuclear program			1
the surprise development comes amid heightened tensions on the @entity19			0
@entity3 has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the @entity14 and @entity22 in recent weeks , including that of a possible nuclear strike			1
the @entity26 administration calculates a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time			1
but a senior administration official said there is no indication that missiles believed being readied for tests have been armed with any nuclear material			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity35 said later thursday , " it would be inaccurate to suggest that the @entity3 regime has fully tested , developed , or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage " of the @entity9 study			1
that stance was echoed by @entity43 , director of @entity14 national intelligence , who said the statement read by rep. @entity47 " is not an intelligence community assessment			1
moreover , @entity3 has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile			1
" @entity47 , @entity51 , read from a declassified version of the @entity9 assessment at a @entity55 hearing			1
" @entity9 assess with moderate confidence the @entity3 currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles , however , the reliability will be low			1
" reliability is apparently a reference to the accuracy of the missiles			2
@entity66 chairman gen. @entity65 , who was testifying before the @entity67 , appeared to be caught off guard when asked by @entity47 whether he agreed with the @entity9 assessment			2
" well , i have n't seen it , " @entity65 replied			0
" and you said it 's not publicly released , so i -- i choose not to comment on it			0
" it is was not clear whether other @entity14 intelligence agencies , such as the @entity75 , agree with the defense analysis			1
the @entity14 intelligence about @entity3 revealed thursday was " mistakenly " marked as declassified , according to an administration and a defense source			1
but @entity47 told @entity12 's " @entity81 " he acted properly , reciting declassified information			1
" whether it was a mistake or not , i ca n't answer that , " @entity47 said of the information release			0
" given the seriousness of the threat , this is something that i think people do need to know about			0
" a @entity55 aide said staffers checked with the @entity9 to confirm the passage was not classified before @entity47 read it			0
@entity3 's missile capabilities @entity95 @entity94 ban ki - moon told @entity12 's @entity96 , " we do not have any independent information to verify " the @entity9 study 's assessment			1
tough talk , raising a missile is @entity3 serious about military action or is it just testing the world ? a missile had been briefly raised to an upright firing position , stoking concerns that a launch was imminent , a @entity14 official told @entity12 on thursday			1
later , another @entity14 official said it had been tucked back into its launcher			0
in more tough talk from @entity115 , a government agency was quoted by the state - run media as saying that " war can break out any moment			0
" after meeting privately with @entity119 in the @entity120 , president @entity26 called on @entity3 to tone down the rhetoric			1
" we agree now is the time for @entity3 to end the kind of belligerent approach they have been taking and try to lower temperatures , " @entity26 said during a photo opportunity			1
" no one wants to see a conflict on the @entity19			0
" war of words escalates : timeline of a crisis @entity119 called on @entity136 diplomats to " exercise their leadership and influence " with @entity3 to reduce tensions			1
@entity14 secretary of state @entity142 , during an upcoming visit , will tell @entity136 leaders that @entity115 is , as one senior administration official said , " putting @entity136 's own interests at risk			0
" the @entity14 wants @entity148 to " stop the money trail into @entity3 " and to carry a strong message to the @entity3 that denuclearization of the @entity19 is @entity136 's goal , said the official and a senior @entity154 official			1
the latest move by the @entity156 could signify that a much - feared launch is less imminent			0
it could also mean the government was testing the equipment			0
the first @entity14 official cautioned that the raising of the missile could have been just a trial run to ensure the equipment works or an effort to " mess " with the @entity14 and the allies that are watching for a launch at any time			0
so far , @entity22 -- who 've heard the cross-border bombast before -- are taking the swagger in stride			0
@entity175 regards much of the @entity3 's saber rattling as bluster			1
but no one is taking any chances as the daily clamor of threats from @entity3 leader @entity182 's government shows no sign of letting up			2
the official declined to specify what type of intelligence led the @entity14 to conclude the medium - range missile -- a @entity189 -- was in a firing position			1
should i stay or should i go ? expats mull future there the @entity189 is an untested weapon that @entity22 says has a range as far as 2,175 miles ( 3,500 kilometers )			0
it could reach as far as @entity198 , a @entity199 territory that is home to @entity14 naval and air bases , and where the @entity14 recently said it was placing missile defense systems			2
the @entity14 and @entity22 militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of @entity3			1
@entity207 has deployed defense systems			0
@entity209 , chairman of the @entity210 , told @entity12 on thursday that @entity182 is using rhetoric to solidify his base within his country and its military			0
" @entity3 is one of those countries that 's an army with a country , not a country with an army , " said @entity209			2
opinion : why @entity3 worries @entity222 the mood in @entity22 ? ' very ordinary ' life is generally continuing as normal in the region , however , despite the @entity3 's barrage of recent threats , which have included warnings to foreigners on the peninsula about their safety in the event of conflict			2
@entity22 , who have experienced decades of @entity3 rage and posturing -- and occasional localized attacks -- have gone about their daily business without alarm			2
" @entity22 has been living under such threats from the past , and we are always prepared for it , " @entity22 unification minister @entity240 told @entity12 wednesday			0
he called the current climate " a very ordinary situation			0
" @entity136 tourism : the good , the bad and the backlash @entity22 urges dialogue over industrial zone the difficulties at the @entity252 industrial zone , a key symbol of @entity255 cooperation , are among the few tangible signs of the tensions			0
@entity115 repeated a threat to permanently close the industrial zone , which it jointly operates with the @entity22 , accusing @entity22 president @entity260 of putting the manufacturing complex at risk			0
the @entity22 government , meanwhile , urged @entity115 to work to resolve the situation through dialogue			0
" @entity115 should come to the bargaining table immediately , " @entity240 said			0
@entity3 has pulled its more than 50,000 workers out of the complex , which is on the northern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the two @entity271 , and blocked personnel and supply trucks from entering it from @entity22			2
in a statement reported thursday by state - run media , the @entity3 government said that what happens at the complex in the coming days " entirely depends on the attitude of the @entity22 authorities			2
" @entity281 : tensions high at knife - edge of korean conflict @entity14 intelligence cites direct threats the dangers posed by @entity3 came up thursday at a separate @entity210 hearing about worldwide threats			1
@entity43 said the @entity14 believes the primary objective of @entity182 's bellicose rhetoric is to " consolidate and affirm his power " and to show he is " in control of @entity3			2
" @entity43 said he does n't think @entity182 " has much of an endgame " other than to get recognition from the world as a nuclear power which " entitles him to negotiation , accommodation and , presumably , aid			0
" but in a statement for the record before the committee , @entity43 reiterated that the nation 's " nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the @entity14 and to the security environment in @entity311			2
" since december , @entity3 has put a satellite in orbit atop a long - range rocket ; conducted a nuclear bomb test , its third since 2006 ; and claimed to be prepared for pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the @entity14 , though most analysts believe it does not yet have that capability			1
its most recent nuclear test , in february , resulted in tougher @entity95 sanctions , which infuriated @entity115 , prompting it to sharpen its threats			0
annual military exercises in @entity22 by @entity14 and @entity22 troops , which often upset the @entity3 , have added to the tensions , especially when the @entity14 drew attention to shows of strength such as a practice mission by @entity330 stealth bombers .			2
