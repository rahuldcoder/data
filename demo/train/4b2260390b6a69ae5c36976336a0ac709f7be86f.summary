@entity2 likely flew into the southern @entity3 on autopilot with an unresponsive crew , @entity1 authorities said thursday , divulging new details about what they believe happened during the missing plane 's final hours			1
the information emerged as officials announced a southward shift , as expected , in the underwater search for the @entity13 , which disappeared march 8 with 239 people on board			1
searchers have found no trace of the jetliner or its passengers , making the case probably the biggest mystery in aviation history and leaving the families of those on board bereft of answers			0
the @entity1 officials said they believe the plane was on autopilot throughout its journey over the @entity3 until it ran out of fuel			1
they cited the straight track on which the aircraft flew , according to electronic " handshakes " it periodically exchanged with satellites			1
" it is highly , highly likely that the aircraft was on autopilot , otherwise it could not have followed the orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings , " @entity1 deputy prime minister @entity36 told reporters in @entity38			1
unresponsive crew ? in a report explaining the change in search area , @entity1 authorities suggested that flight 370 's crew may have been in an " unresponsive " state , possibly caused by a lack of oxygen			1
that scenario " appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of @entity2 's flight , " the report said , citing previous air accidents in which crews had been rendered unresponsive by a lack of oxygen , also known as hypoxia			2
but it cautioned that the assumption was " made for the purposes of defining a search area and there is no suggestion that the investigation authority will make similar assumptions			1
" the @entity1 officials declined to talk about the causes behind flight 370 's errant flight path , saying those are questions for the @entity75 authorities in charge of the overall investigation			1
and they said they were n't sure exactly when the autopilot had been turned on			0
' most likely place ' their disclosure that a computer rather than a human was most likely steering the plane during its final hours adds a little more detail to the largely obscured picture of what took place that march night			1
but the key questions of why the passenger jet flew dramatically off its intended route -- from @entity91 , @entity75 , to @entity92 -- and where exactly it ended up remain unanswered			0
the next phase of the underwater search aims to resolve at least one of those issues			2
@entity36 said an international team of experts had chosen the 60,000 - square - kilometer zone , an area roughly the size of @entity103 , after going over all the available data			0
" this site is the best available and most likely place where the aircraft is resting , " he said			1
he warned , though , that the operation to comb the sea floor in the area , which has never been fully mapped , would be " very challenging and complex			0
" " we could be fortunate and find it in the first hour , or the first day , " he said			0
" but it could take another twelve months			0
" biggest search in history the hunt for the plane has already become " biggest search operation in history , covering 4.5 million square kilometers of ocean surface , " @entity36 said			2
during the early phase of the search , aircraft and ships scoured vast stretches of the surface of the southern @entity3 but found no debris from flight 370			1
@entity127 initially thought to be from the missing plane 's flight recorders led to a concentrated underwater search that turned up nothing			2
last week , a group of independent experts -- using satellite data publicly released in may -- said it thought the missing aircraft was hundreds of miles southwest of the previous underwater search site			2
doubts among families " it is encouraging that the @entity1 leadership has taken a very methodical and rigorous approach to redefining the search area , but is it still different than some of the other outside experts had defined , " said @entity140 , whose partner , @entity141 , was on board the missing plane			1
she said she could n't reconcile the differences between the analyses			0
" we do n't trust that the officials are being forthright with the information , " she said			0
the next underwater search will be broadly in an area where planes and vessels had already looked for debris on the surface of the water , @entity36 said			2
it 's roughly 1,800 kilometers off the coast of @entity164			0
two ships have already started mapping the ocean floor of the area , a process that will take about three months			0
the underwater search , which will rely on the ships ' maps , is expected to begin in august			0
it will be led by a private contractor that @entity1 authorities will appoint			1
@entity75 will contribute equipment to the search effort , including vessels and towed sonar systems , @entity36 said			0
for families of the missing , a hole in the clouds , an empty space on earth			0

crew may have been in an " unresponsive " state , @entity1 authorities say
plane was likely on autopilot when it flew into the @entity3 , officials say
the next phase of the search will move to an area *farther* south in the @entity3
the area is the " most likely place where the aircraft is resting , " an @entity1 official says
