-- as someone who studies the morality of babies , i am sometimes asked " are we naturally good or naturally evil ? " my answer is yes			1
most adults have a sense of right and wrong			1
with the intriguing exception of some psychopaths , people are appalled by acts of cruelty , such as the rape of a child , and uplifted by acts of kindness , such as those heroes who jump onto subways tracks to rescue fallen strangers from oncoming trains			2
there is a universal urge to help those in need and to punish wrongdoers and there are universal emotional responses that revolve around morality — anger when we are wronged , pride when we do the right thing and guilt when we transgress			0
in " @entity35 , " i argue that much of this is the product of biological evolution			0
humans are born with a hard - wired morality , a sense of good and evil is bred in the bone			1
i know this claim might sound outlandish , but it 's supported now by research in several laboratories			0
babies and toddlers can judge the goodness and badness of others ' actions ; they want to reward the good and punish the bad ; they act to help those in distress ; they feel compassion , guilt and righteous anger			1
in my own research at @entity61 , done in collaboration with my colleague ( and wife ) , @entity65 , we show babies one - act plays — puppets shows in which one puppet acts kindly toward a character ( helping it up a hill , or opening a box for it , or passing it a ball ) and the other puppet acts in a cruel way ( pushing it down a hill , or slamming the box shut , or stealing the ball )			2
babies ca n't speak , but we can learn about their judgments and preferences from their behavior — where they look , what they reach for , and , for older babies , who they will give a treat to and who they will take a treat from			2
we find that even 3 - month - olds prefer the good guy to the bad guy , and that older babies and toddlers will reward the good guy and punish the bad guy			1
babies also prefer other characters that do the same ; they prefer a just puppet who rewards the good and punishes the bad over an unjust puppet who does the opposite			1
the existence of a universal moral sense is the good news			1
but we are , as the anthropologist @entity113 put it , risen apes , not fallen angels			0
our brains are the products of natural selection and so one would expect our innate morality to have certain limits			0
indeed , studies find that babies start off as little bigots , eagerly dividing the world into us versus them and strongly favoring their own group over everyone else			1
although the baby 's capacity for moral judgment applies broadly , when it comes to kindness and compassion , we start off indifferent — or worse — toward strangers			2
the biologist @entity142 was right , then , when he said at the start of " @entity144 , " " be warned that if you wish , as i do , to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly toward a common good , you can expect little help from biological nature			0
" or , as a character in a @entity147 novel put it : " it was no wonder that people were so horrible when they started life as children			0
" fortunately , we can transcend our limited biological natures			0
modern humans possess abstract moral notions of equality and freedom for all ; we see racism and sexism as evil ; we reject slavery and genocide ; we try to love our enemies			1
of course , our actions typically fall short , often way short , of our moral principles , but these principles do shape , in a substantial way , the world that we live in			1
and being exposed as a child to these moral ideals — and interacting with people who exemplify these ideals — is an essential part of growing up to be a good person			1
why does this research matter ? for one thing , these findings can change the way parents think of their own babies and children			0
many people believe we are born selfish and amoral — that we start off as pint - sized psychopaths			0
others think that genes are destiny , and that some babies are bad seeds , unredeemable souls from the very start			0
both these cynical views are mistaken			0
we are naturally moral beings , but our environments can enhance — or , sadly , degrade — this innate moral sense			1
finally , an understanding of moral psychology can help us make the world a better place			1
if you 're interested in reducing racism and bigotry , for instance , it is critical to understand the inborn proclivity to favor one 's own group over others ; if you want to create a just society , you 'll want to learn about how we naturally think about fairness and equity			2
good social policy is informed by an understanding of human nature at its best and its worst , and this is what the science of baby morality is all about			0

@entity219 : are people naturally good or evil ? studies with babies yield clues
he says babies as young as 3 months exhibit a sense of right and wrong
but babies also divide world into us and them , showing strong preference for their own group
@entity219 : humans are naturally moral beings but environment can influence how we develop
