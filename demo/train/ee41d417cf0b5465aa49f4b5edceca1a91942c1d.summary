@entity0 -- while it 's not a stretch to imagine the @entity7 saga would spawn books and movies , a group of amateur filmmakers in @entity0 have already beaten @entity10 to the punch with a short thriller dramatizing the events that unfolded in the city last month			1
on june 9 , @entity7 identified himself as the source of leaked classified documents exposing mass surveillance programs purportedly operated by the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			0
the @entity20 computer technician also revealed he had been hiding out in @entity0 for three weeks , sparking widespread speculation about his exact whereabouts and whether he would find safe refuge in the territory -- a special administrative region of the @entity26			0
two days later , freelance videographer @entity27 contacted a few friends about shooting a short film about the maelstrom swirling around @entity7 in the city			2
" we were so intrigued as to why @entity7 came to @entity0 , " @entity27 said , an @entity33 expatriate			2
" all of us love @entity0 to death ; we all call @entity0 home			0
" the five - minute film was shot over four days , @entity27 said , describing it as a " foot - on - the - gas " guerrilla operation			1
the script was mostly written the day before shooting and actors had no rehearsal time , he added			0
yet the final product is surprisingly suspenseful and sophisticated , with gorgeous time - lapse panoramas of the city and " shaky cam " shots reminiscent of @entity10			2
( @entity27 , who was largely in charge of cinematography and editing , named the @entity53 film series and director @entity54 as inspirations			0
) in its first week , the film has garnered over 43,000 views on @entity58			1
while @entity27 and his three co-directors / producers took creative license with plot details , such as an imagined briefing between a mainland @entity68 attaché and @entity0 police , they also filmed scenes inside the same hotel where @entity7 had stayed and shot a video interview with @entity72			1
renting the hotel room cost half of their estimated hk $ 4,200 budget ( us $ 540 ) , @entity27 said			0
the actor who played @entity7 in the film also bears a remarkable similarity to the man himself , to the extent that the hairdresser who cut off the actor 's " long shaggy hair " to mirror @entity7 's photo warned him afterward not to be mistaken for the fugitive , said co-producer @entity86 , who orchestrated his makeover			1
curiously @entity7 has no dialogue in the film			0
" yes the film was about @entity7 , but he was n't featured the most prominently , " @entity27 said , adding that the team was careful not to impose judgments upon a man who largely remains a mystery to them			0
" he 's mostly the catalyst [ of events ] affecting all these different people around him ; it 's more about the vignettes , " @entity27 said , describing the film 's focus as split " 50 - 50 " between @entity7 and the city of @entity0			1
rather , the film is intended more as a homage to @entity0 by a group of expatriates who love the city			1
" we tried to give @entity0 the limelight we think it deserves , " @entity86 said			0
describing a " very muted response to the @entity7 affair " from @entity0 and the @entity26 central government , @entity27 also acknowledged an underlying political critique in invoking the @entity68 attaché			2
the scene was intended as a " vehicle to represent ( @entity0 's ) relationship with @entity26 " and the murkiness of @entity122 's role in the @entity7 affair			1
" to say @entity26 was n't pulling any strings at all would be naïve ... even though it gives us autonomy , it 's always @entity122 that calls the shots , " @entity27 said			0
in a keen cultural detail , the attaché speaks in @entity132 , while the officers respond in @entity134			0
@entity0 authorities have denied that @entity26 influenced @entity7 's decision to leave the city			1
while @entity27 said @entity7 's sudden departure did n't cut their project short , he said it hastened the editing process to get the film out			1
he said there are no plans to extend the film or shoot a sequel , now that @entity7 has left the city .			2

group of amateur filmmakers in @entity0 made thriller about @entity7 's time in the city
despite limited budget and time , five - minute film attracted over 43,000 @entity58 views in first week
crew found @entity7 *lookalike* and rented room in same hotel that @entity7 stayed in
@entity165 was intended as homage to city of @entity0 , rather than only @entity7 's story
