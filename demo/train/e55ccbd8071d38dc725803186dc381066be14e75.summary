-- just days after " @entity3 " director @entity2 traveled to the bottom of the sea , another wealthy adventurer has announced a spectacular deep ocean discovery			2
@entity8 founder and ceo @entity7 has unveiled plans to recover the @entity12 engines that powered the @entity14 rocket carrying @entity15 and the @entity17 mission to the moon			1
" i 'm excited to report that , using state - of - the - art deep sea sonar , the team has found the @entity17 engines lying 14,000 feet below the surface , and we 're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor , " the billionaire investor and entrepreneur wrote			1
" we do n't know yet what condition these engines might be in ; they hit the ocean at high velocity and have been in saltwater for more than 40 years , " said @entity7			1
" on the other hand , they 're made of tough stuff , so we 'll see			2
" @entity7 said that watching that original mission as a 5 - year - old in 1969 inspired him to dream big , and now he wants to undertake the huge challenge of pulling the engines up			1
each of the engines weighs nearly 9 tons , and they came in a cluster of five			1
they provided 32 million horsepower by burning 6,000 pounds of fuel every second , and the five together put the largest rocket in history 38 miles up in under three minutes			2
after doing their work , the rockets plummeted into the ocean , where they have been undiscovered for four decades			0
@entity52 had some clues as to where they landed , and a piece of the debris landed on a @entity59 merchant ship , providing more clues			0
@entity61 , a space memorabilia expert who runs @entity64 , said there were a total of 65 of these engines launched			2
he said if the engines are able to be brought to the surface and a serial number can be found , it would be easy to authenticate the find			2
but bringing them up will be a challenge			0
" if all five are still clumped together , it will be like trying to bring up the big part of the @entity3 , " @entity61 said			0
still , it 's not the first time a lost piece of the space race era has been found			0
@entity52 's @entity83 space capsule piloted by @entity84 was found and recovered in 1999			0
it 's just the latest instance of a well - financed businessman making a big splash discovery or extreme feat. just this week @entity2 took a solo dive to the deepest part of the ocean , while sir @entity92 used millions to fund his attempts to travel around the globe in a balloon			0
@entity61 said @entity7 ' announcement came as a complete surprise to the space memorabilia world			1
" but that fits into the way he does business , " @entity61 said , noting @entity7 ' other venture into space flight , @entity101 , which aims to make human space flight cheaper and easier			1
" @entity7 and that @entity101 have always played their cards very close to their chest and often do n't share their milestones until after they have succeeded			2
" but profits do n't seem to be behind @entity7 ' quest to find the @entity12 engines			1
the rocket engines remain property of @entity52 and the @entity117 government , and @entity7 wrote that he would like to pull the engines to the surface and then have @entity52 put them on display at a museum in @entity123			1
the @entity14 engines could be priceless historically , but hard to put a cash value on			1
@entity61 noted that the highest price paid for a piece of space memorabilia was $ 2 million , paid by a @entity130 investor for a @entity132 - era vostok rocket			0
" it 's hard to imagine getting two investors to get in a bidding war at auction over them , " said @entity61			0
" components have sold for thousands of dollars , but they were all spare parts			0
but you have to have pretty deep pockets and a very big space to put something like this on display and maintain it			0
