-- it seemed like a harmless comment , or so @entity3 thought at the time			2
the year was 1992 , and @entity4 had just appeared on " the @entity5 " to play a rendition of " @entity7 " on his saxophone			2
@entity3 thought it was entertaining ; his supervisor , on the other hand , thought the stunt " demeaned the office of @entity13 , " @entity3 recalls			2
@entity3 offered his opinion to his supervisor and that he " relax			0
" it turned out to be the wrong choice of words , he said			0
" he immediately got upset and started arguing with me , and for nearly half an hour , we kept arguing about the issue until we finally both walked away in disgust , " said @entity3 , a public relations specialist in @entity20 who was not associated with the show or @entity4 's campaign			1
" for the next several weeks , every time he talked to me , he would throw in a jab at my opinion , and it would take all my willpower to keep myself from taking the bait			0
" the jabs eventually died down , but the damage was done , @entity3 said			0
with that , he learned a lesson : never talk politics in the workplace			1
" most people are so passionately committed to their viewpoints that no discussion ever ends civilly , nobody wins , and nothing comes of it but a shouting match , " he said			1
it may seem like common sense , but with the @entity52 primary season entering full swing , political discourse tends to spill over into the workplace			1
among the rank and file , there 's a chance that political discourse can work around the water cooler if you know your audience , human resource and etiquette experts say			1
" do n't assume other people believe what you believe , " said etiquette expert @entity66 with the @entity67			1
" you do n't choose who you work with , so it 's really important that that relationship is a good one			1
" in other words , it 's a risky gamble			0
if you ca n't keep it civil , or you 're not sure the other person can , keep it to yourself , the experts agree			0
" as we get closer to the election and the rhetoric gets even more heated , it 's even more advisable to leave your politics at home , " said @entity80 , ceo of @entity82 , a workplace training benefits firm			1
" you need to create an environment that feels comfortable and productive in every way to employees if you want to get the best out of them			0
" most companies are n't likely to have a formal policy on the discussion of politics			1
but there are policies regulating against a hostile work environment , said @entity101 , a @entity103 @entity102 who also runs a polling organization			1
" from the management point of view , there 's a need to be mindful of not creating a hostile environment , and that includes being intolerant of direct reports ' beliefs on politics or otherwise			1
" some companies attract employees of a certain political persuasion , but that 's usually clear coming in the door , he said			2
" if you 're going to take a job with the @entity122 , you know what they 're about , " he said			0
" but to come into something that 's supposed to be neutral and then feel pressure to take a certain position that you do n't want to , that 's not ok			0
" if you 're dying to discuss last night 's debate , avoid judgmental language and focus on facts over feelings , @entity130 said			2
" you want to keep this as undebatable as possible , " @entity66 said			0
" you also need to be wiling to swallow the last word , be able to agree to disagree and be willing to bow out before it escalates			0
" now a manager at another company , @entity139 , the @entity20 - based public relations specialist , prefers to avoid the topic of politics altogether			1
" i do n't get involved , and i do discourage it , " he said			0
" with politics and sports , it seems like there 's rarely a middle ground to be reached			2
and that 's not good for business			0

with @entity52 primaries under way , politics becomes water cooler talk
those who *'ve* been there prefer to keep political discourse of out the workplace
" no discussion ever ends civilly , nobody wins , " public relations specialist says
expert : talking politics can work if you know your audience and focus on fact , etiquette
