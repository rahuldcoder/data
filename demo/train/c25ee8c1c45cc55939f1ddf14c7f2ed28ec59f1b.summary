@entity0 -- when a scuffle broke out at a candidate forum in @entity5 last week between supporters of senate majority leader @entity7 and @entity9 rival @entity8 , the fight did n't end after tempers cooled			2
it simply moved over to the social media website @entity13 , where the war of words in this nasty race continued			1
one of @entity18 's campaign managers , @entity19 , posted a tweet , a short message on @entity13 , that accused @entity7 supporters of starting the fight			1
" check out the video here of @entity28 screaming and heckling , " the tweet said			2
the message included a link to a video that appears to show audience members at the forum shouting down @entity18			2
that same tweet also included a hashtag -- # dumpreid -- made by attaching the # symbol to the message " dumpreid			0
" @entity13 users who clicked on the # dumpreid link were taken to a feed of @entity43 tweets			1
welcome to the new media world of hashtag politics , where the character attack is compressed into 140 characters -- the website 's limit for tweets -- and instantly blasted out to a campaign 's long list of " followers			1
" " it was inevitable that negative politics would transform itself into social media			0
that 's exactly what 's happened , " said @entity58 , the director of the @entity59			0
" you do n't even need a complete sentence to change a campaign -- just a phrase can change a campaign , " @entity58 added			2
why pay for an attack ad when you can post a free attack tweet ? one recent @entity7 attack tweet -- " @entity8 's mocks health coverage for ' autism ' " -- includes a link to a video that shows the @entity9 @entity76 candidate attacking mandates in the new health care law			0
is it the tweet or the video that went viral ? answer : both			0
another @entity18 tweet , " @entity7 's plan to save the @entity5 economy : coked - up stimulus monkeys , " was both acidic and inventive			0
not only did it mock the real use of stimulus money to study the effects of illicit drugs on primates			0
the buzzworthy phrase " coked - up stimulus monkeys " was picked up by political writers across the country			0
campaign staffers are throwing mud via @entity13 too			1
a tweet from an @entity18 campaign staffer refers to @entity7 's handlers as " 13 y / o girls			2
" and on it goes			0
@entity104 , a @entity105 activist and co-creator of the hashtag # @entity108 ( or top conservatives on @entity13 ) said , " i think we 're about to enter a new era of @entity113 political history			1
" @entity104 's " tweeps " ( @entity13 slang for his followers ) who click on # @entity108 are transported to a virtual @entity105 , a nonstop feed where visitors tweet back and forth on the latest news in the conservative movement			1
@entity123 's website , tcotreport.com , ranks the top conservatives by number of followers on @entity13			1
one of those " top conservatives , " former @entity129 gov. @entity128 , has more than 250,000 followers on @entity13			1
her tweets go out not only to her legions of fans , but also to the nation 's top political journalists , who are following @entity128 's every tweet			2
" she can just put out a tweet and generate headlines in the traditional media , " @entity58 said			0
those journalists , many of whom are also prolific @entity13 users , often " retweet " or redistribute @entity128 's tweets to their own lists of followers			1
" the retweeting is how it really gets out there , " @entity58 added , noting that last weekend marked the 50th anniversary of the first debate in the epic 1960 presidential race between @entity152 and @entity153			0

scuffle at @entity159 moved from the campaign event to @entity13
the two campaigns have been *duking* it out online , in 140 characters or less
*mainstream* journalists use politicians ' tweets in stories , retweet them
