-- several years ago , @entity1 and @entity2 and their three kids found themselves running desperately through a busy airport			1
" @entity8 , are we late ? " asks one of the children			2
" i have no idea , just keep running , " says @entity1			2
" but do n't lose @entity10 , because i have no idea what our connecting flight is ! " that family story pretty much sums up the @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 , who arguably rank among @entity21 's most traveling families			1
over the past two decades , the @entity16 have turned the airline getaway into an art form			2
the three children have virtually grown up as international travelers			2
@entity26 was 5 when the family started its flying lifestyle ; @entity30 was a year old and @entity31 was n't even born yet			1
seriously , how many toddlers have their own frequent flier accounts ? while perfecting their travel techniques , [ tips below ] all this globetrotting has opened their minds , widened their experience and bonded them as a family			1
their intangible treasure : a lifetime 's worth of indestructible family memories -- like the time they met an @entity47 " leprechaun , " or when one of them got lost in @entity50 , or that weekend trip to @entity52			1
unimpressed ? maybe we should start with some eye - opening stats : -- since 1990 , the @entity16 have journeyed on 243 family trips , including an estimated 850 flight segments for each family member -- traveling more than 7.5 million miles total , according to @entity58			1
that averages out to about 11 family trips per year over two decades			1
-- their destinations have been as far - flung as @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
-- here 's a fun fact : in two months , they flew through @entity70 's @entity69 on six different days			2
this is a family who " has grown up and together on our flights , " says @entity58 ' @entity75			1
" some people have a cottage or lake house as a second home , the @entity16 have the world			2
" 30 hours in @entity52 if anybody 's to blame for all this it 's @entity2			1
" it all started with a simple ad that showed some promotional deals , " he explained			2
a $ 238 ticket offered triple miles on a particular route			1
" boom ! we were on the plane -- and we had such a priceless experience we said , ' wow let 's do that again			1
' " so they did			2
and again and again -- using their miles for passenger upgrades and to book free trips for extended family members			1
as the @entity16 racked up frequent flier miles , they were collecting airline ticket stubs for destinations in @entity105 , the @entity106 and @entity107			1
in @entity47 , at a stoplight between @entity113 and the @entity114 , " this guy comes to my side of the car banging on the window , " @entity1 remembers			2
" in a way , he reminded us of a little leprechaun , saying , ' are ya goin ' to @entity119 ? oh follow me i 'll show you how to get there			2
' " hopping into a car ahead , " he was so excited and funny			2
as we followed him we were trying to figure out his angle			2
" faith and begorrah ! it turns out the leprechaun 's sister owns a bed and breakfast ! " guess where we stayed that night ? " the @entity16 have even popped across the @entity133 to enjoy a weekend in @entity52			0
that 's right , 30 hours on the ground in @entity65 sandwiched between 50 hours of total flight time			0
" we walked around @entity65 and we actually did see plenty of stuff , " says @entity31 , who is turning 20 this year			0
" i felt like i got a fairly good feel of the city , just in that weekend trip			0
so it did n't feel like a waste			0
" the secret to fun family travel , say the @entity16 , is making the best of time at airports and in the air			1
@entity31 says , " we 've played @entity151 all around the world			0
" @entity31 's misadventure in @entity154 when she was 10 is another family travel story			1
she got separated from her parents briefly in one of the city 's giant , crowded public squares			0
eventually @entity2 and @entity1 found her safe nearby -- with a @entity50 family who had become fascinated with her long , blond hair and were busy snapping photos of her			1
' you just budget ' by now , you may be wondering how a middle - class family affords this jet - setter lifestyle			1
" this is something that 's within the means of a lot of folks , " says @entity2 , a manager at a company that makes construction and mining equipment			1
" @entity1 's job as a registered nurse offers her a schedule that 's flexible for travel			1
this frugal family watches its spending			1
they avoid pricey things like new cars			0
when possible , they keep their travel plans flexible			2
when their flight is overbooked , they sometimes volunteer to give up their seats in exchange for freebies			0
@entity1 offers this bit of advice : " @entity195 and deep breathing work			2
no -- i 'm teasing			0
" @entity31 has another tip for @entity21 traveling in groups : if your companions start embarrassing you , pretend to be @entity202 or @entity52			0
" our family can be pretty loud , " says @entity31			2
" we do n't want @entity21 to look bad			0
" but seriously , here are a few more tips courtesy of the @entity16 : -- plan for the worst , says @entity2			1

traveling with teens : -- let them be in charge of some of the decisions , including where to go next , what to do or where to eat , says @entity2			1

" families change and the @entity16 are no exception			0
