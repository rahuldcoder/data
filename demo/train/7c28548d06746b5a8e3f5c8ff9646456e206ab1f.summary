-- politics abhors a vacuum , and the " @entity12 scandal " engulfing @entity13 has severely compromised the @entity5 governor 's ability to launch a campaign for president , opening a space that @entity9 , the former @entity10 governor , seems likely to fill			1
" the idea that he 's the prohibitive front - runner is over " is how one @entity15 strategist described @entity13 's plight to the conservative @entity17			1
at stake is the future of the @entity15 , which has been divided for several years by a simmering fight between factions -- ultra-conservative @entity26 activists and more moderate establishment figures who control key party offices			0
@entity13 and @entity9 are both frequently mentioned as mainstream candidates that the establishment would like to see run in 2016			1
but @entity13 's status as a party favorite has faltered , while @entity9 appears to be on the rise			1
the contrast was on display at saturday 's @entity39 , the high - profile , televised black - tie event in which the nation 's media and political elites take satirical jabs at one another			0
nobody got rougher treatment from the podium than @entity13 , especially from comedian @entity50 , the evening 's emcee			0
" i promise that tonight will be both amusing and over quickly -- just like @entity13 ' s presidential bid , " quipped @entity50 , who later harped on the apparently politically motivated traffic tie - up near the @entity52 that has led to the firing and resignation of top @entity13 aides			0
" finally , a politician willing to stand up to @entity59 's commuters , " deadpanned @entity50			0
@entity9 , by contrast , escaped with a passing mention as a top presidential contender			0
@entity13 's bad news shows up in polls that ca n't be dismissed as a joke			1
in a recent @entity68 / @entity67 poll of all @entity59 , @entity9 ranked at the top of a list of @entity15 presidential contenders with a 14 % showing ; @entity13 's was 10 %			1
a @entity74 poll taken last month shows that among @entity15 , @entity9 has a 52 % approval rating compared with @entity13 's 46 %			1
after talking with more than 24 top @entity15 donors , reporters from the @entity79 concluded in a recent article that " some of them are signaling to mr. @entity13 's camp that , should mr. @entity9 enter the race , their first loyalty would be to him , not to mr. @entity13			1
" that 's a sea change from recent years , when @entity13 , a prodigious fund - raiser , wielded tight control over his @entity5 donors			2
according to @entity68 commentator @entity90 , when candidate @entity91 came seeking support , in 2011 , @entity13 said he told him : " if you raise money in @entity5 in any kind of aggressive , organized way , it 's going to make it very unlikely that i 'll be able to support you			0
with @entity13 hemorrhaging support , a number of @entity5 heavy hitters are now openly agonizing over whether to stick with @entity13 or invest in a @entity9 candidacy			2
@entity9 brings multiple advantages : having a father and brother who were presidents means there are legions of @entity15 , across multiple generations , who owe personal and political loyalty to the closest thing the @entity15 has to a royal family			2
on the hot - button issue of immigration reform , @entity9 has staked out an independent position , calling on republicans to move away from " harsh rhetoric " on the issue and co-authoring a book on the subject -- an implicit recognition that winning the @entity39 in 2016 will require support from @entity127 and other pro-immigration voters			1
most importantly , @entity9 remains untouched by scandal , while @entity13 must cope with a scandal that just wo n't go away			2
last week , an attorney for @entity132 , a close adviser and mentor of @entity134 , announced that @entity132 will not answer subpoenas from a state legislative committee investigating @entity12 , citing his @entity137 right against self - incrimination			0
it 's another crippling blow to @entity13 's presidential hopes			2
@entity132 , named by @entity13 to serve as chairman of the @entity142 and @entity5 , oversaw the multibillion - dollar agency that runs the @entity52 until he was forced to resign as the scandal unfolded			0
@entity132 is the most prominent among several @entity13 aides who have quit or been fired and have now lawyered up			0
that means we 'll see court fights around memos , meetings and other crucial evidence for months to come -- months during which @entity13 's nascent candidacy will continue to decline , leaving @entity9 looking like the white knight for which the @entity15 establishment has been waiting .			1

@entity157 : " @entity12 " has hurt @entity13 's chances , cleared way for @entity9 in 2016
he says @entity13 and rising @entity9 both seen as moderates in *fractured* @entity15
he says polls favor @entity9 over @entity13 and donors leaning toward @entity166 governor
louis : @entity9 faces no scandal , can appeal to @entity127 on immigration issues
