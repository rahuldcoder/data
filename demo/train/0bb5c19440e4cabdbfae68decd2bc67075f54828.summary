" all we want to do is adopt a highway , " said @entity23 , the chapter 's secretary			2

a federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the @entity4 from participating in the program , and the high court declined to review the case , letting that ruling stand			1

" the @entity136 , which monitors hate groups , lists the @entity4 as " the most infamous -- and oldest -- of @entity68 hate groups			1
