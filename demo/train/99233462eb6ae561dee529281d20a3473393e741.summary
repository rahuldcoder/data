" she was a professor ? " that 's what an astonished caseworker at @entity3 asked about @entity5 when informed of the 83 - year - old woman 's destitute situation , according to an op - ed in the @entity9			2
@entity5 died september 1 of a massive heart attack			2
yes , she was a professor			0
an adjunct professor of @entity12 at @entity13			0
until she was not renewed this year , with neither due process nor severance pay			0
she taught students for 25 years , with no health benefits , no retirement benefits , and low wages			1
the minimum pay for adjunct faculty at @entity13 used to be $ 2500 per course			1
after an ongoing effort by the @entity25 to unionize adjuncts there , the university paid $ 3,500 per course			2
@entity5 's situation was not unusual for adjuncts in academia			2
that is why many have taken the hashtag # @entity35 to tweet their indignation at her working conditions , lack of support and lack of respect			0
the dirty little secret is that higher education is staffed with an insufficiently resourced , egregiously exploited , contingent " new faculty majority			1
" in addition to the 49.3 % of faculty in part - time positions ( 70 % in community colleges ) , another 19 % are full - time , nontenure - track			0
( these numbers do not include graduate assistants or postdocs			0
) adjunct professors , like many hard - working @entity53 , are the working poor			1
they are one step away from " we do n't need your services anymore " or one medical emergency away from being destitute , like @entity5			2
if @entity5 was good enough to be entrusted with teaching @entity13 undergraduates , how can the university justify not providing her ( and her adjunct colleagues ) with health care and other basic benefits ? if @entity53 higher education says to students and society that a college education is the path to the middle class , how can we justify such treatment of these professionals , with advanced degrees , who are teaching the students ? we are living a lie that cheats these professors and the students they teach , particularly in access universities and community colleges where adjunct faculty numbers , like percentages of lower - income students , are highest and instructional spending per student is lowest			1
the story is not just about @entity13			0
certainly , the institution 's wealth ( $ 171 million endowment , tuition over $ 28,000 ) and @entity92 status ( catholic social doctrine supports collective bargaining rights ) make the situation -- and @entity13 's refusal to recognize a union that adjunct faculty voted for overwhelmingly -- particularly indefensible			1
@entity13 's administration has provided a response to the situation , suggesting that there were caring responses by people within the institution to @entity5 's circumstances			0
however , acts of charity are not conditions - of - employment justice for hard - working adjunct professors			1
the larger issues are not about individual responsibility or culpability for actions toward @entity5 , but rather , about collective responsibility for the structural conditions of work that contributed to her circumstances , and that leave significant segments of the academic workforce with no benefits and low pay			2
so @entity13 should recognize the adjunct union , bargain in good faith , grant benefits and set up a professional development fund in @entity5 's name			1
but this story speaks more broadly about a horrible reality in higher education			1
adjunct professors , as part of a growing army of working poor , are at the center of the academic labor movement , just as fast - food workers are now at the center of the larger labor movement			1
we are in the midst of deciding the extent to which we are an inclusive society that will live up to our nation 's promise that hard work pays off			0
the question is : how will we treat working people ? will we , the richest nation on earth , continue to structure employment in ways that reduce large segments of society to near @entity158 conditions of existence ? or can we muster the collective will to appropriately remunerate and honor the work of all working @entity53 ? in academia , that means tenure stream faculty , staff , students , administrators , and communities must recognize in @entity5 's fate the ugly and diminished future of higher education and choose , in big ways and small ways , a more equitable path			1
adjunct professors have taken initiatives to change the status quo			1
some have joined advocacy groups , such as the @entity180			0
some are involved with caucuses within unions and professional associations where they gather data about pay and working conditions , define best practices , and work to ensure that adjunct faculty are not discriminated against			1
adjuncts are organizing for benefits , a living wage , and conditions that will benefit their students and their schools			0
in @entity201 , as in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , and @entity200 , there are union campaigns for adjunct unions in private ( often wealthy ) universities			0
there is also much organizing in public institutions , and in units that combine adjunct with full - time and tenure track faculty			0
no one deserves the treatment and fate experienced by @entity5 , who escaped the 21st century equivalent of @entity217 poorhouses in a cardboard casket			0
@entity53 higher education can and should do better for those who teach our students .			2

@entity5 , who taught at a university for 25 years , died in *poverty*
@entity227 : adjunct professors are paid very little and have no benefits
he says the dirty secret in higher education is that adjuncts are used a lot
@entity227 : adjunct faculty do not deserve to be the new working poor in society
