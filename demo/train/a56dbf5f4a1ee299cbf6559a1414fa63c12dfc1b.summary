@entity0 -- a spirited and leaderless protest in the @entity4 section of @entity0 has entered its third week , helping to inspire a growing number of demonstrations united in their passion if not necessarily their reasons for hitting the streets			1
the hub of the movement , in @entity12 , was abuzz with activity on sunday as activists continued to vent their frustrations with everything from " corporate greed " to high gas prices to insufficient health insurance			1
no single group or person heads the effort , which has adopted the name " @entity24			1
" while a " general assembly " is held daily for those gathered -- be it for a few short hours or by camping out long - term -- to discuss the goings - on and work toward a common mission , the stances being touted currently are diverse			0
" we 've gathered here in this place ... to shape a statement of what it is we want , and how we 're going to get to it , " said @entity32 , one of the @entity0 protesters			2
video : police arrest hundreds of protesters in @entity0 the lack of coherent message has not stopped similar efforts from popping up elsewhere in the @entity46			1
" @entity50 , " for instance , entered its 10th day on sunday , a day after an associated website touted " a huge afternoon march			0
" the motto atop a website for " @entity53 , " which kicked off saturday with a march from @entity55 to @entity56 , reads : " the revolution is happening ... it 's just not in the news			0
" there are 34 organizations -- from unions to ethnic organizations to activist groups focused on everything from foreclosure prevention to climate change to justice - related issues -- listed as being involved in a like - minded activist coalition in @entity70			1
this group , which held a festival and march friday and saturday and has explicitly targeted @entity73 in recent weeks , states on its website that its aim is to " stop their greed , " " fight for an economy that works for all of us " and " build cities that are democratic , just and sustainable			2
" the website of @entity83 demonstrators describes the nationwide effort as " a leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors , genders and political persuasions			1
" " the one thing we all have in common is that we are the 99 % that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 % , " the statement continues , referring to what it sees as a sharp divide between the wealthiest @entity46 and the rest of society			0
most demonstrations thus far have been peaceful and uneventful , though in a few cases they have led to numerous arrests			0
the most high - profile such incident came saturday , when @entity0 police arrested more than 700 protesters who had occupied the iconic @entity109			2
they were cited for blocking the roadway , authorities said , and eventually released after being given tickets			0
the confrontation came as protesters along the road banged drums and chanted , " the whole world is watching " as police moved in			2
@entity118 , the deputy commissioner for the @entity119 , said they were given " multiple warnings " to stay on the pedestrian walkway and not the main roadway			0
the incident led to a shutdown of @entity12 - to - @entity109 traffic for several hours			1
demonstrators have said they take their inspiration from the @entity130 protests that swept through @entity131 and the @entity132 this year			0
the protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag # occupywallstreet on the microblogging site @entity136 -- began in july with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march and a sit - in at the @entity141			1
it has gained steam since early september , with crowds taking up residence in a park in @entity0 's financial district and calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a " few months			1
" in recent weeks , the @entity0 demonstrators have addressed various issues , including police brutality , union busting and the economy			0
@entity1 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
