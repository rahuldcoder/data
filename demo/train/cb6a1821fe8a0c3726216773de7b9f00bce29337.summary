-- a fire - breathing dragon , self - stirring cauldrons and dancing skeletons			0
these are the things @entity6 dreams are made of			0
but they wo n't be dreams much longer			0
this summer , @entity8 will open the doors , or rather the secret entrance , to @entity11 -- @entity12 at @entity13			1
once inside the elaborately themed area , which has been in the works since the summer of 2010 , guests will feel like they 've stepped onto the @entity18 film set , complete with the popular wizarding pub @entity20 , several iconic shops and a marquee roller coaster - type attraction based on @entity23 , the goblin - run bank from the series			1
the @entity11 -- @entity27 , which opened in june 2010 at @entity28 , was one of the most talked about new attractions of the past decade within the industry and has been wildly popular ever since			1
by august 2010 , @entity32 and the @entity33 , the star attraction at @entity27 , hit a million riders			1
parent company @entity36 reported a theme park revenue increase of more than 30 % in 2010 , thanks in large part to the @entity41 's opening that year			2
in 2011 , theme park revenue jumped again by nearly 25 % , followed by a modest gain in 2012 of about 5 %			2
" park operators from around the world were impressed by the immersive experience @entity36 created and the meticulous attention to detail they used to bring the @entity32 stories to life , " says @entity44 , vice president of communications for the @entity45			1
" there is great anticipation within the industry to see how @entity12 will build on that success			1
" @entity0 got a tour of the 20 - acre construction site , which roughly doubles the size of the @entity32 experience , where thousands of designers , engineers and craftspeople are hard at work preparing for opening day			1
here are some things to know : it 's hidden : the outside of this attraction is a hodgepodge of building facades built to scale , including the @entity71 , @entity73 's tube station and @entity74 , which mask the entrance to @entity12			1
here , guests will be able to meander along the @entity18 waterfront , sit under the shade of trees and gaze at a replica of @entity18 's @entity82 fountain			1
guests will enter under the arches of the @entity73 facade			0
however , @entity36 has not said how exactly			0
in the series , @entity32 enters @entity12 through a magical wall of bricks			1
once inside , guests will be immediately immersed in a bustling wizarding hub within a @entity6 city where towering buildings are slightly askew , with steep staircases and jagged edges galore			2
there will be goblins : the star of it all is @entity23 , which in the series is a massive , goblin - run bank that @entity32 visits to get money for his school supplies			1
in the real - life version , visitors will be in awe of the marble lobby and cavernous passageways			0
they 'll take off from here on a multi-sensory thrill ride through the vaults			0
and the dragon that will perch atop the bank building ( reminiscent of when it escapes from the bank in the series ) really does blow a giant ball of fire quite frequently , says @entity118 , president of @entity119			0
your ticket to @entity122 gives you access to @entity12 : admission into @entity13 ( $ 92 for adults and $ 86 for kids ages 3 to 9 ) , allows you to roam around the park and visit @entity12			1
however , if you 'd like to pop over to @entity27 via the @entity128 , you must purchase park - to - park admission ( $ 128 for adults , $ 122 for kids ages 3 to 9 )			1
the train , where @entity32 meets pals @entity135 and @entity136 in the first movie , will shuttle people over to @entity27 in @entity28			1
along the way , rather than seeing backstage areas between the parks , guests will see views of @entity18 and the @entity144 countryside thanks to some high - tech features			2
it goes beyond the books / films : @entity149 provided @entity36 with names that did n't exist in the book			0
for instance , in @entity12 , visitors will find @entity154 and @entity155 next to @entity156 and the train trellis			1
although the world - famous author has not toured the site yet , " she has been involved as usual in the development process and has been a great supporter throughout the process as she was in the original in 2010 , " says @entity118			2
" just a delight to work with and a wonderful author			0
and someone we are eternally grateful to for creating a body of fiction that is so rich that gives us an opportunity to develop what we 've been able to do			0
" there will be new merchandise and foods : all the bits and bobs that any good wizard needs will , of course , be available			0
shops will include madam @entity184 's @entity183 for all occasions for @entity128 scarves and character costumes ; the three - story @entity190 ' @entity189 shop for magical jokes and toys ; the @entity193 for owl and @entity195 stuffed animals ; @entity197 for brooms and quaffles and more			2
wand shop @entity200 will be there , too			0
( note : the @entity200 location found within @entity12 is the original location , as referenced in the @entity32 books and films			1
this shop will be larger than the current one found within @entity27 at @entity28			1
) @entity20 , a popular wizarding pub and inn from the series , will be a " colossal space " serving @entity211 and traditional @entity213 pub fare			2
nearby , @entity215 's @entity214 will serve weird flavors like strawberry with peanut butter			0
it will blow @entity27 away : " we think the experience is exponential , " says @entity118			2
" it 's not just one and one is two			0
in this case , it 's one and one is six			0
" actor @entity227 , who plays @entity228 in the films , concurs : " it 's ridiculous , " @entity227 said after touring the site yesterday			0
" the scale of it , it 's just enormous			0
