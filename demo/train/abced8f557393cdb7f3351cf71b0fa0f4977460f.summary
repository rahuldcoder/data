@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 militant group in northern @entity1 has claimed responsibility for attacks that killed at least 25 people in a rash of violence against the country 's minority @entity10 , officials said , after it issued an earlier ultimatum that gave @entity10 three days to leave the area			1
gunmen opened fire on residents friday , killing at least 15 people who were mourning the deaths of two slain businessmen , said rev. @entity23 , chairman of the @entity24			1
at least eight people were also killed on thursday in a church shooting in northeastern @entity1 , a pastor at the church said , as sectarian violence spirals and the country is shaken by angry protests over fuel subsidies			1
gunmen attacked the @entity34 in @entity35 , the capital of @entity36 , thursday evening as worshipers held a prayer meeting , according to the @entity39 , a pastor with the @entity41 of @entity35			1
he said at least 20 people were being treated at a hospital , one of whom is in intensive care			2
" many tried to run but were gunned down , " eyewitness @entity48 said			1
" i was just outside the church when the men came and started shooting , and i ran			0
" police said the militant group @entity53 claimed responsibility for both attacks , but @entity2 could not immediately confirm the claims			1
the church targeted in @entity35 is attended predominantly by @entity10 from southern @entity1			1
@entity53 has been blamed for months of widespread bloodshed in @entity1 , with churches and police stations among the targets			1
the group also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on churches on christmas day			1
the rising tide of violence led @entity1 president @entity69 to declare a partial state of emergency in four northern states , in a bid to contain @entity53 , whose name means " @entity76 education is a sin			1
" the latest sectarian attack comes as @entity1 also faces a nationwide wave of popular protests over the removal of a gas subsidy that had kept prices artificially low			1
what is behind @entity1 fuel protests ? @entity87 leaders have called for a national strike beginning monday if the government does not reverse the decision , which resulted in the cost of a liter of gasoline more than doubling virtually overnight			1
furious @entity1 have already taken to the streets this week , staging " @entity98 " protests and mass demonstrations across the country , and there have been calls from some quarters for the president to be impeached			1
are you there ? send your images or video @entity1 , an oil - rich nation of about 167 million people , is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world , and citizens complain that the money saved by ending the fuel subsidy is highly likely to be siphoned off by a few and salted away into offshore accounts			2
the government has said the money will be used to fund infrastructure projects , such as building refineries so @entity1 can produce its own gasoline rather than having to import it			0
tires burn , protesters flood @entity121 @entity122 , with the @entity123 at @entity125 - based think tank @entity124 , told @entity2 the two issues together -- the sectarian violence and the fuel subsidy protests -- present the biggest challenge yet for @entity69 , who was elected president last year after taking the reins in 2010 when the former president died			1
although the government struck a blow against @entity53 in 2009 with the capture of its leader , @entity137 , it has since become more of a " franchise , " or umbrella organization , for the actions of individual groups , making it harder to manage the problem , @entity122 said			2
protesters make demands known " we can trace these sorts of attacks to issues of underdevelopment , poverty , lack of resources and so on			2
the fact that it 's framed in religious language is worrying , " she said , particularly given the sectarian violence that has broken out in @entity1 in recent years			1
the country 's leadership needs to rise above politics and use the kind of language that will bridge the growing gap between different parts of @entity1 society , she said , rather than just treating the problem as a security issue			0
but the challenge of restoring calm will be compounded by a widely felt skepticism toward government , from a population too used to corruption and political maneuvering			0
that skepticism has grown since @entity69 came to power , @entity122 said , in part because of his lack of governing experience			0
the fact that he is southern also plays into tensions between the mainly @entity182 north and predominantly @entity24 and animist south			0
" it 's a very challenging time for @entity1 , and for @entity69 , it 's a very interesting moment			0
it could be when he and his team really prove themselves -- or where everybody 's suspicions about his lack of ability could be proved right , " she said			0
resolving the tough times should n't be solely up to @entity69 's government , though , @entity122 added			0
state and local administrations , as well as religious leaders , must also play a part in resolving tensions			0
meanwhile , the fuel subsidy protests could prove a trigger for wider violence , she warned , as the large crowds may become targets for people who want to launch attacks			1
clashes could also break out between protesters and police			0
and while not directly linked , the two issues have common threads that must be tackled if calm is to be restored , she said			0
" the reason the protests are happening is that so many @entity1 live such difficult lives			2
they do n't have a lot of money , they do worry about putting food on the table , and the smallest change in fuel prices makes an enormous difference to them , " she said			2
" @entity53 has grown in a region where there 's very little in the way of development and public services , and not much in the way of industry or opportunity			2
" @entity1 is really grappling with these issues at the moment , both political and economic			0
it is a developing democracy , and these issues are part of it creating this new identity			0
" @entity241 , co-director of @entity242 at the @entity243 , agrees that economic discontent is at the heart of the unrest , in a country where many live on less than $ 2 a day and are less well - off than their grandparents			0
" it 's people who are fed up , the have - nots seeing the haves continue to do well at their expense , " she told @entity2 from @entity250			0
" the core issue is not @entity53 , and @entity10 versus @entity182 , it 's economic inequality -- and unless and until the government is able to address that , they will continue to have these tensions increase			2
" journalist @entity261 in @entity0 , and @entity2 's @entity262 and @entity263 in @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
