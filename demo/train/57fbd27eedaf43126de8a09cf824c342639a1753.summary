@entity0 -- investigative documents obtained by @entity1 show that former @entity4 gov. @entity3 , his wife and his staff may have given preferential treatment to two of the convicted murderers who were among the more than 200 former and current inmates he pardoned in january			1
according to the documents compiled by the office of @entity4 's attorney general , the state 's former first lady , @entity12 , apparently called a car dealership regarding the purchase of two vehicles for two convicted murderers -- days before they were pardoned			1
the cars were later delivered to the governor 's mansion , two days before the men were released			1
@entity1 has also learned that a member of the governor 's staff took the same two men , @entity29 and @entity30 , to get their driver 's licenses while they were still in state custody , before their pardons were signed and made official			1
" yes , that 's true ... i did take some of them , " said @entity3 's former security chief , @entity36			1
" i knew that they were going to be paroled			2
i was assured of that and i just took them to get their driver 's licenses			1
" i thought that if i went ahead to get them a driver 's license it would speed things up on getting them a job			1
and that was the only reason			0
i was just trying to help them			0
" @entity36 , who retired as security director of the @entity4 governor 's mansion when @entity3 left office in january , told @entity1 the former @entity4 governor did not ask him to take @entity29 and @entity30 to get their licenses			1
" no , i assume full responsibility for it , " he said			0
@entity36 admitted his actions were a bit unusual			0
state law enforcement experts and legal experts told @entity1 that while this would be considered preferential treatment for any inmate , no state laws were violated			1
" unless a person has had his or her license revoked ... they are not prohibited from acquiring or renewing a driver 's license while incarcerated as long as they had domicile in the state prior to imprisonment , " according to a written statement from @entity75 spokesman master sgt. @entity74			1
@entity74 said his department was not aware of any directive from @entity3 to provide licenses to the men			0
either way , @entity80 is furious			0
nearly 20 years ago , he survived a gunshot wound to the head by @entity29 moments after @entity29 killed @entity85 , @entity29 's estranged wife			1
@entity29 admitted he shot her in the head as she held their 6 - week - old child in her arms			0
police found the infant , still in her arms , alive and covered with blood			0
" where is enough enough ? " said @entity80 , who has recovered from his head wound			0
" it should be enough that they gave a convicted killer his life back			0
" during his last days in office in january , gov. @entity3 issued pardons to more than 200 current and former inmates			0
most of the pardons were granted to former inmates who had already completed their sentences and were free			0
however , some of the prisoners were convicted murderers			2
now , the legacy of the once popular two - term governor , who considered running for the 2012 @entity112 presidential nomination , is being questioned by some @entity4			1
the pardons were challenged by @entity4 's attorney general , but last week the @entity115 upheld the legality of the pardons			1
five of the prisoners -- including @entity29 and @entity30 -- worked as trusties as part of a state rehabilitation program that allows model prisoners to work as servants and handymen at the governor 's mansion			1
they had access to @entity3 practically every day , according to people familiar with the program			0
@entity3 has said he believes the men are no longer a threat , that they are rehabilitated and deserve a second chance at life			0
" that 's what we as @entity138 believe			2
my wife and i are @entity138 , " he told @entity1 's @entity142 on his show , " @entity142 , @entity145 , " weeks after issuing the pardons			1
" when we have people who get rehabilitated ... they deserve a second chance			0
it 's the governor 's job and the governor 's job alone to let them have a second chance			1
that 's why i 'm very comfortable with this			2
" but no matter how one looks at this story , the benefits these convicted murderers received appear special			1
" it 's abhorrent that these people would be given this sort of treatment after the crimes they 've committed , " said @entity161 rep. @entity160			1
@entity160 , a @entity167 , sponsored several bills to change @entity4 's pardons process			1
the bills all died in committee last week			0
he said the victims in the cases have put up with too much already			2
" not only to turn these folks loose but to treat them like kings , essentially -- it 's outside the bounds of common decency of what we expect of our government , " he told @entity1			2
@entity29 and @entity30 were released on january 8			0
they both had driver 's licenses when they went to @entity185 in @entity0 , @entity4 , on january 6			1
records show @entity30 bought a white 2007 @entity187 while @entity29 picked up a gray @entity188			0
both vehicles were paid for with bank checks from @entity191			0
both men put no money down			0
it remains unclear how the men were able to secure bank checks while still in the custody of the @entity197			0
when reached by @entity1 at the dealership , the salesman who sold the men the cars refused to comment			1
" i am not allowed to speak about any transactions , " he said			0
but the investigative reports compiled by @entity4 's attorney general 's office show that @entity3 's wife , @entity12 , aided the transaction			1
in the report , the investigator writes , " while at the dealership i spoke briefly with the salesman who stated that @entity12 had contacted him regarding the purchase of vehicles for @entity30 and @entity29			1
" the details of the conversation were not available and it is not clear exactly what role @entity12 played in the transaction , or the nature of her relationship with the pardoned men			1
the report further stated that " the inmates had been brought to the dealership on january 6 , 2012 , in a black @entity223 to complete paperwork for the sale and [ the investigator ] stated that the prisoners had paid with certified checks issued by @entity191			2
" according to the report , the car salesman also told investigators " he delivered both vehicles to the governor 's mansion on the afternoon of january 6 , 2012			1
" when investigators asked @entity29 how he got the car , he allegedly told them , according to the report , " i ca n't tell you			0
" when asked about the driver 's licenses and the role of @entity12 in the purchase of the cars , a spokeswoman for the former governor said the questions " were based on assumptions of fact which simply are not true			1
" spokeswoman @entity248 did not elaborate on which aspects of this story were untrue , and has not responded to @entity1 's questions for clarification			2
@entity80 , the victim who stared down the barrel of @entity29 's gun before he was shot in the head , said he 's " baffled " by the allegations and believes @entity3 is financially helping the men			2
" was it because he was a trusty at the governor 's mansion and he had so much time with @entity3 ? " he wondered			1
" it 's insane that he would do that			2
where 's my handout ? " " i mean , i had thousands upon thousands of medical bills that nobody helped me pay			2
i 'd like to get some of that money back that i wasted because @entity29 shot me			0
i did n't ask for @entity29 to come shoot me			0
where 's my handout ? " he asked angrily			2
@entity1 went to @entity30 's home in @entity0 several times and saw the @entity276 mentioned in the state investigator 's report parked outside his house , but @entity30 did not answer his door or respond to @entity1 's phone calls			2
according to the investigative reports from the @entity4 attorney general 's office , @entity30 allegedly told investigators that his son helped him buy the vehicle , and that his son had already made three months of car payments for him			1
@entity1 also went to @entity289 to try to get @entity29 's side of the story , and found him living in the home of @entity293			2
his gray @entity188 was in the driveway , but @entity293 said @entity29 refused to talk to us			0
but @entity80 has a lot to say			0
he can barely contain his anger that the man who tried to kill him could get such preferential treatment			1
" i 've been trying for over two years , since 2009 , to get a face to face with @entity3 , and never got a phone call back , " said @entity80			0
" @entity29 must have made quite the impression on him			0
