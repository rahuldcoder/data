-- four years ago , lobster fisherman @entity1 had never laid eyes on a lionfish , but today his traps are full of them			1
" you 'll get two or three decent traps with lobster , but if you get four or five lionfish , the lobster do n't like it , " @entity6 said			2
he says he catches so many lionfish now ( up to 200 pounds every day ) that he 's started to sell them			2
but where his lobsters sell for $ 16 per kilogram , lionfish only make him $ 12			2
lionfish are causing a huge strain on his business and the wider commercial fishing industry in @entity21 , devouring other fish populations -- in some cases reducing them by up to 90 %			1
according to the @entity21 's @entity24 , lionfish are native to the @entity27 and @entity26 , but were accidentally introduced into @entity29 and @entity30 waters during the 1990s			1
with no natural predators in the @entity29 and an ability to reproduce year - round , their numbers have risen unabated in recent years			1
not only are lionfish causing grief for lobster fishermen like @entity6 , they are also threatening to upset the balance of the fragile reef ecosystem			1
" what we 've found through stomach analysis and working with fish that have been collected is that they are consuming a wide variety of prey , " said @entity42 , director of special projects for @entity44 , a marine conservation group			0
" they are eating almost anything that fits in their mouth			0
the lionfish can probably consume in excess of half of its own body size			2
they can take quite large prey , " he added			0
some of what they eat are commercially valuable species , says @entity42 , like juvenile grouper and snapper that the fishermen depend on			1
ecologically important species like mudfish which graze on algae , stopping it growing over the reefs , are also being impacted , he says			2
" i 'm an optimist but potential impacts of lionfish could result in major shifts in the ecology of our @entity30 and @entity80 reef barriers , " @entity42 said			1
" it could result in the extinction of some fish species			2
" in an effort to minimize their impact , reef run a monthly contest , open to both businesses and individuals , awarding prizes to those who catch the most lionfish			1
it also run workshops educating divers about safe collection and removal techniques			0
the @entity100 's @entity99 has also joined the fight with a campaign that encourages people to eat lionfish			1
its " if we ca n't beat them , let 's eat them ! " slogan has been taken up by restaurants like the @entity110 in @entity111			2
general manager @entity112 has been serving lionfish for the past 18 months			0
" we 're putting it on the menu to try to get them off the reef and try to get people to actually like them and enjoy them , " @entity112 said			1
" there is a little bit of fear factor eating them			0
but once they know that the flesh has no poison , they 're ok with it and want to try it			0
" by encouraging more people to eat lionfish , @entity112 hopes to entice fishermen to get them out of the ocean			1
once cooked , the venomous spines are harmless and @entity134 , chef at @entity135 , says the response from customers has been very encouraging			0
" in the beginning it was sort of more like a novelty			0
but those who tried it have spoken well of it , " @entity134 said			0
@entity6 , who has spent over a quarter of a century fishing the waters off @entity21 , remains philosophical about the threat , speculating it could be cyclical and that nature usually finds a way to adapt			1
" maybe it 's just taking its time , " he said			0
" but it 's really strange			0
i mean , having fished all my life , it 's just hard to believe that in a short space of time something like this can happen			0
