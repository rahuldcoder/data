-- here 's a poke to users and nonusers of @entity4 : " @entity10 " is n't some yawny visual aid on how the website grew from a few hundred users at @entity8 in 2004 to a 2010 global reach of half a billion			1
" @entity10 " is a hard - charging beast of a movie with a full tank of creative gas that keeps it humming from start to finish ( hell of a middle , too			1
) sure , it gives you the facts about how then - @entity8 undergrad @entity23 ( a never - better @entity24 ) made billions by helping technology win the battle against actual human contact			2
but it 's also about the nation of narcissists we 've become , reshaping who we are on @entity4 in the hope of being friended by other users who may or may not be lying their asses off			1
bracingly smart , brutally funny and acted to perfection without exception , " @entity10 " lights up a dim movie sky with flares of startling brilliance			1
director @entity53 ( " @entity52 , " " seven , " " @entity54 " ) puts his visual mastery to work on the verbal pyrotechnics in the dynamite , d -- k - swinging script by @entity47 ( " @entity48 " ) , and they both do the best and ballsiest work of their careers			1
" @entity10 " gets you drunk on movies again			1
it deserves to go viral			2
the truth about @entity4 : the @entity0 story that exposed the battle for @entity4 in the film 's wow of an opener , set in 2003 , @entity47 speculatively places @entity23 at a campus bar , where he is driving his girlfriend nuts by avoiding eye contact , juggling a dozen topics at once and ignoring her reaction to virtually everything			1
she is @entity71 , and as played like a gathering storm by @entity73 , winner of the coveted title role in @entity53 's " @entity75 , " she is steaming			1
it 's a setup for disaster : tech nerd versus the real live girl from @entity80 he uses to unload on			0
@entity87 up with his condescension and his obsession with getting into one of @entity8 's elite " final clubs , " @entity71 calls him an asshole and splits			0
a shattered @entity23 returns to the dorm he shares with @entity91 ( @entity92 ) and @entity93 ( @entity94 ) , and , beer in hand , blogs out his festering rage , attacking @entity71 as a flat - chested bitch , hacking into photo files of female @entity8 undergrads and ranking them on a hotness scale			0
out of anger over being socially rejected , a social network is born			0
the twelve must - see fall movies : @entity107 runs down a golden dozen and five flicks to skip who gets the credit / blame ? there 's no doubt @entity23 is the ceo of a @entity4 complex currently valued at $ 25 billion			1
but do n't forget his bff , @entity118 student @entity117 ( @entity119 ) , who provided the business plan and early financing			1
and then there 's the memorable @entity125 twins , @entity126 and @entity127 ( both played by @entity128 , with @entity129 doing duty as a body double )			0
the @entity133 , as @entity23 calls them , are blond vikings on the @entity8 rowing crew and , in their eyes , the originators of @entity4			1
they were the ones who asked @entity23 to help them build a @entity8 computer - dating service			0
they all successfully sued for a piece of the pie they claim that @entity23 the @entity146 screwed them out of when he took his idea to @entity149 and global dominance			0
not a drop of blood is spilled in " @entity10 , " but you ca n't miss the scar tissue			1
get more news , reviews and interviews from @entity107 on the travers take as advertised , it 's a tale of sex , money , genius and betrayal			0
but can a script based on what @entity23 calls " fiction " dig out the truth ? the film 's maverick producer , @entity168 , paraphrasing a line from @entity47 's " @entity171 , " argues that " there is no such thing as the truth			1
" he has a point			0
that 's why @entity47 , using research compiled by journalist @entity177 for his book " @entity179 , " written concurrently with the script , went to court depositions of @entity23 , @entity182 and the @entity133 and created a fact - based structure that gives the movie multiple points of view			2
the " @entity188 " idea is inspired , and @entity53 directs it with thrilling cinematic fervor			2
how ? by effectively giving each character his own @entity4 page			2
watch the movie and decide who you want to add as a friend			0
it wo n't be easy			0
@entity47 and @entity53 come down hard on these characters , without skimping on complexity and sympathy			1
@entity24 delivers a tour de force , nimbly negotiating @entity47 's rat - a - tat dialogue and revealing how alienation and loneliness actually fuel @entity23 's ambition			2
more crucially , @entity24 lets us see the chinks in @entity23 's armor , unearthing long - buried feelings when @entity211 co-founder @entity210 ( @entity212 ) enters the scene , ready to take @entity4 to the next level even if it means leaving @entity117 behind as roadkill			1
@entity212 is phenomenal , a revelation , even			0
you expect him to nail @entity210 's charming hustle , and he does , working a restaurant meeting with @entity23 and @entity117 like a twentysomething @entity221			2
" a million dollars is n't cool , " he says			0
" you know what 's cool ? a billion dollars			0
" @entity224 : share your review of " @entity10 " in one photo @entity210 , with a rep for drugs and very young women , sinks his hooks in			2
he 's a seductive @entity232 to @entity23 's ego - bruised @entity233			0
it 's a role to die for , and @entity212 the mesmerizer just crushes it			0
note to @entity236 : you need to step up big time for @entity119 , who plays @entity117 with a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie that is built on ice cool , a fact reflected in the haunting visuals achieved digitally by gifted cinematographer @entity245 and the hypnotic musical road map laid out by @entity247 and @entity248			1
was @entity23 jealous that the @entity8 final club that rejected him accepted @entity117 ? keep your eyes on @entity119 -- he 's shatteringly good , the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one			1
" @entity10 " is the movie of the year			2
but @entity53 and @entity47 triumph by taking it further			1
lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness , they define the dark irony of the past decade			0
the final image of solitary @entity23 at his computer has to resonate for a generation of users ( the drug term seems apt ) sitting in front of a glowing screen pretending not to be alone			0
