@entity0 -- what has happened to my country ? this last fortnight has made me feel like a foreigner in my own home as a collective wave of happy - clappy good will descended on this once curmudgeonly isle			1
where has our natural suspicion of organized fun gone , our disdain for overt displays of emotion , our celebration of hapless failures			1
it 's easier for my fellow cynics , most of whom probably fled these shores long before the official sponsors parked their corporate juggernauts on our lawns and the athletes arrived for the glorified sports day known as the @entity30			2
but i had to remain in @entity0 to help with @entity1 's coverage of the spectacle , and boy was it tough seemingly being in a minority of one			2
the singer morrissey reliably poured his usual words of scorn on the parade , criticizing the " blustering jingoism			2
" he added : " has @entity42 ever been quite so foul with patriotism ? " but while i secretly sympathized with him , i bet he did n't have to run the gauntlet of thousands of smiling flag - waving enthusiasts on @entity0 's public transport system every day of the @entity30			2
it was bad enough in 1997 , following the death of @entity51 , when a similar wave of hysteria overtook @entity54			1
then , complete strangers cried together and hugged each other in the street , as they mourned a pampered princess whom they had never met			0
commentators opined on page after page that @entity54 had entered a new era in which adults were able to discuss the hitherto taboo issue of emotions in public			1
many of us hoped they were wrong			1
but this time it 's far , far worse			0
not only are we all supposed to rejoice that Â £ 9 billion of taxpayers ' money has been spent tarting up part of east @entity0 that i have never visited and now have even less reason to go there , we must all celebrate and cry uncontrollably when sports men and women win events that i have never even heard of			0
@entity79 fours ? taekwondo ? handball ? i would n't have minded if there were real sports in the @entity30 -- crazy golf , kite - flying , staring contests to name just three of my favorites -- but many of the events that really took place are just crazy			0
before the @entity30 , i was quite hopeful that something would go marvelously wrong in the @entity54 tradition			1
we 'd got the dates wrong , and it 's actually taking place next year			1
the swimming pool would spring a leak			0
the medals had n't been made			0
but oh no , everything went to plan -- it did n't even rain -- and suddenly we 're a " nation at ease with itself			0
" but before you board your flight home and hail @entity54 's flawless organization skills , spare a thought for curmudgeons like me			1
and now you 've had your fun , please make sure you clear up all your mess , and turn out the lights			0
the show 's over ! normal service can resume .			0
