-- @entity1 was always mindful that his leadership role in the liberation of @entity4 from apartheid might not have been possible if he had not been imprisoned			1
" it is possible that if i had not gone to jail and been able to read and listen to the stories of many people			0
... i might not have learned these things , " @entity1 said of the insights that he gained during his 27 years in jail			1
in an interview less than a year after he had stepped down as the country 's first black president , @entity1 shared with me reflections of how prison changed him			1
he said that reading the biographies of great leaders who had been able to overcome their shortcomings and rise to do great things had inspired him			0
he said it also helped him to realize that behind every seemingly ordinary person lay the potential of greatness			0
" i have been surprised a great deal sometimes when i see somebody who looks less than ordinary , but when you talk to the person and they open their mouths , they are something completely different , " he said			0
@entity1 said that prison gave him time to think about the times when he had failed to acknowledge people who had been kind to him			1
@entity1 said that at the height of the struggle against apartheid , he and other leaders were understandably angry at the humiliation and loss of dignity of those who suffered under the unjust policy			1
it meant their actions were driven by anger and emotion rather than by reflection and consultation			0
" but in jail -- especially for those who stayed in single cells -- you had enough opportunity to sit down and think , " he said			0
there was time to listen to the stories of people who were highly educated and who were widely traveled and experienced			0
" when they told of their experiences , you felt humbled , " he said			0
@entity1 said that he had learned that when you had the moral high ground , it was better to sit down and talk to people and persuade them of the correctness of your cause			2
" if you have an objective in life , then you want to concentrate on that and not engage in infighting with your enemies , " he said			0
" you want to create an atmosphere where you can move everybody toward the goal you have set for yourself , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 : a man of many handshakes in his twilight , @entity1 was at pains to publish and acknowledge his weaknesses and shortcomings in his family life , in his relationships with women and his first wife , @entity87			2
he was keen to dispel any notion of sainthood that might be bestowed on him			0
he also spoke increasingly about the importance of changing oneself			0
" one of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself , " @entity1 said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman @entity93 who had made his @entity95 residence available to @entity1 as a retreat after his prison release in 1990			1
@entity1 had given similar advice to wife @entity103 in a letter written to her in 1981 after she had been jailed by the apartheid regime			1
@entity1 noted that there were qualities " in each one of us " that form the basis of our spiritual life and that we can change ourselves by observing our reactions to the unfolding of life			1
ten years later , @entity1 said that it gave him a feeling of fulfillment to see that @entity93 had changed and had learned to share his resources with the poor			1
" it enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that i am changing myself " by reconciling with former adversaries , @entity1 said			2
i believe that the essence of @entity1 's greatness was to change himself fundamentally during his period in jail and emerge as a potent leader and example for all humanity			1
opinion : @entity1 saved my life the reflections took me back to the extraordinary day of @entity1 's release			1
the day the legend became a man			0
even now , the moment seems frozen in time			0
it was february 11 , 1990 , and the @entity4 sun shone from a clear blue sky on a windless summer 's day in @entity142			1
about an hour 's drive from the city , the international media thronged around the entrance of a neat prison warder 's house to await the emergence of one of the century 's most iconic figures			2
i had arrived late at the prison and wandered unnoticed into the prison grounds where my slate - blue cotton suit coincidentally blended in with the uniform color of the @entity4 police			1
that might have had something to do with the fact that i was not challenged when i strode confidently into the prison grounds			0
but to this day i do not know			0
an unscheduled wait of an hour while @entity1 consulted an anti-apartheid delegation including his wife @entity103 , who had arrived an hour late , seemed like an eternity			2
when @entity1 , flanked by @entity103 , finally emerged walking down the driveway towards the prison premise gates , i lost all sense of time and self and strode towards @entity1 to shake his hand and congratulate him on his freedom			1
he recognized me from the photograph that accompanied my regular column i had written for the @entity175 , where i often analyzed the successes and setbacks of the anti-apartheid movement and the @entity179 in exile			0
his face broke into a broad smile as we shook hands and he continued his historic walk to freedom			0
at the time , i was the southern @entity4 correspondent for the @entity187 which was for many years the only international news publication that @entity1 was allowed to read in jail albeit in a vetted form with pages and sections frequently removed			1
on his first visit to the @entity194 in 1990 , @entity1 broke from his official program on sunday , june 24 to pay an unscheduled visit to the headquarters of the monitor at one @entity199 street in @entity200 to the astonishment of the editor and staff			2
( today the monitor is online only			0
the newspaper ceased daily publication in 2009			0
) @entity4 since apartheid : boom or bust ? i received an incredulous call from my foreign editor , @entity209 , on that sunday asking me if i could guess who was standing outside the building with two bodyguards asking to see the editor			1
it was , she said , @entity1			2
@entity1 was intrigued that the founder of the newspaper , @entity216 , also founded a religion			2
@entity1 came to respect the @entity187 's sustained and fair coverage of @entity4 during his time in jail			1
to this day , @entity1 's weaknesses , his turbulent youth and his sometimes tempestuous relationships with women can still detract from the iconic status that @entity1 achieved in his own lifetime			1
but , the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized @entity1 and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime			1
it augmented @entity1 's greatness			1
carrying on the work of @entity1 it is @entity1 's achievement as a universal icon that has always fascinated me most			1
he first conquered his jailers by convincing them that they were the ones imprisoned by their own unsustainable policies based on fear and racial injustice			0
and then he negotiated them out of power with the sheer force of his moral authority and belief in himself			0
@entity1 's example and actions in becoming the country 's first black president struck a mortal blow to racism worldwide and helped build confidence and pave the way for @entity262 to pull off a similar feat in the @entity194			1
if @entity1 has a global heir in the ongoing campaign against racism and the quest for human dignity it has to be @entity262			2
the power of @entity1 's leadership was rooted in the fact that at key moments in his life he acted independently of the movement to which he dedicated his life and to which he deferred as a " loyal and obedient " member			1
he did so when he decided in 1986 to begin negotiating with his jailers from behind bars not knowing where it would end			0
he did so in continuing to refer to former president @entity283 as a " man of integrity " long after it was less popular to do so in the ranks of the @entity179			0
and he did so again when he went out on a limb within his own constituency after his release to support the overwhelmingly white @entity4 rugby team in the @entity292 in 1995			2
@entity1 said that even if he wanted to he could not bind future generations to remember history in a particular way			2
the lesson of @entity1 's life is that he has no need to bind anyone to his legacy nor does he need any organization to do so			1
his actions in his own lifetime are his legacy and they will remain indelibly etched in history for generations to come as a living example to inspire the leaders of tomorrow			0
