-- a 56 - year - old married woman has won half of the second - largest @entity6 jackpot in @entity8 history and has taken the cash option , which after taxes , will be about $ 120 million , @entity2 president @entity1 said wednesday			1
@entity11 , of @entity12 , came to the lottery office with the winning ticket of hand - picked numbers , a mix of family birthdays and the lucky number 7			1
she did not appear at the afternoon lottery announcement in @entity21			0
@entity11 bought the ticket at the end of the day friday and it was a last - minute decision , @entity1 said			2
@entity1 gave a few details about @entity11 , saying she is married and had her daughter check online for the winning numbers after a radio announcer mentioned 7 was the mega ball number			1
two tickets matched the winning numbers in tuesday night 's $ 648 million jackpot			1
@entity11 's half of the cash option comes to $ 173,819,742.50 , before federal taxes ( 25 % ) and @entity36 taxes ( 6 % ) , officials said			1
according to @entity0 's calculation , the payout will net her $ 119,935,622.32			1
it will take one to two weeks before @entity11 will get her check , @entity1 said			2
@entity11 bought her winning ticket in @entity21 at a @entity44 in the lobby of an office building near the city 's @entity48 community ; the other ticket was sold in @entity51 , @entity52 , lottery officials said			1
" ( @entity11 ) had the radio on , and the announcer was talking about the @entity6 ball , which was seven , " @entity1 said			2
so @entity11 called her daughter and " between tears of joys and laughter , " the daughter relayed to her mother that she 'd won , the lottery president said			2
@entity11 told @entity1 , " i was in a state if disbelief			0
i still did n't believe it when my daughter told me , " @entity1 said			0

the winning numbers were 8 , 14 , 17 , 20 and 39 , with a @entity6 ball of 7			1
twenty ticket holders will win $ 1 million after matching all the numbers except the @entity6 ball			1
strong sales boosted the jackpot to $ 648 million from previous estimates of $ 636 million and $ 586 million , lottery officials said			1
that 's tantalizingly close to the @entity8 record -- a $ 656 million @entity6 jackpot split by three winning tickets in march 2012			1
this jackpot was so large in part because @entity6 became tougher to win			0
the prize rises with each miss , and no one had won it since organizers increased the pool of numbers to choose from -- making astronomical odds even longer -- in october			0
the @entity52 winning ticket was sold at @entity99 in a @entity51 strip mall , lottery officials said			2
you won the big one			0
now what ? the chance of winning -- never particularly bright -- got worse in late october , when @entity6 increased the drawing 's pool of numbers			0
the odds of hitting the jackpot , which were 1 in 176 million , are now 1 in 259 million			2
you have more than 1,000 times better chance of an asteroid or comet killing you -- and that 's using the longest estimated odds for the celestial bodies -- according to @entity116			0
" winning the @entity6 is akin to getting struck by lightning at the same time you 're being eaten by a shark , " said @entity117 , founder of @entity118			0
$ 800 million in lottery prizes unclaimed previously , lottery players chose five numbers , ranging from 1 to 56			1
it 's now 1 to 75			0
but the sixth , gold ball has fewer numbers from which to choose , as the pool decreased from 46 to 15			0
