-- on wednesday night , i hosted a town hall - style debate on guns in @entity5 , talking to lawmakers , mass shooting survivors , lawyers , gun lobbyists -- anyone , basically , who has a strong opinion about what i consider to be the single biggest issue facing @entity5 today			1
since i joined @entity0 two years ago , there have been a series of gun - related tragedies , including the attack on @entity5 rep. @entity19 and the @entity20 , @entity21 , movie theater massacre			1
each sparked a short - term debate about guns			2
yet each debate fizzled out with zero action being taken to try and curb the use of deadly weapons on the streets of @entity5			1
now , following the grotesque slaughter of 20 innocent young children at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , i sense that the mood has changed			0
we have reached a crucial moment in this debate , and i intend to use my platform to continue this conversation on wednesday night and going forward			0
the media have previously been quick to move on to other stories after these tragic acts of gun violence			0
opinion : do n't let this moment pass without acting on gun control i 've made my own views clear on my show -- the senseless killing has to stop			2
high - powered assault rifles of the type used at @entity20 and @entity34 belong in the military and police , not in civilian hands			0
high - capacity magazines , too , should be banned			0
and background checks on anyone buying guns in @entity5 should be comprehensive and stringently enforced			1
as president @entity62 said , doing nothing is no longer an option			0
but , at the same time , law - abiding @entity5 who want to protect themselves under the @entity65 right to bear arms must be respected			1
as should the rights of @entity5 to use guns for hunting and sport			1
this is a vital debate for the country			0
some 12,000 people are murdered in the @entity5 with guns every year , compared with just 35 in @entity75 , where there are strong gun laws			1
analysis : guns and the law @entity33 should , and must , be a tipping point for real action to bring this number down			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity86			2
