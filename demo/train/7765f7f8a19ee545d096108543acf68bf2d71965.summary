-- " no one 's ever asked to see my birth certificate			1
they know that this is the place that i was born and raised			0
" with that comment to a crowd in @entity8 , @entity10 presidential nominee @entity9 officially embraced the " birther " movement and touched off a firestorm of protest across the airwaves and internet			2
of course , those protesting did n't include his live audience or the extremists on the right			0
nor , given @entity9 's embrace of @entity22 , should we be surprised by this joke - that 's - not - a - joke			1
@entity26 of @entity27 put it succinctly : " jokes can be more revealing than talking points			0
" but what , exactly , did @entity9 reveal with this pre-meditated " offhand " remark ? that he 's courting the radical right ? he already chose @entity34 as his vice-presidential nominee			2
that he 's pandering to the right - wing noise machine and the corporate special interest propaganda machine ? we already know that because he appears on media friendly to the right but limits the number and kind of questions reporters can ask him , and then responds with dodging answers			2
opinion : election a stark choice on @entity50 's future that he 's following the @entity55 - @entity54 " keep it vague , keep them afraid " playbook ? commentators and analysts have been pointing this out since @entity9 entered the campaign			1
@entity9 -- hiding behind the plausible deniability that it was just a joke , with a wink and a nod to the extremists in his base -- tried to divert attention from the @entity68 's haunting his campaign : @entity70 , @entity71 , " corporations are people			1
" his comment has the added benefit of satisfying his most fervent supporters and those anonymous supporters bankrolling one of the most misleading advertising campaigns , a blitzkrieg that strikes just the right partisan undertones			0
the real story is that there 's nothing unusual about the remark			0
it 's no more in the gutter than a lot of things that have been said about president @entity90 since coming into office			1
it 's just one more insinuation designed to distract us from the most disconcerting weaknesses of @entity9 's candidacy -- that he fails to offer details about his policy proposals and stubbornly refuses to disclose more than two years of tax returns			1
but it is sad and revealing , nevertheless			0
it is sad that a campaign stretch that began with his asking @entity90 to stop apologizing for @entity50 ( something fact checkers noted the president never did ) and roundly debunked welfare attack ad ended with a xenophobic and roundly debunked birther reference			1
and it reveals not just moral turpitude , but moral vacuity			0
his birth certificate dog - whistles are not just desperate , they are deliberate			1
@entity9 is campaigning as if he feels he is entitled to the @entity112 -- that , like a feudal lord or @entity115 aristocrat , he does not have to answer questions , he does not have to be forthright , he does not have to be honest			1
it also reveals , as so much before it has done , that he believes the @entity50 people are too ignorant , too indifferent , too lazy , too afraid to bother and that we can be fooled			0
he also knows that the @entity50 press will , after huffing and puffing , give him a free pass on this one , too			0
how we respond to @entity9 's remark will reveal a lot about us , as well			1
will we get what he 's doing ? will we reject the noxious condescension and the patronizing ? will we demand an open and honest accounting of his business dealings ? if he wants to be in charge of our business , we should see how he 's run his			0
@entity133 could hinder @entity10 chance to define @entity9 at convention the media , too , will reveal a lot about itself by its response			2
outrage , shock , tongue - clicking - these are superficial and useless			0
allowing @entity9 to backpedal -- " it 's only a joke " -- misses the point			1
the media needs to press for policy specifics and contrast claims with facts			0
as i said , we should n't be surprised by @entity9 's remark			1
trying to pretend that somehow @entity90 is not an @entity50 - born leader , or questioning his patrioism , or his values by using the @entity155 often speaks in code			2
but let 's decode some of the implications : -- show us your birth certificate , but i wo n't show you my tax returns			1
-- you need to prove your identity to vote , but my super pac allies do n't need to identify their donors			0
-- i 'll lie about @entity90 's plans , but wo n't explain my own			1
-- i 'll blame @entity90 for the problems he did n't cause , and take credit for his solutions that work			2
@entity9 's birther remark was less a surprise than a confirmation that his moral compass is off center			1
mr. @entity9 , @entity50 's not an aristocracy			2
it 's not where you were born -- in a cabin or a mansion -- or how you were raised -- in poverty by a single parent or with money and privilege -- that matters			0
it matters where you go and what you do			0
it 's who you help , what you 're willing to sacrifice , and how honest you are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : @entity9 's birth certificate " joke " was n't *innocuous*
she says it 's part of a campaign that uses coded *messages* to *devalue* the president
@entity195 : @entity9 *wrongly* accused @entity90 of weakening welfare reform
she says @entity9 is seeking to distract attention from questions he wo n't answer
