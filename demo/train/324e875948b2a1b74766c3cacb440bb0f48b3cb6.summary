-- @entity1 officially entered the @entity3 election race on tuesday , saying she had secured the backing of 500 elected officials required to stand in the @entity3 presidential contest			1
@entity8 , the leader of @entity3 's far - right @entity10 may share some of her famous father 's politics , but that is where the similarity ends			1
while @entity17 , who founded the @entity10 and led the party from 1972 until last year , was full of bombast and fury , his 43 - year - old daughter measures her words - especially on the sensitive issue of immigration -- and knows the value of a smile			1
the former lawyer and her supporters believe these qualities can propel her into at least a second place finish in the first round of the @entity3 presidential elections on april 22 -- despite opinion polls indicating otherwise			1
and while the party 's presidential candidate may be more telegenic than her father , @entity8 herself believes the @entity10 's appeal has widened too because voters are different			1
" i think the structure of our electorate has changed , " she said			0
" the perception that right - wing voters have of me is extremely different today from the perception voters of the right had of @entity17			2
" in fact @entity8 , a twice - divorced mother - of - three , says her voters these days often come from both the political right and left , although this claim is not borne out by public opinion polls			1
it is true though that her political program does cut across party lines , especially her arguments against both illegal and legal immigration , and the political integration of @entity57 and the euro			0
" our political leaders have a fascination for the @entity62 and they want absolutely to create a @entity62 of @entity57 , " she said			0
" we have seen the result : @entity57 has never been so weak economically as today			0
our leaders ' craziness for the euro creates a risk for the entire world			0
" @entity8 goes into the election with anti-euro , protectionist policies for @entity3 , and opposes the privatization of the country 's post office , which she says will hit rural areas hard			1
she has also worked to remove extremist elements from her party			0
but her critics -- and there are many -- say @entity8 remains a risk			2
when she is away from her supporters and out in the public she often gets booed -- and worse			0
she was doused with water when she visited the @entity87 island of @entity88 , a @entity3 overseas territory whose citizens come from a racially mixed background where many view the extreme right as the real threat			2
one protester in @entity88 said : " as a country of human rights @entity3 can not accept this kind of person who takes advantage of the economic crisis to spread a message of @entity103 and xenophobia			2
" so far , @entity8 has not faced the same accusations of racism that her father faced during his time as @entity10 leader , and she shrugs off this criticism : " i have lots of experiences with this sort of thing ... they bark but they do n't bite			1
" she has personal experience with political opponents who deploy more than words though			0
when she was eight years old a bomb intended for her father exploded near her family 's apartment , but she , her two sisters and her parents escaped unharmed			0
@entity8 overcame a major hurdle by securing the required backing of the 500 elected officials required to be a candidate in the presidential race			1
some analysts had speculated she would fail to obtain the necessary signatories because many would be loathe to be associated with the far right			0
now @entity8 , and her political views , may prove a real wild card in the election , perhaps even threatening one of the two top contenders , conservative president @entity143 and @entity145 rival @entity144			1
this would mirror the most notable achievement of her father , who shocked @entity3 in 2002 by coming in second , ahead of socialist prime minister @entity150 in the first round of voting in the presidential election .			2

@entity1 says she has backing of 500 elected officials needed to stand in @entity3 election

her supporters believe her qualities can propel her into at least second place finish in election
