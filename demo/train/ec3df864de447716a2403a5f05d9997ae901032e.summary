-- @entity2 's controversial 75 % tax for high earners drove award - winning actor @entity4 to take @entity6 citizenship			1
now , @entity2 football clubs are going on strike to protest the legislation 's planned implementation next year , claiming it will make them less competitive against @entity13 rivals and cause further financial hardship			1
the @entity15 of @entity16 ( @entity17 ) announced thursday that they will boycott all matches in the top two divisions scheduled between november 29 - december 2			1
it will be the first such strike in @entity2 since 1972 , when players protested about their salaries , and will be the first in a major @entity13 league since the start of the 2010 - 11 @entity27 season was disrupted			2
" this unprecedented day must be the occasion for the silent majority of @entity2 football to express its opposition , " @entity17 president @entity28 said in a statement thursday			1
the 75 % tax will apply to players who earn more than € 1 million ( $ 1.38 million ) a year			1
under the law 's initial wording the earners themselves would have had to pay it , but after protests @entity43 's @entity42 government moved the responsibility to their employers			0
however , the @entity17 claims this is unfair as its clubs are losing money anyway -- racking up a combined deficit of € 108 million ( $ 149 million ) at the end of the 2011 - 12 season			2
their total debt for the last three season amounts to € 303 million ( $ 418 million )			0
" this tax , unfair and discriminatory , is estimated by the professional football industry at € 44m ( $ 60m ) per year , " the @entity17 said			0
" the economic crisis has not spared these clubs , who have seen their income from ticketing and tv rights decreased for the last three years in a row			0
" the @entity17 claims the tax will make @entity2 clubs less competitive against @entity13 rivals in countries which have lower taxes			1
" in a context of a deregulated @entity13 competition where players have the ability to go and play everywhere they want , the @entity2 clubs -- if they want to stay competitive -- can not massively decrease their remunerations , " it said			2
" for similar salaries , a player in @entity2 is costing the clubs 33 % more than a player would in @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 or @entity27			2
" the @entity17 , which says it pays € 130 million ( $ 179.5 million ) to amateur sports each year as an act of " solidarity , " claims the tax will cost jobs in the @entity2 football industry -- which employs 25,000 people			1
' we wish to open all the stadiums to all the fans , football lovers , those people who make @entity2 football on a daily basis , " @entity28 said of the strike			1
" the supporters , amateur players , associations , volunteers , coaches , agents and employees			0
all of those who will suffer from the consequences of this unfair tax			0
the social role of football will be impacted by the consequences of this measure			0
" the tax will hit clubs to varying degrees			0
big - spending champion @entity112 , which has invested more than € 200 million ( $ 276 million ) in players since being bought by a @entity116 consortium in 2011 , may have to pay just under half the clubs ' € 44 million bill according to reports estimating its salary bills			0
@entity122 , backed by a @entity6 billionaire , would next season be exempt as it does not fall under @entity2 tax laws -- and the principality club says it will fight the league 's plans to change its status in future .			2
