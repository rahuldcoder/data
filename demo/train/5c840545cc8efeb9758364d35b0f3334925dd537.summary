@entity44 's novella , " @entity43 " inspired @entity3 's obsession with game fish and moved him to depict the famous fishing story in a series of pen and ink drawings a quarter of a century ago			1
he paints every day and 10 percent of the proceeds of all the paintings he sells goes straight back into his eco-organizations			0
@entity3 also created a tv series , " @entity58 , " to showcase game fish and their importance to the environment			2
" to see them underwater in their glowing , feeding and moving colors , their aggression colors are probably one of the most exciting things you can do as a diver , " @entity3 said			2

" @entity126 are just stinking fish to most people			0
