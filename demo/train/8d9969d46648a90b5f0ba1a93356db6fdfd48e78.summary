@entity0 -- when @entity3 was introduced thursday as @entity0 police commissioner , the 66 - year - old law enforcement veteran held up a children 's book with the title , " your police			1
" " we must always remember that whenever you see a policeman , he is your friend , " said @entity3 , reading a passage from a book he first checked out of the library 56 years ago			2
but @entity3 , who served as police commissioner in the 1990s , will take the helm of the nation 's largest department not only at a time of low crime rates , but also heightened tension with the public over his predecessor 's controversial stop - and - frisk policy that critics say targeted minorities			1
mayor - elect @entity29 said the appointment reflected his goal of protecting @entity0 while simultaneously respecting their civil liberties -- echoing one theme of a mayoral campaign that was heavily critical of stop - and - frisk			1
" he is going to bring police and community back together , " de @entity29 said thursday			2
@entity40 praised his new commissioner as " the leading voice " on community policing and said he had " absolute confidence , 100 % confidence " that @entity3 would complete the double goals of keeping down crime and improving strained relations with the community			1
" in the last few years in this city we have seen an approach that has too often alienated communities , has too often led to a divide between police and community in some of our neighborhoods , " said @entity29			1
the stop - and - frisk policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they deem suspicious , even if they 've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time			2
opponents have challenged the practice as racist and illegal			0
law enforcement and other proponents say the practice helps reduce crime			0
in august , a federal judge in @entity0 ordered that stop - and - frisk be altered , finding it unconstitutional in part because it unlawfully targets blacks and @entity76			2
the judge ordered the appointment of a monitor to develop changes in the policy as well as other reforms			0
a federal appeals court later blocked the ruling that deemed stop - and - frisk unconstitutional and removed the judge from the case as other appeals are heard			0
but @entity29 has said that his administration will drop the appeal			2
the rev. @entity90 , one of the most vocal critics of stop - and - frisk , said he hoped the new mayor and police commissioner work with a broader cross section of the city			2
" when @entity3 served in @entity0 under @entity98 , we had a very distant and adversarial relationship , but when he served in @entity100 , he and i ... worked closely on gang violence and police misconduct matters , " @entity90 said			1
" mr. @entity3 knows of my concerns and the concerns of others about racial profiling in stop - and - frisk policing but at the same time is aware of our desire to continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community			1
" @entity113 , an expert who has written numerous books about the nation 's police departments , said @entity3 practiced an aggressive form of policing -- including stop - and - frisk -- as commissioner under former mayor @entity98			1
" the wild card here is we do n't know what 's going to happen with this federal suit , " said @entity113 , referring to the august ruling			0
" are there going to be monitors ? is the police commissioner ultimately going to be responsible to a federal judge ? traditionally , the police department works best when it has a strong commissioner running it			0
but if there are people over him who can veto his orders , it wo n't work so well			0
" @entity138 reflects @entity3 is credited with pioneering the @entity140 's @entity139 , a command and accountability system that employed real - time intelligence , rapid deployment of resources and accountability systems in police work			1

he also was praised for improving the @entity161 's relationships with the city 's many diverse communities			0
