-- @entity2 's poor start to the season continued with a lackluster 1 - 1 draw against @entity5 , leaving new coach @entity6 still seeking a first league win for his new club			1
@entity2 's injury problems meant that @entity6 again had to shuffle the pack and draft 20 year old @entity11 into his defense			1
unsurprisingly given the changes , @entity5 started the brighter of the two and it was against the run of play when @entity2 took the lead			1
some good work by @entity19 , who had been restored to the starting line up , released @entity22 international @entity21 who fired home from close range			0
but rather than build on the goal , @entity2 let @entity5 back into the game			1
@entity28 's big summer signing @entity29 , once considered one of @entity32 's brightest prospects , scored his first goal for the club to secure a point that left @entity6 still waiting for his first league win as @entity2 coach			1
" in the first half we played an equal match with @entity5			1
we did n't create so much but scored a fantastic goal , " @entity6 said after the game			2
" football is played for creating chances and making goals			0
we have n't created so many chances today , " he added			0
" we probably had more ball possession and were more dominant than the last match but you have to win your game at that moment and we could n't , so that 's a pity			2
" @entity53 to arrive ? as the transfer window draws to a close on september 1st , @entity2 will likely add to their squad with @entity59 's @entity58 international @entity57 heavily rumored to be joining for what may be a @entity62 transfer record			2
leading @entity22 newspaper @entity63 reported sunday that the two clubs had agreed a fee of 75 million euros ( $ 99 million ) for @entity53			0
" i can not say anything about transfers , you have to understand that , " @entity6 said			2
" now you have to wait and see			0
when the moment is there @entity2 shall announce it ... it is not only @entity53 , maybe ( @entity75 ) @entity74 or ( @entity76 ) @entity76 ! " he added , half jokingly			2
according to reports from @entity22 , @entity53 has already said goodbye to his teammates			0
" he has come and has not practiced			0
it 's not official yet , but he came to say goodbye , " said @entity59 coach @entity79 , according to the @entity80			0
" we gave thanks for what he has done for this club and wish him luck for the future			0
it is not official , but it is solved			0
" unhappy @entity91 return meanwhile , @entity92 hosted @entity93 and welcomed back former coach @entity91			1
@entity91 , who enjoyed a successful spell in charge at @entity96 , masterminded @entity93 's return to the @entity98 but could do little to stop his old club run away comfortable 4 - 0 winners			1
@entity101 scored twice , whilst @entity102 and @entity103 completed the scoring			0
in sunday 's other game , @entity105 continued their fine start to the season with a 1 - 1 home draw against @entity110			1
@entity105 were reduced to 10 men early in the first half but still had the best of the play and managed to take the lead through @entity117 international @entity116 before half time			2
@entity105 held on for most of the second half but conceded a late , undeserved equalizer when @entity120 bundled the ball home from close range .			1

@entity2 held 1 - 1 by @entity5
*utd* still without a league win under @entity6
@entity92 beat @entity93 4 - 0
@entity105 hold on for a draw against @entity110
