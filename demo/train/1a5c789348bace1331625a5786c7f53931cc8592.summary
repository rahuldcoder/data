-- for half a century , the world has applauded @entity2 as a heart - stirring @entity4 hero			1
he lifted the nation 's spirits when , as one of the original @entity10 7 astronauts , he was blasted alone into orbit around the @entity12 ; the enduring affection for him is so powerful that even now people find themselves misting up at the sight of his face or the sound of his voice			1
but for all these years , @entity2 has had a hero of his own , someone who he has seen display endless courage of a different kind : @entity24			1
they have been married for 68 years			2
he is 90 ; she turned 92 on friday			2
this weekend there has been news coverage of the 50th anniversary of @entity2 's flight into orbit			1
we are being reminded that , half a century down the line , he remains @entity4 's unforgettable hero			1
he has never really bought that			2
because the heroism he most cherishes is of a sort that is seldom cheered			2
it belongs to the person he has known longer than he has known anyone else in the world			2
@entity2 and @entity24 first knew each other when -- literally -- they shared a playpen			1
in @entity49 , @entity50 , his parents and hers were friends			2
when the families got together , their children played			2
@entity2 -- the future @entity53 fighter pilot , the future test - pilot ace , the future astronaut -- was pure gold from the start			1
he would end up having what it took to rise to the absolute pinnacle of @entity4 regard during the space race ; imagine what it meant to be the young @entity2 in the small confines of @entity49			1
three - sport varsity athlete , most admired boy in town , mr. everything			0
@entity24 was bright , was caring , was talented , was generous of spirit			1
but she could talk only with the most excruciating of difficulty			0
her stuttering was so severe that it was categorized as an " 85 % " disability -- 85 % of the time , she could not manage to make words come out			2
when she tried to recite a poem in elementary school , she was laughed at			0
she was not able to speak on the telephone			0
she could not have a regular conversation with a friend			0
even as a boy he was wise enough to understand that people who could not see past her stutter were missing out on knowing a rare and wonderful girl			0
they married on april 6 , 1943			0
as a military wife , she found that life as she and @entity2 moved around the country could be quite hurtful			1
she has written : " i can remember some very painful experiences -- especially the ridicule			0
" in department stores , she would wander unfamiliar aisles trying to find the right section , embarrassed to attempt to ask the salesclerks for help			0
in taxis , she would have to write requests to the driver , because she could n't speak the destination out loud			0
in restaurants , she would point to the items on the menu			0
a fine musician , @entity107 , in every community where she and @entity2 moved , would play the organ in church as a way to make new friends			1
she and @entity2 had two children ; she has written : " can you imagine living in the modern world and being afraid to use the telephone ? ' hello ' used to be so hard for me to say			1
i worried that my children would be injured and need a doctor			0
could i somehow find the words to get the information across on the phone ? " @entity2 , as a @entity53 aviator , flew 59 combat missions in @entity123 and 90 during the @entity124			1
every time he was deployed , he and @entity107 said goodbye the same way			1
his last words to her before leaving were : " i 'm just going down to the corner store to get a pack of gum			0
" and , with just the two of them there , she was able to always reply : " do n't be long			0
" on that february day in 1962 when the world held its breath and the @entity140 rocket was about to propel him toward space , those were their words , once again			0
and in 1998 , when , at 77 , he went back to space aboard the @entity147 , it was an understandably tense time for them			0
what if something happened to end their life together ? she knew what he would say to her before boarding the shuttle			2
he did -- and this time he gave her a present to hold onto : a pack of gum			0
she carried it in a pocket next to her heart until he was safely home			0
many times in her life she attempted various treatments to cure her stutter			2
but in 1973 , she found a doctor in @entity172 who ran an intensive program she and @entity2 hoped would help her			1
she traveled there to enroll and to give it her best effort			0
the miracle she and @entity2 had always waited for at last , as miracles will do , arrived			1
at age 53 , she was able to talk fluidly , and not in brief , anxiety - ridden , agonizing bursts			0
@entity2 has said that on the first day he heard her speak to him with confidence and clarity , he dropped to his knees to offer a prayer of gratitude			1
he has written : " i saw @entity107 's perseverance and strength through the years and it just made me admire her and love her even more			1
" he has heard roaring ovations in countries around the globe for his own valor , but his awe is reserved for @entity107 , and what she accomplished : " i do n't know if i would have had the courage			1
" her voice is so clear and steady now that she regularly gives public talks			0
if you are lucky enough to know the @entity198 , the sight and sound of them bantering and joking with each other and playfully finishing each others ' sentences is something that warms you and makes you thankful just to be in the same room			0
monday will be the anniversary of the @entity10 space shot , and once again people will remember , and will speak of the heroism of @entity2 the astronaut			1
but if you ever find yourself at an event where the @entity214 are appearing , and you want to see someone so brimming with pride and love that you may feel your own tears start to well up , wait until the moment that @entity107 stands to say a few words to the audience			1
and as she begins , take a look at her husband 's eyes			1
follow @entity223 on @entity224 join the conversation on @entity226 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2
