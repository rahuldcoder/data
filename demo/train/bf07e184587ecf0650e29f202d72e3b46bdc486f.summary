@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 says the government evicted her from her home in the @entity1 capital and trucked her and others out to a town an hour away where she now lives in a hot green metal shed with no running water and dim prospects			1
many @entity1 aids patients and their families have been relocated to this community outside @entity17			1
before the move , she had a job as a dishwasher , but now the 36 - year - old woman is unemployed , penniless and her health has taken a turn for the worse			2
she has @entity25 like many of the others in the 40 @entity25 - affected families that were resettled here			1
" we were called for a meeting and when i got there , a lot of trucks were already prepared			2
they told us to prepare our stuff for moving out , " she said , her voice trembling as she detailed her departure from the @entity43 shantytown she called home for nine years			1
" everybody cried the day we left			2
" as @entity1 emerges from the 1970s @entity47 genocide and decades of conflict , evictions for development purposes have become a hot issue , with rights groups and upset villagers living on desirable land launching protests in recent years			0
but what sets the families apart at @entity17 is that they have @entity25			1
" the problems that this community face are not unlike problems that people face throughout the country , " said @entity58 , an independent consultant focusing on @entity25 and land issues			1
" what has made these problems extreme is that they have been isolated and treated as a community " and their relocation has added " additional problems , like real health risks of many immune compromised people living far too close together			1
this place would be a health risk to healthy people			1
" this is the second relocation for many of these families			0
they had been living in a shantytown in the @entity1 capital , an area called @entity85 that was across the street from a hospital where they received medical care and where they could find jobs to earn $ 1.25 or $ 1.50 a day			1
@entity58 said they had lived dispersed throughout the community but were forced to move into one building there in 2007 when the area started to undergo development			0
" they were segregated into a green building , which very quickly became known as the ... @entity25 village , " @entity58 said			1
" this @entity25 colony in @entity17 is the second time they are being even further isolated ... it 's been an extremely traumatic situation for them			1
" @entity58 said most of the families that were moved to @entity108 told her they have lost their jobs , their health is worsening due to a lack of clean water and food , and they face discrimination from their new neighbors because of their illness			1
" we feel very ashamed to go outside , they look like they [ are ] discriminating against us , " @entity3 said			0
@entity43 deputy governor @entity121 said those who were relocated got a plot of land , a house and $ 275			2
he also noted they were provided rice , electricity and said , " when the water supply can be connected to this area , then we can connect it for these people			1
" @entity121 said the people were illegally squatting in the @entity43 shantytown , but they were not forcefully evicted			1
" they proposed to go ... because living in that area ( their previous shantytown ) they had floods and they have no proper business to do in there , so that 's why they proposed to us to go there , " he said			2
" they think that when they go there ( to @entity108 ) , they can own the land , they can own a house and they can make some business or something like that			0
" he also said he did not believe there was discrimination in the area , " but there is some feeling when they ( people ) learn that someone has been living with @entity25			1
" @entity3 said her new home has brought many challenges and a recent blood test showed that her @entity169 count -- a marker of decreased immune function that is often used to demonstrate how well anti-hiv drugs are working , according to the @entity173 -- had gone down			0
she said the doctor told her she needed to eat more , but she said having little money means eating less : " it means that my health is getting worse , " she said			2
the water in their new home is from a well and is undrinkable unless it is boiled or purified			2
" we are patients , we need some clean water , " she said			1
" they said the water can not be drunk , just for using to wash clothes and things like that			2
" another man , @entity190 , takes the temperature inside his green shed at noon every day			0
on average , it is 35 degrees @entity195 ( 95 degrees @entity194 ) but one time spiked up to @entity195 ( 122 )			0
" this area is very difficult , " he said			0
" i am always sick , and i always have a headache			2
the weather is so hot even my son has gone to the clinic two times already			0
" home care specialist , @entity204 , has been working with this community since 1998 and holds a clinic at @entity17 once a week			1
he said the move " has strongly affected them			0
" " this is a long - term effect , not a short - term one , because medicine alone can not help them			0
it combines with other factors like food , eating enough , sleeping enough and a good environment , so all this can help make their health stable , " he said			0
" the problem is right now that what these people are facing is about their food , about their sleep and about the heat			2
sometimes this affects the quality of the medicine they keep			0
" @entity190 said his son , who is in first grade , heard that parents of local children told them not to play with him because he has @entity25			1
" he just told me that he wanted to play with those children but when they saw him they just run away , " he said			0
" i know right now some parents they just learning and understand about us , and they start to tolerate , but some others keep us in isolation -- like they still look at us , treating us very bad by not coming very close and not making friends with us			0
" @entity204 said he was providing health care to the villagers as a way to bring them closer to the group , and they have held meetings with them about how @entity25 is contracted			1
" there was very little thought given to integrating the community into the larger resettlement area of @entity108 , " said @entity248 , the @entity249 country coordinator for @entity1			0
" by basically settling the community in one contiguous place it opens the community up to discrimination			0
" the @entity264 team in @entity1 also " was disappointed that the relocation was carried out before the site was made habitable " and monitors would visit the site in late august , @entity248 said			0
@entity265 , secretary - general of the @entity1 government 's @entity266 , said the @entity245 's worries were about the housing , not their health care , since he said they still had good access to treatment , including home - based care , medicine and the help of charities			2
he said the housing situation could not be changed overnight , but it would improve " step by step , " and he also noted @entity108 was an area the municipality wants to develop			0
" the municipality has a plan for the future , " he said			0
" i asked the government to explain to them ( the @entity17 residents ) , to provide more information to them			1
" he also noted there was " no serious discrimination " in @entity1 against people with hiv / aids , but that the @entity25 authority would try to ensure any such problems did not arise in the future			1
back at @entity17 , people think of the future and how they will make ends meet			1
one man in the community who has @entity25 lost one job in the move but still has part - time work			1
he said things have improved with their new neighbors			0
" when we first arrived here , the villagers around the area just said look at @entity25 people living here and so they did not allow their children or relatives to come and play in this area and they do n't talk to us			1
but now after seeing the home care specialist , " things seem to be getting better with them , he said			0
still , he and his friends from the old shantytown are not happy with their new lives			2
" we are living with disappointment , " he said .			0
