-- the cell - phone video shows a scene straight out of hell : a darkness lit only by billowing smoke , tinted orange and red from nearby flames , as a vehicle hurtles toward safety			1
" @entity13 ? " says a small , tearful voice , tinged with panic			1
" we 're going to make it , " @entity14 tells his child			2
" we 're going to be fine			2
" " where 's @entity20 ? " the child says , then , urgently , " why is she stopping ? " @entity22 , 13 , shot the video in the car with his father as his family , in two cars , fled a deadly @entity29 wildfire that crept too close to their home earlier this week			1
firefighters were hoping to make more progress thursday on containing the fire , which has burned more than 4,000 acres in a mountainous area near @entity36			2
with improving conditions , some evacuated residents were allowed to return to their homes thursday morning , the @entity38 sheriff 's office said			1
the @entity42 apologized for the wildfire after it was revealed that it was caused by a " controlled " burn that got out of control , killing at least two people			1
" this is heartbreaking and we 're sorry , " @entity47 told reporters wednesday about the @entity49 , which has scorched 4,140 acres in @entity38 , destroying or damaging 27 houses and leaving a woman missing in addition to the two fatalities			2
the revelation pushed gov. @entity57 to suspend such burns			2
a team is being formed to investigate how last thursday 's controlled burn re-erupted on monday as a wildfire			1
" the loss of life and property this week is devastating and this fire is far from being contained , " he said in a news release			2
" that 's why our top priority remains working to control the blaze , " @entity57 said			2
he suspended the use of prescribed burns by state agencies on state lands -- including state parks , refuges , @entity79 lands and any agency that manages lands -- or under contract on nonstate lands , such as by the @entity84			0
the suspension will be effective until the review of protocols and procedures of prescribed burning is complete			0
@entity14 told @entity0 on thursday as the family loaded the cars , " the last thing i saw was this large flame shot up , and we realized we had to go right then			1
" " we turned that corner and went from daylight into pure darkness , " he said			0
@entity14 's wife , @entity98 , was in the vehicle in front of her husband			1
she explained thursday she put the brakes on -- prompting her child 's panic -- because she was fumbling for the headlights in the darkness , and because she hesitated , wondering if the family was going to make it out or whether she and @entity14 should turn around			1
but then , she said , their neighbor went " flying " past them , and she decided to keep going			0
" there it is , right there , " @entity14 tells the children on the video as they pass flames			1
" oh , my gosh ! " a child exclaims , and @entity14 soothes them as the sky brightens , " we 're out			0
" @entity22 said his father handed him the phone and " i just did my best to capture the whole experience			0
" @entity98 said their home was still standing as of tuesday , when they saw an aerial shot of its roof line and that of their neighbor			0
she said she has received word that firefighters are camping out on her driveway and her neighbor 's , putting out spot fires			1
their home is not out of danger yet , she said , but the family is " still hoping for the best			1
" and as firefighters work to extinguish the blaze , the search continues for a woman missing since the fast - moving wildfire swept through her home			1
a search and rescue team of 32 people and six dogs searched 60 acres wednesday around her house and found no sign of the woman , said @entity150 , a public information officer with the @entity151			0
firefighters have dropped 4,100 gallons of fire retardant on the blaze , which was fueled by high winds and dry conditions , officials said			0
@entity38 coroner @entity158 identified the two victims as a married couple , @entity160 , 77 , and @entity161 , 76			0
" they were found very close together , " @entity150 said			0
" one was found outside ; one was found inside			0
" officials were trying to determine why the couple did not leave the fire zone by monday night			0
@entity0 's @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity172 contributed to this report .			0
