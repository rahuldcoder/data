-- the lone , tattered page from a decimated children 's book sat quietly amid the rest of the rubble			1
but the words spoke volumes about the pain and nostalgia in the city of @entity11 : " i remember my old house , its rooms so bright and wide			1
its halls will echo for all time , with the laughter heard inside			2
" @entity19 found the battered page while volunteering with @entity21			2
" it more than likely came from a house that had been demolished , " said fellow volunteer @entity22 , who was with @entity19 at the time			1
" then i thought about how many houses were full of laughter and memories			2
" at least 12,000 homes were damaged or demolished from monday 's abysmal tornado , @entity30 mayor @entity29 said			1
the twister killed 24 people , including 10 children , and injured 353 in central @entity30			1
with everyone missing now accounted for , the daunting road to recovery is underway			0
throngs of volunteers have come to @entity11 to help			0
each has a poignant tale about the breadth of the human condition			0
@entity45 started searching for survivors as soon as the storm passed			1
he documented the search on video			0
" is there anybody here ? ! " he bellowed as he walked past heaps of debris			0
in the distance , deep under a mound of shredded lumber , a man 's voice replied : " here ! " @entity45 and other volunteers raced to the wreckage			1
" we 're gon na get you out ! " @entity45 told the man			0
he later told @entity0 's @entity64 he was stunned at the discovery			1
basements scarce in tornado - prone area -- here 's why " the odds of me filming and capturing this man cry out for help is one ( in a ) million , and i 'm happy he is alive , " @entity45 said			1
demands for storm shelters of the 10 children killed by the tornado , seven were inside @entity77			1
the twister crushed the school and reduced it to pieces			0
@entity81 , 8 , was one of the victims			0
" i am angry to an extent			0
i know the schools did what they thought they could do but with us living in @entity30 , tornado shelters should be in every school , " @entity81 's mother , @entity84 , told @entity0 's @entity85			1
her daughter , who was also at @entity77 when the storm struck , survived			1
photos : the path of destruction from above " there should be a place that if this ever happened again during school that kids can get to a safe place , " @entity81 said			2
" that we do n't have to sit there and go through rubble ... and may not ever find what we 're looking for			2
" @entity11 mayor @entity107 said he would push for a law requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new homes			1
" what we will do is get the stakeholders here in the city ... and we 'll discuss what we think we need to have , " @entity107 said			0
" anybody that lives in any tornado area should have ( a storm shelter ) , but it 's just the matter of cost			1
" custom homebuilder @entity121 said an above - ground shelter runs $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 ; a small basement would cost $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 ; and a concrete cellar built during new - house construction would cost as little as $ 2,200			0
looking ahead on top of the human toll and grief , the cost of the tornado 's destruction is astronomical			1
insurance claims from the area are likely to exceed $ 2 billion , said @entity135 , a representative of the @entity136			2
but the @entity137 is in " good shape " to support the recovery in @entity30 and other disaster zones , such as @entity141 and @entity142 after @entity144 , @entity137 administrator @entity143 said			1
" we got full allocation last year with the @entity144 supplemental funds , " @entity143 said			0
" we are looking to continue the response here as well as the previous disasters			0
" but " if we have another hurricane , we may need more money			0
" as @entity11 continues its arduous recovery , @entity22 pondered the page from the children 's book			2
it shows a charming yellow house set atop lush green landscape			0
he said it does n't just allude to the joy now lost after the storm			2
" it reminds me of the laughter and memories yet to come in the new houses that will be built , " he said			0
" the memories are truly found in the heart , not the house			0
" @entity11 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why @entity0 's @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			2
