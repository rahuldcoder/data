-- from the political unrest in @entity3 to why @entity5 majority leader @entity4 cries , here are some of the best sound bites from the sunday morning talk shows : on @entity3 and president @entity9 's future : " this is going to be up to the @entity3 people			1
but let 's look at what we have			2
we have a calendar that already has elections for the next president scheduled , so there is an action - enforcing event that is already on the calendar			0
" -- secretary of state @entity22 , @entity0 's " @entity23 " " i think it is loud and clear from everybody in @entity3 that @entity9 has to leave today , and it is nonnegotiable for every @entity3			1
people have been saying or demonstrating for him to leave			1
today , the demonstrations say that he should be put to trial			2
if he wants to save his skin , if he has an iota of patriotism , i would advise him to leave today and save the country			1
" -- @entity3 opposition leader @entity37 , @entity0 's " @entity38 " " i firmly believe it			1
i think if you listen to the street , they are not asking for democracy , they are not asking for anything except the removal of @entity9			1
he 's become a symbol for everything that they find objectionable			2
it does n't mean it ca n't be a transition as orderly and i certainly hope it is			0
but he is a symbol now and you 've got to change the symbol			0
" -- @entity56 , former @entity57 ambassador to @entity3 , " @entity23 " " so i think what we need to do now is to lay out a plan for @entity9 to lift the state of emergency , announce that elections -- free and fair -- will be held in september , which were already planned , allow an open and free democratic process , which i think we could have some confidence if it was an open process that you would see a free and fair election and that we make sure that the aspirations of the @entity3 people are realized finally			1
" -- @entity71 sen. @entity70 , " @entity23 " " not every country can become a democracy at the snap of a finger , but @entity3 might well be ready for it			1
and that would be the best outcome , as i say , of a lot of bad choices			0
@entity9 can not continue in the long term with the oppressive regime he 's had now			1
the demonstrators have shown that			0
" -- @entity85 sen. @entity84 , " @entity23 " " people in @entity3 have shown during this time a great deal of solidarity , a great deal of desire to see their country develop and prosper			1
and i believe that every loyal @entity3 will continue to undertake his responsibilities and contribute towards the improvement of his homeland			1
" -- @entity96 , @entity3 ambassador to the @entity57 , @entity98 's " @entity97 " " what could be realistic is that @entity9 himself becomes convinced , with outside advice , that it is in his interest , as well as in @entity3 's interests , that he goes , and that he sets in motion a process which facilitates that			1
i think the alternatives otherwise are much tougher			0
" -- @entity109 , national security adviser under president @entity110 , " @entity97 " " i 'm not speculating about who goes or who stays			0
and i 'm not prepared to comment on what kind of democratic process the @entity3 people can construct for themselves			1
but we obviously want to see people who are truly committed to democracy , not to imposing any ideology on @entity3 , and therefore we would like to encourage that people who have been the voice of protests and been the voice of civil society be the ones at the table trying to design what would be an orderly transition to meet the democratic and economic needs of the people			1
" -- @entity133 , @entity134 's " @entity132 " " it 's not up to us to give the @entity3 advice about this			1
you know , hopefully this transition will occur relatively peacefully			0
and at the end of it all , i hope we still have an important ally in the @entity143			0
" -- senate minority leader @entity144 , @entity146 's " @entity145 " on where the @entity57 stands : " we are on the side -- as we have been for more than 30 years -- of a democratic @entity3 that provides both political and economic rights to its people , that respects the universal human rights of all @entity3			1
and that is the message that every ambassador , whether @entity71 or @entity85 president , everyone has conveyed for over 30 years			0
" -- @entity133 , " @entity23 " " what 's important to us is @entity3 , it 's not @entity9			1
and @entity9 is not @entity3			1
" -- @entity56 , " @entity23 " " i think that president @entity9 , he knows what 's going on in his own country			1
it 's up to the @entity57 to be a helpful , assisting but insisting partner			2
and by the way , we can not afford a @entity167 in @entity168			0
" -- @entity70 , " @entity23 " on @entity57 aid to @entity3 : " we have sent a very clear message that we want to see restraint , we do not want to see violence by any security forces , and we continue to convey that message			1
there is no discussion as of this time about cutting off any aid			0
we always are looking and reviewing our aid			0
" -- @entity133 , " @entity97 " on whether @entity57 in @entity3 should leave : " we are following the conditions for @entity57 citizens extremely closely			1
this is one of my highest responsibilities			0
and we have authorized voluntary departure , which means that we will assist @entity57 citizens to leave @entity3			1
we have warned that there should not be any nonessential travel to @entity3			2
" -- @entity133 , " @entity188 " on addressing the debt ceiling : " we can come to a reasonable agreement that curbs spending			2
... but to just stay in your corner and say , ' it 's my way or i 'm shutting down the government , ' that could lead to terrible , terrible problems			2
and i would plead with my new @entity71 colleagues in the @entity5 who seem to want to do this , that that is playing with fire			0
please do n't do it			0
" -- @entity84 , " @entity23 " " the president of the @entity57 is asking us to increase the debt limit			0
but on tuesday night , he did n't even address it			0
and i do n't think the @entity57 people will tolerate increasing the debt limit without serious reductions in spending and changes to the budget process , so that we can make sure that this never happens again			2
the other night , all he did was call for more stimulus spending			0
i think our team has been listening to the @entity57 people			2
they want to us reduce spending , and there is no limit to the amount of spending we 're willing to cut			0
" -- @entity5 majority leader @entity4 , " @entity188 " " we have two opportunities to do something important for the country on spending and debt			2
we ought not to miss this opportunity			0
the president ought to step up to the plate with us and tackle it together			0
" -- @entity232 , " @entity145 " on changing the health care legislation : " the president has said he 's open to changes to this			1
he is not open to refighting the entire fight of health care			1
people have suggestions on how to make it better			2
but he 's not in favor of refighting this fight			1
" -- @entity5 chief of staff @entity244 , " @entity132 " on why he cries so much : " i feel pretty strongly about what i do			1
i did n't come to @entity248 to be a congressman			0
i came here to do something			0
and i do n't need to be speaker of the @entity5 because i need some fancy title			0
i came here to do something on behalf of the @entity57 people			2
" -- @entity4 , " @entity188 " on why he smokes : " oh , why do we bring this up again ? you know , smoking			2
it 's a bad habit but i have it			0
and it 's a legal product			0
" -- @entity4 , " @entity188 "			2

@entity3 's future " is going to be up to the @entity3 people , " @entity133 says
@entity37 : " if ( @entity9 ) has an iota of patriotism , i would advise him to leave today "
@entity268 open to changing health care *law* , but not refighting the entire fight , @entity244 says
@entity4 on crying : " i feel pretty strongly about what i do "
