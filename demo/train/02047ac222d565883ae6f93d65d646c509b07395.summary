-- this latest film from master filmmaker @entity2 will be both familiar to his fans and viewed as a departure			1
while it boasts a couple of his regular cast of performers ( including @entity11 for the first time in 21 years ) it is not an original story ( as most of his work is ) and is instead adapted by the director and his frequent collaborator , brother @entity18 , and based on a novel " @entity20 " ( " @entity20 " in the @entity21 ) by @entity22			1
it 's also significantly darker in tone , more subtle , wholly unsentimental and rather more brutal than we 're used to getting from @entity2			1
world famous plastic surgeon @entity26 ( @entity11 ) lives in an isolated compound called @entity28 , a magnificent mansion shut off from the world by trees , a wall and gates			1
in the compound 's laboratory @entity26 is experimenting on a new kind of skin , one developed through the gene therapy called transgenesis , an ethically - challenged procedure that has been banned by @entity26 's superiors			1
using pig cells , @entity26 has developed a new kind of human skin that can resist disease , fire and puncture but still transmits other sensations , like human touch			1
he 's achieved this by experimenting on humans , in strict violation of every ethical standard and contrary to the instructions of his medical superiors			2
one of these human subjects , a young and beautiful woman named @entity60 ( @entity61 , " @entity62 " ) , is his captive in the mansion and is @entity26 's latest guinea pig			2
@entity60 lives in a sealed room			2
her meals and other materials are delivered via dumbwaiter and her only contact with another person is when @entity26 is transplanting skin on to her or when he enters her room at night to give her some opium to smoke			2
@entity26 lives with a caretaker , @entity77 ( @entity78 , " @entity79 , " " @entity62 " ) , who is his willing accomplice in this macabre medical experiment and acts as a mother figure to him			2
she makes meals for @entity60 and is the only other person with whom she has any contact			2
@entity77 also dotes on @entity26 , whose tireless albeit creepy work was triggered by the death of his wife some years before , the victim of a horrible car crash and subsequent burning , hence the flam - resistant pigskin			2
she did n't die from her burns , however			0
in the process of being nursed back to health , she caught sight of her horribly disfigured form in a window reflection and immediately leapt from a window			0
as a result , @entity26 is intent on perfecting a method for healing burn victims			0
it all seems altruistic , but there 's something definitely ...			0
off about @entity26 and not just the beautiful young woman he keeps captive in his house			0
@entity2 is one of the most skillful and consistently magnificent directors of the last 30 + years and while " @entity115 " may be a bit of a departure from what his fans are used to , it is no less of a skillful and intriguing film			1
it is rife with the maestro 's deft touches of the bizarre rubbing up against the commonplace and the erotic is present where perhaps it is not expected			0
at the @entity124 , i took to referring to " skin " as more " @entity126 " or " @entity127 , " referring to @entity128 , whose own offering at this year 's @entity124 fest is also somewhat atypical of the most famous of his works			0
it is significantly darker than much of @entity2 's recent work and contains more than a couple of eye opening " wait			1
he did what ? " moments			1
alas , many of these moments come so deep into the film , that to allude to them could constitute spoilers			1
while it 's possible that some of you may see what 's coming , i did not and i will not deprive you of the singular joy that is a movie - provided " holy crap ! " @entity11 is nothing short of spectacular in what should prove to be a career resurgence for him			1
his @entity26 is all simmering emotion , everything below the surface			0
his is the quiet and determined countenance of the researcher , plying his trade tirelessly for the betterment of humanity ...			0
part of the irony given the subject matter of the film may be that he does n't look any older than he did 20 years ago			0
at the @entity124 where i screened the film , the common reaction of my fellow film goers when asked their thoughts on the film was something along the line of " i 'm not sure , yet			0
" it takes some time to digest , and i think it may perhaps be a film that with time does reveal its secrets and becomes that masterpiece			0
" @entity115 " is rated r and contains graphic violence , sexual situations , rape and some rather unsettling ideas surrounding revenge and psychopathy			1
it is distributed by @entity187 and opens on october 14th .			0

" @entity115 " is significantly darker in tone
it contains more than a couple of eye opening moments
@entity11 is nothing short of spectacular
