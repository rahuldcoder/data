-- during tuesday night 's debate with @entity4 challenger @entity3 , president @entity1 touted his administration 's support for the federal @entity8 program and other aid for college students			1
the claim : " we 've expanded @entity8 for millions of people , including millions of young women , all across the country , " @entity1 said			1
" we did it by taking $ 60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program , and we said , ' let 's just cut out the middleman			1
let 's give the money directly to students			0
' and as a consequence , we 've seen millions of young people be able to afford college , and that 's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace			0
" that 's a big claim in a time of tight budgets , so @entity0 decided to take a closer look			0
fact check : @entity3 , women and jobs the facts : in 2009 and 2010 , the @entity1 administration pushed to eliminate the federal guaranteed student loan program , which subsidized student loans issued through private lenders			1
the administration argued that the money that went to banks through the program would be better spent on direct federal loans to students or to @entity8 , which provide students up to $ 5,600			1
a @entity52 - led @entity51 approved the plan in march 2010 as part of the same budget bill that cemented @entity1 's signature health care legislation			2
it faced heavy opposition from @entity4 , who criticized it as a " government takeover " of the student loan industry			0
but rep. @entity62 , the @entity64 @entity63 who led the @entity65 that oversaw education , argued it ended a " sweetheart deal " for banks			0
during the debate , the nonpartisan @entity70 estimated that the legislation would save the government up to $ 62 billion through 2020			2
fact check : candidates positions on contraception ? much of that money has gone to the @entity8 program , which has grown from about $ 19 billion in 2009 to a requested $ 36 billion for 2013			1
about 10 million students are expected to receive @entity8 next year , up from about 6 million in the 2008 - 09 academic year , according to the @entity80			2
