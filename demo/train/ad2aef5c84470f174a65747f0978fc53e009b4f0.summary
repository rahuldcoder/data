here 's a few messages he tried to push : 1			0
he says he has n't made a decision on running for president : the political calendar is now focused on the next presidential election , but @entity1 appeared no more closer to making a decision on 2016			1
pressed by @entity0 's @entity18 on " @entity19 " to elaborate on his own thought process and the public pressure he 's facing to run , @entity1 did n't budge			1
" i 'll make this decision based on my own time table and not on anybody else 's , " he said			0
as chairman of the @entity26 , @entity1 helped raise more than $ 100 million in the past year and @entity4 gained multiple governorships tuesday night , while still others have yet to be called			1
asked how he can say no to 2016 after having a successful year , @entity1 said : " i do n't know that you 'd say ' no '			1
" " but i have n't said yes , " he continued			0
" that 's a big difference			0
" on @entity34 's " @entity33 , " @entity1 said the past year of traveling gave him and his family a better feel for what a national campaign would be like that			1
but is it fair to say he 's closer to a 2016 run , asked @entity43			0
" no , not fair to say , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's fair to say that what i 'm looking for is a nap			0
he does n't regret yelling at the heckler : even some @entity4 â € ” including @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 â € ” argued @entity1 's sharp reaction to a heckler last week was n't the best way to handle the situation			1
but @entity1 said he has no regrets			2
asked on @entity0 and @entity59 whether he thinks he 'll be able to control his @entity2 temperament if he runs for president , @entity1 took issue with the premise			2
" why would anybody think that what i did last night was n't controlled , first off ? why would they think that i did n't do exactly what i wanted to do ? " he said on @entity0			0
@entity1 said on almost all the shows that he would n't do it differently if he 's interrupted like that again and thinks his style will play just fine in other states " i 'm going to be myself			1
if i decide to run for something and that 's not good enough , then that 's not good enough , " he said			0
i 'm not going to change who i am -- not for anybody " asked on @entity59 whether he might at least try to " hide " that part of his personality , @entity1 candidly replied , " there 's no hope for that			2
he says he 's not trying to take credit for tuesday night 's success : @entity1 was strategic in trying to keep the candidates in the spotlight wednesday morning , saying on @entity59 that " the candidates deserve the credit -- it 's always about the candidates			1
" when @entity94 on @entity95 asked if his morning show appearances could be called a victory lap , @entity1 said with a straight face : " you can certainly call it an acknowledgment of a lot of hard work by a lot of great governors			1
" the sweetest personal victory for him , he said on @entity95 , was gov. @entity108 's re-election victory in @entity109			0
but he added that @entity4 pickups in blue states like @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 were also great			2
" i love that map this morning , " he said on @entity115			0
" it looks absolutely fabulous			0
" he did n't hesitate to take some shots at @entity113 gov. @entity119 , who 's openly considering a 2016 presidential run , saying the @entity4 's win in @entity113 is a rejection of @entity119 's policies of " high taxes and big spending			1
" " even for @entity113 it got to be too much , " @entity1 said on @entity95			2
tuesday night was also a message to @entity127 : @entity1 said on @entity115 that tuesday night 's results were a " a reflection of the president 's lack of leadership			1
" " the biggest emotion i saw ( when traveling ) was anxiety , " he said			0
" we used to control events , now events control us			0
