-- after two space shuttle flights in the 1980s , astronaut @entity1 spent much of the rest of her life trying to encourage children , particularly girls , to give the sciences a shot			1
@entity1 , the first @entity9 woman in space , was part of a wave of women who entered the traditionally male disciplines of natural sciences and engineering in the 1970s			1
one of those she inspired was @entity19 , who told @entity0 's " newsroom " that she never considered becoming an astronaut before meeting @entity1 in 1982			1
" when i 'd think of what they look like , it 's those @entity25 standing in front of an airplane , a bunch of guys that were older than me with not as much hair , " she said			0
" and suddenly you meet @entity1 , and it became clear to me that maybe this is something i can pursue			1
" the human , funny side of @entity1 @entity37 joined the @entity38 , became an astronaut and has racked up more than 4,300 hours in space , including two space shuttle flights and a five - month stint aboard the international space station			1
" all of us would like to make a difference , but @entity1 changed the world , " she said			1
@entity1 opens a new frontier for others the number of women earning science or engineering degrees grew from about 50,000 in 1966 to about 240,000 in 2006 , according to figures from the @entity55			1
@entity1 died monday at age 61			1
she joined @entity58 's astronaut corps in 1978 , the same year she earned a @entity59 in physics at @entity62 's @entity61			2
at the time , women earned about 4 % of the physics degrees , said @entity65 , a senior researcher at the @entity66			2
that number is about 20 % today , @entity65 said			0
" she was a real pioneer			0
things have really improved dramatically in her lifetime , " @entity65 said			0
opinion : thank you , @entity1 @entity74 , the president of the @entity75 , served with @entity1 on the board of the @entity77 , an industry - backed effort to boost those subjects			1
he said ride was always friendly and good humored , " an inspiration to everybody			0
" " i do n't think i have attended a single major event on k - 12 science and education where she was n't present , " he said			2
" my own granddaughter attended one or two @entity1 events in @entity90 and was always inspired by them , and was just devastated when she heard the news			1
" women today make up about half of the graduates in chemistry and mathematics , and are awarded a majority of bachelor 's degrees in biology			2
but in engineering , only about 20 % of graduates are women -- and among all women entering college , only 3 to 5 % choose engineering as a major , said @entity107 , a program manager at the engineering academy			1
tributes pour in for @entity1 " i had the opportunity to work with her and watch some of the students ' eyes light up , " @entity107 said			1
" she had a way to explain the work that she did , and the passion she had for what she did , in a way that was really approachable			0
" @entity1 's efforts focused on middle - school students , typically the point at which students are given a choice of elective courses			2
" many of them probably went back home and said , ' @entity128 , @entity129 , i know what i want to be , ' " @entity107 said			0
but since 2006 , the percentage of women going into the sciences has leveled off , @entity65 said			2
there has been a slight decline in female engineering and physics majors , and the number of women choosing computer science has dropped from about 30 % in the 1980s to about 18 % today			1
@entity65 and @entity107 said female students still battle the stereotype that males do better at math and science -- and in some cases trim their ambitions accordingly			0
dr. @entity1 " fewer girls tend to go on to careers in those areas because they hold themselves to a higher standard and tend to assess their abilities lower , " @entity65 said			2
that 's often true even when girls get higher grades or standardized test scores , she said			0
" role models like @entity1 are so important for reducing the effective stereotype , " @entity65 said			2
" the more you see women succeeding in these areas , the less strong that stereotype is			0
" and @entity74 said studies show appeals to idealism and the potential of new discoveries can help draw women to the field			0
" we 've been doing a very poor job of explaining the versatility of engineering degrees , and how if you want to improve climate and water and health , it 's going to take technological advances to do it , " he said			0
@entity107 said ride " not only walked that , she lived that life in giving back to the community			0
" " it 's hard to overstate the impact that she had on a generation of young women when she made that first spaceflight , " she said			0
" and the fact that she continued to work with young students means she had a ripple effect on several generations			0
" memories of my space flight with @entity1			1

@entity1 was part of a rising wave of women in science and engineering
she spent her *post-space* career trying to get kids *interested* in the subjects
@entity1 , the first @entity9 woman in space , died monday at 61
