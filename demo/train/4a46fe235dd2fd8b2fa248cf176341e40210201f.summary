if you 're tired of nagging your kids to brush their teeth , you have a new ally			2
a @entity7 company has introduced what they 're calling the world 's first connected electric toothbrush , which syncs wirelessly with a smartphone to track brushing habits , announce whether you , or your kids , have brushed thoroughly enough and reward you for good oral hygiene			1
for extra motivation , or shaming , the brush can share information with your social network or even your dentist			0
it 's called the @entity22 toothbrush , and it was unveiled this week at the @entity23 in @entity24 , where some attendees asked if they could test prototypes on their pearly whites right there ( for sanitary reasons , the answer was no )			1
the device will cost from $ 99 to $ 200 , depending on the model , and will be available for pre-order this summer through @entity32 or another crowdfunding site			0
" it works just like a regular toothbrush , " said @entity22 spokesperson @entity34 in a phone interview			2
" the only difference is that all the data is stored on your phone so you can see how you 're brushing			2
" users download a mobile app and connect via @entity44 , and the @entity22 documents every brushing via three sensors that record 1 ) how long you brush , 2 ) whether you brush all four quadrants of your mouth , and 3 ) whether you brush up and down ( good ) instead of just side to side ( bad )			1
the data automatically syncs to your @entity55 phone or @entity56 , telling you whether you brushed long enough and reached all the crucial areas of your teeth and gums			0
the @entity22 app charts your progress and scores your brushing technique to encourage you , or your kids , to improve brushing habits			1
in this way , the device turns a mundane daily activity into a game , which its makers hope will engage people -- especially kids -- and encourage them to brush longer and more often			0
" you create this incentive around brushing , " @entity34 said			0
the brushing data also will be available via an @entity74 to let third - party game designers develop new apps for the @entity78 system			0
the @entity22 toothbrush was invented by @entity80 , a @entity7 engineer and a leader in that country 's tech industry			1
he was inspired to design it after suspecting that his children were lying to him about whether they had brushed their teeth			0
it 's not the first " smart " toothbrush on the market , however : the manual , $ 25 @entity90 went on sale about a year ago			2
the @entity93 also connects to phones via bluetooth and records brushing time , although unlike the @entity22 it can not track the brush 's movements in the mouth .			1
