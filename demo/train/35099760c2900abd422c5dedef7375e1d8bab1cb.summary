@entity0 -- nearly a week after calls for widespread pro-democracy protests fell flat in @entity5 , organizers are making another attempt at rallying support for the so - called " jasmine " demonstrations for this weekend			1
efforts to organize last sunday were deemed largely unsuccessful after casual observers and police outnumbered the few protesters that showed up for the demonstrations			2
on friday , anonymous instructions on a site on @entity18 , which is blocked in @entity5 , encouraged people to show up at central locations in about two - dozen major @entity5 cities and " go for a walk " together this sunday			1
along with @entity18 , @entity23 and @entity24 continue to be blocked , making calls for action available only to those outside mainland @entity5 or to @entity5 who have access to virtual private networks with foreign ip addresses			1
meanwhile , @entity32 , one of the last social networking sites allowed in the country , was blocked in @entity5 on friday as the government ramped up internet censorship			1
this time around , organizers are masking the events as " liang hui " -- a @entity42 term which commonly refers to meetings held each march by @entity5 's political leadership			1
the cleverly selected terminology is an attempt by protest organizers to circumvent censorship on popular microblogs in the lead - up to actual meetings held by the @entity52 and @entity53			2
words such as " jasmine " in @entity5 and " @entity56 " -- the famous @entity0 shopping strip where sunday 's demonstrations are set to begin -- were not searchable on @entity5 's most popular microblog , @entity59 , on friday			0
the @entity5 name of @entity62 ambassador @entity61 -- who showed up at last sunday 's " jasmine " protest in @entity0 -- are also blocked			2
when searching the terms , users see a message that states : " according to relevant laws and policies , search results can not be shown			0
" @entity61 , wearing a black leather jacked with a patch of the @entity62 flag on his left shoulder , was captured at last week 's protest in a widely viewed video posted on @entity24 , in which he 's called out by some in the crowd			0
one asks if he is " hoping @entity5 will become chaotic ? " -- a reference to the unrest that has consumed several countries in @entity82 and the @entity83 as protesters there demand democracy			0
speaking in @entity42 , @entity61 tells them that he " just came to have a look			0
" the hecklers accuse him of pretending to not know about the protest and feigning ignorance			0
for sunday , organizers have posted details on the @entity18 page encouraging participants to be peaceful			1
in the event of " adverse treatment " the site advised individuals to be as tolerant as possible and show a " high level of @entity5 character " in the " pursuit of democracy and freedom			0
