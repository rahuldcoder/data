-- the international governing body for athletics urged caution friday after reports that the world - champion @entity6 runner @entity5 has both male and female organs			1
the front cover of @entity11 shows @entity5 after a recent makeover			1
the @entity13 in @entity14 and @entity16 newspaper in @entity17 reported that gender tests ordered by the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) show the 18 - year - old is a hermaphrodite			1
neither paper named the source of their information			0
@entity19 spokesman @entity25 would not discuss the findings with @entity0			0
" i simply have n't seen the results , " @entity25 said			0
" we have received the results from @entity30 , but they now need to be examined by a group of experts and we will not be in a position to speak to the athlete about them for at least a few weeks			2
" after that , depending on the results , we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action			2
" has @entity5 been treated fairly ? the @entity19 issued a statement , saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results			2
a final decision regarding the case is not expected before the @entity46 meets in late november in @entity47 , the @entity19 said			0
@entity25 also said the news reports should be treated with caution			2
the newspapers said extensive physical examinations of @entity5 show she has no ovaries , but rather has internal testes , which are producing large amounts of testosterone			1
what is intersexuality ? @entity5 won the women 's 800 - meters gold medal at the @entity60 in @entity61 last month			1
she crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in 1 minute , 55.45 seconds -- the best women 's time in the world this year			2
defending champion @entity67 of @entity68 took the silver and @entity70 of @entity17 claimed bronze			0
the @entity19 said it was seeking tests on @entity5 's gender even before that race			1
@entity25 said questions about her were first raised after her astonishing displays at the @entity6 junior championships in july , with her masculine build and surprising performance fueling the rumors			2
@entity6 reacted angrily to friday 's reports , with one newspaper headline declaring " outrage			1
" sport and recreation minister @entity85 said he was " shocked and disgusted " at the treatment that @entity5 has received from the media , the @entity19 , and the world			1
" she may be a hermaphrodite , but so what ? she is still a girl , " @entity85 told a news conference in @entity93			0
even if @entity5 has an unfortunate " proportion of hormones , " he said , she is still " a young girl enjoying growing up			2
" @entity85 said he believes the teenager 's human rights have been violated and that she was not given a chance to understand what the gender testing was all about			0
@entity6 will fight back if @entity5 is excluded from further competition , @entity85 said , adding , " it will be a third world war			1
" all indications were friday that , at the very least , @entity5 may be able to keep the gold medal she won in @entity61			1
" our legal advice is that , if she proves to have an advantage because of the male hormones , then it will be extremely difficult to strip the medal off her , since she has not cheated , " @entity25 told @entity0			0
@entity5 's countrymen -- including her father and the @entity6 team manager -- have maintained that @entity5 is a female			1
thousands of supporters crammed the airport in @entity116 when she returned from @entity61 last month			0
and this week , the athlete appeared on the cover of a @entity6 magazine wearing makeup , jewelry and a glamorous dress			1
under @entity19 rules , any time there is suspicion about an athlete 's gender , the athlete can be asked to attend a medical evaluation before a panel consisting of a gynecologist , an endocrinologist , a psychologist , an internal medicine specialist and an expert on gender issues			1
there are chromosome tests and scans of the athlete 's body , @entity25 has said			1
he called gender verification -- which is generally required only for female athletes -- " an extremely complex procedure			0
" the process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s , the @entity19 said			0
the first mechanism involved " rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations , " which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes , the @entity19 said			0
there were too many uncertainties regarding the mouth swabs , so the @entity19 abandoned them in 1991 and the @entity156 discontinued them in 2000 , the @entity19 said			0
a proper test has yet to be found , the @entity19 said , and the current round of tests is considered a good interim solution .			0

@entity13 reports tests have *revealed* athlete 's internal testes
@entity6 team manager maintains @entity5 is female
