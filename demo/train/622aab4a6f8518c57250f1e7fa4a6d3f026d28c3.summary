@entity0 -- justice @entity2 is predicting " sharp disagreement " as the @entity4 prepares by month 's end to release some of its most - talked - about rulings , including the constitutionality of the health care law championed by president @entity9			1
speaking to a legal conference friday night in @entity0 , the oldest member of the high court offered tantalizing hints about where the court may be heading in coming days			1
" the term has been more than usually taxing , some have called it the term of the century , " she said in remarks at the @entity18 's annual review of the court			1
the @entity18 is a left - leaning legal advocacy and scholarship group			2
the court in the next two weeks will rule separately on health care , @entity27 's controversial immigration crackdown law , television broadcast indecency enforcement , and a federal law making it a crime to lie about earning high military honors			1
@entity2 called the court 's frantic race to finish their remaining 15 or so rulings " flood season			1
" " as one may expect , many of the most controversial cases remain pending , " she noted			2
" so it is likely that the sharp disagreement rate will go up next week and the week after			0
" @entity2 , among the left - leaning justices , spent several minutes talking about the health care issues , but offered no hints whatsoever on the internal deliberations , or how the court might be leaning			1
but she said her benchmates were fully aware of the public scrutiny the case has attracted			0
@entity2 offers ' greatest hits ' summary of past term " no contest since the court invited new briefs and arguments in ' @entity56 ' ( a 2009 - 10 campaign finance spending case ) has attracted more attention -- in the press , the academy , " she said			1
" some have described the controversy as unprecedented and they may be right if they mean the number of press conferences , prayer circles , protests , counter protests , going on outside the court while oral argument was under way inside			2
" she then explained -- with a dollop of humor -- the four issues the court was considering , including the main focus : the constitutionality of the individual mandate , which would require nearly all @entity76 to buy health insurance starting in 2014 or face a financial penalty			1
" if the individual mandate , requiring the purchase of insurance or the payment of a penalty , if that is unconstitutional , must the entire act fall ? " she said , then outlining another key question			0
" or , may the mandate be chopped , like a head of broccoli , from the rest of the act ? " that brought laughter to the knowing crowd , since many critics warn giving @entity95 the power to force the mandate on people would be a " slippery slope " -- and that lawmakers could then force people to buy broccoli in the name of ensuring a healthy populace			0
she then made light of the initial question argued by the justices back in march			0
@entity4 cuisine : new cookbook honors late husband of @entity2 " the big question inviting the answer everyone is waiting for : do federal courts lack jurisdiction to entertain a pre-enforcement challenge to the individual mandate in light of the anti-injunction act of 1867 , " she said			2
" that act prohibits any person from suing the federal government to restrain the assessment or collection of any tax			0
" while legally dense , the " anti-injunction " question was considered the least important issue taken up by the court , and one most legal analysts were sure the bench will ignore , allowing the justices to go ahead and tackle the larger , more vital constitutional questions			0
the final issue being debated internally is whether the @entity137 's expansion of @entity138 exceeds @entity95 ' power			0
some of those watching @entity2 's speech noted her remarks regarding the power of dissents issued by the high court , and whether she was signaling how @entity95 might follow up to however the health care cases are decided			1
" i have spoken on more than one occasion about the utility of dissenting opinions , noting in particular that they can reach audiences outside the court and can propel legislative or executive change , " she said			0
in this context , the 79 - year - old justice was speaking about her much - discussed 2007 dissent in a pay discrimination claim that resulted in an @entity160 woman being denied the ability to seek back wages , after alleging her fellow male supervisors were being paid more than her for years , for the same work			0
@entity95 changed the rules following that high court ruling , and president @entity9 signed the @entity167 in 2009 , one of his first acts in office			2
the @entity4 will next issue opinions monday morning , but many court watchers believe the justices will wait until the week of june 25 to bring out the health care opinions , just before they recess for the summer			1
@entity2 repeated what many at the court have long known when trying to speculate what the court will do , and when			2
" at the @entity4 , those who know do n't talk , " she said , smiling			0
" and those who talk do n't know			0
" health care reform : issues round - up @entity1 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report			1

" the term has been more than usually taxing , " @entity2 says
the court is expected to rule in coming weeks on high - *profile* cases , including health care
she offers no hints on internal deliberations
