-- when i was a teen , i tried to read the entire @entity2			0
my goal : memorize its contents , be on tv game shows , win cash and prizes , run away from home , move to @entity10 and become a professional writer			2
instead of focusing on getting mr. @entity12 , focus on finding @entity13 , says author			2
i got as far as @entity15			0
to this day , i know a little about a lot of words beginning with " @entity18 " some favorites : ants , atoms , alchemy			0
plus , @entity23 was a childhood crush , because i 've always loved philosophy			1
when i finished reading his one - page encyclopedic write - up , i bought books about him			2
i 'd been saving these dog - eared , underlined @entity23 books , as well as the " a " book of @entity2 , all to be used in a novel , where i 'd been planning to bless my protagonist with the quirky detail of knowing all things " @entity18 " i recently rediscovered these @entity23 books when moving apartments			1
i flipped through and was surprised to discover @entity23 said a lot of the same things about love and happiness as modern psychologists			1
only @entity23 obviously said it first , having been born at least 300 years @entity43 , @entity23 said it truly wisely			1
indeed , much of what @entity23 said hit home big - time -- in particular about a sexy , smart , funny , rich , lying , cheating , do n't - get - me - started prince harming i 'd just broken up with			1
i could almost hear what @entity23 might say to me if we were to chat over souvlaki			1
' sold your soul to be with him ' " @entity53 , @entity54 , " @entity23 would say			1
" you know what your problem was with your ex ? he was not your soul mate -- but your ' sold ' mate -- because you sold your soul to be with him			1
sure he was sexy , smart , rich , funny -- but alas , he was a liar and a cheat			0
" " you 're an intellectual guy			0
" i 'd correct the regaled philosopher called the " @entity65 " by @entity64			2
" i 'm surprised you believe in something as namby - pamby metaphysical as a soul mate ! " @entity0 : 10 rules to soul mate love " absolutely ! " my fave @entity73 philosopher buddy @entity72 would respond emphatically			1
" actually , i sort of coined the concept of ' soul mate			1
' if there 'd been a little @entity78 trademark thingy back in the @entity79 , i 'd be a very rich man today			0
i firmly believe caretaking the soul is incredibly important for happiness			1
i describe a soul mate as a ' soul - nurturing mate			1
' someone who nurtures your soul , thereby promoting insight and growth			1
i pushed folks to find soul mates because , in my opinion , real happiness only comes when you stimulate your core self -- and grow into your highest potential			1
basically , the soul is the ultimate g - spot for happiness			1
" of course , i 'm paraphrasing for my philosopher buddy			2
but if @entity23 were here , i know he 'd agree with my verbal modernization			1
plus , @entity72 would go on to describe how he views the world as offering three kinds of relationships , only one of which brings true happiness			1
3 kinds of relationships according to ancient philosopher @entity23 , there are three kinds of relationships , only one of which will bring you true happiness			1
find out how your relationship measures up ! 1			0
relationships of pleasure partners who are about sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll			1
you share soulless , passionate sex and playful banter -- but they 're about the body or ego			0
they never soul - nurture you with insight and growth , so they never bring real - deal happiness			1
@entity0 : how to break your bad man habit 2			0
relationships of utility partners you spend time with in hopes of garnering status , power , money and beauty like the rich guy with a trophy girl			2
again , this is about body or ego and does n't bring true joy			2
relationships of shared virtue partners who challenge and inspire you to grow into your highest potential and nurture your soul			1
a good example is when @entity156 's character in " @entity157 " says , " you make me want to be a better man			2
" when you prioritize seeking a partner who supports you becoming your best self -- instead of crushing on " superficial lures " ( hotness , funniness , smartness , success , etc. ) -- you wind up with a soul mate / a @entity170 / a definite keeper ! with this in mind , if you want to be happy in love , you must take time to see past a guy 's " superficial lures " and look inside his " superinsidehimself			1
" unfortunately , those fumes of chemistry can often dizzy a gal into making stupid love choices			0
that 's why it 's important to remember : hot , steamy chemistry eventually fades -- and what 's always left beneath is a person 's true soul			2
yes , if you want to be happy , you must seek a good - hearted , ethical soul who brings you great growth -- not simply a hottie who brings great grope @entity0 : the best things to do for your relationship confession time : another superficially alluring quality i 've been suckered in by is humor			1
i am @entity200 in a friggin ' funny man 's hands			2
i once had a boyfriend who teased me that the secret to getting me into bed was to crack five good jokes in a night			0
he 'd count down his jokes as the night progressed			0
unfortunately , funniness is a mere decorative quality -- sometimes developed to avoid talking about real - life issues			2
which is why in the past , after a few months of dating a friggin ' funny guy , i 've witnessed all that fabulous ha - ha - ha laughter often gives way to tears when the guy 's true character -- true soul -- shows up as one that avoids honest communication , warm empathy and the desire for growth			1
then , when i try to connect soul to soul -- heart to heart -- i am greeted by a gigantic , unmovable whoopee cushion wall			2
basically , friggin ' funny is only the tiniest tip of a person			0
meanwhile , a person 's soul is a person 's foundation ! for the record : @entity23 was n't against finding someone friggin ' funny or friggin ' sexy or friggin ' rich			1
he believed these pleasure - bringing qualities were good for stirring up passion , which humans need to be our fullest selves ! but @entity23 recognized " superficial lures " and material goods were simply what he called " means to the ends " of happiness , not " the final ends , " which is always to grow into your most esteemed self			1
as @entity23 said : " men imagine the causes of happiness lie in external goods			1
that is as if they were to ascribe fine and beautiful lyre playing to the quality of the instrument rather than the skill of the player			0
" or as i like to say , " it 's just as easy to complain about a rich man as it is to complain about a poor man			0
" basically , it does n't matter how rich a guy is if his behavior makes you twitchy and miserable			0
while on the subject of money , @entity23 was no fan of slackers either			2
he recognized that being or dating poor brought its share of problems			0
he even admitted the lack of a certain amount of wealth was as much an obstacle to happiness as deprivation of freedom			0
he gladly accepted that some wealth was needed to be happy -- just as exciting bodily pleasures were needed			0
but again , wealth and bodily pleasures were mere means to the ends of happiness -- these ultimate ends being to nourish your soul , so you can reach your most esteemed level of self			1
a big secret to happiness ? stop focusing on finding a mr. @entity13 ! start focusing on finding @entity13			0
when a mr. @entity12 comes along , you must ask yourself if this guy will lead you to @entity13 or @entity305			0
as you get to know the guy , look to see if he : 1			0
offers you exciting growth as well as exciting grope 2			0
has developed good character -- so he 'll be a positive influence on your character development			0
if the guy scores two for two , you 're likely in @entity170 territory			0
@entity0 : what you could learn from dating 100 men adapted by @entity317 from her book , " @entity319			0
" she is a best - selling author known for creating self - help for people who would n't be caught dead reading self - help			2
