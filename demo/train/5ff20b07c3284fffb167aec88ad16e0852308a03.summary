four years ago , @entity0 lost everything he loved			1
his son , @entity3 , his daughter - in - law , summer , and their two little boys -- @entity8 , 4 , and @entity3 , 3 -- vanished			1
" from @entity10 , i just had this gut feeling that i was never going to see them again , " he said , swallowing tears			0
something told me , i was n't going to see them again			1
" the @entity15 disappeared from their home in suburban @entity17 in february 2010			1
there were no signs of a struggle			0
no apparent plan to flee			0
nearly four years later , the mother , father and two boys were found slain in the @entity25 -- their bodies buried in shallow graves			1
how did they get there ? who killed them ? from the beginning , the case has baffled investigators , but they are n't giving up			1
said @entity35 , sheriff of @entity36 , in an exclusive interview with @entity38 : " it is certainly my hope that at some point in the future , we 'll be able to solve this , and bring the suspect or suspects to justice			0
" @entity0 's brother to killers : ' you guys are cowards ' the disappearance february 4 , 2010 , began as an ordinary day in the @entity0 home in @entity55 , a community of about 30,000 people about 18 miles from the @entity58 and 50 miles north of @entity17			1
@entity0 spoke on the phone with his son , who ran a custom water feature business , and was scheduled to have a lunch meeting around noon			0
@entity63 spent the day caring for the kids and overseeing the family 's home renovation			1
they were looking forward to their youngest son 's birthday party that weekend			1
but that night , the family of four suddenly left the house -- the doors locked , the car gone			0
inexplicably , their two beloved dogs were left outside without food or water			0
" ( it 's ) as if you took off really fast but were coming back , " said @entity79 , @entity63 's mother , who is divorced from @entity0			1
" your thoughts are going wild			0
' well , why would they be missing ? ' something 's not right here , " she said			1
the investigation early evidence pointed investigators south			2
four days after the @entity15 disappeared , detectives say the family 's white @entity91 was parked and subsequently towed from a parking lot just steps from the @entity95 border			2
and the car was n't the only clue			2
after they found the @entity99 , investigators discovered someone at the @entity0 home had done a computer search for getting passports to @entity95			1
they also found surveillance video showing a family of four matching the @entity15 ' description crossing on foot into @entity95 on february 8			1
" i just thought , well , maybe they took off , " said @entity3 's mother			1
but his father was n't buying it			1
" i said right up front , the first time i saw it ( the surveillance footage ) , it was n't them , " said @entity0 , adding that @entity112 was afraid of @entity95			2
" would @entity112 take her two children in there ? @entity121 , no , " he said			0
missed opportunities @entity0 worried detectives were chasing dead - end clues			0
" i could have probably hired some @entity125 and done a better job , " he said			1
he reached out to @entity127 , founder of the nonprofit search - and - rescue organization @entity128 , which , in turn , contacted freelance investigative journalist @entity130 for help			0
one point that raised questions for @entity130 was the last known call from @entity63 's cell phone			1
the call was to a friend , @entity136			0
it came in about 40 minutes after a neighbor 's security camera captured the family 's @entity99 pulling out of the @entity142 's cul - de - sac			2
among those questions , @entity130 said , were , " did @entity3 actually make that call from his phone , or did somebody else take @entity3 's phone and make that call ? was he trying to call for help ? " the journalist also noted the impact of the delay in reporting the family missing to law enforcement			1
@entity3 's brother contacted authorities 11 days after the @entity15 disappeared			1
he says he waited because he did n't want to overreact , and thought the family might just be on vacation			2
" the first few hours are so critical , the first few minutes ... the beginning of someone trying to commit a crime against you , that 's the only chance you have to get out , " @entity130 said			2
2013 : who were the @entity15 ? the bodies the call the family feared finally came in november 2013 , from an off - roading motorcyclist in the @entity25			1
more than 150 miles from the @entity173 - @entity95 border , and some 100 miles north of the @entity142 home , the biker found what looked to be part of a human skull in a remote area of @entity179 , @entity180			1
authorities investigated and found four skeletons in two shallow graves			1
with the help of dental records , they determined the bodies belonged to the @entity15			2
once considered a missing persons case , the investigation moved to homicide			2
it also switched jurisdictions -- passing from the @entity193 to the @entity194			0
@entity195 , with the @entity17 department , defended her office 's handling of the case			1
" this is an incredibly thorough investigation , " she said , her hand atop a thick stacks of files			0
" thumbing through it , i can see phone records , i see photographs , i see communications			0
" and to have done all of this -- to have compiled this kind of a massive file and still not know the answer -- enormously frustrating , " @entity195 said last year , soon after the remains were discovered			0
the @entity193 is no longer commenting on the case			2
it refers all questions to @entity36 , which declines to get into specifics , citing the ongoing investigation			0
summer 's mother , brother and sister also declined to comment to @entity38			2
the mystery detectives still have not named any suspects or persons of interest			0
" there was certainly evidence found in and around the grave sites , but at this point we 're not prepared to talk about what evidence we did locate , " said @entity35 , the @entity36 sheriff			2
@entity130 said the only way the case will be cracked now is if someone talks			0
" there was more than one person involved in this case because not one person dragged four people out to the desert and buried them single - handedly , " he said			1
" as the pieces begin to come together , it 's looking to me like it was extremely orchestrated			0
so we have to ask ourselves , why ? " like @entity130 , @entity0 believes the killer , or killers , has to be someone who hated his family for a reason -- but that reason is unclear			0
" it 's like a play			0
the first act has just ended			0
we 've got three more acts to go , " he said .			0

" i could have probably hired some @entity125 and done a better job , " says @entity3 's father
