@entity0 -- @entity3 workmen scaled the roof of the @entity5 saturday , as they installed the chimney which will release the black or white smoke that signifies whether a new pope has been elected			1
the chimney is the first publicly visible sign of the preparations going on inside the chapel , which is where the @entity14 cardinals will gather on tuesday for the start of the conclave -- the secret papal election			1
footage released by the @entity3 has shown the installation of two stoves inside the chapel			1
one is used to burn the cardinals ' ballots after they are cast and the other to send up the smoke signal			2
if no one has won , a chemical is added to make the smoke black			0
this lets people waiting in @entity31 below -- and the people watching on tv around the world -- know what is happening			0
white smoke means a new pope has been chosen			1
if the smoke is released after dark , a spotlight will be trained on the chimney so that it can still be seen , @entity3 spokesman the rev. @entity38 said saturday			1
the stove will be tested before the conclave to make sure it can produce smoke , @entity38 said , but privately , so as not to cause too much excitement			1
the cardinals met saturday morning for the latest in a series of sessions known as @entity50			0
these are open to all the cardinals , not just those aged under 80 , and are an important part of the preparations for the election			0
as well as getting to know their counterparts from around the world , the cardinals discuss the major issues facing the church , including its handling of allegations of child sex abuse by priests and a scandal over leaks from the @entity3 last year that revealed claims of corruption , as well as the church 's future direction			2
the final @entity71 will take place on monday , the @entity3 said			2
more than 130 cardinals have already spoken at the meetings			0
once the conclave starts , the 115 cardinal - electors ca n't leave @entity3 until the process is done and are n't allowed to speak with anyone outside of the conclave			1
they stay in a @entity3 hotel , @entity81 , for the duration and , in line with tradition , drew lots for their rooms during saturday 's meeting			2
' praying a lot ' the cardinal - electors will move into @entity81 first thing on tuesday , the @entity3 said			1
they will then attend a special morning @entity91 in @entity92			0
the first vote will be held that afternoon , with subsequent ballots cast over the following days until one of the contenders gains the two - thirds majority that means he is elected head of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity14			1
the longest conclave held since the turn of the 20th century lasted five days			0
the @entity5 , whose famous ceiling was painted by @entity105 artist @entity104 , has been closed to tourists while the preparations for the conclave are made			1
cardinal @entity108 of @entity109 , one of about a dozen leading candidates to become pope , wrote in a blog post friday that he misses @entity109 after 10 days and is sorry he wo n't be there on @entity114			2
" we cardinals sure are praying a lot , " he said			0
contrary to media reports , he said , the focus of the cardinals ' meetings is much the same as it was two millenia ago , namely : " how most effectively to present the person , message , and invitation of @entity126 to a world that , while searching for salvation and eternal truth , are also at times doubting , skeptical , too busy , or frustrated			0
" this means discussions on such subjects as preaching , teaching the faith , care of the poor and sick , and support for the church 's clergy and the families that make up their congregations , @entity108 said			0
" those are the ' big issues			0
' you may find that hard to believe , since the ' word on the street ' is that all we talk about is corruption in the @entity3 , sexual abuse , money			2
do these topics come up ? yes ! do they dominate ? no ! " he wrote			0
ring destroyed meanwhile , the @entity155 press is full of speculation about which cardinal may win enough support from his counterparts to be elected , and what regional alliances are being formed			1
the @entity161 has 11 of the 115 votes , making it the second largest national bloc after @entity155			0
@entity38 , the @entity3 spokesman , said saturday that the symbolic @entity165 and the seal that @entity167 used as pope have been scratched to render them invalid			1
three other symbols of @entity167 's papacy were destroyed in the same way , he said			1
the next pope will get a new @entity165 and seal with his own name on it after he is elected			1
@entity167 resigned 10 days ago , becoming the first pontiff to do so in six centuries			2
