-- @entity2 star @entity1 is a 10 - time @entity4 all - star and the first @entity5 in history to receive the @entity7			1
born into an extraordinarily athletic family , the 7 - foot @entity8 dabbled in a variety of sports -- from tennis to soccer -- before finding his calling as a teen			1
the 32 - year - old power forward is now enjoying his 13th year in the @entity4 and has recently signed a contract worth $ 80 million over four years -- making him @entity8 's second highest paid sports star after @entity20 legend @entity19			1
but @entity2 is a long way from his small suburban hometown of @entity23 , in the heart of @entity8			1
@entity1 , also known as the " @entity1 , " recently sat down with @entity0 's @entity25 to talk about his @entity27 roots and his life on and off the court			1
an edited version of the interview follows : @entity0 : how did your upbringing affect your life as an adult ? @entity1 : my parents were big into sports			1
my dad was a handball player , and my mom played basketball -- so basically i was in the gym every day			1
i played all kinds of sports when i was young : tennis , handball , basketball , some soccer			2
i focused on basketball when i was 16 or 17 and then came to the @entity51 when i was 20			2
@entity0 : your parents must be very proud of you ? @entity54 : they are my biggest fans			1
my mom gets so nervous still -- i mean i 've been in this league for 13 years and she still ca n't watch games live			0
she gets so anxious and when i miss a shot , she 's like : " what 's wrong with him ? why 's he missing ? " my dad never really played basketball , but now he 's my biggest critic			1
i come home and he 's says : " why did n't you shoot there ? why did n't you drive ? " @entity0 : what do you miss about @entity8 ? @entity54 : just my family really			1
everything else nowadays you can get over the internet , like food and that sort of stuff			0
it 's so cold in the winter there , so i 'm glad i miss the whole winter time			2
but , you know , when i do n't see ( my sister 's ) kids for like two to three months , they change so much , and you miss them a lot			2
that 's really the only thing			2
@entity0 : you must get a lot of love from @entity8 people ? @entity54 : germans are everywhere			1
every time i 'm on the road somewhere , somebody has a @entity8 sign , and @entity8 come here to visit me a lot			1
last year for the all - star game that was here in @entity2 , i had 20 to 25 people come and stay at my house			1
every summer i go home and play for the national team and have a lot of followers there so , yeah , they treat me great and hopefully it will continue like that for the last couple of years of my career			2
@entity0 : you 're the second highest - paid @entity8 athlete behind @entity19			1
how do you feel about that ? @entity54 : it 's really nice , i mean @entity19 is obviously the man			2
what is it -- he 's won six championships ? and now he finally has this huge comeback with @entity114 -- the @entity8 car			1
but to me it was never about the money			2
it 's nice to know that i 'll never have to worry about money for the rest of my life once i retire , but really that 's about it			1
i never came here for the money			2
i came here to compete with the best players in the world			0
@entity0 : you 're more than just a basketball player			0
away from the game you play music ? @entity54 : instrument wise i 'd been struggling with the saxophone for a long time			0
then i had my teeth knocked out and i could n't really bite on it anymore , so i quit that			0
i started to play the guitar for a couple of years which was fun			0
i still bring it out once in a while , could bust out a couple of songs but i 'm not very good at it			0
@entity0 : you 're always flashing a smile on court			0
are you always so happy , or is that a misconception ? @entity54 : yeah i like to have fun , but sometimes i do get a little fired up that i have to calm myself down			0
off the floor i 'm really laid back , like nothing really fazes me too much			0
but on the floor i do get emotional and a little carried away			0
however , i started playing when i was 13 to have fun with my teammates , and that never stopped			0
i enjoy traveling and having fun in the locker room with the guys			0
life is too short to be miserable			0
@entity0 : what are your remaining goals ? maybe a gold medal at the @entity164 ? @entity54 : i think @entity165 , that was my big dream just to get there once -- and we did that in @entity169 in 2008			0
i got to carry the flag for @entity8 and led my nation into the stadium which , to this day , is one of the greatest days of my life			1
so to me , that chapter is kind of over and done with			0
i do n't know if i could top that in any way .			0
