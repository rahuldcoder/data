-- the outlook for the underequipped members of the @entity4 opposition appeared to brighten thursday on the eve of a @entity7 meeting in @entity8			1
diplomatic sources told @entity0 that a number of @entity12 nations are supplying arms to the @entity4 opposition			1
the sources would n't identify which countries			2
in @entity18 , @entity17 secretary of state @entity16 predicted the opposition will find willing sources to supply them with munitions to counter the @entity4 government onslaught blamed for thousands of deaths since last march			1
" there will be increasingly capable opposition forces , " she said thursday			2
" they will find somewhere , somehow the means to defend themselves , as well as begin offensive measures and the pressure will build on @entity30 and @entity31			1
world opinion is not going to stand idly by			0
" @entity30 and @entity31 both vetoed a @entity34 resolution that would have condemned the @entity4 government for attacking its people			1
also thursday , @entity17 officials told @entity0 they are considering providing the opposition with nonlethal aid -- such as secure radio communications and training			1
that is a step beyond what the @entity45 administration was saying tuesday , when it was still clinging to the hope that political solutions would end the bloodshed			0
" we do n't believe that it makes sense to contribute now to the further militarization of @entity7 , what we do n't want to see is the spiral of violence increase , " @entity51 spokeswoman @entity50 said			1
" that said , if we ca n't get @entity60 to yield to the pressure that we are all bringing to bear , we may have to consider additional measures			2
" @entity64 foreign minister @entity63 has recently suggested that , beyond humanitarian aid and diplomatic solutions , " we need to think about contingencies as well			0
" both the @entity17 military and intelligence community have expressed concern about providing arms to an opposition whose composition is unclear			1
the 70 - plus countries and international organizations gathering friday in @entity77 are expected to unveil a plan for delivering emergency aid to the @entity4 people and issue a stern warning to president @entity60			1
they want him to agree to an immediate cease - fire and provide access to humanitarian groups to deliver the aid or face a yet - to - be mentioned response from the world community			0
a draft of the document , shared with @entity0 , calls on " the @entity4 government to implement an immediate cease - fire and to allow free and unimpeded access by the @entity95 and humanitarian agencies to carry out a full assessment of needs in @entity99 and other areas			1
" diplomats cautioned the draft was subject to change			0
what 's more , the @entity104 will recognize the opposition @entity106 , members of which will be at the session , as a credible representative of the @entity4 people			1
the @entity17 insists it will not provide weapons to the @entity4 opposition , and will leave it to others who have expressed an interest in doing so			1
nobody told @entity117 they armed the @entity118 and officials said they expect the same nod - wink in @entity7			2
neither @entity30 , which is a @entity122 - era ally and arms dealer to @entity7 , nor @entity31 is participating			1
preparations for the @entity77 meeting coincided with the release thursday of a @entity95 report that identifies @entity4 commanders and high - ranking officials who may be responsible for " widespread , systematic and gross human rights violations " and apparent crimes against humanity			1
the violations have been conducted with the " apparent knowledge and consent " of the country 's " highest levels , " the @entity133 on the @entity4 says			2
thousands have died in @entity7 since mid-march of 2011 , when the government launched a crackdown against protesters			2
at least 101 deaths were reported thursday , including 14 children and a soldier killed when he refused to open fire on people , the opposition @entity143 said			1
seventeen unidentified corpses were found in a military prison in the @entity153 area of @entity155 province , the group said			2
residents told the @entity143 they believe it 's likely most of these unidentified bodies were of soldiers who had defected			0
opposition forces reported more shelling of @entity99 , the 20th consecutive day of attacks on the besieged city at the center of resistance			0
on thursday , the @entity95 announced the appointment of former secretary - general @entity167 as joint special envoy of the @entity95 and @entity169 on the @entity4 crisis			1
@entity167 will be tackling an environment described by the @entity95 commission report as one in which most of the citizenry is " in a state of disarray			1
" " the government has manifestly failed in its responsibility to protect the population , " the report says			0
" anti-government armed groups have also committed abuses , although not comparable in scale and organization with those carried out by the state			0
" meanwhile , @entity187 and @entity188 demanded @entity4 president @entity60 cease attacks against @entity99 so three journalists can receive medical care , even as reports emerged thursday of renewed shelling in the flashpoint city			1
the journalists were in @entity99 to document attacks by @entity60 's forces when they were wounded in shelling , which also killed @entity17 reporter @entity200 and @entity188 photographer @entity201			0
@entity202 has denied targeting civilians , saying his forces are after " terrorists " and foreign fighters bent on destabilizing @entity7			2
evidence that civilians are being killed by government forces has been documented by citizen journalists who post their work on social media websites and @entity212			0
the opposition reports the death toll exceeds 9,000			0
@entity0 and other media outlets often can not independently verify opposition or government reports because the @entity4 regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists			2
the @entity4 @entity223 denied @entity7 was responsible for the deaths on wednesday of two journalists " who infiltrated its territory on their own , " according to a banner on @entity4 state tv			1
the @entity231 summoned @entity232 , the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity187 , and political director sir @entity233 said @entity7 was expected to facilitate the return of the bodies of the two journalists and to provide medical treatment to @entity187 photographer @entity237			1
@entity237 and @entity188 reporter @entity238 of @entity239 were wounded in the shelling in the @entity99 neighborhood of @entity99			0
@entity238 said in a @entity212 video that she needed immediate medical treatment			0
" my leg is broken , the length of my femur			0
i need to be operated on as quickly as possible , the doctors have treated me as best as they can except they can not perform any surgical operations , so i need as quickly as possible , during a cease - fire , a car with medical equipment or at least in good condition to take me to @entity253 to be treated as quickly as possible , " she said			0
dr. @entity254 , who has been treating the wounded journalists in @entity99 , said @entity238 was in critical condition and @entity237 had been moved to a " safe house , " which the physician said was a misnomer			0
" the problem is that we do n't have a safe place , anywhere secure , in @entity99 , " @entity254 told @entity0 thursday in an telephone interview			2
he bemoaned the lack of medical supplies			0
" we just have the basics , " he said			0
" i have to admit , all very primitive			0
" @entity0 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			0
