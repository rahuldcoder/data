-- a leading spokesman for @entity2 has said he is stepping down , citing organizational shortcomings and clashes with the group 's founder			1
@entity9 , who was known as @entity9 while acting as spokesman , said the whistle - blower website has structural problems stemming from its rapid growth , the @entity8 magazine @entity7 reported monday			1
@entity2 was thrust into the international spotlight earlier this year when it released some 76,000 pages of @entity17 documents related to the war in @entity19			2
" because of the high pressure we have all been under following the publication of the @entity17 military documents , we have not been able to restructure our organization accordingly			0
this has created a situation in which not all of the work is being done correctly , and that is overwhelming the project , " @entity9 said , according to @entity7			2
" @entity2 has a structural problem			1
i no longer want to take responsibility for it , and that 's why i am leaving the project , " he said			0
@entity9 is one of a handful of people to have spoken on behalf of @entity2 , as the task typically falls to the website 's founder , @entity39			1
@entity9 told @entity7 he had clashed with @entity39 over what he saw as the founder 's increasing concentration of resources on fewer and larger leaks , and over whether @entity39 should take a more back - seat role following the rape and molestation allegations made against him in @entity49 last month			1
" in my opinion it would have been best if he ( @entity39 ) had pulled back a bit so that he could quietly deal with these problems			2
it would have been fine if he had continued his normal work out of the spotlight			0
but he clearly saw my internal proposal as an attack on his role , " @entity7 reported @entity9 said			0
according to the account , and a posting on @entity2 ' twitter page , @entity9 was suspended from the organization about a month ago			2
" @entity39 reacted to any criticism with the allegation that i was disobedient to him and disloyal to the project			0
four weeks ago , he suspended me -- acting as the prosecutor , judge and hangman in one person , " @entity9 told @entity7			0
@entity2 has previously said it plans to publish another 15,000 documents related to the war in @entity19 soon , while @entity9 told the @entity8 magazine the group has additional leaks in the works			1
" through our rising recognition in the last six months , we have again received a lot of material that urgently needs to be processed and published , " he said .			0
