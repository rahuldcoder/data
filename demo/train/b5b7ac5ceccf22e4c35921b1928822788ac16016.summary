@entity0 -- @entity0 public schoolchildren will spend a seventh day out of classes tuesday as their striking teachers weigh a tentative proposal to end their walkout			1
school officials went to court monday to ask a judge to declare the strike illegal and order the teachers back to work			1
a @entity14 judge will hold a hearing on that request wednesday			1
in the meantime , @entity18 delegates are scheduled to convene again tuesday afternoon to discuss a proposed settlement			1
and parents and city officials scrambled to keep about 350,000 children busy and out of trouble as the strike stretched into its second week			1
" it is frustrating for me that the kids are not in school , and i have to find other ways to continue their education , " said parent @entity26 , who said he 's sympathetic to both sides in the dispute			1
" hopefully , it wo n't last too much longer ... after this week , something 's going to have to change			1
" @entity35 , the third - largest @entity37 school system , and the union struck a tentative bargain friday afternoon			0
but sunday , union members decided to continue the walkout while its they reviewed the proposal			0
" we have 26,000 teachers , and they 're all able to to read this document and take some time to discuss its merits or its deficiencies , and that 's going to happen today , " union spokesman @entity44 told @entity1			1
" we 're just asking people to be patient and let the process run its course			0
" @entity54 : what 's behind the @entity0 teachers ' strike ? but mayor @entity58 vowed sunday night to force the teachers back into the classroom , calling the teachers ' move " a delay of choice that is wrong for our children			1
" the school system went to court monday morning , arguing that the walkout violates @entity71 labor laws			0
" state law expressly prohibits the @entity18 from striking over non-economic issues , such as layoff and recall policies , teacher evaluations , class sizes and the length of the school day and year , " the district said in a statement			2
" the @entity18 's repeated statements and recent advertising campaign have made clear that these are exactly the subjects over which the @entity18 is striking			1
" the strike also prevents " critical educational and social services , including meals for students who otherwise may not receive proper nutrition , a safe environment during school hours and critical services for students who have special needs , " the district continued			2
@entity14 circuit judge @entity96 has scheduled a hearing on the district 's request for 10:30 a.m. wednesday			1
the system is n't asking the judge to settle the dispute that led to the walkout , just to order the teachers back to work			1
the union responded to the filing monday by saying it " appears to be a vindictive act instigated by the mayor			0
" " this attempt to thwart our democratic process is consistent with mayor @entity58 's bullying behavior toward public school educators , " the union said			2
teachers walked off the job september 10 , objecting to a longer school day , evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings			1
parents have juggled their families ' schedules for more than a week to make sure their children are attended to while schools are closed			2
" besides the daycare issue , they just need to be in school , " said @entity128 , a parent who took part in a protest outside the school district 's headquarters on monday			1
" their competitors in charter schools and private schools are learning , while our kids are not			0
" interview with a parent on the impact of the strike with the strike continuing , the school system planned to open 147 " @entity148 " sites citywide monday for students to go to , in addition to programs run by the city 's park department and neighborhood organizations , @entity156 president @entity155 said			1
@entity155 said that he , like the mayor , is " extremely disappointed " that such programs are necessary			0
" there is no reason why our kids can not be in school while the union reviews the agreement , " he said			0
but @entity165 , the mother of another student , said she stood behind the teachers and the union			2
" i think its going to be settled this week , but i understand what the teachers are doing and they 've got to read that fine print , " @entity168 said as she picked up her daughter at a @entity148 program in the @entity172 district			1
" i feel that the whole nation needs to understand that this is a fight for the middle class , " @entity168 said			0
" democrats are talking about supporting the middle class			0
this is the fight that has to be waged			0
" @entity18 members reconvene tuesday afternoon following a break on monday for the @entity185 , @entity185			1
they could decide to end the strike at that point , which could mean classes coming back wednesday			1
but the rank and file would still have the opportunity to accept or reject the proposed contract , and @entity18 president @entity193 said a " clear majority " of their delegates did not want to suspend the strike			1
" they are not happy with the agreement , " she said			0
why they teach despite it all negotiations have taken place behind closed doors while the public debate has been marked by sometimes biting remarks and vocal picketing around the schools			0
@entity209 said one problem is that " there 's no trust " of school board members , with job security the chief issue			2
" the big elephant in the room is the closing of 200 schools , " she said			0
the teacher " are concerned about this city 's decision on some level to close schools			1
" it was not immediately clear where @entity209 got the 200 figure or when she believes such school closures might happen			0
but @entity35 spokeswoman @entity231 called @entity209 ' claim " false , " asserting that union leaders said a few days ago that 100 schools would close , and " i 'm sure it 'll be another number tomorrow			0
" " all ms. @entity193 is trying to do is distract away from the fact that she and her leadership are using our kids as pawns in this process , " @entity231 wrote in an e-mail			0
another point of contention involves the teacher evaluation system , @entity209 said			0
the tentative contract would change it for the first time since 1967 , taking into account " student growth ( for the ) first time , " according to the school system			2
and teachers who are rated as " unsatisfactory and developing " could potentially be laid off			2
principals would keep " full authority " to hire teachers , and the school system will now have hiring standards for those with credentials beyond a teacher certification			2
in addition , " highly rated teachers " who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can " follow their students to the consolidated school , " according to a summary of the proposed contract from @entity35			2
this contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school - age students , 10 more " instructional days " each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system , as opposed to the two schedules now in place , depending on the school			0
the pay structure would change with a 3 % pay hike for the first year of the contract , 2 % for the second year and 2 % for the third year			2
if a trigger extends the contract to four years , teachers will get a 3 % pay increase			0
@entity18 members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days , health insurance contribution rates would be frozen , and the " enhanced pension program " would be eliminated			0
as is , the median base salary for teachers in the @entity0 public schools in 2011 was $ 67,974 , according to the system 's annual financial report			1
for high school athletes , strike could put scholarships on the line @entity1 's @entity300 reported from @entity0 and @entity301 from @entity302			1
@entity1 's @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 also contributed to this report .			0
