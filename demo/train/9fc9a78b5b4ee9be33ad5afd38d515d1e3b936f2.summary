outgoing @entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 , who said just a few weeks ago that @entity5 @entity4 candidate @entity3 was " wrong for the state of @entity2 , " has changed his tune			1
@entity0 , who was an ardent supporter of @entity1 congressman @entity7 in the race to succeed him , sees promise in @entity3 as she prepares to represent the @entity2 for the next six years			1
" i think she has the potential to be one , yes , " @entity0 told reporters in typical " @entity2 nice " fashion on @entity13 , when asked if @entity3 would be a good senator			1
they all have the potential when they come here			0
i think maybe some of the statements she 's made in the past -- i do n't know -- you know people grow , people grow into jobs			0
i 'll give her the benefit of the doubt			0
" the senator got into hot water while campaigning against her when he compared @entity3 's looks to @entity33 as the race came to a close , though he 's apparently shaken off the results			1
" obviously i was disappointed that @entity7 did n't get elected			0
fine guy , great congressman , but hey , that 's the breaks of elections , right ? " he said			0
@entity3 beat @entity7 by eight points in the midterms earlier this month			2
her win was a key seat @entity5 needed to take the majority in the upper chamber			2
@entity0 did reach out to @entity3 on election night to congratulate her for running a " great campaign " but did n't offer any other details			2
asked for advice he would give @entity3 as he concludes his 40 - year career in @entity55 , @entity0 said " if you want to be a good senator , when you come here , forget about the headlines , learn the rules , try to get on good committees , and think about the long term -- about what you can do for your state , for @entity2 , in the long term because things do n't happen overnight around here			1
you got ta start thinking about what you want to do that may take you four or five or six years or even beyond to get accomplished			0
