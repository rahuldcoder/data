@entity0 wanted to be in the movies ? you may get a chance soon , thanks to the burgeoning world of virtual reality and a film industry keen on exploring it			1
major movie studios like @entity11 , the influential @entity12 and @entity13 , @entity15 's $ 2 billion bet on the future of virtual reality , are just some of the players working to make you believe you 're fighting in the @entity18 or shooting through space with the @entity20			1
from @entity23 to surround sound to @entity25 to high projector frame rates , the history of film has been built on technology designed to make audiences feel more a part of the movie they 're watching			0
in virtual reality , which uses 360 - degree computer simulations to create the illusion of reality , some think they 've found the greatest leap yet in that direction			1
" the visceral impact of the format is simply too powerful to not to want to touch , " said @entity37 , senior programmer at the @entity12			1
@entity37 is curator of @entity40 , an initiative at @entity12 devoted to supporting filmmakers who are pushing the boundaries of art and technology			1
of @entity40 's 13 installations at next month 's festival , nine will feature virtual reality			1
they 'll range from " @entity54 , " a feature that puts the viewer in a city being attacked by monsters , to " @entity50 , " which will explore the potential for @entity52 in documentary storytelling			0
" i think the show this year speaks powerfully to how @entity52 is being embraced by big studios and independent filmmakers and artists alike , " @entity37 said			2
one of those big studios is @entity11			1
" @entity69 , " starring @entity67 and in theaters now , has been developed into a three - minute virtual experience in which the viewer joins @entity67 's character hiking the @entity68			2
that demo , developed along with @entity13 and @entity72 , will be shown this month at both @entity12 and the @entity74 consumer - electronics show in @entity75			2
@entity76 partnered with @entity13 this year on a similar short " experience " promoting " @entity78 , " in which the viewer is put into the shoes of a @entity82 's @entity81 member facing an enemy attack			0
it 's a new frontier for @entity13 , which set out to make its @entity85 headset a tool for video games			0
now , the company seeks to change everything about how we watch movies			2
" at some point , @entity52 is going to eliminate the need to go to a physical place and see a big screen , " @entity13 ceo @entity92 said			0
" it can be even richer than the @entity99 experience in a theater , because it can be 360 and all around you			0
" of course , that sort of mass - market shift is n't going to happen overnight			0
for one thing , @entity13 and other major virtual - reality players like @entity107 's @entity106 are n't even on store shelves			1
once they are , they 'll have to avoid the curse of other failed " next big things , " like @entity25 televisions			0
but @entity37 , and others like her , say it could happen			0
" only time will tell how consumers will take to wearing goggles to access their visual entertainment , " she said			0
" but if adaptation looks anything like the way consumers took to wearing earbuds to listen to music , or @entity129 devices to communicate on their phones , it becomes clear how very powerful a movement on our media landscape virtual reality can become			1
