@entity0 -- ok , so @entity3 president @entity2 and @entity6 prime minister @entity5 's brief summit featured all the enthusiasm of two unhappy schoolboys forced to make up after a schoolyard dust - up			1
in stark contrast , the meeting between @entity12 president @entity11 and @entity2 was all smiles and banter			1
but even if they remain reluctant reconcilers , @entity5 and @entity2 have started the process of mending fences			1
while that " want to be anywhere else " look in their press photo sparked skepticism about the potential for any improvement in relations , the fact they met at all exceeded expectations			1
@entity2 went far beyond the call of obligatory hospitality as @entity34 host in agreeing to a meeting that @entity5 has been requesting for almost two years			1
agreed to disagree this face time was facilitated by a joint @entity37 released last friday in which the two sides agreed to disagree and extended each other a ladder to climb down from their uncompromising positions			2
the statement is a diplomatic papering over of very real differences over a range of issues extending from history to territorial sovereignty			1
it is thus predictably ambiguous and more about face - saving than substance			2
it says something about the miserable state of @entity55 relations that it took this long to hammer out mutually acceptable language that seems to put the nations closer to the status quo ante when @entity60 nationalized the @entity61 in september 2012 and sent relations into a tailspin			2
since then there have been incidents of saber rattling , radar locking , jet scrambles , incursions by flotillas of trawlers , and @entity73 's sudden declaration of an @entity74			0
the escalating tensions led to speculation about the possibility of a grave miscalculation at sea or in the air that could provoke war			2
a hundred years after @entity83 , more than a few pundits have openly wondered whether it was @entity85 vu all over again -- two powers bound by such strong economic relations , making the thought of war so unlikely that they might sleepwalk towards the abyss			1
cooler heads the @entity34 meeting is the " cooler heads prevail " scenario			2
both leaders have come to the conclusion that it 's time to be pragmatic and try to work on the various problems that divide the leading @entity55 economies			0
nobody can accuse @entity2 or @entity5 of pandering to public opinion , although the frostiness on display may have appeased hardliners in both countries			1
more than 90 % of @entity3 and @entity6 have a negative opinion of each other , with the @entity6 recently surging ahead in the animosity sweepstakes			1
the media has played a key role in this			0
anti-chinese sentiment in newspapers and on television in @entity60 is amplified on the internet where armchair nationalists spew their vitriol			0
in @entity3 , wartime depredations by the @entity6 are endlessly dramatized , reminding audiences about who the enemy is			1
i met students in @entity123 and @entity124 who had a wildly warped understanding of @entity6 attitudes towards history , assuming that extremist views are the norm			1
they frequently reminded me that they hate @entity60 , but when i asked these students if they would like to study in @entity60 if offered a scholarship , an overwhelming majority told me yes			0
one suspects that deft public diplomacy can rapidly shift public opinion in both nations			0
a charm offensive , high level exchanges and a shift in the tenor of media reporting could work wonders			0
@entity2 's recently announced " @entity147 " probably does n't apply to @entity6 relations but monday 's brief summit could generate some positive momentum in a relationship that has deteriorated badly in the past few years			1
self - righteous nationalism both leaders have engaged in counterproductive grandstanding and gestures , embracing a masochistic and self - righteous nationalism that has undermined national interests			0
but hopefully both men understand that there is too much at stake to continue along this path			0
economic relations are the ties that bind , and both nations need each other to maximize their growth potential			2
to some extent economic ties have been insulated from diplomatic rows and political animus , but there are dispiriting signs that a new generation has come to age in both nations that bear the scars of angry antagonism			0
@entity2 and @entity5 have launched a very fragile process that could easily be derailed or flounder for a lack of political support or a public backlash			1
it is essential that both sides keep the rhetoric dialed down and shift hot button issues on to the backburner where they can simmer			0
they also need to move forward with crisis management protocols and mechanisms			0
they have broken the ice , but it is difficult to anticipate tangible results on divisive issues anytime soon			0
but to the extent that substance is sacrificed to optics , any thaw will remain limited			0
while expectations are thus muted , and progress may be slow and fitful , talking is better than some of the alternatives			2
opinion : @entity6 @entity5 scores another own goal on history			1

@entity3 president @entity2 held talks with @entity6 prime minister @entity5
their meeting was frosty but it was progress , says @entity210
relations have been severely strained between the two countries in recent years
at the heart of the tensions is a *bitter* territorial dispute
