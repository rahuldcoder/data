in rankings released on monday , @entity19 climbed to fourth after his victory at the @entity31 on sunday , and despite @entity21 slipping to fifth he is hoping home advantage can inspire him in @entity8			1
he told his website : " it 's an incredible atmosphere , a huge arena and it 's one of the biggest competitions in tennis behind the @entity38 , so i 'm really looking forward to it			2
" the last couple of weeks were n't as good as i 'd have liked , although i actually won my first doubles competition with my brother , which was cool , but playing in front of a home crowd is always great			2
it would be a big one psychologically to win , so i 'll give it my best shot			0
" @entity15 has also targeted victory at the @entity7 after his surprising defeat at the semifinal stage in @entity52 by @entity53			1
but @entity15 has an excellent record at the season finale with 29 wins and seven defeats since his first appearance in 2002			1
i think i have good chances maybe in @entity8 for winning , " @entity15 told the @entity60 's official website			1
" i feel good physically			0
in a way it is a relief that i was able to finish the tournament [ in @entity52 ] in good physical health			2
" i 'm fresh mentally , too			0
this is the most important thing			0
victories are important , but when you 're not fit and when you 're injured , it 's bad			0
so i think i 'm going to recover quite fast after that loss			0
" it was not a bad match [ against @entity73 ]			0
i 'm happy with my performance			0

i 'm going to prepare for @entity8			2
