-- be forewarned , @entity1 is seductive			1
traditions are strong and stress is a foreign word			1
i fell in love with the friendliest land this side of @entity9			1
it all happened in a @entity11			1
as you explore the lush @entity13 , you 'll see how the @entity1 got its name			1
gaeltachts are national parks for the traditional culture , where the government protects the old @entity1 ways			1
shaded green on many maps , these regions brighten the west coast of the @entity1			1
@entity11 means a place where @entity25 ( or @entity25 ) is spoken			1
but the @entity1 culture is more than just the language			1
you 'll find it tilling the rocky fields , singing in the pubs , and lingering in the pride of the small - town preschool that brags " @entity34			1
" the @entity13 -- green , rugged , and untouched -- is my favorite @entity11			1
while the big tour buses clog the neighboring ring of @entity39 before heading east to kiss the @entity40 , in @entity13 it still feels like the fish and the farm actually matter			1
fishing boats still sail from @entity44 , and a nostalgic whiff of peat scents its nighttime air , offering visitors an escape into pure @entity1			1
for 30 years my @entity1 dreams have been set here , on this sparse but lush peninsula where locals are fond of saying , " the next parish is @entity54			2
" of the peninsula 's 10,000 residents , 1,500 live in @entity57			2
its few streets , lined with ramshackle but gaily painted shops and pubs , run up from a rain - stung harbor , home to a friendly dolphin			2
you 'll see teenagers -- already working on ruddy beer - glow cheeks -- roll kegs up the streets and into the pubs in preparation for another night of music and craic ( fun conversation and atmosphere )			2
the @entity13 is worth exploring by bike or car			2
it 's 10 miles wide and runs 40 miles from @entity79 to @entity80			2
the top of its mountainous spine is @entity84 , at 3,130 feet , the second - tallest mountain in @entity1			2
while only tiny villages lie west of @entity57 , the peninsula is home to 500,000 sheep			2
the weather on this distant tip of @entity1 is often misty , foggy , and rainy			2
but do n't complain -- as locals will explain , there is no bad weather ... only inappropriate clothing			2
leaving @entity97 by car or bike , it becomes clear that the peninsula is an open - air museum			0
it 's littered with monuments reminding visitors that the town has been the choice of @entity108 settlers , @entity110 monks , @entity112 landlords , and @entity114 directors ( " @entity115 , " and " @entity116 " )			0
the @entity117 decorates its front yard not with a pink flamingo , but with an ancient pillar stone -- one of more than 2,000 stony pieces in the puzzle of prehistoric life here			0
near the red , two - room schoolhouse , a street sign warns @entity128 go @entity129 -- slow down			0
near the playground , students hide out in circular remains of a @entity134 ring fort			0
in 500 b.c. it was a petty @entity137 chieftain 's headquarters , a stone - and - earth stockade filled with little stone houses			0
many of these ring forts survived the centuries because of superstitious beliefs that they were " fairy forts			0
" the wet sod of @entity44 is soaked with medieval history			0
in the darkest depths of the @entity150 , when literate life almost died in @entity152 , peace - loving , bookwormish monks fled the chaos of barbarian raids on the continent			1
they sailed to this drizzly fringe of the known world and lived their monastic lives in lonely stone igloos or " beehive huts , " which you 'll see dotting the landscape			0
several groups of these mysterious huts , called clochans , line the road			0
built without mortar by seventh - century monks , these huts take you back			0
you 're all alone , surrounded by dank mist and the realization that it was these monks who kept literacy alive in @entity152			1
to give you an idea of their importance , @entity179 , who ruled much of @entity152 in the year 800 , imported @entity1 monks to be his scribes			1
rounding @entity80 , the point in @entity152 closest to @entity185 , the rugged coastline offers smashing views of deadly black - rock cliffs and the distant @entity188			1
the crashing surf races in like white horses , while longhaired sheep graze peacefully on the green hillside			0
study the highest fields , untouched since the planting of 1845 , when the potatoes never matured and rotted in the ground			0
the great famine of that year , through starvation or emigration , nearly halved @entity1 's population			0
because its endearing people have endured so much , @entity1 is called " @entity202			0
" take your time at the @entity204 , circa a.d. 800 , the sightseeing highlight of your peninsula tour			0
one of @entity1 's best - preserved early @entity210 churches , its shape is reminiscent of an upturned boat			0
its watertight dry - stone walls have sheltered travelers and pilgrims for 1,200 years			0
from the @entity204 , continue up the rugged one - lane road to the crest of the hill and then coast back to @entity57 -- hungry , thirsty , and ready for a pint			0
