abortion rates in the @entity1 are at their lowest in 40 years , according to a new report from the @entity3			1
in 2011 , the @entity1 abortion rate was 16.9 abortions per every 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 , the lowest it 's been since abortion was legalized in 1973			1
between 2008 and 2011 , the abortion rate fell 13 % , resuming the downward trend that had stalled between 2005 and 2008			1
abortion rates stall after decade - long decline " the decline in abortions coincided with a steep national drop in overall pregnancy and birth rates , " @entity12 , lead author of the study , said in a statement			1
" contraceptive use improved during this period			0
... moreover , the recent recession led many women and couples to want to avoid or delay pregnancy and childbearing			0
" the study , " @entity31 and @entity32 in the @entity1 , 2011 , " is available online and will be published in the march issue of the journal perspectives on @entity30			2
as @entity34 said , several variables affect abortion rates , including the economy , access to contraception and the availability of abortion services			1
the pregnancy rate is the lowest it has been in 12 years			1
it 's possible that since there were fewer overall pregnancies , there were also fewer unintended pregnancies during this time period			0
both could be attributed to an uptick in more effective contraception use , the study authors say			0
@entity1 women having fewer children previous studies have shown that offering free contraception to women may prevent abortions			1
longer - term methods , such as intrauterine devices , are as much as 20 times more effective at preventing unintended pregnancies than methods that require constant action , such as the birth control pill or vaginal ring			0
" access to a range of birth control methods is playing an important role in reducing unintended pregnancy and decreasing the need for abortion , " @entity64 , president of @entity65 , said in a statement			2
" this report comes just as some politicians and corporations are trying to make it harder for women to get birth control by chipping away at the historic benefit in the @entity81 that requires insurance plans to cover birth control without a copay			0
" women 's access to certain types of abortion providers also matters , the study authors say			2
in 2011 , abortion clinics represented just 19 % of facilities offering abortion services			1
yet clinics performed approximately 63 % of the procedures			0
the researchers concluded that " the number of clinics in particular may be a more important indicator of access than the total number of providers			0
" the total number of abortion providers declined 4 % between 2008 and 2011 , according to the study			1
the number of clinics declined 1 % nationwide , with much higher rates of decline in @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 , which each lost one clinic			2
although one clinic closure may seem insignificant , it may have contributed to the larger - than - average decline in the abortion rates in @entity109 and @entity110 , the study authors say			1
study : ' @entity119 ' led to fewer teen births an estimated 239,400 early medication abortions were performed in 2011 , 20 % more than in 2008			1
the vast majority -- 98 % -- were done using @entity123 , more commonly known as @entity123			0
@entity123 was approved in 2000 in the @entity1			0
it is used to block the hormone progesterone in women who are up to nine weeks pregnant			0
" heavy promotion of @entity123 and chemical abortions has really had an impact , " @entity126 , director of education and research with the @entity128 , told @entity129 in 2011			1
" ( women ) would consider abortion when they might not consider it before			0
" @entity128 recently released its own report on " @entity137 in the @entity1 , " which states that more than " 3,000 unborn children are still killed every day			1
" the anti-abortion organization says the recent drop in the abortion rate can be attributed to legislative efforts at the state and federal levels			1
" @entity31 remains widely available			0
but after years of being told that abortion was ' the best choice ' or ' their only choice , ' women are learning that there are alternatives to abortion that affirm their lives and the lives of their children , " president @entity145 said in a statement			2
" the bottom line is simple : the right - to - life movement is succeeding because even after 41 years and more than 56 million abortions , the conscience of our nation knows that killing unborn children is wrong			1
" abortion fast facts between 2008 and 2010 , 44 laws related to abortion were implemented in 18 states , according to the report			2
most did not likely have an effect on the abortion rate , the study authors say , but a few may have			1
for example , a new law in @entity174 that requires a woman to attend an in - person counseling session 24 hours before an abortion may have attributed to the state 's 17 % decline			2
an additional 62 laws related to abortion were passed in 2011			2
most did not go into effect until october , the study authors say , so it 's unlikely they had an effect on the report 's numbers			0
however , they may contribute to a change in abortion rates in the future			1
" over the past three years , we have seen an unparalleled attack on abortion rights at the state level , and these new restrictions are making it harder for women to access services and for providers to keep clinic doors open , " @entity192 , state issues manager at @entity193 , said in a press release			2
" as we monitor trends in abortion going forward , it is critical that we also monitor whether these state restrictions are preventing women who need abortion services from accessing them			0
" opinion : let 's get real about abortions the @entity3 study does have its limitations			0
the study authors were unable to get in touch with every abortion provider , and some providing early medication abortions may have been missed			0
" as welcome as news of this decline is , more information is needed , " said @entity220 , president of the @entity221			0
" the @entity193 data is based on completely voluntary reporting by abortion providers			0
until we have consistent reporting requirements , inclusive of states with high abortion rates and gathered by publicly accountable bodies , we can not begin to paint a complete picture of @entity1 abortion trends			1

abortion rates are at their lowest since 1973 when it was legalized
between 2008 and 2011 , the abortion rate fell 13 %
