-- president @entity2 's war drums continue to beat , but an offhand comment from secretary of state @entity4 has set in motion a diplomatic effort by @entity7 -- seized on at the @entity8 -- to ward off a @entity10 strike on @entity11 in favor of mediation			1
what @entity4 said was that @entity11 president @entity14 could prevent a strike if he " could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week			2
" @entity4 added that @entity11 would not be willing to do this			0
@entity7 has latched on to the proposal , and @entity11 says it is taking the idea seriously			2
the view is that @entity4 's comment is either an accidental out for a president hemmed in by his own red line , or a momentum - sucking goof that may have erased any chance @entity2 had to engage in a military strike without broader international approval			1
will @entity7 's proposal delay an @entity2 strike ? and how can @entity2 sway @entity10 to support military action ? with his approval ratings on all fronts tanking , his prime - time televised address tuesday night will be crucial			1
it 'll be the administration 's closing argument after a week of courting lawmakers			0
here are five things to look for today			0
what @entity2 says in his speech the president will still make the case that @entity49 must authorize military force in @entity11 , a senior administration official told @entity0			1
this , despite the fact that @entity2 believes @entity4 's offhand offer for @entity11 to turn over its chemical weapons could bear fruit now that @entity7 and the @entity8 have jumped aboard			1
the link between the two ? the administration argues that the offer to turn over chemical weapons would n't be on the table if not for the threat of force			2
a senior administration official told @entity0 that @entity4 's not in trouble with the president for the comment , but does admit that it was off the cuff while restating administration policy			1
bottom line : it was n't inconsistent with what was happening behind the scenes , according to the official			0
to make his case for a military strike , the president will lay out what happened in the chemical weapons attack in @entity11 on august 21 , and why it 's in @entity10 's interest to act			1
he 'll argue that the @entity10 ca n't let this kind of attack go unanswered , and he 'll tell us how he sees it affecting the safety of @entity10 troops			1
and perhaps the toughest one of all , he 'll tell a nation weary from more than a decade of war why @entity11 is n't @entity90 or @entity91			2
whether @entity7 's diplomatic volley has knocked the steam out of a strike the @entity95 is n't acting like it has			1
if anything , the lobbying on @entity97 is intensifying ahead of the president 's address			2
it all starts with @entity2 , who will go to @entity104 on tuesday to make his case to @entity106 , a @entity102 leadership aide told @entity0			1
making sure to hit both sides of the aisle , the president also will attend the @entity102 @entity108 lunch , a @entity102 @entity108 aide said			1
the @entity113 hosts three of the administration 's big guns beginning tuesday morning : @entity4 , defense secretary @entity116 and gen. @entity117 , chairman of the @entity118			0
all of them will get important face time with the influential committee			0
although no longer a member of the administration , former secretary of state @entity122 will speak on @entity11 at the @entity125 in @entity126 on tuesday evening , just ahead of the president 's national address			2
whether the lobbying efforts pay off in votes for the time being , the tide is against the @entity95			1
on monday , six senators notched their votes in the " no " column , with just one , democrat @entity136 , saying she would favor military intervention against @entity11			2
in the @entity95 , chalk up 13 new " no " votes			1
that brings the total of " no " votes to 29 in the @entity102 and 161 in the @entity95			1
still , there are a lot of undecided members -- 46 in the @entity102 and at least 229 in the @entity95			1
the numbers could still work out for the president			0
senate majority leader @entity147 postponed a procedural vote that had been scheduled for wednesday			0
the @entity102 's in no hurry to vote on @entity11			1
if @entity2 fares better in the court of public opinion the president 's approval rating on foreign policy is at an all - time low of 40 % , a steady slide from 54 % in january , according to a @entity0 / @entity158 survey			1
just three in 10 approve of how he 's handling @entity11			0
the public is split right down the middle on whether @entity2 is a strong leader , whether he is honest and trustworthy , and whether he inspires confidence			2
then there 's the whole " war weariness " issue in play			1
six in 10 say the war in @entity90 was a mistake , and 50 % say the same thing about @entity91			0
three - quarters say the @entity10 does n't need to be the " world policeman			2
" also hurting the president 's cause , more than seven in 10 say a strike would not achieve significant goals for the @entity10 , and a similar amount say it 's not in the national interest for the country to get involved in @entity11 's civil war , a separate @entity0 / @entity158 poll shows			1
the sentiments come despite survey results that show 80 % of @entity10 believe @entity14 's regime gassed its own people			2
how the international community reacts the next move appears to be @entity7 's in this diplomatic chess match			1
can foreign minister @entity189 deliver on the offer to have @entity11 hand its chemical arsenal over to international control , or is it just an effort to buy time for the @entity14 regime ? @entity189 said tuesday that @entity7 's working on a " workable , clear , specific plan " that it 'll present soon			1
the @entity95 is willing to listen and , perhaps , wait a bit -- but not too long			2
" it 's certainly a positive development when the @entity7 and @entity11 both make gestures towards dealing with these chemical weapons , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity199 on monday			1
but he said the threat of @entity10 force would remain			2
" we do n't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now			0
" @entity8 @entity212 ban ki - moon is listening , too			0
he 's considering asking the @entity213 to demand the @entity11 government immediately hand over its chemical weapons to be destroyed			0
@entity216 and @entity217 also say they like what they 're hearing about a diplomatic solution			0
but , the @entity216 foreign minister said , the @entity213 needs to oversee the process , which should start immediately , and the plan should n't let anyone off the hook for ordering a chemical attack			0
@entity216 foreign minister @entity228 said tuesday that @entity216 is proceeding with caution			0
" we take note of this new position with interest but also precaution , " he said			0
" we do not want it to be used as a maneuver for diversion			0
" what the @entity216 want to see is for @entity11 to be transparent about its chemical weapons program and to put it under international control			0
@entity216 also wants the perpetrators of the deadly chemical weapons attack tried before the international justice system , @entity228 said			0
@entity244 , a longtime @entity11 ally , welcomes the @entity7 initiative " to stop militarism in the region			0
" @entity249 , also an ally of @entity11 , says it welcomes and supports the proposal			0
the opposition @entity252 says @entity7 's proposal is nothing more than a stalling tactic			1
" here we go again with the regime trying to buy more time in order to keep on the daily slaughter against our innocent civilians and to fool the world , " said @entity256 , a spokesman for the group			0
@entity0 's @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0

the president will still make the case that @entity49 must authorize military force
the @entity95 does n't think @entity7 's diplomacy has made a strike *impossible*
more " no " votes have popped up , but a lot of @entity95 and @entity102 members are undecided
@entity2 's approval rating on foreign policy is down , and a poll shows @entity10 war weariness
