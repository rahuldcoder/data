-- tourist traps -- overcrowded , over-hyped and , of course , overpriced			0
why ? because however one bad experience may make us feel about them , they 're awesome			0
that 's why they get overcrowded in the first place			1
that 's why , as @entity13 supposedly once said of popular @entity15 restaurant @entity16 's : " nobody goes there anymore			1
" professional globetrotter @entity18 perhaps sums it up best when he says , " i had a horrible time at the @entity22 , but i 'd go back and recommend people go because ... they 're the @entity22			0
some places you just have to suck it up and go visit			0
" here are eight over-popular places that are well worth a visit anyway -- and a few tips for avoiding the scrum , if you really have to			1
share your picks for most - worth - it tourist traps in the comments			1
@entity36 ( @entity37 , @entity38 ) it 's one of @entity38 's most popular sights , attracting 3 million visitors a year -- which automatically puts it on many tourist 's verboten list			1
more fool them : they 're missing a @entity48 that really lives up to the hype			0
at sunrise or sunset the crowds are slimmest and the building is at its most photogenic			1
travel writer @entity54 picked the dawn hours of a rainy day for her visit , when most tourists would stay in bed			0
@entity59 of the @entity60 took a different approach			0
" i went on a sunny day and still had a wonderful visit , " says @entity60			0
" the site is just as popular with @entity38 tourists , so it was fun to interact with the families			0
the @entity67 ( @entity68 , @entity69 ) ruggedly modern @entity68 may be a culture shock to those expecting white marble and togas at every turn , but for many the most jarring experience awaits at the ticket barriers to the @entity78 , complete with security guards and a sea of visitors			1
the climb up is hot and crowded -- but at the top , you 'll see why a million people do this every year			0
this is @entity68 culture refined and placed on a pedestal 150 meters high -- in every sense , it 's the heart of @entity68 and maybe even of @entity69			1
the country 's monuments have endured thousands of years of warfare , stone theft , punishing heat and , in one dramatic incident , an exploding ammo dump -- but they 're still here			1
be inspired by that , grit your teeth and brave those crowds			1
alternately ... if you 're looking for the best view in the city , head northeast and climb @entity106			0
from its peak ( at 277 meters , the highest point in the city ) , you 'll be looking down onto the @entity78 , and the rest of the view will punch the breath out of you			0
@entity113 ( @entity114 ) canned sardines would gloat if they ever saw the twisted , conjoined bodies scrapping for pockets of air during rush hour on @entity113 's tube service			1
during tourist season , it can get spectacularly horrible			0
there are tricks and shortcuts to avoid bottlenecks , including going up to street level and walking to the next station			0
alternative tube maps have become an art form ( like the incredible @entity132 map ) and the network 's history is fascinating			1
if you need an excuse to explore , there 's the @entity138 -- visiting all 270 stations in 24 hours			1
@entity140 ( @entity141 ) online reviews of @entity140 can be damning : " meh , lots of drunk backpackers , tacky , noisy and crowded			0
" dubbed by @entity146 as the place to disappear , it 's usually raucous and requires a particular mindset to enjoy			2
it 's a tourist trap -- but not an unwelcome one , according to the average review on @entity152			2
people visit @entity140 because it 's thrillingly chaotic -- the noise and the crowds are the price of that excitement			1
they 're usually a bargain			0
alternately ... too much chaos for you ? look to the surrounding streets			0
while food on @entity140 itself has a reputation for being underwhelming and overpriced , writer @entity162 found a wealth of @entity168 and @entity169 food nearby , including the well - reviewed @entity170 , the " cheapest and best hummus i 've found in town			0
@entity173 ( @entity174 ) acting as @entity174 's own @entity78 is the basilica of the @entity176 of @entity174 , better known as @entity173 , high above the city on the hill of @entity179			2
consecrated less than a century ago , it 's the city 's must - see symbol of unity and renewed confidence -- and yet the approach to it is plagued with @entity174 's worst tourist scams , including the @entity187			2
" most visitors take the same route , " says travel blogger @entity188			2
" they get off at the @entity194 metro stop , walk through the gauntlet of tacky souvenir shops on @entity197 , take the funicular up to @entity173 , walk to the @entity199 to see the artists selling their original paintings and finally walk back down the hill to see the underwhelming @entity203			0
" venture outside these few areas and you 'll find a whole different world of quintessential @entity174 cafes , tree - lined streets , private gardens , hidden alleyways and boulangeries that most tourists never see			0
@entity213 ( @entity114 ) ah , @entity213			0
these days you 're unlikely to step between the stones unless you 're allowed special access ( say , you 're @entity216 )			2
most visitors have to walk around the outside -- and yet that 's enough			1
it 's the crowning monument in a staggeringly archaeology - rich landscape			2
it 's also changing dramatically			2
a new Â £ 27 million ( $ 45 million ) visitor center opened in december 2013 , and as with many new arrivals it 's suffered a few teething problems			2
this is the most famous prehistoric monument in @entity230 , perhaps in the world -- and we still do n't know what it was for			2
alternately ... twenty miles to the north , @entity236 's stone circles has no admission fee and gets a quarter of the annual visitors			1
the stone circles are a short walk from @entity242 and other stunning prehistoric monuments			0
@entity244 ( @entity245 ) it 's the most famous sight in @entity247 , it 's stunningly beautiful and it has a remarkable history			1
of course you need to go			0
even if the area around the 98 - foot - tall statue is almost always heaving with visitors			1
" most of the photos you 'll have seen are likely to have been taken by photographers in helicopters who can find the space they need for the shot without the crowds , " says travel photographer @entity253			2
" if you want to avoid the crush , go on a weekday rather than the weekend and perhaps pick a day that is n't totally clear			1
" the morning is better for photos of the statue , as the light is on him , whilst the afternoon and evening offers better light across @entity245			1
@entity274 ( @entity275 ) if @entity277 's @entity276 is your destination this year , do n't waste your visit on a whistle - stop trip to the edge			1
that 's how most people experience it , and it 's a poor way to do this 17 - million - year - old landmark justice			1
to avoid the beaten track do as the wisest local guides suggest -- book a few days and venture below the rim -- best to go out of season , as the canyon floor can be unbearably hot ( @entity294 ) during summer .			2

@entity245 's most famous landmark , @entity244 , is usually heaving with visitors . so what ?
it 's worth booking a couple days at the @entity274 rather than *peering* over the edge and leaving
choosing a weekday over weekend or early morning over midday can spare you crowds at big attractions
