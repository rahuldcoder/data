-- on monday afternoon , the @entity1 -- print journalism 's highest honors -- were announced			1
among the names not on the list : the @entity5			1
it was n't for lack of trying			2
the bastion of supermarket check - out lanes , home of @entity11 and @entity12 , was being considered for its work breaking the @entity15 sex scandal , a story it followed when much of the so - called " mainstream media " was looking the other way			1
the weekly paper , which has a paid circulation of just under 800,000 , was entered in two categories -- investigative reporting and national news reporting -- but apparently fell short			2
( the winners were the @entity25 with @entity26 ; and the staff of the @entity28 , respectively			2
) enquirer executive editor @entity29 told @entity0 last week that winning would have been an honor , and he liked hearing the @entity5 's name mentioned among the titans of the mainstream media			1
" it helps our credibility around the world , " says @entity29			2
" @entity47 " may not be the first word associated with the @entity5 -- but it has had some surprising journalistic scoops in years past , including the @entity42 sex scandal and a number of leads during the @entity46 trial			1
with the @entity15 story , it had some support from mainstream media observers			1
" had the @entity5 not exercised a very tenacious reporting on this -- which we respect in the journalism world , right ? -- would we not have known that this scandal was occurring ? " said @entity52 , director of the school of journalism at the @entity55			1
" would @entity15 perhaps have been nominated [ for president ] ? ... i mean , there 's no question the course of history would have been different			1
" but the @entity5 's reputation is as a scandal sheet that revels in humanity 's foibles			1
never mind that such publications have been a mainstay of journalism for more than a century , says @entity73 , a cultural studies professor at the @entity74			0
indeed , the new respect for the @entity5 is another sign that , in the internet age , the old divisions between " serious " news and tabloid - style coverage have broken down , @entity75 says			1
@entity29 , the @entity5 's executive editor , worked for mainstream outlets , including the @entity83 , before moving towards tabloid journalism			1
" even most [ mainstream news organization ] @entity86 homepages will have all the gossip , " @entity75 says			0
" it makes us wonder about the validity of categorization			0
" the @entity5 has many forebears , but if it wins , it may want to tip a fedora to @entity94 , the " most scandalous scandal magazine " of its time , in @entity98 's wonderfully emphatic words			1
founded in 1952 , the pulp magazine was the brainchild of @entity101 , a dapper , high - living @entity102 - based publisher who made some money with 1940s soft - core girlie magazines such as @entity105 and @entity106			2
pairing with editor @entity107 , who had made the journey from muckraking communist to muckraking anti-communist , @entity101 relied on a formula of @entity112 scandal , redbaiting exposes and occasional investigative pieces to make @entity94 , at a quarter a throw , the top newsstand seller of its time			2
it was the first of a postwar breed of magazines to take advantage of the breakdown of the @entity112 studio system which , with back - scratching and arm - twisting , had protected stars ' private lives from prying columnists			0
@entity127 were also showing a more open interest in gossip			0
as @entity135 once said , " everybody reads it , but they say the cook brought it into the house			0
" with its lurid red - and - yellow covers and its colorful , often alliterative prose , @entity94 published brazen stories that revealed stars ' homosexuality , tawdry pasts and domestic battles -- usually carefully vetted and written to protect against lawsuits			0
it was a side of celebrities @entity127 had seldom seen , and it contrasted with the airbrushed images presented by more mainstream publications : the same month @entity148 published a glowing profile of " @entity150 " stars @entity152 and @entity153 , @entity94 headlined a story , " does @entity156 ? " and showcased an old @entity153 affair			0
" @entity94 came out and said , ' this is what life 's really like , ' " says @entity160 , author of the new book " @entity162 : the @entity163			2
" @entity101 got away with it , @entity160 said , because he did n't care what the moguls thought			0
" @entity101 was not obligated to @entity112			0
his business model was n't dependent on advertising			2
" @entity94 's rise earned enemies as quickly as profits , and its fall came fast and hard			2
@entity107 left , later to die in a brutal 1958 murder - suicide that would have made prime @entity94 fodder , had the magazine not been faltering			2
the year before , @entity94 got careless on a story about @entity177			0
the actress sued for libel and won			0
with many of its sources exposed , @entity94 's information pipeline dried up and it soon dropped the celebrity exposes			1
@entity101 sold it in mid- 1958 ; its spark was gone			0
but its impact , said @entity160 , lives on as the forerunner of today 's gossip blogs , supermarket tabloids and celebrity glossies -- including the @entity5			1
indeed , former enquirer editor @entity190 , who guided the publication from the ' 60s well into the ' 90s , riffs on @entity5 firsts with the brio of a character out of " @entity196			1
" his own book , 2004 's " @entity198 , " describes searching through @entity200 's garbage ( which revealed allegedly secret memos ) , getting a photo of @entity11 in his coffin ( it became the cover of the @entity5 's best - selling issue ) and covering the " @entity206 " / " dynasty " tv battle			1
it 's the kind of coverage that 's harder to do nowadays , said @entity190 , lamenting the financial squeeze that 's hit media companies			1
" i had the highest - paid , best investigative reporters ever in @entity127 , " he said in his engaging @entity214 brogue			0
" i could hire a private jet and put 40 reporters on a major story			0
" in those days -- the late ' 70s and early ' 80s -- the paper routinely sold more than 5 million copies weekly			2
indeed , @entity29 faces a more competitive media landscape			2
along with all the celebrity glossies and supermarket tabloids , there are a plethora of tv shows , web sites and blogs treading on his territory			1
but he said the @entity5 is holding its own , thanks to such stories as the @entity15 affair , the @entity236 scandal and the @entity238 story			1
and though more mainstream publications scoff at the @entity5 's " checkbook journalism " and in - your - face headlines , those same publications are doing things they might not have considered 10 years ago			1
media watcher and former journalist @entity245 , who said last week that the @entity5 deserved the @entity247 , points out that the @entity248 has hired a raft of bloggers who " say the craziest but most germane things about our culture			1
" " i think more people are going to use the @entity255 to get those pajama - clad journalists			0
they 'll aggregate them instead of compete with them , " he said			0
" sometimes i think to myself that maybe we 're too caught up in what is an opinion and what is fact			0
maybe what people want is the mix. " not to mention a mix of styles : gossip and hard news , celebrities and human interest , investigative exposes and mundane process pieces			0
not all of it will qualify for a @entity247 , but maybe that is n't the point , said @entity190			0
" we did n't want to be like other papers , " he said of his @entity5 days			1
" why do [ journalists ] care what other journalists think ? there was only one thing i wanted to do , and that was to get stories to sell papers			0
" somewhere , @entity101 is smiling			0
@entity289 contributed to this story .			0

the @entity5 was considered for a @entity1 for @entity15 coverage
enquirer better known for roots as a celebrity supermarket paper , scandal sheet
roots of it and others can be most directly traced to 1950s magazine confidential
@entity5 's new respect *illustrative* of changes in media business
