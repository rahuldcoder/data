-- unfancied @entity1 inflicted the first big shock of the @entity3 by consigning @entity6 champions @entity4 to a surprise 1 - 0 defeat in @entity9			1
it is a nightmare start for @entity4 , which arrived in @entity11 ranked as the second best team in the world			2
it will surely now have to win its next two group games to avoid an embarrassing exit before the knockout stages			0
@entity19 ' 52nd minute strike for the @entity20 came completely against the run of play , and will hardly be remembered as one of the tournament 's finest , but despite pouring forward in the game 's dying stages @entity4 could not salvage a point			1
the @entity20 now share top spot in the group with @entity30 , which produced an impressive display to beat @entity32 1 - 0 in wednesday 's early kickoff			1
@entity34 grabbed the only goal of the game , bundling home a cross from @entity39 , but @entity30 could and should have scored more after squandering a host of chances			1
@entity1 1 - 0 @entity4 a spirited rearguard action earned @entity1 one of its most famous victories at the @entity3 as it held on for a 1 - 0 win over @entity4			1
coach @entity46 will have plenty of soul searching to do after @entity4 dominated possession but struggled to create any clear cut chances			1
in a labored opening half , it was @entity4 defender @entity53 who forced the first save of the match as he twisted free in the penalty area before having his shot smothered by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity59			1
@entity61 striker @entity60 was next to get a sight of goal as he drew @entity59 before curling a chip wide of the post but the @entity20 negotiated their way to the break without conceding			0
with the second half seven minutes old @entity1 shocked @entity4 by scoring with its first attack of note			1
@entity71 released @entity72 who took a tumble over the onrushing @entity76 , but as the ball squirmed loose @entity19 prodded it into an empty net			2
@entity4 responded by introducing @entity81 striker @entity80 but it was @entity60 who had the next chance , racing onto a through ball from @entity86 only to be thwarted by @entity59			2
then as @entity87 turned on the edge of the area the ball ran free to @entity86 , who struck the ball narrowly wide of the far post			0
@entity80 then blazed wide from just inside the area before @entity93 midfielder @entity92 crashed a venomous shot against the bar from 20 yards out			0
as the @entity97 launched numbers forward they left gaps at the back and @entity72 nearly put the game beyond their reach as he wriggled past @entity104 in the box before prodding a shot against the foot of the post			0
@entity80 blasted a volley over the bar in the closing stages but @entity1 duly held on to claim three points and register its first ever win over @entity4			1
@entity4 's defeat means it now has no margin for error in the next two games against @entity32 and @entity30			1
after the game @entity46 told @entity117 : " we tried to play			0
they played very far back and tried to counter-attack			0
we were playing to win and this victory has escaped us			0
we may not have shown our true personality as a team			0
" it 's not a good sign to start off in this way but we have an obligation to cope with that and face the next two games trying to win			0
that 'll be our goal for the next two matches			0
" of course , you can lose in football , but i feel we 'll try to get even			0
we must really give everything			0
it 's pointless standing there with our heads hanging low			0
the next matches will be good			0
" @entity30 1 - 0 @entity32 @entity30 kicked off its first @entity3 campaign in 12 years with a comfortable 1 - 0 victory against unfancied @entity32 on wednesday , but needed a fortuitous first - half goal to triumph in @entity11			1
the @entity146 , who qualified second from their region behind @entity149 , dominated the @entity151 opener in @entity152 against a 38th - ranked team who scraped the final place in the @entity157 zone			1
but for all its silky skills and intricate passing , coach @entity158 was left frustrated on the sidelines as @entity30 could not translate its possession into goals as @entity32 -- playing at soccer 's showpiece event for the first time since 1982 -- defended stubbornly			1
the breakthrough came in the 34th minute when @entity34 bundled the ball into the net after a low right - wing cross by @entity39			2
the forward claimed just his second international goal in 28 appearances , though television replays suggested the ball went in illegally off his arm after deflecting off a sliding @entity32 defender			2
the @entity178 had another slice of poor luck in the first minute after halftime when @entity182 was brought down by @entity183 on the edge of the penalty area -- but the referee ruled it was not a foul despite the @entity189 ' appeals for a spot - kick			0
@entity30 playmaker @entity191 should have made it 2 - 0 just after an hour , but screwed his shot wide after a superb burst through the defense had put him clear on goal			1
@entity197 then inexplicably stooped to head the ball straight at @entity32 goalkeeper @entity199 from close range when it seemed easier to score , having been set up by a well - worked free - kick			2
@entity30 had the ball in the net again with 15 minutes to play , but @entity204 was ruled offside after teammate @entity191 clearly used his hand to set him up -- for which he should have been booked by referee @entity207 of the @entity208			2
on tuesday , @entity32 became the first nation to select three brothers in a @entity3 squad , with striker @entity212 called up to replace the injured @entity213			1
he was an unused substitute against @entity30 along with the younger of the trio , @entity214 , while midfielder @entity215 started the game and was booked shortly before the only goal .			2

@entity1 inflict a shock defeat on one of the @entity3 *favorites* @entity4
@entity19 grabs the only goal in a match @entity4 dominated
@entity4 is now facing an *uphill* task to qualify from @entity151
@entity34 scores only goal as @entity30 beat @entity32 1 - 0 in @entity151 opener
