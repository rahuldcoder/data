-- there 's been plenty of talk about the gender pay gap in recent days after speculation that recently fired @entity7 executive editor @entity6 was let go after speaking up about possible pay disparity between her and the previous executive editor , @entity10			1
in response to that talk , the @entity7 publisher , in a lengthy statement over the weekend , said @entity6 's total " pay package , " which included stock and other compensation in addition to salary , was " comparable " to @entity10 's and was , in fact , more than 10 % higher during @entity6 's last year , and that her removal was due to her management of the newsroom , nothing else			2
until we hear @entity6 's side of the story , it remains unclear what role , if any , an alleged pay gap played in her fate			1
what is clear is how outraged women were hearing that the @entity7 ' first woman executive editor could be making less than the last male executive editor			2
it was another reminder , to many women , that the income gap is alive and well			2
but if one city gets its way , that disparity between what men and women earn will become a thing of the past			2
@entity47 has pledged to become the first city in the country to eliminate the gender pay gap			1
it 's certainly a lofty goal : how on @entity52 will @entity47 make it happen ? opinion : do n't believe the hype : in real world , women still make less than men on monday , at a @entity65 regional conference on working families in @entity47 , administration officials along with members of the @entity61 congressional delegation , including @entity63 sen. @entity62 , joined business leaders and academics , to tout the city 's ambitious plan and what it will take to succeed			1
the event is one of several this spring leading up to a summit with president @entity75 at the end of june at the @entity65			1
" what 's really significant is that @entity47 recognizes that this is n't just an issue of fairness and is n't just an issue of equity as a moral value , " said @entity77 , a member of the president 's @entity78 , in an interview			1
" this is about competitiveness and having a competitive advantage			2
" women make up about half the labor force but will soon represent more than half of the highly educated labor force , said @entity94 , who will be speaking at the @entity47 conference			1
" that 's why it becomes an issue of competitiveness			0
the amount of talent that is in that other half that you 're ignoring is relevant and when you have a lot of the talent in that other half , ignoring it is going to become even more costly over time , " said @entity94 , who is currently on leave from her position as associate professor of public policy and economics at the @entity110			0
making @entity47 the ' premier city for working women ' last year , then @entity47 mayor @entity117 pledged to make @entity47 the " premier city for working women			1
" he created a women 's @entity119 , made up of leaders in academia and the public and private sectors			0
@entity125 , executive director of the women and @entity127 at @entity128 , is a member of the council			0
" when you make a city good for women , you raise the economic profile of that city			2
you are going to retain talent , " said @entity125			0
women outnumber men in @entity47 at 52 % of the population , according to a report by the @entity141			1
the city also has the largest proportion of young women between the ages of 20 and 34 of any major city , and has a higher percentage of college educated women than any other metro area			2
and yet , the city has a significant pay gap , although it 's lower than the national average			1
in 2011 , working female residents of @entity47 earned 83 % of what male residents in @entity47 earned , according to the report			1
nationwide , women earn 77 cents for every dollar men make			0
@entity47 is asking companies to voluntarily sign a compact committing to take steps to reduce the wage gap			1
about 50 companies , including some of the city 's biggest employers such as @entity168 and @entity169 , have signed it			1
the council 's report includes 33 different " interventions " companies can take to close the wage gap , from evaluating why mothers and non-mothers leave their businesses to standardizing compensation including bonuses to actively recruiting women to executive level and board positions			1
" we 've made it easy , " said @entity125 , who was recognized in our recent @entity0 10 : visionary women special coverage for her work trying to eliminate the income disparity between men and women			2
" we 're not saying : ' go make it equal -- figure it out			0
' we 're saying : ' here 's a plan and a set of strategic goals			0
' " the approach , she hopes , can serve as a model for cities around the country and the world			0
just last month , @entity125 traveled to @entity205 to present what @entity47 is doing to the @entity207			1
" rather than a regulation , " said @entity125 , it 's a " nudge			0
" what happens when women negotiate for many women , taking steps themselves to close their own personal income gap makes them incredibly uncomfortable			1
according to an @entity216 survey last year of 1,500 women , only 35 % said they ever asked for a raise			0
that 's even more significant based on the finding that of those who were unhappy at work , 63 % said the number one reason was because they felt they were underpaid			0
there is a reason our discomfort is not unwarranted			0
according to @entity125 , the research shows that when women are given an offer and negotiate that offer , or when they are paid a certain amount and they want to negotiate their salary , people tend to want to work with them less			0
" women are expected to be relational and when they say , ' i think my value is @entity241 , ' people might say , ' hmmm , why are they asking ? i do n't feel so comfortable with that , ' and it usually causes social backlash , " said @entity125			0
whether or not @entity6 faced some backlash for confronting her superiors over her compensation and whether that contributed in even the slightest way to her firing , we 'll probably never know but , said @entity125 , it " fits the pattern			0
" read about @entity6 's commencement address monday @entity256 , a senior partner at the executive search firm , @entity259 / @entity258 , said there is a double standard when it comes to how men and women sit down and discussion compensation			2
she said the best advice for women is to keep track of their successes and then find the right way to make their case			0
" being able to sit down at the right time , at the right moment , to say ... ' how can we close this gap ? what do we need to do ? ' " you need to do it in a way that 's not threatening , " said @entity256			1
" there is an art to this			0
" opinion : was @entity6 fired because she is a woman ? what do you think it will take to eliminate the gender pay gap ? chime in in the comments or tell @entity291 on @entity292 or @entity293 on @entity294 .			1

@entity47 has pledged to become the first city to eliminate the gender pay gap
at @entity65 regional summit in @entity47 monday , the city will tout plans
so far , some 50 companies in @entity47 have signed a compact , committing to close the gap
