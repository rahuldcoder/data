the embattled head of the @entity1 blames faulty technology for what he called serious problems under investigation by @entity6 , the @entity7 and the @entity9 inspector general			1
@entity10 told @entity12 's @entity11 on thursday that he apologized to anyone who had their application for tax - exempt status held up by @entity1 targeting of political labels			1
" the improper criteria used to highlight organizations for investigation just by their name was a mistake , " @entity10 said			1
" i apologize to anybody who ever had their applications held up needlessly			0
everybody needs to be confident that the @entity1 is going to treat them fairly no matter who they are			2
republicans , @entity30 , whatever organization they belong to			0
so it 's a serious matter			0
" however , he maintained that evidence uncovered so far by six investigations found no involvement by the @entity37 , as alleged by some @entity29			2
in particular , @entity29 critics contend a hard drive crash that wiped out e-mails of the woman at the center of the controversy -- former @entity1 official @entity41 -- looked like a cover - up			1
when we uncovered it , we pursued evidence , " @entity10 said , adding that the agency also looked at other hard - drive failures in recent years			2
" i think we need to pull all this together , see what we know and proceed			0
" at the same time , he noted technology problems occurred regularly , with 2,000 hard drives failing so far this year at the agency , which has about 90,000 employees			0
@entity56 official : @entity1 did not follow the line congressional republicans pummeled @entity10 with questions and accusations this week , all but accusing him of perjury			1
but he hit back at committee hearings and in the @entity12 interview			2
" it 's not my intention at all to play games with the @entity6 , " he said , adding that " people need to feel comfortable that it 's not a politicized agency , that it treats people fairly whoever they are			0
" asked by @entity11 whether he regretted taking the job , @entity10 joked he should have read the fine print ahead of time			1
no regrets , he added , citing the need to fulfill an important public service			0
a government veteran , the 74 - year - old @entity10 is taking the brunt of congressional pressure after the agency admitted it lost thousands of e-mails wanted by lawmakers investigating the targeting scandal			2
rep. @entity85 , a @entity86 @entity29 , flat out questioned whether @entity10 was being truthful with @entity6 , and @entity88 , the @entity89 chairman , called him out for being evasive			1
on thursday , @entity10 repeated his belief that an independent prosecutor would be unnecessary and a waste of taxpayer dollars with the other investigations underway			1
@entity29 sen. @entity95 of @entity96 said thursday that attorney general @entity97 , a frequent target of @entity29 attacks , should be impeached for refusing to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the missing @entity41 e-mails			1
these e-mails have n't just been lost , " @entity95 said on the @entity104 floor			2
" these e-mails have been deleted , taped over and the hard drive physically destroyed , according to public news reports			0
" asked by @entity11 whether a criminal investigation was warranted , @entity10 replied : " i do n't think ... at this time there 's any evidence of that			1
" top @entity1 official beats back @entity29 barrage @entity41 , who ran the division that carried out the @entity1 targeting , resigned last year after the @entity9 's inspector general found those working under her used " inappropriate " criteria to scrutinize certain groups , particularly those with conservative political names			1
since then , she has refused to testify at hearings , invoking her constitutional right not to do so			0
earlier this month , the @entity1 told @entity6 that a 2011 crash of @entity41 's computer hard drive meant that e-mails until that point had been lost			1
the @entity1 targeting was first noticed by the agency after that time			2
@entity10 noted thursday that the agency had recovered 24,000 @entity41 e-mails by other means and was cooperating fully with all investigations of the matter			2
when @entity11 noted that taxpayers believe the @entity1 would never accept the excuse of a hard drive crash for filing an improper return , @entity10 responded that the agency tries to work with people to resolve the situation			1
" we historically , if a taxpayer has lost electronic records , have said if you have other indications and evidence of what went on , we 'll take that from you , " he said			0
" if you lose a document , it does n't mean you lose the argument			0
we actually work with taxpayers to say we 'll look at other evidence ... and if we can find any evidence to support your case -- and , in fact , if the circumstances support your case , we 'll support you and you wo n't have any problems			0
" on wednesday , a @entity29 congressman revealed @entity41 e-mails that asked whether the @entity1 should look into an invitation for @entity29 sen. @entity160 of @entity161 to appear at a seminar			1
the disclosure of the e-mail exchanges by @entity166 chairman @entity165 of @entity167 further inflamed @entity29 sentiment against @entity41			0
however , it was not clear from the e-mails whether @entity41 was referring to an audit of @entity160 personally or the group that invited him and was possibly offering to pay for his wife to attend			0
her lawyer said @entity41 acted appropriately , and @entity10 said thursday the intent was unclear			0
@entity30 accuse @entity37 @entity29 of politicizing the @entity1 investigation , noting that some liberal seeking tax exempt status also were also targeted by the agency			1
