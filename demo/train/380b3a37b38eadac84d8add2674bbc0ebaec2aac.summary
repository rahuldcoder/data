the two sides met ahead of a promised labor shutdown of the @entity1 oil industry			1
in solidarity with protesters , the oil union has threatened to stop production if the government does not reinstate subsidies that will return the cost of fuel to previous levels			1
a decision to halt production would affect global oil prices ; @entity1 is the world 's eighth - largest exporter			1
throngs of protesters have rallied to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies ended on january 1 , a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing			1
" this is not the first time the subsidy has been removed in @entity1			2
for two decades , every single government has done this , " said @entity40 , the nation 's finance minister			2
" there is a very short memory			0
it has always resulted in resistance and a strike and so on			2
" a deal had not been reached to avert the shutdown as talks stretched into early sunday			0

despite the strike suspension , the deadline to shut down oil production is still in effect unless the government and labor unions reach an agreement , he said			1
the protests -- dubbed " @entity79 " -- have galvanized the continent 's most populous nation			0
@entity1 accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty			2
