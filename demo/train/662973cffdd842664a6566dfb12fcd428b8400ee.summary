-- engines rev up sunday for the start of the 2013 @entity4 season with the 55th running of the @entity6 , stock car racing 's biggest event			1
but for one driver , the race is about more than a possible trip to victory lane			2
@entity13 is racing for @entity14			1
the events of december 14 left most of @entity16 stunned and clutching their children a little tighter			0
the loss of 20 children and six employees at the @entity24 , @entity25 , elementary school united people in grief across the globe , many of whom had an immediate desire to help			2
@entity4 president @entity30 was among those			2
he knew that his stock car racing family had to act			2
two - time @entity6 winner @entity13 said @entity30 called him up and said , " i 've got something i think we should do for the @entity6			1
" @entity30 , @entity35 and @entity36 -- the team @entity35 will drive for in sunday 's race -- had a private meeting with @entity24 officials , community leaders , first responders and victims ' families in early february			1

@entity4 says 100 % of the funds raised will go directly to help meet the needs of the @entity24 community			1
those needs are two-fold , according to @entity13			0
first , he said he hopes having a personal connection to the race will give the townspeople a boost , even if momentarily			0
a city official " told me that after that meeting she 'd seen smiles on some people 's faces that she had n't seen since the devastating events of december 14			0
so on sunday for a little bit of time at least , i think the town can escape reality and enjoy one of the greatest sporting events in the world with something to root for , " @entity13 said			1
" and secondly who knows what kind of therapy and recovery the children and schoolteachers and the people of the town will need going forward			0
so it 's going to be a lot of money for counseling and helping people through that day and who knows what all the money could be used for -- a memorial , a new school			0
... we just want to make sure that there 's always money there to help people in need			0
" @entity35 also owns a racing team , @entity107 , and all three of his drivers entered in sunday 's race -- @entity111 in no. 15 , @entity112 in no. 55 and @entity113 in no. 56 -- will have decals on their cars to support the cause			1
" we 're ready to go racing , ready to put some smiles on faces and raise money , " @entity13 said , who also is tweeting information about the campaign drive			1
donations have already started coming in , @entity13 said			0
@entity4 chairman and ceo @entity125 and his wife , @entity127 , pledged a personal donation of $ 50,000 , and the @entity129 has matched that donation , according to @entity13			1
" looking out at a room of smiling faces amidst the aftermath of a horrible tragedy was very powerful , " @entity125 said			0
" it hit me that the @entity4 industry and our passionate fan base have an unbelievable opportunity to rally around this cause and make a huge difference			1
" @entity13 is counting on fans when he climbs into his car sunday afternoon , and he said he has faith his extended family will come through for the people of @entity24			1
" i think you see it all the time and that 's the reason why we do it because they ( fans ) respond , they support			0
they want to help worthy causes as well so we rely on that 75 million people in our fan base to step up when we have a great cause			0
and that 's what makes it so special that the fans really appreciate what we do and they really want to be a part of it			2
" he added , " driving the no. 26 @entity57 @entity170 is like nothing i have ever been part of in my @entity4 career			2
it will be an emotional week knowing that we have the potential to do so much good for the @entity24 community			0
i 'm racing for a reason			0
