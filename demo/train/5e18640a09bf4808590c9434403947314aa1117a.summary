-- next year 's college applicants have some difficult choices to make			2
is it better to go to state school or private ? stay close to home or ship out to @entity6 ? @entity8 students receiving their education in the @entity10 is not as far - fetched as it might sound as some of the world 's most respected collegiate brands have set up outposts in the @entity16			1
@entity17 hosts 52 universities while @entity19 has set up @entity20 , a sector that houses a number of @entity24 colleges including @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28			1
next year , the first students admitted to @entity30 ( @entity30 ) @entity6 will graduate ; a benchmark almost as significant as the scheduled completion of the university 's new @entity34 campus			0
" there are lots of exciting signs that the region is heating up and getting more dynamic in terms of higher education , " says @entity36 , the editor - at - large of @entity38			1
" there 's recognition ( in the @entity16 ) that they need to prepare for the post-oil world , and they realize that a knowledge - based economy ensures growth in the future			1
" several local universities have stepped up their game , too , building state - of - the - art research facilities to attract students from abroad			1
even @entity57 is getting in on the act			0
this year witnessed the completion of princess @entity60 ( @entity62 ) in @entity63 -- a 2,000 acre site and the largest all - female university in the world			1
in several instances , investment in education in the region has paid off			1
one of the most prominent collegiate success stories is @entity72 , which started accepting students to its @entity10 hub four years ago			1

prospective students often have to decide between @entity72 and top tier universities like @entity90 and @entity91			2
in recent years , the school has been dubbed " the world 's honors college "			0
@entity30 president @entity95 -- the brainchild behind the project -- has lofty goals			0
" our mandate is to create in @entity72 a school that educates the leaders of global civil society , from every sector of the world , and in every sector of society , " he says			0
though the @entity111 outpost has , according to @entity95 , " done a great deal to help @entity30 elevate its game , " other universities in the area have met with more mixed results			2
a cheating scandal at the @entity17 campus of @entity118 's @entity117 earlier this year underscored the concerns that universities with operations overseas are not able to maintain their standards			2
other institutions , such as the @entity124 in @entity17 , had to close because of a lack of enrollment , while @entity127 curtailed it undergraduate program and now only offers six masters degrees			2
" there have been some examples of market failure , of universities embarrassing themselves and getting it wrong , rather than planting their flag abroad , " says @entity36			2
" the issue is , how much are they invested ? are they just about pushing the global brand abroad , or are they genuinely on the ground , creating an infrastructure that will last ? " even with the success stories , the moral implications of doing business in states with limited freedom of speech and mixed human rights records has left some critics feeling uncomfortable			1

back in @entity163 , some of @entity30 's faculty members have also expressed concern about the @entity10 's stance towards gays ( illegal ) and @entity167 ( unrecognized )			1
@entity95 , however , is unperturbed			0
" my experience of the @entity111 is that it 's a very open society			0
now , it 's not @entity171 but as you move through the world you have to adapt to local customs			0
my daughter does n't dress the same way in @entity178 as she does in @entity179 ; when i 'm in the @entity180 , i 'm not as free to criticize public officials as i am in the @entity24 you just have to be aware of rules and regulations , " he says			0
@entity185 , a senior at @entity72 , agrees with @entity95			0
her experience , she notes , is about getting exposure to a wide cross section of cultures , not about imposing her own			0
" in my classes , every country we refer to has a case study right there ; chances are , someone in the classroom that will have had that experience , no matter what it is , " she says .			0
