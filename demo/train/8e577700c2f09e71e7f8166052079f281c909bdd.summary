-- a mysterious @entity3 pattern of space debris seen by @entity6 's @entity5 was probably two asteroids that collided , scientists said tuesday			1
the object , called @entity9 , was discovered in the asteroid belt between @entity11 and @entity12 by the @entity14 sky survey , or @entity14 , on january 6 , @entity6 said			1
the shape , and the streamers of dust shooting off of it , were photographed by @entity5 on january 25 and 29 , according to @entity6			1
astronomers have long thought the asteroid belt is being ground down because of collisions , but such a head - on crash had never been seen before			2
" if this interpretation is correct , two small and previously unknown asteroids recently collided , creating a shower of debris that is being swept back into a tail from the collision site by the pressure of sunlight , " said principal investigator @entity22 , from the @entity23 at @entity24			0
at first , astronomers thought what they saw might be a main belt comet , a rare case of a comet orbiting while in the asteroid belt			2
but the images taken by @entity5 revealed the complex x-pattern of filamentary structures near the object 's nucleus			0
@entity22 said the filaments are made of dust and gravel			0
some of them are being swept back by radiation pressure from sunlight , creating the long , straight dust streaks , he said			0
the nucleus of the presumed boom is 460 feet in diameter , @entity6 said			0
asteroid collisions happen fast , with an average impact speed of more than 11,000 mph , or five times faster than a rifle bullet .			1

@entity6 says @entity14 survey saw apparent crash , @entity5 *telescope* photographed it
the collision *appeared* as a *giant* " x " shape , with trails of dust and gravel
astronomers think crashes are *shrinking* asteroid belt , but none had been viewed
asteroid collisions happen fast -- 11,000 mph , @entity6 says
