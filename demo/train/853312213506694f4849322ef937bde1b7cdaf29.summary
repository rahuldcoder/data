@entity0 -- take a soccer - crazy crowd and a traditional @entity5 opening ceremony			1
add a splash of corporate sponsorship , and sprinkle in some black - clad , gun - toting security			2
what you 're left with is the @entity11 of soccer -- @entity0 style			1
the 16 - team , two - week tournament culminated saturday with the field narrowed down to @entity16 and @entity17			1
the idea for the contest was the brainchild of @entity22 aid worker @entity21 and a @entity5 colleague			1
" there were a lot of us who were offended that @entity0 is not allowed to participate with the rest of the world -- whether it 's diplomacy , whether it 's schooling , whether it 's education or whether it 's sports , " @entity21 said			2
" so we chose to try and come up with something special			0
and in this case , a @entity0 @entity11			1
if the rest of the world gets a @entity11 , we thought @entity0 should get one too			1
" while the teams wore the colors of @entity16 and @entity17 , almost all of the players were @entity5			1
foreign nationals working for the @entity42 and other aid organizations rounded out the teams to give it its international flavor			1
@entity22 player @entity46 played for the @entity16 team			2
he said they found a way to work past the language barrier			0
" when i get out there , it 's more like , ' @entity46 , go forward , go forward , go forward			0
do n't kick the ball out of bounds , ' " he said			0
a crowd of several thousand men , along with a few women , watched the two teams battle in a game played down to the proverbial wire			0
after scoring a goal a piece , the match went into overtime -- with the @entity16 besting the @entity17 on penalty shots			1
the crowd , as expected , went wild			0
and the jubilation of the players could not be contained			0
one jumped up on the rail separating the field from the spectators , took off his jersey and led the crowd in a raucous chant			0
while organizers had hoped to keep politics out of the cup , the politicians could not stay away			0
@entity81 prime minister @entity80 presided over the award ceremony			0
but this was a day for @entity84 to put aside politics and their many problems , at least for a while , and bask in the glory of hosting -- and winning -- the @entity11 .			2
