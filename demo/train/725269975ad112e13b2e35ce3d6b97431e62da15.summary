-- the cost of college tuition will continue to rise as long as federal student aid programs continue to increase with little or no accountability			1
that was the hypothesis ( now known in education circles as the @entity7 ) of a column i wrote for the @entity10 in 1987 , in response to tuition hikes at many of the nation 's colleges and universities			1
i had noticed an interesting phenomenon : increases in federal financial aid were not improving college affordability			1
each year , federal financial aid outlays would increase , but college tuitions would continue to rise above and beyond the rate of inflation			1
much like the effects of subsidies on health care and the housing market , increasing student aid was insulating colleges from having to make market - driven cost - cutting measures , like improving productivity or efficiency			1
it appears that this may still be true today			0
last month , @entity36 at the @entity37 and @entity38 authored a new paper introducing the " @entity40 2.0 , " an updated version of my original argument			0
under the current financial aid system , he concluded , " as higher financial aid pushes costs higher , it inevitably puts upward pressure on tuition			1
higher tuition , of course , reduces college affordability , leading to calls for more financial aid , setting the vicious cycle in motion all over again			1
" in 1987 , i reached my hypothesis by examining the basic relationship between federal financial aid and tuition			1
let 's compare the numbers today			0
in 2010 , the @entity63 distributed $ 133 billion in student aid			2
in 2011 , it was nearly $ 157 billion , a 17 % increase			0
@entity67 increased from $ 29 billion in 2010 to $ 36 billion in 2011 , a 24 % increase			0
at the same time , in 2011 , costs at the average public university rose 5.4 % for in - state students , or about $ 1,100			0
average tuition at public universities rose 8.3 %			0
the increases have greatly outpaced the rate of inflation , which was 3 % in 2011			0
while increased federal aid does not cause college price inflation , it can be a considerable factor			1
many other elements influence tuition prices , such as the rise of alumni donations , the expansions of institutional services and the ever - increasing demand for higher education			1
families will go to incredible , and often insane , lengths to get their son or daughter into college , and these institutions know that			2
nevertheless , the federal mechanism intended to make college more affordable seems to be having little or no effect			2
furthermore , taxpayers are getting fewer returns for their money			0
in 2009 , the six - year graduation rate of bachelor 's students was 56 % in the @entity104			2
in 1997 , it was 52 %			0
during that time period , student aid skyrocketed			2
according to the @entity109 , " total student aid increased by about 84 % in inflation - adjusted dollars over the decade from 1997 - 98 to 2007 - 08			2
" taxpayers are subsidizing higher education at greater and greater costs while institutional performance has not kept up			1
this gap between enrollment and graduation costs the @entity104 economy millions of dollars in potential earnings each year and expands the growing student loan bubble			1
weighed down by rising tuition costs , students borrow more money each year to pay for college			2
the more they borrow , the more difficult it becomes for them to pay for college on their own or in a timely manner , and if they fail to graduate , they are left holding larger piles of debt			2
according to the @entity130 , student loan indebtedness reached $ 867 billion last year			1
( by comparison , outstanding @entity104 credit card debt was $ 704 billion			1
) and almost 15 % of all borrowers have at least one past - due loan account			0
there are legitimate fears that this could be the next @entity104 debt bomb			1
why should taxpayers continue to increase funding for federal aid programs that do little to control soaring college costs and rein in student debt ? like the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis , the middle class would be crushed by a mass student loan default			1
our students and their families deserve better than this			0
as i said 25 years ago , " higher education is not underfunded			1
it is under - accountable			0
" federal aid should be closely tied to academic performance , graduation rates and the ability of students to repay their loans in a responsible manner			2
during his @entity161 address this year , president @entity160 said , " we ca n't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition			0
" he added , " so let me put colleges and universities on notice			0
if you ca n't stop tuition from going up , the funding you get from taxpayers will go down			1
" it 's encouraging to see the president acknowledge what has long been the argument of conservative education reformers			0
it remains to be seen if his threat holds any weight and if he will act on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity182 : increases in federal financial aid do n't seem to improve college affordability
@entity182 : taxpayers subsidize higher education , but institutions ' performances have n't kept up
he says student loan indebtedness could be the next @entity104 debt bomb
@entity182 : colleges need to keep costs down , or else taxpayers should stop the funding
