but @entity11 's supporters -- conservative lawyers , madrasa students and others -- converged on the courthouse			2

officials say judge @entity65 was asked to come to @entity0 to preside over the hearing			2

despite that assessment , the @entity82 employed @entity11 for security this week			0
the warning signs about @entity11 go back even further , said @entity93 , senior police official in @entity43			1
@entity1 intelligence agencies had warned officials in 2004 not to use @entity11 after they uncovered connections between him and the religious group @entity97 -- a @entity99 group that claims it has a closer connection to the @entity23 than other @entity101			2

a court found the 45 - year - old woman guilty of defiling the name of the @entity23 during a 2009 argument with fellow @entity101 field workers			0
an investigation by a @entity1 government ministry found the charges against @entity143 stemmed from " religious and personal enmity " and recommended she be released			0
the government also said it would review the law			0
@entity14 said he would like to see the law " changed in such a way that it just basically says , if you insult any prophet , no matter who he is , that 's a criminal offense , but certainly not punishable by death			2
