-- if you 're a " zombie aficionado , " a " web marketing guru " or a " social media evangelist , " you may be doing @entity4 wrong			1
the 160 - character @entity4 bio , your introduction to the site 's nearly 250 million active users , has been called a " postmodern art form " by @entity10			1
but for most of us , it 's a bit simpler than that			0
it 's a digital calling card , a way to sum up our very essence within @entity4 's 160 - character limit and , presumably , tell people why they might want to follow us			1
so how did there end up being so many self - proclaimed ninjas , mavens , rock stars , gurus and experts on the site ? those terms , often delivered in a series of short , punchy sentences , have become copycat cliches in the @entity4 age			1
and as @entity35 sees it , they 're worthy of parody			0
" i 'd noticed that a lot of @entity4 bios tended to be pretty samey , " said @entity38 , a web developer and creator of the @entity41			1
" when that occurred to me , i crawled the bios of all my @entity4 acquaintances and saw that ... yep ... some patterns were used a lot			1
" his generator is a jokey tool that mashes together a bunch of overused words and phrases , creating bios that will look impressively familiar to most @entity4 users : " professional zombie geek			1
" " social media evangelist			0
" it 's no accident that a lot of the phrases come off as blatantly self - promotional			2
" this was early @entity4 days , when it seemed like half the folks using the service were self - described ' social media experts , ' " @entity38 said			1
" plenty of the rest of us were of the opinion that those folks might benefit from taking themselves a bit less seriously			0
so if the generator came across as poking a little fun at them , i 'd be ok with that			0
" @entity38 is n't the only one who thought that overdone bio style needed a little skewering			2
this month , digital media marketing publication @entity83 worked up a similar , if significantly more profane , version called " what the @entity86 --- is my @entity41 ? "			2
( fair warning : lots of profanity			0
as if the name did n't give that away			2
) " the idea was meant to be a way for people to realize the ridiculous lengths others -- and , alas , themselves -- go to to craft their @entity4 bio as neatly and perfectly as a @entity101 movie , " @entity83 staffer @entity93 said in a blog post			1
@entity83 's combination of about 300 words and phrases renders bios largely similar to @entity38 's generator : " bluetooth pundit			2
" some tweak another bio that 's become commonplace : a series of factual information followed by a final zinger to show that you 're a serious person -- just not * that * serious			0
if users do n't like the result , they can click a reliably foul - mouthed link to try again			1
some of the results also play on @entity4 users ' seemingly limitless fondness for bacon and booze in their bios			1
so , if being a bacon buff or beer trailblazer wo n't necessarily make for a great bio , what will ? @entity38 says just be yourself			2
" it 's an honest reflection of what you 're going to be tweeting about , " he said			0
" for some people , that will be the sort of straightforward list thing the @entity41 pokes a little fun at			0
for others , it 'll be something more abstract or poetic			0
maybe they 're more abstract or poetic people , harder to pin down			0
" writing for @entity146 , a @entity0 content partner , @entity147 offered a few suggestions of her own			0
-- your bio is searchable , so make sure it includes keywords about what you tweet about			0
-- avoid those generator - style cliches			1
-- double - check your spelling and grammar			1
-- look at other bios and imitate the style of the ones you like			2
" most importantly , " she wrote , " use your bio to let people know what you 're going to bring to their @entity4 streams -- how following you is going to enrich their @entity4 experience			1
" of course , as with many things , if you 're famous some rules do n't apply to you			2
does @entity169 really need to let you know he was a basketball player ? and if you 're considering following @entity172 or @entity173 , there 's a pretty good chance you already knew they were talk show hosts			0
the creative freedom in being famous has led to some of our favorite bios : @entity181 - winning actor @entity180 : " former shoe salesman now making a go at film and theater			1
wish me luck ... " actress @entity187 : " i am a tiny @entity188			0
" comedian @entity189 : " @entity191 's sponsor " @entity191 : " friend of @entity189 's			0
" the @entity4 bios of some celebs , like @entity195 and @entity196 , go one step further -- they 're blank			1
she 's @entity195 ! what more can you say ? and then there 's @entity202			0
the former first lady , @entity205 senator and secretary of state joined @entity4 last year and promptly wrote what 's been called the " best bio of all time " -- a combination of informative and playful			1
it reads : " wife , mom , lawyer , women & kids advocate , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , author , dog owner , hair icon , pantsuit aficionado , glass ceiling cracker , @entity226 ... "			0

cliches abound in @entity4 bios , those 160 - character digital calling cards
generators have been created to mimic " ninjas , " " rock stars " and gurus "
good bios should be true to who you are
do n't forget basics like spelling and grammar
