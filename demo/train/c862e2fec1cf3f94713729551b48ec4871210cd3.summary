-- @entity2 politicians have a deep need to interpret foreign leaders and foreign cultures and governments as though they were @entity2			1
thursday night on " crossfire " , i described the @entity10 president as a @entity12 official of enormous toughness			1
in fact , we showed @entity16 in his @entity12 colonel 's uniform to drive home the reality of who he is			1
@entity16 is a great @entity10 nationalist who is coldly and methodically maneuvering to maximize @entity10 's prestige and influence			1
and why should n't he ? it is his country			0
it has a longer history than we do			0
he served in the most intensely pro-soviet institution in the old empire			0
yet , @entity2 politicians keep rejecting the realities of @entity16 's life , statements and actions			1
@entity16 jabs @entity2 this is a bipartisan self - deception			1
in june 2001 , then president @entity38 met him for the first time and concluded : " i looked the man in the eye			0
i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue			0
" i was able to get a sense of his soul			0
" he 's a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country and i appreciate very much the frank dialogue and that 's the beginning of a very constructive relationship			0
" @entity53 : @entity54 a distraction from real @entity2 challenges this was said two years after @entity16 launched the second @entity59 war in which an estimated 300,000 @entity59 would be ruthlessly killed			1
it also assumed a former @entity12 agent has a soul that is viewable			1
the less positive view came in august 2013 when president @entity64 compared his @entity10 counterpart to a tiresome schoolboy			2
" he 's got that kind of slouch , looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom , " @entity64 said of @entity16			2
but @entity16 is n't a bored kid			2
@entity16 is one of the most effective and successful leaders in the world			2
he took over a chaotic decaying @entity10 in the 1990s and methodically rebuilt the authoritarian state centered system he had learned from the @entity12			1
he may today be the strongest , most stable @entity10 leader since @entity78			1
he has achieved it with steady methodical application of power to isolate , imprison and , occasionally , kill those who oppose him			0
@entity16 's recent op - ed in the @entity84 was another calculated step			2
@entity16 despises @entity64 and resents his attitude and his tone			2
this was a chance to return the attitude			0
( @entity64 acknowledged the difference in an @entity93 interview : " i do n't think that mr. @entity16 has the same values that we do			2
" ) @entity2 politicians as usual tried to force @entity16 into an @entity2 frame of reference			1
the overall tone of @entity16 's latest broadside was too much for sen. @entity101 , chairman of the @entity102 , who said he read the article at dinner on wednesday			0
opinion : @entity2 ' exceptionalism ' -- who are they kidding ? " i almost wanted to vomit , " he said			0
" i worry when someone who came up through the @entity12 tells us what is in our national interests and what is not			0
" house speaker @entity115 said he was " insulted			0
" on a bipartisan basis , @entity2 politicians seemed surprised			1
if @entity2 leaders would spend a little time studying @entity10 history they would understand @entity16			1
he is a @entity10 nationalist and seen in that tradition is very understandable and even predictable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			0

@entity124 : @entity2 politicians reacted with surprise to the views of @entity16
he says @entity16 is understandable as a former @entity12 agent and @entity10 nationalist
politicians in both parties have *mistakenly* seen @entity16 as someone whom they can trust , he says
@entity53 : @entity16 is a strong authoritarian leader , maybe the strongest @entity10 boss since @entity78
