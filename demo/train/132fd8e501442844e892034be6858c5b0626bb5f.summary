@entity0 plans to send long - range bombers to the @entity3 in what appears to be @entity6 's latest provocative maneuver in its increasingly frosty relations with the @entity8			1
defense minister @entity9 said wednesday that " we have to maintain ( @entity0 's ) military presence in the western @entity13 and eastern @entity12 , as well as the @entity14 and the @entity3 " -- including sending bombers " as part of the drills			1
" it 's an argument @entity20 officials do n't seem to be buying			2
" we do not see the security environment as warranting such provocative and potentially destabilizing activity , " a senior @entity22 administration official said thursday			1
@entity26 spokeswoman @entity25 offered a similar response			0
" we do n't think there is a current situation in the western @entity13 and eastern @entity12 or the @entity14 and the @entity3 that warrants additional flights in out - of - area territory , " she told reporters			1
@entity9 said that @entity0 will also boost its security in @entity36 , the region it annexed from @entity38 earlier this year			1
" in many respects , this is connected with the situation in @entity38 , with fomentation of anti-russian moods on the part of @entity45 and reinforcement of foreign military presence next to our border , " he said			2
the ceasefire in volatile eastern @entity38 is crumbling , with @entity20 and allied officials accusing @entity6 of sending fresh troops , tanks and other military equipment across the border in recent days -- something that @entity0 officials have strongly denied			1
but what does that have to do with the @entity3 , some 6,000 miles away ? the @entity0 are clearly trying to make a point with their plan to send bombers toward the @entity3 , said @entity62 , a fellow at the @entity63			1
the message , he said , is " connected to the tensions over @entity38 that have also affected the broader relationship			2
" " it 's kind of a reciprocity , " @entity62 told @entity1			0
" they see us trying to muscle in on what they see as their sphere of influence			0
( @entity0 is likely thinking ) , ' if they can do it to us , we can do it them			2
' " @entity9 also said @entity0 will expand its presence in the @entity80 region , which could affect @entity81 and northern @entity82			2
this includes full radar coverage of that region by year 's end , leaving @entity0 ready " to meet unwanted guests " both from the north and east by 2015 , @entity9 said , according to a state - run @entity88 news agency report			2
that means @entity0 's new drills will fly near most of @entity20 's coastline , said @entity94 , an international security expert at the @entity96 - based @entity95 think tank			1
" we 're talking about ringing the @entity20 , with the exception of the @entity82 border , where the @entity0 bombers do n't need to go , " @entity94 said			1
it 's not as though the @entity20 does n't have its own warplanes in places like @entity105 and @entity106 , not to mention @entity45 air operations assisting @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity111 nations			2
and @entity62 , who previously served as a @entity26 adviser on @entity20 - @entity0 relations , notes that the @entity20 military also sometimes flies not far from @entity0 -- also to send a message , as well as to test things like response times			1
" it 's not necessarily anything to be overly alarmed about as long as the patrols stay in international airspace , " he said			0
and , as recently as june , @entity20 fighter jets have intercepted @entity0 long - range bombers off @entity81 and @entity124			1
those four @entity0 planes flew within an area 200 miles from the @entity128 coast			2
two peeled off and headed west , while the other two flew south and were intercepted by @entity20 f - 15s within 50 miles of the @entity124 coast			2
capt. @entity131 , a spokesman for the @entity132 ( @entity132 ) , said at the time that this was the first time @entity20 jets intercepted @entity0 military aircraft off @entity124 in about two years			1
but such incidents generally are not uncommon , with @entity131 estimating that @entity0 flights fly into the so - called air defense zone -- the area 200 miles from the @entity20 coast but not within the 13.8 miles that international law would define as @entity20 territory -- 10 times a year			1
yet there are signs that @entity0 has stepped up its military provocations as of late , some of which the @entity147 documented earlier this week			0
@entity0 provocations on the rise : is it a new @entity152 ? last month , the @entity154 military searched for a mystery underwater vessel after intercepting an emergency radio call in @entity0 and getting reports about a foreign vessel being spotted in the waters near @entity160			2
though no vessel was found , it was the largest submarine hunt in @entity154 waters since the end of the @entity152			0
in september , the @entity20 intercepted six @entity0 planes , including fighter jets and tankers , in airspace near @entity81 , officials said			1
the same month , an @entity171 official was abducted from a border post , taken to @entity6 and accused of espionage , sparking dueling claims between the two nations			0
the uptick in incidents have raised concerns about safety -- and about military and geopolitical issues , @entity94 said			0
" @entity0 ( is ) flexing its military muscle , identifying the @entity20 and @entity45 as the enemy			1
that feeling is not reciprocated , but we have a @entity0 that is starting to throw its military weight around , and in some ways , looking for provocations , " he said			0
" i think this could be very dangerous , and create a crisis , where one did n't need to exist			0
" and not only have the encounters escalated , so have the risks			0
in march , a covert @entity0 military plane nearly collided with a @entity154 passenger aircraft carrying 132 people			0
the " real danger " of new @entity0 flights near the @entity128 coast is that an accident actually happens or things " get a little bit out of hand			2
" @entity0 bombers fly near @entity124 " if there 's a collision or if somebody overreacted , " @entity62 said , that could inflame @entity20 - @entity0 tensions even further			1
he recalled a 2001 incident , in which a @entity20 spy plane collided with a @entity211 fighter jet before making an emergency landing inside @entity211			0
that episode shook up relations between @entity215 and @entity96			0
during the @entity152 , @entity217 warplanes were more frequent in areas around the @entity20			0
but @entity62 noted that changed with the fall of the @entity217 , in part because of cost			0
things slowly changed as @entity0 took shape , long before @entity38 became an issue			1
and there 's also interest in @entity6 in having close ties with its allies in the @entity229 , such as @entity230			0
" when i was in government four or five years ago , when there was definitely concern that this was becoming more frequent even then , " @entity62 said of about @entity0 military provocations			0
" this is n't happening out of the blue			0
" still , there 's no doubt that the @entity38 crisis is the driving wedge in @entity20 - @entity0 relations at this point			1
a ceasefire deal reached in september has seemingly crumbled , with intensified fighting of late between @entity38 forces and @entity247 rebels			0
those rebels have been joined by @entity0 troops , tanks , artillery and air defense systems that have recently crossed the border , according to @entity20 gen. @entity253 , @entity45 's commander for @entity254			1
' unusual ' @entity0 flights concern @entity45 on thursday , @entity38 defense spokesman @entity256 said there 's been " constant movement of @entity0 military equipment with ( separatist ) marks to the dividing line			1
" yet @entity0 , as it 's done time and again , is knocking down any claims that it has troops inside @entity38 territory			1
" i am telling you very frankly and officially as well : there are no military forces or any military movement across the border , and moreover there is no presence of our troops in the territory of ( southeast ) @entity38 , " foreign ministry spokesman @entity270 said			0
@entity1 's @entity281 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 contributed to this report .			0

@entity20 official : plan is " provocative and potentially destabilizing "
@entity0 : patrols could include the @entity14 and the @entity3
that would bring the flights close to @entity20 territorial waters
