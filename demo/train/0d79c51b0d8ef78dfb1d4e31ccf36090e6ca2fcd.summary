on sunday morning sept. 15 , 1963 , a dynamite bomb exploded at the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , killing four black children , and injuring many others			1
the names of the dead girls were @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 , and @entity11			0
that afternoon a phone rang at the house of @entity14 , the editor of the @entity15			1
@entity14 was mowing the lawn , his nine - year - old daughter @entity17 nearby			1
the call from the office carried the horrible news from @entity2			1
@entity14 , without changing his clothes , drove to town and with tears in his eyes banged out a column so powerful that @entity26 would ask him to read it for the @entity28			1
it began : a @entity31 mother wept in the street sunday morning in front of a @entity1 in @entity2			1
in her hand she held a shoe , one shoe , from the foot of her dead child			2
we hold that shoe with her			0
every one of us in the white @entity42 holds that small shoe in his hand			1
it is too late to blame the sick criminals who handled the dynamite			0
the @entity48 and the police can deal with that kind			0
the charge against them is simple			0
only we can trace the truth , @entity42 -- you and i. we broke those children 's bodies			1
@entity60 once wrote that it is the job of the poet to find the sacred object that correlates to the emotion he wants to express			0
for @entity14 , the object was that one small shoe : we hold that shoe in our hand , @entity42			1
let us see it straight , and look at the blood on it			0
let us compare it with the unworthy speeches of @entity42 public men who have traduced the @entity31 ; match it with the spectacle of shrilling children whose parents and teachers turned them free to spit epithets at small huddles of @entity31 school children for a week before this sunday in @entity2 ; hold up the shoe and look beyond it to the state house in @entity85 where the official attitudes of @entity3 have been spoken in heat and anger			1
@entity14 's mentor @entity89 once criticized his own early editorials on issues of racial justice as " pale tea , " and @entity14 accepted the judgment for himself			1
every day from 1960 to 1968 , he wrote a signed editorial column in the paper , many of them devoted to issues of segregation and racial equality			2
as the years went by , his voice grew stronger			0
in those more than 3,000 columns @entity14 urged @entity42 to do the right thing , to embrace @entity105 charity and common decency , to follow the law , promising that if they changed , " the sky would not fall			1
" " i see what you 're doing , " one reader accused			0
" you 're trying to make us think we 're better than we are			0
" on many days , @entity14 's column expressed sympathy for the plight of the white southerner and confidence that the @entity42 could change on its own , without the heavy hand of the federal government			1
but not on september 15 , 1963			2
in a column that runs 553 words , @entity14 uses the words ' we , ' ' us , ' and ' our , ' more than twenty times : let us not lay the blame on some brutal fool who did n't know any better			1
may @entity129 have mercy on the poor @entity42 that has so been led			1
may what has happened hasten the day when the good @entity42 , which does live and has great being , will rise to this challenge of racial understanding and common humanity , and in the full power of its unasserted courage , assert itself			1
the sunday school play at @entity2 is ended			1
with a weeping @entity31 mother , we stand in the bitter smoke and hold a shoe			0
if our @entity42 is ever to be what we wish it to be , we will plant a flower of nobler resolve for the @entity42 now upon these four small graves that we dug			1
it is almost unimaginable today that a columnist would be asked to read his work on the evening network news , but that 's what happened to @entity14 when @entity28 and @entity26 called			1
( recordings of that show have not survived			2
) the broadcast carried the message of that one small shoe around the nation			0
@entity14 received more than 2,000 letters in response			2
@entity14 would go on to win a @entity162 in 1967 for his editorial columns on racial justice			2
he briefly served as managing editor of the @entity166 , taught at @entity167 , and became editor of the @entity169 ( now the @entity169 ) and chairman of the @entity171 , the school for journalism and democracy where i have worked since 1979			0
@entity14 hired me to teach writing there and became my friend and mentor until his death earlier this year at the age of 89			2
the library at @entity171 is named after him			0
his photo hangs there , not far from a calligraphed rendition of his famous editorial			0
it is part of an artistic work by the late @entity189 artist @entity188 called " i remember @entity2 , " comprising four glass cubes , each one representing one of the dead girls			2
words etched on the glass are intended to be " heard " as the lost voices of the victims			0
the translucent cubes remind us of the stained - glass shattered in the bombings			0
( three former members of the @entity202 were eventually convicted of murder for the bombings ; one survives , in prison			0
) this may be the 50th anniversary of their deaths , but i think of those four girls every day of my working life			1
@entity14 never took credit for his progressive views on race			2
he knew what he was doing was dangerous			0
a ball peen hammer in a desk drawer not far from his typewriter was there for any klansman who might wander in			0
" i never had to use it , " he told me , " but i pulled out the drawer a couple of times			0
" he repeated again and again that the heroes of that era were black civil rights workers who put their lives on the line every day to dismantle @entity233 's version of apartheid , men and women such as rep. @entity237			0
i met @entity237 at a tribute for @entity14 held in 2002 at @entity14 's old newspaper in @entity240			1
@entity14 , who had been a tank commander in @entity242 's army , was an emotional man who could almost never bring himself to read his old work aloud , so i read " a flower for the @entity247 " to a group of assembled admirers			1
" i remember reading it back then , " rep. @entity237 told me			0
" i had tears in my eyes			0
" in 2003 @entity14 did a radio interview with @entity253 in @entity254			2
host @entity255 asked @entity14 to read the column on the air , and he did so reluctantly , but only a couple of passages , his voice rising like a preacher when he came to the phrase " one shoe			1
" " @entity129 , @entity14 , you still sound angry , " said @entity264			2
@entity14 responded , his voice catching , " about that -- yeah			2
