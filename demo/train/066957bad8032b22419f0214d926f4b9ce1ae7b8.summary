" the ship was anchored off the coast of @entity7 , within @entity7 's 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) territorial limit , @entity15 said			1
he would not comment on the pirates ' demands out of concern for the crew of four @entity34 and five @entity35 , and would not say whether the shipping company was negotiating with them			2
