-- the masked man had already cut her chest open when the lights went off , plunging the entire room into darkness			0
in fact , it was downright dangerous			0
a power outage is probably the last thing anyone would want to happen midway through surgery , let alone while performing the delicate task of closing a hole inside the heart of a six - year - old girl			1
but dr @entity18 and his team had come prepared			1
" we knew that we always have power cuts in the hospital -- they can happen at any time , even at night -- so we had prepared a back - up manual handle that we could use to run the pump by hand , " says @entity18 , who works at the @entity20 in @entity21 , north @entity22			1
a reliable and constant electricity supply is crucial when performing open heart surgery -- the procedure is done under general anesthesia and requires the use of an electrically powered machine that acts as the patient 's heart and lung			1
read this : birth advice by text message @entity18 and his team also knew that it usually takes several seconds for the hospital 's back - up generator to kick in after a power failure			1
therefore , they 'd previously connected the heart - lung and anesthesia machines to an uninterruptible power supply in case of an emergency			2
" even though all the lights in the operating room went off , the machines themselves were still working , " recalls the young doctor			0
" so this was what actually saved us that day			0
" saving lives that day was late last month , right after @entity18 had returned to @entity22 from @entity62 with a skill no one else in his country has			1
following five years of intense training , @entity18 is now @entity22 's only pediatric heart surgeon capable of carrying out open heart surgeries on small children			1
upon his arrival , he started operating on young children , including six - year - old @entity72 , with the assistance of the @entity62 team who 'd trained him			2
" although we had all these problems in the surgery , the child recovered very well and she left the intensive care unit the next day , " says @entity18 about @entity72			2
" so this was very good			0
" ' somebody has to do something ' the son of a doctor , @entity18 grew up in @entity87 , a beautiful small town nestled on the foothills of @entity89			2
he went on to become a doctor himself and started practicing about seven years ago , setting his mind to becoming a plastic surgeon			0
but at that time a @entity22 surgeon who 'd returned home from the @entity95 , with the aim of starting a cardiac center , recruited @entity18 to his team			1
" it 's when i started working with him that i realized that ... in @entity22 we really do n't have so much need for plastic surgery , " says @entity18			1
" i realized children are the ones who are suffering most in @entity107 -- we have so many children with heart diseases dying without any care and those few lucky ones the government gets to send them abroad for surgery , " he adds			2
watch this : ghana'a heart surgery pioneer determined to make a difference , @entity18 approached doctors visiting the hospital , asking them to help him find a way to create a @entity22 team that could do pediatric heart surgery			1
eventually , he got in touch with @entity123 , an @entity62 organization providing heart surgeries and care to children from developing countries			2
after securing funding , @entity18 headed to @entity62 where he trained for five years with @entity123 before returning to @entity22 and putting his life - saving knowledge to use			1
" somebody has to do something -- and this is one of the reasons i came back , " says @entity18			2
" but do i feel confident that i will be able to build a good department and a good team ? well not really , " he readily admits			2
" so i am also very terrified of the fact that i am worried that i may not be able to build this good team			0
but again , it 's this worry which will keep me up on my feet every day trying to push a little bit harder			0
" urgent needs when it comes to impoverished @entity107 nations , the focus often tends to be on @entity144 , malnutrition and malaria			0
but there are a multitude of other medical conditions that require urgent attention , such as children 's heart problems			1
in @entity22 's largest referral and teaching hospital , some 300 children a year await surgery			1
there are thousands more in need across the country			0
read this : @entity107 midwife , @entity161 ? @entity18 says there are , at best , just 5,000 doctors in @entity22 , a country where more than 70 % of the 45 million - population lives in villages , often far from hospitals or equipped medical centers			1
he says this puts a " big burden " on doctors who often have to work under extremely challenging conditions			0
" many doctors do n't want to even go out of the big cities , " he explains			0
" every doctor wants to work in a place where there 's at least some medication , there 's even a ward ... that they can also provide this kind of care			0
now going to the village with all the knowledge that you 've acquired and you still can not manage to do anything -- these are places no doctor wants to go			0
" healing hearts inside the @entity20 , the overwhelming need for doctors and trained medical personnel is evident			0
at the hospital 's children 's ward , the beds are occupied at all times by two , sometimes three , very sick children , while young patients with heart problems and their families lie on benches outside examining rooms			1
it 's a far cry from the wards where @entity18 trained in @entity62			2
" working in @entity62 , " says @entity18 , " one of the things that struck me most at the beginning was that we could spend six months and not even see one child dying , while here in a day , one pediatric admission , we could see even five , sometimes up to seven , children dying , " he adds			1
" you realize that we still have a very long way to go			0
" but despite all the challenges , @entity18 is determined to continue his life - saving efforts and build a team that would heal as many of @entity22 's broken hearts as possible			1
" now i am even thinking of the ways to push my department forward , " says @entity18			0
" i know i do n't have a complete team yet , some are still in training back in @entity62 , but it is my hope in the next few years that we will have a complete team , if everything goes well			0
