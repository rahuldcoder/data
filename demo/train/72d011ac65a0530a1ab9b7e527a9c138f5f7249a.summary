" and the lucky gal is ... @entity9 ! @entity10 joins the previously cast @entity11 ( " @entity12 " ) as the matriarch and patriarch of @entity15 , the name of @entity17 's dramatic re-imagining of the old show that starred @entity19 as @entity4 and @entity20 as @entity21			1

why the title change ? here 's what @entity17 told @entity0 : " the script is such a dramatic departure from the tone and style of the original show			2
if we continued to call the show ' the @entity7 , ' people are just going to to think we 're doing ' the @entity7			2
' we 're doing a reinvention and re-imagination of this property			2
i love the @entity41 monsters			2
i love @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46			0
there 's so many great characters we can run through this metaphor of family storytelling that it just felt it was ripe to do as a one - hour dramedy			0
having all those elements to play with , the toy box is really , really full			1
" " @entity15 " was originally developed for fall , but casting the show turned out to be a lot harder than @entity17 and @entity1 had planned			1
the primary issue was finding the right cast			1
" i tend to write in a very tricky tone , " @entity17 told @entity0			0
" it 's hard to find actors who are agile enough to navigate the turns			0
there 's mouthfuls of dialog			0
fortunately , we went to @entity68 as @entity69 very early in the process			0
he 's a great piece of casting for us			1
" @entity10 was previously attached to @entity73 , an @entity74 comedy that she was producing with her partner @entity76 , but the pilot did n't get ordered for fall			1
