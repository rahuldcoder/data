-- @entity1 was always a leader with one eye fixed on his own place in history			1
in his frequent bombastic moments , the late @entity6 president liked to imagine himself still in power in 2021 , the bicentenary of his nation 's independence , and as a latter - day @entity12 , the @entity14 - born soldier - statesman who liberated much of @entity15 from @entity17 rule and remains one of the continent 's most revered sons			0
some saw in @entity1 's overseeing of the reinterment of @entity12 's remains in a grandiose new mausoleum -- perhaps with his own fading health in mind -- an attempt to forge that connection in monumental form			1
@entity1 , influential leader with mixed record , dies at 58 yet , it 's only now , with @entity1 's premature death tuesday at age 58 , that we can begin to assess the legacy of one of the early 21st century 's most politically gifted but divisive figures and his self - styled " @entity38			1
" having once served time in jail for leading a failed coup , @entity1 perhaps made an unlikely convert to democracy			1
yet , through a blaze of landslide elections and referenda , he placed his fortunes in the hands of the poor and the marginalized , demanding their votes as a first step towards building a new political order that would work in their interests			0
@entity1 's initial 1998 election victory was hailed by the vote observers of the @entity57 - based @entity56 as " a true demonstration of democracy at work " and " a peaceful revolution through the ballot box			1
" in that year , @entity1 won 56 % of the vote on a 65 % turnout			1
when he earned re-election in 2006 , his support had swelled to almost 63 % on a near - 75 % turnout -- the high watermark of his electoral fortunes			0
between the two , @entity1 defied an attempted coup in 2002 when hundreds of thousands of his supporters poured down from the hillside barrios of @entity14 in protest , and a 2004 opposition - orchestrated referendum on his leadership made possible by the constitution introduced by @entity1 himself in 1999			1
@entity1 leaves a revolutionary legacy " a strange dictator , this @entity1 , " wrote @entity81 author @entity80 at the time of that referendum			1
@entity80 is the author of a leading dependency theory interpretation of @entity87 , " @entity88 , " that @entity1 gave to @entity57 president @entity89 as a present after he won election			2
" this tyrant invented by the mass media , this fearsome demon , has just given a tremendous vitamin - injection to democracy , which , both in @entity97 and elsewhere , has become rickety and enfeebled , " @entity80 wrote of @entity1			1
once in power , @entity1 diverted revenues from @entity6 's oil industry into a series of healthcare , education and anti-poverty initiatives known as misiones , opening subsidized supermarkets and clinics -- many staffed by @entity109 medics -- in the country 's poorest communities			2
between 1998 and 2006 the percentage of @entity6 living below the poverty line fell from 50.4 % to 36.3 % , according to statistics from the @entity115			0
infant mortality fell from 20.3 per thousand births when @entity1 came to power to 12.9 by 2011 , according to the same source			2
education also became more accessible , with the number of children enrolled in secondary education rising from 48 % in 1999 to 72 % in 2010 , according to @entity124 figures			0
visiting @entity14 ahead of the 2006 election , i met a friend who had recently graduated from a newly established public university which charged its students just 300 bolivars a term , at the time the equivalent of about 15 cents			0
previously , he explained , students in higher education had to pay about 1 million bolivars a month to go to a private university			0
as we walked , he pointed out a stall selling orange juice for 500 bolivars a glass			0
" look at that , " said my friend , " education under @entity1 is cheaper than orange juice			2
" @entity144 : share your thoughts on the death of the @entity6 president yet it will be for his interventions on the world stage that @entity1 will be remembered beyond his homeland			1
outspoken and often wildly undiplomatic , @entity1 thrived on the intransigence and widespread international unpopularity of the @entity157 - era @entity156 , never more so than when he referred to his then - @entity57 counterpart as " the devil " in addressing the @entity160 in 2006			2
in @entity97 , he provided inspiration for the rise of a generation of leftist leaders , notably @entity165 in @entity166 and @entity167 in @entity168 , and breathed fresh life -- and oil supplies -- into @entity109 's anemic revolution			1
others in @entity173 and @entity174 benefited from the renewed sense of regional confidence and solidarity that @entity1 brought to the table			2
he also had a deft appreciation of the mischievous power of gesture politics , sending " humanitarian aid " in the form of discounted fuel to one of the most deprived areas of @entity187 's @entity186 in 2005 , and signing a gas deal with @entity189 in 2007 that funded cut - price bus fares for a quarter of a million of the @entity194 capital 's poorest residents			0
in the more nuanced @entity89 era , @entity1 cut a less assured and less influential figure , particularly as his health problems forced him to step back from the limelight			2
his longstanding willingness to seek common cause with any regime also at odds with the @entity204 -- @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 among them -- also came with considerable cost for his credibility , most notably in his enduring loyalty to late @entity213 leader @entity212			0
the world reacts at home , too , @entity1 's scorecard remained blotted by the chronic failure to tackle the violent crime that make @entity14 one of the world 's most dangerous cities , by complaints about press freedom and economic mismanagement , and by the gradual blurring of elements of grassroots participatory democracy with a less savory streak of populist authoritarianism			1
ultimately though , any judgment of @entity1 's merits and failings will largely come down to political taste , with enough evidence to make for compelling argument on both sides			0
what is not in question is the formidable force of personality and political skill that enabled him to unite and hold together a broad leftist alliance always bubbling below the surface with ideological idiosyncrasies and internal divisions , and of the deeply personal bond of loyalty that @entity1 commanded among the millions who made up his red t - shirted chavista power base			1
whether that coalition holds together in the absence of the charismatic individual that forged it , and what replaces it if it fractures , may be the fundamental question that shapes @entity6 's @entity259 future			0
