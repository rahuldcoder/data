@entity0 -- two nongovernmental organizations that worked primarily on promoting democracy abroad were shuttered by the government of the @entity5 this week			1
the @entity7 office of @entity9 - based @entity8 was shut down wednesday , followed by the closure of the @entity0 office of @entity12 , an organization based in @entity13 , the next day			0
both pro-democracy groups saw their offices raided and shut down last year in @entity16			2
@entity16 authorities accused the organizations of international interference that was stoking continued protests against the current military - led government			2
according to the @entity8 , while the organization has a regional office in @entity7 , it does not have any programs in the @entity5			1
" our office was simply a regional hub which supported programs in places like @entity35 and @entity36 , " said @entity27 , @entity8 regional director for the @entity28 and @entity29			0
@entity27 said that authorities -- he 's not sure from where -- came to their office and announced that @entity8 's license was canceled , effective immediately			0
" while we are disappointed at this turn of events and disturbed by the arbitrary behavior in @entity7 , we do not have programs in the @entity5 , so it has no serious ramifications for our work , " he said			1
the @entity13 organization , described as a think tank associated with @entity13 chancellor @entity51 's @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , reacted with even more surprise			0
" we can only react with utter disbelief to the unexpected and sudden developments in @entity0			0
we have not been given any viable reasons			0
" after the experiences in @entity16 , we not only regret this decision			0
we would see it as an alarming signal if nongovernmental organizations and political foundations are not welcome in the @entity65 world , " said @entity58 , head of the @entity59			0
@entity5 officials have not yet commented on the closures			1
@entity9 secretary of state @entity68 , who is in the region , said saturday she regretted the @entity5 decision			1
" we are ... strong believers in a vibrant civil society , and both @entity8 and the @entity12 office play a key role in supporting @entity74 and civil society across the region , and i expect our discussions on this issue to continue			0
" meanwhile , press freedom group @entity79 on friday condemned the government of the @entity5 for cracking down on bloggers and other online activists			1
" march has seen a wave of arrests , attacks and acts of intimidation			0
we urge the government to abandon these methods , " the group said			1
" the authorities must stop arresting ' netizens ' and bloggers for what they post online and must guarantee their safety			2
" human rights groups of late have also stepped up their criticism of the @entity5			1
according to @entity100 , @entity28 researcher for @entity101 , at least three online activists have been detained in recent weeks			1
" it seems that the government is still frighted by the events transpiring in the @entity28 and are trying to do what it takes to keep the @entity107 from reaching its shore , regardless of how small that possibility might be , " he said			2
unlike many other nations in the region , the @entity5 was never affected by @entity107 inspired protests			1
nonetheless , the government has been quick to pursue activists who call for reform			1
last year , the citizenship of seven activists -- known as @entity5 7 -- was revoked by @entity5			1
the seven pro-democracy activists with ties to @entity122 groups were found to be a threat to national security			2
also last year , five activists were arrested , tried and convicted for publicly insulting top @entity5 officials , committing acts that pose a threat to state security , undermining public order , opposing the government system and instigating others to break laws			1
@entity5 president @entity134 pardoned all five one day after they were sentenced to prison terms			1
according to @entity100 , there was hope that the pardoning of the five activists last year was a signal of change to come , but that has not been he case , he said			2
" these recent arrests are just a continuation of attempts by the authorities to silence critics and other dissenting voices , " said @entity143			0
@entity150 , an engineer and blogger , was one of the five prosecuted activists			2
" i strongly disagree and condemn any acts that violate the basic human rights and freedom of opinion and expression , " @entity150 told @entity1			0
" the latest arrests and harassment of activists are directly related to the exercising of these basic rights			2
" @entity150 said the government is worried about the ripple effect of the @entity107			0
" this crackdown does not help anybody ; not the social peace and unity nor the country image in the international level			0
" @entity170 reported from @entity0 ; @entity171 reported from @entity172 .			0
