-- what would happen if you posted derogatory comments about your boss on a @entity6 page that you knew would be read by your co-workers ? how would your boss react if in those @entity6 posts you called him or her a " coward , " a " domestic enemy , " and boasted that you would n't be following the boss ' instructions in the future ? and what if your boss is the president of the @entity16 and you are a sergeant in the @entity17 ? that 's essentially the case of sgt. @entity20 , a nine - year veteran of the @entity17 , who is on the verge of being discharged from the military for making comments on @entity6 about his boss : the commander - in - chief , president @entity26			1
@entity20 posted comments on both his personal @entity6 page and on the @entity30 facebook page he created , mocking the president			1
on those pages he referred to president @entity26 as a " domestic enemy , " a coward , and even superimposed president @entity26 's face on the poster for the movie " @entity40			2
" but the comment that really drew the ire of @entity17 brass was this post from @entity20 : " as an @entity45 i say ' @entity46 ' and i will not follow all orders from him ... has [ sic ] for saluting @entity26 as commander - in - chief ... i will not ! " it 's pretty clear that @entity20 will not be adding president @entity26 as a friend on @entity6 any time soon			1
the @entity16 military has alleged that @entity20 's postings violated military regulations prohibiting partisan political statements while in active service in the military			1
consequently , @entity20 was charged with conduct " prejudicial to good order and discipline			2
" but @entity20 does n't see it that way			1
@entity20 appeared earlier this week on @entity0 's " @entity63 " arguing that the @entity6 posts were not his views as a @entity17 , but , " ... my personal opinion as @entity20			1
" members of the military are free to give their personal opinions about political candidates , but @entity20 's @entity6 post begins : " as an @entity45 i say ' @entity46 ... ' " this clearly gives the appearance that @entity20 is speaking as a member of the @entity17			1
secondly , the @entity17 motto is the @entity77 phrase " @entity78 , " which means " always faithful			0
" the motto is n't " faithful only nine to five			2
" every marine i have ever met has made it clear that being a @entity17 is a 24 - hour a day job			0
bottom line : @entity20 , upon enlisting , agreed to follow the rules of the @entity86 , which contain express regulations prohibiting certain partisan political speech			2
as a result of his apparent violations of these regulations , a military panel ruled last week three to zero to discharge @entity20 from the military			2
in normal times , this case would have likely received little media coverage			0
but these are not normal times			0
instead , we live in a grotesquely partisan era			0
consequently , three @entity100 congressmen publicly came to @entity20 's defense : reps			1
@entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
@entity105 even sent a personal letter to the @entity17 in which he stated in part : " i urge the @entity17 to withdraw the discharge proceedings and allow @entity110 to complete his enlistment			0
" @entity103 , a former @entity112 officer , issued a statement paradoxically conceding that @entity20 should face some form of discipline -- although less than discharge -- but then in essence pointed his finger at president @entity26 as the cause for @entity20 's conduct : " if @entity16 had leadership that gained the respect of our military , instead of simply using them as stage props for speeches , this atmosphere would not exist			1
" adding to the growing partisanship of this case is that the lawyer now representing @entity20 -- @entity133 -- was one of the lead organizers of the birther movement , which contended falsely that president @entity26 was not born in @entity16 and , thus , not legitimately the president			1
@entity133 even created a 28 - minute infomercial on the birther issue in which he hawked " got a @entity141 " bumper stickers for $ 30 each			0
you have to wonder if @entity20 had made the comments at issue about a @entity100 president if these men would be offering the same support			1
( it 's a rhetorical question : we all know the answer			0
) inserting partisan politics into our military is dangerous			2
our nation 's military can not be divided into political factions where loyalty is based on whether service members agree with the political views of the commander - in - chief			0
as the @entity16 @entity159 noted when upholding restrictions on partisan politics in the military : we live under " ... the @entity16 constitutional tradition of a politically neutral military establishment under civilian control			0
" there should be zero tolerance by the military for any partisan politicking by active duty service men or women			0
this is not only " prejudicial to good order and discipline , " but could lead to the loss of lives			0
we already have one dysfunctional institution marred by partisan infighting -- the @entity177 - we ca n't afford another			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

a @entity45 is facing dismissal for his *anti-obama* posts on @entity6
sgt. @entity20 said he would n't follow orders from @entity26 or salute him
@entity181 : military requires obedience , ca n't be *subjected* to partisanship
he says three @entity100 congressmen are out of bounds for backing the @entity45
