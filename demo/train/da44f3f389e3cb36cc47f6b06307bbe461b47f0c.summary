@entity1 , @entity0 -- imagine every time you closed your curtains , you were capturing enough solar energy to power your laptop			1
the technology is available , but no one 's packaged it up in a handy @entity12 kit at your local hardware store			0
solar textiles use the same technology as traditional solar panels to convert sunlight into energy			1
@entity19 hopes to be the first			0
she 's not an interior designer but an architect and professor in practice at the @entity25 who is convinced that solar textiles will revolutionize the way we collect and consume power			1
" i 've been thinking about what happens when power and light become flexible , literally flexible , " she said			2
she calls it " soft power , " as in the " soft energy path , " a term coined @entity37 in the 1970s as a way to describe a world where renewable energy would gradually replace the centralized grid			2
later , @entity42 used the term " soft power " to describe the ability of persuasion , values and culture to influence change			2
@entity19 's work with soft power builds on both of these ideas			2
for her , soft power is the ability of flexible materials to convert sunlight into energy			1
" the soft power approach says there are some incredibly sensual , compelling , beautiful spaces and products that we can be producing using these emerging energy - harvesting materials , " @entity19 said			1
her @entity62 - based firm , @entity61 , has been working with thin - film photovoltaic material , a fabric that looks and moves like cloth but does the job of a solar panel			1
" these are materials which can be prepared in the chemistry lab or can be found in nature			0
they produce electricity when exposed to light			2
they are very efficient and flexible , " she said			2
" we are pairing the thin - film photovoltaic material with another semi-conductor material , the light - emitting diode ; they 're two sides of the same coin			0
one takes a little bit of the energy of sunlight and transforms it into electricity ; some takes that electricity and turns it into light			0
" rechargeable batteries pocketed into the hem of the curtains gather energy that can be downloaded into a larger home battery			1
" from a technical view , the thin - film has the potential to be produced in very high volumes , with a very low embodied energy and a low carbon footprint			0
these new photovoltaic materials can be produced in the same way one might print and produce a newspaper , roll to roll			0
that can make it very affordable , " @entity19 said			0
its limitations are its performance			0
it 's less efficient that glass - based solar technology , but @entity19 predicts that 's going to change			1
" right now there 's research being done on developing sensitivities in thin - film that will allow the energy to continue to be harvested , even at night			0
that 's going to revolutionize the applications for solar textiles , " she said			0
the current technology can be found hanging in the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity123 , in a prototype pre-fabricated home called the @entity125			1
farther south and west , the designers are taking their ideas from the @entity125 and applying them to a research project for a @entity130			1
@entity19 and her team have calculated that by covering just 10 percent of a roof area in @entity135 , @entity136 , solar curtains could provide as much as 70 percent of the average electricity used by a typical household each day			1
" it goes to show that you do n't need a very large area			0
we 've calculated that 15 square meters would be enough			0
" @entity19 envisions a future in which a single homeowner or a group of neighbors would decide to wean themselves off the centralized grid and power their homes using the energy they 've " harvested " themselves from the sun. " you could look at it as a type of urban farming , " @entity19 suggested , adding that one of the reasons people are n't doing it now is not the lack of technology but old habits and inherited centralized building systems in architecture			1
" instead of tucking way electricity and lights in walls and accessing that with a plug , we have the possibility of thinking of a whole new experience for energy , energy - harvesting and for light			1
" she talks about material that you could reel in from the roof and wrap around to make a new type of instant room , a @entity181			0
plastic wall plugs would cease to exist ; instead you 'd harness your appliance into the surface or edge of the textile			0
her ideas may seem radical to homeowners who do n't give much thought to where their power comes from or how much it costs , which is why @entity19 is so keen to see the solar curtains in consumer - friendly packs on hardware store shelves			1
" energy - harvesting solar textiles are a very good beginning point			1
i think that the notion of tying in a new technology with something very familiar really has its advantages if one 's about large - scale uptake and widespread adoption of a new energy regime			0
" regime may sound like a hard word to be used in the context of soft power , but as @entity19 says , it 's up to architects and designers to convince homeowners that there are more efficient alternatives to traditional homes			1
her firm is going one step further with the offer to work with developers and manufacturers who are interested in building digitally fabricated @entity125 demonstration projects			2
" my team is actively interested in speaking to people who are serious about realizing a pilot program that adapts the @entity125 model to actual needs on urban or rural sites			2
i do think the moment is now			0

solar - harvesting curtains could convert sunlight into power source for homes
rechargeable batteries slot into hem , power downloaded to larger battery
cheap to produce but not as efficient as traditional hard solar panels
