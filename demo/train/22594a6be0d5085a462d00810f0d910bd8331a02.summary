-- as regulations tighten in @entity3 and the world 's wealth moves to @entity6 , @entity1 is tipped to overtake @entity7 to become the largest global offshore wealth center in terms of assets by 2020 , according to @entity12 research firm , @entity11			1
although @entity7 easily retains its offshore banking crown with $ 2.8 trillion in assets under management , or 34 % of the global private banking industry , @entity1 is now the world 's fastest growing market with $ 550 billion under management at the end of 2011 , up from just $ 50 billion in 2000			1
with $ 450 billion belonging to offshore clients , @entity1 has grown to become the fourth largest offshore banking center globally			1
the @entity22 and @entity23 is the world 's second largest hub with $ 1.8 trillion under management at the end of 2011 , followed by the @entity27 and @entity28 with $ 800 million			0
a loss of confidence among wealthy @entity33 and @entity3 investors in bank secrecy laws and independence in traditional banking hubs , combined with increasingly stringent banking regulations , are playing in @entity1 's favor , analysts say			1
" a lot of the benefits of being in @entity7 have fallen away in terms of secrecy , therefore if you look at a convenient market , particularly for a wealthy @entity6 individual , @entity1 fits the bill , " said @entity39 , a bank analyst with @entity40			1
" it 's got a stable government , transparent legal system , a history of investment management , having @entity54 as the first language is really very helpful and therefore it 's the obvious place to go to			0
" the increasing numbers of wealthy @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 are helping fuel the shift to low - tax @entity6 centers , according to the report , with @entity65 in a strong position to benefit from the @entity58 government 's moves to free - up international trade in @entity58 's yuan and the growing number of @entity58 millionaires looking for a safe place to invest their money			2
@entity3 currency movements have also contributed to the shift , with the value of the @entity78 rising more than 20 % against the @entity33 dollar last year due to ongoing concerns over @entity3 's debt crisis			0
" the @entity3 crisis undoubtedly has had a big impact on @entity7 because all the @entity3 nations now are looking to get back as much as tax as they possibly can from anywhere , and anyone , " said @entity39			0
" we 've seen @entity7 fall away as a secret cross border location and just become somewhere which is convenient to put your money with a reasonably good tax rate			0
" many investors in the @entity6 markets prefer to invest offshore for risk diversification , or are forced to look overseas due to a lack of experienced and reputable wealth managers in their home markets , according to the report			2
assets under management in @entity1 could quadruple by 2016 as a result , while offshore assets in @entity7 bank accounts are predicted fall by nearly a third to below $ 2 trillion in the next three years			2
