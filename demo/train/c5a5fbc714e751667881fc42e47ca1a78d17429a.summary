@entity0 -- the @entity0 @entity2 voted unanimously thursday to end military operations in @entity4			1
the council adopted a resolution that rescinded its march mandate for military intervention in @entity4 , effectively ending the @entity10 mission there as of monday			1
meanwhile , @entity12 officials said that 24 seriously wounded @entity4 fighters will be taken saturday to @entity14 in @entity15 , and six critically wounded fighters will be taken to @entity17 for @entity12 medical care there			1
their wounds ca n't be treated in @entity4 , officials said			2
the @entity12 medical treatment was requested by @entity4 's @entity21 and is being offered as a humanitarian gesture and support for @entity4 's democratic aspirations , @entity12 officials said			2
@entity4 's interim leaders declared their nation liberated last sunday after the capture and killing of deposed dictator @entity29			1
@entity30 , the @entity12 ambassador to the @entity0 , commended the @entity10 mission as putting @entity4 on a path to freedom but tempered her remarks with a word of caution			1
" we 're very concerned that , as we move forward , that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of @entity4 society , and in which the rights of all @entity4 people are fully and thoroughly respected , regardless of their gender , their religion , their region of origin , " @entity37 said			0
" but for the @entity12 , and , i think , for the @entity0 @entity2 , this closes what i think history will judge to be a proud chapter in the @entity2 's history			2
" @entity58 foreign secretary @entity57 described the @entity2 passage of @entity60 as " another significant milestone towards a peaceful , democratic future for @entity4			0
ending the no - fly zone and the civilian protection provisions demonstrates that @entity4 has entered a new era			0
" the @entity67 ambassador called it a completion of a mission to prevent @entity29 from slaughtering his own people			0
" during the seven months that have followed , we have seen dramatic events where the @entity4 people have succeeded to free themselves with the support of @entity10 , " said @entity72			2
meanwhile , @entity29 's family will file a war crimes complaint with the @entity79 against @entity10 , a lawyer representing the family said thursday			1
members of the family believe @entity10 's actions led to @entity29 's death last week , said @entity86			1
" all of the events that have taken place since february 2011 and the murder of @entity29 , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the @entity79 , " @entity86 said			0
the @entity79 had previously issued a warrant for @entity29 's arrest , accusing him of crimes against humanity			1
it still has warrants out for the arrest of @entity29 's son , @entity101 , and his brother - in - law and intelligence chief , @entity103			1
questions have been raised about how @entity29 was killed			0
amateur videos showed him alive when captured by the opposition			0
he died from a shot in the head , officials said , but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear			0
@entity86 said the @entity29 family 's complaint will be filed in the coming days			1
" now we will wait and see if the @entity79 is a judicial system which is independent and impartial , " he added			0
@entity10 's @entity4 campaign began in march , after the @entity2 adopted @entity117 , which imposed a no - fly zone in the country 's airspace and authorized member states " to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country ... while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of @entity4 territory			1
" there were no opposing votes on the 15 - member council , but @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity17 , @entity136 and @entity137 abstained			0
@entity17 said it was concerned about a protracted military conflict			0
the resolution became the basis for @entity10 's airstrikes in the @entity144 nation			2
in ending the mandate thursday , the @entity2 expressed concern at the proliferation of arms in @entity4 and said it intends to address that issue further			0
the resolution also expressed " grave concern about continuing reports of reprisals , arbitrary detentions , wrongful imprisonment and extrajudicial executions			0
" last week , @entity12 admiral @entity157 , commander of @entity10 's military forces , recommended that @entity10 wrap up its mission in @entity4 by october 31			1
@entity10 ministers gave preliminary approval to that plan			0
but @entity12 defense secretary @entity163 said this week that @entity4 's @entity21 wanted @entity10 to stick around until it could establish governance			2
however , @entity4 deputy ambassador @entity165 told the 15 - member council wednesday that the @entity4 people were looking forward to ending the @entity10 mission			1
while @entity4 were grateful for the international community 's support , he said , such measures felt like an infringement on @entity4 's sovereignty .			2

24 injured @entity4 fighters will be treated in @entity15 ; 6 more , in @entity17
@entity29 's family will file a complaint against @entity10
thursday 's @entity0 resolution ends the @entity10 mission as of monday
