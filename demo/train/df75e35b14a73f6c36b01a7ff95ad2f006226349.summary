@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 on saturday heightened its threats against upcoming @entity6 - supported military exercises after talks over the sinking of a @entity10 warship			1
@entity3 " will legitimately counter with [ its ] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest - ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the @entity6 and the @entity10 puppet forces , " the state - run @entity12 news agency said			1

" there will be a physical response against the threat imposed by the @entity6 militarily , " @entity3 spokesman @entity30 said outside the @entity32 meeting in @entity0 , @entity1			2
two @entity6 military officials told there was no sign of significant troop movement in @entity3			1
why are the two @entity40 so hostile ? about 8,000 military personnel from the @entity6 and @entity10 are scheduled to participate in the joint military exercises			1
meanwhile friday , in the demilitarized zone between the two @entity40 , officers from the @entity3 sat down for talks about the @entity24 incident with their counterparts in the @entity6 - led @entity48			2
during the almost two - hour meeting in the international truce town of @entity51 , the @entity48 reminded the @entity3 of the @entity53 's condemnation this month of the @entity24 attack			0
the @entity53 did not mention @entity3 by name but condemned the attack strongly , called for " full adherence " to the armistice agreement that halted fighting in the @entity60 in 1953 and encouraged " the settlement of outstanding issues on the @entity63 by peaceful means			1
" an international inquiry found @entity3 culpable for the march attack that killed 46 @entity10 sailors			1
but @entity3 denies a role in the incident , which elevated tension between the two enemies			0
@entity3 demanded again friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the @entity24 's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext			0
" the @entity6 forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [ @entity3 ] through large - scale war exercises , " the state - run @entity12 news agency said			0
" it should immediately stop the [ @entity81 ] nuclear war racket			0
" " [ this ] double - dealing attitude is a dangerous one of driving the situation on the @entity63 to a war phase , " @entity12 said			0
at the @entity32 meeting , nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the @entity10			0
the @entity6 has accused @entity3 of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions wednesday			2

later , after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the @entity101 , @entity97 said the door remains open for dialogue if @entity3 commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program			1
" we would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of @entity10 have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years , " @entity97 said			1
" so , it is distressing when @entity3 continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region			0
" @entity30 described the planned @entity6 - @entity10 joint military exercise as " another example of a hostile policy " against @entity3			1
" it is a grave threat to the @entity63 and also to the region of @entity94 as a whole , " he said			0

the exercises are to take place in the @entity135 on @entity10 's east coast and the @entity137 on the west coast , according to a joint @entity6 and @entity10 statement			2
@entity140 has objected to war games in the @entity137 , so close to its coastline			0
and that is what bothers @entity3 as well , said a @entity146 professor who returned two weeks ago from his 52nd trip to @entity26			0
" i think it 's a bad idea , " said @entity148 , who helped arrange former president @entity150 's visit to @entity3 in 1994 and is the only @entity6 to have visited the rogue nation since the @entity24 incident			1
@entity148 said the @entity6 should never underestimate the resolve of the @entity3 military , one that is further emboldened now by @entity140 opposition to the military drills			1
" i will hold my breath if this takes place anywhere near the west coast , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
