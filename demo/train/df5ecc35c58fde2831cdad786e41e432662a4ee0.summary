-- common @entity2 superstition says friday the 13th is unlucky			1
but what does it say about a friday the 13th with a full moon and solar flares that could create geomagnetic storms large enough to disrupt @entity10 's atmosphere ? we may find out this friday			1
@entity13 cameras captured three major solar flares this week -- events in which the sun hurls powerful bursts of matter into the atmosphere			1
when large enough , these bursts send shock waves -- called coronal mass ejections , or @entity23 -- throughout space			2
these shock waves pose no direct threat to humans , but sometimes , on days such as june 13 , @entity27 can be large enough to disrupt @entity28 , satellite communications and other atmospheric systems , according to @entity13			2
" a cme ... has been observed moving at a flank from @entity10 and a glancing blow to @entity10 from this event is expected on june 13 , " said the @entity32 in a statement			1
" an outside chance of at most @entity39 ( @entity40 ) geomagnetic storms remains in the forecast			2
" translation : despite the ominous " glancing blow " language , there 's no reason to be alarmed			2
the disruption of communication systems in the atmosphere is still unlikely , even with the impending solar storms			1
people in remote areas of the @entity54 may even get a light show friday night			0
some scientists believe the storms will produce brightly colored auroras visible in the night sky , although others disagree			1
either way , it 's been awhile since we 've seen such as an event			0
the last major @entity34 to hit @entity10 came in 1859			1
@entity65 , curator of @entity66 , analyzed the last 17 friday the 13ths " for fun " in response to a @entity0 request			0
he concluded that friday 's solar - related activity was an outlier			1
" of course , there is no actual correlation between solar flares and friday the 13th , " he said in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" ( @entity76 ) today ... is shaping up to be the most active of the past 10 years , albeit not by a wide margin			0
friday the 13th in may 2005 was similar			2
" @entity65 , who is also production editor for science at @entity13 , categorized only four friday the 13ths in the last decade as " high solar activity			2
" thus , @entity32 remains on watch			0
according to its website , " forecasters are keeping a close eye on the @entity84 and we will update you should conditions warrant it			0
" solar activity varies in its intensity , but there has been an uptick in solar flares and related episodes in recent years			1
this is not a surprise			0
this week , @entity13 released a statement dubbing this new solar activity a natural occurrence and part of the star 's cycle of life			1
they called it a " mini- max. " because , historically speaking , it 's not that bad			0
" this solar cycle continues to rank among the weakest on record , " said @entity13 adviser @entity109 in a post online			0
" in the historical record , there are only a few @entity115 weaker than this one			0
" he has a point			0
in all likelihood , the @entity10 's atmosphere , satellite systems and humans all will remain unaffected by the solar flares and their corresponding @entity124			1
well , maybe we are lucky after all .			0

solar flares this week are sending storms @entity10 's way
scientists say it 's unlikely humans will see effects
storms , full moon *converging* above @entity10 this friday the 13th
@entity140 scientists are *monitoring* situation , will send alerts if necessary
