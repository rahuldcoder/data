-- a pint - sized version of the @entity2 , with similarly powerful legs , razor - sharp teeth and tiny arms , roamed @entity6 some 125 million years ago , said scientists who remain startled by the discovery			1
an adult @entity11 was about 9 feet tall and weighed about 150 pounds , scientists say			1
the predator , nicknamed @entity11 , lived about 60 million years before the @entity2 and was slightly larger than the human male , scientists said			1
the findings , to be released friday in the journal @entity17 , are based on fossilized remains discovered in lake beds in northeastern @entity6			1
they show a dinosaur with many of the specialized physical features of @entity2 at a fraction of its size			0
" the most interesting and important thing about this new fossil is that it is completely unexpected , " said @entity27 , co-author of the article , in a conference call with reporters			0
" it 's becoming harder and harder to find fossils like this that totally throw us for a curve , " added @entity27 , a paleontologist with the @entity33			0
scientists who have studied the fossilized animal , which was 5 to 6 years old when it died , believe it was an ancestor of the fearsome @entity2			2
" @entity11 really is a pivotal moment in the history of the group where most of the biological meaningful features about @entity48 came into being , " said lead author @entity42 , a paleontologist at the @entity43			0
" and the surprising fact is that they came into being in such a small animal , " he added			0
based on estimates of other similar - sized theropods , or " beast - footed " dinosaurs , @entity42 and his colleagues estimate an adult @entity11 was about 9 feet tall and weighed about 143 pounds			1
by contrast , the @entity2 , which topped the prehistoric food chain until dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago , was believed to weigh at least five tons			1
scientists hypothesize that @entity11 ran its prey down , using its enlarged skull , powerful jaws and sharp teeth to dispatch animals much larger than itself			0
like the @entity2 , the @entity11 also had tiny forelimbs , they said			2
" we can say that these features did not evolve as a consequence of large body size but rather evolved as an efficient set of predatory weapons in an animal that was 1/100th the size of @entity2 and that lived 60 million years before @entity2 , " @entity27 said			1
after the remains were discovered , they were smuggled out of @entity6 and into the @entity77 , where they were eventually purchased by a @entity80 collector , @entity79 , who donated them to science			2
@entity42 was later asked to identify the fossil			0
" i hope that this is a pathway that other important specimens that do find their way out of the ground in the dark of night do not get lost to science , " @entity42 said			0
the @entity11 fossil will eventually be returned to @entity6 , where it will be put on display near the excavation site , scientists said .			2
