@entity0 , @entity1 -- the trial of former @entity6 - area police sgt. @entity4 , accused of killing his ex-wife , focused wednesday on an incident in which he allegedly had threatened to kill her with a knife			1
defense attorneys sought to discredit @entity13 's account of the july 2002 incident , in which she had said @entity4 pushed her down the stairs of her home , upset about their divorce proceedings , and told her to turn her head so he could kill her			1
@entity4 , 58 , is on trial , charged with the murder of @entity21 , his third wife , who was found dead in her dry , clean bathtub march 1 , 2004			1
a classic case of domestic violence ? the case did not arise until after @entity4 's fourth wife , @entity27 , went missing in october 2007			1
it was during the search for @entity30 , who has never been found , that investigators said they would look again at @entity21 's death , which was initially ruled a drowning			1
@entity21 's death was ruled a homicide in february 2008 , and @entity4 was later arrested and indicted on first - degree murder			1
the court heard wednesday afternoon from the forensic pathologist who conducted the second autopsy that led to the homicide ruling			1
@entity4 has been called a suspect in @entity30 's disappearance , though he has never been charged in that case			1
wednesday morning 's testimony began with the cross-examination of @entity46 , @entity1 , police lt. @entity47 , who took a police report from @entity21 about the alleged knife incident in 2002			1
prosecutors examined @entity47 on tuesday			0
@entity21 had written in the police report that @entity4 pushed her down the stairs and told her not to get up , then told her how " awful and bitchy " she was and that she should stop being so terrible to him			1
@entity21 had written that she grew tired of his rant , so she told him , " ' go ahead , just kill me			0
' he said , ' where do you want it ? ' and i said , ' in the head			0
' he said , ' ok , then turn your head , ' and i did it			0
and then he said that he would never be able to hurt me			0
" @entity47 testified that @entity21 told her verbally that @entity4 threatened her with a knife , but that she did n't include it when she wrote her statement			1
" i told her to put in the report what happened			0
i said , ' the knife part is n't in here			2
you need to put in here what actually happened , ' " @entity47 testified			0
" then she wrote it in there , and a short time later she crossed the knife part out			2
she expressed concern about him being arrested and losing his job			0
" defense attorney @entity77 noted the incident is alleged to have happened july 5 , 2002 , but that @entity21 did n't call @entity47 to make the report until july 18			2
he also pointed out that @entity4 had served @entity21 with a criminal complaint just " 10 or 15 minutes " before she filed the police report , but that she never mentioned that to @entity82			1
is the defense team too confident ? @entity21 had told @entity47 that after @entity4 left she immediately called several people , including friend and neighbor @entity86 , and told them about the knife incident			1
but according to @entity77 , @entity86 said @entity21 described only a " nice conversation " with her husband			0
that description was " consistent " with what @entity4 told @entity47 when she interviewed him about the incident , @entity77 said			1
@entity47 ended her testimony by saying she was n't sure whether @entity21 was telling the truth about @entity4 wielding a knife			1
" you had some concerns about whether that actually happened ? " @entity77 asked			0
" yes , " @entity47 replied			0
" and that was based on your complete investigation ? " he asked			0
" yes , " @entity47 said			0
the afternoon session of the trial was expected to include testimony by the doctor who performed @entity21 's second autopsy , and by @entity106 , @entity30 's friend			2
in the afternoon , the court heard from dr. @entity108 , who performed the autopsy on @entity111 's body after she was exhumed in 2007			1
@entity108 testified that @entity21 suffered a laceration to the back of her scalp , which led to dried blood on her face and around the drain when she was found			0
he said it would have been " impossible " for the blood to have dried like that had there been water in the tub			0
he also testified that @entity111 had a number of fresh bruises -- less than an hour old -- on the front of her body , including to her hip bones , thigh , shins , and hands			1
@entity108 said he also found a fresh abrasion on her buttocks that " would not be consistent with someone 's slip and fall			0
" he did not testify about why the first autopsy would have ruled her death accidental			1
the @entity4 trial began july 31 and is expected to last about four weeks			1
repeated missteps by the prosecution are angering judge @entity143 and the defense			1
at least four times since the trial began , prosecutors have allowed witnesses to testify to details @entity143 has told them not to go into -- such as whether @entity21 had a protective order against her husband or allowing @entity108 to demonstrate climbing into the bathtub			2
in some cases the defense has sought a mistrial and in others they have asked the judge to strike entire testimony			2
@entity143 has instead ordered the jury to disregard elements of the testimony that went against his orders			0
" the disrespect to the court is shocking , " @entity143 told the prosecution wednesday			0
@entity4 was married to @entity21 in 2001 when he had an affair with then - 17 - year - old @entity166 , whom he would later marry			2
@entity21 and @entity4 filed for divorce in october 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years			2
@entity46 police records indicate officers were called to @entity21 's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004			0
@entity4 had @entity21 arrested twice for domestic violence , though she was found not guilty in both cases			2
@entity21 's order of protection on february 27 , 2004 , @entity4 picked up his two sons from @entity21 's home , spending the next two days with them			2
prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on february 29 and killed @entity21			0
at the time of her death , which authorities initially treated as an accident , a court was mulling how the couple 's marital assets would be divided , and @entity21 was set to receive part of @entity4 's pension and other support			1
the defense contends @entity21 fell accidentally , hit her head , and drowned			0
in @entity199 's @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
