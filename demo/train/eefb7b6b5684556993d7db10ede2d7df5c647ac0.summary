-- the kind of insect evidence found by investigators in the trunk of @entity8 's car does not prove that a body was stored inside , a bug expert for the defense testified friday in the @entity12 woman 's murder trial			1
prosecutors used their cross-examination to vigorously challenge forensic entomologist @entity15 on his experience , an experiment on a pig and why he omitted a key opinion on a stain photo from his pretrial report			1
jurors previously heard from prosecution witnesses who testified that the discovery of one leg of a kind of fly commonly found around decomposing bodies , as well as more numerous examples of a different kind of fly , suggested that a body had been stored in the trunk for no more than three to five days			1
prosecutors allege that @entity35 killed her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity8 , and stored her body in the trunk before dumping it in a wooded field in june 2008			1
prosecution witnesses have testified about a subtle stain and a strong odor inside the car as evidence that a body had been decomposing inside the trunk			1
but on friday , @entity15 told jurors that the evidence is not convincing			2
" in my opinion , one leg of a blow fly does n't mean anything , " said the @entity49 ( @entity50 ) faculty member			1
the other insects found in the trunk , phorid flies , are frequently found in household garbage and are not as closely tied to human decomposition , he said			1
@entity15 questioned the relative dearth of flies found in @entity35 's trunk , describing experiments he conducted with freshly killed pigs placed in a closed trunk and left to rot			1
he said the experiment revealed heavy insect infestation and significant staining from fluids leaking from the pig 's body , even in weather cooler than that of the @entity75 summer			1
prosecutor @entity76 also asked whether @entity15 had experimented with encasing a pig 's body in a blanket , two trash bags and a laundry bag , which is how prosecutors claim @entity8 's body was disposed			1
@entity15 said he had not tried that			2
he also said the pig study had nothing to do with the @entity35 case			2
" i would have handled it very differently " and replicated circumstances in the @entity35 case if he knew he was going to testify , @entity15 said			2
the nation 's youngest board - certified forensic entomologist told jurors that from looking at a photo , he did not believe a stain found in the liner of the trunk came from human decomposition			0
but @entity76 got @entity15 to admit that he has never previously made such an opinion in a courtroom and was never qualified as an expert on such identification			1
@entity15 told jurors that he did not include his opinion on the stain in his pretrial report because he focused on insects recovered in the trunk			0
@entity15 said it would be almost impossible to clean up decomposition fluids , especially not with paper towels -- a reference to testimony by a prosecution witness that fly - ridden paper towels inside a garbage bag in the trunk appeared to have been smeared with fluid that could have come from a decomposing body			1
the flies were attracted not to that type of material but rather to spit from chewing tobacco or possibly something inside a salami container found in a trash bag in the trunk , @entity15 said			1
later , he testified that little or no food was found in the trash			0
" it 's a bag of trash with trash - feeding insects in it , " @entity15 said			0
" there 's nothing remarkable about that			0
" i think there was never any reason to think there was a body in the trunk			1
" @entity15 said he had no prior experience with cases involving decomposing bodies in trunks			1
@entity76 also questioned what impact the high levels of chloroform detected in the trunk would have on insects , asking whether it could repel or kill them			0
@entity15 said it seemed unlikely but conceded that he had not studied the issue and that he was unaware of any other scientists who had			0
outside the courtroom , an ex-convict whom defense attorneys say had telephone conversations with @entity35 's father , @entity35 , around the time of @entity8 's disappearance held a brief news conference to say he had nothing to do with the case			2
" i have no idea who @entity35 is			0
i 've only seen him on tv			0
i 've never talked to him			0
" said @entity167 , whose surprise appearance on the defense 's witness list this week has caused ripples			1
@entity35 's defense attorneys claim that @entity167 , a convicted felon who served prison time for kidnapping , is linked to @entity35 's father through cell phone records , including four telephone calls made the day before @entity8 was reported missing			1
the defense said it needs to question @entity167 " to determine the existence of relevant admissible evidence in this trial			1
" @entity167 said he does n't know anything			1
he said he did n't even have the telephone number until february 2009			2
" they dragging me in this for some reason i do n't know , " @entity167 told @entity185 's @entity184			1
" it 's been totally crazy , ma'am , for the last two or three weeks			0
" @entity167 's attorney , @entity189 , said the whole ordeal has been upsetting for his client			1
" it 's just another attempt by @entity8 to try to create some kind of reasonable doubt , " he told @entity184			0
prosecutors allege that @entity35 , 25 , killed @entity8 in 2008 by using chloroform on her , putting duct tape over her nose and mouth , or a combination of the two			0
they allege she then put the little girl 's body in black garbage bags and stored it in her trunk before dumping it in woods near her home			2
@entity35 faces seven counts in @entity8 's death , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and misleading investigators			0
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
she has pleaded not guilty , and her defense attorney has said that when all the facts are known , his client 's innocence will become clear			2
the defense has said @entity8 was not killed but rather drowned in the family pool june 16			2
defense attorney @entity221 told jurors in his opening statements that @entity35 and her father panicked when they discovered the body and covered up her death			1
@entity35 rejected that scenario in his testimony the first week of the trial			2
friday was the second day of the defense case in the trial			2
on thursday , @entity221 questioned @entity233 examiner @entity232 and @entity234 , @entity75 , @entity236 crime scene technician @entity235 , who said that testing found no blood on any of @entity35 's clothes , in her car trunk or in the interior of the car			0
@entity232 also tested three pieces of duct tape found at the scene where @entity8 's remains were recovered , two of them covering the mouth portion of her remains			0
she testified that a dna profile generated on the outside of the tape matched another @entity233 forensic examiner , @entity255			0
testing on the inside of the tape was inconclusive , but a possible indication of dna there did not appear to match @entity8 , @entity8 or @entity35 , she said			0
the trial resumes saturday morning			0
in @entity265 's @entity264 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report			0
