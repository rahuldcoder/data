-- @entity3 's @entity2 bid coup on friday may have the lyrics to " @entity5 " playing on a loop in your head , but it 's still too early to squeeze into a @entity10 bikini -- you ca n't even book a flight to the @entity13 in @entity14 yet			1
@entity3 beat out @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 for the @entity18			1
travel experts said the flame has to go out in one city before moving on to the next			0
the @entity22 have n't yet begun in @entity23 , so if you 're thinking about a trip to @entity14 's july 2012 @entity26 start looking for deals as early as next year , and for @entity3 , you 'll have to wait until 2014			1
" we anticipate that we 'll have packages for @entity14 by april of next year , " said @entity28 , vice president of sales and marketing at tour operator @entity30			1
" the demand in @entity14 will be pretty good because of location , and we 'll be price sensitive because it is an expensive city			1
" as for individual event tickets for the @entity14 games , merchandise is n't expected until 2011 , said @entity41 president @entity40			1
@entity41 and its partnering wholesalers sell the tickets in phases , @entity40 said , starting about 18 months before the @entity46 ' start date			1
for the best selection , sign up for e-mail alerts so you can pre-register in late @entity50 and the company will send you an email when tickets are available for purchase			2
@entity41 also offers packages that include accomodations with event tickets			1
tour companies , on the other hand , place airfare , accommodations for four to five nights , tickets to select events , transportation and translation services , plus a few meals into one neat -- and more expensive -- package			2
many also offer extension tours to other spots in the region , so you can fit in sightseeing as well			2
@entity30 is offering pre-reservations for the @entity46 for those who are dead set on being in @entity14 in july 2012			1
by signing up and plunking down a refundable $ 250 , you can be one of the first to select a travel package , which vary in cost depending on length of stay , airfare and hotel			0
packages for @entity85 ranged from $ 4,000 to more than $ 9,000 , and @entity28 said there 's always an initial rush to purchase as soon as flights and tickets to the host city become available			0
so if you 're so intent on the @entity26 that you 've already planned your vacation days , definitely start researching now , said @entity93 owner @entity92 , who is also pre-reserving customers for 2012 @entity14 trips			1
" the reason why we started so early is because we had a huge interest in @entity14 , " @entity92 said			1
" i thought that 2010 in @entity23 would be a huge interest for people , but coming right off the @entity26 in @entity85 , we already had people asking us what we could do for 2012			0
the response has been very strong , and @entity85 did us some favors by putting on a tremendous show , so the @entity26 is looking very appealing			0
" there 's been so much interest , @entity92 had to limit the number of early reservations			0
" we had close to 400 people for @entity85 , and we brought over a lot of staff and we hired a lot of people on site for translators			0
unfortunately , there 's only so many people that our company can travel			0
[ for @entity14 ] we will have to limit it , because there 's a limited amount of hotel rooms and transportation			1
" accommodations in @entity3 are already causing concern for the tour operators , despite the fact that hotels in the area , like the @entity131 and @entity132 , have barely begun planning for what is sure to be an astronomically large event			1
" we look at the city and see what accomodations are available , " @entity28 said			0
" in @entity85 , bed and breakfasts were n't an option			0
but @entity14 will have plenty of options -- it has the most out of any city i 've worked on			2
[ but ] i think @entity3 is going to be a challenge because there are fewer hotels in @entity3 than @entity14 or @entity85 ; it 'll be a challenge to get adequate accommodations for the event sponsors and the public			1
" it 's also a concern for @entity92 , who 's hoping the @entity152 will help prepare the city for the @entity18			0
" with @entity14 , we have options in surrounding areas , " she said			2
" but in @entity3 , there are a lot of areas that are very rundown ; i 'd be concerned with people booking on their own to book in a place that 's not safe			2
but we do have the @entity152 in 2014 , so maybe by 2016 there 'll be more hotels			2
" @entity163 , a spokesperson with @entity164 , is n't concerned about a lack of accomodations , but does want the @entity14 or @entity3 - bound to know that they 'll have to contain their excitement for a few more years			1
" with @entity14 , right now we 're only taking stuff through october 2010 , " @entity163 said , adding that @entity3 bookings are a long , long way off			1
" but , " he said , " we do have inventory in @entity3 now and we have an office in @entity10 , and we 're always adding new hotels to our network			1
by the time 2016 would rolls around , our hotel network should expand			0
" similarly , airlines do n't sell airfare to either host city until about 11 months beforehand -- for flights to @entity14 for july , 2012 , start looking around june of 2011			1
but for @entity3 , you wo n't be able to book until 2015 at the earliest			2
nonetheless , @entity92 said , " the flight is crucial			0
there are n't a lot of options for @entity3			2
i 'm hoping because of the @entity26 and the @entity152 , they 'll have to open up more air flights , because with fewer flights , that 's how the cost skyrockets			0
" @entity193 , an @entity194 representative , said there is n't a plan to create new flights to the region just yet			0
" generally , that would be done fairly close - in to the event , " @entity193 said			0
" we watch the volume of bookings as they come in and the timing of the travel requests and then add additional flights on specific days and times as necessary			0
" however , he added that " it seems safe to predict we will likely add flights on certain days given our large presence in the @entity10 market			0
" bottom line ? sit tight , sign up for ticket email alerts and go ahead and spring for that @entity10 wax -- even if you are about six years early .			0

planning to go to an @entity2 *destination* should start two years in advance
event tickets are available about 18 months prior to the start date
for the 2012 games in @entity14 , you can pre-reserve tours now
if you 're interested in going to @entity3 in 2016 , you 'll have to wait until after 2012
