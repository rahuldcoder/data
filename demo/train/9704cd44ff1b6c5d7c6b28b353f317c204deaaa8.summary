-- it took a two - year journey around the world for @entity4 to identify her life 's mission -- finding the funny in religion			1
fifteen years ago , pastor @entity4 did n't even go to church			1
she was an attorney for @entity10 , drafting contracts and defending litigation claims			2
after hours , she exercised her natural talent for making people laugh , performing stand - up in small comedy clubs around @entity17			2
but when she went to bed at night , @entity4 felt an absence of purpose : " my parents taught me to leave things better than i found them , " she remembers			1
" i used to lie there and think , what did i leave better today ? " so she quit her job , packed a bag , and set off to find her true calling			2
@entity0 : from ad exec to cheese master " i was raised in a very conservative -- and alienating -- baptist tradition down @entity31 , and that was all i knew , " @entity4 says			1
" i wanted to sink into new religions			0
" so she spent time with a @entity34 family in @entity35 , meditated with @entity37 monks in @entity38 , and visited an imam in @entity40			0
but her turning point came at @entity43 's orphanage in @entity44 , where she met a 5 - year - old deaf child named @entity46			1
sitting in @entity4 's lap , @entity46 put her ear against her chest			1
@entity4 laughed , and @entity46 , feeling the vibrations , squealed with delight			1
" we did this for hours , " says @entity4			1
" it was like @entity55 dropped a sign : ' @entity57 and spirituality go together ! ' " @entity0 : from writer to farmer back in @entity61 , she enrolled in a seminary with the hope that she might use her humor to help people see the divine in a more joyful way			0
since 2000 @entity4 has been a minister at @entity68 , preaching on subjects such as what @entity70 can learn from @entity73 fans ( " they believe the @entity75 lives , honey , and we can all use some of that faith " )			1
last may @entity78 published her first book , " @entity80 "			0
" if you can laugh at yourself , you can forgive yourself , " she says			0
" and if you can forgive yourself , then you can forgive others			0
" @entity0 : from software developer to aerialist when her church schedule permits , @entity4 tours the country with rabbi - slash - comic @entity87 and @entity89 comedian @entity88 using religion as fodder for their act ( " @entity94 do n't talk about sex , " says @entity4			1
" it could lead to dancing			0
