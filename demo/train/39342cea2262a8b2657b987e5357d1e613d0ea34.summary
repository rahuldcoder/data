a technician from the @entity0 will be monitored for three weeks after possibly being exposed to the ebola virus at one of the agency 's @entity5 labs , the @entity0 said wednesday			1

the incident was discovered tuesday			0
the technician has no symptoms of the illness , @entity0 director of public relations @entity18 said in the statement			1
" others who entered the lab have been contacted and will be assessed for possible exposure by the @entity23			1

" that includes destroying the material , decontaminating and closing the lab , letting staff know about the incident and notifying the proper oversight agencies			0
this is not the first incident in which the transfer from one lab to another risked exposure to potentially deadly material			2
in early june , dozens of @entity0 workers were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to inactivate the dangerous bacteria before transferring it to another lab. an outside investigation by the @entity60 @entity59 found dangerous biological materials stored in unlocked refrigerators and a general lack of lab workers following safety protocols			2
investigators said the anthrax that was believed to be deactivated was transferred in @entity69 bags , which are not approved to carry such materials			0
@entity37 , who took the @entity0 director job in 2009 , acknowledged at a congressional hearing into that incident and others that he and other @entity0 managers failed to recognize a " critical pattern			0
