and @entity15 , the guy from " @entity16 , " to video chat on it			1
that was the scene in @entity19 on tuesday as @entity4 and @entity5 co-founder @entity20 announced their new venture , a live video - chatting platform called @entity24			1
the problem ? in the middle of this rich - rapper - plus - rich - internet - tycoon gabfest , @entity24 crashed			2
" glitch after glitch marred @entity24 's first public showing , leaving the event 's collection of celebrities riffing and improvising onstage while engineers tried to fix the bugs and revive dropped connections , " @entity30 's @entity29 wrote from the event			1
" airtime demo = @entity12 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity15 , @entity47 , @entity11 + a million tech problems , " tweeted @entity41 , from @entity42			0
" @entity24 has been about 80 % fail , but , hey , @entity44 is here			2
so it 's all good , " wrote @entity50 's editor - in - chief , @entity51			0
@entity52 was harsher : " to launch his new start - up , @entity4 should have spent less of his billions on celebrity guests and more of it on fixing his technology , " wrote @entity57			1
a botched demonstration , of course , does n't mean that @entity24 is doomed			2
but , based on reviews from tech writers , descriptions of the product and a quick test , there 's something more troubling that could be bad news for @entity68 's shelf life : no one seems to know why people would use it			2
how @entity24 works essentially , @entity24 is a @entity9 - connected , video - chatting platform on crack			1
when you log on at @entity76 you see two video - chat windows , a list of your friends you might want to talk with and a list of topics you might want to talk about			1
if you select a topic -- like tv 's " @entity83 " or other items you may have " liked " on @entity9 -- you will get set up with a video chat with someone else who also likes that show			1
the same goes for location : you can have @entity24 start a random conversation with someone who is on @entity9 and who lives in your geographic area			1
it 's like @entity95 , but you can watch @entity97 clips with someone while you 're engaged in a video chat together			1
which makes it like @entity102 , except it 's attached to a social network that has 900 million active users , giving it potentially more reach			1
if you 're plugged into the tech world , you may recall a website called @entity109 , which hooked people up with strangers online for quick , random video chats			1
that site got lots of buzz on this website and others , but it ultimately flopped because people stopped using it for cross-cultural " @entity120 " exchanges , and started getting naked			0
because @entity24 also lets people chat with strangers , it 's been called the logical , safer successor to @entity109 -- one with more clothes			1
@entity4 's chat program is tied to @entity9 , so it knows your real identity and can ban you in a hurry if you show up for a video discussion sans pants			1
according to this @entity132 report , the site will snap photos of users periodically to ensure that people have their clothes on			2
so that 's how it works			0
but the question remains : do internet users really want to chat with strangers ? and if not , is @entity68 different enough from @entity95 -- a video - chat program that 's already integrated into @entity9 -- to stand out ? @entity142 , or sleaze ? writing at the blog @entity145 , @entity146 explains why the @entity5 alums think people will want to engage in video chats with people they do n't know : " @entity4 and @entity151 argue that they are helping bring serendipity into a world where people 's online social graphs are set			1
@entity24 is a ' social discovery ' application for helping people make new friends online , not necessarily for the purpose of dating			1
" but , she writes , it 's not certain if that 's how people will use the network			1
" it 's unclear if @entity24 will work -- will people want to use it ? " she asks			1
" will it fill up with spammers and skeezy dudes ? is it technically sound ? but what is clear is that there are high expectations for @entity4 and @entity151 's next act			2
" @entity57 , from @entity52 , was more direct : " cool technology or not , the demand for this kind of service has yet to emerge , " he wrote			0
others are more upbeat about the future of random video chats			0
" the excitement of meeting new people with whom you have no ' friends ' in common , only interests , geography or kinks , are probably enough ( to propel the product ) , " @entity180 wrote at @entity132			2
" @entity4 told ( @entity132 writer @entity190 in an interview sunday , ' fun crazy things should happen online			2
let the wild rumpus begin ! ( once the technical glitches are worked out ... ) " @entity195 , meanwhile , also sees potential in random video conferences between strangers , particularly because @entity24 works to set you up with people who have common interests : " when a chat with a stranger is initiated , the service lists both users ' shared interests			1
so , for example , if both users are huge ' @entity207 : the @entity212 ' fans , they could both dive right into discussing the pros and cons of @entity216 's beard			0
interests can be added and removed from within the video chat window			1
this is perfect if your love of ' @entity222 ' has connected you with people who are probably a little too obsessed with the death of @entity225			0
" the blog @entity226 goes so far as to say the program will " re-humanize the @entity228			0
" " one minute into using @entity24 i was laughing with someone i 'd never met , " writes @entity230			0
" that 's something special when despite all the asynchronous connection , the @entity228 threatens to make us feel lonely			0
" my time with @entity24 in my quick test of the network , i had a different experience			2
whereas @entity109 in its early , non-pornographic days felt fun and random , @entity24 felt more stilted			0
it was almost intimidating to enter into chats on @entity24 with strangers who were assumed to have something in common with you			2
that said , i did have a couple of good interactions			0
i talked to one guy about the @entity250 video - gaming conference going on this week			0
he seemed impressed with @entity24 and said it is way better than @entity109			0
but i also chatted with someone who was supposed to be in my geographic area and was n't			0
we did n't have much to talk about , so i started playing that mash - up @entity97 video of @entity257 singing " @entity258			0
" the point , i 'd hoped , was that this might give us something to talk about -- or at least we could sway together			0
my 30 - second friend hung up on me			0
if you go to @entity76 and sign up , let us know what you think in the comments .			0

@entity5 co-founders @entity4 , @entity20 launch social video venture called @entity24
the network is built on top of @entity9
it allows users to chat with friends or people with shared interests
it 's unclear , however , if people want to video chat with strangers
