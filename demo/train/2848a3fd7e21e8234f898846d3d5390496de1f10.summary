@entity0 -- a power company apologized saturday and said the exposure of three workers at the @entity6 power plant to highly radioactive water might have been avoided with better communication			1
the thursday incident has spurred questions about the source of the radioactive contamination in water , its potential to taint seawater nearby and the prospect it might be evidence of a leak in at least one of the facility 's six reactor cores			2
it also prompted further criticism of the @entity22 , which runs the plant , and how well it is safeguarding the nearly 500 people working to prevent more emission of potentially cancerous radioactive materials about two weeks after a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami rocked the facility			2
on march 24 , three workers laying electrical cable in the turbine building of the no. 3 reactor stepped in tainted water , exposing themselves to high levels of radiation			1
two suffered direct exposure on their skin			0
@entity39 , the company 's associate director , said pooled water had been discovered in the basement of the no. 1 reactor six days earlier , but a sample was n't taken for analysis until the 24th , after the workers were exposed			1
the company started draining the water from the no. 1 reactor that evening and has continued draining it ever since , he said			2
plans are also in the works to drain water from the no. 2 and no. 3 reactors			1
such incidents threatened to undermine the public 's trust in @entity22 , @entity60 chief cabinet secretary @entity59 told reporters			1
he added the @entity60 government " would like to give stronger instructions " to the company that it fully disclose as much information as possible about conditions at the plant			2
" every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly " to @entity60 's nuclear and industrial safety agency , @entity59 said			2
" without this communication , it 's very difficult for the government to ( establish ) proper safety measures			2
" as important , the chief secretary said , was the need for @entity22 to be upfront with the @entity60 -- millions of whom get power from the company and millions more of whom have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis			1
" we need to be sure that ( @entity22 ) is n't going to act in a way that will create distrust , " @entity59 said			0
@entity39 told reporters that radiation alarms went off while the three men were working , but they continued with their mission for 40 to 50 minutes after assuming it was a false alarm			0
later , they were hospitalized after it was determined they had been exposed to 173 to 181 millisieverts of radiation -- two of them with direct exposure on their skin			0
by comparison , a person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year , though @entity60 's health ministry has said that those working directly to avert the nuclear crisis could be exposed to as much as 250 millisieverts before they must leave the site			1
hours before the apology , a @entity22 official told reporters that water samples from the turbine buildings for the no. 1 and 2 reactors had high levels of radiation , though not as high as in the basement of the no. 3 building			1
later saturday , @entity22 amended its assessment of the level of radiation in water in the no. 1 building , saying it was not nearly as dangerous as first reported			1
the water radiation levels were 60 millisieverts per hour -- compared to 200 , as had been stated earlier -- while atmospheric radiation was 25 millisieverts per hour			0
the issue of possible leakage of such material gained urgency saturday after @entity60 's nuclear and industrial safety agency reported the amount of radioactive iodine in seawater recorded 330 meters ( 361 yards ) from the plant was 1,250 times above normal			1
a @entity22 official speculated water runoff or leakage from the turbine buildings may have caused the sudden increase , though he said other factors might have contributed as well			1
friday , @entity139 of @entity60 's @entity140 said the contaminated water suggests " some sort of leakage " from the no. 3 reactor 's core -- signaling a possible breach of the containment vessel that houses the core			1
these developments come despite indications from the @entity151 that the level of airborne radiation around the plant , which is 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0 , " continues to decrease			0
" @entity22 reported on its website that at 7 a.m. saturday , radiation at the plant 's main gate was 0.219 millisieverts per hour -- a fraction of the 400 millisieverts per hour measured between @entity159 and 4 on march 15			2
the measurements are a significant drop from readings taken at the same gate over the past week			0
the presence of highly radioactive water in buildings at reactors nos. 1 , 2 and 3 has halted some efforts to curb the release of further emissions			1
still , others continued and there have been recent signs of progress			0
" we can comfortably say that we are taking measures so that the situation has not deteriorated , " @entity59 said			0
" we 've been able to take some steps forward			0
but still , vigilance is required			0
" fresh water was being pumped saturday at reactors 1 , 2 and 3			1
that replaced the seawater that had previously been used , with the aim of fresh water being simultaneously to cool down nuclear fuel and also flush out accumulating salt that might hinder the reactors ' existing cooling systems			1
the no. 3 reactor has been of particular concern , experts have said , because it is the only one to use a combination of uranium and plutonium fuel , called @entity194 , considered more dangerous than the pure uranium fuel used in other reactors			0
the @entity197 , an industry trade group that is tracking official accounts of the effort at the @entity6 plant , said the pressure of the no. 3 reactor 's containment vessel has been upgraded to " stable			2
" whereas the group had stated friday that damage was suspected in the reactor , on saturday its assessment changed to " unknown " -- a further acknowledgment of uncertainty as to whether the contaminated water was the result of a leak in the nuclear reactor core or had some other cause			0
efforts also continue at the no. 4 , 5 and 6 reactors -- each of which has less pronounced concerns because the units were on scheduled outages when the quake struck			0
none of these three units had nuclear fuel inside their reactors , though efforts are ongoing to control temperatures inside the spent fuel pools			0
@entity1 's @entity230 contributed to this report			0

a @entity60 official says the company must share info to keep public 's trust
fresh water , not seawater , is being pumped into reactors 1 , 2 and 3
