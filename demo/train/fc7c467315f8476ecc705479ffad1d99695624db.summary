-- @entity2 's @entity1 , the gaming and entertainment platform knocked offline for weeks this spring , has been hit again			1
in a message to members , @entity6 , @entity2 's chief information security officer , said the company detected an attempt to try a massive number of user ids and passwords on its network			1
the @entity1 and @entity16 were impacted , @entity6 said			1
but unlike the spring attack , when virtually every one of the @entity1 's 70 million subscribers lost total access , only one - tenth of 1 percent ( about 93,000 people divided between @entity1 and @entity16 ) had their information accessed and were locked down , the company said			1
only a small percentage of those accounts showed suspicious activity after they were accessed , he said			2
" we want to take this opportunity to remind our consumers about the increasingly common threat of fraudulent activity online , as well as the importance of having a strong password and having a username / password combination that is not associated with other online services or sites , " @entity6 wrote			0
" we encourage you to choose unique , hard - to - guess passwords and always look for unusual activity in your account			0
" no credit card information was accessed in the hack , according to the letter			2
network customers who were affected received an e-mail from @entity2 notifying them of the issue			1
everyone who is affected is required by @entity2 to change their passwords on the network			1
the @entity1 went down on april 20 after a web attack on the network , which lets people download games and videos and play them with each other online			1
most players could n't use the network for weeks and it was n't completely restored until the @entity57 went back online in early june			2
a @entity58 19 - year - old allegedly affiliated with the hacker group @entity60 was arrested in late june in connection with the @entity2 attack			1
@entity60 , purportedly a spin - off of the bigger hacker collective @entity65 , posted what they claim is proprietary information from @entity68 and other @entity2 properties ' websites online			2
at june 's @entity74 video - gaming expo , @entity72 president @entity71 apologized to players for the outages			2
he called it the " elephant in the room " and thanked gamers for staying loyal during the down time			0
" you are the lifeblood of this company			0
without you there is no playstation , " @entity71 said			0
" i want to apologize , both personally and on behalf of the company , for any anxiety we caused you			0
many users had responded angrily in the spring , with many of their complaints centering around the week @entity2 took between the hack and making it known to players			1
this time , comments on @entity6 's online post seemed more positive			0
" thanks for letting everyone know so soon , " one user wrote			0
" it 's better to be aware			0
" " this is good that your letting us know this before everyone goes in another rage , " said another .			0

@entity1 hacked -- again
@entity2 : *breach* is smaller than spring attacks that shut down its gaming network
no credit cards were accessed , company says
