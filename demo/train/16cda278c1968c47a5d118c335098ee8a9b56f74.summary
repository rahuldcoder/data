republicans already are steaming about president @entity2 's expected executive action to potentially allow millions of undocumented workers to remain in the country			0
but another debate on immigration will refocus on internal @entity0 splits and raise questions about whether the party is taking any of its own advice about being more open to @entity11			1
pointing to inaction by @entity13 , @entity2 signaled last wednesday that he 's done waiting for @entity0 to negotiate a compromise on any immigration measures			1
" i promise you , the @entity18 people do n't want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for @entity13 to get something done , " he said			0
how far can the president go on executive actions ? house speaker @entity23 warned @entity2 that any move to expand earlier executive action would be " a grievous mistake			0
" in an opinion piece in @entity28 last friday , @entity23 insisted any action to fix immigration " must be done by @entity13 , and it must be done in a common - sense , step - by - step fashion so that the @entity18 people have a say in what we are doing			0
" @entity23 was one of the first top republicans after @entity37 lost the 2012 presidential election to say that the party needed to deal with immigration			0
but a bipartisan @entity42 bill approved last year and backed by some prominent @entity0 hit a wall in the @entity0 - led @entity44			1
because most @entity44 @entity0 districts are solidly red , most of the party 's rank and file feared primary challenges from the right			1
the incentive was to stop immigration reform , not move it forward			0
recent actions contradict efforts to be inclusive with @entity13 divided , @entity2 to go his own way on immigration many @entity0 leaders and possible presidential candidates , however , say the @entity0 needs a more inclusive message to @entity11 if it hopes to win the @entity44 in 2016			1
but the message they 're hearing on immigration from many in the party could make it harder to build relationships with the @entity11 community			1
@entity44 bill right before leaving town for the @entity71 , the @entity44 passed a bill that would prevent the president from renewing deportation deferments â€” or granting new ones -- for the roughly 600,000 young people brought into the country illegally by undocumented immigrant parents			0
if the bill were to become law , it would mean those people could be deported			0
the vote was largely along party lines and republicans pressing for broader reform said that ending the @entity2 administration 's program easing such deportations sent the wrong message			2
" why are @entity84 continuing to shoot themselves in the foot ? " @entity91 , a @entity0 himself and a former commerce secretary for @entity94 , asked in a @entity96 interview			1
a chief proponent of the @entity44 bill , @entity100 rep. @entity99 , was confronted in his home state last week at an event with sen. @entity103 , a likely 2016 presidential candidate			0
with media present covering @entity103 , a woman claiming that she would be deported if the measure became law confronted @entity99 about the legislation			0
@entity103 was seen leaving before the matter turned into a heated debate			0
@entity103 has made broadening the @entity0 's appeal a cornerstone of his message			1
he helped open @entity0 offices in minority neighborhoods in his home state and appeared before numerous @entity117 - @entity18 groups , highlighting his support for reforming criminal sentencing guidelines			1
former 2012 vice presidential candidate @entity120 has also traveled to more than a dozen communities around the country to discuss poverty issues and promote his economic growth policies			0
but @entity125 have pounced on @entity99 's @entity100 dust - up as well as others trying to paint the @entity0 as more extreme on immigration			1
@entity129 says youths crossing the border is a ' side issue ' @entity134 rep. @entity133 said in a recent interview that he believed some were waging a " war on whites			1
" @entity133 was responding to a reporter pointing out the @entity0 's own fears about its dwindling appeal among @entity11			1
but he argued that @entity125 are " claiming that whites hate everybody else , " which he insisted was " not true			0
" republicans nervous rep. @entity145 of @entity146 was one of 11 @entity84 to oppose the @entity44 bill and told @entity96 the decision by @entity0 leaders to allow a vote on it was " disappointing			1
" echoing the same sentiment expressed by @entity2 , @entity145 said the measure was " a messaging bill " and " would never see the light of day " over in the @entity42			0
" we 've got kids who are going to high schools that know of no other country to call home and we 've got to address all aspects of immigration reform , " @entity145 said			0
senate majority leader @entity163 has no plans to take it up in the @entity125 - led @entity42 and @entity2 has said he would veto it anyway			0
@entity23 did n't want to turn the discussion over addressing the crisis of @entity170 migrant youth streaming across the southern border into a broader debate over immigration			1
he agreed that @entity13 needed to work with the @entity44 and @entity125 to pass narrow legislation to deal with the issues that caused the surge of immigrants and provide resources to handle the tens of thousands who already arrived			2
number of unaccompanied minors crossing into @entity18 tops 60,000 a political wedge but @entity183 @entity0 sen. @entity0 , a tea party hero , insisted that halting @entity2 's ability to defer future deportations had to be part of the @entity0 's response to the border situation			1
as part of a deal to pass a $ 694 million border funding bill , @entity23 and his top lieutenants agreed to allow a separate vote on a measure promoted by @entity44 conservatives that went even further than @entity0 's proposal			1
the bill would end all deportation deferments because they worried @entity2 would use his executive authority to expand them			2
@entity203 @entity202 rep. @entity202 also voted against that bill and told @entity96 that the @entity0 proposal helps @entity125 continue to use immigration as a political wedge			1
" it gives them another bullet point in their narrative , " @entity202 said			0
both @entity145 and @entity202 criticized @entity2 's actions on immigration			0
they said it was appropriate for @entity13 to respond to when it believes he is overstepping his legal authority			0
" if the message is perceived as strictly to protect the civil liberties and basic rights of our democracy , that is one thing			2
but if the message is perceived to be anti-immigrant , that is very , very negative , " @entity202 said			2
party not taking its own advice the recent actions show republicans are n't taking their own advice on growing their party			0
last spring , the @entity232 issued a report that examined its 2012 loss and called for the @entity0 to address immigration reform			1
the so - called " autopsy report " warned that " if @entity238 @entity18 perceive that a @entity0 nominee or candidate does not want them in the @entity18 , they will not pay attention to our next sentence			1
" @entity244 , a top party strategist and a report co-author , told @entity96 that " tone is important			0
" he conceded that taking on immigration reform " takes political courage			0
" but he also warned against " talking in a way that 's not too hot and comes across as negative or exclusive			0
" @entity244 added , " we 're a big , broad party -- we 're not all going to agree on immigration -- not going to agree on everything , but we certainly have to have people in @entity254 on the @entity0 and @entity125 side that want to get things done			1
" @entity44 @entity0 also heard about it on the editorial page of the @entity258 , which does n't usually criticize @entity0			1
" a party whose preoccupation is deporting children is going to alienate many conservatives , never mind minority voters			2
the episode is also sure to raise doubts among swing voters about whether @entity0 would be prepared to govern if they do win control of the entire @entity13 , " the @entity258 said			1
advice on what to do even if @entity0 ca n't enact immigration reform in a divided @entity13 , others advise it has to look like it is at least trying to do something			1
" @entity0 support among @entity238 voters does not hinge on immigration reform but inaction			1
our inaction and poor optics can eviscerate any future we have right now , " @entity281 , a @entity0 strategist and author of " @entity283 -- why @entity284 , " said			1
@entity91 said that he saw a scenario for @entity0 to be on the offense if the party is able to retake control of the @entity42 in november			1
he suggested the @entity44 and @entity42 could come together on a proposal that would both secure the border but also provide some path to legal status for the 11 million undocumented workers			2
presenting a bill to @entity2 would put the onus on him to respond and make him the subject of blame if he rejected it			0
" i think this is one of those ' @entity302 goes to @entity304 ' things -- it will be a @entity0 who reforms immigration			1
i do n't believe that @entity125 have the credibility , " @entity91 said			0
expanding the wedge ? many @entity0 interviewed by @entity96 said the challenge next year will be even greater because @entity125 will want to use any divisions on the issue to further expand the wedge between the @entity0 and @entity11 voters going into the 2016 election			1
but they warned that the party ca n't use that as an excuse to not promote a message of positive reform			2
" this is what people are elected to do , " @entity244 said			0
" just do your job -- i 'm talking to @entity0 and @entity125 alike			2
this is a two - way street			0
" campaign officials from both parties say immigration is not a top - tier issue for the midterms			2
there are only a handful of @entity84 in competitive races in districts with significant @entity11 populations			2
the @entity0 is well positioned to win control of the @entity42 in november , and immigration is expected to be a factor in just one key contest in @entity340 , where there is a sizable number of @entity238 voters			2
but the 2016 vote is again expected to come down to a handful of key swing states where both parties will work hard to win over independents			0
and many republicans agree that the party 's record on immigration will be important in states like @entity340 , @entity354 , @entity355 , and @entity203 , which are home to expanding populations of @entity11 voters			2
calling immigration reform the " 800 - pound gorilla in the room , " @entity202 said if @entity362 perceive that @entity0 do n't want to deal with immigration , then " that is a major , major , major stumbling block to get over			2

@entity0 *struggling* internally on message they 're sending to @entity11
some @entity0 are worried about impact of some *anti-immigration* *hardliners*
crisis of thousands of migrant children streaming to the border illuminates the issue
