@entity0 , @entity1 -- one of the biggest - name dance djs in the world , @entity3 is in demand at clubs and festivals from @entity9 to @entity10			1
@entity3 witnessed the birth of electronic music " as a sub-culture " in his hometown of @entity0			1
twice voted the world 's top @entity16 , @entity3 has also earned a reputation as a freethinker and social activist , working for children 's charities and speaking out against drug use in dance culture			1
his years on the road have not dented the 37 - year - old @entity27 's enthusiasm for his hometown			2
he talks to @entity29 , my life about the city where he cut his teeth on the dance scene and where he still lives			2
@entity2 : what is it you like about @entity0 ? @entity3 : it is a very open city ; it 's very open - minded , cosmopolitan			1
there are a lot of people from all over the world coming to this place and bringing something to the place and this is something very special			2
something that i really appreciate , especially since i knew @entity0 from a time when it was n't that way , this is something i like a lot			1
@entity2 : do you think the way the city was divided in the past has made it more united today ? @entity3 : i do n't think it is more united ; there is still a distinctive difference between the west and east , not just in terms of architecture or the structure of the city			1
also the mentality of the people somehow -- i believe a lot of @entity68 still feel like @entity69 , and @entity70 likewise			1
after such a long time , i think it 's still an issue			0
@entity2 : how would you explain these differences ? @entity3 : it 's very difficult because i think if i was trying to describe it , it would be very unfair on a lot of people because not all @entity69 @entity80 are alike , nor are all @entity81 @entity80 the same			1
there are certain issues that seem to group up			0
i 'm an @entity85 in @entity1 , living quite an international life			0
@entity2 : describe the attitude of the typical @entity27 ? @entity3 : @entity0 provides the freedom to live your individual lifestyle and do what you want			1
at the same time there is kind of a unity to it			0
you know , the @entity95 kind of stick together and that 's something very special and something you 'll probably only experience in @entity0			2
there 's a kind of cute toughness to it -- you do n't get angry about it			0
@entity2 : as an artist , what inspires you about the city ? @entity3 : i 'm definitely inspired by the dirty basement , clubbing atmosphere			1
this is where i grew up ; where the clubs were and where the music happened			0
i think @entity0 is a city where electronic music started as a sub-culture , as something against the established culture and there 's still some sort of punk in it			1
that 's still in my music and always will be , no matter what i do			0
@entity2 : what do you think is the predominant culture of @entity0 ? @entity3 : i think @entity0 has a coffee shop / bar culture			1
when i say bar , it 's not necessarily the posh sort of thing , it 's more the place where people meet and hang out after work or before they go clubbing , and that is quite established			0
there are few clubs in the world that became cathedrals of electronic music : @entity149 in @entity149 ; @entity150 in @entity151 ( in northern @entity152 ) ; @entity153 in @entity154			0
@entity155 was the place in @entity0 for electronic music ; this was one of my first residencies in @entity0			2
it was just a big black warehouse with a loud pa and great music and great people			0
@entity2 : what inspired you to become a musician ? @entity3 : the reason i started to @entity16 was because i was so bored with the music in the clubs in @entity0 -- it was really one - dimensional			1
my musical education came from listening to the radio so i knew there was so much more in the whole wide world of electronic music to be discovered			0
so i went to record stores , i bought some records and made some tapes for myself and friends			0
one of my friends passed my tape on to a promoter and that 's how i got my first gig			0
so that 's when i knew , this is what i wanted to do			0
@entity2 : was there a point that you thought , '' now i 've made it ' ? @entity3 : i think your career ends when you start thinking ' i 've made it			2
' i never really felt there was a moment where suddenly i thought , ' wow , this is really happening			2
' my first gig was very special to me because that 's when i realized that this is what i really wanted to do			0
but every single gig is still a challenge ; i still put all my efforts into it			0
@entity2 : is there something different about playing to a home crowd ? @entity3 : it 's always more challenging ( laughs )			2
no , to me it 's always very special because a lot of my friends are here and we always do our own events in @entity0 so there 's always a little more involvement than just going there and playing			2
@entity2 : what makes @entity0 home to you ? @entity3 : i love @entity0 because i know my way around , which is something that 's important to me			1
the other thing is that it 's a city that provides a lot of chill - out space in a way ; you know , places where you can just go and relax , especially when you have a hectic schedule like mine			1
@entity2 : where do you like to go to relax ? @entity3 : well , @entity0 has a lot of parks ; i think it is one of the greenest cities in the world			1
personally for me , the stables , the horse riding thing where i can relax a little and chill out			0
where i live i can run with my dogs from one park to the next park to the next			0
@entity2 : if the city was a person what would they be like ? @entity3 : miserable but happy , poor but rich in thought -- and very twisted ( laughs ) .			1

@entity3 says his hometown of @entity0 is open - minded and cosmopolitan
a division still exists between @entity81 and @entity69 despite the @entity251 coming down , he says
the @entity16 says the city has a lot of " chill - out space " *helped* by its many parks
if it was a person @entity0 would be " poor but rich in thought " , he says
