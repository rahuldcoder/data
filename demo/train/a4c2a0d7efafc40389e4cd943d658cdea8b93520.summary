@entity0 , @entity1 -- people on death row have a lot of time to think			1
since his conviction for the 1993 murders of three 8 - year - old boys , @entity8 has been fighting to keep his thoughts moving forward : to study , to grow intellectually and to distance himself from the bitterness that threatens to consume him			1
@entity8 was one of three teenagers convicted for that crime			1
they became known as the " @entity7 , " probably the most feared and hated kids to ever walk into an @entity1 courtroom			1
the crime they were accused of was particularly heinous : the boys ' bruised and mutilated bodies were found in may 1993 in @entity24 , @entity1 , their arms and legs bound with their own shoelaces			1
@entity8 was the only one sentenced to die , believed to be the ring leader in murders driven by a worship of @entity31			1
that was almost 18 years ago			1
today @entity8 spends 23 hours a day alone in a cell with nothing to do but ponder all he 's lost and wonder if the @entity36 will be the key that finally sets him free			1
later this year , an @entity36 judge will determine if @entity8 and the rest of the @entity7 should have their convictions thrown out			1
prosecutors would then have the chance to retry them all and since they were sent to prison , the cases against them seem to have fallen apart			1
@entity8 ' attorneys plan to present dna evidence not available at the time of the trial , as well as testimony that they say supports arguments that @entity8 and the two others are innocent			1
' @entity7 ' cases receive new hearing on a dreary , overcast day in late november , i was allowed to talk to @entity8 for two hours about his conviction , his hopes and his most hated question -- the one he fears will follow him for the rest of his life , whether he is freed or not			1
i was n't sure what to expect			1
an advocate who arranged my interview with @entity8 cautioned that " @entity64 does not suffer fools gladly			1
" i remember thinking how pale and gaunt @entity8 , now 36 years old , appeared as he was escorted down a hallway to a seat behind a thick glass wall			1
the handcuffs left bright red marks on his pale skin after they were removed			1
" that looks like it hurt , " i said			1
looking down and rubbing his wrist , @entity8 replied softly , " it does			2
" he seemed a little surprised i would notice something like that			2
@entity8 says he has given hundreds of interviews , so many that there seems to be no question he would not be prepared to answer			2
the one question that has always bothered him the most also is the most obvious : did you kill those children ? @entity8 believes the answer should be equally obvious			2
@entity8 : after all the new evidence that we have that 's come up now , it feels to me like i should n't have to answer that anymore , that people should be able to look at the evidence now and know that i did n't do it , without having to ask me that			2
@entity94 : people are going to be watching you right now			2
they 're going to be asking that question in their minds			2
they 're going to be judging you			2
@entity94 : i 'll just ask you the question			2
did you kill those boys ? @entity8 : no , i did n't			1
no , i did n't			2
@entity94 : when you answer that , what 's different now , compared to when you were on trial ? do you think people are listening now , who might not have been listening before ? @entity8 : i think so			1
i think you have some people now who are looking at the evidence , who do			2
it 's been long enough for people to get past their emotions			2
the evidence @entity8 talks about is dna and the fact that not a single tiny cell was recovered from the crime scene that belonged to the three convicted teens			1
police did find a hair on one of the bodies that was a possible match to the stepfather of one of the victims			2
the emotion @entity8 refers to is the fear and raw anger of a public that he believes was out for his blood			2
the investigation , arrests and trials fueled the outrage , producing nightly reports of grisly details and shocking headlines			0
@entity8 seemed immune to it during his trial , appearing only to be what he describes as a " smart - ass " and " white trash " 18 - year - old			1
but some wounds cut to the bone and today his scars seem just as deep			0
@entity8 was so interview - savvy that i was surprised when he suddenly got emotional			0
@entity94 : are my questions upsetting you right now ? @entity8 : it 's hard			0
( pause ) and i do n't know why			0
because you would think i 'd be used to this by now			0
( long pause ) i do n't know			0
it -- it 's hard			0
it -- it -- it -- like i said , it does n't get any easier			0
and you would think i would be used to this by now			0
but -- you do n't get used to this			0
( sighs ) and it does continue to get worse as time goes by			1
knowing that -- you know , even if i were to go to trial today , and we were to present all this new evidence , and they were to find us not guilty , i would still , for the rest of my life , have people looking at me and asking me these questions about me , thinking these things about me			1
there 's no way to -- for them to undo what 's been done			0
if the @entity36 dismisses his conviction and orders a new trial for the three men , it would be extremely rare			1
but so far , @entity8 has beaten the odds			0
consider that under normal circumstances , my interview would have never taken place			0
@entity8 was originally scheduled to be executed in 1994			0
instead he sits alone in his cell while possibly thousands follow his case			1
he has won the support of celebrities like @entity194 and @entity195			0
@entity8 is also married to a woman who left her job and life behind to fight for him in @entity1			1
not bad for a " smart - ass " " white trash " convicted killer			1
@entity94 : if the court does eventually decide that you are innocent , you know what that means ? @entity8 : what ? @entity94 : that the killer is still out there			0
@entity94 : what would you want for that killer ? @entity8 : that 's a hard question			0
because my first instinct would be that he have to suffer everything that i 've had to suffer for the past almost 18 years now			0
but i do n't want to be that person			0
i do n't want to be that angry			0
i do n't want to be that bitter			0
there are people who remain convinced of his guilt and want him to die			0
after our interview , there was one comment from @entity8 i could n't forget			0
" i miss the stars , " he said			0
" you know , i have n't seen the stars in years and years and years			0
i miss all these things			0
but what it comes down to the most -- and this is the thing that will scar me the most and that i 'll carry with me as a scar the longest -- the thing i miss the most is being treated like a human being			0
