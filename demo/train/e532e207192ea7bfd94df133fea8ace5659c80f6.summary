@entity0 on tuesday stepped before an emperor and into a new global limelight , along a path paved by her father			1
arriving at @entity7 's @entity6 in a maroon horse - drawn carriage , the 55 - year - old presented @entity9 with her credentials to serve as the @entity12 ambassador to @entity13			1
along the route into the palace 's leafy grounds , onlookers waited to catch a glimpse of her in the late autumn sunshine			0
some waved small @entity13 and @entity12 flags			1
" this appointment has a special significance as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of my father 's presidency , " she told a @entity24 committee in september before being confirmed for the post			1
her father , president @entity33 , was assassinated november 22 , 1963 -- 50 years ago this week			1
" i am conscious of my responsibility to uphold the ideals he represented -- a deep commitment to public service , a more just @entity12 and a more peaceful world , " @entity0 said			2
for all the pomp of tuesday 's event , the significance of @entity0 's arrival as a historic marker runs deep			1
@entity33 battled against @entity13 in @entity45 in fact , he said @entity13 's success against him was what made him a hero			1
" it was involuntary , " he once said			0
" they sank my boat			0
" his encounter with a @entity13 destroyer on the night of august 1 , 1943 , " may be the most famous small - craft engagement in naval history , " the @entity53 says			1
continuing the legacy later , he " hoped to be the first sitting president to make a state visit to @entity13 , " @entity0 told the @entity59			1
@entity33 planned to reunite the crew of his boat , the @entity65 , with the crew of the @entity67 that sank it , says @entity69 , government professor at @entity70			2
it was an effort to calm protests in @entity13 against renewal of the @entity12 - @entity13 alliance , @entity69 wrote in a column for @entity76			2
" if confirmed as ambassador , i would be humbled to carry forward his legacy in a small way and represent the powerful bonds that unite our two democratic societies , " @entity0 told the @entity24 committee			1
at a state dinner in the new ambassador 's honor last week , @entity12 secretary of state @entity84 said , " the daughter of a heroic lieutenant in @entity45 will be the first woman in the next generation after the war to represent our country in a relationship that symbolizes so much more than just a normal diplomatic relationship			1
this is a symbol of reconciliation , a symbol of possibilities , a symbol of people who know how to put the past behind them and look to the future and build a future together			0
" that is , in today 's world , both remarkable and beautiful			0
" debate over credentials just how well she 'll serve as ambassador , however , is under debate in @entity112 , in diplomatic circles , and in the media			2
a lawyer and philanthropist with degrees from @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity0 has worked to advance @entity121 schools			2
a stalwart supporter of president @entity123 , she launched a failed effort to replace @entity125 in the @entity24 after @entity126 became @entity123 's secretary of state			2
fast facts : @entity0 " a strong , politically savvy woman is just what @entity13 and the @entity12 need to strengthen relations on both sides of the @entity136 , " @entity129 of the @entity130 wrote in a column for @entity76			1
@entity0 " may or may not exactly fit that bill , " @entity129 wrote			2
" with any luck , though , she could leverage her appointment as @entity112 's top envoy to @entity7 to heighten awareness of just how seriously both sides need to take the issue of female leadership			0
" " @entity0 's biggest personal challenge would be to come out of her father 's shadow and establish herself as a top diplomat in her own right , " @entity129 added			1
opinion : how @entity0 could make a difference in @entity13 ' a political neophyte ' some other analysts are far less charitable			1
in two separate posts both titled " amateur hour " -- one from april , the other september -- writers at @entity157 took aim at her credentials or lack thereof			0
" she does n't speak @entity13 and has no academic or professional background in foreign affairs , " @entity161 wrote			2
" compared with some other former @entity12 ambassadors to @entity13 ( e.g. , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , or @entity168 ) , she 's a political neophyte			1
" " she will do fine until her first misstep on policy , " @entity171 and @entity172 wrote			0
" then , if history is any guide , the @entity13 public will turn on her ( and by proxy , the @entity12 government )			0
they will wonder -- publicly and loudly -- why @entity12 take @entity13 for granted and how @entity112 could dispatch such a neophyte to such a sensitive post			0
" @entity184 comes to terms with what happened to @entity33 personal fortune @entity0 has acknowledged that her personal wealth puts her at risk for potential conflicts , @entity188 has reported			1
" i understand that a heightened prospect of a conflict of interest could exist as to the companies that maintain a presence in @entity13 , because they may be more likely than other companies to seek official assistance from or make other contact with the embassy , " she wrote in a letter to the @entity193			0
her net worth is as high as $ 280 million , according to @entity188 's analysis			0
in speaking before the @entity24 committee , however , @entity0 sought to dispel any suggestions that she 'd be unprepared to handle the assignment			0
she fielded questions about the @entity209 , @entity7 's territorial dispute with @entity211 in the @entity212 and military cooperation			0
she vowed to work with @entity214 " to advance the interests of the @entity12 , protect the safety of our citizens , and strengthen the bilateral relationship for the benefit of both our countries			0
" one @entity33 conspiracy theory that could be true			0

@entity0 presents her credentials as ambassador to @entity13 's @entity9
she has described herself as " humbled " to carry forward her father 's legacy " in a small way "
