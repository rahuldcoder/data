editor 's note : @entity3 's @entity2 traveled with @entity4 to @entity5 on the his first overseas trip as president			1
president @entity4 speaks during a news conference after the @entity10 summit in @entity11 , @entity12 , on april 2			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity3 ) -- one of the most revealing moments of president @entity4 's @entity5 tour came early in the trip at the close of the @entity10 summit in @entity11 , @entity12 , where expectations were sky high for the new guy			1
he had just scored some victories on the financial crisis , while also taking some lumps			0
and now he had to face the media			0
pushed by a reporter on why he could n't get more done , the president was ready with a comeback about how it was far easier for @entity32 and @entity33 leaders to get their way at summits in years gone by			2
" well , if there 's just @entity41 and @entity42 sitting in a room with a brandy , that 's a -- that 's an easier negotiation , " the president said to laughter from reporters			1
" but that 's not the world we live in , and it should n't be the world that we live in			2
" in two simple sentences , the president accomplished a lot			2
in the first sentence , he made a fair point about how no @entity32 president -- @entity4 or @entity57 -- can simply wave a magic wand and get the world to follow his lead			1
and in the second , with the line about how " it should n't be the world that we live in , " he was trying to send a signal to @entity5 that he 's not planning to bully them			1
again and again , @entity4 said he was here to listen and learn -- not to lecture colleagues such as @entity70 president @entity69 and @entity72 chancellor @entity71			1
left unsaid , since it was plain enough to see , was what @entity4 was really saying : i 'm not president @entity57			1
that was clearly @entity4 's biggest accomplishment on this trip			1
he was able to effectively press that reset button administration officials have been talking about in order to make the case that traditional @entity32 allies should come back into the fold , and it seemed to work			2
i remember sitting in the front row during a news conference at a palace in @entity70 to hear @entity69 positively gush , " and it feels really good to be able to work with a @entity32 president who wants to change the world and who understands that the world does not boil down to simply @entity32 frontiers and borders			1
and that is a hell of a good piece of news for 2009			0
" those are the style points where @entity4 clearly scored , and not just with @entity5 leaders			1
a new @entity103 poll found that 79 percent of @entity104 surveyed feel that @entity4 has had a " more positive " effect on how people in other countries view the @entity32 only 19 percent of those surveyed thought he 's had a " more negative " effect			1
the much tougher question is on substance , and whether @entity4 was able to capitalize on those warm feelings to accomplish what he set out to do before this trip			1
on that he basically has an incomplete because the early record here in @entity5 has been mixed			1
at the @entity11 summit , the president pushed for big money to be pumped into the world economy , and the leaders responded with $ 1.1 trillion			2
but that money is being directed to the @entity120 to help developing countries , not pumped into the large economies to stimulate growth as @entity32 officials had hoped			0
and @entity4 was also able to help prevent @entity69 and others from getting a global supercop to oversee markets across all borders , a bit of a victory in his effort to make sure new regulations do not go too far			1
perhaps the biggest victory came on the sidelines of the @entity10 and had nothing to do with the financial crisis			0
@entity4 had his first face - to - face with @entity140 president @entity139 , and they seemed to thaw those recently icy relations			1
most important , is the two men agreed to begin intense negotiations to drastically reduce each side 's nuclear stockpiles			2
this could be a dramatic step forward for world peace , so pay close attention to this development			0
but a cautionary note : there 's a lot of heavy lifting left before this becomes a reality , and we may not know until @entity4 's visit to @entity159 in july whether or not this deal has legs			1
at the @entity164 summit in @entity70 and @entity72 , the president was hoping to get a boost in resources for the war in @entity168			2
he did get allies to cough up about 5,000 troops , but in the form of police and security trainers -- not combat troops			0
so with @entity4 already committing 21,000 more @entity32 troops to the mission , this is a very @entity32 - heavy effort , something to keep a close eye on in the days ahead			1
in @entity183 , @entity182 , at the @entity181 summit , @entity4 delivered a speech about nuclear nonproliferation to more than 20,000 people -- a boisterous crowd reminiscent of the campaign			1
he even used the old line " yes we can " to answer critics who think he ca n't follow through on ridding the world of nuclear weapons			0
but the most important moment of that stop in the tour came a few hours before the speech			0
it was when the infamous 3 a.m. phone call that @entity200 talked about in the campaign finally arrived			0
except it came at 4:30 a.m. , when spokesman @entity203 woke the president with the news that @entity206 had tested a missile			0
he basically passed the test of his first international crisis ( with -- ahem -- secretary of state @entity210 at his side , no less ) , although so far the administration has gotten nowhere at the @entity213 despite a clear case against @entity206			0
welcome to the @entity213 , sir			0
and finally , in @entity14 the president officially began his outreach to try and repair the @entity32 image in the @entity219 world			0
most interesting is that he got personal , alluding to the fact that he grew up in @entity222 and his father was @entity219 -- politically risky given that last year he spent so much time having to deny false rumors that he 's @entity219			0
" the @entity32 has been enriched by @entity104 , " @entity4 said			2
" many other @entity104 have @entity219 in their family , or have lived in a @entity219 - majority country -- i know , because i am one of them			0
" the speech was very well - received in this @entity219 - majority nation			0
but it will take far more than one speech to fix tensions flared by everything from the war to @entity237 to the @entity32 military prison at @entity239			0
in all , that 's a hefty agenda to confront in just eight days abroad			0
it 's no surprise then that i 've noticed the president has been looking very tired on this trip			2
one aide told me that @entity4 was planning to go out for a nice unofficial dinner with first lady @entity247 in @entity183 on saturday night but it was canceled because they simply needed some sleep			2
the fatigue has been complicated by the fact that @entity4 has been battling a nasty cold , telling aides he feels like he 's got an " acorn up my nose " -- an interesting turn of phrase i had never heard before but seems to mean the president is stuffed up			1
and that brings me back to that brandy @entity41 and @entity42 shared decades ago			1
@entity4 made a legitimate claim about the difficulty of calling the shots in the current global environment , where small and mid-sized countries hold more sway than before			2
but right now all i can focus on is the brandy itself			0
after eight long days on the road , and very little sleep , i 'm pretty ragged , too			0
that sounds like a pretty good way to cap things off .			0

@entity4 : @entity276 's fate no longer *decided* by @entity41 and @entity42 sitting over brandy
@entity5 respond *favorably* to president 's message that it 's a new era
@entity4 meets @entity140 president @entity139 ; relations start to thaw
lots of heavy lifting to be done to make lofty goals reality , @entity3 's @entity2 cautions
