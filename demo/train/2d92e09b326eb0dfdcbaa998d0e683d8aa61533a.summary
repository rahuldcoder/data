now in its third season , " @entity8 " has one of those problems that soap operas bump up against all the time : story fatigue			1
you can only ask your audience to buy into the political shenanigans of @entity13 ( @entity14 ) and wife @entity15 ( @entity16 ) for so long , given the @entity18 contortions that the series uses to entertain			1
that manipulation often comes at the expense of believability — because " @entity8 " refuses to restrain itself and often goes , in a parlance that @entity13 would approve of , balls out in an effort to make the @entity27 ridiculously ruthless and the series ridiculously entertaining			0
unfortunately , after holding out against the cruel intrusion of reality , at some point in season two of " @entity8 , " ridiculous was the key word for pretty much everything in it			1
" @entity35 : " 10 ruthless quotes from ' @entity37 that would n't be much of a problem if " @entity8 " was , like a true soap opera , keenly aware of its reputation ( like , say , " scandal " )			1
meaning , if " @entity8 " really believed that its ridiculousness was a wink - wink at the audience , its diversions from believability would n't be so troubling			2
instead , " @entity8 " has been the poster series for both the popularity of @entity50 as a streaming service with strong original content and as a big player for the service at awards shows			0
it takes itself very seriously			0
in that role , " @entity8 " is often touted as a prestige drama a la " @entity60 , " " @entity61 " and " the @entity62 , " among others			0
but if season two proved anything , with its collapsing parade of paper tigers standing up to @entity69 's quest for ultimate power , it 's that the series is far more entertaining than it is great			1
power wielded by a ruthless married couple as they sack @entity74 is a pretty fun thing to behold , soapy as it is racing toward the assured victory , the stakes - free gamble			2
there just was n't much gravitas in the midst of it as the bubbles got in your eyes			2
i 'm certainly fine with " @entity8 " being that show			0
if you buy into it as a sweet , sparkling wine to be guzzled without care as you binge your way through it , that seems very apropos of what you 're getting			0
the danger is confusing it with actual @entity100			0
awards shows are still making this qualitatively dubious connection ( as they 've done to an even worse degree with another soap opera , " @entity106 " )			0
i worry that the creative forces behind " @entity8 " will blindly accept the accolades and not address the more glaring issues critics ( and fans ) began harping on in season two			2
early episodes of the third season of " @entity8 " indicate a change of direction might be afoot , though plenty of worry remains that this will be only temporary and the @entity118 will continue to fool and rule the world with the ease of master puppeteers as the season goes forward			1
but at least in the early going , creator @entity123 and the many executive producers with a hand in this series seem to agree that maybe the @entity118 , now known as the president and first lady of the @entity62 , need to hit some road blocks that they ca n't immediately get around			1
' @entity130 on @entity131 : fans have n't " @entity132 " a series like " @entity8 " has a lot of twists to be spoiled , but there 's no point in doing that here — a good soap keeps the twists coming and that 's what the audience wants			2
but at least in dealing with the basic moving parts of the series , it 's safe to say being president and @entity128 is n't as easy or as satisfying as @entity69 and @entity15 expected			1
@entity69 wants , naturally , to avoid being a placeholder president and focus on getting reelected			1
but everything he 's tried in office — and most of it has been ambitious — has eroded his approval ratings			0
he 's not being very effective and democrats are dubious as to whether he 's the face of the future , especially as the @entity159 are lining up in solidarity behind @entity161 ( @entity162 )			0
for her part , @entity15 — in a storyline that harkens back to the @entity164 years — is n't satisfied just being first lady			1
she wants to lead and do something			0
she wants to be political because that 's what 's in her blood			0
and in a lovely reflection of their odd relationship , @entity15 has no qualms in telling @entity69 that if he 's going down in the next election , she plans to ascend at the same time			1
power and politics — these two understand it , even if it means telling the other that you 'll carry on if they fall			2
after all the cream - puff politicians and supposedly brilliant strategists that the @entity118 have fooled all too easily in the first two seasons , a little payback and a little failure plays well for " @entity8			1
" however , the worry remains that now that they have the ultimate seats in politics , @entity69 and @entity15 wo n't go down without swinging and , in true " @entity8 " fashion , will hit and destroy everything they swing at			1
if that unbelievable sense of dramatic stakes returns , " @entity8 " will find itself in a scandal about how good it really is			0
