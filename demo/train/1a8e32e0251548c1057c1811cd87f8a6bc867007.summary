-- in 2006 i spoke at @entity2 about developing children 's natural powers of creativity and imagination			1
returning to @entity2 in 2010 i wanted to focus on the need for a radical shift in education more generally			1
reforming education is rightly seen as one of the biggest challenges of our times			2
in my view , reform is not enough : the real challenge is to transform education from a 19th century industrial model into a 21st century process based on different principles			1
current systems of education are based on the manufacturing principles of linearity , conformity and standardization			2
the evidence is everywhere that they are failing too many students and teachers			2
a primary reason is that human development is not linear and standardized , it is organic and diverse			2
people , as opposed to products , have hopes and aspirations , feelings and purposes			2
education is a personal process			1
what and how young people are taught has to engage their energies , imaginations and their different ways of learning			2
learn more about @entity47 at @entity2 in the talk i gave at this year 's @entity2 , i made a passing reference to fast food			1
in the catering business , there are two main methods of quality assurance			2
if you have a favorite fast food brand , you can go to any outlet anywhere and know exactly what you will find : same burger , fries , cola , d√©cor , and attitudes			0
everything is standardized and guaranteed			0
by the way , this " cheap " food is also contributing to the most costly epidemic of diabetes and obesity in human history			0
but at least the standards are guaranteed			1
the other method of quality assurance are the star ratings guides , like @entity77			0
these methods do not prescribe what 's on the menu , when restaurants should open , or how they should be decorated			0
they set out criteria of excellence and it 's up to each restaurant to meet them in their own way			1
they can be @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 or anything else			0
they can open when they choose , serve what they like and hire whom they want			0
in general they are much better than fast food and offer a higher standard of service			0
the reason is that they are customized to local markets and personalized to the people they serve			0
education reform movements are often based on the fast - food model of quality assurance : on standardization and conformity			1
what 's needed is a much higher standard of provision based on the principles of personalized learning for every child and of schools customizing their cultures to meet local circumstances			1
this is not a theory			0
there are schools everywhere that demonstrate the practical power of these principles to transform education			1
the challenge is not to take a single model to scale but to propagate these principles throughout education so that teachers , parents , students and principals develop their own approaches to the unique challenges they face in their own communities			1
standardization tends to emphasize the lowest common denominator			0
human aspirations reach much higher and if the conditions are right they succeed			0
understanding those conditions is the real key to transforming education for all our children			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity47 .			1

*sir* @entity47 : school reform is often a process of *mandating* standards and *uniformity*
industrial model for schools provides standards but no room for creativity
he says for creativity to thrive , schools must meet individual and community needs
