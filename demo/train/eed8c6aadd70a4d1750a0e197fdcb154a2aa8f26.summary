-- after officially hosting a single guest -- @entity2 , which its national team ungraciously greeted with a 3 - 1 drubbing -- @entity5 opened its doors wide on friday , the @entity7 's first full day of competition			1
that meant welcoming the last @entity7 's finalists , not to mention tens of thousands of fans in the stands and millions more tuning in on tv			2
here are a few big developments -- from both on and off the pitch -- from friday in @entity5 : reigning champ goes down , hard the last time @entity18 and the @entity19 dueled on soccer 's biggest stage , in 2010 in @entity22 , they went scoreless for 90 minutes of regulation , then 25 more minutes of extra time			1
@entity25 broke the deadlock , giving @entity18 its first ever @entity7 title			1
but friday 's rematch was an oh - so different ballgame			1
things started off well for @entity18 in the @entity32 showdown in @entity33 , as it jumped ahead midway through the first half on a penalty call in the box			1
the @entity19 notched up the score just before the break on a pretty diving header by @entity42 striker @entity41			1
@entity19 pumped in four goals within 30 minutes in the second half , crushing the reigning @entity7 champs en route to a convincing 5 - 1 decision			1
@entity49 thump @entity18 @entity51 eyes alleged match - fixing considering @entity18 's success in recent world tournaments , one might think that friday 's rout is impossible to believe			1
while there 's no indication of any fix in the @entity18 - @entity49 ' matchup specifically , @entity51 secretary general @entity56 did tell @entity0 's @entity61 on friday that members of his international investigative agency are in @entity5 and other places due to serious concerns about match - fixing and illegal betting during this year 's tournament			1
during the interview in @entity69 , @entity56 said that whenever " there are organized groups engaged in illegal betting " -- as is happening in connection with the @entity7 -- there are worries they might try to impact results			1
" with illegal betting , there 's a greater likelihood that there could be an influence on the outcome of the match or an influence on what happens on the pitch , based on a bribe or some kind of corrupt act , " @entity56 said			1
@entity89 slaps @entity90 over corruption probe the idea of corruption in international soccer is unfathomable , you think ? well , you might want to think again			0
the latest scandal that has embarrassed the sport has to do with the awarding of the @entity99 to @entity99 , setting the stage for a tournament in that small , dry and scorching ( if the event is in summer , as it usually is ) @entity103 nation			0
so far , there 's been no official finding this decision was n't aboveboard -- though the whole process has already claimed a few high - ranking officials in @entity111 's @entity110 and @entity113 representative @entity112			1
in addition , @entity114 has been banned for life in connection with another bribery scandal , while @entity89 vice president @entity119 quit after being implicated in the same case			0
the latest official in the sport to be ensnared in all this is also one of its biggest names : @entity90			2
@entity90 banned by @entity89 the only man to win the @entity7 as a team captain and coach has been provisionally suspended from all soccer - related activity for 90 days , @entity89 announced friday			1
he was one of the 22 @entity89 executive committee members who voted on the 2022 site			0
the sport 's world governing body claimed that the 68 - year - old @entity90 failed " to cooperate " with a probe of @entity99 and its bidding process " despite repeated requests for assistance " in answering questions either in person or in writing			2
last week , @entity90 told @entity142 media that he did not respond to the questions because they were in @entity143 and he did not understand them			0
@entity89 said in its statement that the questions were presented in @entity142 as well as @entity143			0
@entity147 teams win again but enough of these downers			0
let 's get back to @entity147 , where the fun has begun -- especially for teams from there			0
@entity5 , by virtue of its tournament - opening win , was the first to join the party			1
then @entity157 , out of @entity158 , took center stage in the next contest in @entity161			0
the game was n't always pretty or clean , with three controversially disallowed goals ( two by @entity157 , one by @entity164 )			0
it certainly was n't dry , with a persistent , pelting rain drenching everything in sight			0
but friday 's matchup was successful for @entity157 , which earned a 1 - 0 victory to even @entity157 up points-wise with @entity5 in @entity171 the final contest friday pitted @entity173 against @entity174 in the inland city of @entity176 , which is closer to the @entity178 capital of @entity179 than @entity180 , @entity5			1
the @entity173 pounced on the @entity181 from the get - go , notching two goals within the first 14 minutes			2
@entity174 got within a goal and narrowly missed several chances to tie it up , only to give up another score late to fall by a 3 - 1 margin			2
tuning in , from @entity188 to the @entity189 while only eight countries have taken the stage so far , that does n't mean the rest of the world has n't been watching			0
some 3.2 billion people watched the @entity196 , according to @entity89			0
and while ratings are n't in yet about the current edition , the expectation is that these numbers will grow			0
@entity5 2014 set to smash tv records this despite the fact that there 's a lot of other stuff going on			1
not just things like work , chasing after kids or making a sandwich , but dealing with war , famine and other harsh realities that plague our world			0
the people of @entity188 have been dealing with the aftermath of a military coup , which followed months of unrest that destabilized the elected government and spawned outbursts of violence			0
the @entity224 nation 's leaders subsequently instituted a nighttime curfew to keep things in check			0
but on friday , they lifted that curfew in more than 30 provinces and districts , including tourist havens @entity229 , @entity231 and @entity232			2
that 's a good thing for soccer fans , given that -- due to the time difference with @entity5 -- games run from 11 p.m. and into the early morning , local time			1
those in @entity239 , though , still ca n't go out to watch games with friends and family , because the curfew there is still on			2
soccer - mad @entity239 still under curfew one man who seems likely to catch a game or 10 lives half a world away in the @entity189			2
an @entity249 with @entity251 roots born as @entity252 , he 's today better known as @entity252			2
the erstwhile supporter of the @entity255 club @entity254 declined , in an interview with the @entity258 newspaper @entity257 , to say which team he 'll be rooting for this @entity7			0
the pontiff -- who , per the @entity262 faith , has big - time connections in the highest of places -- said he 's promised @entity5 that he will remain neutral .			1

after the opener *thursday* , three games are played in @entity5 on friday
@entity19 routs @entity18 in a rematch of the 2010 final
@entity51 official notes worries about match - fixing , illegal betting
