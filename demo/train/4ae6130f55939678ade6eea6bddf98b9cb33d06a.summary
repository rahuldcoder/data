-- no one imagined a thin sheet of ice could wreak this much havoc			2
paralyzed by the glaze and gridlock , countless drivers in the @entity6 spent the night shivering in their cars , unable to get home after more than half a day ... and counting			1
here are some of their stories : stuck en route to a funeral @entity15 was on a journey she did n't want to have to make -- she was en route to a funeral when her @entity19 bus stopped cold on an @entity20 interstate tuesday night			1

" i really hope i make it up there in time , " the @entity24 , @entity25 , woman told @entity0 wednesday morning			2
" this is n't something i 've ever experienced			2
" she 's not sure where she is , just that she was on @entity32 heading north when traffic stopped moving at 10 p.m. " there are hundreds , maybe thousands of motorists with me , " @entity15 said			2
" you look out the window and see people in the middle of the interstate sleeping in their cars			1
" the mood on the bus is calm , despite there being no food or water on board , she said			2
@entity15 still has a long way to go ; her final destination is @entity51			2
" the weather is clear			2
that 's the worst part about it			2
the sun will melt the snow before anyone comes to save us			2
" children stuck in schools , on buses desperation and kindness in the 12 hours that @entity65 contended with the ice and traffic , her suv careened into a ditch twice			1
it took her five hours to pick up her son from school			1
they spent another seven hours in the car , trying to get to their @entity20 home several miles away			1
the day dragged into night			1
finally , the sight of a nine - car wreck sent her over the edge			2
" at that very moment , i thought , you know what , i need help -- i ca n't do this anymore			2
i need to get home			2
" so she vented her frustration on @entity87 , and friends directed her to the page @entity90			1

i sat in this traffic for 12 hours			1
it was all about faith and believing , " @entity98 said			2
