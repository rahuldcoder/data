@entity0 , @entity1 -- when an earthquake - triggered tsunami cascaded into this tiny island in late september , the result was 34 lives lost and untold millions in property damage			1
but a @entity2 investigation to air on tonight 's " @entity10 " has uncovered an array of unsettling facts that point to a single conclusion : this natural disaster was in many ways a man - made tragedy			1
public records show that the @entity19 had awarded millions of federal dollars in grants for disaster preparedness here , including the construction of an island - wide siren warning system			1
but all the federal funding was frozen in early 2007 after @entity19 inspectors found that the local @entity1 @entity1 government had been diverting millions of those dollars for its own uses			1
@entity32 , director of @entity1 's territorial office of @entity19 from 2003 through 2007 , now lives in southern @entity34 , not far from @entity35 , @entity36			1
he showed @entity2 on a map exactly where on the island the sirens were to have been placed			0
thirty towers in all , he said , with 30 sirens that could have been activated by the push of a single button			0
" you 're saying that the systems should have been in place ? " @entity2 correspondent @entity47 asked him			0
" absolutely , " @entity32 said			0
" and people died as a result ? " " yes			1
" he 's not the only one who thinks so			2
federal sources told @entity2 they believe that had the warning system been built , the death toll would likely have been lower			1
in @entity1 , however , territorial gov. @entity56 , told @entity2 that he knew of no viable plan for the siren system			1
" there was a study , i believe , but never a plan for a system , " the governor said			2
" i was trying to get verification of what happened to that system , but i could not get the definite information			2
" @entity32 said he was fired by the governor when the federal funding was frozen , and that the governor was aware of the preparations			0
" i 'm not going to fault them for freezing the funds , " @entity56 said			2
" these are federal funds that they have oversight responsibility for and they saw fit to freeze the funds			2
" the governor told @entity2 he had tried to correct the problem by firing his entire homeland security staff			0
but , he said , that failed to solve the problem			0
" all i 'm saying is we have tried to work with them and have tried to get partial releases ( of the money ) , and so far that has n't happened			0
" a federal official calls the governor 's statement " nonsense			2
" @entity1 would have access to the frozen funds if it had agreed to pay back even some of the money it misused , said the official			1
the government and the governor refused , and the tsunami siren system was stopped , according to the official			1
a spokesman for the governor 's office later declined comment on the nature of the negotiations			2
@entity1 @entity1 government officials said they purchased another warning system -- radios that would have triggered alarms across the island			1
but during the @entity2 interview , @entity56 conceded that the system " was not in place " when the tsunami struck			1
@entity2 has learned that the @entity116 is now conducting an investigation into exactly what did happen to the federal preparedness dollars sent to @entity1			1
it was launched , sources tell @entity2 , by the @entity121 as its @entity123 office has federal administrative responsibility for the island			0
the @entity116 investigation is only the latest and most recent attempt by the federal government to try to track what one federal official told @entity2 was " endemic " corruption on the island			2
here are only a few instances of the alleged corruption : both the current @entity1 lieutenant governor and a former state senator are under federal indictment on allegations of fraud , bribery and conspiracy			1
a trial is pending in @entity142 because there are no federal courts on the island			0
attorneys for both men have refuted the indictment in court filings and say their clients are innocent of all the charges			0
an inspector general 's report by the @entity19 issued in may 2007 cites numerous examples of @entity1 officials misusing federal grant money			1
the report 's findings include the purchase of six flat - screen televisions for more than $ 25,000 ; purchase of executive leather chairs for $ 4,000 ; spending $ 77,000 on equipment no auditor could find ; and extensive travel and entertainment charges , including money spent in @entity168 , @entity169 , by a @entity1 official for a conference he was scheduled to have attended in @entity172			1
the @entity19 letter freezing its funding was sent on january 12 , 2007			1
the action was taken because " we have found that @entity178 funds have been diverted to uses by state government offices for other than the intended use of @entity19 funds			1
this is not only in violation of public trust but in @entity186 of agreement as well			0
" in the @entity1 villages destroyed by the tsunami , stories of corruption are not new			1
" the government here gets a lot of money from the @entity202 federal government , " @entity192 told @entity2 as he watched members of his @entity195 help in the clean up			0
" every year , they get millions and millions of dollars			0
as you see , we look like a @entity207 country when we should be looking more like a @entity202 territory			0
" in half a dozen villages either wiped out or badly damaged by the tsunami , @entity2 could find no visible evidence of local government assistance			2
workers from a tuna fish processing plant were helping in one village ; in another , students from an island community college were dredging rubbish out of a stream			0
@entity222 officials distributed tents in other villages			0
children in another village were hauling furniture on their backs to help clear the debris			0
when asked about the seeming lack of local government assistance , the governor told @entity2 , " our departments are out there working and working very hard , and to say they have n't seen any assistance is totally false			0
" since 1995 , @entity1 has received nearly $ 2 billion in federal grants from nearly every federal agency			2
on average the 65,000 - population -- the size of a typical @entity1 suburb -- receives about $ 250 million in federal money each year			2
congressional sources tell @entity2 that oversight has always been a problem because of @entity1 's isolation and the expense involved in even mounting an investigation			1
" they can do half a dozen investigations in @entity251 or @entity252 for the amount just one investigation would cost in @entity1 , " a source told @entity2			1
federal sources said they do n't believe any official is getting rich off the @entity257			0
instead , they said , federal funds -- including disaster - preparedness money that was to have gone to the warning system -- were instead used to create local government jobs in an economy almost totally dependent on @entity202 federal grants			1
moreover , the source added , each federal agency may have many employees whose jobs are to allocate federal funds , but only a relative handful whose jobs are to " manage " or account for that money			0
in an e-mail to @entity2 , an @entity121 spokeswoman said that in previous administrations " there were real issues of neglect and failed oversight that must be addressed quickly , thoroughly and responsibly			0
" " we will help the islands rebuild and recover , " said @entity278 , " but taxpayer dollars will be invested with strong oversight and full accountability			0

34 people died in last month 's tsunami that *smashed* into @entity1
@entity19 inspectors say funds for a warning system were *improperly* diverted
