@entity0 -- four top @entity3 police officers will not face further police investigation in connection with an inquiry into phone hacking by journalists , the @entity9 said wednesday			1
they are former metropolitan police commissioner @entity10 , former assistant commissioners @entity11 and @entity13 and former deputy assistant commissioner @entity14			1
@entity10 resigned as head of @entity0 's @entity16 , also known as @entity17 , after it was revealed that @entity17 had hired a former top @entity20 journalist to be a communications consultant			1
the revelation came the same day police arrested the journalist , @entity24 , over the phone - hacking investigation			2
@entity10 insisted he had done nothing wrong			2
all four officers were referred to the @entity9 by the local police authority after their involvement in the phone - hacking scandal engulfing @entity20 and its parent company , @entity31 , came under scrutiny			1
@entity20 was shut down last month amid allegations its staff had hacked the voice mail of people ranging from celebrities to crime victims , and bribed police			2
@entity41 officers were accused of being too cozy with senior @entity31 staff			1
the @entity9 said in a statement that " in relation to their alleged respective roles in the ' phone hacking ' investigation , the conduct of none of these officers amounts to recordable conduct			0
" @entity9 deputy chair @entity53 said the @entity16 had " rightly come under huge scrutiny " over its role in responding to allegations of phone hacking by @entity20 , @entity3 's best - selling sunday paper			0
" there can be no doubt about the damaging effect of the perceived inadequate response -- in particular , the failure to notify its many apparent victims -- on public confidence			0
sir @entity10 and @entity11 both acknowledged this in their decisions to resign , " she said			1
but , she added , a " clear line must be drawn between what is a recordable conduct matter -- in effect , conduct that is either criminal or for which an officer should be disciplined -- and public concerns that will be addressed and scrutinized by @entity78 's public inquiry			2
" the @entity78 inquiry was set up by prime minister @entity80 to look into the conduct of the @entity3 media and allegations of phone hacking and police corruption			0
@entity10 said the outcome of the @entity9 probe " is as i would have expected it to be			1
" i regret resources have had to be expended on this matter , " he said in a statement			0
@entity11 handed in his resignation the day after @entity10 quit			1
he was the officer who decided in 2009 that there was no need to open a new police investigation into phone hacking , despite the 11,000 pages of evidence sitting at @entity17 -- a decision he later admitted to @entity102 was " crap			1
" the @entity9 said it " would agree that he made a poor decision in 2009 " but said it saw no purpose in questioning him about it again			0
however , @entity11 faces further investigation over his alleged role in securing a police job for @entity24 ' daughter , the @entity9 said			1
@entity11 said he was pleased he would not be scrutinized further over phone hacking but " disappointed " he still faced questions over what he called his " peripheral involvement " in the employment of @entity24 ' daughter			2
" i strongly deny any wrongdoing and i am completely confident that i will be exonerated , " he said in a statement			0
@entity80 has faced questions over his judgment in hiring former @entity20 editor @entity121 as his communications adviser after he resigned from the newspaper			0
@entity121 says he was not aware of wrongdoing while he edited the paper			0
in a statement released wednesday by the prime minister 's @entity128 office , @entity80 said : " clearly if i had known then all the things i know now , then obviously i would have taken different decisions			0
" the @entity9 's decision comes a day after a parliamentary committee examining the phone - hacking allegations at @entity20 released dozens of documents related to its inquiry , reigniting questions over whether @entity31 had tried to cover up what happened			1
among the documents was a 2007 letter from the paper 's former royal correspondent @entity141 -- who was sacked and jailed over intercepting royal voice mail -- to @entity31 executives , in which he says that phone hacking was " widely discussed " at the newspaper until explicit reference to it was " banned by the editor			1
" the editor at the time was @entity121			0
a number of senior @entity31 figures have been asked to give evidence to @entity102 's @entity156 in september			2
@entity121 and others have also been sent letters asking if they wish to add to or amend their previous testimony before the panel			0
@entity1 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity11 says he will be exonerated over a separate investigation
@entity10 resigned as @entity0 's top police officer last month
he says he expected this outcome and regrets police resources were used for the probe
@entity0 's police have been accused of being too cozy with @entity31
