@entity0 -- her big brown eyes , framed by long soft lashes , are wide open as she takes in the unfamiliar surroundings			0
she 's never stepped foot into a place like this , with books , computers , classrooms and musical instruments			2
in fact @entity13 has never been to school , let alone one that looked like this			0
the seven - year old dressed in a blue headscarf and a tattered , red dress , is at @entity22 's @entity21 with her father , @entity23			1
he 's a big man with kind eyes and wears a grey shalwar kameez , @entity22 's traditional dress			1
@entity13 's older brother , nine - year - old @entity27 , is also with them , popping in and out of every nook and cranny , exploring this new and foreign world			2
but as they walk along the hallway , @entity13 refuses to leave her father 's side			2
she is his shadow -- a daddy 's girl			2
it 's right beside him , holding his hand that she feels most comfortable			2
fleeing conflict but last year @entity23 betrayed his little daughter 's trust			1
it began when the family fled the fighting in the country 's southern @entity47			1
@entity23 moved his wife and nine children to a refugee camp on the outskirts of @entity0 thinking this would be a better life			1
but unable to make a living , the family suffered , especially when the brutal winter arrived			0
his wife had to be hospitalized when she fell ill and then his three - year - old son froze to death			1
@entity23 borrowed $ 2,500 to pay for his wife 's medical bills and other family expenses			1
but when he could n't repay the debt he decided the only solution was to marry off @entity13 , then only six , to the money lender 's 19 - year - old son			1
" it was a difficult decision , " @entity23 tells me in a remorseful tone			0
" everyone gives away their child but to give @entity13 away like that was just so hard			0
" when human rights groups found out they were outraged and contacted a @entity77 lawyer @entity76			0
the former beauty queen and mother of three who lives between @entity0 and @entity81 , @entity82 where her family is based , has been working in @entity22 for the past five years			1
she arrived in 2008 as part of a @entity86 program to train and mentor @entity22 defense attorneys			1
anonymous donor while it was only supposed to be a short - term stay , @entity76 realized there was a serious shortage of lawyers and decided to set up a practice			0
while her main clients are foreigners , embassies and corporations , she has made a name for herself with her pro bono work representing victimized @entity22 women			2
when this case came across her desk , @entity76 jumped at it			0
through her contacts and experience in the country , she arranged an assembly of @entity22 elders known as a @entity109 , and managed to get @entity13 out of the marriage and back to her family			1
an anonymous donor then paid off @entity23 's debt			2
" i 'm certainly very happy that @entity13 did not have to be married off at the age of 6 , so i 'm pleased with that , " explains @entity76			0
" but i 'd like to make sure she gets an education and becomes successful			0
" which is the reason why they 're visiting @entity22 's @entity21 -- a school that takes orphans and underprivileged children and is offering placements for both @entity123 and her brother			1
@entity76 who walks through the school with @entity23 and the two children asks them what they think			0
through an interpreter , @entity23 says he likes it very much and would like his children to attend			0
he knows he and his children have been given another a chance			0
" when i could n't pay my debt i felt like i 'd been thrown into the fire and then someone rescued me -- that was @entity139			1
she has been so kind to me i 'm ready to do whatever @entity139 says			0

an @entity22 man and his family flee to a refugee camp amid fighting
he borrows money to pay for his wife 's medical bills
when he ca n't repay the debt he marries off his daughter to the money lender 's son
a lawyer helps get them out of the deal and offers the family another chance
