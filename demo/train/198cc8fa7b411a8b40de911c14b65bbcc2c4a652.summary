-- these are tough times for idealistic revolutionaries			1
pro-democracy protesters in @entity4 know that taking on the @entity6 government has never been an easy task			1
their chance of success gets worse by the day			0
there are signs that this could end badly			0
@entity6 's @entity13 is sending clear messages that it has no intention of yielding to the protesters ' demands , warning of " unimaginable consequences " if the protests do n't end soon			1
the worst case scenario is that these peaceful and highly disciplined protesters could end up crushed by the @entity6 regime just as their predecessors were in 1989 at @entity24			1
yes , the arc of history tends to bend toward justice , but the conditions and timing have to be right			0
based on official statements , @entity6 is in no mood to be pressured to change			2
the international community is too worried about the instability in the @entity34 and too busy to meddle with @entity6 's political problems			1
@entity4 's activists , who were prepared well for this moment and are committed to avoiding violence , have the moral support of people beyond @entity6 's borders , but not much more			1
and @entity6 believes it has little to fear from international reaction			2
when the @entity44 issued mild statements in support of an " open system " and the " highest possible degree of autonomy " for @entity4 , @entity43 promptly shot back that this is @entity6 's internal domestic affair and others should stay out			1
sure , if @entity6 brings about a bloodbath in @entity4 , investors may take their chips and go to @entity55 or other competing regional hubs			1
it is not completely risk - free for @entity43 to go on the offensive against peaceful protesters			0
but @entity6 is controlling the message at home , trying to inoculate the country from a pro-democracy contagion			1
it would rather avoid a nasty confrontation , but it may decide at some point that a prolonged standoff is riskier than a swift violent crackdown			2
@entity6 's highly self - assured president , @entity68 , has three possible courses of action , and all the evidence is that he has ruled out the one leading to compromise			1
instead , he has issued his response in language that signals complete inflexibility			0
the @entity13 newspaper presented @entity68 's position almost as a doctrine , practically written for long - term use			0
they called it " @entity81 , " a determination to continue on the current course of implementing the existing policies of " one country , two systems , " in " advancing democratic development according to the law , " and in " safeguarding long - term prosperity and stability			0
" when @entity6 speaks of safeguarding stability , it means change will come -- if at all -- very slowly and under the complete control of the central government			2
the @entity4 students , in contrast to the @entity98 protesters , are not demanding that @entity6 become a democratic country			1
their demands are much more modest			0
all they want is @entity43 to keep its word			0
when @entity4 stopped being a @entity105 colony to join @entity6 in 1997 , @entity43 agreed voters there would choose their own leaders through universal suffrage by 2017			1
now @entity6 has said all voters in @entity4 can participate in those elections , but they will have to choose between candidates approved by a committee loyal to @entity43 's leaders			1
that 's not true democracy , the protesters say , quite correctly			2
the man who helped negotiate the 1997 handover , the last @entity105 governor of @entity4 , agrees that @entity43 is in brazen violation of the agreement			2
but president @entity68 , who has been adding to his authority and may have already become the most powerful @entity6 leader since @entity124 , is not going to let the masses of democracy - loving people in @entity4 tell him what to do			1
more importantly , he will not allow them to give the rest of @entity6 any crazy ideas about choosing their own leaders or about pressuring the authorities to make concessions by holding protests			2
@entity6 's @entity13 worries about three things over all others : social stability , economic growth and its hold on power			1
they view anything that threatens one of those goals as a challenge to be quashed			0
a mass protest demanding democracy in the most prosperous city in the country -- @entity4 's umbrella revolution -- threatens all three , even if the protesters are not trying to overthrow the @entity13 's rule			1
@entity68 has already been trying to maneuver through an economic slowdown			0
periods of economic uncertainty are the most dangerous times for a political system			0
activists in the mainland say he has already tightened repression and surveillance against dissidents			0
and that was even before the umbrellas came out in @entity4 and volleys of tear gas persuaded tens of thousands of people to come out in support of the young protesters			1
for now , @entity43 is allowing the local government in @entity4 to deal with the crisis			2
but its patience is wearing thin			0
the students are digging in , persuaded of the rightness of their cause			0
if @entity43 does send out the troops -- the @entity176 forces already garrisoned close to where the " umbrella revolution " demonstrators are holding their protests -- international reaction will prove even less determined and more ineffective than it did in @entity43 after that tragic night in @entity98 25 years ago @entity43 knows that if it crushes the protests , there will be little appetite in other countries for major economic sanctions against @entity6			1
both rich and poor economies have become reliant on @entity6 markets			2
if it 's any consolation , this moment is not lost			0
the times are tough for democratic revolution , but history really is on the side of protesters			2
as @entity197 said , history steadily brings the awareness of one 's freedom , followed by its realization			0
@entity4 is gaining that awareness			0
but achieving true democracy will take longer .			0

@entity205 : these are tough times for idealistic pro-democracy protesters in @entity4
@entity209 : let 's hope there wo n't be a repeat of @entity98 violence
she says @entity6 appears *unwilling* to allow flexibility , so protesters have few *options*
@entity209 : even if the standoff leads to @entity6 crackdown , other nations will unlikely to *interfere*
