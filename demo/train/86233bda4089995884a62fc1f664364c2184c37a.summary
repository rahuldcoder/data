-- beyond the golden beaches and beneath the blue waters of the @entity4 island of @entity5 is a site that resembles more of a munitions graveyard than a @entity9 paradise			1
@entity10 measures a 2,000 - pound @entity12 bomb in the waters off the @entity9 island of @entity5			1
hundreds of corroding and unexploded bombs litter the sea floor , leaking toxins and taking a toll on nearby marine life			1
the munitions were left by the @entity12 , which had a training site on @entity5 for six decades			1
" we know that these munitions are leaking cancer - causing materials and endangering sea life , " said marine ecologist @entity10 , associate dean of the @entity23 at the @entity24 , who recently completed a research trip to @entity5			1
responding to a request by the governor 's office of @entity4 , @entity10 tested the island 's waters for the presence of radioactive material surrounding the sunken @entity39 , a @entity41 - era destroyer used as target practice for @entity12 missiles			2
instead , @entity10 stumbled upon another finding : cancer			0
he discovered that feather duster worms , sea urchins and various types of coral found near bombs and bomb fragments contained high levels of carcinogenic material -- in some cases 100,000 times more than what is considered safe for commercially edible seafood			1
" we have not yet traced these contaminants from the reef to the dinner table , but we definitely know these contaminants are in the marine ecosystem , " he said			0
@entity10 was scheduled to present his findings thursday at the @entity64 on @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			1
the conference brings together scientists , military officials and underwater technology companies to discuss how to identify and clean up hazardous undersea munitions dumps from the @entity9 to the @entity74			1
" any country that has a coastline and has ever had war is going to be a place where you can find this problem , " said @entity10 , who warns that removing underwater munitions takes careful planning			2
" if you pick up a bomb , you pick up a problem			0
" @entity5 , which lies just east of @entity4 's mainland , has had a long history of @entity90 military involvement			2
the @entity12 used the island as its main @entity93 training site for 60 years before pulling out in 2003			0
in 2005 , the @entity94 designated portions of @entity5 a @entity96 site , classified under a federal program to clean up the nation 's hazardous waste			2
the @entity12 has allocated an estimated $ 350 million in recent years to clean up areas of @entity5 where unexploded bombs could come into contact with residents or tourists , said @entity105 , head of the @entity12 's @entity106			1
but these efforts so far have been limited to the land and shoreline			0
@entity5 is one of many ocean sites around the world affected by abandoned ordnances , said scientists and military officials			1
" in the @entity90 and countries around the world going back to @entity41 , it was common practice to ... take munitions to a site well offshore and dispose of [ them ] , " said @entity115 , deputy assistant secretary of the army for @entity116			2
that changed in 1982 , when the @entity125 passed the @entity126 , which made it illegal for countries to dump excess weapons in open waters			2
but cleaning up after history has its own unique challenges			0
one of the many political and environmental obstacles to addressing this issue is the lack of a munitions " map			2
" there is no national or international registry that can pinpoint where these dump sites are , @entity10 said			0
many of the bombs also have been corroded by saltwater over decades , making it more difficult for restoration crews to identify and safely remove them			2
toxic elements such as @entity147 , mustard gas and the chemical weapon @entity150 also can be hard to detect in large bodies of water			0
" it is a combination of looking at the safety , health and environmental risks and establishing levels for the cleanup , " said the @entity153 's @entity115			0
one highlight of this week 's conference in @entity66 is the @entity153 's plan to remove old explosive rounds dumped in the shallow waters of @entity165 off @entity167 's @entity166 , an area known as @entity168			1
the @entity153 has allocated about $ 4 million to clean up the area , which is estimated to hold more than 2,000 explosives			0
" what we 're going to attempt to do is look at those munitions in the water that have the greatest potential for harm for people and the environment and to go after those first , " said @entity115			0
conventional and chemical weapons have historically been detonated or left to corrode , which presents a challenge when cleaning up ordnances from the sea floor			1
but a retired @entity12 bomb - disposal technician has invented a remotely operated vehicle he says can find , collect and dispose of these munitions in a safe way			1
@entity188 calls his prototype an @entity190			0
the machine picks up unexploded bombs off the sea floor and delivers them to a lift basket for surface disposal or deep - sea burial			1
it is operated remotely with toggle switches and relies on an underwater hydraulic system designed by @entity188 , president of @entity201 " i built this technology to help this problem , because people want these munitions out of the water , " @entity188 said			1
scientists and military officials hope @entity10 's findings and @entity188 's device will help bring attention to an environmental problem that for years has been out of sight , out of mind			0
" the environmental cost , preparation and training for war has huge environmental impacts that normally are not considered , " @entity10 said			0
" we normally think of this kind of defense as national security			0
but in the long term we live on one planet , and taking care of that is maybe our best self - preservation and self - defense			0

scientists are *concerned* about corroding , unexploded bombs that litter the sea floor
high carcinogen levels found in creatures near bombs in waters off @entity5
a conference this week in @entity67 will address how to remove undersea munitions
inventor has developed a remotely operated vehicle to dispose of undersea bombs
