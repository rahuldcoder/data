@entity0 -- it 's not just about the website anymore			0
@entity5 foes of @entity6 still use words like " disaster " and " epic " failure in describing the problems with @entity11 , the portal for enrolling in president @entity14 's signature health care reforms			1
however , they also concede the technology problems will likely get resolved , as promised again wednesday by @entity18 secretary @entity17 at a @entity20 hearing			1
the broader @entity5 focus is on their dislike for the @entity6 , passed in 2010 with no @entity5 support and upheld last year by the @entity25			1
at wednesday 's hearing , @entity5 accused @entity14 of lying to the @entity28 people in selling the reforms and railed against the impacts , including individual policyholders getting cancellation notices and premium prices rising in some areas			1
@entity14 's oft - repeated pledge that people could keep coverage they liked was " simply untrue , " said @entity5 sen. @entity38 of @entity39 , while his conservative colleague sen. @entity40 of @entity41 called it a " false statement made to the @entity28 people			1
" @entity14 , @entity45 meet with @entity46 @entity47 : @entity14 ' ca n't go back ' and change @entity6 vow when @entity40 and fellow @entity5 sen. @entity50 of @entity51 pushed @entity17 on whether @entity14 's statement was true or false , she repeated the administration 's response that a grandfather clause included in the legislation allows people to keep policies that were in place before the law was signed more than three years ago			1
the matter involves a relatively small segment of the insurance market -- the 5 % of @entity28 who buy individual policies , unlike the vast majority who get their coverage through their jobs or government programs such as @entity71 , @entity72 and others			0
while only a sliver of the overall market , it still involves 12 million people , including more than 1 million who have received letters from their insurers telling them current policies are being discontinued			0
@entity17 said wednesday that the goal of the health care reforms known as @entity6 was to ensure everyone has minimum standards of coverage , which did n't exist in the individual market before the reforms			1
she said @entity14 's pledge that people can keep policies they liked -- which @entity40 and @entity50 noted remained on the @entity93 website on wednesday -- was mostly in reference to the 80 % of @entity28 getting coverage from employer and federal programs , as well as some in the individual markets			2
@entity14 further alters ' you can keep your plan ' pledge that was insufficient for @entity40 , who questioned why no one had lost their job so far over the botched website launch on october 1 or false statements by administration officials on people losing health coverage			1
" the only thing i can conclude is that it is impossible to do something in this administration that gets you fired			0
it is impossible , " he said			0
" you can lie to the @entity28 people			0
you can consistently misrepresent the facts , but it is impossible to get fired			0
" debunking 4 @entity6 myths : both sides get it wrong @entity14 went to @entity41 on wednesday to meet with " navigators " -- people hired to help @entity28 obtain health insurance through the newly established federal and state marketplaces			1
he spoke about his frustrations with the website			0
in @entity136 , @entity14 reassures that website fix is coming " this is like having a really good product in a store , and the cash registers do n't work , and there are n't enough parking spots , and nobody can get through the door , " the president said			1
" we are working overtime to get this fixed and the website is already better than it was at the beginning of october			1
and by the end of this month , we anticipate that it is going to be working the way it is supposed to , " @entity14 said			2
back in @entity0 , @entity40 asked @entity17 if the thousands of navigators had been properly screened			2
@entity17 said a background check was not required for navigators on the federal exchange , noting such screening also was n't federally required for insurance agents			2
" so a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual unbeknownst to them ? " @entity40 asked			0
" that is possible , " @entity17 responded			0
" we have contracts for the organizations and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job ... but it is possible			0
" @entity17 also came under fire from a fellow @entity175 , @entity5 sen. @entity176 , who said she should resign because of the website woes and other @entity6 problems			1
" more people are losing their insurance than signing up on the website , " @entity176 said , adding that the resulting limbo " means the difference between life and death for many @entity28 who are at a loss for what to do			0
" @entity17 called the website problems unacceptable and said they were being fixed , declaring herself accountable for the troubled launch			1
at the same time , she said an " even higher level of accountability " existed involving the tens of millions of @entity28 previously ineligible or unable to afford health insurance who now can get coverage because of @entity6			1
obamacare : it 's about government , future elections " the impact on the lives of everyday people is getting lost , " @entity17 said of the torrid political debate spurred by the website problems and persistent @entity5 efforts to undermine the law passed with no @entity5 votes in 2010 and upheld by the @entity25 last year			1
asked how many people had enrolled so far , @entity17 repeated that figures for the first month would be made public next week and that they would be less than originally anticipated because of the website problems that hindered the ability of large numbers to sign up			2
" our early enrollment numbers are going to be very low , " she said			0
she rejected calls by @entity5 and some @entity46 up for re-election next year to delay implementation of @entity6 's vital individual mandate that requires people to have health coverage or get fined			1
" delaying the @entity6 would n't delay people 's cancer or diabetes or @entity223 's , " she said			0
" ... delaying the @entity6 does n't delay the foreclosure notices for families forced into bankruptcy by unpayable medical bills			0
it does n't delay the higher costs all of us pay when uninsured @entity28 are left with no choice but to rely on emergency rooms for care			0
so for millions of @entity28 , delay is not an option			0
people 's lives depend on this			0
" the @entity93 announced that @entity14 met wednesday with @entity46 to discuss concerns about @entity6 , particularly that the website problems will prevent people from signing up in time for new coverage			1
one participant , sen. @entity243 of @entity244 , said he urged @entity14 " to extend the enrollment period to give consumers enough time to make an informed decision about their family 's health insurance options			2
" @entity243 also said he pushed for assurances that information submitted to the @entity11 website would be protected , a concern stressed by fellow @entity46 and @entity5 at wednesday 's hearing			2
it was the second hearing in a week in which @entity17 got grilled by legislators over the website problems and the overall reforms			1
earlier : 5 things we learned from @entity17 @entity46 agreed that the website must get fixed as quickly as possible , repeating the " unacceptable " label used by @entity17 and @entity5 for the inability to log in , lengthy delays , error messages and other problems that occurred with the launch of @entity11			1
however , they also backed the health care reforms and called for @entity5 to work together to fix problems instead of seeking to wipe out the law			2
" those who seek to ascribe blame are the same folks who have spent every waking hour of the last four years working to dismantle , destroy , obstruct and impede the success of the @entity6 , " said @entity274 sen. @entity273 of @entity275			2
noting that similar attacks faced the advent and launch of other social welfare advances in the past such as @entity284 and @entity71 , @entity273 noted those programs now were popular as part of a government safety net for elderly citizens			0
@entity5 opponents of @entity6 , he said , were " concerned not about its failure , they 're concerned about its success			2
" website goes dark nightly for fix - it work meanwhile , the official in charge of technology at the federal agency that developed the @entity11 website is leaving the government for a private - sector job , according to an internal e-mail			1
chief information officer @entity305 's departure from the @entity306 is effective november 15 , according to the email by chief operating officer @entity308			0
asked if @entity305 was being pushed out due to his role in the @entity6 website 's development , @entity310 communications director @entity309 declined to elaborate			1
" @entity305 made a decision that he was going to move to the private sector and that is what our coo announced yesterday , " @entity309 told reporters on wednesday			0
@entity1 's @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 and @entity322 contributed to this report .			0
