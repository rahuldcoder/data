, in which a couple must come to grips with some trippy impediment to their relationship , such as life after death or a hole in the space - time continuum			1
@entity17 and @entity18 star as a couple trying to connect in " @entity3			1
" only instead of being milked for elaborate science - fiction thrills , the problem at hand gets treated as a weepy and grandiose inconvenience			0
sort of like the metaphysical version of having a husband who takes too many business trips			0
@entity27 ( @entity18 ) is deeply , and eternally , in love with @entity29 ( @entity17 ) , and she with him			1
the only problem is that he has a " genetic anomaly " that causes him to skip around through time without warning			2
all of a sudden , he will melt out of the present and pop up ... somewhere else , in the future or in the past , without a stitch of clothing on , so that he must scramble for cover and regain his bearings			0
then , just as suddenly , he 'll pop back into @entity29 's life -- sometimes when he 's too young a man to have any idea who she is			2
( a little confused ? so was i. ) more jarringly , he sometimes appears when he 's an adult and she 's an adoring young girl standing in a pastoral meadow			0
that 's when she falls in love with him -- which is meant to be innocent , but comes off as a bit unintentionally creepy			0
i mean , is the movie supposed to look like a contemporary version of " the @entity53 " ? to muddle matters further , @entity27 is seen at assorted ages , but except for the moment when he shows up at his wedding with sudden streaks of gray in his hair , @entity18 looks exactly the same in every scene			1
" @entity3 " is built as a game that the audience learns to play , and after a while , yes , we do get the hang of it			1
that is , we accept the film 's mixture of the playful and the slightly arbitrary ; we become romantic time travelers too			2
although the script is by @entity73 , who wrote " ghost , " the film 's mood does n't change very much ; it 's gentle , wistful , gauzy , and placid			0
@entity18 , so fantastic in " @entity78 , " has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the @entity82 gym - rat version of @entity84 's " @entity83 " can play a gentle , unassuming regular guy			1
but he does nicely here			0
he and @entity17 are sweet together , with matching dimples and starry eyes , and we grow eager to see them remain in the same place			1
in the end , that 's all there is to the movie , really			2
it 's a time - travel fantasy in search of a cozy love seat			1

*chemistry* between @entity18 , @entity17 saves " @entity3 "
movie about man who can travel through time , *hurting* chances for romance
a lot is silly , just waiting for the couple to get together at the right time
