-- " @entity3 " was awoken to the tune of $ 56.3 million this weekend , according to studio estimates			1
that 's a big win for @entity5 , especially considering that the studio 's last film , the sinking big - budget bomb known as " @entity9 , " opened to less than half that amount two weeks ago			1
" @entity18 " also marked the best debut for star @entity12 outside the " @entity14 " franchise , and the second - best start for @entity16 after " @entity17			2
" the film skewed female , but just barely , as 53 percent of its crowd consisted of women			2
the @entity23 revisionist fairy tale was also pretty evenly split between younger and older moviegoers , with 52 percent being at least 30 years old			2
audiences liked but did n't love the film , which received an okay " b " rating from @entity29 participants			1
considering that @entity5 spent $ 170 million producing the picture , " @entity18 " needs to hold moderately well the next few weeks			1
but even if the movie does n't wind up being a huge moneymaker , it at least avoided the fate of " @entity9 " and is the first major post- " @entity36 " flick to exceed industry expectations			1
in second place , " @entity38 " held up fairly well , dropping 46 percent for $ 29.3 million			0
the $ 230 million threequel has so far earned $ 112.3 million domestically in 10 days -- just slightly behind where " @entity42 " ( $ 118.8 million ) and " @entity43 " ( $ 115.6 million ) were at the same point -- and an impressive $ 386.9 million worldwide			0
of course , that 's nothing compared to " @entity36 , " which fell 45 percent for $ 20.3 million and walked away with two notable achievements			1
first , the @entity47 superhero movie passed " @entity49 's " $ 533.3 million tally to become the third - highest - grossing domestic release ever , behind only " @entity51 " ( $ 760.5 million ) and @entity52 ( $ 658.6 million )			1
while " @entity36 " should be able to reach the $ 600 million mark , it 'll almost certainly fall short of those two @entity56 productions			1
still , no. 3 is not a bad place to be , especially when you 're also talking about the worldwide record board			0
over the weekend , " @entity36 " passed " @entity61 and the @entity62 -- part 2 " to become the third biggest movie ever globally			1
the movie has so far smashed $ 1.36 billion worldwide			2
@entity67 again , third place is likely where it 'll stay , as " @entity51 " and " @entity52 " are way out in front with $ 2.78 billion and $ 2.19 billion , respectively			0
rounding out the top five were " battleship " and " @entity72 " with $ 4.8 million and $ 4.7 million			0
in limited release , @entity77 's critically acclaimed " @entity76 " continued to dominate , collecting $ 849,000 at just 16 theaters for a per - location average of $ 53,000			0
the @entity79 historical drama " @entity82 , " starring @entity80 and @entity81 , settled for a decent $ 1.8 million at 757 theaters			0
but the horror - comedy sequel " @entity84 " mustered only $ 179,000 at 86 locations , while the @entity87 comedy " @entity88 " flunked out with just $ 80,600 at 200 sites -- that 's $ 403 per theater			0
if one assumes each theater played " @entity88 " five times per day , then each screening was attended by an average of three moviegoers			0
" @entity3 " -- $ 56.3 mil 2			1
" @entity38 " -- $ 29.3 mil 3			0
" @entity36 " -- $ 20.3 mil 4			1
" battleship " -- $ 4.8 mil 5			0
" the dictator " -- $ 4.7 mil see full story at @entity0			0
