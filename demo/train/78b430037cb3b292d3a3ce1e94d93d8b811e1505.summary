-- " one of these mothers from @entity3 should do an @entity5 moment ; show the picture of their child dead in the classroom			1
" that 's a text i received earlier this week from my tv one show producer			2
when i got it , a chill immediately went through my body just thinking about the possibility of seeing the carnage in such a photo			1
when taping this week 's edition of my show , " @entity23 , " @entity20 / @entity19 host @entity18 somberly said the same thing			2
@entity18 remarked that @entity5 's mother , @entity25 , insisted on an open casket for her son so the world could see what was done to him by racists in @entity31			1
many @entity32 may not even remember @entity5 , a precocious 14 - year - old black teenager from @entity33 who went to visit his family in @entity31			1
he allegedly flirted with a white woman in a store , and the woman 's husband and his brother later went to the home where @entity5 was staying , pulled him out of his bed , took him somewhere and beat him to a pulp , gouged out his eye , blew the back of his head away with a gun , attached a cotton gin with barbed wire around his neck and dumped his body in the @entity51			1
when his bloated and disfigured body was recovered , it was unrecognizable			2
he was identified based on a ring he always wore			2
when @entity56 and the @entity58 newspaper published his battered face on their covers , it sent shock waves throughout @entity32 , and especially in the black community			1
the brutality of lynchings were talked about and covered , yet for the world to witness with its own eyes the end result of vicious bigotry , it forced the nation to examine its conscience			2
" there was just no way i could describe what was in that box , " @entity25 said			0
and i just wanted the world to see			0
" in the wake of the @entity79 , @entity3 , mass shooting , we have seen numerous photos of the beautiful , smiling faces of the 20 children and six adults slaughtered at @entity79			0
the images we have become accustomed to include them singing at a piano , sporting the gear of a favorite sports team and others			0
when we think of them being memorialized it 's in the context of teddy bears , candles and flowers			0
@entity32 want to remember them as vibrant and fun - loving children , but will that actually shake the conscience of @entity32 to do something about how they were gunned down in the classroom ? what if one of the mothers or fathers of the @entity105 demanded that police give them a crime scene photo of their child and they chose to show it to the world ? can you imagine a modern day @entity114 , wracked with pain but filled with resolve to show the nation so they could bear witness to what hate did to their child ? the great divide : little common ground with pro- and anti-gun forces i can tell you that i 've talked to numerous black men and women who to this day remember august 28 , 1955 , the day @entity5 was murdered			1
the image of his face has been seared into their brain for life as a result of seeing that photo			2
is that what @entity32 need today ? maybe so			1
for too many of us , we hear about gun violence , we talk about it , we mourn it , but to be honest , we 've never witnessed it			1
our senses have been dulled to the real world carnage			2
we demand that news organizations not show @entity32 troops , or even the enemy , lying dead in war zones			1
even when our troops returned home in flag - draped coffins , the @entity150 administration forbade it from being covered by the media			0
the @entity156 was ripped by readers for showing the bloody , lifeless body of ambassador @entity159 being dragged out of a building in @entity161 , @entity162			0
what does that say about @entity32 ? oh , let 's talk about tragedy , but please , please , please do n't show the real results			1
we love blood and guts in our movies , preferring exploding heads , chests ripped open by gunfire			0
we adore the big explosions , bodies flying through the air , buildings tumbling down			0
we 'll drop millions of dollars collectively on movies and video games to see the carnage , but @entity181 forbid we are forced to see it in real life			2
the land of make believe			0
show us the fake stuff , but let 's retreat into a fetal position and scream , " no ! no ! no ! " when forced to see the real thing			0
when my producer sent me that text , i recoiled at even the mere mention of seeing with my own eyes the real life results of what a @entity197 semi-automatic rifle could do to a 6 - year - old body			0
but maybe i should see it			0
maybe @entity201 of the @entity202 should have to answer to such a photo when he is interviewed			0
maybe if a modern day @entity114 met with members of @entity206 and forced them to look at a photo of her baby , then we would see some political courage			0
maybe if all @entity32 had to bear witness to such a photo , we would stop ignoring the violence equivalent to the @entity79 massacres that is happening in @entity33 , @entity215 and other cities across this country			1
gun violence is a national epidemic			1
it affects all ages and races			0
maybe it 's time for @entity32 to see the results of what our gun culture has wrought			1
enough with our delicate sensibilities			0
if we truly want to confront the problem , then we 'd better have the guts to see the problem			0
when we 've had such tragedies in the past , there was always an initial outcry , and then we 'd settle back into our routines			0
when that image of @entity5 was shown to the world , it stirred up such a burning desire for justice inside african - americans that it was a part of the foundation of the civil rights movement			1
just three months later the @entity244 began , and many african - americans will tell you that @entity5 's gruesome lynching was the catalyst			1
@entity5 's death was the moment that led to a movement , and 57 years later , we still talk about his death , largely because of that photo			1
maybe the only way @entity79 never leaves our conscience and fades away like @entity256 or @entity257 is if we have to look at the results of the tragedy to ensure that this moment leads to a transformational movement			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			1

@entity263 : the cost of gun violence is often hidden away
he says @entity32 should see the carnage *firsthand* so they are stirred to act
after murder of @entity5 , his battered face was shown on magazine covers
@entity263 says *ourtrage* over the @entity5 murder helped fuel civil rights movement
