@entity0 -- negotiations to end a mass hunger strike by up to 2,000 palestinians detained by @entity6 are making progress and a resolution may be only days away , @entity3 officials said saturday			1
the talks over the detainee demands involve @entity3 , @entity6 officials and @entity13 mediators			1
" we have been informed by the @entity13 mediators that there is a very close deal to be reached in the coming hours or maybe by tomorrow , " said @entity14 , an @entity15 leader and spokesman			0
between 1,600 and 2,000 @entity3 are protesting prison conditions and administrative detention , a controversial @entity6 military practice that allows authorities to detain people indefinitely			1
@entity24 , a spokesman for the @entity25 of detainees and @entity27 , told @entity1 he was aware of progress in the negotiations , but did not know the details			2
the head of the @entity32 , @entity31 , said a deal had not been reached , but pressure to resolve the standoff included @entity37 and @entity38 officials			0
a senior @entity6 official on saturday would say only that talks to end the impasse were ongoing			2
@entity6 's high court on monday rejected an appeal requesting the release of two @entity3 prisoners who have been on a hunger strike for nearly two and a half months , an attorney representing them said			1
judges ruled that the two men , @entity50 and @entity51 , remained a security risk to @entity6 , and that their hunger strike was not a reason to release them from administrative detention , according to lawyer @entity56			1
" if any harm happens to the prisoners especially to @entity59 and @entity60 and @entity61 and all the other prisoners , @entity6 should be responsible and bare the consequences and consider that the truce is no longer binding , " said @entity14			2
the @entity6 military 's detention process also allows for detention based on secret evidence , and there is no requirement to charge the detainees or to allow them to stand trial			1
@entity50 and @entity76 , members of the @entity75 - based militant group @entity15 , are both in custody under administrative detention			0
@entity50 has been in custody for nine months , while @entity76 has been in custody for 22 months			0
on sunday , @entity79 said his clients were nearing death and accused the @entity6 high court of procrastinating in delivering a ruling			0
" i believe what the court is doing here is trying to break the will of both prisoners so they will back down in their hunger strike , " he said			1
an @entity6 foreign ministry spokesman , @entity92 , told @entity1 that both men " were arrested for their direct involvement in promoting terror " and suggested that administrative detention constituted " the only available means to thwart the danger " the men posed to @entity6			0
@entity101 , a project coordinator for @entity102 , an @entity6 group advocating on behalf of the hunger striking prisoners , said both prisoners " are in a life - threatening condition " and continued to refuse to be given minerals or liquids			2
more than 4,500 @entity3 prisoners are in @entity6 prisons for a variety of offenses , ranging from rock - throwing to murder			1
of these , about 300 are being held in administrative detention , according to rights groups			0
the vast majority of prisoners refusing to eat began their protest april 17 , while a handful have been without food for longer			0
while hunger strikes are not a new tactic of @entity3 resistance , a series of recent high - profile cases has brought increased attention to the practice and served as a rallying cry for @entity3 , who have staged multiple protests in the @entity132 and @entity75 in support of prisoners			2
besides the administrative detention policy , the @entity3 detainees ' principal demands are an end to solitary confinement , arbitrary night raids and what they term indecent searches of prisoners			1
they also want access to educational material , improved food and access to television			0
they also want family members living in @entity75 to be permitted to visit			0
a committee representing prisoners must approve any proposed agreement in order for the hunger strike to end			1
@entity1 's @entity156 and @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
