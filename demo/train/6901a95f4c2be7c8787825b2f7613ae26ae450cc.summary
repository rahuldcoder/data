momentum in the @entity1 may be building for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill after a border security deal was announced this week , but @entity7 @entity6 opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president 's desk , and that opposition only appears to be hardening			1
@entity1 immigration deal includes tougher border security the messy demise of the farm bill on the @entity7 floor on thursday demonstrated the divisions within @entity6 ranks and the willingness of dozens of rank - and - file members to ignore their leadership			1
while there 's not a clear parallel between that bill 's failure and the road ahead for immigration reform , the episode does underline the exceedingly tough task house speaker @entity32 , @entity33 , faces as he attempts to guide immigration legislation through the @entity7			1
@entity32 insists he wants to tackle immigration reform , but has n't been clear about how he intends to navigate the controversial issue through his own conference			1
@entity38 poll : big generational divide in immigration battle " after all this talk about the @entity1 there has been so little focus on the @entity7 and that it has been , pre-farm vote -- and will continue to be post-farm vote -- the choke point for any immigration reform , " @entity41 , national editor of the @entity42 told @entity38			1
@entity7 @entity6 leaders knew many conservatives would vote against the farm bill because they viewed the food - stamp programs as too expensive			1
but 62 members , roughly a quarter of all @entity54 , broke with @entity32 , who made a rare endorsement of the bill , and joined with the vast majority of @entity7 @entity58 to take down the bill			1
even if @entity58 produced the level of support @entity6 say they anticipated , @entity6 leaders still did n't have support within their own ranks to get the farm bill through			1
the farm bill 's defeat " exposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the @entity7 , " @entity66 added			1
but even before the farm bill fiasco @entity32 began pouring cold water on the immigration momentum coming out of the @entity1			1
as news was breaking on the @entity1 deal on thursday morning @entity32 compared immigration reform to @entity78 , the bill @entity6 constantly malign as the prime example of government overreach			1
" every day as @entity78 is being implemented , @entity82 are reminded of what happens when you have big legislation rammed through @entity86 with minimum support , " @entity32 said at his weekly news conference			2
" @entity82 ' confidence in their government is near an all - time low , so if immigration reform is going to work it 's essential that we have the confidence of the @entity82 people and that it 's done the right way , " the speaker added			2
the deliberate move to put immigration in the same category as @entity78 showed @entity32 is in no mood to muscle through a massive immigration overhaul unless it can garner significant votes from both sides of the aisle -- a tall order in the @entity7			1
@entity32 did n't comment directly on the new " border surge " provisions that would double the number of agents on the @entity82 - @entity111 border or the new money to construct a 700 - mile - long fence			0
but he raised questions on whether that plan would be enough to address concerns among conservatives , saying , " if we 're going to get the kind of bipartisan support i think we need , and we 're not going to get that confidence unless the @entity82 people look up and say , ' yes , this border security package meets the straight - face test			0
' " another key @entity7 @entity6 player on immigration reform , @entity126 chairman @entity125 , @entity127 , was skeptical that the @entity1 's border security plan was going to work , telling reporters , " just throwing bodies at it " does not solve the problem			1
@entity125 said the larger issue is addressing the 35 % -45 % of the 11 million people in the @entity82 without legal status who he says enter the country lawfully -- through visas , but are allowed to overstay or gain a waiver to remain			0
he argued there has to be a bigger emphasis on interior enforcement programs			0
and @entity125 repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a " step by step " process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the @entity1 is considering			2
@entity150 : border security push is a joke " anything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border i would n't support it , " @entity154 @entity153 rep. @entity153 said when asked by @entity38 about the @entity1 's new border security plan			0
@entity153 said he could support additional resources but said he wanted " a guarantee " that enforcement measures in fact worked , and he thought what the @entity1 was doing would end up speeding up eventual citizenship for undocumented workers , something he said was unacceptable			0
" i do n't have any confidence that it 's ever going to be implemented , " @entity170 @entity169 rep. @entity169 told @entity38 when asked about the @entity1 border security plan , saying he did n't believe secretary of homeland security @entity172 would follow the law			0
the dynamic inside the @entity176 on immigration could be seen outside the @entity178 on wednesday afternoon with two groups delivering polar opposite messages about immigration policy			0
@entity183 chair @entity182 , @entity184 , held a news conference with several @entity54 and a group of @entity188 religious leaders and stressed the party 's outreach efforts to @entity191 on immigration			0
just yards away , the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship -- branded " amnesty " -- could be heard at an event @entity169 organized			0
@entity32 already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of @entity7 republicans			2
but even if he gets more than half of the 234 house @entity6 members , he 'll still needs to rely on @entity206 @entity205 to get most of her members on board to pass a bill			2
@entity58 support for immigration reform has never been in question			0
but @entity7 @entity6 congressional aides , still incensed about the failure of the farm bill , question whether @entity58 on @entity217 are more focused on scoring political points in the next election than joining with them to pass a bill			1
" how are we supposed to trust a promise or a whip count from @entity7 @entity58 now ? " one senior @entity7 @entity6 leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill 's defeat means on immigration			1
@entity66 noted that all along many @entity6 on the @entity229 have been suspicious about how serious congressional @entity58 were about actually getting an immigration bill over the finish line			0
" it speaks to this deep seeded belief among many @entity6 that @entity58 are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014 , " @entity66 explained to @entity38			0
the @entity1 could be on track to pass its immigration package before july 4 , but the bipartisan group in the @entity7 that has been working for months on a similar proposal has n't been able to finalize their deal yet			0
the @entity126 has begun working on more narrow proposals aimed at enforcement and security , and those could come up for votes as early as next month			0
even those in the @entity7 who are pressing for major immigration reform say it 's unlikely to play out in the @entity7 until later this fall			2
but that schedule poses difficult decisions for @entity32 about how to move immigration as it comes around the same time as the @entity7 has to deal with an equally divisive issue -- addressing how to deal with the country 's debt limit			2
@entity254 urges final push on immigration reform			0

opposition to immigration reform appears to be hardening in the @entity7
failure to pass farm bill in the @entity7 demonstrated divisions in @entity6 ranks
roughly a quarter of @entity54 broke ranks with speaker @entity32
@entity32 recently compared immigration reform to @entity78
