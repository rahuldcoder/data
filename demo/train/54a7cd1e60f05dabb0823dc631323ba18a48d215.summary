@entity0 -- borrowed place , borrowed time			1
that was the mantra in @entity0 as the clock ticked down to the @entity7 colony being handed back to @entity8 in 1997			1
and as the handover loomed , @entity9 were frantic to make money to get a passport before the communist mainland reclaimed the territory			1
they feared an end to the free - wheeling ways of capitalism where money brought power , prestige -- and if needed , an escape route			0
but there was a small , vocal minority who talked instead about the tail wagging the dog			0
far from being subsumed by @entity8 's political system , @entity0 would in fact lead it towards democracy			1
why ? because , if this handover worked , it could lure a much bigger prize in the form of @entity35			0
if democracy , prosperity and personal freedoms flourished in this territory , @entity35 could be induced to rejoin @entity8 after its seminal split in 1949			1
opinion : why @entity42 is courting trouble but events of the past week have been a watershed in @entity0 's political development			1
the ultimate goal of universal suffrage -- one person , one vote -- has been subverted			0
yes , there will be one person , one vote , but @entity42 has said they want to control who @entity0 's voters are allowed to vote for			1
@entity8 's leadership has made it crystal clear that any form of democracy will only come attached to very powerful @entity8 characteristics			1
@entity0 's first chief executive , @entity62 , who stepped down early after massive protests against his leadership , this week called @entity42 's move towards democracy " real and substantive			1
" it 's hard to see how			0
if anything , @entity42 has slammed the door on a true democratic process , one that allows anyone to stand for election			2
@entity0 's pro-democracy politicians have said they will veto any proposal that does n't allow for full suffrage , leaving the @entity75 back at square one			2
muted reaction yet @entity0 has hardly exploded in anger or frustration			2
in fact the reaction has been almost muted			0
@entity81 with @entity82 and @entity83 , a protest group committed to true universal suffrage , had threatened a campaign of bringing business in downtown @entity0 to a standstill if @entity8 did n't allow for a more democratic process			1
in june , it conducted an unofficial referendum on the issue			0
nearly 800,000 people out of a population of seven million took part despite , or perhaps because of , repeated and sophisticated cyber-attacks and overt criticism from @entity42			2
but the strategy of trying to win concessions from @entity42 failed			0
and in an extraordinary admission just after @entity42 made its ruling on sunday , a leader of the @entity102 , @entity103 , in an interview with @entity105 , conceded support for their cause was sliding			1
" the number of people joining us ( for a long - planned sit - in protest ) will not be as big as we expect , because of the very pragmatic thinking of @entity0 people , " he admitted			2
in many ways it comes back that same mindset in the run - up to the handover			0
before 1997 , the pragmatists were doing what they could to have a @entity126 -- a way of getting out of @entity0 if they needed to -- or working hard to ingratiate themselves with @entity42			1
game of ' chicken ' today they are apparently not prepared to take on @entity42 in an eyeball - to - eyeball standoff			0
as @entity137 , a professor of political science at @entity139 , said , " if this was a game of chicken , the mainland has said : ' we 'll drive straight through this ' and @entity81 has pulled aside and replied , ' we are n't willing to destroy @entity0			2
' " but it may not be over yet			0
@entity0 street demonstrations have a habit of morphing into a general protest against a range of issues from politics to working conditions to environmental concerns			0
@entity149 remain a powerful driving force			0
if the economy starts to fade , if unemployment starts to rise , it can become a catalyst for a much broader range of protesters			0
and neither @entity42 nor @entity0 's leadership can ill - afford to ignore them .			1

@entity42 recently said no to @entity0 voting for its leaders without *approval*
one pro-democracy leader in @entity0 admitted support for their campaign may be sliding
in 1997 @entity9 were frantic to get a passport before @entity8 reclaimed the territory
others talked about @entity0 helping to *encourage* democracy in the mainland
