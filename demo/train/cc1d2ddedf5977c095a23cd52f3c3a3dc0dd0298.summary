it 's 3:15 a.m. under the bright lights of the waterfront @entity4 warehouse in @entity6 , @entity7 , tails twitch and bodies writhe in defiance of the onset of death			1
the floor is awash with seawater as @entity14 moves down a line of 20 boxes , each containing about 15 puffer fish of varying values , lengths and states of coveted plumpness			1
" @entity23 ! @entity27 ! " he chants , as 20 or so interested parties put their hands up to bid			0
the puffer fish , or " fugu " in @entity7 , gulp in more air , ballooning out their white belly sacs			1
@entity6 is @entity7 's fugu capital			1
its @entity36 market is said to be the only one in the country that specializes in the infamous @entity7 delicacy , famed both for its high price tag and lethal insides			1
throughout the fishing season from early september to april 29 , the market is open six mornings a week in the ancient port , 1,126 kilometers west of @entity45 in @entity47 's most southwesterly part of @entity48			1
for 15 years , 55 - year - old @entity14 has been the chief auctioneer ( " seri " or " sekagi " ) here			0
" my job is unusual , " says @entity14			0
" grown men squeeze my hand and fingers			0
they touch me every morning ! it 's the traditional way of fugu bidding			1
" i hold my slipover sleeve or ' fukuro zeri ' out to them and they put their hands inside and tell me how much they want to pay			0
it 's all done by finger pressure			2
" ancient @entity64 bowling fish ? when the auction is over , the sold fugu is packed into polystyrene boxes and taken away to the city 's 10 processing factories			1
all are specially licensed to prepare and detoxify the fish in accordance with @entity7 law			1
it 's an important step , given fugu is hundreds of times more poisonous than cyanide , containing enough toxin in its liver alone to kill five men			1
@entity80 's @entity79 says puffer fish are the second most poisonous vertebrate in the world after the golden poison frog			1
the ovaries , roe and kidneys are just as deadly as the liver -- all of which are incinerated after processing			1
one milligram of the fugu 's tetrodotoxin is enough to bring on an agonizing death within an hour of being consumed			1
yet " takifugu rubripes " ( the official species name ) is still the epitome of gourmet dining in @entity7			1
@entity45 restaurant - goers are prepared to pay 22,000 yen ( $ 210 ) for a near - death experience at high - end restaurants like three @entity102 - starred @entity101 , or the more moderately priced @entity103			0
in recent years , fish breeders have reportedly developed a non-toxic variety by restricting the fugu 's diet , though the poison - filled version is as popular as ever			1
the threat of death is perhaps part of its allure			0
" paintings of fugu have been found in the tombs of ancient @entity64 , " says @entity113 , who runs one of the largest fugu wholesale businesses in @entity6			1
" the @entity64 used the fish to play a primitive version of bowling			1
" @entity113 's fugu history lesson does n't end there			1
" captain cook bought a fugu from the natives of @entity127 and it killed a pig on board ' the resolution , ' " he adds			2
" the most famous human fatality happened in 1975 when @entity132 , a @entity133 actor , died after eating four portions ! " " every dish is a work of science " @entity113 , whose father founded his family 's fish company 40 years ago , explains that fugu is traditionally served in transparent paper - thin strips on painted porcelain plates			1
" master chefs cut them into the shapes of chrysanthemum petals , @entity149 or into animals like peacocks , turtles and butterflies , " he says			0
" every plate is a work of art. every dish is a work of science			0
" we walk around the factory floor , watching his staff wash and process the precious fish			2
" the best is tiger fugu , " says @entity113			2
" it sells at 40,000 yen a kilogram ; one kilogram will feed 30 people			0
we ship them to @entity170			0
it was n't until 1988 that we were allowed to export to the @entity172			0
" but @entity6 is the best place to eat it as you get more when you order in a restaurant			2
maybe 20 pieces compared to eight in @entity177 and @entity45			0
" we stop in front of a man wearing a white coat and a hairnet , expertly filleting a fish with his " hochi " knife			2
" he 's in charge of our fish testicle and genitalia department , " says @entity113 , reverently			2
a day in @entity6 it 's 6:30 a.m. as we drive into @entity6 's city center to hit up the @entity192 fish market ( 5 - 50 @entity193 )			1
stalls are already set up , selling crabs , squid , sea urchins , clams and numerous types of multi-colored seaweed			2
@entity113 leads us to a little curtained - off booth in a corner of the market , one of many eating options here			2
" the @entity208 restaurant here is the best in town , " he says , kissing his fingers and ordering two hot sakes			0
on the breakfast menu : raw slices of fresh tuna sashimi and fugu served with black ponzu sauce , followed by deep - fried tempura fugu , and a fugu " chirinabe " casserole with the local " uiro " rice cakes			1
there 's also a fugu broth with sliced scallions , tofu and grated daikon radishes			2
all delicious , though slightly unnerving			0
deadly dining aside , there 's more to @entity6 and its surrounds than seafood markets			1
a 13 - kilometer ride away from the city center lies the @entity231 castle town of @entity232 , home to @entity234 , with its yellow walled houses and 14th - century lean - tos			0
amid the shrine grounds , @entity113 explains the tenets of @entity7 's @entity240 warrior class			1
" the @entity241 of 1867 began here , " says @entity113			0
" this is the heart of the anti-shogunate movement			0
here , @entity245 raised his army			0
" @entity6 is the birthplace of modern @entity7			1
our country opened up to the @entity250 from here after a foreign flotilla bombarded the town and the disillusioned samurai persuaded the shogunate to accept foreigners			0
" other attractions in and around the city worth checking out include : the @entity259 ; @entity260 , a designated @entity261 ; @entity262 ; the 1,780 - meter - long @entity263 , which connects the island of @entity263 ( part of @entity258 ) with @entity47 ; and @entity266 , a tiny island famed for being the site of an epic duel between sword legends @entity271 and @entity272			0

getting there by air : domestic airlines operate 90 - minute flights from @entity45 's @entity278 to @entity279			0
from there , it 's a one - hour bus ride to @entity282			0
by rail : @entity6 is a 5 hour , 30 minute train ride from @entity45 via @entity285 on the @entity287 - @entity286			2
from @entity177 , it 's two - hour , 40 - minute ride on the @entity291 line .			0

@entity6 , @entity7 's puffer fish capital , is home to a market specializing in the deadly sea creature
trained specialists need to remove the liver , ovaries , roe and kidneys before the fugu can be served
@entity7 fish breeders have developed a *nontoxic* version , though wild fugu remains popular
