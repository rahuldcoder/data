-- it does n't sound like it should be that hard			0
the challenge : design an aircraft that , powered only by a human , can reach 3 meters ( 9.84 feet ) in altitude and hover for at least 60 seconds			1
and yet that dare , first issued in 1980 , stymied the world 's best flight engineers			1
only a handful managed to get their " human helicopter " off the ground			2
none won the elusive $ 250,000 @entity15 , established by the @entity16 for the first team to accomplish the feat. until this year			1
thirty - three years after the @entity15 was established , a @entity20 team led by @entity21 and @entity22 claimed it in june with a 64 - second flight in an indoor athletic arena outside @entity25			1
while @entity22 tracked their progress from the field below , @entity21 powered their delicate aircraft by pedaling a bicycle - like apparatus that twirled four enormous rotors			1
11 @entity34 projects that raised $ 1m or more their achievement was the second flight milestone for @entity21 and @entity22 , who are becoming pioneers in the small but emerging field of human - powered aviation			1
three years ago the pair built perhaps the first flapping - wing aircraft , powered by a human , to sustain flight			1
all of which raises a logical question : why do these things ? what 's the point of designing aircraft that hardly anybody will ever fly ? " there 's not ... practicality to a lot of what we do , " admitted @entity22			2
" you wo n't be flying your human - powered flapping - wing airplane or your human - powered helicopter to work			1
" but all of our projects challenge people 's conventional way of thinking , " he told @entity0 at the recent @entity62 conference in @entity63 , @entity64 , where he and @entity21 were cheered for their innovative approach to problem - solving			1
" we really want people to understand that impossible is nothing , " he added			0
" and just because someone says you ca n't do something , does n't mean you ( ca n't )			0
with the application of passion and persistence and innovative , creative thinking , you can really take on any challenge			0
" photos : the @entity85 take flight modern - day @entity87 @entity89 sketched plans for the first human - powered , flapping - wing aircraft , known as an ornithopter , more than 500 years ago			1
since then , of course , a fixed - wing design has become the standard for airplanes			1
but that has n't stopped aerospace engineers from trying make a variety of ornithopters fly			1
@entity21 and @entity22 , graduates of the @entity103 , launched their ornithopter project in 2006 and began flight testing their aircraft , the @entity107 , three years later			2
the plane had a wingspan of 105 feet -- comparable to that of a @entity111 -- but weighed only 94 pounds			0
a car towed the plane into the air to get it started , while @entity21 sat in a small cockpit and pumped a bar with his feet to operate a system that flapped the wings up and down			0
with every failed test flight -- which broke more than a few planes -- the two engineers learned a little more			2
" basically , with these aircraft , the mantra is , ' you do n't fly any higher than you 're willing to fall			2
' and that tends to keep you fairly safe , " @entity21 said			0
" we 've had some crashes , but no real injuries			0
" unusual energy sources of the future finally , in august 2010 , in a suburban @entity25 field , @entity107 was able to sustain altitude and airspeed for 19.3 seconds while covering a distance of about 475 feet			2
@entity21 , @entity22 and their team believe the brief flight set a world record for an aircraft of its kind			2
then came the human - powered helicopter			1
the team built the aircraft , dubbed @entity147 , in three months , but it took another nine months of crash - filled flight testing before they hit their target			1
" whenever we had a big crash , it was devastating			0
it took so much of our time to piece @entity157 back together again			0
the whole helicopter is built sort of like a house of cards -- if one thing goes , the entire thing falls apart , " @entity22 said			2
" but every time we picked ourselves back up ( after a crash ) , we would know a little bit more than last time			0
" innovative shelter pods help the homeless through winter a land speed record in 2012 , @entity21 and @entity22 established @entity167 , a company dedicated to seeking sustainable enginering and design solutions to technological challenges by using human - powered vehicles as a teaching platform			1
now the two young engineers have their sights on another big goal : setting a land speed record for the fastest human - powered bicycle			1
in september , they went to @entity179 , @entity180 , for the @entity181 , where teams compete on flat desert roads to race aerodynamic bicycles as fast as cars			0
pedaled by @entity21 , their entry @entity188 -- a recumbent bike encased in a sleek carbon - fiber shell -- reached speeds of 77 mph on flat ground			2
" the fact that a human engine -- about the equivalent power of an electric motor the size of your fist -- can power a bicycle at the same speed as that of a car , which has a hundred times or more the power , is really the innovative and inspiring thing that we think people should understand , " @entity22 said			0
malls of the future @entity21 and @entity22 plan to return to @entity179 next year with a faster bike and take aim at the world speed record of 83.8 mph , set this fall by a @entity215 team			0
unlike the ornithopter and the helicopter , a human - powered , high - speed bike might actually have a future as a practical mode of personal transportation			1
but even if it does n't , @entity21 and @entity22 will keep pushing against the boundaries of what humans can achieve			0
the two young @entity20 believe their biggest contribution to flight and speed engineering may be to inspire others to tackle what seems insurmountable			1
" it 's very easy to say something 's impossible , " @entity21 said			0
" it 's much more difficult to change your assumptions , and change your context , to make something possible			0

two young @entity20 aerospace engineers push the boundaries of what 's possible
the pair built a human - powered helicopter that claimed an elusive $ 250,000 prize
they also designed perhaps the first flapping - wing aircraft to sustain flight
the two spoke in *october* at the @entity62 conference in @entity63 , @entity64
