@entity2 and wife @entity4 in a february 2006 photograph			2
@entity2 was last seen in early september , flying a single - engine plane on a pleasure flight from a @entity9 ranch			1
a month - long search for the plane was unsuccessful			2
" as difficult as it is for me to reach this conclusion , i no longer hold out any hope that @entity2 has survived , " wrote @entity12 in court documents filed monday with the @entity14 [ @entity15 ] @entity16			0
she asked that the will of her husband of 38 years be admitted to probate			0
at about 8:45 a.m. on september 3 , the millionaire took off on what he said was to be a solo pleasure flight over the @entity9 mountain range			1

he was carrying a single bottle of water and had no parachute , lawyers for mrs. @entity12 said in the court documents			0
at 3 p.m. , when he had not returned , a search began that ultimately included thousands of volunteers			0
it continued until october 2			0
" no one involved in the search holds out any hope that @entity2 is still alive , " the petition said			2
@entity43 , a sheriff 's supervisor of the @entity45 , said @entity2 's plane was last spotted at 11 a.m. less than 20 miles from the ranch 's airport			1
" given the timeline and the sighting of @entity2 's plane , i believe he was within 20 to 25 miles of the ranch when he crashed , " @entity43 said			1
but , he noted , " the terrain is very difficult to search , with many areas where the crevices , deep ravines and closely grown trees make it impossible to see from the air what is on the ground			0
" " if @entity2 was physically able to find water to survive on in the @entity9 desert , he would have been physically capable of signaling searchers , by doing something as simple as crafting a large x of sticks or rocks , or by starting a signal fire , " @entity43 said			1
in affidavits supporting his wife 's petition , @entity2 's doctor described the 63 - year - old man as physically and mentally fit			2
@entity75 , a captain in the @entity77 @entity76 who was involved in the search , noted that the difficulty in finding wreckage was underscored by the fact that @entity83 - era plane wreckage was discovered last spring in the mountain range			0
