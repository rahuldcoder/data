simple , right ? the first thing anyone does in this world is take a breath of air -- it should be effortless			2
for me , and nearly 70,000 people across the world like me , it 's not so easy			1
i have cystic fibrosis ( @entity12 ) and i have never been able to take a full breath of air			1
every day for 23 years , it has been a struggle to breathe			1
i often get asked what @entity12 is , or what it is like to live with @entity12 there is no one true answer			1
the best i can come up with is , imagine living every single day with something like bronchitis , or , a little more simply put , imagine having to breathe through a straw all day , every day			1
the mucus that fills my lungs and traps some of the most deadly bacteria imaginable as a result of my genetic defect has always been inside me			1
so , how do i live with it ? i never feel bad for myself			2
when it comes to living with a chronic illness , self - pity , in my opinion , is the root cause of failure			2
i was dealt a certain hand of cards at birth and i am making the very best of it			1
it 's not anyone 's fault i have @entity12 it is n't a curse			1
it is n't bad luck			2
i have every reason in the world to stay in bed all day and feel sorry for myself , but i do n't			2
i get up and carry out my day like most people			1
i graduated college in four years , have a job and take care of all of my responsibilities			2
i do n't hold anything back			2
between all the inhaled treatments , mucus clearing therapies and the 80 pills or so that i ingest every day , the amount of time i spend taking care of myself is the equivalent of a full time job ... and that 's only when i am healthy			1
the physical treatments themselves may only take about two to three hours total , but every single decision i make throughout the day has some impact on my health , one way or another			2
am i going out with my friends on a friday night ? is it ok to skip a treatment because i am too tired ? can i go away for the weekend , or am i starting to feel sick ? questions like these constantly go through my head			0
as far as i am concerned , this is all just a part of my life			0
i do n't know any other way			0
when it comes down to it , i do n't have any complaints ; i think i live a great life			0
i have the best friends i could ever ask for			0
i have an amazing sister			0
i had the best four years of my life at @entity86			0
i am able to work a few jobs and i was an athlete growing up			0
( i might still consider myself an athlete , but the jury is still out on that decision ! ) there is a difference between being alive , and truly living			0
in 70 years , when i am 93 years old , i want to be able to look back on my life and know that i have an enormous collection of unforgettable experiences			0
i think the experiences and memories we create for ourselves are what define our personalities			0
i want people to say , " wow			1
that guy @entity101 has lived a great life			1
" i realize i am still pretty young , but i like to think that i have a pretty good understanding about the value of life and how fragile it can be			0
i could be having the greatest day of my life one day , but the next i could be hunched over coughing up blood			0
it is just the reality of the disease i live with			2
every day , good or bad , has shaped who i am			0
the bottom line , though , is that cystic fibrosis has taught me how to be resilient			1
i do n't take no for an answer and i know i can be whatever i want to be			0
i was sort of born into a unique situation			0
because my dad 's a national figure and my parents ' were willing to take on @entity12 in a public way , i have been given the chance to make a difference			1
some may call me the poster boy for cystic fibrosis , but i do n't think anyone should have that title			1
we 're all in this together			0
every family that has to carry the @entity12 burden is in this fight			1
all i want to do is give @entity12 patients a voice , so that one day we are n't dealing with the pain that comes along with the disease			1
one day , it will be behind us			0

an estimated 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis
disease causes mucus to clog the lungs , making it very *difficult* to breathe
@entity101 was *diagnosed* with @entity12 when he was 2
now 23 , he says the disease has taught him to be resilient
