@entity0 , @entity1 -- pope @entity3 arrived in @entity0 on tuesday amid speculation over whether he will meet with the island 's former president , @entity5 , and how far he 'll press the country for greater political and religious freedoms			1
@entity3 visited both privately and publicly with president @entity9 on tuesday evening			1
those meetings , at least one of which was expected to include @entity5 's family , prompted talk as to whether that also would include the president 's older brother , who stepped down from power in 2006 after battling illness			0
the closely - watched trip is the second part of a two - country tour @entity3 has used to spread the catholic faith and address political issues -- at times subtly and on occasions more overtly			2
he had traveled to @entity28 prior to heading to @entity1 , and drew added attention when he said he prayed " for those deprived of freedom			2
" last week , the pontiff said that @entity1 's @entity35 political system " no longer corresponds to reality			2
" a top @entity37 government official responded to the pope 's comments , saying his country 's system is sustainable and that it will not change			0
" in @entity1 , there will not be political reform , " said @entity42 , vice president of the island 's council of ministers			1
also arriving on the island over the weekend was @entity49 president @entity48 , reported by @entity37 state television to be in @entity1 for radiation treatment for cancer			1
it 's also not clear whether @entity3 will visit with @entity48 , who has frequently traveled to @entity1 for medical care and to meet with the country 's leaders , but the island was abuzz tuesday with talk over what kind of behind - the - scenes discussions among the leaders , if any , were being had			1
on wednesday , @entity3 is scheduled to preside over huge crowds during @entity63 in the capital 's @entity64 , where 14 years ago @entity66 addressed throngs of @entity37 in the historic first papal visit to the island			1
@entity0 officials have been busy planning for his arrival , painting buildings and tacking posters across the city			1
the trip is timed to the 400th anniversary of @entity78 , @entity1 's patron saint , but uncertainty looms over what more will be said , with whom the pope will meet and what the visit will actually mean for @entity37			1
" for me , i 'm very happy he 's coming , " said @entity85 , a shopkeeper in the capital 's @entity0 district			2
" i was here when @entity89 came , and there were always plenty of tourists that followed			0
" the visit is also seen as a possible tourism boost to the island 's cash - strapped economy , as many residents seek to make use of a series of free market reforms that have slowly swelled the number of private businesses in the country			2
small privately owned shops have since cropped up along side streets in the @entity37 capital , and property , including real estate , can be bought and sold for the first time in decades			0
@entity3 , 84 , arrived in @entity1 's southeastern city of @entity1 on monday , later heading to the city 's @entity111 where he prayed in front of the @entity78 , a wooden statue considered to be the shrine of the island 's patron saint			1
upon his arrival , the pontiff was greeted by @entity9 and the country 's clergy , including @entity37 cardinal @entity122			2
with a red carpet rolled out to meet @entity3 's airplane , @entity5 walked beside the pontiff on monday to a pair of large wooden chairs where the two stood for a brief photo op. a brass band played @entity1 's national anthem and other tunes as they stood together , while artillery rounds were fired nearby in celebration			1
@entity3 told the audience he seeks to emphasize " the importance of faith , " highlighting the need for good relations between the church and the @entity35 state			1
" i carry in my heart the just aspirations and legitimate desires of all @entity37 , wherever they may be , " he said			0
@entity5 welcomed @entity3 , saying his country has worked for peace and justice , but also took the opportunity to deliver a swipe at the @entity150			0
even " 14 years after @entity89 's visit , " the @entity150 economic embargo against @entity1 persists , @entity5 said			1
clad all in white , @entity3 walked with the @entity37 president , who was dressed in a dark suit , and greeted other state officials and clergy			1
crowds of flag - waving @entity37 lined the street on which @entity3 's motorcade traveled , as @entity37 state television captured both ground and aerial footage of the trip			1
@entity3 then celebrated @entity63 in the city 's square , drawing huge crowds , as legions of musicians playing wind and string instruments performed during pauses in his sermon , supported by what appeared to be concert - grade sound systems			0
@entity1 says it wo n't change its political system in 1998 , @entity5 greeted a much different pontiff when thousands were introduced to @entity66 , who famously urged the nation " to open to the world , and the world to open to @entity1			0
" " there was a kind of love affair between @entity89 and @entity188 , " said @entity2 senior @entity183 analyst @entity182			0
" it just is n't the same with @entity3			0
" in @entity28 , an archbishop urged worshipers to stop making comparisons between @entity3 and his predecessor , who drew massive crowds across @entity188 and visited every country in the region before he died in 2005			0
in @entity1 , though @entity89 helped to warm church - government relations , the country 's ties with religion have remained complicated			2
decades earlier , @entity5 's communist revolution sought to stamp out religious influence in @entity1 , confiscating church property and expelling religious workers , some of whom had supported anti-castro forces			2
the country was officially atheist until the 1990s when the constitution was amended , and references to atheism were replaced with secularism			0
@entity213 was recognized as a holiday at that time , and @entity216 members were permitted to openly practice their faith , if they had one			1
church officials now say the island is about 60 % @entity221 , though few openly practice			1
still , religious access to state television and the administration of religious schools remain largely restricted , which could be a point of emphasis during the pontiff 's trip , observers said			0
" these papal visits can have an impact , " @entity182 said			0
" they can kind of jar things loose			0
and it seems that under @entity9 , @entity1 is taking baby steps toward normalization			1
" but many on the island seem skeptical that the trip will yield lasting results			0
while the country 's @entity242 has often been lauded for its role in recent reforms , it has also received heavy criticism for appearing too cozy with the government			0
rights groups say the nation has largely emptied its jails of political prisoners , and yet it continues to harass the country 's activists .			0
