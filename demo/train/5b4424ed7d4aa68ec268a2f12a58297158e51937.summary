@entity0 -- president @entity2 blasted his @entity4 counterpart friday for what he called offensive and hateful remarks about the september 11 attacks			1
@entity4 president @entity8 blamed the @entity9 for the 2001 terrorist attacks , an accusation that triggered a walkout thursday by several @entity14 delegates			1
" well , it was offensive			0
it was hateful , " @entity2 said in part of an interview with @entity18 released by the @entity19			0
" and particularly for him to make the statement here in @entity24 , just a little north of ground zero , where families lost their loved ones -- people of all faiths , all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation -- for him to make a statement like that was inexcusable , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 said @entity8 's comments stand in contrast to the sympathy expressed by the @entity4 people in the aftermath of the attacks			1
" and it just shows once again sort of the difference between how the @entity4 leadership and this regime operates and how i think the vast majority of the @entity4 people , who are respectful and thoughtful , think about these issues , " @entity2 said			2
@entity52 deputy prime minister @entity51 said at the @entity14 on friday that @entity8 's " bizarre " remarks were meant to distract attention from @entity4 issues that generate media headlines			1
@entity8 delivered a fiery speech before the @entity58 on thursday , criticizing @entity59 , capitalism and the world body itself			2
though incendiary statements from @entity8 are nothing new , tension in the hall grew as the @entity4 leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the september 11 attacks			1
" some segments within the @entity9 government orchestrated the attack , " @entity8 told the @entity58			2
he followed with the claim that the attacks were aimed at reversing " the declining @entity9 economy and its scripts on the @entity76 in order to save the @entity79 regime			0
the majority of the @entity9 people , as well as most nations and politicians around the world , agree with this view			0
" that appeared to be the last straw for many of the diplomats			0
representatives from the @entity9 , @entity52 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 walked out while @entity8 asserted that the @entity9 government was involved in the attacks or allowed them to happen as an excuse to go to war in @entity99 and @entity100			1
@entity2 , who had delivered his address to the @entity58 earlier , had already left the grounds before @entity8 spoke			2
@entity103 , a spokesman for the @entity9 mission to the @entity14 , issued a statement saying , " rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the @entity4 people , mr. @entity8 has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable			1
" the head of the @entity113 said his organization 's work is made even more important by @entity8 's statements			1
" while the impulse may be to ignore the rant of an individual who has consistently demonstrated a refusal to accept basic historic facts , including the murder of millions during the @entity124 , we can not , " said @entity117			0
" because someone like @entity8 espouses and expresses such lies publicly , we at the @entity113 and @entity126 must lead the preservation and presentation of the authentic history of what occurred on 9/11 , " he said			0
" this history not only includes the worst of humanity in the execution of the heinous terrorist attacks , but also the best of who we can be through how this country and much of the world came together to support those in need			0
" @entity8 went on to compare the death toll in the september 11 attacks to the casualty count in the wars in @entity99 in @entity100			1
" it was said that some 3,000 people were killed on september 11th , for which we are all very saddened , " he said			0
" yet , up until now in @entity99 and @entity100 , hundreds of thousands of people have been killed , millions wounded and displaced , and the conflict is still going on and expanding			0
" @entity8 's speech was hailed as a gift from @entity157 at @entity159 's weekly friday prayers , @entity4 's semi-official @entity154 reported			1
" we do not consider the remarks as those only belonging to the president himself , rather as a divine gift to the [ @entity4 ] nation , " said @entity160 , who led the prayer session friday .			2

@entity8 's @entity14 speech hailed as " divine gift " in @entity4
