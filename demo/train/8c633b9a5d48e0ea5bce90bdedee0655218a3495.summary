-- when district attorney @entity2 last tweeted about a shooting in @entity4 , it was about a man found guilty of a killing at a liquor store			1
@entity2 touted the success of her office in convicting @entity10 for shooting to death @entity11			1
few outside @entity13 probably knew @entity2 ' name then -- her @entity16 account only has 62 followers			1
but that was a month before the cinema killings			2
before @entity20 , the man with orange hair who called himself " @entity22 , " was arrested for spraying a movie theater audience with gunfire during an early morning screening of the new @entity27 movie			1
he stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding 38 others			2
official : package at university mail room apparently sent by @entity13 suspect now @entity2 finds herself handling @entity37 's next big case , all eyes upon her to deliver justice			1
she appeared in a dark pantsuit before a horde of reporters and clicking cameras on monday , the day @entity20 first appeared in court			1
some who know her believe this case presents the moment she has long awaited			2
she 's a veteran prosecutor who has rarely drawn attention beyond the local limelight			2
this could be her last hurrah as head of the 18th @entity52 -- term limits on her office force her to step down later this year			2
she 's known for being tough			2
she 's known even more for not caring how she or her actions are reflected in public			0
she told the @entity57 once that she was " not motivated by people to like me			0
" @entity59 , a defense lawyer in @entity60 who has known @entity2 for years , said she is someone who believes strongly in what she is doing and does n't care if she garners negative publicity			1
" that is to be respected , " he said			0
but it has also made her a controversial figure in the world of @entity13 courts			0
@entity68 , a journalist for @entity60 's @entity70 newspaper who has covered @entity2 since she took office in 2004 , called her a maverick who is well acquainted with controversy			1
threats before , after other ' @entity78 ' showings , authorities said @entity68 has doggedly written about how @entity2 has turned her office into a " conviction machine			1
" from seeking the death penalty in a state that does not embrace it to pursuing harsh habitual - criminal charges against chronic but low - level offenders , she has earned a reputation as a hard - ass			1
" as far as prosecution is concerned , you probably could n't be in a better jurisdiction , " said @entity90 , who worked in @entity2 ' office before she was elected district attorney and later , as a defense attorney , butted legal heads with her in court			1
a 2008 @entity70 article was headlined " @entity100 : censured but defiant , @entity2 goes after habitual criminals -- and cops , judges and lawyers -- like no other district attorney			1
but at what cost ? " the cost was that these low - level offenders were being put away on absurdly long and costly sentences when the prison system was overloaded and rehab programs were grossly underfunded , wrote @entity68 , citing @entity13 defense attorneys			0
residents return to building where suspect set boobytraps @entity2 , said @entity90 , goes after the most minor offenders with gusto			1
" there 's no deference given to any defendant whatsoever , " he said			0
@entity2 is the only state district attorney in @entity13 to seek the death penalty in the past five years			1
two of the three men on @entity13 's death row were prosecuted by @entity2			1
that makes her an anomaly in a state that fell one vote short in 2009 of abolishing capital punishment			2
" that jurisdiction is very enamored with the death penalty , " @entity59 said about @entity130			1
" and this is a state that uses it very sparingly			2
" many of the @entity4 cinema shooting victims ' family and friends are demanding death for the suspect			2
in this case , they will have a prosecutor who is not shy about seeking the harshest punishment			0
" if there ever was a case for the death penalty , this is probably that case , " @entity59 said			1
" what 's a more extreme case than this ? " @entity13 shooting : stories of survival @entity2 told reporters this week that her office had a lot of work to do in the investigation			1
" i would say there 's no such thing as a slam - dunk case , " she said			0
" we 're still looking at the enormous amount of evidence			0
" she will get to decide whether @entity20 ' case will be a capital one			1
but by the time the trial progresses , which @entity59 said could take years , @entity2 will be long gone			1
" @entity2 is a very successful prosecutor , " said a profile of her this week in the @entity173 magazine			1
" she has the experience , talent and intellect necessary to prosecute the coming @entity20 case in a productive way			1
but she does n't necessarily come to her most famous case , her legacy case , with completely clean hands			0
" she is tainted perhaps by allegations of questionable ethics -- including providing benefits to prosecution witnesses and a tight management style that has led to a backlog of cases , @entity59 said			0
she was even publicly censured recently , @entity68 said			0
and , she has been known to scuffle with judges , police officers and other public officials			0
a @entity2 spokeswoman said she would not comment because of a gag order placed on the @entity20 case , but she has always denied the allegations against her and stood firmly in her convictions			1
even some of her detractors call @entity2 a fair person who tries to do the right thing			1
@entity59 called her when he was defending @entity200 , the @entity13 governor 's former campaign manager who was accused of mishandling funds			0
he recalled her saying : i know what it 's like to be a victim of a political witch hunt			0
@entity59 said @entity2 was fair			1
she is a @entity210 who was dealing with a @entity213 scandal			0
but after looking into it , @entity2 cleared @entity200 of wrongdoing			1
@entity59 said he believes @entity2 ' past comes into play in her role as a prosecutor			1
court appearance fuels theories about @entity13 shooting suspect she was raised in a small town in @entity223 , the daughter of a @entity226 pastor , according to her official biography			0
her grandfather worked for the church as did her three uncles			0
" so needless to say , my childhood centered around the church , which was our extended family , " she wrote in her biography			0
she earned a nursing degree from @entity237 and then moved to @entity60 , where she worked in the emergency room to put herself through law school at the @entity240			0
" during the two years i worked in the @entity241 at @entity242 , i saw the results of homelessness , poverty , drug abuse , sudden and unexpected death , @entity249 's , suicide , disabilities , mental illness , chronic disease , severe alcohol addiction , victimization , violent crime , sexual assault , child abuse , elder abuse and driving under the influence , " she wrote			2
how to help the victims @entity59 believes @entity2 ' nursing experience makes her extremely empathetic and solicitous of crime victims			2
" as all @entity263 should be , " he said			0
" but she comes at it from a different background			0
" @entity2 worked in medical malpractice defense but wanted to be a prosecutor in criminal cases			2
she joined the 18th @entity52 , which covers four @entity13 counties			0
@entity59 said he understands why @entity2 has a blemished reputation			1
but she 's not necessarily as inflexible as people make her out to be			0
" if you ask her constituents , she 's done an effective job as a law enforcement officer , " he said			0
she married @entity276 , who defended the most notorious criminal perhaps in contemporary @entity37 -- @entity278			0
he was even there to witness the execution of the @entity282 bomber			0
in @entity59 's mind , that makes @entity2 not a zealot , after all			2
now all of @entity37 will be able to see her , judge her , as @entity287 have done for years -- as she prosecutes a man suspected in another heinous act that will also be a part of modern @entity37 history			2
warning signs of violence : what to do @entity0 's @entity295 and @entity296 contributed to this report .			0

district attorney @entity2 has a reputation of being tough
she has also courted controversy over the years
