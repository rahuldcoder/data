-- @entity2 's hopes of retaining the @entity4 title suffered a setback on wednesday as the @entity7 champions slumped to a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity9			1
superb strikes from @entity11 and @entity12 plus a late @entity14 own goal earned the home side a deserved victory and condemned @entity2 to a second successive loss following saturday 's shock 3 - 2 home defeat by bottom club @entity20			1
the result , @entity2 's first away reverse this season , left @entity24 's second - placed team three points behind rivals @entity26 , with @entity27 in third another three points behind with a game in hand			1
early season pace - setters @entity9 came into the match on the back of a poor recent run of just one win in eight matches , a sequence which had seen @entity39 's side slump to seventh in the table			0
who are the top january transfer targets ? but they were always the dominant side against a disjointed @entity2 , and it was no surprise when the hosts took a 33rd - minute lead when top scorer @entity11 superbly swiveled on the edge of the area before smashing home his 15th goal of the season			2
@entity9 doubled the lead early in the second half with another spectacular goal , as @entity12 curled home a delightful long - range free - kick that hit the underside of the crossbar before bouncing over the goal - line of keeper @entity60 -- who was recalled in place of @entity62			2
@entity2 's miserable night was complete in the final minute when a long ball from @entity9 goalkeeper @entity64 was turned into his own net by @entity66 defender @entity14			1
@entity9 remained in seventh place , though now just a point behind @entity69			0
in wednesday 's other @entity4 match , @entity70 moved off the bottom after recovering from a goal behind to win 2 - 1 at @entity74			1
the home side took a 63rd - minute lead in freak circumstances when @entity74 goalkeeper @entity79 's long clearance flew over his opposite number @entity81 and into the net			0
however , former @entity69 striker @entity83 leveled for the visitors just four minutes later before captain @entity85 -- who has been linked with a move to @entity87 during the transfer window -- smashed home the winner with 12 minutes remaining			0
in @entity92 , @entity91 put one foot into the quarterfinals of the @entity94 with a 4 - 0 victory at home to @entity97 in the first leg of their last - 16 tie			0
@entity101 netted twice in the first half and @entity103 came off the substitutes ' bench to add another couple after the break to give @entity109 's side a healthy advantage ahead of next week 's return match .			0

@entity4 champions @entity2 are *thrashed* 3 - 0 at @entity9
@entity11 , @entity12 and a @entity14 own goal gives @entity9 win
the defeat is @entity2 's second in a *row* after their 3 - 2 defeat at @entity20
@entity70 off the bottom of the @entity4 after a 2 - 1 victory at @entity74
