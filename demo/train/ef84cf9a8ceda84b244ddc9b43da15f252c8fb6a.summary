-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 is considering legislation that would declare a public safety emergency in some @entity2 counties where residents often have been left to try to fend for themselves			1
the measure would also impose a temporary income tax on residents of counties unable to pay for public safety workers due to budget cuts			1
" the state has an interest in maintaining a network of public safety throughout @entity2 , " said @entity13 , a spokesperson for the governor , in an e-mail statement to @entity0			1
@entity20 , where there is one sheriff and three deputies to serve 80,000 people , would be one of those affected			1
the shortage of officers and the department 's limited hours led to an incident in august that helped prompt state legislators to take action , @entity0 affiliate @entity27 reported			2
a woman was assaulted by her ex-boyfriend after she called 911 and tried to get an officer at her home			1
her call was transferred to the state police because the sheriff 's department is n't staffed 24 hours a day or seven days a week , the station said			2
a dispatcher for the state police said , " uh , i do n't have anybody to send out there			2
you know , obviously , if he comes inside the residence and assaults you , can you ask him to go away ? " the man was arrested later that day , was later convicted and is imprisoned , @entity27 reported			2
her distress call is not the only that has come in with officials unable to help , the station said			2
on tuesday , residents of @entity20 , shot down a measure to increase property taxes to increase funding for their depleted sheriff department , court security , animal control and juvenile justice			1
the tax levy , voted down by 539 votes , would have provided a $ 9.6 million yearly fund over three years			2
" it would have allowed us a calm breathing room to arrive a better funding source , " county commissioner @entity68 told @entity0			1
the average increase per homeowner would have been about $ 200 a year , explained @entity68			0
" we have had a history of people being very protective of having the lowest property tax in the state of @entity2			0
there has to be a groundswell of people that will be able to move those folks into a minority , " said @entity68 , who expressed frustration at the fact that 49 % of registered voters in the county did not vote			1
but as @entity68 explained , there is a very popular sentiment in the community of taking the law into your own hands			0
" and that is all fine and dandy until you have to shoot somebody			0
but you better make sure you have shot him in accordance with the law because in an effort to save yourself $ 200 a year , you could lose everything you have			0
this is a real myopic view that permeates many folks in the community			0
they see only their situation instead of the community structure			0
they think , ' i will prospect only my land , ' " @entity68 said			0
commissioner @entity110 told @entity27 that @entity2 does n't need to step in			1
" i 'm never for authority being usurped by the state , " he said			0
" i think we are best in a position to reflect the will of the people here and i always advocate for local control			0
" @entity20 's budget was dependent on a federal subsidy program , which dispersed money to offset shrinking timber receipts to 33 counties in the state , he said			1
it dried up last year , and the county has not received any funding this year			0
the federal government owns 70 % of the land ( which can not be taxed by local governments ) in the mostly forested county , where the last mill recently closed			1
but even if @entity1 and @entity2 lawmakers pass the public safety emergency bill , local legislative leaders and the county 's governing body would have to consent to it			1
that is a conversation , @entity68 said , that has n't happened yet			0
@entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			0

woman was assaulted after calling 911 and being told no officer was available
@entity146 may vote to impose taxes on counties that lack certain public safety workers
many residents of @entity20 are set on defending themselves , commissioner says
*logging* - dependent counties lost money from federal government program they used for public safety
