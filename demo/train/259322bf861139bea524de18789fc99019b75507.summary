-- rapid economic growth , rich stores of natural resources and a fast - growing population have all helped usher in a new era of optimism around @entity8 's future			1
but is there a missing link that 's preventing the continent 's economies from boosting their business potential and achieving their development goals ? " yes , " claims the @entity16 , pointing out the continent 's " acute shortage " of high - quality , well - trained local managers			1
the @entity22 - based group wants to tackle the continent 's talent gap by creating one million skilled @entity26 managers over the next 10 years			1
" the demand is there , " says @entity27 , director of the non-profit organization			0
" we meet business owner after business owner across the continent who tell us that , if they are growing , then getting good managers is the biggest challenge right now			0
" read this : hotels , the latest @entity26 gold rush @entity41 describes poor management in @entity8 as one of the biggest " bottlenecks for growth " across a range of organizations -- from large companies and multinationals to governments and @entity51			0
but more importantly , she says , it 's holding back the " engine of job creation " in most countries : small and medium - size businesses			2
" we read headlines every day about ' @entity60 , ' we are seeing @entity26 economies take off and we are just finding on the ground that these small and medium - size companies are unable to grow , create more jobs and expand their businesses because of that lack of middle - management capacity			2
" aiming high for sure , creating one million well - trained , locally grown managers by 2023 to spearhead @entity8 's business development is an overly ambitious proposition in a continent where top business schools are few and far between -- there are about 90 institutions offering an mba in @entity8 , according to an @entity16 report , whereas @entity77 has more than 1,500			1
the @entity16 , which says it has a network of more than 5,000 @entity26 managers and entrepreneurs , estimates that there are about 10 million people in managerial and supervisory positions across the continent			1
" if we can reach one in 10 of the 10 million managers out there indirectly , if we can have one in 10 @entity26 managers operating really effectively , then the continent will be a different place , " says @entity41			2
educating future managers to achieve its target , the @entity16 , which gets most of its funding from the @entity96 , in @entity97 , has started launching a series of initiatives designed to expand access to key education tools , including a virtual campus tailored specifically for @entity26 managers and entrepreneurs			0
" what we want to do is leapfrog the traditional bricks - and - mortar approach to business schools and business training , " says @entity41			0
" we want to leverage technology to deliver high - quality practical relevant management education at a price that people can afford , combining online content with offline peer support			0
" read this : @entity8 's new skyscraper cities on june 17 , the @entity16 began its pilot of a two - week course where participants access free web - based practical tutorials in the form of video , audio or text to sharpen their management skills			1
the " launchpad : @entity132 in @entity8 " module , which will have low bandwidth requirements and be available on mobile , will cover topics such as effective communication , goal setting and time management			0
@entity41 says it is part of the @entity16 's efforts to eventually develop @entity8 's first full - blown @entity139 ( @entity139 ) , in conjunction with three of @entity8 's leading business schools -- @entity143 's @entity142 , @entity145 's @entity144 and @entity147 's @entity146 " the idea is to partner with the business schools in the continent and get the business teachers to deliver their content online and then to support that with offline learning , " says @entity41			1
" so the model is the learning is free but if you want a certificate you pay a small fee			0
" the @entity16 says about 600 people have signed up for the pilot @entity139 .			2
