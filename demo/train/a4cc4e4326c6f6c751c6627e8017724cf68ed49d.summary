@entity2 , @entity3 @entity0 was a 19 - year - old in her final year of high school , with dreams of becoming a doctor			0
then , @entity7 came to her village last august , and her world collapsed			1
she described to me in chilling detail , how the jihadis first demanded that members of her @entity15 religious minority convert to @entity16			1
then they stripped villagers of their jewelry , money and cellphones			0
they separated the men from the women			2
a @entity27 report explained what happened next			0
@entity7 " gathered all the males older than 10 years of age at the local school , took them outside the village by pick - up trucks , and shot them			1
" among those believed dead were @entity0 's father and eldest brother			0
a different fate lay in store for the women			2
@entity0 described how girls like herself were separated from older women , then bussed to the city of @entity43			2
there they were put in a big three - story house with hundreds of other young women			1
the men of @entity7 came periodically , and chose up to three and four girls at a time to take home with them			2
" these women have been treated like cattle , " explained @entity50 , an adviser to the @entity51 on gender issues			1
" they have been subjected to physical and sexual violence , including systematic rape and sex slavery			0
they 've been exposed in markets in @entity43 and in @entity60 , @entity61 , carrying price tags			0
" perhaps more importantly , @entity50 is also a researcher at the @entity63 - based @entity65 's @entity64			0
according to the field research and testimonials of @entity50 's team , @entity7 kidnapped more than 2,500 @entity15 women			1
meanwhile @entity70 , a @entity15 activist based in @entity3 @entity71 has compiled the names of at least 4,601 @entity15 women currently missing			1
in the first month after the mass abductions , @entity70 says she was receiving calls and messages from up to 70 different hostages a day			0
now , she ca n't reach a single hostage			0
after more than a decade reporting on conflict in the @entity82 , i was still ill - prepared to hear about the scale of this kidnapping and modern day enslavement			2
suddenly , the words of a 19 - year - old @entity7 imprisoned fighter whom i interviewed last weekend in a @entity71 prison in northern @entity61 made sense			1
the young man , horribly disfigured from bullet wounds to his abdomen and arm received during his year of fighting on the frontlines , described how @entity7 attracted fresh recruits with the offer of cash and " wives			1
" @entity7 actually justified its enslavement of @entity15 in its own online magazine			1
" one should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -- the infidels -- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the @entity110 , or @entity16 law , " the group announced in the @entity7 publication " @entity103			1
" the @entity71 authorities say they have rescued around 100 @entity15 women , in part through the payment of ransoms to @entity118 tribesmen who acted as intermediaries			1
thousands of women remain hostage			0
and with @entity7 successfully defending its territory from a loose coalition of @entity3 military , @entity3 @entity71 peshmerga , @entity61 @entity71 militants and @entity129 - led airstrikes , it does n't look like a white knight will charge in to rescue these poor women any time soon			1
@entity50 said all of the 100 @entity15 women rescued from @entity7 appeared to have been systematically raped , likely by more than one man			1
the 19 - year - old girl i spoke with here in @entity3 @entity71 was deeply traumatized , and incapable of showing any joy or humor			2
her mother and two brothers are still being held hostage by @entity7			2
asked what she would say if she met the 70 - year - old @entity118 man who took her home and ordered her to convert to @entity16 at gunpoint , she says : " i would n't want to tell him anything			0
i just want to kill him			0
" @entity0 says she has given up her dream of becoming a doctor			0
@entity1 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
