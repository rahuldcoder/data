-- after the highs of 2013 , it has n't been a great year for @entity3			1
however , the @entity5 tennis star says she is " on the right track " after getting back to winning ways at @entity7 on sunday			1
she won the @entity10 tournament for the third time , fighting back from a horror start to defeat @entity14 world no. 7 @entity15 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 6 - 3 in the final in @entity17			1
it not only gave @entity3 a @entity20 - leading fourth title this season , but helped her become just the fifth player to be ranked no. 1 for 200 weeks or more since the women 's standings began in 1975			1
having failed to make it past the first week at @entity28 and the @entity29 , and losing in the last 16 at the season 's opening grand slam in @entity32 , the 32 - year - old is now seeking to resurrect her season by retaining her @entity35 title next month			2
" it would definitely make it better , but it would n't make it go away , " she said when asked if success in @entity37 would make up for her disappointing year so far			0
" i feel like i 'm on the right track again			0
i feel like i can play even better -- i was n't serving my best , and i was n't making as many winners off the return as i wanted to , but i think i 'm getting there			0
" @entity7 was her first tournament since a bizarre performance during a doubles match at @entity28 , which she later explained as being due to a viral illness			0
@entity3 , who started her sixth spell at no. 1 in february 2013 , trailed 5 - 1 in the opening set against @entity15 , who she had beaten in all but one of their previous five meetings			1
" i was just thinking i had to take it one point at a time , " @entity3 said			2
" i knew i just had to relax and not be so crazy			0
" up until that point i was n't doing what i wanted to do , and what i had been doing in practice , so i knew i just had to start doing the right things going forward			0
" @entity3 now has 61 career titles , 39 behind third - ranked @entity61 on the all - time list			1
however , she is only five grand slams behind the @entity14 's record of 22 and @entity61 said she would n't bet against @entity65 closing on that milestone			2
" while i do n't have a crystal ball , living in @entity71 i 've come to appreciate odds , " the 45 - year - old told the @entity20 website when asked about @entity3 ' chances of extending her tally			2
" my answer would be yes			0
" @entity61 holds the record of 377 weeks at no. 1 -- more than any player , male or female -- and paid tribute to @entity3 ' achievement in passing the 200 mark			1
" being at your best all the time in a year - round sport is all - consuming , " @entity61 said			0
" add to it being the best as you set the bar makes it more exhausting -- physically , mentally and emotionally			0
" keeping that up for almost four years is remarkable			0
" the tour now heads to @entity89 for the @entity90 in @entity91 , where defending champion @entity3 faces a potential quarterfinal against rising star @entity93			1
@entity15 is in the same quarter of the draw as @entity95 , who she beat at @entity28 , while the strong field also includes that tournament 's champion @entity98 and former no. 1 @entity100 .			1

@entity3 wins her 61st career title in @entity17 on sunday
@entity5 *triumphs* at @entity10 for third time
she is fifth women 's player to be ranked no. 1 for 200 weeks or more
