@entity0 , @entity1 -- he 's baaaaack			2
the defiant and combative @entity4 that reporters knew from the past returned in full spring bloom on friday , now that a report he commissioned cleared him of wrongdoing in the @entity11 lane closure controversy			1
a few minutes into his first news conference in more than two months , @entity1 's @entity13 governor flashed his famous cantankerousness at suggestions he was hiding something about the apparently politically motivated traffic jams last september in @entity19			1
" colorful , " he interjected as one journalist asked an extended question			0
" can you get to it already ? " later , he cut off a reporter to complain she was wrong about the timing of events in december			0
" stop , " he said , insisting that " you have to get the facts right if you 're going to ask the question			0
" when the journalist persisted , @entity4 cut in with " excuse me , excuse me " and then moved on by saying " the premise of the question is so infirm i 'm not going to answer it			2
" @entity4 's feisty approach had been missing of late , especially during his previous news conference in january that lasted almost two hours as the governor faced questions about the scandal labeled @entity37 by @entity39 foes			1
separate federal and state investigations continue , but the report released this week found no evidence that @entity4 was involved in possible political retribution against @entity19 's @entity39 mayor for not endorsing his re-election			1
@entity4 holds first news conference in two months @entity4 called the report exhaustive while critics labeled it a whitewash			1
regardless of perspective , it gave @entity4 renewed vigor to face public questioning on the issue during friday 's news conference that lasted just over an hour			1
the return of his trademark gruffness provides multiple benefits for @entity4 , who easily won re-election last year in traditionally @entity39 @entity1 and now has possible ambitions for the @entity13 presidential nomination in 2016			1
he tightly managed friday 's news conference , basically telling journalists that he did n't care if they liked his answers or not			1
more importantly , his tough tactics play well among media - hating conservatives he will need to win the @entity13 nomination two years from now , if he runs			0
some on the political right mistrust @entity4 because of moderate positions on issues such as gay marriage , as well as his public support for president @entity78 as they toured the damage from @entity81 days before @entity78 's reelection in 2012			2
" now that he 's been self - exonerated , it appears that he 's decided to dispense with his faux humility of the past few months , " @entity84 spokesman @entity83 said of the governor			0
one particularly heated exchange involved @entity90 , his former deputy chief of staff whose now - infamous email " time for some traffic problems in @entity19 " propelled what was a little noticed local controversy into an outright political crisis for the governor			1
@entity4 said he canned @entity90 for lying to him , and he decided against meeting with her before the firing to avoid any perception of coercion or intimidation on the matter			0
when a reporter persisted on the topic , @entity4 exploded at the premise of the question			0
" i do n't know whether you ca n't take notes or you 're not listening , but for you to characterize my last answer that i did n't want to ask her because i did n't want to know is so awful that it is beneath the job you hold , " he said			0
@entity4 saved his best for last , concluding the more than hour - long session by sarcastically telling reporters " it 's such a joy and relief to be finally able to come back and interact with you in the kind and gentle way we always have			2
" " i 'd love to say i missed you , " he added , " but i did n't			0
" @entity2 's @entity123 reported from @entity0 for this story , which was written by @entity125 in @entity126 .			0
