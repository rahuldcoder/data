-- hurtling across the @entity1 like an eternal explorer -- the @entity4 spacecraft continues to nonchalantly reveal the mysteries of the solar system to a captivated @entity8 audience			1
active volcanoes , methane rain , icy geysers and intricate details about @entity14 's rings -- the list of revelations attributed to the mission reads like fantastical sci - fi novel but it has revolutionized planetary astronomy			1
thirty - seven years after it launched , @entity4 is still out in the vast expanse of space , periodically relaying new data back home			1
but in 2013 , @entity25 made the groundbreaking announcement that @entity4 had left the heliosphere -- a magnetic boundary " bubble , " if you will , which scientists use to explain the separation of our solar system from the rest of the galaxy			1
" that means @entity4 has traveled outside the bubble of our sun , " explains voyager project manager @entity37			0
" the data @entity4 sends us now is data from other stars and from super nova eruptions and the remnant of stars that have exploded over the course of history			0
" it 's an incredible achievement for a probe built for an initial five - year mission			2
but now , not for the first time since the extraordinary statement , doubts have been cast on whether the craft has actually made the historic crossing			0
while measurements allowed @entity25 to feel confident enough to confirm @entity4 had entered interstellar space , two @entity61 scientists who have worked on the @entity4 missions remain skeptical			1
" this controversy will continue until it is resolved by measurements , " said @entity65 , a @entity61 professor of atmospheric , oceanic and space sciences , and lead author of a new study , in an @entity72 press release			0
see : @entity75 maps through the ages to that end , @entity65 and fellow @entity61 professor and study co-author @entity77 , predict that when @entity4 does cross the threshold into interstellar space , the probe will identify a reversal in the magnetic field , which will be relayed back to scientists on @entity86 , conclusively determining the spacecraft 's location			2
they expect this magnetic field shift to occur in the next two years , and if it does n't , this would confirm that @entity4 has already left the heliosphere			2
but while we may not know the exact location of @entity4 , we do know that it 's one of the most successful spacecraft of all time			2
' the little spacecraft that could ' launched individually in the summer of 1977 , @entity4 was a twin - spacecraft primary mission developed by @entity25 to explore @entity101 and @entity14 and their larger moons			1
following successful completion of the @entity4 mission 's primary objectives , a rare planetary alignment offered up remarkable opportunities for the two craft to continue space exploration			1
" @entity4 took advantage of alignment of the outer planets , which are @entity101 , @entity14 , @entity114 and @entity115 , to be able to go by all four of those planets in a 12 - year period			1
that alignment of planets only happens every 176 years , " says @entity37 -- who has described @entity4 as " the little spacecraft that could			2
" so in 1980 the @entity4 mission was officially extended and renamed the @entity122 mission			0
the probes were now participating in an exploratory odyssey to the farthest reaches of the heliosphere ... and beyond			0
through remote - control reprogramming -- a technological advancement unavailable at launch -- using @entity14 's gravitational field , the @entity4 probe was fired like a slingshot on a trajectory that would take it onwards into interstellar space			1
meanwhile @entity136 was redirected onto a new flight path , taking in the sights of @entity115 and @entity114 , before it will eventually follow its counterpart out of the heliosphere			1
to this day , it remains the only man - made object to have visited @entity115 and @entity114			1
not bad for vintage technology that has just 70 kilobytes of memory on board ; a 16 gigabyte iphone 5 has more than 240,000 times that amount			0
voyager 1 is now so far from @entity86 that commands take more than 17 hours to reach it			0
but it will be a little while before the spacecraft will encounter any more planets			0
" it is going to take us 40,000 years to come within three light years of the next nearest sun or the next nearest star , " says @entity37			0
" and that is a long , long time			0
" see : @entity75 maps through the ages see : best selfies ... from space watch : stunning solar flares			0

launched in 1977 , @entity4 was part of a twin - spacecraft mission on a *multi-planet* tour
a rare planetary alignment let the mission travel past @entity101 , @entity14 , @entity114 , @entity115
the two @entity171 have provided *unparalleled* *insight* into our solar system
@entity25 announced @entity4 had left heliosphere last year , but some *dispute* that
