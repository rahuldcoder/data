the couple divorced in 1968			0
" he was gracious enough to allow us to join him on the jet to take my dad to @entity14 , " says @entity2 " i remember we came off the jet , walked down the runway , hugged , ( we said ) ' hey , how you doin ' ? ' and he went that way with the entourage , and we went this way			2
and that was the last i ever saw him			0
" that was in may 2006 , at a time when @entity3 was cementing his legacy as one of golf 's greatest			1

@entity49 says he has reached out through phone calls and letters , but got no response			1
" i have no grudge against him			0
i 'm a little angry , " he says			0
" but , if he chooses to contact and to be in contact , we would love that			0
you know , we have unconditional love for him , whether he contacts us or not			0
" @entity49 wants @entity3 to respond because @entity8 is sick			1
he has multiple sclerosis and his health has declined 40 percent in the past two years , @entity49 says			1
" @entity8 does n't want this to be a big to - do about his condition , " @entity49 says			1
" but , you know , it makes me a little angry that ... there is this issue with trying to get the news to him			0
and it 's been so difficult			0
it 's like he does n't care			2
i kinda feel that he does			0
" @entity0 twice reached out to @entity78 ' management company for this documentary			1
woods did n't return messages seeking comment			0
when @entity3 , born in 1975 , was just starting out as a golfer , @entity49 , who was a tool and die maker , says he cut down some clubs and worked in the shop getting them ready for the pint - sized lad			1

" @entity3 played other sports too -- soccer and cross-country -- but @entity3 excelled at golf from an early age , @entity49 says			1

@entity2 , a retired military officer , was a dominating presence			2
many people wonder if @entity3 changed greatly after his father died			1

and he thinks it would be different if @entity2 were still around			2
" my @entity129 let @entity3 be his own man when he was alive , " @entity49 says			1
" but i think that @entity3 felt an obligation to make my father proud of him and not get caught up in -- the different things that some popular people get caught up in and that he had to live his life walking down a certain path			1
" but with him gone , i do n't know if there 's anybody in his group that holds him to task anymore			0
" his half - brother lost his way , he says			1
" what i saw was that -- he lost a part of himself , " he says			0
" i think that our father was a part of @entity3 so much that , when he passed , @entity3 became lost			2
that he did n't know how to fill that void			0
" but the @entity3 talked about by media and critics is n't the real @entity78 , he says			2
@entity3 is n't arrogant , just very confident of his abilities , @entity49 says			1
and he feels that as a golfer he needs to conduct himself a certain way with people			0
some people misinterpret that as aloofness , his brother says			0
some may question why @entity49 is speaking now			2
