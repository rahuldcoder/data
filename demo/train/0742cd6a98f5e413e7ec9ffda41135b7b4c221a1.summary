they are a type of sea slug that grows to be about a foot long			1
with only 20,000 nerve cells -- compared with about 100 billion found in the human brain -- aplysia are the perfect lab animals for brain researchers hoping to isolate a crucial connection			1
plus , " they 're just attractive to look at , " says dr. @entity11 , a biochemistry and biophysics professor at @entity14			1
@entity11 won the 2000 @entity16 for his work with @entity2 -- or more specifically , for his work on the biological mechanisms of memory storage			1
for decades , @entity11 has studied how we create short - term and long - term memories at the molecular level			1
his work has shown what genes are changed during the learning process , how these genes are altered and how the changes contribute to the growth of new connections in the brain			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity11 about his research and why he 's fascinated by the human brain			1
the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity0 : why do you think the @entity16 committee recognized your work ? dr. @entity11 : there are two forms ( of memory )			1
one is complex forms of memory , which require the hippocampus and ( are called ) explicit memory storage			1
the very simple forms like driving a car -- once you know how to do it , you do it automatically -- we call that implicit memory storage			1
and the two involve different systems in the brain			1
being a romantic , i started out with @entity59 to study the hippocampus			1
i 'm thinking , ' that 's the seat of complex memory , and i want to get complicated			1
' and we succeeded to record from the hippocampus			1
we were the first scientists to do this and we were euphoric			1
a medical miracle : saving cholera victims but after a while , we realized that studying the cells in a region involved in memory is necessary but not sufficient			1
you 've got to see how a memory is formed			1
you 've got to see how information comes into the hippocampus and how it is stored over the long term			1
and when we tried to see what comes into the hippocampus , we found it very complicated to analyze			1
so i realized we had to take a very different approach			2
rather than studying the most complex form of memory in a very complicated animal , we had to take the most simple form -- an implicit form of memory -- in a very simple animal			1
so i began to look around for very simple animals			1
and i focused in on the marine snail @entity2			2
my colleagues and i found that learning involves alterations in the strength of communication between nerve cells			2
nerve cells communicate with one another at specialized points called synapses			2
and these synapses are plastic -- they can be modified by learning			2
if you produce a short - term memory -- if you look up a telephone number you just remember for a short period of time ( or ) you meet somebody and remember their name briefly -- you have a transient change in the strength of communication			1
but if you have a long - term memory , you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections			1
so as i tell my friends , if you remember anything about this conversation , you will have a different brain than you started out with before the conversation			2
@entity0 : so would memory work the same in a human as it does in a snail ? in other words , is what you 've discovered applicable to us ? @entity11 : yes and no. obviously human memory is much more complicated than memory of a snail			1
we can learn things that they ca n't learn , obviously			2
we ( have ) conscious experiences as well as unconscious experiences			2
so the level of complexity is infinitely greater			2
but the remarkable thing that @entity137 discovered is that evolution is very conservative			2
if it finds through natural selection that some set of mechanisms work , it tends to retain those mechanisms in perpetuity			1
and this is what one finds with the learning process			2
10 women who changed medicine @entity0 : what led you to neuroscience research ? @entity11 : i had no interest in science whatsoever			1
i went to medical school after having decided to do so somewhere between my junior and senior year at @entity160 -- very late			2
i initially wanted to be an intellectual historian			2
and i did n't particularly enjoy the science courses ; even in medical school , i enjoyed the clinical work much more than the basic science courses			1
but i found working in the lab is so completely different than reading a textbook about it			2
you know , you 're planning strategies ; you 're working with your own hands			2
there 's essential satisfaction in running experiments			2
i remember having dinner with my wife before we were married and telling her , ' you know , i can see doing this for the rest of my life , but it 's ridiculous			2
you do n't have any money and i do n't have any money			0
we want to raise a family , and i 've got to earn a living going into private practice			0
' and she goes , ' money is of no significance			0
' she has never uttered those magic words again , i can assure you ( laughs )			0
but that , at the moment , was quite inspirational			0
@entity0 : why has memory research held your attention for so long ? @entity11 : well , i think it 's a fascinating problem because it 's so central to everything we do			1
i once had the privilege of going to a @entity203 retrospective at @entity204 ( the @entity204 in @entity205 )			0
@entity203 already had alzheimer 's disease			0
with alzheimer 's disease , you lose explicit memory , complicated memory , so he would have difficulty recognizing people			0
but he would go into studio , and he 'd be another person because for a gifted painter , painting is like an implicit skill			0
it 's like driving a car -- after you learn it , you can do it automatically			0
and he did some beautiful paintings when he had fairly advanced alzheimer 's disease			0
@entity222 -- the choir conductor in @entity223 -- had a severe explicit memory deficit			0
he could n't recognize people , places			0
but when he sat down at the piano , he could play almost as well as he ever did			0
if you ask him afterward , ' what 's it like to play the piano ? ' he would say , ' what are you talking about ? i have n't played the piano in 20 years			0
the other reason memory is so important is there is a number of a diseases that affect memory storage , and we 'd like to know how they work so we can try to remedy them			1
@entity246 's death inspires doctor 's work @entity0 : there 's been a lot of talk lately about " mapping " the brain			1
why is that important ? @entity11 : the brain is the most complex object in the universe			1
and it is so important that we understand it , not only to understand ourselves and who we are , but also to be able to overcome many of the miseries that affect the brain			0
it 's not just schizophrenia and depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety syndromes and autism			0
it 's @entity270 's disease and parkinson 's disease and alzheimer 's disease -- dreadful disorders that we want to be able to help people with			0
so this is a major challenge			0
to see the president of the @entity277 announce this first , in his @entity279 address , and then more recently at the @entity280 -- and i had the privilege of being there -- is very exciting			0
they introduced president @entity285 by saying , this is our scientist in chief , and @entity285 broadly took on that title			0
so i think it 's wonderful			0
@entity0 : in 2004 , you said that we could have effective memory drugs in two years			0
why do you think that 's proved to be a bit more difficult than expected ? @entity11 : we have a reasonably good understanding of the molecular underpinnings of age - related memory loss			1
with alzheimer 's disease , i think the understanding is surprisingly good			0
but if we 're so smart , how come we 're not rich ? how come we do n't have treatments for @entity303 's disease ? there are two possibilities -- one is that we 're deceiving ourselves and our understanding is much less complete than we think it is			0
or , and i think this is a real possibility , we are starting to treat people too late in the disorder			0
by the time they come to us with symptoms of alzheimer 's disease , they 've had the disease for 10 years			0
now if , @entity320 forbid , somebody has breast cancer or colon cancer for 10 years and you sought treatment then , that 's pretty darn late if they 're ( even ) still alive at that particular point with this severe form of cancer			0
so the whole thrust in alzheimer 's disease -- or at least an important thrust -- is to try to get early diagnoses so we can treat people much earlier than we are now treating them			0
@entity0 : when you first began your research , did you think we 'd get this far ? @entity11 : well , you know , it 's a relative thing			1
when i started , we knew , on the level that i now work , practically nothing			1
we knew the anatomy a bit , we knew a lot from clinical insights , but we had very little insight into the underlying mechanism			0
and we 've made a lot of progress on that , not just in learning but in perception and motor coordination and development			0
but if you look at where we want to go , what we ultimately want to understand , and how large the task is , one has to be very modest			0
... there 's much , much more to be studied , and much , much more to be learned			0
moreover , the clinical benefits that we 've gained out of what we 've learned so far have been modest			0
the best is yet to come .			0
