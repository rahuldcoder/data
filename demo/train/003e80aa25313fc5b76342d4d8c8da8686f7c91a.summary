" this whole year has been insane , and these are surprises beyond my wildest fantasies because we 've come a long f --- ing way , man			0
people did n't believe in us and it 's pretty awesome just to get that acknowledgment			0

reactions to his music range from generation - based bewilderment to genre purists ' outright hatred			2
