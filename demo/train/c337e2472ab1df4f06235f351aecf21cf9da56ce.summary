@entity0 -- one summer night in 2004 , 3 - year - old @entity2 lay asleep on a couch not far from her 6 - year - old brother on a chair in the living room			1
their father was sleeping in a nearby bedroom			2
the @entity11 joined the search for the killer of 3 - year - old @entity2 last month			1
just before 8 a.m. , @entity14 was awakened by his son			0
the boy told his father that @entity2 was missing from the sofa			1
@entity2 searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their @entity21 , @entity22 , home and then called police , according to authorities			1
his wife , @entity26 , was in @entity27 participating in a charity walk , and when she found out , she rushed home			2
nearly 500 volunteers , along with police and family , searched for the little girl			0
her body was found later that day in a river in @entity36 , @entity22 , just 4 miles from the family 's home			1
she 'd been bound and gagged with duct tape , raped and drowned , according to the @entity40 and the coroner 's report			0
it was june 6 , 2004 , the start of a horrific ordeal for the family			2
@entity2 was arrested and charged with the killing , only to be exonerated by dna evidence			1
more than five years later , authorities have yet to capture @entity2 's killer			1
@entity51 , @entity2 's attorney , said that the crime scene was brutal and that the theory is that @entity2 was snatched from her home , sexually assaulted and then thrown from the bridge overlooking the river where she drowned			1
because her hands were bound and her mouth covered with duct tape , she was unable to swim or save herself , @entity51 said			0
according to @entity51 , @entity2 says that the night his daughter disappeared , he had gone to a street fair while the children 's grandparents looked after them			2
on his way home , about midnight , @entity65 picked up his two sleepy children from their grandparents and put them to bed in the living room of the 500 - square - foot cement box family home			1
@entity2 often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6 - year - old brother on the chair near her while watching tv , @entity51 said			1
@entity2 has said the front door was wide open when he awoke , @entity51 said , as was the back door			2
he has said he locked the front door before he 'd gone to bed			0
the back door 's lock had been broken weeks ago ; they typically propped a stack of laundry baskets against it to keep it shut			0
according to the family , those baskets had been removed and placed on top of the laundry machine by someone other than family members			0
" from the beginning , we believed that someone was already inside the house waiting when @entity14 got home with the kids that night , " @entity94 said			0
" but it was clear that police were looking at @entity14 suspiciously			0
" indeed , five months later , @entity105 sheriff 's officers arrested and charged @entity14 with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter			0
@entity51 says the arrest came after authorities coerced a confession from him after 14 hours of relentless questioning			0
@entity2 spent eight months in jail , but dna evidence from the rape kit conducted on @entity2 's body finally exonerated him			1
there was no semen found during the autopsy , @entity51 says , but saliva of an unidentified male was found on the duct tape covering @entity2 's mouth and elsewhere on her body			1
in late 2007 , the family won a $ 15.5 million wrongful - arrest suit against the sheriff 's detectives			2
the foxes believe that the perpetrator was someone in the community who had been watching and targeting their daughter for some time			0
" for weeks before her disappearance , i could n't shake a feeling of uneasiness , strange noises at night outside our house , as if someone were lurking and watching us , " @entity94 said			0
@entity51 believes that another big clue was a red car similar to a @entity144 parked outside the @entity65 home that night , before @entity14 and his children returned home			0
" it 's only been in the last few weeks that investigators have actively begun pursuing this case again , " @entity51 said , " even though @entity14 was cleared nearly four years ago			0
" last month , the @entity11 joined the investigation at the request of @entity105 state attorney @entity153			1
@entity11 agents combed @entity2 's neighborhood and talked with neighbors and other potential witnesses			1
" the @entity11 is bringing unprecedented resources and expertise to this investigation , " @entity153 said in a statement			2
" we can not allow this horrific crime against an innocent child to remain unsolved			0
" the family is offering a $ 100,000 reward , and the @entity11 is offering $ 10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for @entity2 's death			1
anyone with more information is urged to call the @entity11 's @entity27 office at 312 - 421 - 6700 .			2
