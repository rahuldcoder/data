@entity0 -- the man charged in the failed @entity6 bombing was working with the @entity8 movement in @entity9 , the @entity3 attorney general said sunday			1
" the evidence that we have now developed shows the @entity9 @entity8 directed this plot , " attorney general @entity10 said , describing the investigation into suspect @entity12 during an appearance on @entity15 's " @entity14			1
" " we know that they helped facilitate it , we know they helped direct it , and i suspect we 're going to come up with evidence that shows they helped to finance it , " @entity10 said			0
@entity26 , the assistant to the president for counterterrorism and homeland security , told @entity1 's " @entity31 " that the @entity9 @entity8 -- also known as @entity8 , or @entity8 -- is closely allied with @entity30			1
the group has pledged to carry out attacks outside of central @entity34 , including the @entity3 , @entity26 said sunday			2
@entity12 has been charged in the may 1 attempted bombing in @entity6			1
he was arrested while trying to fly out of @entity36 on monday night , two days after he allegedly attempted to set off a car bomb in @entity6			1
the bomb failed to detonate			0
it was the second case in the past six months of a bungled terrorist attack in the @entity3 , following the failed bombing of a @entity3 airliner on christmas day			2
@entity26 said @entity3 counterterrorism efforts had degraded the ability of groups such as @entity30 and the @entity8 to launch successful attacks			1
" they 're trying to find vulnerabilities in our defenses , " @entity26 said , noting the attempts have been " unsophisticated			1
" @entity12 , a @entity52 , had traveled to @entity9 several times in recent years , @entity26 said			1
" he was captured by the murderous rhetoric of @entity30 and @entity8 , " @entity26 said of the suspect			2
preventing attacks by individuals , especially @entity3 citizens such as @entity12 , is a " very difficult challenge , " @entity26 said			1
the case raised new questions about whether terrorism suspects should be read the @entity63 that advises them of their rights to remain silent and obtain legal representation			2
critics have accused the @entity68 administration of losing interrogation opportunities by giving @entity71 warnings to terrorism suspects , including the alleged @entity74 airplane bomber and @entity12			1
@entity26 said @entity12 was interrogated for four hours under an exclusion to the @entity63 involving public safety			1
authorities then advised @entity12 of his rights , as required by law , @entity26 told the " @entity81 " program			2
" it did not impede our ability to continue to acquire very important intelligence from him , " @entity26 said			0
" it was , i think , a very good example that law enforcement , operating within ... the existing system , were able to leverage the opportunities that they had to get this information			0
" also on the @entity81 program , @entity93 rep. @entity93 argued a change in the @entity71 warning was necessary			0
" if there 's another 10 , 15 , 20 plots out there , that to me is more important to get all the intelligence we can on that , " @entity93 said			0
" so i think we may have to work on revisions			0
" one idea , @entity93 said , would set up " separate system of justice dealing with @entity3 citizens who are allied with a foreign army or a foreign enemy			0
" @entity10 also said sunday that he was considering possible changes to the @entity63			0
asked whether international terrorism made the current @entity71 warnings too limited , @entity10 told the @entity115 program " @entity117 " that some adjustment may be necessary			0
the system is working so far , @entity10 said , but " we also want to ... make determinations as to whether or not we have the necessary flexibility , whether we have a system that can deal with the situation that agents now confront			0
" " we 're now dealing with international terrorism , " @entity10 said , adding that his department would work with @entity126 " to come up with a proposal that is both constitutional , but that is also relevant to our time and the threat that we now face			0
