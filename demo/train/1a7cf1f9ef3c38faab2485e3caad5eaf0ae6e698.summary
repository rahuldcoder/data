@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 lawmakers tuesday recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa , the full - body covering worn by some @entity10 women			1
the ban on the " voile integrale " -- which literally means " total veil " -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools , and on public transport , a @entity1 parliamentary commission announced			1
it would also apply to anyone who attempts to receive public services , but it would not apply to people wearing the burqa on the street , the commission said			1
the commission stopped short of recommending a full ban because not all of the 32 commission members could agree on it			0
they will now recommend that @entity29 pass a resolution on the partial ban			0
such a resolution , if passed , would not make the wearing of a full veil or burqa illegal , but it would give public officials support when asking people to remove it			1
commission members began their work six months ago after @entity1 president @entity41 controversially told lawmakers that the full veil was " not welcome " in @entity1			1
@entity41 said the issue is one of a woman 's freedom and dignity , and did not have to do with religion			0
the @entity50 assembled a cross-party panel of 32 lawmakers to study whether women in @entity1 should be allowed to wear the burqa -- or any other full veil , including the niqab , which shows only the eyes			1
the commission also studied whether such full veils pose a threat to @entity1 's constitutionally mandated secularism			2
commission members heard from 200 people from all areas of @entity1 society , including @entity10 , though they only heard from one woman who wears a veil			1
by recommending a ban on full veils in public places such as hospitals and schools and by anyone receiving public services , the commission members said they wanted to assist those working with members of the public when asking that full veils be removed			1
that would include school teachers who meet children 's parents or ticket agents at train stations			0
a date for the vote in @entity29 has not been set , though it is unlikely to happen before regional elections which are scheduled for march 14 and 21			0
parliamentary majority leader @entity89 said this week he believed the resolution will pass			0
any law directed at full veils is likely to be challenged in the courts both in @entity1 and at the @entity94 level			2
more than half of @entity1 people support a full ban , according to a recent opinion poll			1
the @entity100 poll for @entity102 magazine found 57 percent of @entity1 people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face			1
that 's despite government estimates that less than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full @entity110 veil			1
@entity1 has about 3.5 million @entity10 , representing about six percent of the population , according to research by the @entity113			0
the country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining @entity1 's status as a secular state			0
@entity1 lawmakers believe the burqa is a growing phenomenon beneath which lies a not - so - subtle message of fundamentalism			1
those who advocate the ban say women are often forced to wear full veils by the men around them -- husbands , fathers or brothers -- and that it is a sign of subjugation			1
however , women who actually wear the veils deny that			0
" you are going to isolate these women and then you ca n't say that it is @entity110 that has denied them freedom , but that the law has , " said @entity137 , a language teacher of @entity140 origin			0
@entity137 , who at 28 is about to have her first child , says she came to wearing a full veil gradually , after wearing headscarves as an teenager			1
she said she believes a law against full veils would take away fundamental rights of @entity10 women			0
she and her friend @entity154 , who would not give her last name , say they prefer to cover their faces out of piety			0
the women , both @entity1 citizens , say they are only following their religious beliefs and @entity1 should respect that			2
but even some @entity10 in @entity1 think the full veil goes too far			1
there is nothing in the quran that directs women to cover their faces , said @entity166 , who runs the @entity110 center in @entity168 , a @entity0 suburb			0
he said it is ridiculous to do so in @entity1			0
@entity1 already has a law against @entity10 girls wearing headscarves in state schools			2
it sparked widespread @entity10 protests when the @entity1 @entity29 passed the law in 2004 , even though the law also bans other conspicuous religious symbols including @entity180 turbans , large @entity182 crucifixes and @entity184 skull caps			2
in 2008 , @entity1 's top court denied a @entity188 woman 's naturalization request on the grounds that she wore a burqa			2
@entity1 is not the only @entity192 country to consider banning the burqa			2
@entity195 lawmakers voted in favor of a ban in 2005 , although the government at the time left office before legislation could be passed			0
-- @entity2 's @entity202 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
