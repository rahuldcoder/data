-- the tour of @entity2 by @entity3 this week had all the trappings of an official visit by a popular head of state			1
there were the staged photos of the @entity11 chief executive 's handshake with the @entity2 vice-premier and of his visit to an @entity15 production line , not forgetting the " man of the people " shot of him posing with customers at an @entity21			1
mr @entity3 is , after all , the head of a company whose $ 108bn in sales in its last fiscal year was equivalent to the gross domestic product of @entity29			2
the @entity11 chief appeared to be revered and his attention to @entity2 appreciated by ordinary people			1
" it is laudable that he shows up here , where people work so hard to make @entity11 products and spend so much money to buy them , " said one of many comments on @entity35 , @entity2 's leading @entity36 equivalent			1
but while this was , by all accounts , a successful diplomatic and trade mission , its political implications spread well beyond @entity2 's borders			0
the visit appeared timed to coincide with thursday 's release of the @entity51 's report on conditions in @entity2 factories where @entity11 products are made			1
it found at least 50 " serious and pressing non-compliances " with its own workplace code of conduct and @entity2 labour law			2
@entity11 's welcoming of the report 's recommendations and mr @entity3 's visit to the factory floor seemed intended to soothe international criticism that alleged @entity11 made huge profits on the back of poorly paid and badly treated assembly workers in @entity2			1
dozens of labour rights organisations from the @entity69 to @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 wrote an open letter to mr @entity3 this week demanding @entity11 provide a living wage for @entity2 workers so they did not have to work excessive overtime			1
they wanted an end to the use of involuntary labour in the shape of student interns and called for staff to be given health and safety training and the ability to form a genuine trade union			0
the recommendations of the @entity51 and the agreement to them by @entity11 and its main supplier @entity88 appear to answer these points			0
there were commitments that would reduce working hours to legal limits while protecting pay and improving conditions			0
" if implemented , these commitments will significantly improve the lives of more than 1.2m @entity88 employees and set a new standard for @entity2 factories , " said @entity97 , @entity51 president			1
but perceptions of @entity2 conditions and @entity11 and @entity88 's behaviour are different in @entity2 itself , where jobs in the factories are seen as highly desirable and paying well above the going rate			1
a queue of 1,000 people awaited interviews outside a @entity88 facility near @entity114 last month			0
a younger generation of @entity2 also have a different work ethic -- preferring to work excessively to get the money they need and then leaving a company -- giving employers like @entity88 the problem of a high turnover rate , one of the biggest issues faced by @entity2 manufacturers			0
the promise to the @entity51 of more substantial basic pay may actually help @entity88 keep employees longer term			0
indirectly , being seen as a force for higher pay and better working conditions in @entity2 may also help to support @entity11 's recent efforts to appeal to @entity2 consumers			1
although @entity11 has recognised @entity2 in recent years as one of its fastest - growing markets , for a long time it did little to give it special treatment			1
its @entity2 subsidiary is run by a low - key former @entity142 executive , who industry insiders say has little clout with headquarters			1
in stark contrast to many other multinationals , which make great efforts to highlight their special commitment to @entity2 with local research and development , frequent new investments and customised products , @entity11 has refused to divert from the marketing strategy it uses in other markets			1
for a while , the delayed launches and scarce supply of its products in @entity2 seemed to fire up local consumers ' enthusiasm for the cult brand even further			2
but over the past year , the company started seeing limits to that approach and faced a series of challenges			0
its past two local product launches triggered riots involving the unlicensed resellers who have come to dominate the distribution and retailing of iphones and @entity176 in @entity2			0
following the launch of the new @entity176 this month , @entity2 customs started stricter checks aimed at stopping smugglers from bringing in the device for resale in the country			0
this week , a crackdown on grey - market @entity15 resellers in the southern city of @entity114 triggered a suspension of @entity15 sales by a number of unlicensed online traders			0
@entity11 is also fighting a legal battle over the @entity2 @entity176 trademark , which is registered under the name of @entity195 , a struggling technology firm			1
analysts expect @entity11 to swallow much , if not all , of the costs of the improvements recommended by the @entity51 labour rights organisations have pointed out @entity88 's limited ability to do so with profit margins falling as low as 1.5 per cent compared with those of more than 30 per cent for @entity11			2
@entity88 has already implemented a series of wage increases over the past two years			0
" when @entity88 hiked wages the last time , @entity11 paid for it , " said @entity205 , head of asia ex-japan tech hardware research at @entity207			2
" @entity11 used to pay @entity88 $ 8 for every @entity15 and $ 10 for every @entity176 , but they hiked the price by about 30 per cent			0
" the larger burden for @entity11 is part of a shift that has been under way since 2010			0
when @entity88 announced its first wage increase after a series of suicides among its @entity2 workers , it said the time had come for other parts of the technology value chain to shoulder some of the soaring labour costs in @entity2			2
" there does seem to be a new trend that customers [ of contract manufacturers ] are more willing to share the cost when it comes to labour - related issues , " said @entity223 , analyst at @entity224			0
@entity232 , a technology analyst with @entity233 , said the review of @entity11 's supply chain , which is being continued by the @entity51 beyond the initial three @entity88 factories , was likely to influence other contract manufacturers as well			2
" particularly , @entity238 , which plays an important role in the @entity241 space , and @entity242 , which assembles @entity15 , are likely to come under similar examination , " he said			0
with a huge share of contract manufacturing for the global supply chain done in @entity2 , many companies with smaller financial resources than @entity11 -- the world 's most valuable company by market capitalisation -- will be viewing the cost of this week 's events with trepidation			1
