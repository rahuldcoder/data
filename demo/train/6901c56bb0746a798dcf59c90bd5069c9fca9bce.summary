a senior administration official said that @entity1 's release was the result of direct contact between @entity47 and @entity48			1

the @entity34 report stated that investigators had determined that " @entity1 entered the @entity4 with a wrong understanding of it and perpetrated a hostile act against it			1
" " taking into consideration his admittance of the act committed by him on the basis of his wrong understanding ( and the ) apology made by him for it , his sincere repentance of it and his advanced age and health condition , the above - said institution deported him from the country from a humanitarian viewpoint , " the official @entity4 report said			1

" it 's a positive thing they 've done , " said the vice president , who spoke saturday morning by phone with @entity1			1
" but they still have mr. @entity86 , who has no reason being held in the @entity4 ( and ) should be released immediately			1
" " while the release of @entity1 is welcome news indeed , he never should have been detained in the first place , " said former @entity127 gov. @entity126 , who has undertaken private diplomatic efforts with @entity4			1
" @entity132 should also release @entity86 as a humanitarian gesture			0
" @entity2 ' deeply concerned ' about citizens held in @entity4 old resentments @entity1 had traveled in october as a tourist to @entity4 on a 10 - day organized private tour of @entity4			1
phone calls and postcards he sent indicated that the trip was going well and gave no indication of a problem , @entity59 said			0
the day before @entity1 was to leave , " one or two @entity4 authorities " met with him and his tour guide , the son added			1
they talked about @entity1 's service record , which left " my dad ... a bit bothered , " he said			2
then , just minutes before his @entity23 - bound plane was set to depart @entity48 in late october , @entity1 was taken off the aircraft by @entity4 authorities			1
for weeks , the @entity48 government offered no explanation as to why they were holding @entity1			2
an explanation came a few days ago , when state media published and broadcast what they described as the @entity33 veteran 's " apology			2
" the word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions			0
in the note -- which was dated november 9 -- @entity1 talked about his having advised the @entity167 , part of the " intelligence bureau " fighting against @entity48 during the @entity33			0
he detailed how he commanded troops to collect " information " and wage deadly attacks			0
" after i killed so many civilians and ( @entity4 ) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the @entity4 during the @entity33 , i committed indelible offensive acts against the @entity4 government and @entity4 people , " @entity1 said , according to that @entity34 report			1
the reported message also touched on his return 60 years later to @entity4 , saying that he " shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers			0
" his statement ended : " if i go back to ( the ) @entity2 , i will tell the true features of the @entity4 and the life the @entity4 people are leading			0
" photos show scale of @entity4 's repressive prison camps " @entity192 acts " this public apology was " highly scripted political theater , " said @entity196 , professor @entity195			1
some feared @entity1 could face harsh treatment			0
@entity86 was arrested in november 2012 and sentenced last may to 15 years of hard labor after @entity4 's government found him guilty of " hostile acts " and attempts to topple the government			2
@entity48 is regarded by many as one of the world 's most repressive states , with its insularity , system of cruel detention camps for political prisoners and sharp restrictions on speech and other freedoms			0
its isolation is exacerbated by widespread concern over its nuclear program			0
the @entity220 nation 's reported quest to create a nuclear weapon , as well as its resistance to international monitoring of its activities , have resulted in economic sanctions , compounding its difficulties in getting enough energy and food for its people			0
@entity232 's release may serve to relax tensions with the @entity2			0
but above all , it will please his wife , who last month told @entity0 , " we need to have @entity232 back at the head of the table for the holidays			0
" other detained @entity2 @entity0 's @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0
