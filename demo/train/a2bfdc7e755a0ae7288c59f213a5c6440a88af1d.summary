he might be responsible for reviving one of the worst moments in the history of sunglasses -- the " shutter shades " -- but rapper @entity6 is hoping that all will be forgiven as he debuts his own line at @entity9 later this month			1
according to @entity12 , the " @entity11 " hit - maker has hired @entity14 - based designer @entity13 -- known for her vivid , eye - catching designs -- as one of the creative leads developing this new signature range of womenswear			1
but as we wait to discover what @entity6 has up his sleeve , it remains to be seen if the superstar 's foray into fashion will prove a wise career move			1
and anyway , does the world really need another celebrity clothing line ? from the multi-million - dollar empires of pop - singers - cum - fashion - moguls @entity32 and @entity34 to the quietly shelved apparel of @entity36 and " @entity37 " star @entity38 , the celebrity fashion game is rarely a predictable business			1
according to branding expert @entity41 , celebrity clothing brands are particularly mercurial because their success is so closely aligned to just one individual -- whose popularity can slump at the drop of a finely tailored hat			1
" before they start , they really have to ask themselves why they want to do it in the first place , " says @entity41 , who works for international brand consultancy firm " i - am			2
" " the principle of celebrity ranges is sound , as long as the star in question can add value , " he says			1
" for instance , look at @entity62			0
here 's a tennis star who could draw on his knowledge and expertise to create a credible sportswear brand that has endured even beyond his own life and career			0
" it 's a view shared by @entity70 , president and ceo of specialist marketing consultancy celebrity @entity72			2
" success or failure in this industry boils down to one word : authenticity , " he says			0
" consumers are n't stupid and they can generally tell when a celebrity is just doing it for the money while having no interest in the product			2
" @entity70 cites singers @entity86 and @entity88 as stars with sturdy fashion credentials			2
@entity86 is an established style icon , he says , who was known for concocting her own designs long before creating her label l.a.m.b. meanwhile , @entity88 's line , " @entity92 " pays tribute to her maternal grandmother @entity98 -- a respected seamstress born in the 1920s			1
but , according to @entity70 , many other stars are guilty of sheer opportunism			0
" take the @entity111 sisters , " he says , in reference to the @entity104 socialites who recently launched their own range , " @entity109 " at the @entity107 chain of department stores			0
" i mean , give me a break , " says @entity70			0
" @entity107 is where people go to get a good deal on a washing machine or bag of tools			0
the partnership just does n't make sense , it 's not authentic			0
" it 's not hard to see why every celebrity and their mother ( @entity123 -- mom of @entity36 -- attempted to launch a budget shoe line in 2009 ) are hoping to cash in on their own brand of garments			1
all you have to do is follow the money			0
according to @entity134 magazine , @entity34 's eponymous shoe and accessories brand is on its way to becoming the first celebrity label to rake in over $ 1 billion of sales , while @entity88 's husband and @entity6 label - mate , @entity138 sold the rights to his urban - flavored clothing range @entity142 for $ 204 million in 2007			1
then there 's @entity146 's lingerie business , @entity147 ; the eclectic lifestyle collection @entity149 and @entity150 from former child - star twins @entity153 and @entity152 ; and who could forget @entity156 's critically adored self - monikered couture brand -- all of which are in the black			2
" but for every celebrity that makes it big , there 's another screaming at their agents saying : ' they have a line , so i should have a line , ' " according to @entity70 , who says that most of his business comes from celebrities reaching out to him through their agents			2
" let me tell you , we turn down more than we take on , " he adds			0
amid all this , how do " professional " designers feel about celebrity big names treading on their turf ? " from a business perspective it 's clearly a good idea , " says @entity180 - based menswear designer @entity179 , who 's currently exhibiting at @entity181			1
" but i 'm not a fan from a design point of view			0
" according to @entity179 , it can be " quite frustrating " for those that spend their lives studying and working to build a reputation in fashion to watch as celebrities " waltz in and launch a label overnight			1
" this is especially true , he says , " when they cherry - pick ideas from relatively unknown designers and sell cheaper copies to a wider audience			2
" that said , @entity179 believes the fashion establishment can also be guilty of snobbery when it comes to " outsiders			0
" " it 's just clothes after all ... and , you know , celebrity fashion lines are alright when they capture a personality			1
i like ( former @entity213 singer ) @entity215 's label @entity215 because it just looks like all the stuff he 'd wear himself			1
" so what advice for @entity6 before his big day on the catwalk ? branding expert @entity41 has a sharp word of warning for any celebrity tempted to put their ego before common sense : " whatever you do , do n't make too much			1
never over-order , so you leave the public wanting more			0
if your product is stuck on the clearance counter , you 've had it			0

rapper @entity6 will launch his own fashion label at forthcoming @entity9
