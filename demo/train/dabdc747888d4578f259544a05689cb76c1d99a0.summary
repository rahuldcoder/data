-- @entity2 's movie is about women and breast cancer			1
and it 's airing on @entity6			1
uh oh , this could get weepy			2
@entity2 , who has starred in cable show " @entity9 , " knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get			1
" this was something different , " she said , of the film , which airs monday at 9 p.m. " i spoke with @entity6 and they wanted it to be a new approach and a new way of looking at cancer			1
" the actress has seen the disease 's toll			2
" like all women , i had been affected , " she said			1
" women in my family dealt with breast cancer			1
it was important for me to do this on a lot of different levels			2
it was n't just a paycheck			2
" the movie , " @entity31 " tells stories of different women coping with breast cancer in five vignettes			1
@entity2 's character , an oncologist is the tie that binds the five stories together			1
her character loses her mother to breast cancer as a young girl and becomes an oncologist			1
the project has a bevy of star power			2
the executive producers are @entity49 , @entity50 , co-creator of the series " friends " and @entity53 , who was the executive producer of " @entity54			1
" @entity49 , @entity55 and @entity56 each directed one of the vignettes			1
the ensemble cast includes @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
@entity2 answered a few questions for @entity0 not long ago			1
@entity0 : did you work with an oncologist , or consult a doctor for your role ? @entity72 : i consulted an oncologist			2
the thing that i found confusing and frustrating is once you have this diagnosis , there is this maze of doctors			2
there was n't one particular way of dealing with a diagnosis			2
i was just very confused to the journey that one takes after a diagnosis			2
you have your mammogram , your radiologist , your oncologist			2
@entity49 [ @entity49 ] and her producing partner @entity53 [ @entity90 ] toured a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country			1
it 's almost a one - stop shop with everything a woman needs - the doctors , radiologists			0
it 's all under one roof			0
and hopefully that will simplify before we get a cure			0
@entity0 : what resonated with you about the story ? @entity72 : just the way they were telling the story -- the five short films dealing with different women with the diagnoses			1
i thought it was an interesting way of telling stories			1
five directors who are women , for me , personally , it was a great experience to work with each of these directors			1
@entity56 is a first time director			1
you would never know it when you see her film			0
@entity0 : did having family members who 've had breast cancer influence you in taking part in this project ? @entity72 : i had two women on my mother 's side of the family ; both went through bouts of breast cancer			1
my grandmother was a two - time survivor of breast cancer			1
she passed away of something different 15 years after her last diagnosis			0
it 's close to my heart and experience			0
@entity0 : having family members who 've had this disease , does it make you concerned about your risk ? @entity72 : it 's a constant reminder			0
it 's always in the news			0
it 's always out there			0
so , it 's just what you live with			0
it 's what you face			0
you try to watch your diet , you 're constantly aware of it			0
some people put their head in the sand and i 'm not that kind of person			0
i 'm very aware of it			0
@entity0 : your character in the movie gets genetic testing for breast cancer			1
have you ever thought about it ? @entity72 : i think it 's a personal thing			0
it 's not something that i 'm thinking of doing			0
@entity0 : what 's your message through this movie ? @entity72 : no woman should have to go through this			0
i 've seen it up close and personal			0
the fact that we 're airing this during @entity193 , it 's a small part that i could do -- if i could raise awareness , if women see this and get a mammogram			1
when i started this project , it had been two years since i got a mammogram , because i was so busy			0
that 's what happens with women			1
they are so busy taking care of other people , they do n't put themselves first			0
you have to go out and do these small things			0
getting a mammogram , doing your monthly self - exam , your diet , just taking care of yourself			0
if this film will remind women out there to do just that , that 's a step in the right direction			1
it 's not every project that you can do this -- that can possibly directly impact somebody 's life			0
and that was my hope .			0
