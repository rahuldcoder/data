@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity4 province -- once dominated by @entity6 insurgents but now a bastion of tribal opposition against the militants -- will soon be run by the @entity1 military			1
@entity1 soldiers will soon be responsible for running the once militant - riven province of @entity4			1
the @entity14 military said it would transfer security responsibility for @entity4 this week to the @entity1 military , a bellwether event that illustrates what @entity1 and the @entity14 describe as a profound stride in their efforts to foster stability			1
@entity4 is the 10th of the 18 provinces where @entity1 forces have taken charge of security control since the @entity14 - led invasion in 2003 and the first largely @entity6 @entity30 province to do so			1
the other provinces to take charge are in the @entity34 south and the @entity36 north			0
" we have seen a dramatic increase in security there , " said rear adm. @entity37 , @entity38 , speaking to reporters in @entity0 on sunday			0
" i think that the trend now in @entity4 is to move from the violent kinetic to the rebuilding process , " he said			0
anbar province -- west of @entity0 -- is a vast territory where @entity1 shares borders with @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51			2
much of the region is desert , and most of the people there live in in the towns and cities -- such as @entity59 and @entity60 -- along the @entity61			0
@entity6 , such as those in @entity4 , became politically marginalized when the @entity34 and @entity63 took over the new @entity1 government from the toppled @entity66 regime , which had been dominated by and was most amenable to @entity6			2
many @entity6 in @entity4 became active in the insurgency , and foreign fighters made their way into @entity4 via @entity49			0
as a result , the @entity61 valley region was a hotbed of insurgent activity in the early years of the @entity1 war			0
@entity14 @entity75 launched several offensives against the militants , including a large - scale push in late 2004 in @entity59			2
@entity79 in @entity1 and other militants eventually developed a strong foothold in many towns			2
major changes occurred in @entity4 over the last two years , however , with the emergence of the awakening , the grass - roots tribal movement that opposes @entity79 in @entity1			1
that movement aided efforts by the @entity14 military and @entity1 security forces to fight @entity79 in @entity1 ( @entity91 ) , and violence there has dropped dramatically in the last two years			1
while @entity6 tribes in @entity1 were natural allies for the insurgency when it started in 2003 , many locals eventually became disenchanted with what it regarded as @entity79 in @entity1 's brutality , corruption and hard - line enforcement of sharia law			2
the tribal movement in @entity4 has developed into a political force and has helped spawn another development : @entity14 - backed @entity1 militias -- such as @entity107 and @entity108 -- formed in the @entity6 regions of @entity1 over the last couple of years			1
the @entity112 's june report to @entity113 on developments in @entity1 said that in @entity4 , the " average number of security incidents remained at five incidents per day over a 90 - day period , accounting for less than 4 percent of the attacks in all of @entity1			1
" " this represents a 10-fold reduction compared to the summer of 2006 and is half of the rate of the last few months of 2007			0
" @entity91 " continues efforts to regain footholds " in the valley , the report said			0
but the @entity107 and @entity14 and @entity1 troops " continue to hinder @entity91 's ability to obtain resources or operate effectively in population centers , forcing @entity91 to operate and conduct attacks from remote locations in the province			1
" at present , the other provinces that have transitioned to @entity1 security control are @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 in the @entity36 region , and @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , and @entity144 in the @entity34 south			0
the other province to change over to @entity1 security control this year is @entity147 in the south .			0
