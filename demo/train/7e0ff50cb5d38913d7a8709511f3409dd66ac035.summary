hundreds of onlookers crowded around a booth inside the cavernous @entity2 , hoisting cameras overhead and straining for a glimpse of the woman with the tiny frame and the big fake eyelashes : @entity8			0
the " @entity10 " star , more officially but less - well known as @entity8 , was at the @entity11 here tuesday to promote a forthcoming line of headphones for @entity14 , a company that makes audio accessories			1
less than 200 yards away , a similar throng jammed the @entity18 booth , where hip - hop star @entity19 was appearing on behalf of his own brand of headphones			1
and on wednesday , pop singer @entity21 was scheduled to appear at a @entity11 event for @entity23 , a robotics company that 's unveiling an " entertainment robot			1
" these celebrity endorsements can certainly make headlines at @entity11 ( witness this article )			1
but will they translate into sales ? in recent years , celebs have a mixed track record when it comes to launching tech gadgets			2
musician dr. @entity34 has had success with @entity36 , his popular line of high - performance headphones			1
but singer @entity39 showed up at last year 's @entity11 to unveil a prototype of camera - equipped @entity42 sunglasses that never reached the market			1
" they definitely help attract people to the booth			0
you see people all crowding around the booth , and they 're not looking at the new @entity55 headset or whatever , they 're taking pictures of the celebrity , " said gadget analyst @entity48 of @entity49 , the consumer - electronics site			1
" it 's vegas -- it 's showtime			0
but whether it carries any weight ( beyond @entity11 ) , i do n't know			1
" a celebrity tech endorsement makes the most sense , @entity48 said , if the person has some expertise about the product -- witness all the musical artists ( @entity69 also is at @entity11 , as he was last year , with a line of headphones ) creating signature audio equipment			1
that 's something @entity19 understands			0
" it actually speaks to what i do for a living -- making music , " he told @entity75 in reference to his headphone venture			0
his product line , the wireless sync by 50 ( $ 399 ) and the wired street by 50 ( $ 299 ) , hit the market last month			2
the rapper also understands that some star wattage can bring attention to a gadget that might otherwise get lost in the sea of gadgets here			2
" ces is exciting , " he said			0
" but so many amazing things do n't have proper marketing in place yet , so people wo n't get a chance to see them			0
" back at the @entity14 booth , @entity8 sat at a table and smiled patiently while fans lined up for autographs and photos			2
she wore a leopard - print top , a short skirt and five - inch heels , and fiddled with her white @entity104 between visitors			2
sometimes , she sang along to the dance music being spun by the event 's dj. @entity8 was not available for interviews			0
but @entity14 spokeswoman @entity110 said the company approached the reality tv star to help build buzz around its products			1
" we built the line around the things that she likes , like animal prints and bling			2
she designed everything to fit her attitude and her fashion sense , " @entity110 said			0
" we knew that by having her , we could instantly attract fans , sponsors , press			0
the response has been tremendous			0
