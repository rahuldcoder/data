-- oh , to be a fly on the wall when this photo of @entity4 was taken			1
on wednesday at the @entity6 's women in @entity8 breakfast , @entity4 was photographed running into @entity9 , the @entity10 co-chairwoman whose emails were published by @entity12 this week after a massive hack of @entity10 's private data			1
@entity15 : what to know about the @entity10 mega-hack those emails have gone viral thanks to their insider information and very blunt chatter about actors like @entity4 , who was called " minimally talented " and a " spoiled brat " with a " rampaging ... ego " by producer @entity25			1
one would imagine that by the time @entity27 ran into @entity4 at wednesday 's @entity6 event , the actress - director herself would have heard about them			1
@entity15 : bringing down @entity10 was frighteningly easy it 's hard to tell from the picture whether that 's true , but that has n't stopped the internet from speculating			0
in the image , @entity27 approaches @entity4 as though she 's going in for a hug , wearing a facial expression that could be read as apologetic			1
@entity4 , meanwhile , meets @entity27 's gaze with a deadly serious expression			1
it is n't clear what kind of exchange the two women had on wednesday -- perhaps after the picture was snapped , they embraced with smiles			0
but one thing 's for sure : this is one photo worth a thousand words			2
@entity15 : @entity10 hack : @entity52 movie is way over budget @entity4 is n't the only famous name who 's been implicated in the hacking scandal			1
in another leaked email , comedian and actor @entity57 was called a " whore " by one @entity10 exec for wanting more money to promote a movie on social media beyond the $ 3 million he was receiving for the project			0
" i 'm not saying he 's a whore , but he 's a whore , " the exec said , according to an email published by @entity12			0
on @entity69 on thursday , @entity57 appeared to respond to the @entity71 nightmare , telling his fans that he knows his worth			0
" i look at myself as a brand , " @entity57 said , " and because of that , i will never be taken advantage of			0
" the fallout from @entity10 's leaked messages has even reached into politics , as one of @entity27 and @entity25 's leaked email exchanges included controversial jokes about president @entity83			1
@entity27 , who was set to attend a breakfast with the president and other @entity87 executives , emailed @entity25 to get his opinion on what she should ask @entity83			2
" would he like to finance some movies , " @entity25 responded			0
@entity27 emailed back , " i doubt it			2
should i ask him if he liked ( ' @entity94 ' ) ? " " 12 years , " was @entity25 's response , setting up a back - and - forth in which the two threw out movies starring african - americans			0
when @entity27 suggested that maybe it 's @entity103 ' " @entity102 " that the president would be partial to , @entity25 responded , " ride - along			2
i bet he likes @entity57			0
" suffice it to say the fallout has not been pretty			0
both @entity27 and @entity25 have apologized for their remarks about @entity83 , and @entity27 has reportedly reached out to leaders like @entity109 and the rev. @entity110 with a desire to " accept responsibility " for her comments .			1
