we have seen people unable to find insurance because of a pre-existing condition , " she said , likening the bill to a form of " justice " promised in the @entity49			0
see complete coverage of the health care bill another reader used sarcasm to suggest that people will find a way around paying premiums			1
i 'm just going to drop my insurance now , pay the $ 700 yearly fine , and then pickup insurance when i get sick since insurance companies ca n't deny me , " he wrote on the sound off section of a @entity0 news story published after the bill passed			1
" i 'll save a bundle of money every year			0
" " i suspect this is what most ' smart ' @entity10 will do , " he continued			0
" and then guess what ? insurance companies will collapse because they 'll have no pool of money to pay for the claims that start coming in , and we 'll be in a world of hurt again			0

but he also thinks the fight is far from over			0
" you know what 's going to happen now ... the insurance companies will begin to cut people who are sick as quickly as they can before the window of opportunity is over ... they 'll also increase premiums as the banks did after legislation was passed for credit card reform			2
" @entity128 , of @entity129 , @entity130 , says he 's in good health and feels like he does n't need health insurance			2
