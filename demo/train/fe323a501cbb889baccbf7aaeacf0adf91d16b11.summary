@entity0 , @entity1 -- a man serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore has confessed to overpowering and fatally shooting a deputy who was taking him to court wednesday , authorities said			1
@entity12 , 40 , was arrested outside a pawn shop in @entity0 , @entity1 , hours after the death of @entity11 deputy @entity10 sparked a massive manhunt			1
it was the third shooting of a @entity11 sheriff 's deputy in four months , and the second fatality			1
the incident happened as @entity12 was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a @entity24 bank , sheriff @entity18 said			1
@entity12 was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition , @entity18 said			1
the driver 's compartment of the van was separated from the back by a cage or grill			2
@entity12 and @entity10 left about 8:05 a.m. , @entity18 said			1
minutes later , a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near @entity36 called 911			2
" all of this transpired within six minutes			1
that 's all it took , " @entity18 said			0
the struggle began when @entity10 apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection			0
the deputy 's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger , bruises and cuts , @entity18 said			1
@entity12 allegedly took @entity10 's service weapon away from him and shot him , authorities said			1
although two shots were fired , @entity10 was shot only once , the bullet entering his upper chest and exiting his lower back , @entity18 told reporters			0
after the shooting , @entity12 is believed to have thrown @entity10 from the van and driven away			1
a city public works employee later spotted the blood - spattered van in @entity62 , @entity18 said			0
@entity12 , meanwhile , is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to @entity0 , about 20 miles away			2
he approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride			0
the man , who was headed to a second pawn shop , agreed			0
when the man arrived at the second pawn shop , he left @entity12 in the car and went inside , @entity18 said			2
as he was talking to the clerk , a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy 's shooting , and showed a picture of @entity12 , he said			1
the man " tells the clerk , ' hey , i have that guy in my car , ' " @entity18 said			0
he went back to the car , took his keys , came back and told the clerk to call police			0
@entity12 was arrested shortly afterward			2
@entity10 's gun was found with @entity12 in the man 's car , the sheriff said			1
@entity12 faces charges including first - degree murder and escape , @entity18 said			1
he was being interviewed by police wednesday afternoon and was to appear before a judge at some point , he said , and afterward would be transported to @entity96			0
because the shooting was " an emotionally charged event for all of us ... we feel it 's probably better that he be housed at another facility outside of @entity11 , " @entity18 said , and @entity96 agreed to house him			0
@entity12 initially was reluctant to talk to authorities , but later agreed , and confessed to shooting @entity10 , the sheriff said			1
@entity18 said @entity12 was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in @entity108 , correcting his earlier statement that @entity12 was serving two life sentences			2
he was on trial for robbery of the @entity24 bank			0
@entity11 also has a pending case against @entity12 -- a february drugstore robbery in @entity36 , he said			2
@entity12 was dressed in civilian clothes -- a suit -- rather than jail scrubs wednesday because he had a court date , authorities have said			1
when caught , however , @entity12 was wearing a t - shirt , shorts and sneakers , @entity18 told reporters			1
police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance and whether anyone helped him			0
@entity10 's co-workers told reporters he was " in outstanding condition physically			0
" the sheriff 's office has fitness - for - duty standards that deputies must meet			1
@entity11 deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates , @entity18 said			1
thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved , he said			0
" it 's a routine thing , " @entity18 said			0
" but it shows , in this profession , nothing is routine , whether it be a domestic , a traffic stop or just transporting an inmate to court			2
" as news of the escape broke , all 273 schools in @entity11 went on lockdown , according to @entity152 , a spokeswoman for the school system			0
@entity18 said @entity10 's wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot			2
" she said you never think it 's going to happen to you , " the sheriff said			2
the deputy was memorialized wednesday on the web site of the @entity162			0
