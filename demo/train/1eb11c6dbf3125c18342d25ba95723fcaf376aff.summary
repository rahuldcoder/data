-- voters in three states head to the polls tuesday , and in one of those states history might be made : @entity6 @entity6 @entity7 could make state rep. @entity8 their first female gubernatorial nominee			1
she 's in a runoff against @entity12 rep. @entity11			0
@entity8 just missed out on winning the nomination outright in the june 8 primary , capturing 49 percent of the vote in a four - candidate field			1
she was short of the 50 percent plus one needed to take the nomination			0
once facing long odds for the @entity7 nomination , @entity8 rose in the polls thanks in part to endorsements by former @entity24 gov. @entity23 and former @entity26 gov. @entity25			2
and unsubstantiated allegations by two other @entity7 that they had affairs with @entity8 , who is married with children , most likely helped rather than hurt her campaign			2
so did a racial slur by a @entity7 state lawmaker at @entity8 , who is @entity33 - @entity12 and was raised @entity34 , but became a @entity35 at age 24			1
" the unproven allegations and attacks against @entity8 actually played right into her message as a new kind of conservative , " said @entity0 political producer @entity37 , who is in @entity6 reporting on the campaign			2
" in fighting back , she was able to argue that establishment figures in the @entity7 were playing politics as usual and trying to stop a real reformer from taking charge in @entity48			0
" if @entity8 wins tuesday 's runoff , she 'll be considered the favorite in the general election against state sen. @entity52 , the @entity53 gubernatorial nominee			1
@entity8 would become the @entity56 state 's first woman governor if elected in november			2
there are also runoffs in @entity6 in contests for the @entity60 and for the state legislature			0
state rep. @entity62 hopes to become the first black @entity7 to win election to @entity64 from @entity6 in a century			1
he faces off against @entity65 , the son of the late sen. @entity66 , in a @entity68 primary runoff			0
@entity69 rep. @entity69 is hoping he wo n't become the third @entity60 incumbent to lose a bid for re-election so far this primary season			0
he grabbed 27 percent of the vote in the primary and now faces a runoff against @entity78 prosecutor @entity77			0
@entity69 is facing criticism for his vote in favor of the @entity82 , or @entity82 , better known as the @entity84 bailout			0
@entity85 in neighboring @entity85 , secretary of state @entity86 faces off in a @entity53 @entity88 primary runoff against former state sen. @entity89 , who was recruited by national @entity53			1
the winner will challenge @entity92 sen. @entity92 in november 's general election			1
" @entity92 does n't have the strongest poll numbers , but that may not matter , " said @entity94 , publisher and editor of the nonpartisan @entity94			0
@entity94 said neither of the @entity53 candidates " seems likely to put together the kind of campaign that would defeat @entity92			2
" voters in three congressional districts and one state @entity88 district also will cast ballots in runoff contests			2
@entity108 the fight for the @entity7 @entity88 nomination is capturing the spotlight in @entity108 , and the contest will be another test of the political strength of the @entity115			1
the national @entity115 group , which is based in @entity117 , is backing and assisting lawyer @entity118 in the battle to succeed fellow @entity7 @entity120 , who is supporting the other candidate on the ballot , businessman @entity122			1
@entity124 and @entity118 finished first and second , respectively last month at the @entity126 convention , advancing to tuesday 's primary			1
@entity124 and @entity118 touted themselves as more reliable conservatives than @entity120 , who finished third in the voting by delegates , eliminating him from advancing to the primary and ending his chances of re-election for a fourth term			1
@entity120 became the first sitting senator to go down to defeat in a primary season marked by strong anti-incumbent sentiment			0
the @entity115 , best known for its three national bus tours , is running radio ads supporting @entity118			0
the group recently pumped more than $ 500,000 into the recent fight for the @entity7 @entity88 nomination in @entity145 , helping transform ex-state lawmaker @entity146 , once considered a long shot , into an easy winner in this month 's primary election			1
@entity150 also has endorsed @entity118 , and its volunteers are assisting in get - out - the - vote efforts in @entity108			2
@entity150 is a nonprofit conservative organization that helps train volunteer activists and has provided much of the organizational heft behind the @entity115 movement			0
@entity120 upset many conservatives with his 2007 vote for president @entity159 's plan for a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants and his 2008 vote for the federal bailout of banks and financial institutions			0
the fiscally conservative @entity167 actively worked to defeat @entity120 , as did local @entity115 organizations and @entity115			0
the @entity7 dominates statewide elections in @entity108 , and the winner of the @entity7 primary will be considered the overwhelming favorite to win the general election in november .			1

state rep. @entity8 just missed an outright win in the june 8 primary
