-- a @entity2 hacker that prosecutors described as a " depraved criminal " was handed an 18 - year prison term tuesday for unleashing a vendetta of cyberterror that turned his neighbors ' lives into a living nightmare			1
@entity12 , 46 , repeatedly hacked into his next - door neighbors ' @entity13 in 2009 , and used it to try and frame them for child pornography , sexual harassment , various kinds of professional misconduct and to send threatening e-mail to politicians , including vice president @entity22			1
his motive was to get back at his new neighbors after they told the police he 'd kissed their 4 - year - old son on the lips			1
" @entity12 has demonstrated by his conduct that he is a dangerous man			1
when he became angry at his neighbors , he vented his anger in a bizarre and calculated campaign of terror against them , " prosecutor @entity30 said in a court filing			2
" and he did not wage this campaign in the light of day , but rather used his computer hacking skills to strike at his victims while hiding in the shadows			0
" over months and months , he inflicted unfathomable psychic damage , making the victims feel vulnerable in their own home , while avoiding detection			0
" @entity12 's attorney , @entity46 , said in a telephone interview that " it was a lengthy sentence for a first - time offender			1
" the defendant also forfeited his house and computer gear			0
@entity12 had no criminal record , but an investigation revealed that he 'd also hijacked the @entity13 of other neighbors , and terrorized them as well			1
a father of two , @entity12 had turned down a 2 - year plea agreement last year to charges related to the @entity22 e-mail			1
after that , the authorities piled on more charges , including identity theft and two kiddie - porn accusations carrying lifetime sex - offender registration requirements			2
he pleaded guilty to them all last year			0
the bizarre tale began in 2009 when @entity68 and @entity69 moved in the house next door to @entity12 , who at the time was a @entity74 computer technician living in the @entity76 suburb of @entity77			1
on their first day at their new home , the @entity69 's then - 4 - year - old son wandered near @entity12 's house			1
while carrying him back next door , @entity12 allegedly kissed the boy on the lips			1
" we 've just moved next door to a pedophile , " mrs. @entity69 told her husband			2
the couple reported @entity12 to the police , angering their creepy new neighbor			1
" i decided to ' get even ' by launching computer attacks against him , " @entity12 later wrote in a letter to the judge			1
@entity94 , the prosecutor , put it not so mildly : " it was apparently this incident which caused the defendant to begin a calculated campaign to terrorize his neighbors , doing whatever he could to destroy the careers and professional reputations of @entity68 and @entity69 , to damage the @entity105 ' marriage , and to generally wreak havoc on their lives , " he said			2
@entity12 downloaded @entity13 hacking software and spent two weeks cracking the @entity111 's @entity110 encryption			1
then he used their own @entity13 network to create a fake @entity114 page for the husband , where he posted a picture of a pubescent girl having sex with two young boys			1
under the " about me " section , he wrote : " i bet my coworker that since i 'm a lawyer and a darn great one that i could get away with putting up porn on my site here			0
i bet that all i have to do is say that there is plausible deniability since anybody could have put this on my site			0
like someone hacked my page and added porn without my knowledge			2
i 'm a darn good lawyer and i can get away with doing anything ! " he then e-mailed the same child porn to one of the husband 's co-workers , and sent flirtatious e-mail to women in mr. @entity144 's office			0
" you are such a fox , " read one of the e-mails			0
he sent the message 's through the husband 's genuine e-mail account			0
after the husband explained to his law office superiors that he had no idea what was happening , his bosses hired a law firm that examined his network and discovered that an " unknown " device had access to it			0
with @entity69 's permission , they installed a packet sniffer on his network to try and get to the bottom of the incidents			0
then , in may 2009 , the @entity165 showed up at @entity69 's office to ask about several threatening e-mails sent from his @entity168 account , and traced to his ip address , that were addressed to @entity22 and other politicians			2
the subject line of one e-mail read : " this is a terrorist threat ! take this seriously			0
" " i swear to @entity176 i 'm going to kill you ! , " part of the message to @entity22 said			0
a forensics computer investigator working for @entity69 's law firm examined the packet logs , and found the e-mail sessions sending the threats			0
in the data surrounding the threatening traffic , they found traffic containing @entity12 's name and @entity189 account			1
the @entity190 got a search warrant for @entity12 's house and computer , and found reams of evidence , including copies of data swiped from the @entity105 ' computer , and hacking manuals with titles such as cracking wep using @entity201 : a beginner 's guide ; tutorial : simple @entity205 and cracking @entity110 with @entity201 3 -- step - by - step instructions			1
they also found handwritten notes laying out @entity12 's revenge plans , and a cache of postal mail that @entity212 had apparently stolen from the @entity214 ' mailbox and stashed under his bed			2
" one of the manuals had @entity12 's handwriting on it and another had the unique identifying @entity220 for the @entity105 ' router typed into it , " @entity30 , the prosector , wrote			2
also discovered in @entity12 's possession was the pornographic image posted on @entity114 and sent to the husband 's co-worker , and evidence that he 'd secretly staged a similar harassment campaign against a neighbor at @entity12 's previous home in @entity230 , another @entity76 suburb			1
among other things , he sent that family a postal - mail message consisting of a one - page , color print - out of the family 's " @entity238 " return with personally identifying information , in addition to several skull images			0
" i told you about a year ago that you should be very afraid			0
i can destroy you at will , you sorry - ass excuse for a human , " the letter said			0
the @entity230 family told the @entity190 they believed @entity12 was upset that their personal care attendants , who looked after their two disabled twin daughters , parked their car in front of his house			2
