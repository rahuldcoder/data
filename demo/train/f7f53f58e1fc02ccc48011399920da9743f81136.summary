-- during the civil rights era , @entity2 gov. @entity1 was asked by a supporter why he was fixated on the politics of race			0
@entity1 replied , " you know , i tried to talk about good roads and good schools and all these things that have been part of my career , and nobody listened			0
and then i began talking about n * ggers , and they stomped the floor			0
" in the 1980s , during the rise of the gay rights movement , @entity18 sen. @entity17 accused a political opponent for supporting " f * ggots , perverts [ and ] sexual deviates of this nation			0
" today , opponents of immigration reform attack undocumented immigrants as " illegal immigrants			1
" even worse , like anti-immigration extremists , some prominent elected officials use the term " illegals			1
" @entity35 gov. @entity34 , a @entity36 , said , " i urge all @entity37 to tell your city councilors and selectmen to stop handing out your money to illegals			1
" not the same thing ? of course it is			0
once upon a time , the n - word and f - word were utterly acceptable terminology in undermining not only the basic rights but basic humanity of black people and gay people			1
that those terms seem radically inappropriate and out of step with mainstream culture now is only because social movements and legal and political changes have shifted the landscape			0
but make no mistake about it , words matter , not only in reflecting certain dehumanizing attitudes toward historically marginalized groups but in actively perpetuating and rationalizing that dehumanization			1
even now , as some people go to courts to suppress the ability of women to make decisions about their own bodies and contraceptive choices , women who stand up for reproductive freedom are being called " sluts " and " whores			1
" recently , i watched the stunning film , " documented , " on @entity0 and posted my reactions on @entity78			1
the responses i got were mostly positive but some conservatives took issue with me			0
for instance , someone tweeted at me : " how about you donate 100 % of your $ to help poor @entity86 children & not illegals " -- as though @entity86 kids are worthy and deserving and undocumented immigrant kids are not			1
' i did n't know i was undocumented ' another tweeted : " stop disease from coming into the @entity86			0
build the wall ! " -- again , not a humane reaction but an us - versus - them mindset that reduces immigrants to a public health threat			2
when i tweeted that i was " consistently troubled by [ the ] number of people who seem to feel more compassion toward puppies on the internet than undocumented humans , " among the many blistering replies i received was , " do the internet puppies have scabies ... ? " other responses compared undocumented immigrants to " invaders " and " child abusers			1
" come on , people			2
is it not possible to oppose immigrant rights without resorting to attacking immigrants as human beings ? the intensity of the anti-immigrant rhetoric is stunning			0
even if you do n't support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants , ca n't you find some compassion for them as human beings who live on the same planet ? after all , whether you think our immigration laws are properly functioning or not , the forces of economic hardship and violence that push people to leave their home countries and the promise of a better future in @entity86 that pulls people here are the same forces that pushed and pulled on many of our ancestors			1
protesters block buses carrying undocumented immigrants in @entity140 plus we know that @entity86 industries that rely on low - wage workers and actively lure undocumented immigrants to our country sometimes offer promises of official paperwork that never materialize			2
the organization race forward has a campaign to get media organizations to " @entity150 " in their reporting about immigration			2
so far , the campaign has succeeded in getting the @entity153 , @entity154 , the @entity155 and many other outlets to stop using the word			2
but the pressure continues on the @entity159 , the @entity160 and radio and television outlets			0
and the campaign around media usage is just one step toward influencing and ultimately ending the use of the word " illegal " by everyone in @entity86			2
@entity169 : undocumented and hiding in plain sight as the rev. @entity174 once said , " the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice			0
" the history of the @entity86 that anti-immigration activists profess to defend is one perpetually defined by inclusion rather than exclusion			0
our notion of our nation expanded over time to include black people and women and gay people and others who were most marginalized previously			1
as we celebrate the signing of the 1964 @entity187 50 years ago this month , we 're reminded of protests in the lead up to that moment in which black men carried signs that simply read , " i am a man			0
" and as we look back on the 45th anniversary of the landmark gay liberation protests set off at the @entity197 in @entity198 , we remember protests where gay men and lesbians carried signs that simply said , " gay is good			0
" today , most people find the n - word and the f - word incredibly offensive			1
let 's hope that most if not all people will feel the same way about the words " illegals " and " illegal immigrants " in the not too distant future .			1

the film " documented " airs 9 p.m. et *saturday* , july 5 , on @entity0
@entity217 : the n - word and f - word are considered *bad* , but what about " illegals ? "
@entity217 : some words reflect our dehumanizing attitude toward marginalized people
she says despite heated *debates* over immigration , people should have compassion
