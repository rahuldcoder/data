-- moderate @entity1 has gathered support from the left and the right since he was ousted from the @entity5 over his decision to run for the @entity8 presidency			1
now running as a respected independent in @entity8 's first democratic presidential election , @entity1 says the pillars of his program are to strengthen democracy , freedom and respect for human rights , and to ensure everyone is treated fairly under @entity8 law			1
those ideals are backed by a long history of opposition to the regime of president @entity23 , said dr. @entity24 , director of @entity25 at the @entity26 and a visiting scholar at the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30			1
@entity1 was among those who first demonstrated in @entity32 on january 25 , 2011 , @entity24 told @entity0 from @entity33 , and he has maintained his commitment to the popular revolution since			1
he is now winning support from people from across the political spectrum , from far right , ultraconservative groups all the way to revolutionaries , @entity24 said			0
" what brings them together , all these very different groups , is this will for changing the status quo and ( an ) understanding that the current civil - military relationship is very much skewed , with too much power in the hands of the military , " @entity24 said			0
@entity1 has also shown he can stand tough when he needs to , which suggests he will stick to his campaign promises , @entity24 said			1
among those promises are a determination to tackle the corruption that permeates @entity8 society and to restore the independence of the judiciary			1
he has also pledged to bring to justice those responsible for killing protesters involved in the demonstrations of the past year , @entity24 said			0
a poll published this month by the @entity65 showed @entity1 placing second behind rival @entity66 , and suggested he did particularly well among more educated voters			2
starting wednesday , @entity8 will head to the polls for the historic election			2
in an interview with the @entity73 - focused magazine @entity72 , posted on his official website , @entity1 talks about the need for @entity8 's new president to be " flexible on issues of religion " and able to " maintain the country 's safety and independence			1
" his own strength as a candidate is rooted in his four decades in public and political life , he said			0
after becoming politically active while a medical student in the 1960s , @entity1 continued his political engagement through the following decades			2
he was arrested twice for his involvement with the @entity5 , in 1981 and again in 1996 , when he was detained for five years			2
he was jailed again in 2009 , this time for six months , for his part in efforts by the @entity93 doctors ' @entity91 for @entity94 to take medicines into the @entity94			0
an internal reformer , he had already planned to leave the @entity5 before the group suspended him last year , he told @entity72 , because he felt it should focus on its social and educational activities rather than a political role			1
while his relations with the @entity5 remain bad , that break with the organization is part of his very broad appeal , said @entity106 , a visiting fellow at the @entity28 in @entity107			2
@entity1 's " big - picture " thinking , moving beyond the tension between the religious and secular to the country 's future , has proved popular with young people and secular revolutionary types , @entity106 said			0
he also holds slightly more liberal views on social issues than most in the @entity5			0
at the same time , @entity118 appeals to the ultraconservative @entity120 groups on political grounds because he is no longer part of the @entity5 but is still an @entity123 , rather than secular , contender			1
" the @entity120 see the @entity5 as a threat to them not only because they are both competing for @entity123 constituencies , but as a broader threat as a potential monopolizer of the political process , " @entity106 said			1
" the @entity5 do n't like to share the ball			0
" as a result , the @entity120 are willing to overlook their ideological and philosophical differences with @entity118 and back him			0
many liberals also see him as a more viable candidate than some of the revolutionary leftists , @entity106 said , and so are rallying behind the independent as the " least worst option " for them			0
" he has been very critical of @entity8 's military rulers , so he is seen as someone who is acceptable but can still shake things up , " @entity106 said			0
when it comes to the ballot box , @entity1 's success may depend on how widely the revolutionary or liberal vote is split , with other candidates such as @entity149 also appealing to that constituency			0
but he has made clear that he is a champion of peaceful change and wants to see @entity8 's revolution continue on a true path toward democracy .			1
