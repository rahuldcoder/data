-- the adage says " a picture is worth a thousand words , " but when @entity3 happened upon a photograph of her late mother on @entity6 after her home was destroyed in @entity8 , she was speechless			1
" the first thing i see on my timeline is my mother holding my daughter , @entity15 , on the day that she was born			2
i 'm usually a very cheery person , but i absolutely crumbled , " said @entity3 , a 47 - year - old elementary school teacher and mother of twin 14 - year - old girls from @entity18 , @entity19			2
@entity18 is a small seaside community with fewer than 6,500 residents , and @entity8 hit it hard , destroying nearly 200 homes and decimating the coastline			1
" it was kind of like ' @entity26 , ' " said resident @entity24			2
a hot tub was found a block and a half away from where it once sat. remnants of wooden decks floated in the tide			0
family photo albums were buried under piles where multistory houses once stood			1
powerless in @entity19 @entity38 @entity39 also lost her @entity18 home in @entity8 , but buried among the devastation she found a calling -- to return memories of happier times to the 1.8 - square - mile township by reuniting residents with the family photographs that @entity8 scattered to the winds			1
the day after the storm , @entity49 went for a walk along the shoreline to assess the damage and she stumbled upon a photograph of a couple attending a wedding			1
she leaned down , picked it up and , suddenly , her mission became clear			0
" photos are the only things that hold us to the past			1
my niece was murdered in 2008 and the only thing we have left of her is our photos , " said @entity49			1
she soon started a @entity6 page where she uploaded the pictures she found , hopeful that through the power of social media , residents of the small community would see them and be able to identify the faces and families in the photographs			1
since she started , @entity49 has uploaded more than 2,000 photos to the @entity6 page -- and she 's still looking each day for more lost memories among the debris			1
about 60 families have reclaimed photos so far , she said			1
and some people , like @entity3 and her daughters , have since joined the effort			2

" my mother , very much like myself , hated having her picture taken			0
that day , i did n't see anything but a picture of my mother holding my baby			0
i even posted ' today is going to be a good day			0
' it 's such a gift , " said @entity3			0
@entity24 , who also lost her home , found baby photos of her now grown children on @entity49 's facebook page			1
" you hold your memories in your heart , but yet to be able to look back , it 's amazing , " she said			0
" my husband 's parents are both gone and we had a picture of both of them in our living room			0
we do n't have them anymore			0
it 's nice that somebody 's out there trying to find your memories and give them back to you			0
" paying it forward , @entity24 has also begun to take photos she finds to the police station to be uploaded to the online forum			2

volunteers can help you get food , get shelter , get clothing , but in the end , if no one thinks of picking up the photos or the objects that were miles from where they were supposed to be , people do n't feel whole , " said @entity49			1
as more communities that were ordered to evacuate are allowed to re-enter their neighborhoods , similar initiatives have begun to pop up along the badly beaten @entity140			2
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity145 @entity146 recently started the for @entity147 , which asks residents and cleanup volunteers to collect photographs that were strewn about in the storm surge			1
@entity146 lives in @entity152 now , but she grew up in @entity153 , @entity19 , where her parents still live			0
her childhood home was luckily left unscathed , but in the backyard , she found kitchen cabinets , books , even a little boy 's football helmet signed by the actor and former football player @entity162			0
and , of course , photographs			2
" i grew up with sand in my pants in my whole life , " she said			0
" it 's that moment where you sit back and think these could be my pictures			0
" for those without photo scanners , @entity171 has teamed up with local @entity19 businesses like @entity176 's specialty food stores in @entity177 and @entity178 as drop - off locations for lost - and - found photos that are then collected and uploaded to the for @entity181			1
" photography is so common and ubiquitous that we take it for granted , and we do n't realize how important it is to us , " said @entity182 , who heads the general studies program at the @entity184			1
" it 's the despair of losing part of yourself			0
your very memories are being taken away from you			0
" @entity192 , a photographer who studied psychology at @entity194 and runs the blog " @entity196 , " agrees			0
" we as humans become habituated to our environment			0
we forget the way that grandma 's house looked			0
when you find a photo that shows those things that you are habituated to and you forgot , it brings back all those memories that you forgot to stop and remember , " she said			2
when @entity212 devastated the @entity213 in 2005 , @entity209 of @entity210 , @entity211 , also recognized the power of photography and started @entity216			1
after seeing a reporter on television hold up a picture that was found in the middle of the street of a child in a dance costume , @entity209 had a revelation similar to @entity49 's			1
" then it hit me -- many families on the @entity213 had lost their entire history in family photos due to @entity212 and i should do something about it , " she said			1
partnering with @entity231 , the @entity232 and @entity233 , among others , @entity216 was able to return thousands of photos to their rightful owners			2
@entity209 's revelation also came about because of the coffee table book " @entity239 : eyes from the @entity241 of @entity242 , " which sat in front of her during the news report			0
@entity209 had attended a presentation at the @entity247 by the book 's author , @entity248 , several years prior			0
during a tour of the @entity242 concentration camp in 1986 , @entity248 discovered an archive of more than 2,000 photographs confiscated from @entity255 families at the death camp			1
trying to keep the family business afloat after @entity8 " they wanted to bring their emblem of who they were , and they wanted to remember the lives that they lived and the people that they loved			1
or even , just remember the people they themselves once were , " said @entity248			2
@entity248 fought red tape to obtain the pictures and after doing so , traveled around the world tracking down any survivors , family members and friends that they might belong to			0
being stripped of family memories in the holocaust is very different from losing belongings in a natural disaster , @entity248 pointed out , but the end result of both is profound loss			0
" i think all photos are incredibly important because photos are the emblem of our lives			2
they 're tangible proof that we lived , that we 're here and when there 's a natural disaster -- after the people and after the pets -- what 's the first thing we want to save ? it 's always the pictures , " she said			2
" pictures encapsulate our lives , our dreams , our essence of who we are			0
" like @entity303 on @entity6			1

@entity39 is trying to reunite @entity8 victims with lost photographs
@entity49 uploads 2,000 photos to @entity6 , hoping people will recognize them
similar photo reunion projects were started for @entity212 and the @entity275
