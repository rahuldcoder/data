@entity0 -- former " @entity3 " actress @entity2 returns to the stand friday in her legal battle with show creator @entity6 and @entity7 over the tv killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons			1
during thursday 's court session , @entity2 , 48 , slapped her lawyer to demonstrate how she claims @entity6 hit her during a rehearsal			1
her wrongful termination lawsuit contends @entity6 killed off @entity18 , the sassy , blond woman @entity2 played , in retaliation for her complaints about being hit			1
several of @entity2 's former castmates -- including @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 -- are on the list of witnesses expected to defend @entity6 during the two - week - long @entity0 trial			1
@entity6 's lawyers contend show writers began planning @entity18 's demise in may 2008 , four months before the alleged battery , as a way to shock viewers and raise ratings			1
the hit was just " a light tap on the head " intended to demonstrate " a piece of physical humor " @entity6 wanted @entity2 to perform , the defense said in opening statements wednesday			1
@entity2 's dissatisfaction with her lack of lines in a scene preceded the alleged hitting incident , she testified			2
she wanted to recite a line from a @entity52 song -- " she loves you , yeah , yeah , yeah " -- but @entity6 said the music royalties would be too expensive			2
without it , her exit from the scene " was n't funny anymore , " @entity2 testified			0
@entity2 testified that while she explained her concerns to @entity6 , the producer asked " what is it that you want ? " then he hit her his open right hand , she said			1
" it was a nice wallop to my head			0
" " it was shocking , humiliating , it was demeaning , " she said			2
@entity2 demonstrated the hit in slow motion on her lawyer , @entity72 , but then he asked her to " hit me as hard as you were hit			1
" " i do n't want to hurt you , " @entity2 told her lawyer			2
the actress finally agreed to show jurors the hit in full force , sending a loud thump across the courtroom and turning @entity72 's head			1
" i 'm fine , " he assured her as she apologized			0
@entity6 apologized to her soon after the hitting incident , telling her " i am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness , " @entity2 testified			1
but she did not accept it			0
the next day , she told show producer @entity89 she wanted a second apology and flowers from @entity6			1
" i thought he could , at least , apologize again and send me flowers , " she said			0
but @entity6 's reply , delivered by @entity89 , was not a second apology or flowers			1
" he felt the incident had been resolved , " @entity2 said he told her			0
five months and 11 episodes later , @entity6 informed @entity2 that @entity18 would die during a show taping the next day , ending her five - year run on " @entity3			1
" jurors must decide if the death of @entity2 's character and the end of her employment was illegal workplace retaliation or just a creative decision unconnected to the alleged battery incident			2
@entity6 's defense is expected to present notes made by show writers in may 2008 that document the various scenarios they were considering at the time for killing off @entity18			1
in his opening statement wednesday , @entity114 , @entity2 's lawyer , challenged the authenticity of those writers notes , accusing @entity6 's defense of an " effort to backdate the decision " with a fake story that the character 's death was planned months before the hitting incident			1
@entity18 is " a very colorful character , sassy , overt , audacious , " @entity2 said			0
" she has a heart , but people loved to hate her			0
" she made it clear to jurors she was not like the character she played			0
" i think honesty is about the only thing we shared			0
" jurors appeared to enjoy several clips of the show , featuring her character seducing a series of men			0
they laughed several times during the playing of the clips			0
they were also shown @entity18 's death scene , in which she crashed a car into a tree and was electrocuted by a fallen power line			0
@entity6 lawyer defense lawyer @entity148 told jurors that tv writers must " shock and surprise " viewers with pregnancies , affairs , marriages , divorces and deaths to " keep them on the edge of their seats			1
" " the unanticipated death of a prominent character can shock the viewing audience and energize the show , " which @entity148 said can " lead to watercooler talk and media buzz , " increasing ratings			0
the demise of @entity2 's character was first considered at the end of the third season , which ended with @entity18 's head in a hangman 's noose , but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go , @entity148 said			1
@entity2 testified that the hangman 's noose scene was @entity6 's idea , prompted by @entity7 's request that the season end with something " more spectacular			1
" @entity6 assured her that her character would " be saved " in the next episode at the start of season four , she said			0
she said @entity6 even told the whole cast when they gathered to start the next season 's production that " we know one character we wo n't be killing off is @entity18 , " because people were " up in arms " over the possibility			2
the character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode , but @entity6 decided to make her the " blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives , " he said			2
after five seasons , " writers could only do so much with the character , " @entity148 said			0
" there were only so many husbands she could sleep with			0
" @entity210 is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate @entity2 's accusation that @entity6 hit her and then agreed with his decision to fire her			1
although a line producer reported the incident to the studio 's human resources department , there was no investigation until an @entity7 senior executive saw a @entity224 story about it at a grocery store two months later , @entity114 said			0
what followed was a " fake " investigation designed " to protect the money machine known as ' @entity3 , ' " he said			0
" nobody wants the ' @entity3 ' applecart turned upside down			0
" the human resources investigator never interviewed @entity6 or @entity2 about the incident , only three people who worked for @entity6 , @entity114 said			2
contracts introduced during @entity2 's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show , even for the last three seasons after her termination .			2

@entity2 returns to the witness stand friday in her case against producer @entity6
her lawyer asks @entity2 to show on him in full force how she says @entity6 hit her on " @entity3 " set
" it was shocking , humiliating , it was demeaning , " she said .
it was " a light tap on the head " to demonstrate " physical humor , " @entity6 's lawyer says
