-- in true finale form , this week 's testimony was emotional , drama - filled and , thanks in part to a spectator who made an obscene gesture at prosecutor @entity7 , not without a few surprises			0
even the weather set the tone , storming so loudly on friday that the thunder could be heard inside the courtroom			0
after 33 days and more than 100 witnesses , the murder trial of @entity14 is inches from its end -- only sunday 's closing statements remain before the jury deliberates			1
on thursday , the defense wrapped up its case after calling to the stand every member of the @entity25 family this week except for @entity26			1
she only made a cameo when she personally addressed the judge to answer one of the trial 's biggest questions -- whether she would testify			2
she declined the opportunity to testify in her defense			0
prosecutors allege that @entity25 , 25 , killed her daughter @entity14 in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform , putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate , or a combination of the two acts			1
they also allege that @entity25 stored the body in the trunk of her car for days before dumping it in the woods			1
@entity25 faces seven counts , including first - degree murder , in the death of @entity14 , whose remains were discovered in a wooded field in december 2008			1
if convicted , she could face the death penalty			0
@entity25 pleaded not guilty , and her defense team asserts @entity14 accidentally drowned in a pool in june 2008 at the @entity57 home that @entity25 shared with her parents			1
the defense team has argued that @entity25 and her father , @entity25 , panicked on discovering the body and covered up her death , though @entity25 has denied that scenario			1
@entity14 was not reported missing to police until july 15 , 2008 -- 31 days after she was last seen alive			1
@entity26 's father , @entity25 , was a key player in the defense 's final testimony , taking the stand twice during the final week			1
on tuesday , he denied an affair with @entity70 , a one - time volunteer in the search to find @entity14 and the woman who claims @entity25 told her @entity14 's death was an accident			1
@entity25 said his relationship with @entity70 was platonic , and he only visited her apartment because she told him she had a brain tumor and needed someone to comfort her			2
@entity70 testified the following day , retelling a conversation she alleges she had with @entity25			2
" he said it was an accident that snowballed out of control , " @entity70 said			0
" but i was caught off guard with it and by the time i looked up he had tears in his eyes , and i did n't say anything after that			0
" @entity70 stood by her version of the conversation even when @entity7 , the prosecutor , confronted her with the differing statement she gave to police			0
she told police @entity95 said , " i really believe that it was an accident , and it just went wrong and she tried to cover it up			0
" on wednesday , questioning of @entity25 turned combative when lead defense attorney @entity100 suggested he feigned support for @entity26 in jailhouse conversations while pointing the finger at her behind her back			1
@entity25 admitted he pulled @entity57 detective @entity105 aside on july 15 , 2008 , the first night law enforcement visited the @entity25 home			2
he admitted he told @entity105 the car smelled like decomposition and that his daughter was lying			0
" @entity26 was the last one that i saw with @entity14 , " he responded angrily to @entity100			2
" one and one adds up to two , sir , in my mind , and no matter how you 're trying to spin it i 'm upset because my granddaughter is missing			0
" wednesday also brought @entity25 's second denial of accusations that he molested his daughter as she was growing up , and a full breakdown when he recalled the day @entity14 's remains were found			1
" [ i felt ] a deep hurt inside , tears , the whole gambit of such an emotional loss , seeing what my wife went through , what my son went through , " he said through sobs			0
the defense also suggested wednesday that @entity25 attempted to take his own life in a hotel room in 2009 because he was overcome with guilt			1
he admitted he consumed a mixture of pills and alcohol because he " wanted to be with @entity14			2
" in rebuttal , the state introduced into evidence @entity25 's eight - page suicide note , full of praise for his wife , longing for @entity14 and lots of outstanding questions			1
" i sit here falling apart , because i should have done more , " he wrote			0
" she was so close to home , why was she there ? who placed her there ? why is she gone ? why ? " prosecutors argue these questions about her death prove @entity25 did not know how @entity14 died , contradicting the defense 's allegations that @entity14 drowned and he helped cover it up			1
in the note , @entity25 also seems to express uncertainty about @entity26			2
he closes the letter by saying , " @entity155 ... caylee here i come ... @entity156 , i am sorry ... @entity26 -- " in a move the defense hoped would highlight the @entity161 's dysfunction , the defense called @entity14 , who during direct examination agreed she testified six months ago that she thought @entity14 was still alive			1
" there was still a part of me that believed @entity14 was alive at that time , " she said wednesday			2
@entity14 also played a role in the defense 's unexpected final line of questioning -- the manner in which they buried their family pets over the past two decades			1
during testimony from @entity95 , @entity176 and @entity177 , the defense suggested @entity14 was disposed of in the same way the family buried their pets , wrapped in a blanket and placed in garbage bags secured with duct tape			1
during cross examination , prosecutors pointed out that @entity14 was also privy to the family 's burial techniques			2
the defendant was in high school when their last pet died			0
highlights of the week also included testimony from @entity25 's former fiance , which the jury will never hear			1
with the jury out of the room , @entity197 testified that @entity25 told him she was molested by her brother			1
" she told me at one point in recent years that she woke up one night with @entity156 standing over her in bed asleep , " @entity197 said outside the jury 's presence			0
" and in another instance was groping her in the middle of the night			0
" judge @entity209 ruled the testimony was hearsay , and it was not admitted			0
@entity211 , the meter reader who discovered @entity14 's body , also took the stand this week			2
@entity100 alleged in opening statements that @entity211 is a " morally bankrupt person who took @entity14 's body and hid it			2
" @entity211 denied moving the body or touching it before december of 2008 , saying he spotted what he thought was a skull in august of 2008			0
after several unsuccessful attempts to direct police to what he thought could be the remains , he left the matter alone until december when he returned to the same area			0
" i still did n't think it [ the skull ] was real so i very gently took it [ the meter stick ] and put it into the right eye socket and i gently picked it up , " @entity211 said describing the moments before he called police			0
" i looked down and i realized what it was and i set it down as gently as i could			0
" the week came to a close friday with the state 's rebuttal			0
witnesses included @entity14 's former supervisor , who testified company records show @entity14 was at work during the times the defendant 's mother claims she was searching for " chlorophyll " on the family computer			1
earlier , a computer forensics expert had testified that he found searches for " chloroform " among the computer 's deleted files , but no searches for " chlorophyll			0
" @entity255 will resume sunday with closing arguments			1
the jury is expected to begin deliberations sunday evening			1
watch @entity259 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity260			0
