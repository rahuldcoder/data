-- @entity0 asked a @entity1 , @entity2 , and a @entity3 , @entity4 , to offer advice to the opposing party 's candidate for monday 's final presidential debate			1
@entity4 's advice for president @entity10 be prepared to answer one question : why , for almost two weeks after the attacks on the consulate in @entity16 , @entity17 , did your administration give the @entity19 people the impression that the attack was part of a spontaneous protest over an offensive video ? this is not criticism veiled as advice			1
monday night 's debate will largely focus on foreign policy			2
if that question is not asked , it will be journalistic malpractice by moderator @entity32 and debate malpractice by @entity34			1
5 things to watch in tonight 's debate malpractice is exactly what @entity34 committed in the last debate by bickering over whether the word " terrorism " was uttered in the @entity43			1
who cares what happened in the @entity43 ? the picture that @entity47 and @entity48 painted was clear and wrong			0
there was no protest over a video			0
there was no protest at all			0
it could be that initial intelligence wrongly suggested it was a spontaneous attack in response to a video and that even now the nature of the attack is n't fully clear , as the @entity60 reported on friday			2
but within hours of the attack there were contradictory reports			2
and as reported by @entity66 's @entity65 , those initial reports were soon put in doubt			0
whatever the answer , @entity10 should expect the question to be asked , and respond not with outrage , but accountability			1
get instant updates with @entity0 's live blog @entity34 will try to draw clear distinctions over how he would handle @entity75 , @entity76 , and @entity77			1
most of his criticism will revolve around rhetoric			0
the theme : @entity34 will be strong , @entity10 weak			1
on this @entity34 runs the risk of looking petty in questioning the burdens and respect that accompany the title commander in chief			1
but this one question is about truth and accountability			0
@entity10 will need an answer			1
and it will be asked			0
oh yeah , mention @entity93 at some point too			1
13 reasons to watch the last debate on @entity0 's platforms and nowhere else @entity2 's advice for @entity34 a debate on foreign policy for most @entity19 is , let 's face it , like eating your peas			1
you know it matters , but you just ca n't get too excited about about it			0
in a way , perhaps that is as it should be			0
if @entity19 felt their safety was particularly threatened by global events , people would be much more engaged in the policy discussion that will take place monday night			2
of course there are grave issues many parts of the world : the seemingly never - ending threat to @entity129 from @entity75 and others , @entity131 , trade deficits with @entity77 , a weak economy in @entity118 , and pockets of anti-western terrorism in many parts of the @entity122 and @entity123			0
and the @entity19 has much at stake in the outcomes of them or in shaping the ongoing crises			2
but the reality is also that we have spent billions of dollars in two wars over the last 12 years , and president @entity10 has kept his promise to bring those wars to an end and to focus his effort on keeping @entity19 safe			1
@entity0 / @entity143 : ads , money and travel so how does @entity34 get an edge over the president in a foreign policy debate ? my view is that he must simply look like a commander in chief for the future			1
in an effort to distinguish himself from @entity10 , @entity34 has made some big mistakes with regard to foreign policy			1
@entity34 's biggest mistake may simply be in his attitude			2
in short , he acts like a leader from the 1950s who is still trying to prove to the world that @entity19 is not just the best country , but the boss of the world			2
and in 2012 , that just does n't fly			0
are we the leader of the free world ? yes			0
are we a nation that should continue to share our democratic values with the world ? yes			0
can we control everything that happens in the world ? no -- and we should n't try			0
simply put , we ca n't afford it and we do n't need to			0
so when @entity34 blusters on about how much tougher he would be than @entity10 , in an effort to distinguish a foreign policy that is n't very distinguishable , he should pay careful attention to the fact that were he to be president , acting so aggressively would carry expectations that he follow through			1
and the @entity19 people do not want a president who picks fights around the world			2
my advice to @entity34 is to " chill " a little in the debate			1
do n't act like you will be the world 's bully			2
act thoughtful and well , presidential -- like our actual president			0
how foreign policy hits close to home the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity3 @entity4 to @entity10 : *explain* in detail the attack in @entity16 , @entity17
@entity4 : of course , @entity10 should point to *killing* of @entity93
democrat @entity2 : @entity34 must behave like a commander in chief
@entity2 : he should " chill " on aggressive stances or risk making @entity19 seem like a bully
