-- when it comes to its creature design , " @entity4 " opts for a less - is - more approach			1
unfortunately , in this case , less is just less			2
rather than any @entity11 monstrosities or the insectoid extraterrestrials of the @entity14 canon , the space invaders of this surprisingly thrill-less @entity9 - set thriller are invisible for much of the film			1
when you can see them , they resemble nothing more exciting than floating @entity21 screensavers			2
by the time these glowing gyros drift down from the night sky like fluff blown off of some cosmic dandelion , we 've already been introduced to our gang of would - be survivors and have pretty much figured out in what order they 're going to die			1
not that we 'll be too upset , as it 's clear from early on that these characters are as indistinct and lazily rendered as the floating blobs chasing them			1
the core crew is thus : two @entity36 entrepreneurial hopefuls ( @entity37 and @entity38 ) , a craven and duplicitous @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , and two female friends on vacation ( @entity43 and @entity44 ) , now navigating the @entity46 capital after much of its population has been reduced to ash			2
the aliens disintegrate any humans they touch , like the tripods of 2005 's " @entity53			1
" but where @entity55 evoked muted horror from the victims ' cindered remains , you get the feeling that " @entity4 " director @entity61 and screenwriter @entity62 just do it because it looks cool			0
they do manage to eke out some fleeting dread when the creatures ' electrical fields turn a row of flickering streetlamps into a tense , signaled approach			0
but when the script switches genres , exchanging survival horror for resistance fighting , it loses whatever momentum it had , and you 're left with a battle between two sides , neither of which are particularly interesting			1
you should be rooting for the humans , but you might as well be rooting for the blobs			0
most likely , though , you 'll just be rooting for the credits			0
