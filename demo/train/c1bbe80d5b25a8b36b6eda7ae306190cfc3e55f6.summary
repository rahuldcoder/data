-- @entity1 is beginning to resemble the eurozone -- a case of sport imitating economics			1
it may be early days at the quadrennial football tournament that fixates tens of millions of @entity8 from the @entity9 to the @entity10 , but there are worrying signs that some teams are mimicking national roles in the evolving @entity16 crisis			1
the evidence so far : @entity18 have been austere and unforgiving compared to their expansive play in the last @entity21			2
one can almost hear chancellor @entity23 in the locker room wagging her finger and demanding : " do n't give anything away			0
" against @entity28 they did n't , eking out victory with a utilitarian efficiency that echoes @entity18 leadership on the @entity8 stage			1
speaking of @entity28 , they may yet wake up in time to reach the next stage of the tournament , but like the other @entity8 bail - out countries they looked uncertain and have a lot of work to do to stay in the eurozone @entity1			1
@entity40 stun @entity41 as @entity18 beat @entity28 @entity42 , another country that had to seek help from the @entity45 and @entity46 , were humbled by @entity47 in their first game			1
perhaps @entity8 's center of economic gravity is , as some have speculated , shifting eastward -- if not its sense of humor			2
some @entity42 fans held aloft a banner proclaiming : " @entity56 thinks we 're working			0
" there was a bad start for another of the bail - out nations			1
after games against @entity63 and the @entity64 , @entity61 had amassed just one point ( if only their interest rates were the same , rather than 29 % on the 10 - year bond			0
) they had one player red - carded ( an omen for a disorderly exit from the eurozone ? ) and their defensive formation was less than convincing -- vulnerable to attacks from the left - and right - wings			2
new @entity61 woes at @entity1 @entity81 and @entity82 -- the two countries that might be most affected by the contagion of a disorderly @entity61 exit ( from the eurozone rather than from @entity1 ) -- played out a somewhat cautious 1 - 1 draw in their opening match			1
maybe they were thinking that one day they might need each other in asking for help from @entity8 and in arguing for more growth - oriented policies			1
a cut - away in the tv coverage of the match of an @entity98 and @entity99 fan kissing gave it all away			0
@entity101 rescues point for @entity81 apparently some investment analysts have also sought light relief from their day jobs in predicting the winners and losers at @entity1 , using all those sophisticated computer models that have served us so well in the past few years			2
researchers at @entity41 bank @entity111 justified time on the project by saying " football is the most important of all unimportant things			1
" which is plainly ridiculous , as most people know it 's not just a game but a way of life			0
anyway , @entity111 compared countries ' footballing pedigree with their credit - rating , and ( surprise ) concluded @entity18 would lift the trophy on july 1			1
they also said that as the euro crisis is largely one of confidence , " we believe it would be best if one of the eurozone countries won @entity1			1
a victory for one of the opt - out countries ( @entity40 , @entity135 , @entity136 ) would not be welcome because it would only encourage the eurosceptics			2
" who will win @entity1 ? this is just the sort of special pleading that has got @entity8 into its current state			1
and an immediate riposte came from the @entity145 team , who dispatched the much - favored @entity41 1 - 0 in their opening game			1
the @entity145 have got quite good at this			0
they won the @entity8 championships in 1992 , a month after voting against the @entity150 on @entity8 integration			1
after @entity40 beat @entity18 in a memorable final , foreign minister @entity153 , surely one of the most affable @entity8 politicians ever , quipped ' if you ca n't join them , beat them			2
" the @entity145 approach this year was layers of disciplined defense			0
the @entity163 formation against @entity164 was similar -- a sort of bulldog defiance characteristic of a nation that 's never been quite sure of its @entity8 destiny			1
stoic @entity135 hold @entity169 as @entity136 lose at @entity98 bank @entity171 , the experts took a rigorously financial approach to football ( though they might be better employed investigating the fragility of some @entity98 banks			0
) they calculated the worth of each team based on the transfer market value of their players and predicted this semi-final line - up : " @entity28 ( 338 million euros ) against @entity81 ( 658 million euros ) ; and @entity18 ( 459 million euros ) against @entity135 ( 392 million euros )			0
of course these values are declining every day as the euro sinks against the dollar and the pound			0
in what might be bad news for @entity18 's chances , there could be an inverse relationship ( economic jargon ) between financial health and sporting prowess			0
@entity61 won @entity194 and @entity82 lifted the @entity21 in 2006 ; @entity81 won both @entity195 and the @entity21 in 2010			0
or it may be that these countries are in an economic mess precisely because their men - folk are outside playing football all the time			2
that football explains the world is well known			0
@entity204 , author of " how football explains the world : an @entity207 , " wrote that " wandering among lunatic fans , gangster owners and crazed @entity211 strikers , i kept noticing the ways that globalization had failed to diminish the game 's local cultures , local blood feuds and even local corruption			0
" in other words , football is exhibit a in the argument that national pride will never be subsumed by the worthy but essentially dull goal of @entity8 integration			1
one look at the @entity63 fans belting out their national anthem tuesday before the game against @entity232 ( surely no historic animosity there ) would confirm that			0
should players know their anthems ? in fact @entity8 may become so consumed by the tournament that the markets will simply forget to mark down the euro or price @entity99 debt at record highs			1
the @entity244 blog uncovered research by economists at the @entity247 from the last @entity21 in 2010			0
using minute - by - minute trading data for fifteen stock exchanges , they found that when the national team was playing , the number of trades dropped by 45 %			2
the @entity99 prime minister is doing his best to use @entity1 as a way of playing down his country 's debt crisis			1
hours after his government was offered 100 billion euros to help its indebted banks , @entity259 jetted off to @entity63 to watch @entity81 's first game			0
" i am going because the @entity99 team are world champions and i think it is good that the head of government be at this inaugural game , " he said			0
but now i feel bad			0
many @entity8 could n't wait for the @entity1 championships to begin just to escape the barrage of negative headlines about their continent 's future			1
the last thing they wanted was the competition becoming a metaphor ( albeit a less than convincing one ) for their problems			0
* @entity280 did not watch any of the games mentioned during working hours			2
