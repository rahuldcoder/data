@entity0 , @entity1 -- a lawyer breaks down sobbing in court			1
the president 's children sit in the public gallery			1
the secretary general of the ruling party , the @entity9 , sits behind them			1
outside , military veterans and riot police hold back crowds dancing in support of the president			2
this is no normal high court case hearing			2
at issue is " @entity18 , " a piece of artwork depicting the president of @entity1 as a @entity23 figure with his genitals exposed , accused of offending the dignity of @entity26			1
the painting has pitched culture and tradition against constitutional rights			1
it has polarized a nation : those who believe it is offensive to depict the president -- and in fact any black person -- in this way against those who believe in the freedom of expression			1
@entity1 is the custodian of one of the most progressive constitutions in the world , held up as a model state when it comes to protecting freedoms and rights			1
the furor began nearly two weeks ago when an exhibition entitled " @entity52 " went up in a small suburban gallery in @entity0			0
it was the artist @entity56 's interpretation of what has become of @entity1 's young democracy			1
and it was not kind			0
through his art he portrayed the ruling party , the @entity9 , as corrupt , selfish and full of broken promises			1
but it was the one painting of @entity26 that got the nation hot under the collar			1
for a few days it sat there largely unnoticed , quietly minding its own business , until the @entity9 woke up and saw the picture in a sunday newspaper			1
the party demanded it be taken down			2
and so the legal battle ensued			0
then , this week , along came the protesters , one white , one black , both working independently of each other , who calmly walked into the gallery and smeared the painting with red and black paint			2
both claimed the painting was an insult to the honor of the president			1
the two were arrested , the painting was taken down and the gallery closed			2
the image of the painting , however , remains on @entity94 ' website			1
the defacing of the painting was not going to stop this battle			2
foes of painting plan march to gallery today was the first day of the hearing in the @entity102 of @entity0			2
outside , the @entity9 had erected a stage and struggle songs burst out into the streets			1
throngs of people gathered with posters demanding @entity26 's dignity be restored and the painting destroyed			1
former @entity9 armed - wing veterans dressed in full military uniform held the crowds back from the court			1
reporters filmed their pieces to camera			0
inside the court an air of calm reigned despite being full to capacity			2
rows of journalists tweeted incessantly , @entity9 bigwigs greeted each other fondly , and a handful of the president 's 21 children looked on			1
sitting on the bench were three highly respected judges , one white @entity133 male , one @entity135 female and one black female : a true reflection of this country 's diversity and equality			2
the leading lawyer , @entity141 , began by arguing for the removal of the painting and the image on the basis that no one deserves such indignity whoever they are			1
the judges retorted that it was an impossible feat to take it out of public circulation			0
the image is everywhere : on social networks , @entity157 and the internet -- it even has its own wikipedia page			2
one judge then asked how dignity could be restored by removing the picture from websites			1
the senior lawyer began his answer			0
he took the court back to @entity1 's fight for freedom and human rights			1
they were now free and had been vindicated			0
his last line was , " the struggle was a just struggle			0
" it was then that the sobs rang out across the courtroom			0
the lawyer had broken down crying			0
as he began to talk of the struggle , he held back the tears , trying desperately to contain himself , but it was no use			0
the impact of his breakdown was made all the worse by the fact that he was hooked up to the microphones			0
his sobs were loud and clear for all to hear			0
with his head in his hands he fell to the desk			0
the judges looked awkward , adjourned the case and scuttled off into their chambers leaving a stunned courtroom to work out exactly what had just happened			0
@entity141 had been imprisoned and tortured on @entity194 during apartheid			0
he was a freedom fighter and is now a highly regarded lawyer			2
he simply could not contain his emotions when talking about the freedom that he and many other black people in @entity1 had fought for			1
he later said his line of argument had brought up many emotions that he had felt 25 years ago			0
he added that he should have had more self - control , but " unfortunately i did not '			0
when the court returned , @entity141 calmly walked back into the courtroom and requested a postponement			0
both the complainants and respondents agreed as did the judges			0
it was not to be a cut - and - dried case			0
three days have been set aside to hear the case in full at a date yet to be decided			0
so the nation awaits the final verdict as the court balances the president 's dignity against freedom of expression and in the meantime , the @entity9 has called for further protests and the boycotting of @entity94			1
the battle rages on .			0
