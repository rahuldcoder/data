-- following increased pressure from the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are introducing opt - out features to their @entity7 and @entity8 browsers			1
soon , users will have the option to stop personalized advertisements , ads tailored to your web - surfing habits that have sparked significant privacy concerns			1
will these new features allay privacy fears and @entity2 meddling ? last month , the @entity2 's @entity19 proposed a " @entity23 " tool to curb concerns over personalized or behavioral advertising			1
the @entity2 hoped the tool might be similar to the " do not call " registry -- the system that deterred telemarketers from causing so many headaches -- but offered very few technical details			1
such a comprehensive opt - out registry , as some have pointed out , would be difficult to implement			1
unlike " do not call , " which relies on unique telephone numbers , " @entity23 " could not depend on similar identifiers , as ip addresses are constantly changing			2
@entity3 and @entity4 have addressed some technical issues with their features , but are far from offering streamlined opt - out systems			2
on @entity7 , the feature is available as an extension called keep my opt - outs , which enables users to save opt - out preferences even once a browser 's cookies have been cleared			2
before , when one 's history was erased , so too was any opt - out preference			0
with this extension , @entity3 has made these particular cookies permanent ; however , users will still be required to opt - out of ad tracking themselves			0
@entity8 's " @entity23 " feature has a gaping loophole			0
for the tool to work , ad tracking companies essentially must opt - in to the system , and agree not to monitor web - surfing habits of users who have chosen to opt - out			2
thus far , according to the @entity59 , no companies have openly agreed to participate in @entity8 's " @entity23 " program , though @entity4 is urging advertisers to " honor people 's choices			0
" " @entity4 recognizes the chicken and egg problem , " @entity64 , @entity4 's global privacy head , wrote in a blog post			0
and so wo n't many users , who are likely to realize both @entity3 's and @entity4 's " @entity23 " features are not comprehensive			1
it 's also important to note that these extensions are opt - out systems , rather than opt - in			0
many consumer advocacy groups and government officials have pushed for the latter feature , which would mean behavioral advertising would no longer come default -- users would have to opt - in in order to see personalized ads. if @entity4 , @entity3 , and other browser companies do n't address these concerns soon , they could face legislative mandates , as @entity2 chair @entity86 has threatened			1
and such legislation could be as annoying to them as , well , telemarketers and personalized ads are to us			0

@entity2 hopes the tool might be similar to the " @entity102 " registry
