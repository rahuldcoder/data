the children 's father , @entity25 , 27 , was arrested december 3 and is now charged with two counts of murder and two counts of abuse of a corpse			1
@entity31 's lawyer , @entity30 , said monday that his client maintains " his innocence in regards to the death of the children			1
" @entity37 added that @entity23 might consider pleading not guilty by reason of disease or mental defect ( equivalent to an insanity plea in other jurisdictions )			0
the investigation kicked off november 18 , when @entity44 told @entity45 , @entity46 , police that she needed protection from @entity23 , who she claimed was holding her against her will			1

around 1 a.m. monday , @entity44 arrived from @entity46 to face the four additional charges , according @entity12			2
by early in the afternoon , she had not been questioned by @entity14 police			2
her arrest followed the discovery saturday morning of remains that authorities believe are those of young @entity62			2
searchers had planned to canvas woods abutting a six - mile stretch of highway just northwest of @entity67 , @entity6 , about 50 miles north of @entity14 , based on information provided by @entity31			1
but they found the remains -- less than half of a young body , including a skull and miscellaneous bones -- around 9 a.m. , within 30 minutes of starting the search			1

remains that police believe are those of the young boy were found last wednesday near @entity94 , @entity95			1

@entity23 and @entity44 blame each other for the siblings ' deaths , authorities said			0
police , who did not know the children were missing until november 19 , contend that @entity23 allowed @entity44 to abuse the children by restraining them with tape , putting socks in their mouths and confining them			1
a day earlier , @entity44 signed a domestic violence petition in @entity45 that said , " i feel he may have murdered his children , because he said they were non-responsive			0
he would not let me check on them			0
" she said @entity23 had told her " choices were made ... and he had to do what he had to do			0
" according to a police complaint , @entity23 between march 1 and november 19 allowed @entity44 to tape @entity24 's hands and feet , put a sock in her mouth and place her in a suitcase that was put in a closet for 14 hours			1
he also allowed @entity44 to tape @entity130 's hands to the side of his legs , tape a broom handle to his back , place a sock in his mouth and then make the child stand in a corner all night when the couple went to bed , according to the complaint			0
@entity23 and @entity44 have one infant daughter together , according to @entity44 's account in the @entity46 police report			2
