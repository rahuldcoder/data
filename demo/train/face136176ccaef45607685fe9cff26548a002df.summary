@entity0 -- the stakes of the stalemate are high -- and climbing			2
the partial government shutdown will enter its 14th day monday , just three days before the @entity7 government bumps up against its projected borrowing limit			1
talks both on ending the shutdown and on avoiding the debt ceiling have shifted to the @entity12 , as senate majority leader @entity13 and minority leader @entity14 , along with other top senators , began discussions this weekend			1
the @entity12 reconvened sunday afternoon , with @entity13 saying he would do " everything i can throughout the day " to reach some sort of bargain with the chamber 's @entity20 minority			1
but a source familiar with the ongoing @entity12 discussions expressed doubt that any significant progress would be made sunday evening			1
and the @entity12 adjourned shortly before 5 p.m. et , showing no signs of such progress			1
still , @entity13 struck a positive note as he spoke on the @entity12 floor			1
" i 've had a productive conversation with the @entity20 leader this afternoon			0
our discussions were substantive and we 'll continue those discussions			0
i 'm optimistic about the prospects for a positive conclusion , " he said			1
the @entity12 will meet again monday at 2 p.m. et. sen. @entity39 , @entity40 , said earlier that a bipartisan group of senators was still trying to hash out a plan acceptable to both sides			1
" we had 12 people meet yesterday , but just last night i had two more @entity47 and a @entity20 contact me to offer suggestions and say they want to be part of our group , " she said on @entity1 's @entity45			0
" it 's taken far too long			0
we never should be in this situation , " she added			0
" but i do believe there 's going to be a resolution this week			2
" likewise , sen. @entity58 , the @entity60 whip , said he thinks that @entity61 will ultimately get the job done			0
" i 'm a hopeful person			0
i believe we can do it			0
i hope sensible people prevail , because at this point , it 's not just a shutdown and all of the damage it 's caused , but if we default on our debt , it will have a dramatic impact on the savings account , on the retirement account of average @entity7 , " @entity58 , of @entity65 , said on @entity67 's " @entity66			1
" on the other side of the aisle , sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , said he too thinks @entity61 will find a way out of the crisis before thursday , when the @entity7 hits the debt ceiling			1
" we will have decided as a @entity61 that we need to avoid going over the debt limit , and we 'll figure it out			2
and it will probably be a relatively short - term solution , " @entity79 said			0
a weekend of rejections computer failure temporarily halts some food stamp payments but while senators ' comments and reports of talks were positive , the only actions over the weekend involved one " no " after another			0
-- @entity13 said saturday that the plan @entity99 was assembling is no longer on the table , because it treated reopening the government as a " concession			1
" @entity13 continues to demand that any plan include a " clean " bill , one that raises the debt limit and reopens the government with no strings attached			1
-- republicans blocked a measure to extend the debt limit with no strings attached , refusing to support a procedural vote that would have brought it to the @entity12 floor			1
-- @entity115 @entity20 leaders said president @entity116 rejected their proposal for a six - week extension of the federal debt ceiling			0
-- meanwhile , @entity20 objected to the prospect being floated over the weekend that the forced spending cuts known as sequestration , which have cut deeply into federal operations since march , might be rolled back under any eventual deal			0
@entity13 said that proposal " is not anything that came from us			1
" the @entity128 says it will be unable to pay the government 's bills unless the debt limit is increased by thursday			1
the partial shutdown of government services has been in effect since october 1			1
and sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , told " @entity139 " that the momentum that seemed to be building last week toward a resolution has stalled			2
" i do think we will see our way through this , but the last 24 hours have not been good , " he said			0
@entity143 , head of the @entity144 , said saturday the consequences of a failure to raise the debt limit would be dire for economies around the world			2
she spoke to @entity1 's @entity150 at an @entity152 conference in @entity0			0
" you know , i 've just spent the last two days with representatives of about 188 countries around the world			0
i would n't say they are confident			0
i would say they are concerned , and they are very anxious to see this crisis resolved , because they know it 's going to impact on their economy , " @entity143 said			0
supporters stand by representatives and government shutdown 7 crazy side effects from the shutdown @entity116 spoke by phone with @entity115 minority leader @entity171 on sunday to discuss the ongoing battle over the shutdown , the @entity115 said			1
the two agreed on the need for a " clean debt limit increase " and a " clean continuing resolution to open up the government and end the shutdown			1
" mindful that october 17 is just days away , @entity115 @entity20 leaders are considering all of their options even as @entity20 and @entity60 @entity12 leaders try to craft a deal on the debt ceiling , a @entity20 leadership aide , speaking on the condition of anonymity , told @entity1			1
one option @entity20 leaders are considering is sending back a measure to the @entity12 that would increase the debt limit ; exactly what it would contain is unknown at this time			1
but the aide noted that the @entity115 is able to move quicker than the @entity12 , and this idea could come into play			1
if a decision were made to pursue this idea , then it would require @entity60 support to pass in the @entity198			0
@entity47 meet with president @entity47 met with @entity116 for 75 minutes saturday afternoon , and a @entity12 @entity60 leadership aide said the party is unified			2
" democrats are willing to negotiate on anything @entity20 want to discuss as soon as we reopen the government and pay our bills , " said the aide			2
another @entity60 source said party leaders regard republicans as lacking a coherent position			0
they hope @entity215 can " cut through the clutter , " the source told @entity1 's @entity216			0
the sources , who are familiar with the talks , spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could speak candidly			0
despite the lack of agreement , sen. @entity221 , @entity223 - @entity222 , said progress was being made			2
" i think our @entity20 colleagues are moving in our direction with the fact that @entity231 is not a major part of the discussion anymore among most all @entity12 and many @entity234 , " he said			2
will 2014 election solve anything ? even as he demanded a " clean " bill , @entity13 said he and @entity215 are involved in " cordial " and " preliminary " discussions			2
" i hope that our talking is some solace to the @entity7 people and the world , " @entity13 said			1
he said @entity215 had approached him			0
