-- much has been written about the @entity1 of the @entity3 war			0
but there 's a much more significant war taking place right now on @entity7			1
it 's a war about freedom of speech in our new reputation economy ; it 's a war about what we legally should and should n't be able to say on @entity7			1
the latest battle in this war is being fought over the lord @entity17 case			1
you 'll remember that it was @entity17 who was identified by @entity7 users as being the senior @entity23 politician whom the @entity25 show said was a pedophile			1
the @entity25 , which had never revealed the alleged abuser 's name , apologized nonetheless for @entity17 being wrongly implicated			1
the false rumor then spread on @entity7 with , according to @entity17 's lawyers , more than 1,000 libelous tweets and 9,000 retweets maliciously destroying the innocent man 's reputation			1
as a result , @entity17 not only successfully sued the @entity25 for $ 185,000 , but is also now considering suing prominent @entity7 users such as @entity37 , the wife of the speaker of the @entity39 , who tweeted to her almost 60,000 followers : " why is @entity17 trending ? * innocent face *			1
" what 's significant about @entity44 's " @entity45 " strategy is his focus on " high - profile @entity47 " with more than 500 followers like @entity37 , comedian @entity49 and @entity51 journalist @entity50 who tweeted to his 56,000 followers : " i looked up @entity17 on t'internet			1
it says the strangest things			0
" while @entity17 's lawyers are encouraging many less well - endowed @entity7 users who spread the pedophile rumor to donate a small sum to a children 's charity , their focus appears to be on going after big names like @entity49 who , with his more than 442,000 followers , gives him an audience almost nine times the size of the main @entity7 account of @entity71 newspaper			1
cyber-libertarians like @entity74 's @entity73 argue that @entity17 's attack on @entity50 , @entity49 , @entity76 and the other notable @entity47 is " unwise and uncalled for " because these individuals do n't have the fact - checking resources of media companies			1
but what freedom - of - speech fundamentalists like @entity73 fail to recognize is that with all this new power should come new responsibility			0
and if one does , indeed , like @entity49 , have nearly half a million @entity7 followers , then one should indeed be as liable under the libel law as any other large media company			1
on @entity7 's @entity88 , it tells new users : " what you say on @entity7 may be viewed all around the world instantly			1
you are what you tweet ! " but this is wrong			0
if you have no followers , then what you say on @entity7 has , essentially , no significance			1
so , you are n't what you tweet			0
instead , you are the size of your @entity7 audience			2
thus , on @entity7 , the reach of one 's megaphone should come with commensurate accountability			2
welcome to our 21st century reputation economy in which individual brands like @entity50 or @entity49 have as much power as 20th century newspapers or television networks			0
that 's why @entity44 's legal strategy is so just			2
sure , slap the small @entity7 user , that digital peasant , with a symbolic fine for their thoughtless behavior			2
but the @entity23 lord is right to aggressively go after the new media aristocrats , with their enormous audience , who so thoughtlessly sullied his reputation and whom he claims have broken the @entity124 's libel laws			1
this should be a salutary lesson in our radical new media world			0
with media power comes media responsibility			0
and the larger one 's audience , the more responsibility one has to get the facts straight			0
it 's almost enough to encourage me to tweet : " why are @entity37 , @entity50 and @entity49 trending ? * innocent face *			0
" but then , with my almost 21,000 @entity7 followers , i might get sued myself			1
so i 'll resist the temptation and , instead , maintain a dignified silence in this latest battle in the war about freedom of speech in our @entity7 age			1
but it 's a tricky balancing act			0
early this year , @entity7 announced a new policy giving the company the ability to " reactively withhold content from users in a specific country -- while keeping it available in the rest of the world			2
" ( removing a tweet previously meant deleting it from the web entirely			0
) critics said the move was a form of censorship , but @entity7 promised tweets would be removed only upon request and only if they broke the law -- a system that @entity166 , one of the policy 's architects , defended as a way " to keep more tweets up in more places			2
" the company refused to comply with all six government removal requests in the first half of 2012 , but in october @entity7 blocked access in @entity176 to the account of a @entity179 group that is banned by the @entity176 government , in addition to removing anti-semitic tweets in @entity183			2
" never want to withhold content ; good to have tools to do it narrowly & transparently , " @entity166 tweeted			0
the microblogging service may still be figuring out the kinks of this new policy , but at a time when multinational corporations are caving left and right to countries like @entity194 , @entity166 's principled defense of free speech is vital			0
" no one wants a pen that 's going to rat them out , " he told the @entity195			0
" we all want pens that can be used to write anything and that will stand up for who we are			0
today 's war about online freedom of speech is being fought both with and about the @entity7 " pen			1
" let 's hope that he @entity17 case encourages powerful voices on @entity7 to self - censor tweets that might libel others			1
but that does n't mean i 'm in favor of censoring @entity7			2
so , for example , let 's also hope that @entity166 and his team resists calls by the @entity223 @entity222 lobby to ban political groups like @entity225 from @entity7			2
yes , this is a balancing act			0
and the future of free expression in our digital age rests on getting it right			0
