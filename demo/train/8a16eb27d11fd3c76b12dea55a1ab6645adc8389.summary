it 's not often you get insight into a destination from a heavy metal band , but in @entity6 , @entity7 's second city , locals are used to having to make a noise to get heard			1
" we 've got to go to the @entity14 , " @entity6 enthusiast @entity9 tells me after a day touring the city 's rich historical sites ( @entity14 , @entity15 27 , @entity6 ; +36 52 688 050 )			1
just off the historic center , @entity14 is a pub and live music venue masquerading as a junk shop filled with pre-loved sofas and a ceiling hung with hundreds of retired cymbals shimmering like fish scales			0
it has the atmosphere of a student party in an old building that 's waiting to be renovated -- or very possibly demolished			0
@entity29 is owned by @entity7 's best known heavy metal band , @entity30			1
sometimes referred to as the " @entity7 @entity31 , " the band has taken an international music genre and -- through lyrics , album covers , and an annual @entity37 party - concert -- made it all about their home city			1
it 's perhaps fitting that @entity30 should be seen as ambassadors for @entity6 -- the city sometimes needs a few power chords and pounding bass lines to get noticed			1
" foreigners think that @entity7 is @entity49 and there 's nothing else , " is a familiar refrain on @entity6 's streets			1
@entity7 's backup capital @entity6 has , at times , been more important than the current seat of power , with locals claiming it takes over in times of trouble			1
that does n't quite add up			0
@entity6 has survived 13th - century @entity62 invasions , the @entity63 , 150 years of struggle against the @entity65 , numerous conflicts and the turmoil of communism and still only briefly been the country 's capital twice			1
it took the helm once after a short - lived revolution in 1849 and for a second time at the end of @entity76 today , @entity6 may not be well known to tourists , but that only adds to the charm of this relaxed university city			1
it 's a small place ; the historical center is sized for strolling and regular cafe stops			0
the bizarrely elegant , stuffed - crocodile - decorated @entity84 in the art nouveau @entity87 ( @entity88 11 - 15 , @entity6 ; +36 20 363 6121 ) is a good place to pre-load with coffee before tackling the vertiginous stairs of the west tower of the @entity93 ( @entity94 , @entity6 ; +36 52 412 694 )			1
from the tower there 's a grand overview of @entity6 and and the surrounding area -- a vast sea of grassland stretching across the @entity101			2
these are the rich grazing lands that the horse - powered @entity104 tribes from the east settled in the ninth century and which their descendants , the @entity7 , have raised livestock on ever since			2
architectural mash - up there 's also a view of @entity6 's mix of architectural styles , the legacy of frequent devastating fires that back in the 19th century led the city 's students to form one of @entity120 's first - ever fire brigades			1
also visible from the rooftops are traditional weather cocks with @entity124 star and crescent moon symbols that once advertised to @entity65 invaders that the city preferred trading to fighting			0
@entity130 meant that craftsmen prospered and @entity6 became famous for -- among other things -- hats , clay pipes ( in the early 19th century 10 million were reportedly made a year , with thousands bought for @entity137 's navy ) and fine foods			2
back on the ground , perhaps fueled by cake or famed ice cream made with real fruit on the terrace of the @entity146 cafe ( @entity147 ter 6 , @entity6 ; +36 52 530 460 ) , it 's possible to explore more of the city 's student life , past and present			1
in the 500 - year - old @entity152 of @entity6 ( @entity147 ter 16 , @entity6 ; +36 52 516 856 ) , the current crop of undergraduates can be contrasted with exhibits celebrating the lives of their 17th - and 18th - century forbears			2
here visitors can view a reconstruction of one of the city 's early printing presses and explore the soaring library , with more than half a million books set amid serene green colonnades and soaring galleries			0
glass and concrete nearby , @entity167 ( @entity168 ter 1 , @entity6 ; +36 52 525 010 ) is an ultra-modern gallery with stark and curved glass and concrete walls			0
a winter showing here of challenging works by cutting - edge @entity176 artists has just given way to a summer - long exhibition of paintings depicting @entity7 grasslands and herder traditions			0
a tram ride connects @entity6 to @entity183 , a huge forest that 's home to @entity186 ( @entity187 1 , @entity6 ; +36 52 514 174 ) , a thermal spa and pleasure - baths complex that in august takes advantage of its nine - meter - high spiral and its open kamikaze slides to host the @entity193			1
@entity6 hosts its yearly flower parade and carnival this year august 15 - 20 -- the event dates to a cycling meet in 1900 when floral decorations got more attention than the riders			2
it was revived in 1969 , minus the pedalers , and now uses 3 million blooms to dress themed floats parading along three miles of decorated streets			0
' double sausage ' throughout the year , @entity6 hosts festivals dedicated to folk and choral music , poetry , gymnastics , jazz and " stuffed dishes			1
" at the 17th - century @entity216 ( @entity217 utca 6 , @entity6 ; +36 52 325 325 ) , the accommodation is reassuringly 21st century , but there 's timeless evening entertainment with traditional czardas dance - house music played by a trio in the cellar bar			2
for breakfast the hotel offers the dauntingly named , and just as dauntingly sized , " @entity6 double sausage			0
" with hundreds of years as a livestock market serving a farming hinterland @entity6 has always been about food , and not all of it sausage shaped			0
the highly ranked @entity230 ( @entity94 23 , @entity6 ; +36 30 55 57766 ) is another example of the city 's ability to combine the local and the cosmopolitan			2
after working in leading @entity137 restaurants , chef @entity235 returned to @entity6 to build on his family 's traditional recipes			0
for his " 20 mile menu " he uses ingredients sourced from within the stated distance -- terrain that encompasses the pasture lands of @entity244 and the livestock that @entity6 's wealth was built on			0
