seventy - four passengers trapped aboard an expedition vessel in the @entity2 for nearly a week will have to wait even longer as a rescue ship slowly makes its way through thick ice and snow			1
the @entity8 icebreaker ship @entity9 was 11 nautical miles away from the @entity11 - flagged @entity10 early monday , according to the @entity12			1
" it 's hard to tell if it makes it through , " said @entity13 , a spokeswoman for @entity12			2
" there are snow showers in the area that are causing bad visibility ; conditions are deteriorating			0
" visibility was only about 200 meters ( 656 feet ) , not enough to assess whether the ice breaker can cut through			2
" it 's a wait - and - see operation			2
it 's a very complex situation , " @entity23 said			2
this attempt by the @entity9 follows one by the @entity27 icebreaker @entity28 , or @entity29 , which was just six nautical miles away from the trapped vessel when it could n't get any closer due to unusually thick ice			1
the @entity29 went back to open water but remains in the area to provide support , said @entity36 , another spokeswoman for the @entity12			0
the @entity27 ship has a helicopter on board that could assist in evacuation			1
" we are waiting on the @entity9 to tell us if it can make its way through the ice			0
if it ca n't , then we will be shifting towards the helicopter , and obviously that is weather dependent , " @entity23 said			1
a @entity49 icebreaker was also en route to assist , but @entity12 called off that vessel 's mission saturday after it became clear that ship would n't get farther than the @entity27 boat			1
also , the @entity49 and @entity27 ships can break ice only about 1 meter ( 3.3 feet ) thick , whereas the @entity8 ship can pierce through floe about 1.35 meters ( 4.4 feet ) thick			1
" some reports say that the ice is at least 2 meters ( 6.6 feet ) deep			0
it 's a possibility that the @entity9 might not be able to break through that type of ice , " @entity36 said			1
chipper updates continue throughout the week trapped passengers have been giving mostly positive updates via @entity67 , greeting family members and telling everyone that they 're having a great time			0
" it 's my birthday today -- it could n't be a better day to have a birthday with my 80 - something new friends , " one female passenger declared cheerfully while standing on the ice in front of the stranded vessel			1
" this afternoon we 're gon na have some singing on the ice , which should be fantastic as well , " another female passenger adds			0
" it 's absolutely spectacular here ; it 's like this magical winter wonderland , " she declares with a smile as she waves her arms to point out the vast expanse of snow and a foggy sky			0
the group continues to do research and finds activities to stay occupied , but there is growing concern that blizzard conditions could worsen over the coming days , according to expedition leader @entity97 , an @entity8 professor of climate change			1
extreme conditions the rescue icebreakers were battling the planet 's coldest environment while trying to reach the @entity10 ship , whose 74 researchers , crew and tourists remained in good condition despite being at a frozen standstill since last monday			1
" the vessel is fine , it 's safe and everyone on board is very well , " @entity110 said			1
" @entity115 is really high			0
" the ship got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg of its research trip			1
according to @entity110 , a professor at the @entity122 , the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet ( 3 meters ) thick			2
it was about 100 nautical miles east of the @entity49 base @entity126 , about 1,500 nautical miles south of @entity127 , @entity128			1
on christmas morning , the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear			2
the crew had a " great @entity134 " despite their situation , @entity110 told @entity135			0
he said crew members have used the delay to get more work done			0
" we 've just kept the team busy , " he said			0
the expedition is trying to update scientific measurements taken by an @entity8 expedition led by @entity145 that set out in 1911			2
the expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began november 27			0
the second and current leg of the trip started december 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to @entity153 on january 4			0
@entity110 said the ship should still be back in @entity153 on time			0

an @entity8 icebreaker is now 11 nautical miles away
it 's not clear yet if it can break through the ice , @entity8 official says
a @entity27 ship ca n't break the ice but is staying nearby in case of helicopter evacuations
any helicopter rescue of 74 tourists and scientists on board will depend on weather
