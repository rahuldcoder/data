-- the tiniest @entity2 rumors can cause a big uproar			2
the latest : the blog @entity5 on wednesday published a story claiming the next - generation @entity2 will have a new connection port that 's about a third the size of the one on the current model			1
the reaction on blogs and on @entity11 has been largely negative , with commenters saying the new port -- used to charge the phone and connect it to other devices -- would render obsolete existing chargers and accessories such as speaker sets			2
" every other phone manufacturer decided back in 2008 to conform to the @entity24 standard , and that 's been wonderful , " one commenter , identified as @entity20 , wrote on the @entity5 story			0
" but @entity26 wants people to feel they have to buy proprietary accessories from them			0
do n't get me wrong			0
i respect them as marketers and profiteers			0
i just hate their contempt for me as a customer			0
" " are standards just too easy for @entity26 to use ? " asked @entity37 , a writer for the blog @entity39 , which focuses on mobile technology			0
" does the company feel the need to create its own , proprietary hardware to feel special , more profitable or even more popular ? " he added : " i understand the lust @entity26 has towards thinness and being able to cram more tech into a small package , but it can be achieved without its own port designs that can make the devices incompatible with other companies ' products			2
" @entity26 has n't announced whether or not it 's working on a new @entity2 , much less confirmed specifications such as the type of dock that will be included , and the company did not respond immediately to @entity0 's request for comment			1
most observers expect @entity26 to introduce its next @entity2 this fall since the current @entity62 model was launched last october and the company has a history of releasing upgraded phones each year			1
@entity5 said its report is based on interviews with three independent manufacturers of @entity26 accessories that said the new @entity2 will include a 19 - pin dock instead of the current 30 - pin model			1
in 2003 , @entity26 introduced the 30 - pin dock connector on the third - generation @entity73			1
since then , the port has been a fixture at the bottom of @entity26 's mobile devices , including the @entity2 and @entity78			1
the connection type is proprietary , meaning cords and accessories that use the 30 - pin dock only work with @entity26 devices			1
still , the dock has become " insanely ubiquitous , " as @entity85 writes , to the point that it 's almost a standard of its own			0
it 's unclear if the new dock will be another only - @entity26 standard			2
writing for the site @entity93 , @entity91 said the new port " presumably " adheres to the @entity96 standard , which is used on most other mobile phones			0
if that 's the case , he said , the switch could have all kinds of advantages , including saving consumers money ( a 30 - pin cord from @entity26 costs $ 19 ; @entity96 cords start at less than $ 1 ) and making it easier for @entity26 to comply with a @entity108 law that requires micro usb ports on new mobile phones			1
( @entity26 gets around this by selling an adapter in @entity108			0
) either way , if the @entity26 standard changes , @entity2 owners may be left , as @ shmidtb writes on @entity11 , with " a bunch of worthless cords " on their hands			1
what do you think ? would you welcome a new connector format ? let us know in the comments .			0

the next - generation @entity2 will have a smaller connection port , according to a report
a different - size port would mean existing @entity2 charging cords wo n't work on new model
such a switch could save customers money if @entity26 switches to a standard port size
