-- imagine a place where police use online dating services to entrap and arrest gay men			0
or a country that arrests a 14 - year - old girl for adultery and then performs an invasive " virginity test " on her			0
or where a woman is sentenced to death by stoning for adultery			2
@entity14 celebrities are rightly outraged to discover that places like this exist , and they 're showing it by boycotting the @entity18 , owned by an investment group of the @entity20 's , to protest his country 's new @entity22 laws against homosexuality and adultery			1
@entity27 is merely a newcomer on the scene			2
it joins 81 other countries where homosexuality is illegal			0
and , sadly , it 's hardly the only place in the world where adultery is punishable by death			1
but the place i was talking about before , where homosexuals are arrested and deported , and adulterers are sentenced to stoning , was n't @entity27			2
it was the @entity43 , a favorite destination and filming location for wealthy @entity14 celebrities			1
remember " @entity47 : ghost protocol " ? that was filmed in @entity50			0
@entity51 will perform in @entity52 this month			0
@entity53 performed in @entity50 in march			0
the last " @entity55 , " no. 7 , is reportedly filming there right now			0
@entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity58 -- have all been popular guests of the money - soaked @entity43			1
opinion : why stone them for who they love ? and the money flows both ways			0
@entity68 , wholly owned by the @entity43 , has invested hundreds of millions in @entity70 film companies			1
in 2012 , for example , its subsidiary , @entity71 , financed a new movie starring @entity74 called " @entity75 , " about the evils of hydraulic fracking			0
that 's right -- an anti-fracking movie was subsidized by the oil - rich @entity43			1
you got ta love @entity14			2
it 's unclear how far @entity27 will go in enforcing its newly adopted @entity22 lawâ € ” and there are few instances in recent years of the @entity43 actually carrying out @entity22 punishments , such as flogging			1
but the laws allowing such sentences are on the books			0
whereas it 's unlikely most @entity14 celebrities could locate @entity27 on a map ( it shares the huge island of @entity96 with @entity97 and @entity98 ) , i bet many know their way to @entity50			1
will they boycott the @entity43 , with its glitzy , @entity14 - friendly hotels , star - studded film festival , picturesque shooting locations and oil - rich investment money , if they know its politics are similarly intolerant ? @entity27 is a little too exotic , far away and easy to avoid			1
and while much closer to home , so is the @entity18			2
i 'm sure there are plenty of other venues willing to host movie premieres , record launch parties and @entity117 's entourage			0
so rather than @entity14 celebrities boycotting a @entity121 hotel -- in the town where they live , no less -- putting hundreds of @entity70 workers out of work , they should get to know the inconvenient truths about the world they live in and put their money where their mouths are .			1

@entity130 : celebrities boycotting @entity18 owned by @entity27 *sultan* 's investment group
@entity135 : @entity27 now has @entity22 law , but celebs happy to make *repressive* @entity43 a destination
@entity43 punishes homosexuality , adultery can bring death -- yet @entity14 makes movies there
@entity135 : if celebs want to *oppose* *repression* , shun @entity43 , not local hotel employing @entity70 workers
