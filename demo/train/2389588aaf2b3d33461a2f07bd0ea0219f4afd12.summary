-- after @entity3 's escape in the men 's quarterfinals , there was yet more drama at the @entity7 in friday 's women 's semifinals			1
but the scenes inside @entity11 in @entity12 were n't as riveting as the @entity14 ' comeback from two match points and two sets down against @entity17 on thursday			0
whereas @entity3 walked off court as the winner , a teary @entity18 had to be taken off the court in a wheelchair moments after crumpling to the ground with what tournament organizers called a heat - related illness			1
trailing 7 - 6 4 - 3 , @entity27 's @entity18 -- in her maiden grand slam singles semifinal -- retired and it gave @entity30 's @entity29 a place in the final against @entity33			1
the resurgent @entity34 returns to a major final for the first time since the @entity7 in 2009 -- she was the runner - up -- but did n't want to advance this way			1
" it was very difficult , " 10th - seeded @entity29 told the crowd			2
" you 're out here and you want to battle and finish off properly			0
" i just feel sorry for @entity18 , she played really well			2
unfortunately , she fell ill and i hope she 'll be okay			0
" already a fan favorite , former no. 1 @entity29 likely earned more backers when she crossed the net to check on the stricken @entity18			1
@entity18 , who underwent heart surgery as a young junior , had to lean against the backboard on center court for support when she was first overcome by the pain while holding a break point in the final game of the match			1
she was helped off court , where an evaluation then medical timeout ensued			0
about 10 minutes later -- after @entity29 was forced to wait for @entity18 without any recompense -- @entity18 played a few points prior to stopping and slumping to the ground			1
unable to continue , she was forced to officially retire			0
" you have to feel for @entity18 , being in her first grand slam semifiinal and having to leave the court like that , " 2013 @entity69 champion @entity68 , acting as a pundit for @entity67 's @entity66 , said			1
" and having to go through that much pain , it 's pretty difficult			0
" i remind all of us how hard it is to be on the court yourself			0
it 's you and your tennis racket , and you have to compete			0
you have to beat the opponent , your conditions , beat everything really and be ( as fit ) as possible			0
" it was really painful to watch as a person and player			0
" before @entity18 's physical issues , it was a fiercely contested battle			2
@entity18 could n't serve out the first set and also led by a break early in the second against @entity29 , who revealed that she had been bed ridden herself the last couple of days			1
@entity18 's plight must have struck a chord with @entity33			1
appearing woozy , @entity33 had to retire from the doubles at @entity69 in july			2
her tussle against @entity100 in the second women 's semifinal lacked any drama			2
@entity33 , seeking her first grand slam title of the campaign and 18th overall , overpowered the @entity107 lefty 6 - 1 6 - 3			1
the lone worry for the two - time defending champion came when she was broken trying to serve out the contest			0
sunday 's finale figures to be close			0
@entity33 and @entity29 met twice leading into the @entity7 , and the current no. 1 prevailed in three tight sets on both occasions			1
a victory for @entity33 and she would tie legends @entity116 and @entity118 in grand slam singles titles			2
" she obviously wants to win and go for her first grand slam and i want to win and make a little history , " @entity33 told the crowd .			0
