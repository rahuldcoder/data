-- " i 'm just gon na put a little more butter in there , y'all , " she said as she plopped a large chunk into the skillet			0
" oh my , " she added , " i 've gone and put a whole stick in by now			0
" i was watching @entity9 on the @entity10 , whipping up a shrimp @entity12 © to go over pasta			1
i thought to myself , " i could make a similar dish that would look much better ( hers was murky from all the butter ) , taste much better ( fresh , clean flavors from a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil , garlic , dry vermouth and herbs ) , with a fraction of the fat and calories			0
" later that day , i read about @entity9 's revelation that she had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes three years ago and is now a paid spokeswoman for @entity30 , the pharmaceutical company that supplies her diabetes medication			1
she says the diagnosis will not change the way she cooks			1
what a shame ! like many people , @entity9 has genes that predispose to weight gain , insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes when physical activity is insufficient and calories are consumed in excess , especially from quick - digesting carbohydrate foods that cause spikes of blood sugar			1
type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that greatly increases risks of cardiovascular disease , disability and premature death			1
the good news is that many , if not most , cases can be put into remission through lifestyle changes : losing weight , increasing activity and adhering to a low - glycemic - load diet , especially minimizing consumption of flour and sugar			0
taking a drug to lower blood sugar without making those lifestyle changes is a classic example of trying to deal with a problem without going to the root of it			0
( another is taking a pill to suppress stomach acid so that you can eat foods that cause heartburn without it			0
) @entity77 : @entity78 on @entity80 food beyond the butter the queen of high - fat , high - calorie " southern comfort " food likes to say that she encourages her followers to practice moderation in eating her rich dishes			1
how about using her charm and culinary skills to teach them to make healthier versions of those dishes without sacrificing flavor or any of the pleasure of eating ? if she does n't think that 's possible , i 'd encourage her to eat at one of the @entity102 restaurants in @entity103 and @entity104			1
the food there is designed to emphasize flavor and pleasure along with good nutrition			2
too many of us -- including @entity9 , i would guess -- think that food that 's good and food that 's good for you are in opposition			1
unless you have experienced truly delicious , healthy food , you wo n't believe it exists			1
the @entity10 has become a major entertainment channel			2
a lot of people watch it			0
sadly , most of the shows focus on making ( or eating huge portions ) of just the kinds of foods that promote obesity and all too often the disturbances of metabolism that can lead to type 2 diabetes			1
the societal problems resulting from our unhealthy eating habits are grave ; for one , the @entity133 has expressed concern that the obesity epidemic in young people is shrinking the pool of acceptable applicants for military service			0
the @entity10 could begin doing public service by teaching people to prepare more sensible meals			2
it could start with you , @entity9			2
you have the perfect reason to change your ways and the perfect platform to disseminate your message			0
show your loyal fans how not to need diabetes drugs			0
and whenever you 're ready to accept my challenge for a shrimp @entity12 © cook - off , y'all just let me know			0
join the conversation on @entity157 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : @entity9 has type 2 diabetes , says it wo n't change way she cooks
instead she is a paid spokeswoman for a diabetes medication ; a shame , he says
he says the food she makes can be made in more healthful way ; she should set example
@entity160 : she and @entity10 have *responsibility* to promote healthy eating , *prevent* diabetes
