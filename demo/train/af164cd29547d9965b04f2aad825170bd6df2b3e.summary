-- it 's vital that young @entity2 learn the history of our amazing nation			1
being an @entity2 requires knowing what it means to be an @entity2			2
it 's the fabric that binds us together and helps us understand who we are			0
today , unfortunately , many of our students are failing to learn @entity2 history , including our founding principles and values			1
and they 're failing to learn why @entity2 remains an exceptional nation			1
for two generations , we 've watched our nation 's memory of the past slip away			0
the problem of historic amnesia is widespread , as evidenced by alarming results from the @entity23 , which tests students in grades four , eight and 12 in several broad subject areas every few years			2
among the survey 's most frightening findings is our students ' lack of knowledge in @entity2 history			1
just 20 % of fourth - graders , 17 % of eighth - graders and 12 % of 12th - graders were at grade - level proficiency in @entity2 history in the 2010 exams			1
this lack of knowledge goes to the very basics			0
only one in three fourth - graders could identify the purpose of the @entity42			1
less than half understood why @entity44 was an important @entity2 leader			1
and a majority of fourth - graders did n't know why the @entity47 left @entity48			1
these are frightening statistics , indicating that our children lack an understanding of our nation 's history and the traits that have made @entity2 great			1
as the author of three children 's books on @entity2 history , i 've visited many classrooms across the country to share the adventures of @entity65 , my time - traveling pachyderm , with children ages 4 to 8			1
i 've found most young students to be energetic , enthusiastic and eager to learn			1
we can get children engaged in learning at an early age if we as adults have enthusiasm for learning as well			2
our history includes wonderful role models			0
in writing " @entity77 " ( published this week , in which @entity78 the @entity79 discovers the @entity80 ) , i was reminded that the brave men and women who fought to win our freedom were surprisingly young			0
@entity87 was just 18 , barely older than a high - school graduate			0
and yet these patriotic heroes were engaged in profound , often dangerous work			0
they were models of sacrifice , civic - mindedness and determination			0
with education surveys showing dismal results , we must find creative ways to teach our children @entity2 history			1
in " @entity77 " and the @entity78 the @entity79 series , my goal is to highlight the wonderful achievements of our country , to arouse a love for @entity2 and to communicate why @entity2 is indeed a special nation			2
like children 's books , educational video games , too , have enormous potential to make history come alive			2
and we are only beginning to see the potential of online systems like @entity114 to revolutionize learning			0
there are many ways to improve the challenged state of education , but parents , teachers and mentors must pursue them eagerly			0
it was 232 years ago this month , on october 19 , 1781 , that the @entity125 surrendered to @entity44 's @entity126 at @entity127			2
this pivotal moment concluded an eight - year war in which thousands of brave men and women gave their lives to win the freedom we enjoy today			0
yet we are for the first time in our history beginning to lose sight of our founders ' sacrifice and wisdom			0
we must fight historical amnesia to ensure that future generations continue to appreciate the greatness of our nation			0
