@entity0 -- the @entity2 engaged in a heated debate thursday on an issue at the heart of the fight over energy reform : whether the @entity8 should have the authority to impose clear limits on the emission of greenhouse gases			1
the chamber is expected to vote on a " resolution of disapproval " drafted by sen. @entity16 , @entity17 , that would prevent the @entity8 from further regulation of air pollution from vehicles and industrial facilities			1
@entity16 has argued that new rules should be created only by @entity23 , not an executive agency			0
" it would amount to an unprecedented power grab , ceding @entity23 ' responsibilities to unelected bureaucrats and move a very , very important debate , a critical debate , from our open halls to behind an agency 's closed doors , " @entity16 argued on the @entity2 floor			1
@entity16 's measure is vehemently opposed by environmentalists who say the @entity8 's decision to regulate greenhouse gases is based on scientific research			1
" i believe it 's ridiculous for politicians -- elected senators -- to make this scientific decision			2
it is not our expertise , " replied sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , chairwoman of the @entity45			0
" we 've got to stop this attack on science and health			2
" it is unclear whether there are 51 votes in the @entity2 to approve the measure , which has bipartisan support , even though its prospects in the @entity59 are slim			1
regardless , the administration issued a veto threat on tuesday			0
the @entity16 resolution " would undermine the administration 's efforts to reduce the negative impacts of pollution and the risks associated with environmental catastrophes , like the ongoing @entity70 oil spill , " a @entity59 policy statement asserted			2
at issue is a 2007 @entity74 ruling determining that the @entity8 has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the rules of the @entity78			1
in december , the agency concluded scientific findings and declared that carbon dioxide and five other gases constitute pollutants that should be further restricted			2
in april , the agency announced new rules for vehicles : a mandatory increase in fuel efficiency coupled with reductions in gas emissions , starting with the 2012 model year			0
" when the @entity78 became law in 1970 , only five pollutants were initially listed			0
since then , dozens of additional pollutants have been listed , and the air we breathe is better for it , " argued sen. @entity94 , @entity95			0
detractors of the @entity8 contend that the @entity78 was never intended to give federal agencies full control over greenhouse regulations but rather to check industrial and commercial structures			1
such regulatory decisions , they argue , should be made by @entity23			0
" @entity8 regulation of greenhouse gases does not move us any closer to a clean energy future or to reducing our dependency on foreign oil			1
and furthermore , it simply is the wrong tool for addressing greenhouse gas emissions , " said sen. @entity111 , @entity112			0
@entity116 's sentiment was echoed by fellow @entity118 @entity117 of @entity119 , @entity120 of @entity121 and @entity122 of @entity112			0
though @entity16 said that she is not a skeptic of global warming and is " not going after the science , " many of her supporters have turned the dispute into a proxy debate on the scientific evidence			2
" there is nowhere a scientific consensus on one of the @entity8 's findings that humans are causing warming or that warming is necessarily bad for the environment or for humankind , " claimed sen. @entity130 , @entity131			1
opponents of the resolution claim that their colleagues are choosing to ignore the scientific consensus in favor of electoral politics			1
" the @entity16 resolution gives the @entity2 a choice between real science and political science , " said sen. @entity147 , @entity148			1
" that 's what it comes down to			0
" " this discussion about global warming is now political , not scientific			0
and this is absurd , " added sen. @entity158 , @entity159			0
@entity8 administrator @entity160 claimed in a @entity162 column monday that @entity16 has sided with " big oil companies and their lobbyists " in an effort to " take away @entity8 's ability to protect the health and welfare of @entity169 from greenhouse gas pollution			1
" senate majority leader @entity171 , @entity172 , has said he wants the @entity2 to approve new energy legislation this summer to address both global warming and the oil spill in the @entity176			2
@entity1 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

new : supporters of resolution claim @entity8 has exceeded proper authority
new : opponents argue that resolution puts politics *ahead* of real science
