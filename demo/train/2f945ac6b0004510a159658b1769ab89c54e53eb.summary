-- acclaimed @entity2 program " @entity3 " has retracted an entire episode about working conditions inside @entity6 , the @entity7 manufacturer that builds much of @entity9 's most popular hardware , after learning the reporter " partially fabricated " information about his visit to the factories			1
in the episode , @entity2 aired a monologue from reporter @entity15 , a self - proclaimed performer whose one - man show , " @entity17 of @entity18 , " detailed alarming labor practices which he claimed to witness during his time visiting @entity6			1
among the many facts @entity21 fabricated , according to @entity2 , were the number of @entity6 factories he visited , the number of workers he spoke with , as well a major lie about meeting with a number of workers who claimed to have been poisoned by chemicals used on @entity31 assembly lines			1
" @entity21 lied to me and to " @entity3 " producer @entity38 during the fact checking we did on the story , before it was broadcast , " the show 's host , @entity35 , wrote in a blog post on friday			1
" that does n't excuse the fact that we never should 've put this on the air			2
in the end , this was our mistake			1
" the retraction came even as consumers lined up friday to buy @entity9 's latest ipad amid protests over its treatment of workers -- protests that did little to dampen sales			2
public debate rages on about working conditions inside of @entity6 's @entity7 factories , which have for years been the subject of reports that employees endure long hours and unsafe working environment			2
@entity62 dug into the subject more than a year ago in a cover story after 17 @entity6 employees committed suicide			2
more recently , the @entity67 reported a series of investigative pieces further detailing the undesirable jobs of @entity6 employees			2
in an unprecedented response from the normally stoic @entity9 , the company responded to the reports publicly by cooperating with the @entity75 for audits of its entire supply chain			0
an entire page dedicated to @entity9 supplier responsibility can now be found on @entity9 's website			0
@entity21 issued a statement about the incident on his personal blog : " i stand by my work			1
my show is a theatrical piece whose goal is to create a human connection between our gorgeous devices and the brutal circumstances from which they emerge			0
it uses a combination of fact , memoir , and dramatic license to tell its story , and i believe it does so with integrity			0
" certainly , the comprehensive investigations undertaken by @entity67 and a number of labor rights groups to document conditions in electronics manufacturing would seem to bear this out			0
" " what i do is not journalism			0
the tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism			0
for this reason , i regret that i allowed @entity3 to air an excerpt from my monologue			1
@entity3 is essentially a journalistic -- not a theatrical -- enterprise , and as such it operates under a different set of rules and expectations			1
" " but this is my only regret			0
i am proud that my work seems to have sparked a growing storm of attention and concern over the often appalling conditions under which many of the high - tech products we love so much are assembled in @entity7			0
" @entity2 's " @entity3 " website was bombarded with traffic upon news of the retraction , buckling the site under the torrent of traffic			1
@entity9 , @entity2 and @entity21 did not immediately respond to requests for comment			2
@entity62 confirmed that none of @entity21 's @entity142 performances of @entity17 of @entity18 were canceled after news of the retraction , save for one special broadcast : the april 7 show slated for performance at the @entity147 , which was originally sponsored by @entity3 and @entity147 public radio station @entity148			1
