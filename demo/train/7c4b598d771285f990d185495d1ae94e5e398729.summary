@entity0 -- @entity2 has had a bad couple of weeks , really a bad month since the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6			0
the media spotlight has relentlessly focused on him			0
but there is an incumbent in the race , too , and an incumbent with a record that also reveals important disappointments , errors and failures			1
over the next month , president @entity16 will stand on stage beside @entity2 and submit to press questioning before millions of tv viewers			1
here are 10 questions i 'd like to hear him answer : 1 ) more than 50 @entity24 and coalition soldiers have been killed so far this year by supposedly friendly @entity26 forces			1
two @entity24 were fatally shot just last week by @entity26 we trained and equipped			1
these so - called " green on blue " attacks now account for 14 % of all coalition casualties			1
what questions would you like to ask the candidates ? share a short video question			0
in 2009 , you ordered 33,000 additional @entity24 forces into @entity26			1
three years later , @entity26 looks no more stable than it did in 2009			1
can you tell us specifically what the @entity26 surge accomplished ? 2 ) campaigning in 2008 , you called for tearing down the walls that separated the @entity41 world from the @entity42			1
you granted your first post-inauguration interview to @entity45 television and told the interviewer : " my job to the @entity41 world is to communicate that the @entity24 are not your enemy			0
" you traveled to @entity50 , @entity51 , in 2009 to deliver a speech offering " a new beginning " in @entity24 relations with the @entity41 world			0
with the discovery that our ally @entity59 was home to @entity61 , with a 9/11 denialist now elected president of @entity51 , with our embassies under attack , with the news only in this past week that an @entity51 schoolteacher was sentenced to six years in prison for postings judged offensive to @entity41 on his @entity72 page and mobs in @entity74 burning @entity76 temples -- why have your hopes for change been so brutally disappointed ? 3 ) after the lethal attack on the @entity24 @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity24 intelligence agencies collected information that the attacks were premeditated and coordinated by elements of @entity86 in @entity87 , and timed to the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			1
yet your administration insisted for more than a week that the attacks were a spontaneous reaction to a @entity94 video			2
@entity95 , @entity24 ambassador to the @entity96 , was sent to five sunday morning shows to repeat a claim that she -- and you -- had to have known was untrue			0
the video maker is now under arrest , ostensibly because of parole violations , but pretty obviously for exercising his free - speech rights			2
why did n't you just tell the truth to the @entity24 people from the start ? 4 ) can you today guarantee that @entity108 will not have acquired a nuclear weapon by the time you finish a second term in office ? 5 ) you inherited the worst economic crash since the 1930s			1
the economy hit bottom in the summer of 2009 and a recovery then began			2
yet this recovery has been the slowest and weakest since @entity120 blames you for the collapse			2
but why should n't @entity24 blame you for the meager record since recovery began more than three years ago ? 6 ) you propose to allow the @entity125 tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 to expire on income above $ 250,000			1
that would raise the top rate of federal income tax back to 39.6 %			0
when the @entity131 is fully implemented , the top rate will rise past 40 % , including the new health care surtax			0
almost all states collect income taxes of their own , rising nearly to 10 % in @entity135 and even beyond in @entity136			0
do you believe there a percentage level at which the government is taking just too much ? what is it ? 7 ) you emphasize more college education as the most important way to raise worker wages			2
yet even before the @entity146 began , wages were actually dropping for new college graduates			0
as technology enables the outsourcing of white - collar jobs , too , it 's ceasing to be true that a college degree in itself translates into a rising standard of living			2
got any other ideas ? 8 ) you 've expressed concern about growing wealth disparities in @entity24			0
one cause of those disparities is the huge surge of low - wage immigration since 1970 : almost 30 million newcomers			1
these newcomers are three times as likely as the native - born to lack a high - school diploma			1
even before the @entity146 , they were 50 % more likely to be poor than the native - born			2
the best data show that even the great - grandchildren of low - skill latino immigrants continue to struggle in the high - tech economy			1
your immigration proposals call for granting illegal immigrants a path to citizenship , creating incentives for more illegal entry in the future and continuing family reunification policies that will maintain our present low - skill immigration intake for years and decades to come			0
how do you reconcile your immigration proposals with your promise to strengthen the @entity24 middle class ? 9 ) your administration reacted to the financial crisis with an $ 800 billion fiscal stimulus			0
you promised that it would create jobs and rebuild @entity24 infrastructure			0
yet @entity192 's latest plan for the @entity194 rail corridor can promise no shortening of travel times until the 2040s			0
can you give examples of any real - life improvements to our infrastructure that were achieved by your stimulus ? please be as specific as possible			0
10 ) if you 're re-elected in 2012 , what hope is there that the next four years will be less acrimonious and ineffectual than the past two ? can you acknowledge any fault at all on your own side for the paralysis in @entity0 -- and what will you change to try to make your second term less rancorous than your first ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 : president @entity16 has a record that should be questioned in the *debates*
he says @entity16 should be asked about results of @entity26 surge and " green - on - blue " attacks
@entity223 : ask about slow economic recovery and what level of taxation he thinks is too high
ask @entity16 how he would govern *differently* in second term , @entity212 says
