it 's like something from a sports movie : a teen in a basketball uniform makes an improbable shot , then gets hoisted on the shoulders of his teammates while the crowd cheers and chants his name			2
but @entity12 , a senior at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , did n't hit a game - winning basket			1
his achievement last saturday was even rarer			0
@entity12 , who has autism , has served as the @entity21 ' student manager all four years he 's been in high school			1
his duties include keeping the gym clean and making sure the basketballs are properly inflated			0
and for fun , he practices taking half - court shots			1
he set a goal of making 1,000 such shots before graduating -- a lofty goal for anyone , let alone a kid who is not an official player on the basketball team			2
but he kept at it , and over the years teammates and coaches kept count as @entity12 came in early to shoot or heaved up half - court shots during practice			1
when @entity12 reached 999 made shots , coach @entity40 put him in his first - ever varsity game on saturday against rival @entity43			1
@entity12 scored the first basket of the game on an uncontested layup , then went to the bench and high - fived his coach to cheers from the crowd			1
but the real highlight came at halftime , when he stepped to half court and began launching shots in his trademark underhand style			2
on his third try , the ball sailed cleanly through the net			0
@entity12 raised his hands in triumph , and the gym erupted in cheers			0
in a storybook moment , he was lifted on his teammates ' shoulders to chants of " @entity69 ! @entity69 ! " " this was such an exciting experience , " @entity12 told the @entity70 afterward			0
" it felt like i was in heaven			0
