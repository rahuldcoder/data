-- with two tv shows , an entertainment company and a new style website to her name , @entity1 is a 37 - year - old businesswoman at the top of her game			1
she has already reinvented herself once , adding entrepreneurial acumen to her modeling portfolio			1
yet this year @entity1 decided to hit the books , enrolling in an executive education program at @entity12			1
why go to school when you already sit atop a growing entertainment empire ? for many high - level executives these days , sitting in the corner office is n't enough			1
many who have accomplished a great deal in their profession are making time for " to step back and to look at that success and look at where ( they 're ) going , " said @entity25 , who chairs the management program in which @entity27 is enrolled			1
taking an executive education course is just one way that those who have already achieved career success seek out new horizons			1
some leaders decide to take their business in a new direction , while others change industry entirely			1
how to have a ' rock star ' career @entity42 , who left the tech sector after climbing the ranks at @entity45 , said : " you 've achieved a lot in terms of recognition , you 've probably made more money than you ever thought you would			1
the question you ask yourself is : what really makes you the happiest from this point on ? " as conceptions of what constitutes " reaching the top " change , we look at what some executives do after reaching ceo status			1
learn to do business even better a mogul in the making , @entity27 has signed up for the @entity66 ( @entity65 ) program at @entity12			1
the nine - week program , spread out over three terms , accepts candidates who " hold a significant equity stake " in a firm with " annual sales of at least $ 5 million			2
" @entity12 's @entity65 program gives its participants a chance to plan how to build on their success -- and head in new directions -- " using a set of analytical tools and lenses that allow you to do things on purpose as you go forward , " according to @entity25			2
business owners from around the world come to campus to start with fundamentals like risk management , marketing and finance but segue into big decision - making subjects like growth strategies and legacy planning			2
@entity25 said the peer group is intended to build a confidence - boosting community , one that can let already successful business owners contemplate taking on big new projects			2
" the content of what we teach is important and it 's been tailored to what business owners need to know , but what 's really , really the value of program is the community you form , " @entity25 said			2
it can be lonely at the top , particularly if you run a company that 's independent rather than supported by venture capital			2
in the @entity65 program , " you 've met people here who know exactly what you learned , sat in the same class with you and debated in the lunchrooms			2
you can get a couple people that you really respect and form an advisory board			0
" try a new occupation some leaders approach the top of the corporate ladder and decide to head in another direction entirely rather than stay in the game			0
@entity42 made his name in high - tech as a senior vice president at @entity45 and as ceo of internet tv company @entity133 , but bailed on corporate management two years ago			1
@entity42 said that packing it in for a sailboat in the @entity137 did n't have the same appeal as finding a new job , one that tickled his intellect in ways that overseeing a company 's operations had not			0
" a ceo 's life is pretty tough , it 's enormously compromising of any sense of personal life , " said @entity42 , who is now a venture capitalist			1
" i missed that feeling of seeing what 's going to happen and also being able to catch a wave before other people know the wave is there , and that 's really what a venture capitalist does			0
" my job now is intellectually just as challenging as the operating job was , but includes the ability to operate without being in the limelight			0
" add " non " to the profit when @entity166 sold his tech company @entity167 , he did n't plan to stay on as ceo after the merger			1
faced with a chance to go back to the basics , he discovered that reinventing yourself carries uncertainties			0
" the question we all hope we get faced with is , ' if i could do anything in the world what would it be ? ' but it 's also pretty daunting , " he said			0
" that kind of dovetails into a whole bunch of other fears -- of whether you can get traction in a new area , as you become exposed to different languages , different jargons , different networks			0
" @entity166 knew that he would n't have to worry about a salary going forward and realized that even though he was good at engineering , he did n't leap out of bed wanting to go do it			0
" i was a bit burned out on it			0
" what did make him jump ? a lifelong love of animals			0
so he founded the @entity198 , and for the last 17 years he has been the executive director of a global organization that counts @entity201 wild dogs , saiga antelopes and snow leopards among its client base			1
pursuing a personal passion in a non-profit context did n't mean it was all smooth sailing for @entity166			0
non-profit @entity208 still have to operate businesses , raise funding and management personnel -- just in a context with very different rules and culture , he said			0
