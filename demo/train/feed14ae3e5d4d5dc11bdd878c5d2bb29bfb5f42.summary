@entity0 comes down to a couple of key weeks , but here we are : gun control , immigration reform and the budget -- all front and center , right now			1
it 's an odd time in @entity0			2
the president has been dating @entity13 , dining with senators with whom he has hardly spoken in the past			1
@entity13 seem to believe they can actually work with the president -- on immigration , at least			1
as for guns , well , some in the @entity13 seem ready to filibuster an issue -- background checks -- that has overwhelming public support			1
" that wo n't do us a lot of good , " moans one @entity13 pollster			1
" we will look like the party taking extremist positions			2
" should anyone be able to buy guns ? share your views remember how well that worked with women in the last election ? and then there 's the budget			1
the president decided to propose one this year that starts with compromise -- containing some of the entitlement reforms that he worked out with @entity44 speaker @entity43 before the " grand bargain " became the grand failure			1
a couple of senior @entity13 pollsters tell me that they ca n't quite figure out why the president did something guaranteed to annoy his liberal base			1
how about this for an answer : when all else fails , it does n't hurt to look credible			0
better yet , it does n't hurt actually to be credible			0
after all , what 's the downside ? " when you are dealing with dysfunction , the best you can do is demonstrate that you are reasonable , " one senior administration official tells me			2
" the alternative would be throwing fuel on the flames			0
we need to be serious here			0
" it 's about time			0
understand this : this is a not a strategy hatched by a bunch of @entity72 at the @entity44			0
it is borne of necessity , and bred with an understanding of a public that has just about had it with @entity0			0
the president played tough in the sequester fight -- calling for new revenues -- and he lost			0
now he 's not overplaying his hand ; he 's playing it smart			1
on immigration , he 's hanging back , letting congressional negotiators take the lead			2
he was called out for doing that on health care reform -- rightly so , allowing top democrats @entity88 and @entity90 to manage an unpopular process and produce an unpopular bill			0
but this time , it 's different : @entity13 understand that immigration reform has now become a gateway issue			1
' it 's now a basic way for us to find our way back into national politics , " one @entity13 pollster tells me			1
" it does n't solve our problem with @entity106 voters by itself , but it helps			0
" even polls show that a majority of @entity13 voters -- once opposed to reform -- are now on board with some version of it			2
the notion of a " pathway to citizenship " still stirs all kinds of fears about amnesty with the @entity13 base , but that 's less of an issue these days : all things considered , any gain in @entity106 voters outweighs some shrinkage of the base			1
it 's a trickier route for the president on guns			1
@entity132 did n't intend for gun control to be part of his second - term legacy ; it came to be after @entity137			1
and this is an issue , by the way , that splits the @entity141 more than it splits the @entity13			2
a half - dozen @entity141 @entity143 races in pro-gun states next year could hang in the balance			0
and if the @entity141 lose those senators -- and ca n't break a @entity13 filibuster -- it 's dangerous for them , too			1
not as dangerous , of course , as the @entity13 holding up any vote on a gun bill			2
that , i would argue , could have a great deal of impact on the midterm elections			0
why ? because the president will continue to take the issue directly to the voters , 90 % of whom agree with him on background checks			0
it 's a delicate time here in @entity0			0
if nothing happens on guns , for instance , what about the rest of the @entity132 agenda ? " if you ca n't pass a bill on guns in this environment , what can you ever do ? " asks one senior administration official			1
" it sets the bar so high for anything , people will be demoralized			0
" the result ? retreat			0
maybe some sort of immigration reform passes ( it 's in everyone 's self - interest ) but no tax reform			1
nothing big on the agenda , just small - scale items			0
perfect for politicians unable to respond to crisis , much less the will of the people			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			2

@entity198 : president @entity132 's legacy could be shaped in a couple of weeks
@entity132 has been reaching out to @entity13 , seeking *progress* on budget , guns , immigration
she says @entity132 has been taking risks in the interest of seeking compromise
@entity198 : president 's strategy is smart , but is @entity215 up to the *challenge* ?
