@entity0 running back @entity1 will tentatively go to trial december 1 on a felony child abuse charge , but that date could be pushed back if a @entity6 judge must recuse himself for calling attorneys " media whores			1
" until the trial is finished , @entity1 will be barred from having contact with the son involved in the criminal case , but the judge set no such parameters for @entity1 's contact with his other children			1
@entity1 , who was accompanied by his wife , other family members and legal team , appeared in court during the brief wednesday hearing			1
one of his attorneys , @entity23 , and @entity25 district attorney @entity24 engaged in a serious conversation for about 30 minutes before approaching the bench			2
it was difficult for those in the gallery to hear what was being said among the lawyers and judge , but @entity23 's spokeswoman said after the hearing , " i do n't think the judge ever asked for a plea			2
as we said yesterday , if the judge asks , @entity1 will plead not guilty			1
" it 's not clear when @entity1 will enter a plea , but a recusal hearing for 9th district court judge @entity43 was set for november			1
the possibility of a recusal was raised after @entity24 approached the bench with @entity23 's legal team and told @entity48 , " it 's come to my attention that on october 2 you referred to mr. @entity23 as a whore			0
" " i 'm sorry ? " case interjected			0
" ... mr. @entity23 as a whore , specifically a media whore			2
and you also called me a whore or a media whore , " @entity24 said before requesting an apology			2
" yeah , that was meant as a humorous joke , " @entity43 said , " and unfortunately humor is sometimes taken the wrong way			2
" @entity24 said the remark could prejudice @entity1 's case and be construed as " biased toward the state of @entity6 " and again asked for an apology			1
i apologize to both of you , " the judge responded			2
" that 's not how i feel about any of you			0
i think you 're doing a great job , and i 've known mr. @entity23 for 25 years			0
" @entity23 said , " just for the record , i did n't take offense to it			0
i 've been called much worse			0
" @entity0 star sitting out @entity1 -- who in 2011 signed a seven - year contract worth more than $ 100 million and is considered one of the @entity82 's best running backs , if not the best -- left the @entity0 last month after the team deactivated , then activated and deactivated him again following accusations that he whipped his 4 - year - old son with a " switch , " or slender tree branch			1
@entity82 commissioner @entity88 told reporters in @entity90 after a lengthy meeting wednesday with the league 's 32 team owners that administering punishment to a player who is waiting for his legal case to move forward after an arrest can be complex			1
" ( the owners ) obviously understand the balance between due process and protecting the integrity of the game , " he said			0
" sometimes that puts you in a difficult position			0
" @entity88 said there was discussion whether or not a new , interim step -- such as paid leave -- should be added to the process			0
the commissioner reiterated that domestic violence and the league 's discipline for violators of its conduct policy are serious issues , ones he discussed with the owners for five hours			1
he said " a majority of our players are great people and men " and said domestic violence is not just an @entity82 issue , it 's a societal issue			1
@entity1 faces up to two years in jail authorities have not divulged details of the case against @entity1 , but photos obtained by @entity132 allegedly show @entity1 's son 's leg covered in marks , some of which appeared to have broken the skin			1
@entity1 turned himself in and was released on a $ 15,000 bond			1
according to @entity6 law , people can be convicted of injury to a child if they cause bodily or mental injury " intentionally , knowingly , recklessly or with criminal negligence " or cause such harm by omission			0
the crime is punishable by up to two years in a state jail and a $ 1,000 fine			0
@entity23 has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like " he experienced as a child growing up in @entity6			0
" @entity1 likewise defended himself , saying he is " not a perfect parent , but i am , without a doubt , not a child abuser			1
" wednesday 's hearing came a day after the @entity158 in @entity159 published a scathing report alleging that the @entity0 turned a blind eye to @entity1 's brushes with the law and moral shortcomings " until suddenly no one could look away			2
" the newspaper also alleges @entity1 engaged in improprieties with one of his charities			2
angry tweets in a series of three tweets that began " @entity173 , " the former @entity175 standout refutes the allegations in 11 bullet points and closes by tweeting , " 10			0
i guess never let the truth get in the way of a good story " and " 11			0
take time to be great and to get it right			0
" after wednesday 's hearing , @entity23 acknowledged recent reports attacking his client 's character and told reporters on the courthouse steps , " there 's always another side , and i hope y'all will start chasing the other side some			1
" asked for the other side , @entity23 responded , " i 'm not going to get into that " and later told reporters , " @entity1 is chomping at the bit to publicly talk and to publicly defend himself , " but has been advised against it by his legal team			1
he went on to describe @entity196 as a " really good man " and asserted , " this is a case about parenting decision and whether something unfortunate happened when a parenting decision was made by a man who believes strongly and loves his children very much			0
" the case wo n't be resolved in the media , he said , adding that the only solution was a speedy trial			0
" i 'm confident that the people here will see that the real @entity1 will be the same before all this ever happened , " @entity23 said before escorting @entity1 to a vehicle waiting in front of the courthouse			1
@entity82 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story '			2
