@entity0 -- a " once - in - a - lifetime " exhibition of paintings and drawings by @entity6 master @entity5 opened in @entity0 wednesday			1
the show , " @entity5 : @entity11 of @entity12 , " at @entity0 's @entity13 includes nine of @entity5 's 15 surviving paintings -- the first time so many of the artist 's paintings have been exhibited together			1
the estimated insurance value of the works on show is $ 2 billion			0
" i think this is maybe a once - in - a - lifetime experience , " said @entity17 , curator of @entity19 painting before 1500 for the @entity13			1
" ( the exhibition ) sort of tops everything , it 's a moment in history really			0
" highlights include the recently rediscovered " @entity25 " and the first version of " @entity27 , " which has never before left the @entity28 , @entity29			1
it is being exhibited opposite the @entity13 's recently restored version of " @entity27			1
" the show focuses on the period of @entity5 's life when he was living and working at the @entity35 in @entity12 as a painter and engineer for the @entity38			1
it was during this time that he produced paintings such as " @entity42 , " " @entity43 , " his first version of " @entity27 , " " @entity45 , " and fresco " @entity46			1
" all of these works , barring " @entity46 " ( which is painted onto the wall of a church in @entity12 ) are on view at the @entity13			2
a copy of " @entity46 , " painted by @entity5 's contemporary @entity53 , is on display			2
it was an important period for @entity5 , says @entity17 , and the exhibition charts his evolution as a painter and thinker			1
he developed his concept of painting as a science , where he equated seeing with perceiving -- a radical idea in the 15th century			0
" ( @entity5 ) thought that the eye and what you could see was the most important way of experiencing the world and that painting could encapsulate all that was visible and invisible in it			0
" ( he 's ) getting closer to the belief that a painter in some ways imitates the mind of @entity76 himself , ( his ) own creativity is akin to god 's creation and it 's a huge leap , " he said			0
it was also during this period that @entity5 became interested in the sciences and especially anatomy , and the many drawings on display show a furious mind , constantly thinking , sketching and pushing at its intellectual limits			2
also on public view for the very first time as a @entity5 painting is the " @entity25 , " displayed alongside preparatory drawings			1
according to art historian @entity96 , " to suddenly have a new painting by @entity5 when he painted so few in the first place is enormously exciting			0
" he added that , despite the painting 's rigorous authentication process , there are still going to be art historians who " will want to go along and see that it 's not by @entity5			0
" to put his work into context , paintings by @entity5 's associates and pupils , including @entity105 ( originally thought to have been the painter of " @entity25 " ) and @entity109 are also included in the show			1
one of the key themes in the exhibition is beauty			0
@entity5 used geometry to refine proportions and adhered to prevalent ideals of beauty in his work , said @entity17			2
the aim was to achieve perfection			0
" @entity5 realized that paintings could make you fall in love , and in order to do that you needed to be amazed by a kind of absolutely essential beauty , " he said			2
" what he 's showing is a painter that can ( not only ) record beauty but create beauty above all , " he continued			0
many of the drawings featured in the " @entity5 -- the @entity134 " are held in the @entity132 : @entity133			0
