-- when strangers hear @entity4 's voice , they ca n't quite place it at first , and then it hits them : " i know you			1
you 've been sending me to sleep for years			1
" for anyone else it would be the greatest insult			0
for 68 - year - old @entity4 , it 's a testament to the very special connection people have with his mellifluous tone , even rhythm , and measured volume			1
it 's a voice pharmaceutical companies could only dream of bottling			2
why the sleepy fanfare ? for over 40 years @entity4 was the man behind one of @entity23 's most cherished -- and baffling -- radio bulletins : the shipping forecast			1
those living outside the @entity23 may never have heard of this broadcasting curio , but sit tight			0
snuggle under the covers , grab a mug of something warm , and prepare to be gently rocked by an ocean far far away			0
and if you still do n't get it , do n't worry too much			2
neither do half the people who listen to it -- that 's its magic			0
" and now , the shipping forecast ... " when @entity40 rolled back the curtains for its @entity43 opening ceremony last year , it took the world on a meandering journey through industrial folk songs , @entity48 anthems , mr @entity50 's piano - playing , and of course -- the shipping forecast			1
" @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , southerly or south easterly , six or seven			0
fair , good ... " what is it ? a sat - nav gone bonkers ? no , it 's the weather conditions of 31 ocean regions around the @entity23 , broadcast four times a day on @entity65			1
first aired in 1924 , the forecast has become both a life - saving bulletin for mariners , and a hypnotic litany of nonsensical seafaring phrases for the rest of us			1
" people listen to it late at night , tucked up in bed , perhaps at the end of a long day , " said @entity4 , who read the forecast from 1969 to 2010			2
" it 's been likened to poetry , to a prayer , it contains a lot of familiar phrases , words and names and places -- it 's very comforting			0
" mysterious muse long before the @entity89 , generations of artists have immortalized this mysterious muse of the air waves			2
@entity93 - winning poet @entity92 , who passed away in august , dedicated a sonnet to the baffling bulletin : " conjured by that strong gale - warning voice , collapse into a sibilant penumbra			2
" while @entity100 tv personality @entity99 had his own tongue - in - cheek rendition : " @entity102 , quite misty , sea sickness			2
not many fish around , come home , veering suggestively			0
" listen to @entity99 's rendition here for such a treasured part of @entity23 culture , perhaps the greatest joy comes from not understanding the shipping forecast at all -- three minutes to let the mind wander among monotonous tones , far flung places , and random numbers			1
@entity117 listener @entity116 was so intrigued by these faceless places , he traveled to all 31 regions and painted what he saw -- often on the deck of a lurching ferry			0
" everybody knows the names of these places but no one knows what it looks like , " said 60 - year - old @entity116 , whose hazy watercolors appear in the book " @entity125 : painting the @entity132			0
" " it 's just a mesmerizing list of places and names			0
so i wanted to be the person to go out there and de-mystify it for them			0
" radio reigns in an era when weather forecasts are only a @entity145 - search away , why do people still tune into this old - fashioned bulletin , arguably the modern equivalent of the @entity150 ? indeed , the forecast has changed little in the last eight decades , following a strict format of 350 words -- sometimes giving it a jumbled sound to the untrained ear			1
" it 's the rhythm of it , " said @entity4 , author of the book " and now the shipping forecast			1
" " it 's the magic of hearing about places you 'll probably never go to			0
" " a lot of people say it feels as though the shipping forecast is speaking to them , and them alone			1
" the last and slightly longer announcement at 12.48am has become renowned for putting night owls to bed , with @entity4 receiving letters from listeners thanking him for his soothing words on restless nights			0
life saver that 's not to say the shipping forecast does n't have an important seafaring function			1
" it all came about because a while back there was such a horrendous loss of life at sea , " said @entity4			2
" people had no idea what the weather was going to be like when they went out on the water			0
" the shipping forecast was brought in , and has saved a lot of people 's lives			1
" for others , it 's a different life - saver , transporting them each night to a watery world on the edge of imagination .			1

ca n't sleep ? never fear , the shipping forecast is here
for almost *90* years , @entity65 's weather forecast has entranced listeners
aired four times a day , the bulletin has been immortalized by artists
life - saver for mariners , helped reduce deaths at sea
