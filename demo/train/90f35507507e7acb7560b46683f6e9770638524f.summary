-- " it 's the hour for us in this country to turn it back toward the @entity4			1
we 're much more than ' hallelujah ' people			2
we 're into government , and we are into politics			2
we are a force to be reckoned with			2
" @entity10 wants his message heard loud and clear : evangelical @entity13 protestants in the @entity14 are more relevant than ever			2
and they 're up for grabs ahead of the 2014 midterm elections			2
one of the leading voices of the fast - growing evangelical protestant latino voting bloc , in the past 14 years as the senior pastor of @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity10 has seen the church grow from " 68 people in one of the worst parts of the nation to over 20,000			1
" last year , he was named one of @entity29 's 100 most influential people in the world			1
" we 're very vocal now , " he said			2
" in the last 10 years , you 've seen this bloc of people has grown			2
and we have tremendous influence			2
" a new study by a nonpartisan research institute based in @entity39 suggests that he 's right			2
the 2013 @entity41 released recently by the @entity42 showed a sharp shift in religious demographics among @entity45			1
it 's that complex religious divide that could be the key to the @entity47 making inroads in the community during the next election cycle			1
" the number of evangelical protestants nearly doubled from 7 % to 13 % when you compare childhood religious affiliation to current religious affiliation , " said the institute 's chief executive officer , @entity51			1
that 's between 7.5 million and 8 million " quintessential swing voters			2
" an ' affinity for the @entity47 ' the door is the most open to @entity47 candidates and the @entity47 , @entity51 said			1
" evangelicals have the most affinity for the @entity47			1
while nearly half lean towards the @entity65 , almost as many lean towards the @entity47 at 43 %			1
" the findings were taken from a random sample survey of 1,563 respondents who identified as @entity71 living in the @entity14 @entity10 -- or " @entity72 , " as he is more commonly known -- believes that evangelical protestants are " what the country needs right now " and could be the key not only for the @entity47 winning big during the midterms , but also for @entity47 to get back to the @entity76			1
" we 've learned from the @entity79 that when the righteous govern , the people rejoice			2
and ( @entity45 ) have n't seen our people rejoice for quite some time , " he said			1
" at the core of evangelicals is the fear of @entity85 and the institution of family			0
these are things we feel we can bring back to this nation			0
" ' we need to do a better job communicating ' latino evangelicals might be ripe for @entity47 influence , but getting them to vote red is a different story			1
@entity96 , president of the @entity97 , said that although the survey gives the @entity47 reason to be hopeful , the party needs to be more proactive within the community			1
" we 've done a bad job of managing our brand			0
we 've let a handful of people in our party , that have made some unfortunate statements , control the party 's message , " @entity96 said			1
the 38 - year - old attorney and lifelong @entity47 said that as the son of @entity118 immigrants , " it 's disappointing as a @entity13 when you hear people making ignorant statements ( in the party )			1
but both sides make ignorant statements			0
i am a leader in the party			1
i have lived the @entity13 culture			0
it 's my job to show the voters and pretty much the entire party that we need to do a better job communicating			1
" he 's talking about statements like this one by @entity47 presidential candidate @entity130 , describing his plan to deal with undocumented immigrants during a 2012 primary debate : " the answer is self - deportation , which is people decide they can do better by going home because they ca n't find work here because they do n't have legal documentation to allow them to work here			1
" " when he said that , i looked over at my wife and said , ' he just lost thousands , if not millions , of us			0
' immigration ... it 's a preeminent issue for us , " said the rev. @entity144 , president of the @entity145			0
a focus on immigration reform much like his friend @entity10 , @entity144 believes that @entity13 evangelicals are the key to victory for any politician			0
nowhere is this more evident than on the issue of immigration reform			0
" evangelicals are coming to a boiling point on this issue			0
we 've prayed about this , held meetings with the @entity76 ; we 've done all we can , " he said from @entity164 , @entity165			0
" let me be clear : we face the issue of immigration every day , as pastors , as caretakers , as @entity45			1
this is on the top of our political agenda			0
it would be disingenuous of me to say it does n't carry heavy electoral gravitas			0
" both @entity144 and @entity10 were advisers to president @entity180 on the immigration issue			0
it 's an area where they feel he 's failed			0
@entity47 have the chance to capitalize on it , according to @entity10			1
" @entity180 flipped on us , " @entity10 said			0
" i traveled for @entity180 for 14 months as a surrogate			0
i talked to the @entity76 , and i said , ' the president can not speak from both sides of his mouth			0
' it 's only right for the @entity47 to say , ' let 's win back this @entity13 bloc , at least the evangelicals			1
' that starts with the immigration issue			0
" the dismal @entity13 turnout for @entity130 was a stark contrast to the momentum developed for years under president @entity199 , who won 44 % of the @entity13 vote in 2004 , compared with the 27 % @entity130 received eight years later			0
after the 2012 election , the @entity47 held a postmortem emphasizing @entity71 outreach , but it 's still unclear how much of a priority republicans have made @entity13 voters			1
at the latest @entity208 , a panel on minority outreach had dismally low attendance			0
disapproval of both parties the @entity41 showed that while there is " dissatisfaction " among @entity13 voters with the @entity65 on issues like record deportation numbers under @entity180 , there is " distrust " of the @entity47 within the @entity13 community			1
" the @entity65 has a less bumpy road ahead , " @entity51 said			0
" the clearest word of caution to @entity65 ... one phrase that is a bellwether question of how well to gauge voters is , ' how well does the party care about people like you ? ' " nearly three in 10 , or 29 % , said " neither party cares about them , " according to the survey			1
" democrats certainly do n't have this community locked down			1
that 's a pretty clear indication that there 's significant dissatisfaction among @entity45 with both parties , " @entity51 said			1
" that 's not necessarily a reason for us to be optimistic			0
we have to be realistic and more proactive , " said @entity241 , president of the @entity242 of @entity243			1
the 31 - year - old said the focus for the @entity97 in winning more @entity13 votes should be on the economy , whether they are courting evangelical protestants or others in the community			1
the figures show that @entity14 - born @entity45 care about the same issues that @entity255 care about			1
right now , that 's jobs and unemployment , " @entity241 said			0
he may be on to something			0
though the issue of immigration reform was ranked high among the concerns of @entity13 voters , it was in a four - way tie for the third most important issue behind the economy and affordable health care , according to @entity42 research			0
@entity96 said the solution to courting more @entity13 voters comes down to the rhetoric			0
" regardless of party , @entity13 will go to the candidate that supports them			2
we 're the party of ( @entity278 ) @entity277 , ( @entity280 ) @entity279 and ( @entity282 ) @entity281			2
our message should be one of inclusion , " @entity96 said			0
the question then becomes , how do they do that ? " these politicians are so full of it to get elected , " @entity10 said			0
" give us someone who is real and speaks the truth and is going to do what they say and mean it			0
we 'll vote for them , whatever party they 're from			2
