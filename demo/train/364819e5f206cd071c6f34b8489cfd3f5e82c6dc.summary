@entity0 -- last night @entity3 's fashion elite gathered at the @entity4 for the 2013 @entity5			0
nominees for the prestigious industry awards included models @entity8 and @entity10 , and designers @entity11 and @entity13			0
trends may come and go , but even among this fashion - conscious crowd there was one certainty : all eyes would be on @entity19			1
the @entity20 honored the 39 - year - old model with a @entity22 for her 25 years in the industry			1
during her glittering career she has appeared on 34 covers of @entity28			2
she 's fronted campaigns for @entity30 and @entity31			0
and she 's remained one of the world 's best - paid models , even as twenty - somethings like @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 have stomped onto the catwalk			2
despite all of those achievements , @entity19 seemed starstruck as she accepted her trophy from @entity42			1
it 's so weird , very very surreal , " she said on stage			0
" thank you everyone who has worked with and kept booking me			0
i am really very grateful			0
" born to a barmaid and a travel agent in @entity52 , south @entity0 , modeling was not an obvious career move			2
but in 1988 @entity55 , the founder of @entity56 , spotted @entity19 at @entity58 's @entity57 , where @entity19 was catching a connecting flight home after a family holiday to the @entity62			1
watch : where have all the black models gone ? standing just 5 ' 7 , her waifish look contrasted sharply with the likes of @entity67 and @entity68 , two of the leggy @entity69 who dominated the runways at the time			0
@entity73 , a @entity0 based portrait artist , shot the first professional pictures of @entity19 later that year			1
he remembers that she offered something fresh and approachable , underlined by a quiet strength			0
" she just had a certain edge in her natural expression and there was a look in her eye in her very first pictures that we are still familiar with today , " he says			0
modeling came easy to her , and @entity73 was able to capture a surprisingly large range of expressions for a model so young			2
she seemed unaware , or at least unmoved , by her prowess , and she lacked the diva qualities so common in aspiring models			2
" she was n't like other girls doing the big ' i am ' , " @entity73 says			0
" she was young , but she had the perfect balance of being cool and collected and warm towards everyone at the same time , which made her very attractive to work with			0
" two years later @entity3 photographer @entity99 shot black - and - white images of @entity102 magazine			1
the fashion press went wild and @entity19 became the poster child of the grunge aesthetic			1
after years of casting glamor girls on the runway , designers gravitated to @entity19 ' ' anti-model ' look			1
in subsequent years @entity19 walked the line between haute and mainstream , appearing in campaigns for a diverse roster of brands including @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , and @entity120 , but also @entity122 and @entity123 cameras			1
in 2003 , she even portrayed a pole dancer in the @entity126 ' music video " @entity127			0
" for reasons photographers , fashionistas and editors do not fully understand , @entity19 's look translates across all demographics , from the luxury consumer to the high - street shopper			1
legendary photographer @entity135 has taken some of the most iconic shots of @entity19			1
as he tells @entity1 : " @entity19 has a unique beauty that is totally democratic and has a universal appeal			1
" that makes her highly bankable			2
@entity141 eventually encouraged @entity19 to leverage her fashion credentials in new areas , and she moved from catwalk to the design chair			1
when she designed a collection for @entity148 in 2007 , the entire range sold out on the first day			0
she went on to design 14 more collections for the store			2
last july , @entity19 's range of " fashion tech " accessories for mobile phones became the fastest - ever selling accessory at @entity156 , a @entity3 high street retailer			1
@entity19 's journey from @entity52 to the runways of @entity159 and @entity160 has not always been easy			1
high - profile romancesâ € ” to @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 € ” fizzled			2
in 2005 , she lost lucrative contracts with @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity166 after @entity3 tabloids reported allegations of drug abuse			2
that fall she voluntarily entered a rehabilitation clinic in @entity171			0
her travails were high - profile , but so was her recovery			2
within a year @entity19 had clawed her way back to the top of the industry , securing a raft of lucrative campaigns			1
her difficulties seemed to endear her to the public even more			0
after rehab she went on to climb the @entity183 list of the world 's highest paid models			0
in an industry defined by physical perfection , vulnerability has its appeal			0
@entity190 , the editor of @entity28 , views @entity19 's success in more straightforward terms			1
" @entity19 has had such a long and successful career as a model because she is sensationally good at it , " she says			1
" she understands what it means to model and i think she enjoys the skill she has in this role			0
i know all my fashion editors and photographers love working with her because of this and also because it 's nearly impossible to take a bad picture of her			0
" in september , @entity207 's auctioned a series of art works inspired by @entity19 for more than $ 2.6 million			1
a three - foot - high glass figurine of @entity19 sold for $ 214,000			1
some might say she is being consigned to history			0
a more generous interpretation is that collectors understand that her value will continue to soar			0
in april @entity19 will launch her 15th line with the retailer			1
do n't call it a comeback			0
as fans of fashion 's most enduring face already know , @entity19 has n't gone anywhere			2
in 2011 : @entity19 's wedding was ' rock - n - roll @entity224 '			1

@entity19 honored for her 25 - year career
photographer says 14 - year - old @entity19 was no diva
model makes even more money after drug *scandal*
