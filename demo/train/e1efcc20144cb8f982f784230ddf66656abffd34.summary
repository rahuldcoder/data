@entity0 -- two iconic teams , each boasting a history and tradition that spans generations , will go head - to - head for club football 's biggest prize on saturday			1
@entity10 , the champions of @entity11 , face @entity12 , the champions of @entity13 , at @entity0 's famous @entity14 for the right to be crowned @entity16 's best			1
these are teams whose exploits inspire emotions and evoke memories that are embedded in the psyche of fans all over the globe			0
but who will triumph in the @entity26 final -- the culmination of a competition that began with qualifying rounds in june last year -- when the two titans clash in front of 86,000 avid supporters and millions more watching around the world ? will it be @entity10 , the home of the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 -- or @entity12 , where football legends @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 are revered ? @entity44 's picks : the @entity46 season in hindsight @entity1 gives you the lowdown on why this match is so special , and why so many neutrals will be tuning in to watch the outcome			1
@entity26 's dream final @entity13 's @entity54 and @entity11 's @entity55 are regarded as the two best leagues in @entity46 football			1
however , only once in 55 previous finals have both countries ' respective champions faced each other			0
@entity10 and @entity12 were also the finalists on that occasion two years ago in @entity64 , with the @entity13 side running out 2 - 0 winners			1
and with only @entity69 champions @entity68 sandwiched between @entity12 ( 79,000 ) and @entity10 ( 75,000 ) in @entity16 's average home attendance table , it means demand for final tickets is almost unprecedented			1
with each club receiving just 25,000 tickets apiece , at prices ranging from $ 490 for the most expensive to $ 245 for the cheapest , never before will so many fans be watching from the comfort of their tv screens			0
@entity26 spokesman @entity79 told @entity1 : " we expect viewing figures to be in excess of 300 million , which will make it the biggest final in the history of the @entity26			1
" the match will be aired in 220 territories by 113 broadcasters , while there will be 180 cameras covering the action , of which 38 will be in high definition			0
" @entity26 has been accused of pricing fans out of attending the match , but the reality is that the ruling body could fill @entity14 three times over because of the support that both teams generate			1
financial fortune a report commissioned by sponsors @entity100 predicts that the winners of the final will enjoy a record economic windfall of around $ 180 million			2
the figure is based on a combination of official prize money , an increase in squad value , enhanced media rights and greater brand equity			0
even the losers will receive in the region of $ 105 million for their efforts			0
professor @entity115 , author of the report , said : " @entity10 versus @entity12 is the dream final as far as most football fans are concerned			1
" but the @entity11 and @entity13 champions are two of the most successful teams off the pitch too			2
they will collectively scoop $ 285 million , making this the most lucrative final in @entity46 club football 's history			1
" @entity115 added : " @entity127 last year listed @entity10 as the most valuable sports brand on the planet , while @entity12 claimed eighth spot in the league table			1
" while the @entity26 is a strong brand in its own right , the nature and strength of the brand is clearly heavily influenced by its constituent parts -- the participating clubs			2
" battle of the giants alongside @entity140 , @entity12 and @entity10 are the two biggest clubs in @entity46 soccer -- with a tradition for playing the game with style and panache			1
such is their popularity , they attract fans from all over the world , not just the @entity150 region of @entity13 or the north - west of @entity11			0
@entity12 have more than 1,300 officially registered supporters ' clubs globally , with estimates that 25 % of the @entity13 population follows @entity12			2
meanwhile , @entity10 have long been recognized as the most supported football team in the world			2
the club 's official @entity158 page became the fastest growing of any sports side in the world , registering almost 2.4 million followers within two months of being set up in july 2010			0
accountancy firm @entity164 recently estimated @entity10 had 75 million fans worldwide , although other estimates have the figure at a mind - blowing 300 million -- largely based on huge income streams from @entity170 , where the club has a massive following			1
@entity10 officially recognize over 200 supporters clubs in 24 countries , with huge swathes of support coming from the south of @entity11 , many miles from the club 's @entity180 roots			2
the 22 players not every soccer fan supports @entity12 or @entity10 , but nearly every follower will be monitoring proceedings on television , radio or the @entity189			1
as well as attracting worldwide support , there will be millions of fans willing either of the teams to lose -- especially in @entity140 and @entity194 , where the bitter rivals of both clubs are based			2
for those neutrals just wanting to watch a game of soccer , a treat could well be in store			0
@entity201 free for @entity26 final this current @entity12 side is being widely touted as the greatest to ever grace club football			1
packed to the brim with players who helped @entity13 win the 2008 @entity208 and 2010 @entity210 final , they also have the best player in the world among their ranks			0
@entity214 forward @entity42 is blessed with remarkable skill , balance and control and the 23 - year - old is following in the footsteps of both @entity220 and compatriot @entity40 in starring for @entity12 while being universally recognized as the number one player on the planet			2
add to the list the attacking talents of @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 , as well as the defensive steel of @entity230 and @entity231 -- the only player on view who has played for both teams after starting his senior career at @entity10 before returning to the @entity236 -- then it 's easy to see why the @entity13 side are favored to win the match			2
under coach @entity240 , already a @entity150 hero for his time as player with the club , @entity12 have won three @entity13 league titles in a row and are on the verge of a second @entity26 title in that period -- a remarkable record			1
@entity10 come into the game on the back of sealing a record 19th domestic league title , a significant achievement as it moved them clear of rivals @entity194			2
they boast the greatest @entity11 player of his generation , striker @entity256 , and golden oldies @entity259 ( 37 ) and goalkeeper @entity261 ( 40 ) -- the latter will be retiring at the end of the match			0
why @entity266 coaches rule @entity11 football but perhaps @entity10 's main hope of halting @entity12 lies with manager @entity269 , who can lay claim to being the greatest coach in soccer history			1
in his 25 years in charge of the club , @entity269 has won 12 league titles and countless other domestic trophies			0
if he leads @entity10 to victory on saturday , he will become the first manager to win three @entity26 titles			1
battle for supremacy the original @entity26 was initiated in 1955 by @entity282 newspaper @entity281 , under the jurisdiction of @entity26			2
although the eventual premise was to involve only teams who had won their domestic league titles , in the early days @entity281 actually invited those teams it considered to have the most fan appeal to participate			0
@entity12 's @entity13 rivals @entity140 dominated in its formative years , taking the trophy in the first five years , while @entity11 clubs dominated from 1976 to 1982 , winning six times in a row courtesy of @entity194 , @entity295 and @entity296			0
the format remained the same until 1992 , when @entity26 created the @entity26 , involving not only domestic champions but also teams who finished second , third and fourth in their respective leagues			1
@entity10 and @entity12 both won the competition once under the old format ( @entity10 in 1968 and @entity12 in 1992 -- ironically both times also at @entity14 )			1
and , since the introduction of the @entity26 , the two teams have maintained identical records , both winning the cup twice and losing in the final once			1
saturday 's match will see one of the teams claim their fourth @entity46 title , overtaking the beaten finalist in the all - time winners ' table			1
the wonder of @entity14 to much national debate , @entity14 , the recognized home of soccer in @entity11 -- the country where the sport originated -- was closed in 2000 , ahead of a controversial proposal to raze it to the ground before building a new arena on the same site			0
football cathedral prepares for final the stadium 's dramatic opening in 1923 set the trend for 77 years of iconic images			0
that year , an estimated crowd of over 200,000 piled in to the newly - built arena to watch the @entity336 final between @entity337 and @entity338 , spilling onto the pitch numerous times only to be dispersed by a policeman on a white horse			0
that initial " @entity348 " proved the prelude for a lifetime of sporting and non-sporting memories that gives @entity14 its legendary status			0
from local hero @entity349 knocking down the greatest heavyweight boxer of them all ( @entity350 in 1963 before he changed his name to @entity350 ) to @entity11 captain @entity353 wiping his muddy hands before accepting the 1966 @entity210 trophy from @entity356 , @entity14 has been at the forefront of @entity11 folklore			0
but perhaps the most famous date in the stadium 's history fell on july 13 , 1985 , when 72,000 music fans attended @entity363 , a 10 - hour concert to raise funds for famine relief in @entity367 which featured some of the biggest names in @entity371 music history coming together on an emotional and unforgettable balmy evening			0
when the new $ 1.3 billion @entity14 finally opened its doors in 2007 , following various legal disputes between its constructors and the @entity375 , seven long years had passed			0
now , four years later , the famous stadium will stage its biggest match since being rebuilt .			0

@entity10 will face @entity12 in the @entity26 final at @entity14
both teams are aiming to become @entity46 champions for the fourth time
the final is a repeat of the 2009 final in @entity64 , when @entity12 triumphed 2 - 0
@entity26 expects viewing figures of over 300 million people worldwide
