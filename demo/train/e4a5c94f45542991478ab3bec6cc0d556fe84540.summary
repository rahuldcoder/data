@entity18 protesters throw darts at an image of @entity21 secretary of state @entity16			1
@entity22 , @entity18 ( @entity3 ) -- secretary of state @entity16 's visit to @entity18 has a dual purpose : convince the @entity18 leadership to hold off on a military intervention into northern @entity28 and bolster @entity18 's confidence in the @entity21			1
both are a tall order			2
warm feelings toward the @entity21 on the streets of @entity18 are in short supply , and the welcome mat is not out for @entity36			1
this week , protesters in @entity38 threw darts at a photograph of @entity36 and held signs that read , " @entity36 , take your bloody hands from @entity18 " and " @entity44			1
" the slogans reflect a growing disgust in @entity18 with the @entity21 for what it sees as a lack of @entity21 support concerning the @entity50 , or @entity50 , separatist rebels in northern @entity28 launching attacks across the border into @entity18			2
in the last month alone , 47 @entity18 have been killed , 35 of them soldiers			0
many @entity18 we 've talked to in @entity22 say they do n't understand why the @entity21 , which has aggressively fought the war against terror , has not been more helpful in dealing the @entity50			1
the @entity50 , they say , is the @entity18 version of @entity59			0
@entity18 feels it has stood by the @entity21 through thick and thin			2
in @entity61 , @entity18 troops are helping keep the peace			0
in eastern @entity18 , @entity63 is used to send 70 percent of air cargo bound for the @entity21 military , as well as about one - third of their fuel			1
@entity18 is trying to help @entity68 and @entity69 end the decades - long conflict and , throughout the @entity71 , it has shared valuable intelligence with the @entity21			1
@entity18 feels betrayed that @entity74 is n't standing by its close friend in its time of need			1
officials tell us they have lost trust in the @entity21 and lost confidence in the @entity21 - @entity18 alliance			1
the relationship between @entity18 and the @entity21 has been deteriorating since the @entity21 invasion of @entity28 in 2003			2
the @entity28 war was so unpopular in @entity18 that parliament denied @entity21 troops access to @entity28 through @entity18 soil			2
in fact , only 9 percent of @entity18 have a favorable opinion of the @entity21 , according to a recent poll by the @entity92			0
@entity21 power of persuasion in @entity18 sank even further last month when a @entity96 committee voted to recognize the deaths of close to 1 million @entity98 by @entity99 in 1915 as genocide			1
even though the full @entity96 did n't vote on the resolution , the incident left a sour taste among @entity18 at a time the @entity21 can least afford such tensions			2
the @entity18 public is strongly urging the government of prime minister @entity107 to send @entity18 forces across the border into @entity28 to get the @entity50 , even if it means further harming the relationship with @entity74			0
the @entity21 is caught in the middle between @entity18 , an important @entity112 ally , the @entity28 government of prime minister @entity114 and the @entity115 , which have provided relative stability in northern @entity28 in an otherwise volatile country			0
@entity74 also wants to avoid @entity119 using the crisis to further leverage in the region			0
@entity119 's foreign minister made a surprise visit to @entity18 this week , signaling that it wants to capitalize on the rift between the @entity21 and @entity18			1
@entity74 has kept a close and skeptical eye on the growing ties between the two countries , especially a deal @entity18 signed last month to buy natural gas from @entity119			1
this weekend at a conference of @entity28 's neighbors and other key @entity133 states , @entity36 will bring @entity18 and @entity28 leaders together in an attempt to forge a plan for dealing with the @entity50			0
the conference was originally planned to address issues about the future of @entity28 and push @entity133 states to support the @entity21 efforts there			0
those issues will be overshadowed by the need avoid a new front in the @entity28 war			0

protesters to @entity36 : " go home "
@entity36 has tall order in trying to bolster @entity99 confidence in @entity21
@entity74 does n't want @entity119 to take *advantage* of souring @entity21 - @entity18 relations
