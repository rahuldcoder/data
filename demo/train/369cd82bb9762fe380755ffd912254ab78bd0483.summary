-- it 's like a stunt from the latest @entity5 movie , only this is n't a movie			1
adorned in a designer suit and sunglasses , a sailor sprints up the 30 - meter mast of a boat as it plows ahead at a 60 - degree angle			1
hopping over ropes and rigging it takes him just 16 seconds to reach the mast 's peak			1
there , he checks himself , removes his sunglasses , pops them in his top pocket and dives into the ocean nine meters below him			2
" it 's the most stupid thing i 've ever done , " is @entity26 's frank assessment of his stunt			1
" it was n't safe at all , " adds the yachtsman more used to solo circumnavigating the globe			0
" only looking back do i really appreciate how dangerous it actually was			0
" the stunt was carried out without a harness , just a water resistant suit , although the risk was reduced thanks to the work of a stunt co-ordinator and two days of preparation on the water			1
for @entity26 's daredevil performance to succeed he also needed a wind speed of exactly 18 to 20 knots and for the boat to be traveling at 10 knots ( a little under 20 kph )			1
the 37 - year - old and his team began their search for the perfect wind speed in @entity51 , @entity52 , but were forced to switch to @entity53 in southern @entity54 because conditions were n't right before eventually shifting to @entity56 where the stunt was eventually performed			1
" at the end of the first day , i had to sit down on shore and calm down , " says @entity26			1
" i was appreciating perhaps it was n't safe at all , and there were some hairy moments when we were practicing			0
i remember one time i was halfway up when the boat suddenly tacked and i was just left hanging from the mast			1
" obviously falling from that height from the mast onto the deck is n't advisable , " he quips			2
" the ramifications would n't have been great			0
" on the day itself , with stunning skies above , the stunt went pretty much perfectly , which had a lot to do with the man driving the boat , @entity75			1
" his was the harder , more nerve wracking job as he had to keep the boat just right , " says @entity26			1
" @entity75 works for me and he 's a good mate so obviously he was conscious he did n't want things to go wrong			2
" i 'm not sure if he was relieved come the end of it but he was certainly happy man with how it went			0
" as for @entity26 's starring role in the escapade , he 's conscious that he came very close to really hurting himself			1
" now the top of a mast is n't really designed for a man to dive off but i went for it and it held up , " says the yachtsman			2
" as for the dive itself , i slightly over-egged			0
there was some quite impressive editing work on that as i landed head first very close to my back			0
" it was quite close to a back belly flop and , while i would n't have killed myself , i certainly would have had some nasty internal injuries			0
" diving wise , i 'd always wanted to dive but was n't sure until i got to the top whether i 'd have the guts to do it			2
" i 'd been up a 10 - meter board at a pool in training but never dived off it			2
so this was a first and , once i was up there , i sort of thought i might as well go for it			0
" as he pondered that stomach - churning dive , @entity26 says he felt surprisingly calm			1
" as a sailor i 'm used to hoisting myself up the mast and you get well versed at reading the wind and the waves so i was quite aware if there was suddenly going to be a change in the boat 's course , " he explains			1
there was n't , he duly hit the water and quickly returned to the surface to the relief and cheers of his team			0
even now , @entity26 , who has a penchant for being something of a daredevil , is not entirely sure why he performed the stunt			1
" i did a keel walk a while ago and we did a video for that , which got over two million people watching which i was flabbergasted by , " he admits			0
" so we got talking about doing something else and this seemed a bit of fun really			0
" i 'd taken to running up the mast -- although not necessarily to the top -- for a while , mostly when entertaining people on the boat to , say , take pictures of them on the deck			1
" so , going the whole way up and jumping off seemed a good idea			2
" it 's a bit like the @entity153 ( the race to circumnavigate the globe )			0
you sort of agree to it not thinking it will necessarily happen , and then suddenly the day comes for it			0
" having done a keel walk two years ago and now a mast walk , @entity160 is at a loss to consider what might complete a hat - trick of sailing stunts			2
" that was the same after the keel walk			0
i 'd never planned to follow that or do something like this , it just happened			0
so when i 'm asked what i might do next , i literally have no idea			0
