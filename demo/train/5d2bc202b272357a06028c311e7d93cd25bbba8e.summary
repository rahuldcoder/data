@entity0 -- in the hours after two explosions ripped through @entity5 just feet from the finish line of monday 's @entity7 , people across the city rallied around each other , showing , as one runner said , " the human spirit is still alive			1
" at a @entity13 across from the @entity14 , a hotel filled with out - of - town marathoners , manager @entity11 and his staff set up an impromptu feeding table offering free coffee and pastries to anyone walking by			1
the idea was sparked by a woman in @entity22 who called the store and offered to donate $ 100 worth of coffee and pastries to people affected by the bombing			1
" i was shocked , " @entity11 said			1
" i thought it was an organization			1
i thought it was @entity13 corporate			1
it turned out to be just some citizen who wanted to find somewhere close and be a helping hand			1
" ' @entity0 will overcome , ' mayor vows technically , the store was closed			1
train station closures made it difficult for staff to get to work and police barricades made it virtually impossible for customers to enter			1
but @entity11 and his management team opened the store on their own time to feed and caffeinate passersby			1
" instead of doing a little bit of what we had , we 're doing everything that we had in the store based on what @entity13 wants to contribute and based on her contribution as well , " @entity11 said			1
those enjoying the shop 's offerings included many of the thousands of runners who were stopped short of finishing the race			1
wearing running gear or branded @entity7 jackets , many wandered up to police barricades where early in the day volunteers checked bib numbers and handed out finishing medals			1
@entity68 and @entity69 flew from @entity70 , @entity71 , to run the marathon , but were stopped just short of the finish line when the bombs went off			1
when the police diverted the two men away from the buses that carried their personal belongings , they were wearing only running clothes			1
" it was freezing , " @entity68 said			1
" but many people came out of their houses , some of them were filming us , but many of them were offering water , many of them were offering jackets			2
we both had pants and a jacket that were given to us just ' cause those people felt that we were in the need of some support			2
" what we know about the bombings so far after walking for hours they eventually made it back to their hotel , but they did n't receive their marathon medals			1
when the pair left their hotel on tuesday to explore the city , they met a man who told them they could collect their medals at a police checkpoint on @entity112			1
one of the women at the checkpoint hanging medals around runners ' necks was volunteer @entity118 from @entity119 , @entity120			1
@entity118 had n't planned on being a part of the marathon			2
an employee of @entity124 , @entity118 had come to @entity0 on monday afternoon to attend a corporate training class on tuesday			2
" my hotel room looked out over everything that happened , " said @entity118 , who was checking into her room just as the bombs exploded			2
" i just could n't go to class today			2
i just could n't focus and so i decided to walk around until i found a place that needed a volunteer			2
" a police detective eventually directed @entity134 to the offices of the @entity136 , where she was handed a marathon jacket and led to a police barricade			2
there , @entity118 spent the morning greeting and hugging runners who had been affected by the bombing			2
" i 've seen every emotion , " @entity118 said			2
" i 've seen men cry			2
i saw a man who did n't want to take a medal because he did n't feel he deserved it			2
" one runner told @entity118 he was a military veteran who had served time in @entity149 as a medic			0
" he did n't have his ( bib ) number because it was covered in blood and he threw it away , " @entity118 said			0
" he went to help people and he was totally covered in blood , " @entity118 said , recounting his story			0
" he had his bag but he did n't have a medal , and he did n't think he was going to get one and when i gave it to him he cried			0
" how you can help by noon on tuesday , the city 's response efforts had become more organized , and the @entity136 began directing all runners in search of closure in the form of finishing medals to the @entity171 on @entity172			1
hundreds of runners streamed in and out of the @entity171 , where the city had set up a makeshift resource center for those scattered by the blasts			1
@entity178 wiped tears from her eyes as she emerged with a medal around her neck			0
" i was crossing the finish line and about to receive my medal right when the bomb went off , " said @entity183 , who flew in from @entity184 to run her first @entity7			0
" i heard the explosion and right when the guy was about to hand me my medal he said , ' that 's not supposed to happen			0
' " she rushed away from the finish line with no cell phone and no money in search of the two friends she had coaxed into running alongside her			0
after a fall ended their race , @entity183 's friends jumped ahead to cheer her on at a restaurant near the finish line			1
" they were one table left of the blast			0
where they were sitting , if i would 've passed 10 seconds later , they would 've been in the blast , because they got up to leave and the blast went off , " @entity183 said			1
" and that 's where ground zero was , and the dead bodies and the blood			0
" after waiting for more than an hour at the family waiting area , she made her way back to her room at the @entity223 just in time to grab her purse and cell phone before the building was evacuated			0
during the evacuation a man stranded outside his hotel with nothing came up to her to ask for help			1
doctors remove ball bearings from victims " i gave him $ 20 , " @entity183 said			0
" he e-mailed me last night and he said , ' i 'm going to repay you			0
' i said , do n't even worry about it			0
it 's just the human spirit			0
i know anybody would 've done the same thing for me			0
i 've never felt so helpless just not having any money , i do n't even know the city			0
it 's just amazing how everybody came together			0
" until the finish , @entity183 said the race was the best she marathon had ever run			1
" i was coming through the finish line and hitting people 's hands , " @entity183 said			0
" i stopped and had a beer on mile 22			0
it was so great and so electric			0
" despite being visibly shaken by her experience on monday , she vowed she 'll be back			0
" i 'm not going to let them scare me away , " @entity183 said			0
" that 's what they want			0
i 'm going to come back			0
" we 've been hit before on home soil @entity0 heroes : running to help map of the explosion sites bombing is the latest @entity270 tragedy			0
