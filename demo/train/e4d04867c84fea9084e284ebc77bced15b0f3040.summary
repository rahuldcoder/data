@entity0 -- the @entity2 sought saturday to tamp down rumors involving sex , money and gay priests that have been swirling in the @entity8 media and have been linked by some to pope @entity11 's decision to resign			1
the strongly - worded denial came on the eve of the pope 's last angelus blessing , expected to draw huge crowds of the faithful , before he stands down on thursday			2
@entity2 secretary of state @entity18 said it was " deplorable " that as the time for the @entity21 cardinals to elect a new pope approaches , a rash of " often unverified , unverifiable or completely false news stories " has appeared			1
such unfounded stories " cause serious damage to persons and institutions , " he said , and are an attempt to influence the cardinals ' free will in the election " through public opinion			0
" opinion : there 's more to the @entity21 than the pope @entity18 did not address the specific claims that were first published in @entity38 , the country 's largest circulation daily newspaper , on thursday and friday			1
the newspaper stories center on an investigation last year by three cardinals into a scandal involving leaks from the @entity2			1
@entity38 , citing unnamed sources familiar with the investigation , alleged that the investigation revealed a series of scandals involving sex , money and power that touch cardinals , priests and lay people that work in the @entity2			1
@entity2 spokesman the rev. @entity57 declined to comment on @entity38 's article in a media briefing on thursday			1
@entity61 @entity2 analyst @entity60 , also a correspondent with the @entity62 , suggested in a piece written friday that unsourced speculation about a shadowy " gay lobby " within the @entity2 should be taken with a grain of salt			1
but , he said , while he does n't know for sure if the three cardinals did investigate networks based on sexual orientation , " frankly , it would be a little surprising if they had n't " -- given past scandals that have become public concerning clergy involved in homosexual activities			0
the pope may well have been worn down by the " cumulative impact of the various meltdowns over the last eight years , " @entity60 said			0
" however , " he added , " it 's probably a stretch to draw a straight line between all of this and @entity11 's resignation			0
for the most part , one has to take the pope at his word : he 's stepping aside because he 's old and tired , not because of any particular crisis			0
" the pontiff will leave office at 8 p.m. on february 28 , two - and - a - half weeks after he shocked the @entity21 world by announcing his resignation			0
the @entity2 has said a new pope will be in place for the @entity21 's @entity93 celebrations on march 31			2
@entity11 on saturday concluded a week - long spiritual retreat , held to mark the @entity96 period			0
addressing the clergy who had joined him , he thanked them " not only for this week , but for these past eight years that you have carried with me -- with great skill , affection , love and faith -- the weight of the @entity107 ministry , " referring to the papacy			0
@entity11 also met with @entity8 president @entity109 on saturday , an encounter described by the @entity2 as " particularly warm and cordial			1
" facts about pope @entity11 the pontiff is considering changing the @entity2 constitution to allow a vote for his successor to begin before march 15 , @entity57 said wednesday			1
existing rules say the @entity21 's cardinals should start voting on a replacement from 15 to 20 days after the papal throne becomes vacant			0
with @entity11 due to depart on february 28 , the cardinals ' conclave ordinarily would start no sooner than march 15			0
but @entity57 has said that because @entity11 was leaving the papacy through resignation rather than death , the @entity2 would explore the possibility of selecting a new pope sooner than normally prescribed			1
the so - called " @entity129 " scandal last year led to the pope 's butler , @entity129 , being convicted on charges of leaking private papers from the @entity2 in a high - profile trial and sentenced to 18 months in prison			2
although @entity129 was pardoned weeks later by the pope , the whole affair -- which revealed claims of corruption in the church 's hierarchy -- was damaging to the @entity2 's reputation			2
the latest media allegations , despite the strenuous @entity2 denials , may add to the pressure for reform			2
@entity1 's @entity146 and @entity147 reported from @entity0 , and @entity148 wrote from @entity149 .			0
