@entity0 -- a sharply divided @entity2 narrowly passed a @entity4 - backed climate change bill friday after hours of cajoling and arm - twisting by @entity7 leaders among members worried about the legislation 's potential economic and political fallout			1
the @entity2 passes an energy bill that includes a " cap - and - trade " program on emissions			1
the bill passed 219 - 212 , with virtually no @entity16 support			1
the bill would reduce nationwide greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a so - called " cap - and - trade " program under which companies would buy and sell emissions credits			1
among other things , the bill would also require utilities to generate an increasing amount of power from renewable sources			2
even before daybreak friday , consternation over the bill brewed anew			2
the @entity7 released a 301 - page amendment to the bill at 3:09 a.m. friday , drawing protest from @entity16 leader @entity30 , @entity31			1
" this is the biggest job - killing bill that has ever been on the floor of the @entity2			1
this bill , " @entity30 said			2
the leaders of the @entity4 are customarily granted unlimited speaking time , but when the @entity30 's speech went more than 2Â½ hours , @entity7 objected			1
" is this an attempt to try to get some people to leave on a close vote ? " asked rep @entity38 , @entity40 , the bill 's lead sponsor			0
also friday , the @entity2 phone switchboard went down as conservative radio hosts and congressmen made direct pleas for voters to dial the @entity51 to voice their opposition to the bill			0
" phone traffic has increased to a level where some callers are receiving an ' all circuits are busy now , please try back again later ' message , " communications director @entity54 said via e-mail			0
congressional sources said @entity7 were hoping their constituents would also attempt to match phone calls opposed to the bill with phone calls for the bill			1
" call your congressman , right now ! " urged rep. @entity65 , @entity66 , from the @entity4 floor as the chamber seemed near a vote			0
@entity54 said the bill was likely behind the phone - line crash			2
" the suspected cause ... is believed to be interest and inquiries regarding the expected vote on the climate bill , " he wrote			0
the @entity4 vote came one day after president @entity79 made an urgent plea for congressional approval in what could be an early make - or - break test of his young administration			1
" now is the time for us to lead , " @entity79 said during an appearance thursday in the @entity86			2
" we can not be afraid of the future			0
we can not be prisoners to the past			0
" the president said the bill will spark a " clean energy transformation " of the @entity96 economy and " make possible the creation of millions of new jobs			0
" " make no mistake , " he emphasized			0
" this is a jobs bill			0
" several moderate and conservative @entity7 indicated that they received heavy constituent pressure in the final hours to buck their party leadership and vote against the bill			1
" i ca n't begin to tell you how many calls we 've received , " said rep. @entity104 , @entity105			0
" and it 's disproportionately vote ' no. ' " @entity104 , who voted " yes , " believes special interest groups generated many of the calls on both sides , including the late surge of negative feedback			0
however , @entity104 also said @entity79 tried to counter much of that pressure by personally reaching out to swing members since thursday night			2
@entity16 have argued the bill would have the unintended consequence of devastating the country 's battered industrial base while pushing polluting industries to countries with lower environmental standards			1
having cleared the @entity4 , the bill now faces an unclear future in the @entity127 , where @entity7 leaders have held off on introducing their own version of the legislation			1
@entity1 's @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 leaders , @entity79 twist arms to get politically dicey bill passed
@entity138 would reduce nationwide greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020
@entity16 says bill would drive polluting companies to less - regulated countries
@entity138 faces unclear future in @entity127 , where it has not been introduced
