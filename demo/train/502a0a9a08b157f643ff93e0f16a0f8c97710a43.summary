@entity0 -- the recent visit by @entity4 prime minister @entity3 to @entity5 primarily focused on @entity7 's nuclear program -- a long way from previous meetings that had , more often than not , focused on @entity4 - @entity11 relations			1
there is little talk about a peace process these days			0
the @entity17 , as it 's known in the region , was initially greeted with hope and optimism by @entity11 but has since given way to diminished hopes for a negotiated two - state solution			1
for @entity11 watching today 's @entity24 - @entity4 dynamic from the sidelines , their disappointment with @entity24 president @entity27 following his speech on sunday to @entity30 lobbying group @entity29 is palpable			2
in that speech , @entity27 reiterated @entity24 support for the jewish state as it faces of concerns about @entity7			0
" i have heard the comments among @entity11 about whether president @entity27 is president of @entity4 or @entity38 ... i found his language during his @entity29 speech as demeaning and dangerous , " said veteran @entity11 politician @entity43 , before adding that the @entity24 president was , in her view , shielding @entity4 in a personal way			0
the continued building of @entity4 settlements in the @entity49 , combined with moribund @entity24 - backed peace talks , has resulted in @entity11 political strategy becoming about survival and dependence			1
" the @entity11 have lost the initiative , " says dr. @entity54 , head of the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) , a @entity11 research and analysis center in @entity0			0
" for the first time @entity11 are depending on external factors [ to make progress ]			0
" to that end , they have been following several tracks : the recent @entity64 - sponsored talks with @entity4 ; reconciliation efforts sponsored by @entity66 between the @entity11 political factions @entity67 and @entity68 ; aid and reconstruction efforts by the @entity71 ; and focusing on @entity7 influence on @entity67			1
@entity43 agreed : " the @entity11 can not deliver freedom on our own and we are not going to go back to the armed struggle suddenly , but at the same time you want to maintain global support for @entity11 and self determination and human rights			0
" the @entity17 has prompted @entity67 in @entity80 to change course too			1
it has begun moving tentatively toward a more political form of @entity84			0
" @entity67 is for the first time is saying civil state , democratic state , pluralistic state and this is a revolution in their thinking , " said dr. @entity54			0
as a result -- and to the extreme annoyance of @entity4 and the @entity24 -- divisions between @entity80 - based @entity67 , which is viewed as a terrorist organization by those countries , and the @entity49 - based @entity68 are being papered over amid attempts to form a unity government			1
" it 's difficult to say whether @entity67 and @entity68 can work together but if we set up a system where pluralism and differences of opinion can be expressed peacefully , they should be able to work together , " said dr. @entity43			2
and in a significant break with @entity109 president @entity108 , @entity67 in @entity80 recently announced support for the @entity109 people in their uprising			1
in doing so , @entity67 distanced itself not only from @entity109 , but from @entity7 -- @entity109 's staunch ally and @entity67 's key financial backer -- and more closely aligned itself with its ideological bedfellows in @entity66 , the @entity116 -- a group that made major headway in @entity66 elections following the revolution there			1
regional changes may have given a new impetus to @entity67 and @entity68 on the reconciliation front , but as dr. @entity43 puts it , recent meetings between the two groups in @entity66 show that while they are trying to work together , " like all political parties self interest comes into play			2
" in the absence of any progress towards either statehood or reconciliation , @entity11 objectives have become primarily focused on the short term : buying time to prevent a total breakdown in communication and trying to prevent a breakout of violence among @entity11 -- and with @entity4 .			2

' @entity17 ' initially greeted with hope and optimism by @entity11
@entity80 - based @entity67 and @entity49 - based @entity68 are trying to form a unity government .
@entity67 has distanced itself from @entity109 -- and by proxy , @entity7 -- in wake of @entity17
