in his zeal to promote nuclear power , filmmaker @entity0 inserted numerous half - truths and less - than - half - truths in his new documentary " @entity7 , " which @entity6 is airing on november 7			1
one of @entity0 's more misleading allegations was that scientists at a @entity11 research facility , the @entity12 , were on the verge of developing a breakthrough technology that could solve nuclear power 's numerous problems when the @entity18 administration and its allies in @entity20 shut the program in 1994 for purely political reasons			0
like the story of @entity24 itself , the tale of the integral fast reactor ( @entity27 ) -- or at least the version presented in the movie -- is more myth than reality			1
in the final assessment , the concept 's drawbacks greatly outweighed its advantages			0
the government had sound reasons to stanch the flow of taxpayer dollars to a costly , flawed project that also was undermining @entity11 efforts to reduce the risks of nuclear terrorism and proliferation around the world			0
read what @entity0 has to say in the film , scientists who worked on the @entity27 program unsurprisingly sing its praises			0
for example , @entity51 , a former program manager , claimed that the reactor " ca n't melt down " and would therefore be immune to the type of catastrophes that occurred at @entity56 in 1979 and @entity57 in 2011			1
others told @entity0 that the reactor , by " recycling " its own used , or " spent , " fuel , would conserve uranium resources and produce much less nuclear waste than conventional reactors			0
but the reactor 's advocates did n't tell the whole story , and @entity0 did not include anyone in the film who could have provided a more balanced and realistic assessment			2
what did " @entity7 " leave out ? first , it does not clearly explain what a " fast reactor " is and how it differs from the water - cooled reactors in use today			1
most operating reactors use a type of fuel called " low - enriched " uranium , which can not be used directly to make a nuclear weapon and poses a low security risk			2
the spent fuel from these water - cooled reactors contains weapon - usable plutonium as a byproduct , but it is very hard to make into a bomb because it is mixed with uranium and highly radioactive fission products			1
fast reactors , on the other hand , are far more dangerous because they typically require fuels made from plutonium or " highly enriched " uranium that can be used to make nuclear weapons			1
in fact , fast reactors can be operated as " breeders " that produce more plutonium than they consume			1
to produce the large quantities of plutonium needed to fuel fast reactors , spent fuel from conventional reactors has to be reprocessed -- chemically processed to separate plutonium from the other constituents			1
facilities that produce plutonium fuel must have strong protections against diversion and theft			2
all too often , however , security at such facilities is inadequate			0
in the @entity27 concept , which was never actually realized in practice , reactor - spent fuel would be reprocessed using a technology called pyroprocessing , and the extracted plutonium would be fabricated into new fuel			2
@entity27 advocates have long asserted that pyroprocessing is not a proliferation risk because the plutonium it separates is not completely purified			0
but a 2008 @entity11 @entity127 review -- which confirmed many previous studies -- concluded that pyroprocessing and similar technologies would " greatly reduce barriers to theft , misuse or further processing , even without separation of pure plutonium			1
" see the @entity127 review here ( @entity138 ) other @entity127 studies showed that pyroprocessing , by generating large quantities of low - level nuclear waste and contaminated uranium , greatly increases the volume of nuclear waste requiring disposal , contradicting " @entity7 's " claim it would reduce the amount of waste			1
see @entity150 fact sheet ( @entity138 ) and what about @entity51 's claim that the ifr ca n't melt down ? it 's false			1
" @entity7 " referenced two successful safety tests conducted in 1986 at a small demonstration fast reactor in @entity156 called the @entity157 ( @entity157 )			1
but @entity157 operators scripted these tests to ensure the desired outcome , a luxury not available in the real world			0
meanwhile , the @entity157 's predecessor , the @entity164 , had a partial fuel meltdown in 1955 , and a similar reactor , @entity167 1 near @entity168 , had a partial fuel meltdown in 1966			0
see @entity11 @entity127 information posted by the @entity171 ( @entity138 ) moreover , fast reactors have inherent instabilities that make them far more dangerous than light - water reactors under certain accident conditions , conditions that were studiously avoided in the 1986 dog - and - pony show at @entity180 - @entity179 perhaps the biggest myth in the film is the notion that all @entity11 research on fast reactors was terminated			1
in fact , the @entity186 's demise was a shutdown in name only			0
the @entity127 has continued to fund research and development on fast reactor technology to the tune of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars a year			0
the @entity196 in @entity156 shown in the film -- in reality , a plant called the @entity198 -- has been operating for decades , essentially as a jobs program , to reprocess spent fuel from the now - defunct @entity157 , despite the system 's serious problems			2
in 2000 , the @entity127 promised that all the fuel would be processed by around 2007			0
three years later , it delayed the projected completion date to 2030			0
@entity51 's assertion in " @entity7 " that " we know how to do these things " does not square with the difficulties the @entity127 has encountered in trying to operate this troubled plant			2
but if @entity6 viewers are persuaded by the " @entity27 sales pitch and think the federal government should throw even more good taxpayer money after bad , i have two words of advice : caveat emptor .			0

scientist : " @entity7 " offers " half - truths " promoting integral fast reactors
government : @entity223 cut " barriers to theft , misuse " of plutonium , which is used for weapons
film falsely says @entity223 ca n't melt down , says @entity231 of the @entity150
