@entity0 -- just days after a magnitude 5.8 earthquake cracked the @entity6 in four places , the @entity3 is trying to protect it from being further damaged by @entity9 , spokeswoman @entity2 said friday			1
engineers for the @entity3 are working inside the @entity6 to " plug holes and catch anything that they ca n't plug , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
" we have a group of people who are on ropes up there , trying to pin and plug whatever they can			0
" the engineers are using a flexible insulation called backer rod			1
" they are basically jamming it into the cracks , " @entity2 said			2
" they are doing what they can and putting this backer rod in and then they are going to go back up and inspect after the storm , " she added			0
one area of special concern -- the most extensive damage to the stonework near the top caused by tuesday 's earthquake			1
" the crack is about 4 feet long and 1 inch wide and in some places wider and you can see sunlight through the crack , " @entity2 said			0
the monument is closed indefinitely to the public while engineers assess the damage caused by the quake			1
even without the new cracks , the monument would have experienced seepage because of the way it was built , according to @entity2			1
" the anticipation is there will be more water because of these cracks			2
these cracks allow the water to get directly through and that is why we are doing everything we can to put in temporary waterproofing , " @entity2 said			0
however , the water is not expected to compromise the stability of the structure , she said			0
the first rain bands from @entity9 began hitting the @entity63 and @entity64 coasts friday			1
