-- a 30 - meter - turbine anchored to the seafloor off the @entity4 coast is proving that tidal farms are a turn closer to being a viable renewable energy source			1
@entity8 completed preliminary trials of the giant undersea turbine in the fast - flowing coastal waters off the @entity12			0
it found that the turbine produced one megawatt of electricity , enough to power 500 homes and businesses			1
" we 're very pleased with the initial results and we 've operated at full power already , " says @entity18 , head of innovation at @entity20			1
if the next stage of testing goes according to plan , @entity18 says that work will soon begin on a fleet of the turbines -- manufactured by @entity30 -- and will be installed at another site in the @entity32 off the west coast of @entity4			1
although there are examples of similar stand - alone operations in @entity39 and the @entity40 , the sound of @entity32 turbines would be the first large group of its kind anywhere in the world			2
when fully operational it is estimated to produce electricity for 5,000 homes			2
other countries with strong tidal resources and potential sites for tidal power farms include @entity51 , @entity52 , the @entity53 and @entity54			2
compared to offshore wind farms , tidal energy devices like the turbine trialed in @entity4 are completely hidden from view			1
they are criticized for being potentially harmful to marine life , but @entity18 contends that because the turbine 's propellers move relatively slowly , the impact on fish and other forms of sea life is minimal			0
see also : @entity68 's oceans are ' plasticized ' @entity8 says that it already has planning consent and a lease for the seabed where the tidal farm will be built			0
however the main obstacle to the implementation of more tidal farms remains the cost			0
" we have publicly stated that we expect the capital costs of the @entity32 project to be around Â £ 70 million ( $ 110 million ) , " says @entity18 , which equates to roughly $ 11 million per turbine			0
the 10 megawatts of power that will be generated by the @entity32 turbine farm pales into insignificance when compared to the output of a large nuclear or coal power station , which according to @entity53 hydro energy non-profit the @entity89 , can produce up to 100 times as much electricity			1
@entity18 is quick to point out that he believes such challenges are inevitable in developing new technologies and that costs would fall and efficiencies improve as the fledgling industry develops			0
" the estimate for the @entity40 in terms of wave and tidal is that it could eventually produce in excess of 10 % of the country 's electricity requirements , " says @entity18			2
" that 's definitely big enough to make it of interest for us to pursue it			0

@entity20 has *successfully* tested a new type of **underwater** tidal turbine
the device can produce 1 megawatt of electricity , enough to power 500 homes and businesses
a fleet of ten **underwater** turbines could be installed off the @entity119 of @entity4
this would be the first sub sea turbine farm anywhere in the world
