@entity0 -- they were partners - in - crime for more than two decades : reputed mob boss @entity6 and his henchman , @entity5			1
in the course of three days on the witness stand in @entity6 's federal trial , @entity5 has described in great detail the murders he says he witnessed @entity6 commit and he has portrayed himself as a lackey following orders and getting rid of physical evidence -- pulling victims ' teeth to avoid identification and disposing of bodies			1
on tuesday , @entity6 's lawyer , @entity20 , tried to reverse the image and portray @entity5 as a man who knew how to kill people independently of @entity6			1
he focused in on @entity5 's common - law stepdaughter @entity24			1
not only did @entity5 molest her when she was 17 ( an act flemmi maintains happened twice and was consensual ) , he also lured her to her death at age 26 after first taking her shopping			2
" that murder could have been prevented by one word from @entity6 , " @entity5 said			1
" all he had to say was p - a - s - s , pass			0
i would have been happy			0
" @entity5 testified he watched and did nothing as @entity6 strangled the troubled girl with his bare hands			2
after she was dead @entity5 removed her beige sweater , pulled - out her teeth as he had done with other victims to thwart identification of bodies , and then buried her in a basement floor , he testified			0
juror weeps as witness in @entity6 trial details strangling death of woman " you murdered your stepdaughter , " @entity20 charged			1
" in the eyes of the law , yes , " @entity5 responded , " but physically no. " @entity6 's lawyer then continued to portray @entity5 as a pedophile , whose actions contributed to his stepdaughter 's drug addiction			1
@entity5 became unnerved , pointing at @entity6 who sat just eight feet away , snapping , " you want to talk about pedophilia , right over there at that table			2
" he then referenced a trip @entity6 made to @entity64 with a 16 - year - old - girlfriend			0
lawyers for @entity6 , who is charged with 19 murders , extortion and racketeering , also questioned @entity5 about the murder of @entity5 's girlfriend , @entity71			1
@entity5 said in earlier testimony that @entity6 strangled the 26 - year - old beauty because she knew the name of a rogue @entity77 agent who had recruited @entity6 and @entity5 to work as informants			2
" in @entity6 's eyes that was a serious offense , " @entity5 testified			1
it 's ' @entity6 ' vs. ' @entity82 ' as @entity6 defense goes for top prosecution @entity20 asked about dinner meetings @entity5 had with @entity86 at @entity5 's parents ' home and wondered why they were n't killed			1
@entity5 called the question " ridiculous " and said , " all my mother knew was how to cook and she was a very good cook			0
she did n't know @entity86 from a hole in the wall			0
" @entity6 's lawyer pointed out @entity94 was murdered after @entity5 learned she was involved with another man			1
and he tried pointing out inconsistencies in @entity5 's prior testimony about exactly where the woman died in the house she had been lured to , upstairs or after @entity5 and @entity6 carried her to the basement			1
shot by shot testimony makes jurors squirm " i 'm not a doctor			0
she looked dead to me			0
she was dead , " said @entity5 , who testified earlier that @entity6 strangled @entity94 upstairs			2
he also said her death was " such a distasteful act , it 's a guilt trip i 've been on all these years			0
" in an attempt to show @entity5 was his own man , @entity20 led @entity5 through a series of murders and crimes he committed before he met @entity6			2
@entity5 contended as part of a criminal gang , he could n't back out or say ' no ' once the gang had made a decision			0
" you do n't understand the underworld at all , " @entity5 hissed at @entity6 's lawyer			1
" you do n't know nothing			0
that 's the real world			0
that 's the world i was involved in			0
" the trial resumes wednesday with @entity5 still on the stand			2
