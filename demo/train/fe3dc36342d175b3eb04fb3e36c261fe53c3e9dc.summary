these are good times for anti-smoking campaigners			0
but you would n't know it from listening to their rhetoric			0
at the urging of anti-tobacco activists , the @entity7 is proposing to ban electronic cigarette use aboard aircraft			1
this impending regulation not only defies medical evidence but makes a mockery of the law in the process			0
the use of e-cigarettes among @entity20 adults more than doubled between 2010 and 2013 , according to the @entity21			2
the tobacco industry predicts e-cigarette sales will surpass traditional cigarettes in the coming decades			0
this signals great progress from a harm - reduction standpoint , since the best available scientific evidence suggests that while e-cigarettes may bring health risks , they are far smaller than those associated with tobacco smoking			1
yet , anti-tobacco campaigners are increasingly agitating for strict rules against e-cigarette use , perversely threatening advances in public health			1
the risks associated with e-cigarettes are borne exclusively by the users , not the people around them			2
unlike tobacco cigarettes , vaporizers do not produce harmful " sidestream " emissions -- the smoke released directly into the air from the end of lit cigarettes , which produces 85 % of secondhand smoke and virtually all of its associated risks			0
as for the " mainstream " smoke inhaled by smokers , many of its harmful compounds are partially retained within the smoker 's body , which acts as a filter before it is exhaled into the surrounding air			0
there is simply no evidence that secondhand aerosols exhaled by e-cigarette users endanger non-users			0
as dr. @entity72 , a former co-chair of the @entity73 of the @entity74 , said , " [ @entity68 ] here is no public health justification for banning e-cigarette use in no - smoking areas			1
" anti-tobacco activists who disingenuously equate vapor and tobacco smoke may perversely convince smokers to reject far safer e-cigarette alternatives			0
consumers should not be misled to believe e-cigarettes , which do not produce tobacco smoke and its many concentrated toxins , pose the same risks as smoked tobacco			2
to be sure , airlines should be free to ban e-cigarettes aboard their aircraft if they so choose			1
but just like the use of cell phones on planes ( or a passenger 's odoriferous perfume , for that matter ) , the risks posed by e-cigarettes do not justify federal regulation			1
in 2011 , the @entity7 initiated a regulatory proceeding to reinterpret " smoke " and " smoking , " in order to extend the existing federal ban on in - flight smoking to e-cigarettes			1
now years delayed , the department quietly indicated in mid-january that it plans to finally issue a rule by the end of april to prohibit e-cigarette use aboard aircraft			0
such an action runs counter to congressional intent and constitutes an illegal expansion of regulatory power			0
the @entity113 states that @entity115 ' intent in prohibiting smoking in the skies was to " improve air quality within the aircraft , reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers , and enhance aviation safety and passenger comfort			2
" the law was intended to address secondhand smoke , and the department concedes " a vapor , rather than smoke , is produced			0
" so how does the @entity7 justify its proposal ? by noting , that e-cigarettes " require an inhalation and exhalation similar to smoking cigarettes			1
" so , by @entity113 's logic , when @entity115 referred to " smoke " and " smoking , " it meant anything that might vaguely resemble smoke and smoking , rather than smoke itself and its resulting harms , even though @entity115 enacted a clear law in which the terms " smoke " and " smoking " are not ambiguous			0
the @entity7 has no authority to regulate vaping , an area over which it has no jurisdiction			1
it may claim that it is simply interpreting " smoking " to cover the use of e-cigarettes , but as the @entity160 has made it clear , an " agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction " by stretching the language of a statute			2
regardless of one 's views on whether airlines should permit e-cigarette use on their flights or not , the @entity7 's attempt to rewrite a law passed by @entity115 is an unlawful abuse of power			1
the looming in - flight e-cigarette ban has far more to do with pushing a nanny - state agenda than promoting illusory public health benefits .			1

@entity7 has a proposal to ban e-cigarettes in planes
@entity179 : this has more to do with pushing a nanny - state agenda than promoting public health benefits
