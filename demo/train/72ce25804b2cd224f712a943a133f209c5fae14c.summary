the latest round of peace talks with the @entity2 remains the @entity5 government 's best bet not just to solve the country 's 29 - year old " @entity7 problem " but also to feed its energy - hungry population and wean it off costly and politically risky @entity11 and @entity12 energy imports			1
to cope with a fast - growing economy and an increasing demand for energy , @entity5 must ensure an adequate energy supply			1
so far , its power generation has largely relied on @entity11 and @entity12 imports			2
the @entity21 crisis , however , has created a rift between @entity5 and these energy suppliers , leaving the @entity5 economy vulnerable to regional dynamics and price shocks			1
to fuel its growing economy and reduce its account deficit driven by high prices of oil and gas , @entity5 has been scrambling to find alternative energy resources			1
to that end , the @entity5 government has quietly been building up its energy presence in the @entity37 's ( @entity37 ) oil and gas industry			1
on march 25 , @entity5 prime minister @entity38 and @entity37 prime minister @entity39 negotiated a framework deal that included @entity5 stakes in exploration blocks and terms for the direct pipeline export of oil and gas from the @entity37			2
the pipeline will allow @entity7 crude oil to be transported from the @entity37 directly into @entity5 , bypassing @entity48 and setting up the @entity37 as a competitive supplier of oil to @entity5			1
in an effort to stave off political tension with @entity48 and @entity54 , the parties did not sign a government - to - government deal ; instead , they turned the @entity37 energy portfolio over to public and private energy companies			0
in the spring of this year , @entity5 established a state - backed firm to explore for oil and gas in northern @entity60			1
in january , @entity61 , an @entity63 - @entity5 exploration and production company , was awarded the right to ship oil directly from the area			2
since then , the company has been exporting crude oil from the @entity37 's @entity70 fields to @entity5 's @entity72 port by truck			2
the amount of oil exported from @entity70 will grow significantly when the construction of the pipeline is completed by the end of this year			0
the @entity37 's gas resources are even more appealing to @entity5			2
in 2012 , @entity5 's daily gas demand was 125 million cubic meters ; this figure is likely to double this winter			2
as such , @entity5 is expected to be one of @entity85 's biggest gas consumers in a decade			2
@entity7 gas is attractive to @entity5 because the framework agreement between @entity5 and the @entity37 includes specific terms on the price of gas			1
@entity5 thus has leverage over pricing			0
some experts have said the @entity37 's supplies could be three times cheaper than @entity11 and @entity12 sources due to this leverage			1
this energy cooperation between the @entity37 and @entity5 has been expanding rapidly			2
about a dozen @entity5 companies have applied to @entity5 's energy watchdog to obtain licenses to import gas from and construct oil pipelines in the @entity37 , and the @entity37 recently granted six @entity5 companies permission to explore for oil			1
last month , news leaked that a @entity5 company was issued a license to import natural gas directly from the @entity37			0
the @entity5 state company @entity110 has also started construction of a gas pipeline from the @entity37 to @entity5 's southeastern city of @entity114			1
through this energy partnership , @entity5 can secure an alternative low - cost supplier and realize @entity38 's goal of promoting @entity5 as an energy hub , and the @entity37 can ensure its economic independence from @entity48			1
but the success of the @entity5 - @entity37 energy partnership hinges on the peaceful resolution of @entity5 's @entity7 problem			1
the @entity2 has used pipeline attacks as a means of targeting @entity5 's strategic assets			0
until very recently , @entity2 attacks on pipelines knocked out oil and gas flows , forcing @entity5 to buy @entity11 and @entity133 gas at higher prices and keeping the @entity60 - @entity5 route mostly idle			1
in order to assure pipeline security and investment confidence , @entity5 must finish what it started a year ago			0
in an effort to end three decades of fighting between @entity5 and the @entity2 , @entity5 intelligence started negotiations with the imprisoned @entity2 leader , @entity144 , in 2012			0
as part of settlement talks , the @entity2 declared a ceasefire in march 2013 and started its withdrawal from @entity5 toward its camps in northern @entity60 in may			1
no serious fighting has been reported since , but that could change			0
last month , the @entity2 announced that it halted its pull - out as both sides accused each other of failing to respect their part of the deal			0
late last month , the @entity5 government unveiled a reform package that allows the use of @entity7 language in election campaigns , lifts restrictions on the use of the @entity7 language in private schools , abolishes the requirement to recite the pledge of allegiance that forced schoolchildren to declare that " i am a @entity170 , " and allows @entity7 towns to use their @entity7 names			2
for the @entity7 , however , the reform package seems to only move forward halfway			0
@entity7 have long asked for the right to public education in @entity7 , and the package only applies to private schools			0
the democratization package also does not offer concrete steps to address the @entity7 demand to lower the 10 per cent electoral threshold , which has mainly been used to keep @entity183 parties out of parliament			0
after the announcement , the @entity2 warned that it may end the unilateral ceasefire			0
after a visit by @entity7 politicians to the prison island of @entity191 where @entity144 has been held since 1999 , the @entity7 leader also relayed a message asking the government to lay the legal groundwork to address all @entity7 demands or risk a breakdown in talks			0
but for the @entity5 government , there is no easy way forward			0
with the 2014 local and presidential elections looming and no end in sight for the @entity21 civil war , political uncertainty seems guaranteed			0
in the highly charged pre-election atmosphere , the @entity5 government has to operate such that it does not alienate nationalists while at the same time keeps the peace process moving			0
yet the bigger challenge facing @entity5 decision - makers is the regional fallout from the war in @entity21			1
@entity5 media is reporting that in retaliation to @entity5 's stance in @entity21 , @entity12 intelligence has been talking to the @entity2 leadership in northern @entity60 's @entity217 to convince it to abandon the peace process , promising support for @entity7 demands for autonomy in northern @entity21 in return			1
for @entity5 , the stakes are higher than ever			0
finding a peaceful resolution to its @entity7 problem will not only remove a strategic vulnerability ; it will also ensure a less costly and politically less risky energy alternative to @entity11 and @entity12 and will realize @entity38 's dream of making @entity5 one of the world 's ten largest economies by 2023 â€” the hundredth anniversary of the @entity5 .			1

@entity21 's war has created rift between @entity5 and energy suppliers @entity12 and @entity11
@entity5 negotiating deals with @entity7 energy firms to fill fuel gap
@entity5 has also established state - backed firm to explore for oil and gas in northern @entity60
