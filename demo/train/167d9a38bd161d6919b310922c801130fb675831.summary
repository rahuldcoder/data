-- on monday , @entity2 mayor @entity1 announced changes in the way police will deal with people caught with small amounts of marijuana			1
now police officers will no longer arrest anyone caught with less than 25 grams of pot. instead , they will issue a summons to appear in court			1
@entity15 hopes this policy will spare young people the burden of a criminal conviction			2
" a summons will not affect their future			0
an arrest could , " @entity1 said at a news conference			1
@entity15 's plan sounds like a significant step away from @entity2 's controversial " stop and frisk " policies , the kind of policing @entity1 campaigned against when he ran as a progressive candidate for mayor			1
but upon closer examination , @entity1 's policy does n't seem so progressive			1
at best , it is a well - meaning baby step toward more effective law enforcement			0
at worst , it is a policy that ignores the racial disparities in marijuana arrests -- and one that might have unintended consequences for the people it is trying to help			0
one troubling aspect of @entity1 's new policy is that it does not address the issue of who will be stopped for minor marijuana possession			1
according to the @entity52 , an advocacy group aimed at easing drug laws , in the first eight months of this year , 86 % of those arrested for possessing small amounts of pot in @entity2 were @entity53 ( by comparison , the @entity46 shows that slightly over half of the city 's population is african - american and @entity59 )			1
so while young people of color may avoid being taken to jail for pot possession , it is still overwhelmingly likely that it will be young people of color who find themselves with a summons for possession			2
@entity15 's plan also holds worrisome implications for due process			1
previously , after a person was arrested , the prosecutor 's office would review the case and decide whether to pursue it			0
under the new policy , this crucial step is circumvented			0
a person who is given a ticket for minor pot possession must appear in a courtroom , even if their arrest was legally questionable			2
@entity86 district attorney @entity85 told the @entity87 that allowing police to write tickets without oversight raised " a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without safeguards currently in place			0
" and if people miss their court dates , they could still face warrants for their arrest			2
what 's more , @entity100 officers will retain wide discretion under @entity1 's new policy			2
police officers will be allowed to make a judgment call on whether to issue a summons or arrest a person			0
that seems awfully trusting of a police department that has not only been cited for unconstitutional racial profiling , but one that also has aggressively ramped up marijuana enforcement efforts			0
consider that marijuana - related arrests under @entity1 are on par with those of his predecessor , @entity116			0
@entity15 can not remake the law on marijuana ; that is up to the @entity120			0
yet what if he were to take a bold stance in favor of marijuana decriminalization ? this could spark the same types of discussions that ultimately led voters in @entity129 and @entity130 to legalize pot. with the @entity133 reporting that public support for marijuana legalization is at an all - time high , the mayor of @entity2 should be out in front of this debate			1
at the very least , @entity1 should make clear to his police commissioner that he expects the @entity100 to move away from law enforcement techniques that led the @entity2 @entity140 to declare @entity2 " the nation 's marijuana arrest capital			1
" @entity15 's new marijuana policy should be seen only as a down payment on long overdue @entity100 reforms			2
as a national figure representing a new generation of progressive leadership , he owes all @entity2 his full commitment to equal outcomes under the law .			0

@entity153 : @entity2 mayor de @entity1 says cops wo n't arrest someone with small amount of pot
they **'ll** get summons instead . it 's good step , but does n't address racial aspects of stops , he says
@entity153 : new rule requires court appearance . @entity170 it , and there **'ll** be arrest warrant . this a flaw
@entity153 : @entity15 , show your progressivism . take bold stance in favor of pot decriminalization
