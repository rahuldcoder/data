-- for all of our post- 2012 election talk about the changing culture , the changing demographics and , perhaps , a changing party , preliminary thoughts out of @entity7 about the 2016 election have us headed toward not much change at all : @entity10 vs @entity11 ... again			1
i am as intrigued by the prospects of these two juggernauts , @entity15 and @entity16 , locking ideological horns as i am repulsed by the thought of half of my life being dominated by two family names			1
@entity22 , @entity10 , has risen from the ashes after the @entity24			2
the other name , @entity11 , is so toxic that the past two @entity27 nominees avoided saying it in public , opting instead to skip their combined 12 years in office and head straight back to @entity31			1
face it , @entity16 has baggage , but @entity15 has @entity11 , and that , moreso than his record as governor of @entity36 or ideas for the future , will determine , at least at the beginning , how he is received			1
that explains why more than a few conservatives were not thrilled to hear that he was thinking of running			0
is it fair for a 59 - year - old man to be judged by the actions , or inaction , of his father and brother ? of course not			1
and we certainly would n't judge @entity16 solely based on our opinion of @entity53			0
yet , as we know , politics is a lot of things but fair is not one of them			0
i can already see some super pac funded by -- oh , that 's right , they do n't have to tell us -- creating ads morphing @entity11 into @entity63 and then @entity15 , with a @entity65 voiceover saying , " same name , same failed policies			1
" politics : @entity15 hopes dad will run for president that would be great for @entity10 , or whoever eventually claims the @entity74 nomination , but not necessarily good for the country			1
it 's not a good thing for the country when voters are robbed of the opportunity to hear smart ideas for superficial reasons			0
like @entity84 's infamous yelp or @entity86 's quiet demeanor			0
and in my book , discounting the idea of a candidate because of his brother 's shortcomings is superficial			0
if someone does n't like @entity15 , let it be because of the record of @entity15 , not because of the record of everyone in the @entity24 named @entity11			1
there are things i like about @entity15 and things i do n't , but both are based upon what he has done			2
and if we want an election based upon substance instead of that @entity27 primary circus we had in 2011 , that is how we need to judge both @entity10 and @entity11			1
assuming , of course , it is @entity10 and @entity11			1
the speculation is here , but the reality is years away , and a lot can happen			0
politics : behind the scenes of @entity10 's " shuttle diplomacy " @entity15 may not find the conservative support he needs because many view him as a rino ( @entity27 in name only ) while @entity16 says she 's tired			1
( and i 'm sure she is ... tired of not being president			0
) we heard a lot of talk about change after this year 's election			1
the biggest change that 's needed is a move away from hyperbolic reactions to inconsequential events			2
in august 1988 , @entity15 's father , in a brief meeting with president @entity31 , introduced three of his grandchildren to the @entity135 this way : " these are @entity138 's kids from @entity36 , the little brown ones			2
" call me crazy , but i doubt at any point in @entity15 's life would he introduce his children to anyone as " the little brown ones			2
" this is n't to paint the father as anything scandalous but to make the point that @entity15 is his own person , with his own thoughts and own ideas			2
earlier this year , @entity15 spoke his own mind , calling the rhetoric during the @entity27 primary disturbing and saying that his party was behaving stupidly with regard to @entity155 voters			0
i do n't recall his brother or dad being that bold in criticizing his own party			0
@entity15 deserves to be credited , or discredited , on his own merit , not on the record of the men who served as president before him			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			0

@entity165 : for all the talk of change , 2016 may be another @entity11 - @entity10 race
@entity11 name carries *negatives* ; so toxic that @entity174 and @entity175 avoided it , he says
@entity178 : it 's not fair to judge @entity15 by the actions of @entity11 , @entity63
he says we should examine the *potential* candidates on their merits , not family names
