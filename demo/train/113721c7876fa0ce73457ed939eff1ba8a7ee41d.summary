if the bill is signed into law , 13 people could be executed in @entity3 this year			2

" we have more sophisticated juries today , a higher demand for forensic evidence , " said @entity39 , " so i do n't believe that keeping people around who have confessed to the crime , who were n't claiming their innocence , really serves the state that well			2
" the " @entity16 " would mandate the governor sign death warrants in capital cases within 30 days after the @entity3 @entity51 has completed its review			1
this is after the federal courts rule and the governor completes clemency proceedings , @entity39 said			0
the bill states that executions are to take place within 180 days of a death warrant being signed			2

@entity39 said the bill will " enhance the deterrent factor of the death penalty , " it will be a " tremendous help to victim 's families " and it will cut down stays on death row to " below 10 years			1
" this bill has nothing to do with justice but more to do with politics , said @entity85 , executive director of the @entity3 @entity86			0
