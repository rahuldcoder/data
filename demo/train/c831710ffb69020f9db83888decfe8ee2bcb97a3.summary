@entity3 had called her 6 - 2 6 - 0 reverse in round - robin group play wednesday " embarrassing " and she set about putting the record straight in the title match			1
fourth - ranked @entity2 began where she left off to take an early 2 - 1 lead with a break of service , but this was a very different @entity3 on the other side of the net			1
the world number one immediately broke back and a further break to lead 5 - 3 was the start of eight games in a row without reply			1
a total of 26 winners flowed from the racket of the 33 - year - old @entity32 veteran -- who was winning the end of season crown for the third straight year -- the first player since @entity37 in 1992 to achieve the feat. " she was playing so well at the beginning and i told myself to just relax and once i did that i started playing better and making my shots , " @entity3 told the official @entity7 website			1
" i lost to her a couple of days ago so i knew she was capable of playing really well , but i knew i had to play better if i wanted to win			0
@entity3 ' participation in the @entity7 had been in doubt after she pulled out of a warmup tournament in @entity49 with a knee injury			2
" i was n't even sure if i 'd be able to play here and now i 've won the @entity52 again -- it 's an amazing feeling , " she added			0
her triumph caps an unpredictable year for the 18 - time grand slam champion , who won the @entity57 crown last month , but made shock exits from the other three majors			0
she closed out the match with another empathic winner after just 69 minutes and picked up a check for just over $ 2 million for her efforts			0
@entity2 was the first @entity5 to reach the final and only the eighth woman to achieve the feat while making her debut in the event for the top eight players of the year			2
the 23 - year - old said she always expected @entity3 to rebound after the earlier match			1
" she was more motivated and more focused maybe in this match , and she tried to hit the balls very strong , " @entity2 told gathered reporters			2
