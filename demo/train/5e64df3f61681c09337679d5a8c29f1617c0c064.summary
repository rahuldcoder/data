-- a few days ago , a sportswriter friend of mine posted on his @entity4 page a picture of a child - sized athletic t - shirt with the words " destined to be drafted " printed on front			2
he commented , " just in case anybody thought youth sports culture is n't getting outta hand			1
" @entity15 's child sex abuse allegations : in his own words on the same day , my home state @entity17 , recently scandalized by the professional and personal improprieties of former football coach @entity21 , introduced their new uniforms with a 1,300 - word press release complete with a quote from a freshman player saying , " i like to look good , so when i was being recruited the uniforms definitely had something to do with my interest in a school			1
" what does any of this have to do with the abhorrent actions of which @entity15 is accused ? @entity15 is one individual being tried for very specific crimes , sexually abusing young boys			1
but in the midst of this scandal , it 's hard to not also indict the culture that coddled him			2
college football is one of our national obsessions			1
we get so wrapped up with the thrills of the games			2
what we overlook is that like any big - time college sport , it perpetuates the fantasy , which the fans and media readily buy into , that its players are still kids and its coaches are moral leaders			1
in other organizations or institutions that have dealt with horrible scandals of sexual abuse -- like the @entity58 and the @entity59 -- their leaders actually have some claims to moral and civic authority			2
but why have we granted moral authority to college coaches ? it 's partly because we all idolize winners			1
winning games gives coaches a cloak of invincibility			1
they are considered " first citizens , " as ancient @entity73 called its emperors , rather than citizens first			0
they seem immune to the rules that apply to the rest of us			0
it 's easy to think they can do no harm			0
for that reason , we excuse them when they throw tantrums , which we interpret as being " passionate			0
" in any other profession , those tantrums would result in being fired			0
where the head football coach is the highest paid state employee , it 's no wonder that a sense of proportion has gone out the window			2
in @entity97 , for example , six of the top 10 salaried state employees are in the state university 's athletic department			0
under this culture of adulation , someone like @entity15 is more likely to get a pass for questionable behavior			1
no one could have conceived of him as being anything other than an upright molder of men , even if there were signs to the contrary			0
those who come into contact with him are more likely to look the other way than to scrutinize anything unusual			0
opinion : in @entity15 trial , a second act for @entity121 ? at the same time that we elevate the coaches to a pedestal , we infantilize the college athletes			1
whenever i hear announcers refer to " these kids " on a team -- while in the context of a police report or a voting booth or a battlefield death , an 18 - year - old would be a " man " -- i have to shake my head			0
to the athletic programs , they are essentially low - wage workers with high school degrees in a big business			2
the sooner we abandon the pretension that all players are student athletes and that coaches are role models for men , the sooner we can regain a sense of reality			0
that said , there 's plenty of room for athletes to be students and vice versa			0
there also are many good coaches out there who would make strong mentors to kids of all ages			0
but let 's not pretend that coaches are on a higher moral ground just because they are heading a winning team			1
if we see coaches as real people rather than heroes , then we can regain a healthy dose of skepticism			0
maybe then toddler t - shirt messages will go back to being appropriate for the age and a college sports team 's uniform wo n't matter as much			1
' @entity174 ' describe seduction , betrayal @entity15 trial : all you need to know @entity15 case drawing to a rapid close the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 : @entity15 was coddled by the culture of college football
@entity183 : big - time college sports feed us fantasy that coaches are moral leaders
he says winning games gives coaches a cloak of invincibility
@entity183 : @entity15 *escaped* scrutiny because we put him on a pedestal
