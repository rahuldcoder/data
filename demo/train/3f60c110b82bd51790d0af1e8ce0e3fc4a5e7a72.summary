@entity0 -- airline passengers who spent 11 hours stuck on the tarmac at @entity4 were unloaded tuesday afternoon in the latest example of the frustrating effects of a massive blizzard that delayed thousands of would - be holiday travelers			1
the airport , airline and government officials engaged in finger - pointing over delays on the tarmac			1
" there were a lot of people on the plane crying , " said passenger @entity14			1
" it was really a tough situation			0
" she called the situation " just a bad judgment call			0
" " they kept trying to get us to go , and they kept us on the plane with no choice , " @entity24 said			0
travelers aboard the @entity32 flight from @entity33 , @entity34 , arrived in @entity0 at 2:12 a.m. et on tuesday			1
they got off the plane shortly after 1 p.m. et. " it was n't fun with three children sitting there , " said passenger @entity35			1
" no one has admitted to making any mistakes			0
" at some point , @entity35 said , there was even talk of a ladder being brought out to the runway , but that did not happen			0
the airline told him it may be at least 48 hours before the family gets its luggage , he said			2
passenger @entity50 told " @entity55 " that the crew did a good job but could n't provide answers on what would happen			1
@entity32 spokesman @entity56 said the airline 's intention was " to get passengers to @entity0 as quickly as possible , and we anticipated to have gate space available			2
" he said the gate typically assigned to the airline had been moved " because of what became a very fluid situation at @entity4 due to the weather			1
" four international flights were stranded at @entity4 on tuesday without gates available to unload passengers , officials said			1
" we also had four flights come into @entity73 , but because they were domestic flights we were able to get them off , " said @entity71 spokesman @entity70			0
@entity70 said that because the @entity4 flights were international , they had to be unloaded in specific customs areas to undergo screening			1
" there is just no place that you can dump 1,000 people in a secured area for a period of time , " @entity70 said			2
he said the planes were stranded because the airlines brought them in without checking with terminal operations to see if there was a place to put them			2
the airline 's website advised passengers on other flights scheduled for tuesday to check for confirmed departure times before traveling to the airport			2
a @entity98 spokesman also blamed a lack of gate space for the seven - hour stranding of its passengers on a flight from @entity104			1
@entity106 's @entity105 landed at @entity4 from @entity107 at 1:15 a.m. , more than two hours behind schedule , but passenger @entity109 said it was six hours before he could walk off the plane			1
" we were running out of food and water and the pilot came on to say he had been arguing with the folks at the airport to at least let the police come on board to deliver some food and water , " @entity109 said			0
" and i guess he lost that fight -- nobody came on			0
" the airport keeps buses ready to help remove passengers from planes stranded on the tarmacs , " but sometimes the airlines do n't inform us , " said @entity70			1
the @entity106 jet pulled up to a gate after several hours on the tarmac , but the doors stayed closed until 7 a.m. et , @entity109 said			1
" apparently , what happened was the @entity134 folks went home at 1 a.m. and so everybody coming international kind of had to sit out there in the snow all night , " he said			2
" it 's possible " the lack of a customs staff caused the deplaning delays for international flights , @entity70 said , " and that 's why we have to look into the whole situation			0
" " it might have been a situation where too many planes came in with not enough gate space for them , " @entity70 said			0
however , a @entity134 spokesman in @entity0 said those reports were incorrect			0
" at no point were @entity134 officials sent home , " spokesman @entity155 said			0
" for flights arriving after midnight , there is usually one terminal available which is always staffed with @entity134 officers , " said @entity155			0
he said @entity134 officials have been taking multiple shifts to ensure ample staffing , noting that agency has no involvement in passengers deplaning or the removal of their cargo			2
@entity155 said it is the responsibility of the airlines to notify @entity134 officials when arriving at @entity4			1
the fourth international flight stuck on the tarmac was another @entity32 flight , according to the @entity71 , but it was not known where that flight originated or how long it was stranded			1
for the passengers who were able to deplane after several hours , some had more frustration ahead -- they were informed they could not access their luggage			2
@entity181 , a passenger aboard the @entity106 flight , said " most people were calm " as they waited inside the plane			1
" but once we got out , people were more upset because there were no bags , " he said			0
@entity190 arrived in @entity0 a few minutes early monday night , but it took seven hours before a gate was opened " due to the weather - related problems they have been having lately , " an airline spokesman said tuesday morning			0
" we fully apologize to customers for this delay , but it is outside our control what parking stands we are allocated , " said the @entity98 spokesman			0
on the @entity106 plane , @entity109 credited flight attendants for keeping their composure			0
" they were actually quite nice and pleasant and had a smile on the face throughout the whole ordeal , " he said			0
passengers on several other flights also posted @entity212 messages complaining they were stuck on the tarmac at @entity4 overnight			1
the @entity209 @entity214 , which prohibits airlines from letting passengers stay on grounded planes for more than three hours , does n't apply in these situations			1
@entity219 , executive director of @entity220 , said the rule does n't apply to international flights			2
@entity1 's @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
