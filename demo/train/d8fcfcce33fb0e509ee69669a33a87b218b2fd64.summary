a sudden tragedy brings out the best in the media : journalists racing to the scene , ferreting out the details , leading the nation through its grief			1
it also brings out the worst			2
in the fragmentary accounts that followed friday 's horrifying massacre at a @entity12 school , some news organizations , following in the tracks of social media , managed to identify the wrong man as the shooter			1
and then television provided a platform for the instantaneous finger - pointing and point - scoring that all too often follows such shootings			2
i am conflicted when i watch the instant network specials , led by top anchors and featuring theme music and fancy logos , as i did after @entity28 , after @entity29 , after @entity30 , after @entity31			0
of course they want to devote time and resources to a major national story			1
but it also feels at times like a branding exercise , an effort to grab ratings share after a heartbreaking event			1
i am conflicted as well at watching some journalists interview children who saw the carnage			0
i understand their value as eyewitnesses , but these are young kids who had just been through a terrible trauma			0
to me , at least , it feels exploitative			0
some organizations , including @entity50 , require the parents ' permission , but it is not clear that all outlets followed such a policy in the scramble that followed the shootings			0
i was not conflicted at all when i read that a @entity59 reporter called the shooter 's grandmother in @entity62			1
" i just do n't know , and i ca n't make a comment right now , " @entity63 , 78 , said in a shaky voice as she started to cry			0
i fail to see what that added to our understanding of the tragedy			1
watch : @entity71 , media critic , takes on @entity72 the worst offense , though , was the headlong rush to identify the shooter as @entity76 , 24 , and blast his @entity78 profile picture around cyberspace			1
@entity50 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , the @entity84 and others named @entity76 as the suspect , some of them based on guidance from law enforcement sources			0
in this wired age , his name was bandied about on @entity92 and in other social media forums			1
the news outlets had to correct their reports when it turned out that the shooter was 20 - year - old @entity98 , his brother , who first killed their mother			1
but they had suggested that an innocent man was responsible for murdering 27 people , including 20 children			1
what 's more , most reports erroneously said @entity76 's mother taught at the @entity110 elementary school ( a mistake i initially repeated as well )			1
watch : from @entity113 to @entity114 , the conservative media meltdown blogger @entity116 , who teaches journalism at the @entity119 , expressed regret for retweeting information about @entity76 , although @entity116 did not use his name : " i did not say this was the ' alleged ' or ' reputed ' account of the person named as the killer			2
these are basic , basic journalistic skills drilled until they are reflexes and i would use them in any story for print			2
i did n't use them online			0
" not everyone was as candid in confessing their mistakes			2
the rush to judgment is hardly an isolated incident			0
after an @entity136 gunman last year killed six people and wounded @entity138 , some news organizations erroneously reported that the congresswoman was dead			0
after the @entity31 shooting this past summer in a theater showing a @entity145 movie , @entity142 's @entity141 told viewers the suspect was linked to the @entity149 tea party before apologizing for reporting on someone with the same name			0
watch : is ' @entity153 ' tortured history or propaganda ? after friday 's violence , there was an instinct by some in the media to pound away at their favorite positions			2
@entity161 said on @entity80 : " we ask why there is violence in our schools , but we 've systematically removed @entity165 from our schools			0
" i respect the former @entity169 governor , but friday did not seem like the time for such a statement			0
at the same time , @entity114 ripped @entity81 's @entity171 and @entity50 's @entity172 for saying the massacre pointed up the need for stricter gun control			1
" you 've got a horrible event here , and they 're already looking to politicize it			0
... these people look at stuff like this as an opportunity to advance their agenda or blame conservatives			0
" ( the three guns , including an assault rifle , used by @entity98 were legally registered to his mother			0
) all this is reminiscent of what happened to @entity192 's @entity191 when he used a halftime commentary to question the gun culture in this country after an @entity197 player was involved in a murder - suicide			2
@entity191 was attacked from the right for daring to inject a serious issue into a sporting event			2
watch : the media fixate on @entity203 and 2016 , again except in the days following a mass shooting , the media seem to shy away from a serious debate over gun control , perhaps fearing that it is too divisive and will alienate a broad swath of readers and viewers			1
the mainstream press operates under the assumption that @entity214 will never pass a gun - control measure because of the @entity217 's clout and therefore the matter is n't much worth pursuing			1
the issue was barely mentioned in the presidential campaign , and journalists made no attempt to force it onto the national agenda			1
the same thing will happen after @entity110 inevitably fades from the newscasts and the front pages , and the gun question disappears until the next big tragedy forces us to revisit it once again			1
follow @ @entity231 on twitter			0

@entity234 says media rightly rushed to report the story of the vast tragedy in @entity110
he says the wrong man was identified as the shooter , and other mistakes were made
@entity234 : story *deserves* intense reportage , but did media go too far with branding ?
he says gun control *flares* up as a topic after these events , but media *rarely* pushes the issue
