@entity0 is mapping out a possible presidential run , creating a narrative , talking to fundraisers and looking to change his image from the senator who once ran @entity7 's budget office to the @entity8 from @entity9 with a serious resume			1
" i probably have more experience than other people who are running or thinking about running , " he said			2
the first - term senator and policy wonk could run as a sort of @entity8 -- a swing state pragmatist with a loaded resume			1
@entity0 certainly would n't run as an outsider			1
he embraces his previous @entity21 experience having worked for both @entity7 administrations			1
he went so far as to point out his executive branch background is both foreign and domestic			2
he traveled overseas as counsel to the 41st president and later served as the @entity26 under the 43rd			2
he worked in the legislative affairs office of the elder @entity7 and was budget director for his son , developing relationships on @entity31 that span decades			2
his experience could also make a bid difficult in a @entity35 primary			2
@entity0 ran the @entity21 budget office in t years when tax cuts and war spending spun up government spending and added to growing deficits			1
but his time in @entity42 is certainly a not - so - subtle counterpoint to that of president @entity45 , who clocked just two years , a month and six days in @entity42 before announcing his intention to run it -- and the country			1
following president @entity45 's " flash , " as some @entity0 confidants describe it , the @entity9 would be the prototype of substance and competence			1
next to hostility -- witness @entity55 gov. @entity54 shouting " sit down and shut up " to a heckler just before @entity57 -- @entity0 offers civility			1
@entity59 , the general manager of the @entity0 family restaurant , @entity62 @entity9 's @entity61 , gushes about how nice the senator is , saying he has " a servant 's heart			1
" for the last few weeks , he says his diners have been buzzing , " @entity67 gon na be the president ? " unknown purveyors of conventional wisdom in @entity42 do n't dispute his qualifications or likability , but they dismiss the 58 - year - old @entity74 lawyer as not electrifying enough to galvanize voters across the country			1
supporters say he could be a foil to @entity45			2
but they have also worked to alter the " boring " perception by sending @entity0 out to kayak and bike - ride in some of his recent media interviews			1
( he agreed to lunch on the lip - smacking ribs with this @entity86 reporter			2
) perceptions can be a problem , but voters have to know you exist			0
@entity0 acknowledges that gaining attention would be his first obstacle			1
" i 'd be an asterisk in the polls , " he said , adding that the national primary debates are his only chance to prove himself			0
debates could be key for @entity0			1
he was considered a top - notch stand - in twice for president @entity45 , as well as @entity99 and @entity100 in debate prep during the last four presidential elections			2
@entity0 says he has a national network of donors that could keep his campaign afloat until debate season arrives			1
the downside is the @entity108 has already pledged to limit the number of sanctioned debates			0
it was n't lost on @entity0 's boosters that one of his contemporaries at the @entity115 , @entity54 , took a victory lap the morning after the election by appearing on all five of the network morning shows to claim credit for a @entity115 romp of statehouses coast - to - coast			1
@entity0 , too , has connections nationwide			1
wearing one of @entity128 's infamous @entity127 bibs in front of a plate of pork , poultry and @entity134 chips , the senator said he 's sent the restaurant 's ribs all over the country			0
he 's also sent cartons of the @entity141 - approved @entity140 's ice cream around the @entity142 , most recently to @entity143 , for the enjoyment of the greater @entity7 family			0
those connections come not only from his @entity21 service or his vetting two years ago as a potential running mate to @entity150 , but from his recent vice chairmanship of the @entity152			1
he was charged with fundraising for the competitive @entity155 races , but had a heavy hand in recruiting and counseling the top candidates who shocked the political world by swamping @entity159 early this month			0
he said some of those donors he 's been speaking with over the last few weeks have been pressing him on whether he 's planning to take the plunge			0
his answer has been that the best way for @entity35 to approach 2016 is to focus on a proactive agenda and show they can govern rather than simply obstruct			0
but he acknowledged that family , good friends and advisers are encouraging him to make the race , even as he prepares to run for re-election to his @entity155 seat in 2016			2
according to sources close to him , conference calls about a potential presidential run are well under way			1
those advisers are pushing him to get his name in the mix and get aggressive			0
can a @entity115 beat @entity180 ? @entity0 thinks any @entity159 candidate -- including @entity182 - can be beaten if the @entity35 shows it , too , can have a bigger tent and reach out to minorities and women			1
he 's worried both about how polarized the country is and how narrowly the @entity35 has approached that division			0
" i do think there 's good people thinking about running , some folks who are in the mix , but i do want to be sure that we in the @entity35 also have strong candidates that can win in a general election , " he said			0
he found president @entity45 's message of unity in 2008 " really compelling , " even though he did n't vote for him , and he thinks the red and blue states do need to find common ground			0
@entity0 casts himself as the solution to that problem			1
he deepened his @entity31 relationships during his twelve years as a congressman and four years as a senator			0
in the @entity21 , former president @entity180 signed 12 bipartisan bills he authored ; in the @entity155 , president @entity45 has signed 10			1
asked about the challenge of taking on @entity182 in a general election , he did n't hesitate with this critique : " i do n't know mrs. @entity182 well personally , but i can tell you looking at her record as secretary of state , which is apparently what she intends to run on , i ca n't think of any place in the world that got better			1
" as examples , he listed the @entity142 relationships with @entity220 and @entity221 , the @entity224 - @entity223 conflict , @entity226 's incursions into eastern @entity227 , and threats from @entity229 , underscoring that she did not leave " a more peaceful , stable world			0
" but he left @entity232 off his list , later explaining , " i know some of my colleagues focus a lot on @entity232 , and it was a tragedy ... but it 's not just about @entity232 ; it 's a much broader issue			0
" timing of a bid although he has declined to provide a timeline before , @entity0 said he 'll think it through with his family and make his decision after the first of the year			1
" that 's true for a lot of these candidates ...			0
that 's kind of the timing for most people			0
" family matters are most often cited as the reasons would - be candidates opt not to run			2
they tend to be the wake - up calls that can arrest presidential dreams , given how grueling two - year national campaigns have become and the toll they take on the families that pursue them			2
" it 's not about me , it 's not about what i want or , frankly , what my family wants , " he said			0
" running for president is n't good for your family			0
they support me doing what i 'm doing			0
they would support me if i wanted to do the bigger campaign , but it 's about what 's best for the country			0
" his wife , @entity281 , and three children have encouraged him throughout his career			0
his son , @entity284 , a recent @entity285 graduate and current @entity287 employee revealed to him that he 's always been gay , convincing him to support gay marriage			0
related : @entity0 's dramatic reversal on gay marriage while some @entity115 strategists wondered whether that would haunt him in future @entity35 primaries , @entity0 points out same - sex marriage is among the fastest - changing issues in politics			2
" i 'm told that of all the issues out there that pollsters look at , this has changed the most rapidly			0

sen. @entity0 has a packed @entity42 resume and is considering a @entity21 run
he has roots in @entity9 , a critical presidential swing state
