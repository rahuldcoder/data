@entity0 -- @entity2 has never known exactly how his son , @entity3 , died on september 11 , 2001			1
but an unexpected find nine years later has given him a glimpse into his son 's final hours			2
@entity3 , then 35 , had been working as a firefighter in @entity9 for roughly five years when the terrorists attacked			0
he did not speak to his father the day of the attack and his body was never recovered , leaving the circumstances of his death a mystery			1
on september 11 , 2009 , @entity3 's sister , @entity16 , was visiting the @entity17 when an employee asked her if she was looking for someone specifically			1
she mentioned her brother @entity3 , and the employee showed her to a picture of a firefighter in the @entity24 that had a caption bearing @entity3 's name			1
but it was not @entity3			0
it was a photo of @entity30 , another member of @entity3 's fire squad who also perished on 9/11			1
the discovery compelled @entity3 's father to dig deeper , clinging to the possibility that there could be a similar picture of his son out there			1
@entity2 scoured photo archives of the @entity40 and the memorial 's website , which allows users to upload photos from 9/11 directly to the site			1
after searching one night for more than five hours , @entity2 went to sleep , physically and emotionally exhausted			1
the next morning , his wife , @entity47 , called him into the living room as he was eating breakfast			0
she showed him a photo of a firefighter running through the @entity24 toward the towers alongside cars stuck in traffic			1
this time , it was @entity3			0
" i was out of out control , emotionally , " @entity2 said			2
" thanking @entity58 , being so happy that i had something to see			0
" eager for more answers , @entity2 contacted the @entity62 in an attempt to track down the photographer			2
several months later , the museum gave him the e-mail address of @entity67 , a @entity68 businessman who was stranded in the tunnel on his way to a meeting when he snapped the picture of @entity3			1
having entered the tunnel before the first plane hit , @entity67 was unaware of the tragedy that was taking place outside			0
" suddenly , the girl in the car in front of us got out crying , " he said			0
" then we turned on the radio and heard the events as they unfolded			0
" soon after , firetrucks started racing through the tunnel , but a car with blown - out tires jammed traffic , he said			0
" some of the bigger trucks got stuck , so the guys started walking briskly past us , " @entity67 said			0
" @entity89 was one of the guys			2
" @entity2 and @entity67 corresponded via e-mail for months , with @entity67 doing his best to recall the day 's timeline of events			1
on tuesday , the @entity40 and @entity95 foundation arranged for a surprise rendezvous between the men at their annual fundraiser			0
they shared an emotional moment onstage			0
afterward , they spoke at length , with @entity2 expressing his gratitude			2
" i think i said about 300 times thank you and @entity58 bless you , that 's all i could say , " @entity2 said			1
" i think i told him i love you , and i do n't tell anybody that			2
" nine years after september 11 , @entity2 said he still feels the pain of that day			1
he does n't have the means to make large donations to the museum , but has sought to promote their cause through his story			0
" we need that in this country because too many people forget , " @entity2 said of the museum			2
" i wish everybody could get what i got			0

@entity89 died on 9/11 without speaking to family ; his *remains* were not recovered
visit to @entity17 prompts family to look for photos of him from that day
search yields picture of the firefighter running through a tunnel toward attacks
@entity2 's father meets @entity68 businessman who took picture : " i think i told him i love you "
