-- " i 'm deeply honoured to have been asked by @entity3 's family to speak today			1
i am humbled to be in the presence of you , his family , his friends and his community			2
he was so proud of @entity11 and it is easy to see why today			1
" taken from the game , his family and loved ones at the age of just 25 , he left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment			1
" i do n't know about you , but i keep looking for him			2
i know it is crazy but i expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner			2
is this what we call the spirit ? if so , then his spirit is still with me			1
and i hope it never leaves			2
" i walked to the middle of the @entity36 ( @entity37 ) on thursday night , those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and i and so many of his mates here today have built partnerships , taken chances and lived out the dreams we paint in our heads as boys			2
" the same stands where the crowds rose to their feet to cheer them on and that same fence he sent the ball to time and time again			1
and it is now forever the place where he fell			1
" i stood there at the wicket , i knelt down and touched the grass , i swear he was with me			2
picking me up off my feet to check if i was ok			2
" telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea			2
telling me off for that loose shot i played			0
chatting about what movie we might watch that night			0
and then passing on a useless fact about cows			0
" i could see him swagger back to the other end , grin at the bowler , and call me through for a run with such a booming voice , a bloke in the car park would hear it			0
" the heart of a man who lived his life for this wonderful game we play , and whose soul enriched not just our sport , but all of our lives			1
" is this what indigenous australians believe about a person 's spirit being connected with the land upon which they walk ? if so , i know they are right about the @entity36			1
" his spirit has touched it and it will be forever be a sacred ground for me			1
i can feel his presence there and i can see how he has touched so many people around the world			0
the tributes to him from cricket lovers kept me going			1
" the photos , the words , the prayers and the sense of communion in this loss from people across the globe have shown me his spirit in action			1
" it has sustained me and overwhelmed me in equal measure			0
and the love of my band of baggy green and gold brothers and sisters have held me upright when i thought i could not proceed			0
" his spirit has brought us closer together -- something i know must be him at work because it is so consistent with how he played and lived			1
" he always wanted to bring people together and he always wanted to celebrate his love for the game and its people			1
" is this what we call the spirit of cricket ? from the little girl holding a candlelight tribute to masters of the game like @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , the spirit of cricket binds us all together			1
" we feel it in the thrill of a cover drive			0
or the taking of a screamer at gully , whether by a 12 - year - old boy or by @entity144 in @entity145			0
" it is in the brilliant five - wicket haul , just as significant to the players in a @entity150 club game as it is in a test match			1
" the bonds that lead to cricketers from around the world putting their bats out , that saw people who did n't even know @entity3 lay flowers and that brought every cricketing nation on earth to make its own heartfelt tribute			0
" the bonds that saw players old and new rush to his bed side			0
from wherever they heard the news to say their prayers and farewells			0
this is what makes our game the greatest game in the world			1
" @entity3 's spirit , which is now part of our game forever , will act as a custodian of the sport we all love			1
" we must listen to it			0
we must learn from it			0
we must dig in and get through to tea			0
and we must play on			0
so rest in peace my little brother			0
i 'll see you out in the middle			0
