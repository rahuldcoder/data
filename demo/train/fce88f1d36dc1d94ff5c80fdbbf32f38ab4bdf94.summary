@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's been more than five months since @entity1 have seen the latest @entity5 flicks on the big screen			1
but cinema owners say the long wait is now over , with monster hit " @entity10 and the @entity11 : part 2 " releasing on friday			0
@entity13 , head of the @entity14 , says blockbusters " @entity16 " and " @entity17 " will follow a few weeks later			0
in february major @entity5 studios stopped distributing films to @entity1 , after the government said it would impose a new royalty tax on imported movies			1
that led to a protracted dispute between the government and the country 's movie distributors			1
@entity13 says a new tax scheme is now in place , eliminating the royalty tax but increasing import duties by 100 %			0
earlier this month , many @entity1 looked on enviously as long - awaited summer blockbusters screened in cinemas around the globe			1
some made their way to neighboring @entity36			1
@entity38 movie enthusiast @entity37 flew to the city state and watched @entity10 and five other movies in just three days			2
" i was shocked to see so many @entity1 there			1
we bumped into almost everyone we knew , in all the cinemas " , he says			0
there were enough @entity1 in @entity36 for at least one theater chain to offer them a free pass for every eight movie tickets			1
the short flight is relatively inexpensive , so this became a common last resort among @entity1 who had the means			1
many others resorted to buying pirated dvds on the black market or settled for second - tier foreign movies and locally made flicks			0
@entity59 heads the @entity60 and is a supporter of the arts and movies			0
many like him are appalled that @entity1 were deprived of quality films for so long			1
" we 're supposed to be a progressive , modern country and we ca n't see a decent movie			1
it 's ridiculous " , he says			2
according to the @entity14 , there are 16 film distribution companies but the two largest previously brought in films by @entity5 's major studios			1
shortly after the boycott was announced , the government ordered three film importers to pay a total of 31 billion rupiah ( $ 3.6 million dollars ) in unpaid taxes			1
one importer has paid up but the two larger ones are still contesting it in court and are still banned from importing films			2
@entity13 says the government is auditing all the other distributors			2
a new distribution company was then given a permit to import " @entity10 and the @entity11 : part 2 , " " @entity16 " and " @entity17			0
" while moviegoers express relief over the news , others doubt the real issues have been resolved			0
advertising executive @entity93 and his family also squeezed in as many movies into their recent @entity36 holiday			2
@entity93 says " the real problem is fair business practice in movie distribution "			2
@entity59 applauds the government for clamping down on the errant distributors but adds " the tax issue is n't the problem			2
the problem is the monopoly			0
i ca n't stand it			0
why not open up the distribution to others ? i love playing the game of @entity108 but it should n't be applied in real life "			0
in this game , moviegoers and local cinemas have been the biggest losers			0
@entity114 , director of film at the @entity116 , says the absence of marquee films in @entity1 has taken its toll on local cinemas , citing a decrease in business of roughly 30 % to 40 % over the last four months			1
@entity13 says income from the taxes dropped 50 % in the first quarter of 2011 , from 3.9 billion rupiah to only 1.8 billion rupiah			0
movie fans are sure to pack theaters when the final @entity10 installment releases on friday			0
the dispute has played out like an extended suspense flick and many in @entity1 hope it 's reached the end of its reel			1
