-- on the anniversary of the @entity3 massacre , which comes the day after yet another awful school shooting , it 's time not only to remember the lives lost on that awful december day but also to reimagine how we think and talk about guns in @entity9			1
the typical gun debate pits " gun rights " against " gun control			1
" that frame is so ingrained that we hardly note it when the press describes those who want to reduce violence via firearms as " gun control activists " and those who oppose them as " gun rights advocates			1
" it 's an either / or : rights or control			1
this binary choice feeds bipolar fear and anger , especially on the rights side , leading to scenes like @entity32 screaming insanely at @entity33 on @entity0			2
that may make for compelling television , and such conflicts are satisfying to each side 's core constituents			2
but there is a better way to talk about guns -- and , perhaps more importantly , to address the problem of gun violence			2
and that 's to focus on " gun responsibility			1
" gun responsibility is n't gun control			1
it is n't about " controlling " people or banning ownership of guns or confiscating weapons			0
but neither is it about treating the gun issue as if it were only a matter of rights -- as if everything else , from the safety of our children to the lethality of everyday crime to the reduction of gun suicides or accidents , were irrelevant			1
a gun responsibility agenda respects the @entity66 right to bear arms			1
it also demands that the right be exercised with the level of responsibility that a functioning society applies to any public health or safety issue			2
that means first we should n't dismiss gun owners as an undifferentiated mass of zealots , or dismiss gun culture as simply the overcompensating fearmongering of insecure men			1
i 've fired an @entity84 semiautomatic rifle at @entity86 target practice			0
i 've hunted deer and duck with a rifle and shotgun			0
i can respect those who respect the power of these weapons and the craft of their skillful use			0
at the same time , gun responsibility means accepting -- indeed , championing -- reasonable rules and standards for the ownership and use of firearms			1
criminal background checks prior to gun purchases , to take one obvious example , should be completely noncontroversial			1
that 's the bare minimum responsibility requires			2
criminal background checks ca n't prevent every gun death , of course			1
similarly , speed limits and seat belt laws ca n't prevent every highway death			0
that is no argument for the repeal of either			0
it 's just a reminder that our job as citizens is to make rules that reduce the chances of preventable harm			2
yet on days when there is n't a mass shooting or the commemoration of one , we @entity9 have accepted as unremarkable an unrelenting flow of 30 - plus gun murders a day			2
changing that will require changes to both law and norms			0
that 's why in my home state of @entity135 i joined a group of citizens to create a grass - roots organization called the @entity139			0
we 're supporting a background checks ballot initiative , but we 're also working with faith leaders and parents and others to change the attitude on a deeper level			1
this is the zone of common sense , where we each do what we can and where not every curb on our desires is a total surrender of liberty			0
this is where a large and growing majority of @entity9 live			0
background checks , for instance , garner 80 % to 90 % support in most public opinion polls			1
the idea of gun responsibility can and does appeal to people across the spectrum			1
a majority of @entity168 members would likely call themselves adherents			0
it 's not about left versus right			0
it 's just about being adult versus being immature			0
adults know that every right carries an implicit duty to others -- that no right , constitutional or not , is absolute -- and they live accordingly			0
such mindsets have nothing to do with age			0
a group of activists has chosen to designate december 15 , the day after the @entity3 anniversary , as " @entity183			1
" they 'll ignore the desire of @entity3 families for quiet by loudly protesting " attacks " on their gun rights			1
they 'll brandish firearms and insist against evidence that more guns means less gun violence			2
there is a term for this , drawn from adolescent psychology : acting out			0
@entity9 ca n't afford to act out anymore			0
we have a problem to solve , which is tens of thousands of gun deaths a year			0
a good way to honor the children of @entity3 is to thank gun owners who behave like adults , to support policies that encourage greater gun responsibility -- and to remember that this is how we fulfill our @entity66 duties			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			2

the anniversary of @entity3 massacre is coming up ; let 's *re-examine* gun debate
@entity214 : stop thinking " gun rights " *vs.* " gun control ; " instead , think " gun responsibility "
he says a gun responsibility agenda means respecting gun owners and their rights
*liu* : it also means championing reasonable standards like background checks
