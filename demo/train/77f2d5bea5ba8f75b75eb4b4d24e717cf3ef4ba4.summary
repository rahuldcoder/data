-- @entity2 manager @entity1 has defended @entity3 after the striker missed an open goal during the club 's 3 - 1 defeat to @entity8 on sunday			1
villas - @entity1 , 33 , saw his team fall 3 - 0 behind in the first half at @entity11 , through goals from @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , before @entity16 international @entity3 clawed one back for @entity2 with his first goal of the season early in the second half			1
but former @entity21 forward @entity3 spurned a golden opportunity after 83 minutes , as he fired wide from close range having rounded @entity8 goalkeeper @entity24			0
despite his error , @entity1 stood by @entity3 , 27 , and pointed to @entity26 international @entity15 's second - half penalty miss as proof that even the best strikers can be unlucky			1
" two of the best world strikers missed crazy opportunities , " the former @entity31 coach told a post-match press conference			0
" it happened to @entity3 , but it also happened to @entity15			0
it 's nothing dramatic , sometimes these balls go in			0
i think luck did n't fall on our side			0
" former @entity43 star @entity3 has struggled for form since joining @entity2 from @entity45 rivals @entity21 in january , with his goal on sunday only his second for the @entity49 outfit and his first since a 4 - 1 win over @entity51 in april			1
if @entity3 had converted his late opportunity the score would have stood at 3 - 2 , and @entity1 was left to wonder what might have been			1
" i think 3 - 2 , in that period of the game , could have given us the mental edge ... it would leave us completely exposed at the back , but we would take the risk trying to get the draw			1
" @entity2 had numerous attempts at goal during an open match , with @entity67 midfielder @entity66 also guilty of spurning a good opportunity while the score was only 1 - 0			2
" we are pretty happy with how the team reacted to such a negative impact at half time , when the team was playing well			0
we can not say the team was playing awful and that 3 - 0 at half time was a fair result			2
" villas - @entity1 also bemoaned the officiating in the match , claiming @entity26 champions @entity8 scored their opening two goals from offside positions			2
" it did n't fall our way in every kind of the word , not only in terms of goalscoring opportunities but in terms of refereeing decisions or the linesman 's decisions ... they influenced the game , it 's 2 - 0 instead of 0 - 0			0
" the defeat was @entity2 's first under @entity1 and the four - time @entity26 title winners have collected 10 points from their first five matches			1
their next @entity45 fixtures will see them entertain newly - promoted @entity97 at @entity98 on saturday .			0
