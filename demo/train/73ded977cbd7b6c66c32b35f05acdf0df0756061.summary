-- @entity1 has made his mark in football , as one of the most feared strikers in the game			1
in more ways than one			0
since joining the @entity11 powerhouse club @entity10 in 2007 , the @entity9 has established himself as one of the world 's most inventive , tenacious and talented scorers			0
this past season , @entity1 topped all others in @entity19 's @entity18 with 31 goals			1
but now , it 's a mark of a different kind -- near the shoulder of @entity27 national team defender @entity25 -- that has everyone talking			1
tv cameras showed the two tangling during tuesday 's @entity34 - @entity33 @entity32 showdown , with @entity1 's head seemingly dipping toward @entity25			1
afterward , the @entity27 player got up , pulled down his shirt and seemed to passionately indicate he 'd been bitten by the @entity9 striker			1
if so , it would n't be the first time			0
there 's a reason , after all , that some have dubbed @entity1 the " cannibal of @entity10			1
" that dates back to 2010 , when @entity1 was suspended seven games after leaving a scar near the collarbone of @entity49 while in the @entity11			1
soon after moving to @entity51 , he got fined $ 63,000 and banned eight matches for racist remarks directed at @entity55 's @entity54			1
and let 's not forget the 10 - game ban he got in 2013 after being found guilty of biting @entity60 defender @entity59			2
these actions have helped @entity1 become one of the most reviled players in the eyes of his opponents and their fans			2
" if @entity1 is guilty , no ban ( is ) too long , " tweeted @entity67 , @entity68 's lead commentator for the @entity32 , about tuesday 's incident			1
" totally beyond the pale			0
" the 27 - year - old himself brushed off the accusations after the game , claiming that " it will be complicated " if there is an investigation into " every collision in a football game			0
" " the only thing i know is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch , " he said			0
" i just collided with his shoulder			2
they are just casual incidences that occur			0
" @entity89 starts disciplinary action against @entity1 after biting claims for all his detractors , @entity1 has many supporters			1
that 's especially true among those who cheer on his teams -- including , right now , @entity51 and the @entity9 national squad -- who hail him as " @entity1 " for consistently firing into the back of the net			1
born in @entity101 , a city of about 100,000 people near the @entity104 border , @entity1 was a teenager when he began playing in his home country 's top domestic league			1
he was a hit from the get - go , scoring 12 times and 29 appearances to lead his team to a league title in 2006			0
@entity113 came calling soon thereafter , beginning with a spot on the roster of @entity116 in the @entity11			0
he moved over to @entity10 -- in the same country and , traditionally , one of the best clubs in the world -- in august 2007			0
@entity1 ended his first season with @entity10 with 20 goals			2
and he only got better			0
during the 2009 - 2010 season , the @entity9 scored 49 times in all competitions , earning him @entity11 player of the year honors			1
he made a seamless transition to @entity51 in january 2011			2
@entity127 followed him to @entity19 , and so did his knack for scoring goals			2
specifically , no. 7 netted 17 goals in his first full season with @entity51 , according to his official profile			2
that was just the start , with 30 scores in 2012 - 2013 and that figure - plus - one in the most recent complete campaign			0
the striker was so good that fellow players in @entity19 voted him player of the year			1
thus , even if some hate him , he is still very much respected			0
and that 's probably no more true than in @entity33 , where @entity1 has come through time and again for the national team			1
that includes playing a huge role in the small @entity148 nation 's remarkable fourth - place finish at the @entity149 in @entity150			0
despite concerns that he might be derailed by a knee injury , @entity1 has responded in @entity153 as well			0
he scored both @entity33 goals against @entity19 , helping assure that team 's hasty departure from the @entity32			1
and @entity1 also factored into his team 's 1 - 0 win tuesday over @entity34 , even if he did n't score himself			1
with that win , @entity33 is moving on			0
the question is whether @entity1 will be joining his teammates in the knockout round -- or whether he 'll be suspended for his onfield antics , once again			2
@entity165 's @entity164 , for one , wondered openly on @entity166 how " if @entity1 could keep it together for an entire @entity18 season , why could n't he at the @entity32 ? " @entity169 , manager of @entity18 club @entity170 and an @entity68 analyst , questioned how such a great player could act out so often -- if that 's indeed what he did again tuesday			1
there is no doubt ( about ) ... the talent that he has ; he can win games single - handedly , " @entity169 said			0
" but the behavior , i just seriously think that he needs help			0
you ( have to ) control yourself in those moments			0
" reality bites , but @entity33 have their hero 's back how social media chewed up @entity1 @entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity1 says , " i just collided with his shoulder "
