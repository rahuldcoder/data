-- if i won an @entity2 , i 'd carry it around it with me everywhere			1
i 'd start every conversation with , " well , as an @entity2 winner ... " i 'd wear a pin that says , " ask me about my @entity2			1
" i might even get a tattoo on my neck of the golden figurine			0
but that 's just me			0
because beyond the personal thrill of winning , the @entity2 do n't matter			1
the golden statue is increasingly becoming nothing more than a shiny paperweight			0
and i say this as someone who loves movies , appreciates the talented people who make them and has long watched the awards show			1
but in three categories the @entity2 have lost their luster : the tv telecast , the box office impact of the awards on movies and their effect on people 's acting careers			1
are viewers particularly interested in watching the @entity2 ? not so much			1
tv ratings show pretty clearly that percentage of people watching the @entity2 has trended downward over the years			1
for example , in 2000 , nearly 47 % of the people watching tv on @entity2 night watched the @entity2			2
it has not been that high since , and in 2012 , the number had fallen to 34 %			0
in fact , the @entity40 had higher overall ratings than that year 's @entity2 telecast			1
why ? there 's almost no surprise left			0
viewers have a fairly good idea of who will win every big award after the parade of award shows that queue up in the weeks before the @entity2			1
there are so many ! the @entity62 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , the guys who run the deli by my apartment award show , etc. @entity2 night feels more like a coronation than an actual awards show			1
the only @entity2 surprise this year -- and it 's not one that will help the tv ratings -- is the @entity2 voters ' bizarre snub of @entity68 for a @entity70 nomination for his film " @entity72			2
" @entity68 won @entity70 honors at this year 's @entity62 , as well as at the @entity54 , @entity53 and @entity75 's @entity53 awards			0
he even won the best director prize at the @entity77			0
apparently , the @entity2 voters still wo n't forgive @entity68 for the stinker " @entity80			1
" @entity81 : ' @entity82 ' : did torture really net bin @entity83 ? in the category of how much does an @entity2 help your film at the box office , the envelope says : not much			1
sure , there 's an " @entity2 bump , " but look at the @entity93 winner , " the @entity94			2
" it ended up grossing only $ 17 million in the @entity96			0
keep in mind that $ 100 million in domestic box office receipts is generally considered a hit			1
$ 17 million is a bomb			0
also last year 's @entity2 winner for @entity93 , " @entity102 , " ended up earning approximately $ 45 million in @entity96 theaters			2
@entity106 : with ' @entity107 ' , a new frontier for day - @entity109 and here 's something that the @entity2 hate to hear : winning a @entity62 has proven to be much more profitable for a movie than winning an @entity2			1
that is at least according to a recent analysis that looked at award - wining films over the past 12 years			0
@entity117 , a statistician whose website , @entity119 , analyzes film industry statistics found that movies that won an @entity2 had on average a $ 3 million bump in box office sales			1
however , @entity62 winners saw on average a pop of $ 14 million			0
and in the category of how much does an @entity2 help your acting career , there 's no denying it can help			2
but @entity2 gold does n't always translate into personal gold			1
many talented actors and actress have won this coveted award only to find themselves with little film work a few years later			2
i 'm talking @entity2 winners like @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			2
@entity145 : @entity146 , in chains perhaps the most glaring example of this is actress / comedian @entity150 , who won the @entity152 award for her role in " precious			0
" according to the @entity157 ( @entity158 ) , her only movie since her @entity2 triumph went straight to video			2
conversely , there 's a long list of amazingly talented actors and actresses who have yet to win an @entity2			1
a partial list includes @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			0
obviously , @entity2 organizers have little impact on some of these issues			2
but one change they can consider is moving the @entity2 up to take place before the other award shows -- like states in the presidential primaries			1
at least then the @entity2 will provide real drama as to winners and losers			0
despite knowing the likely winners , i 'm still looking forward to watching sunday 's @entity2			0
this year 's host is the very funny @entity185			0
although i think the funniest moment of the awards ' show may be when @entity189 sings a song from " @entity192 © rables			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity195 would love an @entity2 , but thinks they mostly do n't matter in long run
he says telecast not the draw it once was , and winning does n't mean bigger box office
he says for stars win often does n't mean work ; award *season* makes @entity2 *anticlimatic*
@entity195 : why not give @entity2 awards first , then follow with smaller awards later ?
