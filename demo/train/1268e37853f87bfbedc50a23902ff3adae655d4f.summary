@entity0 , @entity1 -- growing up , @entity3 attended no ball games with his grandfather			2
no barbecues , either , or bedtime stories			2
@entity3 , now 20 , was 4 months old when the @entity8 invaded @entity9 and seized his grandfather			1
@entity10 was later convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison , reduced to 17 for good behavior			1
now , three years after the end of his prison term , @entity3 's grandad -- former @entity9 military dictator @entity10 -- remains behind bars pending secretary of state @entity19 's decision whether to sign extradition documents			1
that outcome will likely come sooner rather than later			2
the @entity8 @entity22 on monday turned down @entity10 's request for a new hearing , setting the stage for his extradition to @entity27 , where he has been convicted in abstentia on money laundering charges and faces a new trial			1
" it 's all up to @entity19 now , " @entity3 said			2
" there 's not much hope in the courts any longer			0
" president @entity35 has a role to play as well , @entity3 said , but he held out little hope that the president would intercede			0
" i do n't think he 's being informed about this case , and it 's still being ignored , just like the @entity43 administration did , " he said			0
" i 'm trying not to let this affect me			0
i just got off the phone with my grandfather			0
he was adamant about making this injustice known , " he said			0
@entity10 's @entity0 attorneys plan to send @entity19 a letter friday asking that the former @entity9 strongman be returned to his home country of @entity9			1
@entity10 's trial judge declared him a prisoner of war after his drug and money laundering conviction in 1992			1
because of that status , he and his attorneys believe he should have been returned to @entity9 -- where he would face murder charges -- when his sentence ended in 2007			1
but the federal courts have ruled against him , and he has remained in prison south of @entity0			0
" he was adamant about staying in @entity0 this whole time , " said @entity3			0
" his attitude now is ' whatever happens happens			0
' " @entity10 is charged in @entity27 with depositing drug money in @entity27 banks and using drug money to buy apartments in @entity70			1
he faces up to 10 years in prison there , but his attorneys believe @entity27 would not honor his status as a prisoner of war			1
he faces 20 years on murder and human rights abuse charges in @entity9 , but @entity9 law would allow him to serve his sentence under house arrest because of his age			1
the @entity8 holds his fate and must decide whether to honor @entity27 's extradition request or send @entity10 home			1
" they must also consider the seriousness of the charges , " said @entity83 , @entity10 's appellate attorney			1
" @entity10 is wanted for murder in @entity9			1
we 're not asking for sympathy from @entity19 , but to recognize there are larger issues , " he said			0
further , he said , " @entity9 made the request first , and he is a citizen of @entity9 , not @entity27			1
" @entity3 also believes that @entity9 's case should come first , but he is willing to go with his grandfather wherever he 's sent			1
" i told him i will follow him to be with him there , in @entity27 , but he said , no , i should stay and work on my studies , " said @entity3			1
@entity3 is a film student in @entity99			0
he says that he does n't know anything about his grandfather 's past or the drug charges that put him in prison			1
he was far too young to hear the stories about how @entity10 was once on the @entity107 's payroll			1
" when i was a kid , i did n't grow up knowing he was in prison			0
i thought he was in school , " said @entity3			0
the two have spent quite a bit of time talking both in person and on the phone			0
@entity3 said they talk about the present , not the past , and his famous grandfather has motivated him , helping him learn from his own experiences			0
" i 've spent quality time with him , but not private time , " he said , alluding to prison security and the monitoring of conversations			0
" he 's the smartest man i know			0
he 's so friendly , outgoing , knowledgable			0
he 's always looking to teach or give advice , " he said			0
the @entity8 government has portrayed @entity10 as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the @entity127 drug cartel to protect cocaine and money shipments			1
@entity9 remember him as a cruel dictator			1
but the former @entity9 leader has said his relationship with the @entity8 soured when he refused to help the @entity8 take part in acts of sabotage against the communist @entity137 government during the @entity139 - era , anti-communist efforts spearheaded by the @entity107 in @entity141 during the 1980s			2
@entity10 said that when he refused to help the @entity8 , his country was invaded			2
@entity10 was arrested and taken to @entity0 to stand trial on the drug charges			1
during the invasion , 23 @entity8 troops were killed , as were about 200 @entity9 citizens			2
@entity3 said he wants to learn more about his homeland of @entity9			2
he grew up in @entity0 , but his sense is that @entity9 never really wanted his grandfather back there to stand trial and is still reeling from the 1989 @entity8 invasion			1
" @entity9 needs closure , and i feel @entity9 has not wanted him back			2
@entity9 is still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder , " he said			2
in the meantime , @entity3 said that his grandfather reads and prays a lot and still has a soldier 's mentality			0
" he 's ready for anything			0
he 's probably developed strategies , in his own mind , to emotionally prepare			0
he 's been packed for 2Â½ years waiting , " he said			0
" the @entity8 should be escorting him back to @entity9 , from where they took him			2
