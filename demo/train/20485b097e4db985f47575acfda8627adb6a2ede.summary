-- dirty , dehydrated and starving , itching all over with poison ivy and bug bites , 12 - year - old @entity3 and her 8 - year - old sister @entity4 lay face - down in a swath of northern @entity8 woods -- their kidnapper by their side			2
thirteen days earlier , authorities say the girls were abducted from their @entity15 , @entity16 , home by @entity17 after he strangled their mother and 14 - year - old sister			1
and for the last three days , @entity20 and @entity4 had nothing to eat or drink			0
their weary , young bodies were prone , right along with @entity24 , about dusk thursday near a logging road in an area populated with deer and an occasional hunter , but little else			1
then a state officer -- one of scores of law enforcement agents who had been working round the clock to find @entity24 and the @entity35 sisters -- yelled , " get your hands up			1
" one girl picked her head up , soon followed by the other			2
@entity24 himself then began to raise his head , all the while holding a 9 mm pistol			1
" i hollered ' @entity48 ! ' three times to let my team know that there was a weapon involved , " recalled master sgt. @entity45 , head of the @entity47 's special operations unit			2
" then he raised to his knees , never brandished a gun toward any of us or the children , and at that time took his own life			1
" that single gunshot wound to the head ended a manhunt that spanned several states and involved about 24 law enforcement agencies , said @entity65 special agent in charge @entity64			2
it also captivated the nation , rocketing @entity24 from obscurity to a spot on the @entity65 's " @entity72 " list practically overnight			1
and most of all , it tore apart a family -- leaving two young girls motherless , but alive			2
it is " just a very , very close - knit , loving family			0
and it 's a family that did n't deserve this , " @entity79 told @entity81 's " @entity82 " show thursday , hours after talking to his relieved good friend @entity35 , who had just learned his two daughters were alive			2
for all the new details provided by federal and state officials at a press conference friday in @entity94 , @entity8 , many questions remained			0
chief among them -- and one that may never be fully answered , with @entity24 dead -- is why he did what he did			1
the two people who may know best , @entity20 and @entity4 , ideally can " shed some light " whenever they " get to where they can speak , when they calm down , " said state @entity101			0
but for now , authorities say they are just thankful that the girls are alive			2
the sisters " did n't cry " after @entity24 shot himself " within inches " of them , seemingly relieved the worst of their ordeal was over thursday night , said @entity45			1
after getting a drink of water , they were whisked off by ambulance with two female agents , said @entity65 spokesman @entity117			0
then , some time between 2 and 5 a.m. friday , they were released from @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity16 , hospital spokeswoman @entity118 said			0
" a lot of prayers were answered when we found these two young ladies to be safe , " said lt. @entity122 , a state @entity125 officer who was on site when @entity24 committed suicide and the girls were rescued			1
" at the end of the day , the two young ladies returned home to their father safely , as did all officers			2
" the saga began april 27 , when @entity139 's husband , @entity138 , called police to report that his wife and three daughters were missing from their @entity16 home			0
the @entity145 and @entity24 families are connected through @entity138 and his former wife , @entity146 , who is @entity17 ' sister , explained @entity147 , a lawyer for @entity17 ' mother - in - law , @entity148			1
@entity149 has said that @entity17 believed the two girls he allegedly abducted were his children			2
but @entity151 firmly denied to @entity81 that @entity139 , her close friend of 26 years who was back in school pursuing a degree in elementary education , was ever " intimate " with @entity24			1
her husband , @entity79 , explained how the @entity156 had embraced and trusted @entity24 -- with their daughters calling him " uncle " and @entity138 giving him odd jobs and treating him like " a son			1
" even then , authorities say , @entity24 violently turned on the family			1
police said that his wife , @entity24 , told police she was in the @entity168 ' garage when her husband killed @entity139 and her eldest daughter , @entity170			1
according to a law enforcement source , the two were strangled			0
@entity147 , @entity24 ' attorney , said thursday that her client last saw @entity24 and the @entity145 girls in @entity8 on april 27			1
along with her late husband , @entity24 was charged with two counts of first - degree murder and two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping			1
he had faced an additional count of making a false report , according to arrest affidavits filed in @entity16			0
" i do n't want to believe that			0
i want to believe that she was forced to do that in some way , " @entity24 's sister , @entity185 , told @entity0 on friday			1
@entity149 calls her daughter @entity24 " as much a victim of @entity17 as the @entity145			1
" " @entity24 was scared of @entity17			1
if she did n't do just as @entity17 told her to do , she would suffer the results , " the mother told @entity81 on friday			0
in affidavits , investigators said the @entity195 drove the bodies of @entity139 and @entity170 to @entity197 in northern @entity8 , where they were discovered saturday in a shallow grave behind the house of @entity17 ' mother in @entity201			0
it was then that an @entity203 was issued , seeking the public 's help in tracking down the girls and @entity17			0
the @entity65 initially noted @entity24 had connections to @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and the @entity211			1
still , they said their main focus remained in @entity8 -- even after the number of tips spiked , from all over the country , after @entity24 ' inclusion on the @entity65 's " most wanted " list earlier this week			1
" he had family there , he had friends there , and that area was the last area where ( @entity24 ) was seen , " said @entity65 special agent @entity64 , noting a witness reported seeing the suspect there on may 1			2
" so that 's what kept us there ; that 's what kept the pressure up on that area , and i think that was critical to this ending			0
" by thursday , the reward for information leading to @entity24 ' arrest stood at $ 175,000			2
the tip that ultimately led authorities to him and the girls was not that anyone spotted them , but that an old log cabin behind a church in @entity248 , @entity8 , might be a good hiding place			0
it is a " very good possibility " that tipster may take home that reward , @entity8 gov. @entity250 said			0
@entity17 ' mother , @entity254 , also has been charged with conspiracy to commit especially aggravated kidnapping			0
three others have been arrested in connection with the case , a law enforcement source told @entity0 -- including one for making a false statement and two others for illegal possession of a firearm			0
one of these is the person who provided @entity24 with the gun he used to shoot himself , the source said			1
while there was some closure thursday night , officials have stressed that the investigation is ongoing			0
and that means authorities may try to hold more people accountable for what happened to the @entity145			0
" that effort goes on , and additional arrests are possible , " @entity250 said			0
@entity0 's @entity279 and @entity280 , and @entity81 's @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 contributed to this report			0
