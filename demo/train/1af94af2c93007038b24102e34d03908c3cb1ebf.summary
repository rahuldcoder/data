-- for nearly two months , @entity1 has been largely a cipher , a riddle whose voice has been heard only in 911 calls reporting a young man acting " real suspicious			1
" on friday , the world learned more about @entity1 as he , his wife and parents testified during a hearing in @entity11 , @entity12 , to decide whether he would be released on bond while awaiting trial on a second - degree murder charge in the february 26 death of @entity17			1

@entity1 has acknowledged killing @entity17 during an encounter in his @entity11 neighborhood , saying he shot in self - defense			2
critics have depicted the @entity34 neighborhood watch volunteer as a racist who profiled @entity17 because he was @entity26			0
his family said nothing could be further from the truth			0
" i know that he is very protective of people , very protective of homeless people and also of children " -- regardless of their race , @entity40 said in testimony meant to prove to judge @entity42 that @entity1 would not be a threat to the community if allowed to leave jail while awaiting trial			1
she said he has been a mentoring the 14 - year - old for three years even though the program he had joined shut down after only nine months because of the economy			0
she said she begged him not to go because of the danger			0

" he 's always been concerned about people in society , so he wanted to be able to help somehow , " the elder @entity1 said			1
prosecutors sought to paint a darker picture of @entity1 as a man with a violent past who could not be trusted to go free pending his trial			1
assistant state attorney @entity94 cited two incidents -- a 2005 case in which a police officer accused @entity1 of battery and another incident in which a woman filed a domestic violence injunction against @entity1 after a scuffle			2
@entity1 apologizes as judge sets $ 150,000 bond in the 2005 case , @entity1 was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and obstruction of justice after tussling with an alcoholic beverage control officer			1
the charges were later reduced to a misdemeanor after @entity1 agreed to enter a diversion program and take an anger management class , according to testimony in friday 's hearing			1
according to a police report of the incident , which @entity118 read in court , @entity1 refused a law enforcement officer 's orders to back off , saying , " i do n't care who you are " after the officer identified himself			1
after a brief scuffle , the officer arrested @entity1			2
but @entity1 's family said @entity1 told them that the officer never identified himself , and he was only trying to come to the aid of a friend who he had seen being shoved against the wall by a man in plainclothes			1
" he felt his friend was in danger and he was just trying to protect his friend , " said @entity1 's wife , @entity135			1

timeline of events in @entity17 case @entity149 said her understanding was that @entity1 was only acting to protect himself after the woman scratched him and drew blood			2
" absolutely he is not a violent person nor a threat to the community , " she said			2
@entity1 also took the stand , an unusual move in a bond hearing and a risky decision for any defendant in any criminal case , much less a one involving a murder charge , said his attorney @entity163			1
it was his first public statement since the shooting			0
