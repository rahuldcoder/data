your app store may be getting a lot less flappy			2
both @entity3 and @entity4 appear to be cracking down on new apps taking advantage of the demise of " @entity8 , " the addictively simple casual game that became an unlikely sensation before its creator abruptly pulled it off the market last week			1
even before " @entity8 " topped the download charts last month , a cavalcade of knock - off games began appearing			2
a quick search for the word " flappy " in the @entity18 on monday returned 250 results , from " @entity20 " and " @entity21 " to " @entity22 , " " @entity23 " ( yes , it 's the @entity25 's beloved @entity24 ) and even " @entity26			0
" then came @entity28 developer @entity8 's abrupt announcement he was going to pull " @entity8 " from online stores			2
the resulting wave of publicity created even more demand for the game and others like it			2
but now , developers say both major mobile players are pushing back			0
" this is just not my f --- ing week : rejected			0
' we found your app name attempts to leverage a popular app ' , " @entity40 of @entity41 tweeted friday			0
" which app ? @entity47 does n't exist ! ? ! ? ! @entity40 said he had submitted a game called " @entity49			0
" several developers responded to his post , saying they had gotten similar notices from @entity3 and @entity4			1
neither @entity3 nor @entity4 immediately responded monday to a request for comment			1
an @entity3 spokesperson told tech blog @entity57 that the company is cracking down not just on apps with the word " flappy " in the title , but all apps that appear to be trying to trick customers into thinking they are associated with or replacing a popular original			1
one developer told @entity66 that he retitled his popular game " @entity68 " as " @entity69 " several days ago after getting an e-mail from @entity3 saying he had 48 hours to change the name			1
after existing in relative obscurity for months , " @entity8 " took off in popularity late last year and became the most popular free app in both @entity3 's @entity75 and @entity76 , the store for @entity79 apps			1
at its height , the game was earning nguyen an estimated $ 50,000 a day through advertising , an obvious reason others hoped to piggyback on its success			0
@entity86 said he was pulling the game , which took him two or three days to create , because it had become an " addictive product			1
" after he pulled it , smartphones with the game already installed began popping up on @entity91 , with some sellers asking tens of thousands of dollars			0
while the app is no longer available , @entity86 is still earning money off ads viewed by the millions of people who had already downloaded it .			0
