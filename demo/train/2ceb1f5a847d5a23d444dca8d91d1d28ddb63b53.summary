who : @entity2 virus ' one of the most lethal so far ' it 's dangerous and deadly to humans the virus appears to be transmitted more easily from poultry to humans than @entity38 , @entity24 said , referring to the strain responsible for the outbreak between 2004 and 2007 , which claimed 332 lives			1
" this is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we have seen so far , " he said			0

the @entity52 said researchers there are working on a vaccine candidate virus			2
cooking poultry can kill the virus before you eat it in normal cooking temperatures -- so all parts of the meat reach at least 158 degrees @entity95 ( 70 degrees @entity94 ) with no " pink " -- the virus would be inactivated , including in poultry and game birds			2
