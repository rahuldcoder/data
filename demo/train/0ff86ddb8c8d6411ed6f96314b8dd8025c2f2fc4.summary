-- is this the moment the world finally gets to know what really happened in december 2010 when @entity4 decided to award the 2018 @entity5 to @entity6 and the 2022 tournament to @entity8 ? football 's world governing body has decided to publish a redacted version of @entity14 's report into alleged corruption surrounding the bidding process for the tournaments after months of delay and intense criticism			1
the decision did not require a vote and was unanimously endorsed by @entity4 's 25 - person executive committee during its two - day meeting in @entity24 , @entity25			1
" i have asked the @entity27 to vote in favor of the publication of the 2018/2022 inquiry report by the investigatory chamber , " said @entity4 president @entity26			1
@entity26 also insisted that there would not be a re-vote on the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 @entity35 to @entity6 and @entity8 respectively			0
" the report is about history and i am focused on the future , " added @entity26 while referring to the recommendation made by @entity37 , @entity4 's head of compliance			1
" we will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent , external legal experts commissioned by mr. @entity37 supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the @entity51 's decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 @entity35			2
" we are already in the process of incorporating recommendations made by independent experts including the ethics committee for how the @entity5 selection process can be improved so that everyone can be confident that the 2026 bidding process will be fair , ethical and open			2
" in a press conference which followed his statement , he added : " it would really need an earthquake , extremely important new elements to go back on this @entity5 in @entity8			0
" @entity4 says it will confirm the dates for the @entity5 in @entity8 at its next executive committee meeting in @entity67 in march			2
it is expected to be held in the winter with fears over the intense heat in the @entity71			0
meanwhile , the report will not be published until current investigations into five individuals are completed , and it 's expected to be heavily redacted			1
three members of the committee -- @entity78 's @entity77 ­ a @entity79 , @entity80 , of @entity81 and @entity83 's @entity82 -- were being investigated by @entity14 for either alleged code breaches during the bidding process or for failing to comply with his probe @entity88 , who led the inspection team visiting the candidates to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments and former @entity93 @entity5 winner @entity92 are also facing charges from the @entity4 ethics committee which both men have denied			1
@entity26 also confirmed that @entity14 has been replaced by his deputy , @entity98 © ly , who he describes as " an outstanding lawyer "			1
" it is important that the work of the ethics committee continues and that any instances of wrongdoing are fully investigated and their perpetrators pursued and sanctioned , " said @entity26			0
" i have been informed that various cases against individuals for alleged rule violations have been opened by the investigatory chamber and are currently under review by the adjudicatory chamber			0
" the organization fully supports the rigorous pursuit of these cases			0
and , while @entity4 as an organization does not have prosecutorial powers , we have provided information and the full report from mr. @entity14 to the @entity67 general @entity119 and have pledged our cooperation			1
" @entity122 , head of @entity123 , the @entity124 governing body , also welcomed the decision to publish the report			2
" it was important that the @entity130 decided today to publish the @entity14 report , " he said on @entity127 via his spokesman , @entity128			1
" i have always battled for transparency and this is a step in the right direction			0
" let us hope that the report can now be published as quickly as possible			2
the credibility of @entity4 depends on it			2
" the move comes just days after @entity14 resigned from his role citing a " lack of leadership " at the top of world football 's governing body			1
@entity14 quit following @entity4 's rejection of his appeal after he had launched a complaint about how his report had been summarized by @entity148 -- @entity4 's independent ethics judge			1
" i disagree with the @entity156 's decision , " said the @entity151 lawyer -- now chairman of the @entity152 of the @entity153 -- in a public statement			1
" it now appears that , at least for the foreseeable future , the @entity158 will stand as the final word on the 2018 and @entity162 bidding process			0
" no independent governance committee , investigator , or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization			0
" @entity26 said he was surprised by @entity14 's resignation but that the " work of the @entity153 will nonetheless continue			1
" " pending the election of a new chairman of the @entity153 by the @entity173 , the @entity130 will appoint an acting chairman to serve as a replacement for mr @entity14 , " added @entity26 , who will be at @entity27 's meeting in @entity24 on thursday and friday			2
@entity14 's decision to leave his role came following months of frustration for the @entity180 attorney			1
in september , when he completed his report , he spoke out and declared that it should be made public but with redactions to ensure witness confidentiality was not compromised			1
@entity4 rejected his request on the grounds that witness confidentiality for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published and threatened to sanction him for his outburst			2
then @entity148 published his summary , prompting @entity14 to respond by saying the @entity93 judge 's 42 - page report contained " numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations			1
" @entity4 has been under increasing pressure from the media and football fans to publish the report and embrace a period of reform			1
sponsors such as @entity202 and @entity203 have both gone public with their grievances over @entity4 's lack of transparency , while @entity207 will not be renewing its deal when it ends at the end of this year			1
widespread skepticism over the way @entity6 and @entity8 won the rights to host the next two tournaments remain , despite both countries being cleared of any wrongdoing by @entity148 's summary			0
both @entity6 and @entity8 have always denied they were involved in any wrongdoing during the bidding process			0
the outcome of the vote is unlikely to hinder @entity26 's chances of retaining the presidency when the elections are held in may			0
@entity26 , who is 78 , is poised to win a fifth term in office and faces little opposition with votes from @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 already assured			0
@entity123 has yet to publicly back a candidate , but it has distanced itself from the bid by @entity235 @entity234 , the only man to have publicly announced his plan to stand against @entity26			0
@entity237 , the @entity123 president , has ruled out running against @entity26 but there is now a race against time for his organization to thrown their weight behind a candidate			0
one option for @entity123 would be @entity245 , the @entity246 prince , who is also a vice-president of @entity4			2
@entity245 is one of the most forward thinking members of the @entity27 and publicly backed the publishing of the report			0
yet @entity245 could be thwarted by his own confederation by the @entity229 , which has already pledged its support to @entity26			0
if @entity245 is unable to secure the support of his own confederation it would mean his challenge would be over before it had even begun .			0

@entity4 will publish @entity14 's report into world *cup*
redacted version will be made available to public
