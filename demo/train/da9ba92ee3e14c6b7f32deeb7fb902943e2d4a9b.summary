@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 will not lose his re-election bid because of @entity5			1
as sensational as the headlines surrounding the @entity9 controversy might be , recent history tells us @entity5 is only the topic of conversation right now			2
come july , we 'll forget all about it much in the way the @entity15 is hardly mentioned			0
remember , it was just last week that all of the talk was about immigration and the @entity21 vote			0
the week before that , it was same - sex marriages			0
so @entity5 -- and the rest of those those sexy subplots -- are really just there to keep us entertained until the main event , the only event that matters leading to the election : the first debate			2
everything before that will will likely fade away by november , especially for independents			0
it 's what happens when @entity3 and @entity36 finally square off on wednesday , october 3 , that will have the greatest influence on those who are undecided			1
the candidates will debate at the @entity41 , in the first of three planned presidential debates			2
but you know the old saying : the first impression is the last impression			0
so if @entity3 stumbles in the first , he might as well spend the rest of the fall packing			2
@entity50 knows this , which is why what we saw in the @entity56 primary debates is not what we 're going to see in october			0
back then , @entity36 came across flat and on the defensive in the first debate , but this time expect him to come out swinging , questioning nearly every decision the president has ever made -- from cash for clunkers and bailouts to health care reform and the stimulus package			1
the presumptive @entity56 nominee wo n't have to knock @entity3 out , but if the night ends with the president appearing to be on the back of his of his heels , the game is over			1
after all , what could he possibly say in the next two debates or on the campaign trail that would erase an image of him struggling to defend his own record ? especially against a guy who continues to struggle to be liked , much in the same way a rigid @entity82 struggled against the charismatic @entity83 , the wooden @entity79 paled next to the friendly demeanor of @entity85 and listless @entity86 could n't come close to igniting the crowd like @entity3 in 2008			1
but to complicate things , @entity3 is defending his record against a man who is not afraid to distort the facts ( i.e. lie ) to win brownie points			1
that 's not my opinion , that 's what the people who currently endorse @entity36 said			0
after a debate in @entity101 , @entity99 said @entity36 gave " the most blatantly dishonest performance by a presidential candidate i 've ever seen			1
" earlier , @entity104 said he was " stunned that @entity36 does not have the ability to discern something that is blatantly false			0
" on top of that , @entity3 has to find a way to remind the country where it was before he took office without appearing to be blaming former president @entity85 because , fair or not , people do n't want to hear it			1
and unlike the backdrop of 2008 , @entity3 does n't have the luxury of speaking in generic hypotheticals because the country will have specific examples in 2012 to look at			2
and not a teleprompter in sight			0
just @entity36 , the list of promises @entity3 made in 2008 and his list of accomplishments heading into the stretch run of 2012			1
if he 's re-elected , it wo n't be based on how he handles gaffes or controversies such as @entity9			1
it will be because he took the @entity56 's best shot and came out on top on the one night doing so mattered most			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			0

the @entity9 *scandal* wo n't determine if @entity3 is re-elected
@entity135 says the *key* event will be the first presidential debate on october 3
he says @entity36 will go after the president with every *criticism* he can *muster*
@entity135 : @entity3 will be judged on how well he defends his record
