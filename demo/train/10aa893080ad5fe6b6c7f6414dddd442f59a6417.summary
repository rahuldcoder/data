-- in the age of short attention spans and mass media hopping from one story to the next , it is fairly remarkable that the shooting death of @entity7 one year ago tuesday continues to resonate among the consciousness of many @entity9			1
most of this is because a dedicated group of activists , bloggers , social media afficionadios and members of the media -- mostly the black press -- have been diligent in ensuring that what took place on a cool , rainy night in @entity21 , @entity22 , deserves to be brought out into the open and not to become a drive - by media story			1
and no doubt the vigilance of @entity7 's parents -- @entity27 and @entity28 -- has made it hard for people to forget			1
since @entity7 was shot and killed after an altercation with @entity32 , a one - man neighborhood watch guy , @entity34 and @entity7 have attended many high - profile events like the @entity36 and the @entity37 , walking red carpets and telling anyone who would listen that their son should not have died and there was no justice			1
news : parents ready to let jury decide fate of son 's killer they have been shepherded through this process by their attorney , @entity51 , who has transformed his law practice into a 2013 version of what @entity54 -- famed criminal defense attorney -- was when he was the go - to guy for national social justice legal cases			0
@entity51 has become the guy that black parents call when their children , mostly young men , have been shot and killed			0
even though the trial of @entity32 wo n't take place until june -- almost 16 months after the fatal shooting of @entity7 -- a lot of things have changed and are in the process of being debated			2
first , while everyone continues to focus on @entity32 and whether he will invoke a @entity70 defense , efforts are under way in the @entity72 and other states to get rid of such laws , or change them			1
@entity22 democratic state rep. @entity76 has introduced a bill in the legislature that would do away with the @entity70 defense , which law enforcement personnel and district attorneys have said makes their job harder in prosecuting shootings			1
many believe the @entity22 legislature wo n't overturn the law , but changes have been bandied about by the @entity89 majority , which is a good thing			2
the death of @entity7 exposed the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) , a shadowy , corporate - funded group that has been one of the leading forces behind stand - your - ground laws			1
once the light hit them , their involvement in other issues , such as voter id laws , was made public			2
the alec is one of those nondescript groups that were formed to assist corporations to fight tax policies and to advance an economic agenda			0
but then they use their war chest to expand into other controversial areas , like stand your ground laws			0
it was n't until @entity112 led petition drives for major corporations to pull out of @entity91 that the group disbanded some of their other efforts			0
had the consciousness not been raised after @entity7 's death , @entity91 would probably still be going about their business writing and pushing for laws that are unjust to many @entity9			1
@entity7 's death also awakened the inner fighting spirit of many young people , as well as african - americans in sports and entertainment			1
when the @entity126 donned black hoodies to show their solidarity with those who protested @entity7 's death , that represented one of the biggest examples of today 's sports stars standing up for a social cause			1
black history is replete with individuals who made it clear that life was n't all about sports			0
@entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 were athletes who refused to hide away in the locker room			0
they used their platforms to speak about societal ills , and bridged the gap between activism and entertainment			0
opinion : what we can learn from @entity7 shooting the likes of @entity156 , @entity157 and so many others in @entity159 have answered the call of activist - entertainer @entity161 to use their celebrity for more than just the next project			2
they have gone down to @entity22 to stand in solidarity with @entity7 's parents and bring attention to the issues surrounding his death			1
but what is most needed -- more than just keeping the focus on @entity7 -- is for his death to spark an uprising of awareness and consciousness , maybe similar to what @entity176 's death did in 1955			1
@entity176 's lynching death in @entity179 helped spark the @entity180 , which radically altered the course of this nation			2
it 's time for @entity9 to move beyond the mind - set of me , myself and i , and understand that this is about we , us and our			0
for every @entity7 , there are thousands of others who do n't get the media attention , but they deserve justice , too			2
this is n't about black or white ; it 's about what 's right and wrong ; fair and unfair			0
no matter what happens in the trial of @entity32 , those who marched , protested , tweeted , facebooked , lit candles and wore hoodies know that without all of that collective action , @entity32 would be walking around free and would have never seen the inside of a courtroom			0
stand - your - ground laws would exist with nary a peep of opposition ; and we would all be living our lives as if all is good			0
one young man ended up dead in @entity21 , @entity22 , on the night of the @entity214 all - star game , but a heckuva whole lot has changed for the better as a result			1
@entity7 did not die in vain			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			0
