-- as special - operations military troops prepared for a firefight about 7,000 miles away , president @entity1 entered a room in the @entity6 area early in the afternoon on sunday to follow along			1
like a page plucked from a @entity9 screenplay , @entity1 and other principal coordinators for the mission that killed @entity12 convened in a " situation room " to remotely monitor the situation , @entity15 , the @entity16 counterterrorism chief , said in a @entity18 news briefing on monday			1
@entity1 arrived after many of the mission 's leaders had assembled there , but the president joined before the attack on @entity12 's mansion in @entity26 , @entity27 , began , @entity15 said			1
" we were able to monitor on a real - time basis the progress of the operation , from its commencement , to its time on target , to the extraction of the remains , " @entity15 said			0
" we were able to have regular updates to ensure that we had real - time visibility into the progress of the operation			0
" the mood in the room was anxious because the stakes were so high , @entity15 said			0
" there were some very tense moments , " he said			0
" we were just saying our prayers that everything would go according to plan			0
" the @entity18 and @entity48 did n't have access to a live audio feed , but they were able to tap other communications , a @entity16 official told @entity0			1
there was some live video , though the official declined to elaborate on the nature of that footage			1
the @entity57 reported that the @entity48 had led the @entity12 attack operation , and officials on the 7th floor of the agency 's @entity62 , @entity64 , headquarters had access to live video of the raid , the report said			1
@entity15 declined to say whether they had access to a video feed or radio communications			2
a @entity18 spokesman declined to comment			2
@entity73 , @entity74 and other @entity76 companies have mastered the process of streaming live video from events to the world			2
but that task would get much trickier if the cameramen are also carrying rifles and broadcasting from an untested , faraway locale			0
after @entity1 had signed off on the operation , cia director @entity86 gave the official order around midday sunday for the operation to commence , the @entity57 reported			1
" we have rid the world of the most infamous terrorist of our time , " @entity86 said in a statement monday			0
" we gave president @entity1 and his team accurate , relevant , timely intelligence -- providing the information and insight they needed at key points as this mission developed			1
" the @entity48 had been tracking @entity12 and provided intelligence to the @entity18 saying the agency was " confident " the terrorist leader was inside the @entity27 compound , @entity15 said			1
" it was probably one of the most anxiety - filled periods of time , i think , in the lives of the people who were assembled here yesterday , " @entity15 said			0
" the minutes passed like days , and the president was very concerned about the security of our personnel			2
that was what was on his mind throughout			0
" shortly after taking office in 2009 , @entity1 had directed @entity86 " to make the killing or capture of @entity12 the top priority of our war against @entity128 , " the president said in his speech sunday night			1
" we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who 've worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome			2
the @entity16 people do not see their work , nor know their names			0
" however , @entity1 apparently does get to see their work as it 's being carried out			2
