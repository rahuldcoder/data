-- as part of the investigation into the remains of 11 women found inside and outside the @entity7 , @entity8 , home of a registered sex offender , police have turned to the self - described " bug guy			1
" @entity11 , curator of invertebrate zoology from the @entity13 , started consulting with law enforcement in 2001			0
his job is to identify the bugs found on bodies and determine their age , to help police determine the " post-mortem interval " : the time between death and body discovery			1
it 's a grisly task but a useful one , as it can help police determine a timeline for deaths			1
bugs " can be the most important evidence when it comes to pinpointing a timeline , " @entity11 said , adding that bugs ' sense of smell " puts bloodhounds to shame			1
" and in this case , with 11 deaths -- each with their own mystery -- bugs could play a huge role in helping investigators figure out how and when each of these bodies ended up at the home of @entity46 , 50			1
from the beginning , @entity11 was involved in the case of the remains found at @entity46 's home			1
all the remains are of @entity55 - @entity54 women , police said			1
all that remains of one victim is a skull , wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement			2
police conducted an additional search at @entity46 's home and an adjacent property wednesday , @entity7 police lt. @entity62 said			1
although " various items " were removed , no more remains were found , he said			1
police had used ground - penetrating radar to analyze the properties			2
@entity46 , who served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape , now faces five counts of aggravated murder , rape , felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths			0
typically , @entity11 said , he requires three weeks to a month to complete a report on one body , but in the @entity46 case , he hopes to have an initial report completed " before @entity85			2
... it is n't going to be a three - week process			0
" the difference between one bug and another can be " minute , " with some of them looking " very similar , " he said			0
but the minute difference can be huge in terms of bug species , as different species can tell very different stories about the time of death			0
for instance , there are only a few dozen species of flies in his part of @entity8 , he said , but the presence or absence of each one can tell a story , since each has a different rate of growth in varying temperatures			1
temperature will be a factor in this case , he said , because some of the bodies were found inside and others outside			1
@entity11 said he 'll need to determine what effect the bodies being " hidden " will have on the bugs he finds , as well			2
in research done with dead pigs , he said , bugs will cover the pig 's face within an hour			0
@entity11 said his job is to be " meticulous , " as any mistakes can disrupt an investigation			0
preliminary information is generally not useful , he said , so he has not spoken to police or the coroner regarding any of his findings			0
asked how exact his findings will be concerning time of death , he declined to answer , saying that would mean giving specifics on the conditions of the bodies when they were found			2
he said only that he believes he can do " better than years " in trying to pinpoint a time of death for each victim			0
" this is a singular situation that i hope is once in a lifetime , " he said of the @entity46 case			0
" this is something , for the sake of our society , i hope i never have to do again			0
" @entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

consultant identifies bugs found on bodies and determines their age
