-- sunday night marked the first time we 've heard from @entity3 since her most recent stint in rehab , in her eagerly awaited pow wow with @entity7			1
in the course of an hour , there was some " pow " and a bit of " wow " for those of us used to seeing the young actress as a troubled starlet			0
@entity3 appeared coherent and comfortable answering questions on " @entity18 , " where she started out being clear that she wanted to share her truth			1
filmed four days after @entity3 left her sixth rehab , the interview kicked off @entity7 's own network 's @entity3 programming , which will also include a reality docu - series about @entity3 's attempt to get her life back on track			1
looking healthier than fans have seen her in a while , @entity3 wore a tangerine - colored form - fitting dress , her hair pulled back in a ponytail and light make - up			1
she referred to herself as an " addict " almost immediately and discussed everything from her drug of choice to her relationship with her parents			1
since 7 is a lucky number and so many are wishing her the best , here are the 7 things we learned from the show : 1 ) @entity3 secretly wished to go to jail that first time @entity7 reminds us that on july 6 , 2010 , @entity3 violated her probation after missing her alcohol counseling sessions			1
she was sentenced to 90 days in jail , but only served two weeks because of jail overcrowding			0
the actress said that being an addict and surrounded by so much chaos made her " kind of want " to go to jail			2
" i think it was just to have some peace and just have no choice but to just sit and be , " @entity3 told @entity7			1
" i 'll never forget that moment ( of being sentenced )			0
" 2 ) alcohol is her drug of choice , not cocaine according to @entity3 , booze is way more of a problem for her than cocaine , despite the many jokes bandied about to the contrary			1
@entity3 told @entity7 she has only done cocaine " 10 to 15 times " and never really enjoyed snorting it			1
the attraction of the drug , she said , was that it allowed her to drink more			0
" ( @entity72 ) was like a party thing			0
people would have it and i would do it , " she said			0
" it went hand in hand with drinking			0
" @entity3 also revealed that she 's no longer on @entity81 , and did not use the stimulant to control her weight			1
but , she said , " it did ground me			0
" these days , @entity3 said the only pills she takes are vitamins and @entity87 , for acid reflux			1
3 ) she admits that she 's been a mess @entity3 said she hates being known - as @entity7 put it - " as an adjective and verb for bad behavior and child star gone wrong			1
" it 's not at all what @entity3 said she aspired to be			2
she says her reputation for being late on set , among other famous complaints , came from her being " so distracted in the past that i was n't on point with that			2
" but she believes she can turn it around			0
" as long as i stay honest with myself and just do the work that i am willing to do , and have been willing to do and am doing , there 's nothing that can stand in the way of that , " @entity3 said			2
" i 'm my own worst enemy and i know that			0
" 4 ) her troubles started with " @entity112 " after the success of multiple films , including " @entity115 " and " @entity116 : fully loaded , " @entity3 was making $ 7 million a picture			1
she said it was after she hit it even bigger in 2004 's " @entity112 " that she decided to move to @entity120			0
that spelled trouble for the then - 18 - year - old , as she said she was reckless with her money and vulnerable to the hangers - on who surrounded her			0
in response to @entity7 's query as who was there to guide her then , the actress shrugged and said " no one really , when i think about it			2
" 5 ) @entity3 is very spiritual " i feel whole again , " @entity3 told @entity7 of how she 's feeling post this last trip to rehab			1
" i 'm a very spiritual person and i 've become more spiritual as time has gone on , " @entity3 said			2
" i 'm really in touch , whether it 's prayer or meditation ... there are so many powers greater than me in the world			0
i 've been blessed and lucky enough to have been given a gift to share with other people			0
" 6 ) she does n't blame her parents @entity3 maintained that she loves her parents and is close with them both , despite the time her father secretly taped a phone call during which @entity3 accused her mother of drug use			1
@entity150 made the tape public and it quickly went viral			0
@entity3 said she lied to her father during that conversation			2
it was after a fight with her mother and @entity3 said she was " acting out			2
" she said she was unsure as to why her father " betrayed " her , but said her parents now get along			2
" i hate the bad rap that people give my parents , " @entity3 said			1
" because they are just parents , really , at the end of the day trying to stand up for their daughter and themselves			2
" her parents are not responsible for her poor choices , she said			0
still , she has since asked her parents to keep their lives private			0
7 ) " i am different " @entity3 said she understands that she 's perceived as someone who has been given chance after chance , but she expressed what seemed to be a sincere desire to return to work , or as @entity3 calls acting , " the thing that has made me happiest my whole life			1
" she told @entity7 that she is ready to " work really hard and stay focused and prove myself in the way that i did before in the past and i lost			2
i have to regain the trust of people in my career that have their doubts and i fully respect that on their behaf			0
" when @entity7 asked about @entity3 's upcoming trip to @entity181 and whether that would be a good idea so soon after rehab , @entity3 thought she could handle it			1
i 'm in a different headspace			0
i do n't want those things that i wanted before , " she said			0
days after the interview taped , @entity3 canceled her trip			1
" it 's a process of growing up and recognizing and being just so tired and exhausted by the chaos , which is what it really is , " @entity3 said in the interview			1
" i have had no right in my past to complain about being followed by cameras and people making up stories , but there 's something to be said about me moving forward			0
