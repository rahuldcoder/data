-- in an outrageous recent fundraising letter the @entity1 solicited funds from the party faithful on the grounds that the @entity1 was the last remaining bulwark against a series of anti-election - fraud initiatives " in more than 40 states			1
" that 's right , the @entity1 appears to be standing up for potential fraud â € ” presumably because ending it would disenfranchise at least two of its core constituencies : the deceased and double - voters			1
across @entity18 , @entity17 and @entity1 legislatures have put forth voter identification laws this year to protect the constitutional values of equal protection and one person one vote , and for good reason			1
election fraud is a real and persistent threat to our electoral system , with allegations cropping up in every election cycle			1
just in december , for example , a prosecutor in @entity32 launched an investigation into allegations that some fraudulent signatures on petitions may have allowed president @entity38 to get on the ballot in that state 's 2008 primary			0
unsurprisingly , 69 % of 1,000 likely voters , according to a recent @entity44 poll , believe voters should be required to show photo identification before being allowed to vote			1
but @entity47 in @entity48 disagree			2
and in their fundraising letter they even went so far as to reference the despicable @entity52 laws of the segregated @entity53			1
@entity54 , the @entity1 's counsel and voter protection director , wrote , " republicans are introducing and passing laws that make voting more difficult			1
" he went on , " if that infuriates you ... there 's something you can do right now			0
help us keep up the fight by donating to support @entity47			1
" but the @entity1 's premise is fundamentally flawed			0
it rests on the assumption that it is harder for certain groups of voters to cast their ballots because they do n't have access to proper identification			0
this overlooks the fact that states include provisions to provide free identification cards to those who ca n't afford them			0
moreover , a study for the @entity82 , a conservative think tank , reported that voter participation increased for the 2008 election in states such as @entity32 and @entity86 , even after the passage of stronger elections laws			1
the disastrous results that opponents predicted never materialized			0
voter identification laws are common sense and an effective way to combat election fraud			1
and , according to the @entity18 @entity96 , they are constitutional			0
in 2008 , the court upheld @entity32 's voter id law , saying it could find no evidence that the new requirements burdened voters			1
and that all raises the question : why the hostile letter from the @entity1 ? i 'm afraid it may reveal something very disturbing : @entity47 know they benefit from election fraud			1
consider the sordid tale of the liberal organization @entity109 , the @entity109			0
in 2008 , @entity109 was responsible for 400,000 faulty voter registrations , including those of deceased individuals , nonresidents , previously registered voters and fictional characters			1
other voter fraud allegations surfaced in at least 10 states			2
that same year , the outcome of the election in many states was determined by a fraction of that many votes			0
in other words , fraudulent registrations have the potential for significant consequences			0
and here 's the thing to remember : @entity109 's political arm enthusiastically supported @entity38 's candidacy , and @entity47 have long defended the organization			2
there are other examples of faulty or fraudulent voting			1
in the 2010 midterms , 5,000 non-citizens voted in the @entity138 race , according to a study by the @entity140			0
it also found that 12,000 non-citizens were registered to vote in @entity143			0
in @entity147 , an analysis of @entity146 data earlier this year revealed that 14 counties have more registered voters than voting - age residents , due in part , one county clerk said , to slowness in purging voter rolls when residents move			1
in my home state of @entity159 , recent legislation attempted to curb voting irregularities , which were of such concern that the @entity162 commissioned an unprecedented two - year investigation			2
the 2008 report warned that some instances of illegal voting in the 2004 election left open the possibility of an " illegal organized attempt to influence the outcome " of a state election			2
in an effort to show that voter fraud is not isolated to a handful of states , the @entity172 recently began documenting known cases of voter fraud			1
to date , they have found at least one documented case of fraud in each of 46 states over the last decade			0
and no one knows how many instances of fraud go unnoticed			0
if not , fraud will dilute the power of the individual 's vote and destroy the integrity of our system			0
the sole purpose of voter identification laws is to avoid that fate			2
the right of every citizen to have a vote must be vigorously defended , and these laws protect that right			0
no matter what @entity48 @entity47 say , there is absolutely no evidence that anyone has , or would be , disenfranchised			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity207 says @entity47 fundraising letter opposes @entity17 moves to curb election fraud
he said it gives the impression the @entity17 is trying to disenfranchise voters
he says likely voters polled want voters to show photo id ; high court has upheld @entity218 law
*priebus* : voter id laws are common sense , effective way to fight faulty and fraudulent voting
