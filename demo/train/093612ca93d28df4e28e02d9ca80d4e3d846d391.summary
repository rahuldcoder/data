@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 groups from all corners of the party are reluctantly starting to pour money into this traditionally red state to try to save the incumbent @entity4 senator -- and lock down their prospects of taking control of the @entity12			1
the @entity1 - based @entity14 brothers , who have so far engaged minimally here , are poised to step up their efforts to help sen. @entity17 , according to sources familiar with their plans			1
worried that @entity17 could lose the @entity4 seat in their backyard , the @entity14 founded and funded group , @entity23 , plans to increase its activity in the last weeks of the campaign			1
@entity27 , another conservative group with ties to the @entity14 brothers , already spent nearly $ 1 million in television ads to help @entity17 and plans another buy before election day			1
other outside groups that hoped to spend campaign cash at this time to defeat incumbent democrats are also now coming in big to defend this @entity4 seat			0
until recently , @entity4 thought they 'd only have to play defense in @entity37 and @entity38 , where @entity35 have mounted competitive @entity12 campaigns			2
but @entity35 candidate @entity41 's abrupt decision to drop out of the @entity1 race last month transformed the election here into an unexpected head - to - head contest between @entity17 and independent @entity46			1
@entity46 has said he will caucus with whatever party is in the majority , but @entity4 do n't want to take any chances			0
they saw a @entity4 @entity12 takeover within their reach in the last two elections , 2010 and 2012 , only to be snatched away -- mostly by intra @entity4 fighting and candidate missteps			0
ruby red @entity1 has not elected a @entity56 to the @entity12 in over 80 years , but @entity17 is under attack for a cardinal sin in politics -- losing touch with the people back home			1
@entity63 came in to help overcome that image to win a tough primary fight , and he is now up against @entity46 -- a businessman who is successfully appealing to voters as outside @entity67 and outside the two party system			0
the @entity69 , founded by billionaire businessman @entity70 , announced it is pouring more than $ 1 million dollars into @entity1 for television and radio ads over the next several weeks , and is poised to spend more if needed			2
on friday the group released one of those ads , first shared with @entity2 , which casts @entity46 as a liberal who 's " masquerading " as an independent			0
@entity77 , who runs the group , tells @entity2 they saw polling that showed @entity17 in trouble , and worry that his opponent , independent @entity46 , is really an " @entity56 masquerading as an @entity82			1
" @entity46 ran as a @entity56 in the past , but has given money to and voted for candidates in both parties			0
" we think its crazy to leave the @entity12 majority to someone who wo n't come clean to the people of @entity1 about what he stands for , " said @entity77 , referring to the fact that @entity46 is cagey about who he will caucus with if he wins , and if his decision determines which party controls the @entity12			1
@entity77 was an aide to former @entity1 senator @entity96 , a close friend of @entity17 who is working behind the scenes as well as in public to pull @entity17 over the finish line			2
the @entity101 @entity100 , which played a major role helping incumbent @entity4 in the @entity4 primary season , is also about to " go big " in @entity1 for @entity17 , according to a source familiar with their plans			2
in a preview earlier this week , @entity17 appeared with the @entity108 to receive its endorsement			0
update : an initial version of this story did n't include the proper name for @entity69 and misquoted its president , @entity77			0
@entity2 's @entity115 contributed to this report			0

@entity14 - founded group will increase efforts to support sen. @entity17 in final weeks of the campaign
@entity12 race is *suddenly* competitive
@entity1 has n't sent a @entity56 to the @entity12 in 80 years
