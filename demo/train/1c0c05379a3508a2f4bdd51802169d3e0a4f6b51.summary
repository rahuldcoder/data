@entity0 -- the president of @entity3 , the business at the heart of @entity7 's nuclear crisis , apologized again wednesday , a day after the situation there was designated a @entity11 - level nuclear accident			1
@entity12 , the president of the power company , also said he is working with the government to create a plan to privide short - term compensation to the many affected by the nuclear crisis			1
" i regret the fact we are inconveniencing all these people , i want to take this opportunity to apologize , " @entity12 said			0
his speech comes after @entity7 's prime minister vowed to wind down the month - long crisis at the @entity27 power plant " at all costs			1
" prime minister @entity29 said he wants @entity3 , to produce a timetable for bringing the disaster to an end , " and they will be doing that soon			1
" @entity12 did not provide a detailed timetable during his speech wednesday but said his company is working to stop harmful materials from going into the atmosphere " as soon as possible			0
" @entity7 declared the @entity27 crisis a level 7 event on the international system for rating nuclear accidents tuesday , putting it on par with the @entity11 in the @entity43			1
the top - scale designation was based on the massive release of radioactivity since the accident began , particularly in its early days , and classifies @entity27 a " major accident " requiring long - term countermeasures			1
" at all costs , all the reactors and the spent nuclear fuel pools must be brought under control so that we can prevent a further expansion of the damage , " @entity29 said			0
@entity57 , a former nuclear engineer - turned - industry critic , told @entity1 the declaration has no immediate practical impact on the crisis			2
but it 's a sign that @entity7 regulators have rethought their earlier assessments of the disaster , said @entity57 , who now runs an alternative energy think - tank in @entity0			2
@entity12 already issued an apology tuesday for the disaster and the " enormous anxiety " it has caused after the level 7 designation			1
" we would like to stabilize the situation as soon as possible , and we are working on the measures and steps to cool the reactors and prevent the spread of nuclear substances , " he said			0
" while continuing to ask for the support and cooperation of the government , the ministries , and the municipalities , we would like to maintain close communication with them , and we will make the utmost effort to bring the situation to an end			0
" scientists believe the amount of radiation released is only a tenth of what was released at @entity11 , said @entity93 , the chief spokesman for @entity7 's @entity94			1
but the levels for radioactive iodine and cesium that have been spewed into the air , water and soil around the plant are in the thousands of trillions of bequerels -- 15 times higher than the threshold for a top - scale event , according to figures released by the safety agency tuesday morning			0
the crisis began with the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern @entity7			2
the tsunami knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , leaving operators with no way to keep the three operational reactors from overheating after they shut down			0
engineers are now pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the damaged reactors to keep them cool , but @entity3 said long - term solutions must wait until it can get the highly contaminated water out of the basements of the units ' turbine plants			1
in addition , more water is being poured into pools housing spent but still - potent fuel rods in units 1 - 3 as well as unit 4 , which had no fuel in the reactor at the time of the quake			0
the work has been complicated over the past five days by a series of powerful aftershocks that have forced workers to clear out of the units and seek shelter			0
evacuation orders have so far covered about 85,000 people inside the 20 - kilometer ( 12.4 - mile ) zone , while another 62,000 within 30 kilometers have been told to stay inside , @entity27 prefecture officials told @entity1			2
@entity7 's government said it had no estimate of the number of people who would be covered by the new directives			1
@entity151 , the country 's chief cabinet secretary , added outdoor - grown shiitake mushrooms from 16 towns and villages neighboring the @entity27 plant to the country 's banned food list wednesday			2
@entity1 's @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
