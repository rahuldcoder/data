it was an innocent mistake , one that was easy to correct -- before the social media age			0
miss @entity4 and miss @entity6 were at an event in @entity9 with fellow 2006 @entity11 contestants as part of the whirlwind of photo opps leading up the annual beauty contest			1
it was in the middle of the 2006 @entity6 - @entity19 war , and a picture of the two women together landed on the @entity11 press page , stirring panic among the women and their handlers			1
the incident came to mind last weekend when a photo on @entity31 of the current miss @entity6 and miss @entity4 together stirred controversy online anew , @entity27 president @entity26 said			1
in 2006 , the organization was able to remove the photo before anyone noticed , @entity26 said			2
now , thanks to social media , we 're in a " whole new ballgame			0
" slips in decorum that previously might have gone unnoticed now have the potential to be amplified beyond anyone 's control			2
in this case , the backlash prompted miss @entity46 to issue a statement distancing herself from the photo			1
many in the @entity50 dismissed the controversy as a trifling matter			0
@entity46 and miss @entity6 @entity53 weathered the controversy and went on to represent their countries in the pageant , which aired sunday night on @entity57			1
miss @entity59 @entity58 won the crown			2
but pageant observers say the incident is a reminder that beauty pageants embody global politics , with contestants expected to model the cultural sensibilities of their nations			1
" they are cast with representing their country and as such they are expected to behave much like ambassadors , " said @entity69 , an assistant professor with the @entity70 at @entity71 and the 2007 @entity73 pageant winner representing @entity74			1
' a delicate diplomatic dance ' the @entity31 controversy is the latest example showing that pageants occur " in a broader international context , " @entity69 said in a @entity84 column last week			2
@entity85 came under fire as @entity11 host country in 2013 for not granting visas to contestants from countries it did not recognize , including @entity92 , @entity26 said			1
contestants threatened to boycott the 2002 @entity95 pageant scheduled in @entity96 after a mother was sentenced to death for having sex outside marriage			1
organizers moved the pageant to @entity103			2
" with so many nations and so much politics , planners must choreograph a delicate diplomatic dance , " said @entity104 , creator of pageant - watch website @entity106 , which shares information on international pageants and beauty queens			1
geopolitical affairs affect various aspects of pageant planning , @entity26 said			2
for example , geographic neighbors @entity85 and @entity119 are traditionally assigned as roommates -- but not this year			0
behind the scenes , @entity11 contestants tend to get along , or , at the very least , are civil and courteous , @entity26 said			1
after all , each woman is representing her country on a global stage			1
for many , it 's the first time they ever leave their country			2
" as people , they genuinely like each other but they need to be cognizant that they are wearing a sash representing their country , " she said			0
" obviously , certain countries have inherent hostilities , and i encourage contestants to talk to each other but i do not have them room together			0
" it 's easy for @entity142 to brush aside the @entity31 controversy , said @entity144 , executive director of the @entity145 in @entity146			0
but with regular cross-border hostilities between @entity6 and @entity4 , it 's not surprising that the appearance of " normalized relations " between representatives of those countries might offend some in the region			1
" politics enters into things like this , unfortunately			0
it should n't be this way but when conditions are so bad and you have two countries at war with each other , everything becomes political , " she said			0
if not for social media , however , the incident probably would not have made international headlines , she said			0
" that 's what happens with social media ; it 's the tendency of a hashtag to be more meaningful than substance of what actually took place , " she said			0
" it 's significant burden to place on women in their 20s			0
" ' everything is political ' miss @entity4 2002 @entity182 has experienced that burden firsthand			1
her country decided to skip the @entity185 after @entity187 troops swept through a refugee camp in @entity189 , leading to allegations from @entity192 officials of a massacre			0
a @entity195 report found evidence of possible war crimes , but the group 's investigators found no evidence that @entity187 troops massacred @entity192 civilians			0
meanwhile , @entity203 , @entity6 's 2002 @entity11 delegate , stoked controversy at the competition with a dress displaying the @entity187 state that included the disputed territories of @entity209 and @entity210 , according to multiple news reports from the time			1
in an email to @entity0 on friday through her publicist , @entity182 said she " felt bad " about missing the 2002 competition			0
but , as a representative of her country , she understood and respected the official decision			0
" i think that beauty queens have a message of culture and peace to deliver and this is where real beauty is , " she said			0
" but , unfortunately , we live in a world full of atrocities , wars , injustice , and occupation and seen under that perspective , a beauty queen has to understand and respect her country 's laws and political positions			1
" @entity182 represented her country in other pageants			2
they were different settings , but the expectations were the same : treat your competitors with respect , but always be on guard against situations " that might put you in a difficult position			0
" " while it is easy to say forget politics , it is just beauty , it is just a pageant ; unfortunately we who live here know that everything is political when it comes to your country 's sovereignty and borders			1
