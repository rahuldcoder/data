-- @entity1 knows she wo n't win a medal at the @entity3			1
she is n't likely to get beyond the first round of the 800 meters			1
but for the 20 - year - old and her three teammates , just competing under the @entity8 flag is a source of pride			1
the appearance itself is controversial : the @entity13 does not recognize a @entity8 state but athletes have been allowed to compete under a @entity8 flag by the @entity17 and soccer 's ruling body @entity18 since 1996 and 1998 respectively			1
" it means a lot for me that i am female and representing @entity23 , " she told @entity0 's @entity21			2
" i will represent my hometown @entity24 , @entity23 and my university			0
" @entity24 is a village of fewer than 10,000 inhabitants in the northern @entity27 , where protests and tear gas form part of everyday life in a region still fighting for independence from @entity33 after two decades of struggle			0
@entity1 , who will be immediately recognizable by her black headscarf , long - sleeved top and long trousers , knows that when she steps up to the line in @entity39 , she wo n't just be representing herself			1
" this will reflect on my female friends and on sports in @entity23 , " she said			0
" maybe the view of girls will change from practicing sports in a more professional way and more freely in front of people			0
" the @entity17 is hopeful that the @entity48 will be the first to feature female athletes on every team			0
three teams have never sent women			0
@entity8 have competed in the @entity3 under their flag since 1996 , sending their first female athlete in 2000			1
however , @entity1 believes the fact that she was only told six months ago that she would be going to @entity39 is a sign of how lightly women 's sport is taken in the @entity8 territories			1
she had her first taste of top - level international competition earlier this year at the world indoor championships in @entity62			2
she clocked two minutes 51.87 seconds in her heat for a personal best that was still more than 53 seconds slower than the gold medal - winning time			0
given her lack of preparation and the scant training resources available in her homeland , @entity1 knows a medal is beyond her , so her target is to further improve her personal best			2
" miracles do happen , and with @entity75 's help i will hopefully get a good result , " she said			0
" since they selected me for the @entity3 , my running time has gone from four minutes to just under three , so i 've seen a big improvement			2
" training on pot - holed roads in @entity82 , dodging cars and horses and carts , @entity80 knows that only so much improvement is possible			1
like @entity1 , the 400 - meter runner must rely on an invitation from the @entity17 to compete in @entity39 because neither has reached the required qualifying standard			1
when he is n't running , @entity80 works out in a dingy public gym with shabby white concrete walls			1
" i need a proper track to train on , " he said			1
" at the moment i just run on the roads or on sand			0
also , proper starting blocks are unavailable in @entity82			1
" so when he arrives in @entity39 , he 'll not only have the daunting prospect of a first @entity99 to consider but he 'll also have to quickly get accustomed to unfamiliar conditions			0
" hopefully , the lack of training tools wo n't affect me , and i can prove to the world that we can compete even without them , " he said			0
for @entity80 , competing in @entity39 wo n't leave him completely fulfilled			2
he hopes it is only the start of a long athletics career			0
" my dream is to become a world - known runner and compete with world champions in overseas competitions and hopefully i can achieve my dream in the near future , " he said			2
" my dream is to do something for @entity23 and show the world that @entity23 deserves to live and stand on the podium			0

four @entity8 athletes will compete at the @entity3
@entity1 , 20 , will take part in the women 's 800 meters event
@entity80 , a 21 - year - old from @entity82 , will run in the men 's 400 meters
@entity128 has no proper track to train on , and works out in a public gym
