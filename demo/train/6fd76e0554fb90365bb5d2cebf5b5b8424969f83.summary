-- a @entity2 student commits suicide after being emotionally violated when his sexual encounter with another man is secretly streamed online			2
@entity6 jumps in the @entity7 , and there is a general outcry accompanied by a superficial soul searching			2
why is this happening ? where did this come from ? really ? seriously ? is n't it rather obvious that this cruel prank is but a reflection of a much larger social cancer ? just turn on the tv or check out a newspaper headline			1
" @entity21 " screamed monday 's @entity20			2
it was quoting @entity23 , a mainstream @entity24 candidate for governor of @entity26 who said homosexuality is not an " equally valid " option and attacking his opponent for marching in a gay pride parade			1
a few articles in , another headline reads " @entity33 " about @entity34 who threw @entity37 cocktails and stun grenades to disrupt a gay pride parade in @entity40			1
i look up from the newspaper to see my tv broadcasting a perp walk of teenage men from the @entity46 accused in a gay - bashing rampage			1
cops say during the hate crime , two men suspected of being gay were sodomized with a wooden stick			1
all of this came on the heels of a homophobic attack , allegedly by two @entity57 men , in the restroom of the famed @entity59 in the @entity60 of @entity61			2
that 's the very spot where the gay rights movement was born after a so - called " morals raid " by cops back in 1969 inspired gays to take to the streets in outrage			1
i have been to the @entity59 several times , and this attack gave me chills			0
it 's easy to point in horror at these over-the - top expressions of hate			1
it 's a lot harder to take an honest inventory of troubling attitudes toward gays , which some @entity81 reveal in more subtle ways such as the ubiquitous putdown " that 's so gay ! " i click on my @entity85 , and a friend writes about her fears of revealing her sexual orientation while on a job interview			1
she writes , " i paused right before i said the word ' gay			1
' yes , i was scared			0
i want this job badly , i do			0
i said to myself , though , if they are n't going to accept me for my truth , then it is n't for me			0
i said the word gay and felt good about it			2
" i do n't know whether she got the job			0
but her fear is real , and sadly it is justified			0
i 'm shocked at what 's happening lately because i came out as gay late in life -- just a few years ago -- at a time when it seemed there was much more acceptance			2
i encountered no discrimination from any quarters as a result and was thrilled and filled with hope that human beings might actually be evolving to the point where they can apply that wonderful notion of " do n't tread on me " to sexual orientation			2
clearly this new wave of violence comes partly because equality for gays is a subject that 's dominating the news			1
" @entity123 , " gay marriage : these issues have put the situation in everyone 's face and , therefore , biases that might have been uttered only behind closed doors are now surfacing with a vengeance			1
@entity23 used anti-gay remarks for politics the backlash may also be in response to the enormous strides the @entity138 community has made in recent years			1
the success of @entity140 , who came out more than 10 years ago and remains very popular , is one example			0
it 's inspired a growing number of @entity81 to come out of the closet , too			0
today , it seems almost everyone knows a friend or relative who is gay			2
our former vice president , @entity149 , whose daughter is a lesbian			0
that has caused a lot of @entity81 to open their minds and hearts			0
but , for others , it 's turned a hypothetical antagonism into something very personal and visceral			0
the philosopher @entity160 said every great movement must experience three stages : ridicule , discussion , adoption			0
i would make that last one : acceptance			0
clearly we are in the anger stage of the social justice movement for gays			1
i ca n't wait for us to move past it			0
to that end , i would urge everyone upset over @entity176 's suicide or any of the recent violent attacks to ask themselves : do my attitudes also need an adjustment on this issue ? do i look askance if i see two people of the same sex holding hands ? would i feel uncomfortable if my child 's teacher was gay ? would i be annoyed if my child 's college roommate was gay ? would i be less likely to hire a person who is openly gay ? do i make jokes about people being gay ? have i talked to my child about the perils of intolerance ? why did @entity6 die ? if you 've detected prejudice on your part after this self - analysis , you can do something about it			1
you can acknowledge it and perhaps realize that it 's irrational			0
for example , the states that have approved gay marriage have not seen a social breakdown or any negative repercussions			1
just because something makes one uncomfortable because it 's different does n't mean it 's morally wrong			0
we can all learn to coexist			0
it 's not those with extreme views , but rather those in the middle who will ultimately decide whether @entity81 's gays get to become first - class citizens or whether we will continue to be sidelined by prejudice			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			1

@entity224 says recent anti-gay violence and remarks point up surge in homophobia
but , she says , the " social cancer " of such views is revealed in subtle ways , too
gay issues are in the news ; people are forced to face their biases . it can get ugly , she says
writer : backlash a stage toward social justice ; we should ensure we *'re* not *complicit* in hate
