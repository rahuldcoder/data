" we have been advised that @entity6 authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of @entity8 in connection with the murder of his wife , @entity21 , " defense lawyer @entity14 said monday			1

a spokeswoman for the resort directed @entity2 to a @entity6 news report that quoted the prosecutor saying there was no connection between other deaths and the @entity141 - @entity51 case			1

a @entity0 judge decided friday that the children , ages 3 and 5 , could not attend a memorial service organized sunday by @entity52 - @entity51 's sisters because a therapist said it might be emotionally harmful to them			1
