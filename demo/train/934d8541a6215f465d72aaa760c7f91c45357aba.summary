-- tennis star @entity1 is used to serving on a daily basis -- but he 's taken it in a whole new direction with his latest venture			1
the two - time grand slam winner has launched a five - star hotel just minutes from where he grew up in @entity9 , @entity10			1
set close to where @entity1 learned his trade on the local courts , the 15 - bedroom @entity14 -- set in 34 - acres of lush @entity10 countryside -- is his new venture			1
and while he may not be bringing you the wine list or be on hand to suggest the best local whisky , @entity1 is involved on a regular basis in making sure it all runs smoothly			2
the seed of interest in the hotel was planted in @entity1 's mind after his older brother @entity28 married his @entity30 wife @entity29 at the @entity14 in 2010			1
" it was n't something i 'd thought about but i came here for my brother 's wedding and about six months to a year later we were told that the hotel was going out of business , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity31			1
" the property was for sale and it 's five minutes from my house -- i thought it would be a nice thing to do			0
" under @entity1 's stewardship the hotel has undergone a rapid transformation , with the old @entity48 mansion restored in fine style			1
but a visit to the hotel does n't come cheap -- a stay in one of the suites during the @entity10 summer will cost around $ 1,000 a night , while a small double room will set you back $ 425 a night			1
@entity1 is not the only tennis player to have invested in the hotel industry			1
@entity62 's former world @entity60 @entity63 bought a 19th - century country house in the @entity66 mountains south of @entity67 and turned it into a delightful 12 - suite hotel in 2007			2
compatriot @entity69 has also reportedly invested $ 13.17 million into two hotels he bought in @entity71 , @entity72			0
but for @entity1 , @entity14 's importance is that it 's rooted in the history and community of @entity9 -- a small town proud of his tennis exploits			1
" it 's nice that a lot of the time when i do come back to the various tennis courts and centers they have around here , that the courts are busy and a lot more kids playing tennis			1
i 'm happy about that , " the 27 - year - old says			0
" it 's nice because when we were growing up , the tennis courts around this area never got used , they were empty all of the time			1
" in some ways for us it was good because there was always tennis courts for us , but it seemed like a shame they were empty most of the year			1
" when he steps off the global tennis tour for the final time , @entity9 is also a place he wants to experience more of			0
" i hope to spend a lot more time here when i finish playing because i do n't get the chance to come to @entity10 just now , " he adds			2
" this will definitely make me want to come up to @entity10 a lot more and spend time with my family and be around the hotel			1
" i 'm not sure exactly what my exact role or involvement will be when i am done but i hope it 's still going well at that stage			0
" @entity1 's long - term partner @entity122 has also played a key role in defining the decor of the hotel			1
the pair chose the names of the rooms -- they went for famous @entity10 such as the inventor of penicillin @entity130 , actor @entity132 and former @entity134 manager @entity133			2
" it was hard to choose the names , " confesses @entity1			2
" you do n't want to leave anybody out but i thought it would be a nice fun thing to do and luckily i 've got to meet some of the people that the suites are named after			0
they are great @entity10 people			2
" i might invite them to stay if i bump into them -- but they are pretty busy people			0
" if they do make the trip to the hotel , there is plenty to keep them entertained			0
@entity1 has installed tennis courts which are resplendent in the purple and green colors of @entity155 -- where he will begin the defense of his title next week			1
the property has its own loch , which is stocked full of trout for keen fishermen , while there is also the opportunity to take part in some falconry			0
for now , though , @entity1 must put all thoughts of silver service to the back of his mind as he returns to the grass courts of @entity172 's @entity171 , where he also won the @entity173 in 2012			2
last year he claimed the @entity155 crown with a straight sets win over @entity176 -- becoming the first @entity178 man to secure a victory on home soil in 77 years			0
until last week , @entity1 had won 19 consecutive matches on grass before suffering a shock defeat at @entity184 by 35 - year - old @entity186 @entity185			0
that loss came just days after he appointed former @entity155 women 's champion @entity188 as his new coach			0
@entity192 's ex-world no. 1 will be in his box alongside his mother @entity194 when @entity1 opens the grand slam for the very first time			0
" it will be special , " he says			0
" it 's something a lot of past champions have spoken about -- going back as the winners of the men 's title the previous year			0
" they open the @entity205 on the monday so i 'm sure there will be a lot of pressure and a lot of nerves -- but i 'm looking forward to it			0

@entity1 set to defend his @entity155 title
@entity1 has bought and *renovated* @entity10 hotel
comes with its own @entity218 and tennis courts
