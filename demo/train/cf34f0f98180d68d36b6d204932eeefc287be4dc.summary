-- the world is focused on forging a durable agreement to prevent @entity3 from developing a single nuclear weapon			1
while critically important , these efforts ignore a far greater danger : the thousands of weapons that already exist			0
there are today more than 17,000 nuclear warheads , an ongoing existential threat to human survival that has largely been ignored since the @entity12 ended two decades ago			1
and , unlike @entity3 , there are no comparable negotiations under way to deal with these far more dangerous arsenals			2
in fact , the humanitarian consequences of even a limited nuclear war , such as a conflict in @entity20 between @entity21 and @entity22 , involving just 100 @entity24 - size bombs -- less than 0.5 % of the world 's nuclear arsenal -- would put 2 billion people 's lives and well - being at risk			1
the local effects would be devastating			0
more than 20 million people would be dead in a week from the explosions , firestorms and immediate radiation effects			0
but the global consequences would be far worse			0
the firestorms caused by this war would loft 5 million tons of soot high into the atmosphere , blocking out sunlight and dropping temperatures across the planet			0
this climate disruption would cause a sharp , worldwide decline in food production			1
there would be a 12 % decline in @entity50 corn production and a 15 % decline in @entity53 rice production , both lasting for a full decade			0
a staggering 31 % decline in @entity53 winter wheat production would also last for 10 years			0
the resulting global famine would put at risk 870 million people in the developing world who are already malnourished today , and 300 million people living in countries dependent on food imports			1
in addition , the huge shortfalls in @entity53 food production would threaten another 1.3 billion people within @entity53			2
at the very least there would be a decade of social and economic chaos in the largest country in the world , home to the world 's second largest and most dynamic economy and a large nuclear arsenal of its own			2
a nuclear war of comparable size anywhere in the world would produce the same global impact			1
by way of comparison , each @entity50 @entity79 submarine commonly carries 96 warheads , each of which is 10 to 30 times more powerful than the weapons used in the @entity20 scenario			2
that means a single submarine can cause the devastation of a nuclear famine many times over			2
the @entity50 has 14 of these submarines , plus land - based missiles and a fleet of strategic bombers			0
the @entity96 arsenal has the same incredible overkill capacity			0
two decades after the @entity12 , nuclear weapons are ill - suited to meet modern threats and cost hundreds of billions of dollars to maintain			1
there is a growing global movement to prevent such a catastrophe			2
in 2011 , the @entity105 and @entity104 called for its national societies to educate the public about these humanitarian consequences and called for the abolition of nuclear weapons			1
seventeen nations issued a joint statement in may 2012 on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons that called for their total elimination			1
by this fall the number rose to 125 nations			0
the international community should continue to take practical steps to prevent additional countries from acquiring nuclear weapons			1
but this effort to prevent proliferation must be matched by real progress to eliminate the far greater danger posed by the vast arsenals that already exist			0
simply put , the only way to eliminate the threat of nuclear war or risk of an accidental launch or mishap is to eliminate nuclear weapons			1
this past year the majority of the world 's nations attended a two - day conference in @entity139 , @entity140 , on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear war			1
the @entity50 and the other major nuclear powers would not attend this meeting			0
there will be an important follow - up meeting in @entity147 in february			0
@entity50 should lead nuclear weapons states in attending and embrace the call to eliminate nuclear weapons			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			0

@entity153 : @entity155 has been on stopping @entity3 nukes , but world has 17,000 - plus warheads
he says even limited nuclear war with existing warheads could put 2 billion lives at risk
he says ensuing devastation would cause sharp decline in food and global famine
@entity153 : how to prevent even accidental launch ? eliminate all nuclear weapons
