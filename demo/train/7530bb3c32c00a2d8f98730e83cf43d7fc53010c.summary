@entity0 , @entity1 -- imagine being a ceo of ideas , heading up a process in which you generate , process and test out new ideas -- for a living			1
welcome to a day in the life of @entity10 , ceo of innovations at one of the biggest media houses in @entity14 , @entity16 / @entity15 her mandate is to generate 250 new ideas annually , out of which 50 have to settle into a new activity -- and income stream -- for the company			1
it sounds ambitious , because it is			2
" it takes a real shift in a company 's traditional way of thinking , to open itself to an innovations department			1
it has to move out of the usual way of working in silos , and be able to work all the way across			2
" @entity10 is likely the right person for the job			1
she is not your usual business leader , and there is no doubt this 50 - year - old high school graduate , is doing things her own way			1
" i know where i am going , that 's about it , " says @entity10 , who does n't like to operate by rules , and runs her business by what she calls the cigar box principle			1
" i am quite practical and simple in my approach			2
if i take out one krone , i know i need to put back two			1
" do n't let her simple approach fool you			2
making it to the top of a media conglomerate takes something more , which she says comes in part from her wide background of experience			0
a single mother with virtually no education , @entity10 worked as a record sorter , radio host , casting assistant , advertising representative , tv producer , and much more -- before founding her own production company , hosting her own tv show , launching her own magazine , and authoring several books			1

after a successful stint as chief editor , @entity10 was asked to run about 20 of @entity84 's magazines , and last year they asked her to head up a new innovations department			1
" i do have a very different approach to things , " she says			0
" i work differently than they do , and i question everything			0
" she has had to learn a few things along the way			0
among other things , her male colleagues taught her how to leave her emotions behind , when entering a decision - making process			0
" as women we have a tendency to make things personal			0
we are more holistic , which can be a great strength but it can also be very limiting			0
as a leader you have to be able to say , this will hurt , but we need to get it over with			0
" @entity10 says she has never really taken on anything she knew how to do			1
but , that she always knew how to align herself with the best			0
" when i started a new magazine and a tv show , i had no idea how to do it			2
but i knew how to find the best people to help me			0
for leaders today , it is not enough just to know how to be the ceo of a bank			2
you have to be able to do so much more			0
and that is not possible for any one person			0
so , i hire only the best			0
people who know more than i do			0

@entity10 says change is happening and so must we			1
" technology has outpaced tradition			0
media habits are changing radically			0
so , we must think differently			0
and for us , it is really about putting old content into new bottles , " she says			0
the process works with her team generating ideas from inside and out , filtering them , exploring their potential , refining them , creating a business case for them , and moving forward with worthwhile ventures for the company			1
it sounds like a creative process , but to @entity10 , it is more than that			1
" innovation is defined as new ways of thinking that generate growth			2
it is the idea that gets put into action			1
anyone can be creative , but creativity does n't necessarily lead to growth , " she says			2

" as a 140 year old company , we do not need to be thinking out of the box			2
we need to be thinking at the edge of the box , " she says			0
perhaps not unlike herself , as she continues to move down new and innovative pathways			0
alongside her job as head of innovations , this seemingly unstoppable entrepreneur has just launched a new online talk show , is writing books , and working on various tv shows			1
" i think i have been blessed with a good mix of creativity , strategy , and a sense of business , " she says .			1
