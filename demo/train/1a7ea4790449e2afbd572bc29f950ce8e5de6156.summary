@entity0 -- for more than 200 years , it lay hidden beneath the ground upon which @entity0 's @entity4 once stood			1
now , four years after its discovery , scientists say they 've solved the mystery of the ship hull found in the wreckage of the former @entity11 in lower @entity12			1
the hull , originally found by archeologists monitoring the site 's excavation , has been traced back to colonial - era @entity17 , according to researchers at the @entity19 at the @entity20 of @entity21			1
" an old growth forest in the @entity17 area supplied the white oak used in the ship 's frame and ... the trees were probably cut in 1773 or so -- a few years before the bloody war that established @entity30 's independence from @entity31 , " according to a statement from the scientists			1
researchers used a process known as " dendroprovenancing " to determine the hull 's origins , whereby tree rings from wood samples were analyzed and referenced against several other historical tree chronologies			1
" trees respond to climate each year and that pattern of rings created within the tree produces a signature for that species in a forest or region , " said @entity42 , a research scientist on the study			1
" we took oak samples from the @entity4 vessel and made a record of growth through time			1
we then compared it to independent records of white oak that we had			2
" researchers looked at oak chronologies from @entity63 through @entity64 , but their analysis found that the samples had the greatest compatibility with trees in eastern @entity69 , particularly in the @entity17 area dating in the latter part of the 18th century			1
scientists also found that the same kind of oak trees used to build the ship were also likely used to build @entity17 's @entity77 , where the @entity78 was signed in 1776 , the study said			1
the ship was found approximately 6.7 meters , or nearly 22 feet below ground , just south of where the @entity4 towers stood before they were toppled in the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			1
it was not detected during earlier construction			0
" it 's such an intense site already based on its recent history , so to be in the midst of this urban , modern , very fraught location , and then to be sitting on what was a river bottom , with clams and fish , and the smell of low tide , was really an amazing juxtaposition , " said @entity86 , an archeologist with the environmental consulting firm @entity87 , who was among those who discovered the ship 's hull in the wreckage in 2010			1
archeologists typically perform basic research to determine whether a construction site could be sensitive for archeological reasons , said @entity86			2
she and her colleagues had been at ground zero to monitor construction for any potential finds			2
" early one morning , we were monitoring and suddenly saw this curved timber come up , " she recalled			0
" it was clear to me that it was part of a ship , so we stopped the backhoes and starting hand digging			0
" the ship has been tentatively identified as a @entity120 sloop , which researchers say was designed by the @entity122 to carry passengers and cargo over the river 's rocky shallows			2
after being in use for 20 to 30 years , the ship is believed to have sailed to lower @entity12 , where it was eventually sunk , either deliberately or by accident , and ultimately buried by trash and other fill materials purposely used to extend @entity12 's shoreline			2
" abundant fill materials such as rocks , earth , and refuse were placed behind wooden barriers or within wood structures to create new land			0
earlier wharfs and abandoned merchant ships were often a component of the fill in newly constructed land , " according to the study			0
the majority of the ship remains are currently being stored at @entity149 , said @entity150 , spokesman for @entity151			0
the @entity152 , created in the aftermath of 9/11 to help plan the rebuilding of @entity12 , is a subsidiary of @entity151 , owns the ship			0
" we 're working on potential options for the future which could potentially include preservation of the ship , but right now , set plans are still being determined , " @entity150 said			0
for @entity42 and fellow researchers , the ship 's discovery and the investigation that followed has provided data that may prove useful for further research			1
" the beauty of dendrochronology is that we can actually use those same samples to understand past climate change and the ecology of forests			0
the response to our work has been really big , bigger than we expected , " @entity42 said			0
" for us , we have this really rich data set from the @entity4 ship that we can use for future work			2
in a way , the ship lives on			0
" a u-boat and its @entity30 prey haunt @entity183 explorer : underwater pirates looted what he says is likely @entity188 after 125 years , ship rediscovered at bottom of @entity191			0

scientists say hull found at the @entity4 site likely originated from a forest in the @entity17 area
vessel likely built around 1773 and believed to have been a " @entity201 " ship
scientists analyzed and compared tree - rings on wood from the ship with wood samples to determine probable age
ship 's hull was found by archeologists at ground zero site in july 2010
