@entity0 the death penalty trial of accused @entity4 bomber @entity3 -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection , crippling snowstorms and last - ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week			1
judge @entity11 , along with the prosecution and defense teams , settled on a pool of 70 jury prospects on wednesday after questioning 256 people over 21 days of individual interviews			1
the attorneys will weed out jurors they believe are less sympathetic to their case on tuesday , march 3			1
these " preemptory challenges " let attorneys remove jury prospects without giving a reason			1
each side gets 20 challenges for the main jury and three for the alternates			2
the following morning , the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to be formally seated to hear opening statements and the first witnesses to an event that cut @entity0 to its core			1
@entity11 indicated the trial could last well into june			0
the jurors first will decide whether @entity3 is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event			1
if convicted , the jury then will decide whether he should be punished by life in prison without the possibility of release or death , most likely by lethal injection			0
potential jurors were questioned at length about whether they already believed @entity3 was guilty and whether they could consider the death penalty in a state where it has n't been an option in a generation			1
the last execution here took place in 1947			0
many said they thought @entity3 was guilty of the april 15 , 2013 , bombings , which killed three people near the finish line			2
@entity3 also is charged in the april 19 , 2013 , death of @entity66 police officer @entity65			2
the officer was ambushed in his patrol car and shot to death as @entity3 and his brother @entity70 ran from police hours after their photographs were released to the public			2
the defense , claiming it could n't find an impartial jury in @entity0 , tried three times to persuade @entity11 to move the trial			1
an appeal is pending before the 1st @entity81 @entity80 , which has not ruled			0
opening statements and the first witnesses originally were slated for january 26 , but it took longer that anticipated to question the prospective jurors for this high - profile case			1
the panel of 70 was selected from the first 600 or so jurors of the 1,373 who filled out questionnaires earlier this year			2
many of the jury prospects struggled with questions about where they stood on the death penalty and whether they could follow the law and vote for capital punishment if the facts and the law led them to that decision			0
@entity103 wiped the death penalty from its books for good in 1984			0
but this case is being tried in federal court , and 17 of the 30 counts against @entity3 include the death penalty as a possible punishment			2
also cited are so - called aggravating factors such as committing an act of terror and the tender years of the youngest victim , 8 - year - old @entity114			0
it is almost certain that the trial , which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims , will be well underway during the running of this year 's @entity4 on april 20			1
@entity3 , 21 , is accused of building two homemade pressure cooker bombs with his older brother , @entity70			1
the bombs detonated within moments of each other near the finish line			0
beside the three deaths , more than 250 other people were maimed or injured by flying shrapnel and nails			0
@entity131 died during a gun battle with police , and @entity3 was found hours later , bleeding and hiding in a boat in a @entity136 backyard			2
he had written @entity139 slogans on the sides of the boat , federal authorities allege			0
no cameras are allowed at the @entity3 trial			1
but @entity1 's @entity144 will be there every day			0
think of her as the 13th juror , bringing insights here weekly			0
and follow @ @entity148 on @entity149 daily .			0
