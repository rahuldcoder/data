@entity0 , @entity1 -- negative , expensive campaigns is something sen. @entity5 is getting an education in this year			1
and something @entity7 knows very well			2
@entity9 campaigned saturday for her fellow @entity10 at a @entity0 rally of about 1,800 supporter			1
the former @entity14 senator and secretary of state -- and widely presumed 2016 presidential contender -- used her appearance for @entity5 to decry @entity18 , the @entity19 looking to unseat @entity5 in november , as someone who will answer to big business , not raise the minimum wage and slash education funding			1
and unlike other appearances @entity9 has made on the midterm campaign trail , the former first lady spent a portion of her speech saturday decrying the level of outside spending in the @entity32 race			2
" elections come down often to who has got more money , who is pedaling more fear and who turns out , " @entity9 told an excited crowd			1
the former first lady later criticized the " onslaught of out of state money and negativity that is coming in against " @entity5			1
" you have to prove them wrong , " @entity9 urged the crowd			1
prove to them " that no matter how much money has flooded into this state , @entity1 is not for sale " -- the latter phrase having a mantra for @entity5 supporters			1
there is a reason @entity9 focused on this : the @entity57 race is by far the most expensive in the country this year			1
so far , campaigns and outside groups have spent close to $ 80 million in the state			2
according to the @entity62 , @entity18 has had $ 44 million of outside money spent on his behalf			0
@entity5 has had $ 22 million			2
@entity18 is backed by groups like @entity66 , @entity67 and the @entity68			0
@entity5 has been supported by @entity69 , the @entity70 and @entity71 , a labor organization			0
the onslaught of spending likely wo n't stop soon , either			0
a spokesman for @entity5 said he sees the total spent in the campaign jumping to over $ 100 million in the last 10 days of campaign			0
what key @entity57 race means for 2016 this level of spending is something @entity9 understands personally : according to the @entity62 , @entity9 's @entity82 race in 2000 , which cost over $ 100 million , is the most expensive race ever ( in 2014 dollar terms )			1
@entity9 did her part on saturday to make sure that @entity5 had enough money in the final days of the campaign			1
before her speech -- which was free for those who attended -- the former first lady took part in a fundraising reception and photo line for the @entity5 campaign			0
organizers would not say how much that event raised , but pointed out that it was also used as a reward for active volunteers			0
@entity5 , too , belied the amount of outside spending in the race , even though she is benefiting from some			2
she criticized " out - of - state billionaires " who are " trying to buy this election			1
" " i want you to help send a message loud and clear to my opponent and his special interest allies , " @entity5 said			0
" i want it to be so loud that the @entity113 and @entity114 , wherever they are , because we know they are n't in @entity1 , we want to tell them that @entity1 is not for sale			0
" what the outside spending has meant is near constant negative ads on televisions across the state			0
at a focus group of ten @entity1 moms earlier this week , the negative ads were one of many reasons that the women said they were tuning out the @entity32 race			2
" all i get from all of those is do n't vote for that person , because they are a bad person , vote for me , " said one woman			0
" everything we are teaching your kids is ridiculous , " said another , reflecting on the ads. " we teach our kids not to bully and that is all they are doing			0
