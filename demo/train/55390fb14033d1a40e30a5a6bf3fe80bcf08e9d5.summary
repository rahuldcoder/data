@entity0 -- a @entity3 admiral engaged in sexual relations in the @entity5 in 1990 with a federal employee whom he falsely told he was a widower , according to a report released friday by the @entity8			1
rear adm. @entity9 was demoted and fired from his post as director of the @entity3 staff			1
in march , when the report was submitted to @entity8 officials , rear adm. @entity9 was demoted and fired from his post as director of the @entity3 staff			1
@entity9 told investigators he could n't remember the name of the woman he had an affair with			1
he also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman , identified as " @entity22 , " the @entity8 's inspector general 's report said			1
@entity22 , who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency , told the investigators the allegations were true , the report said			1
her supervisor and @entity31 's superiors supported her testimony			2
@entity9 was convicted april 18 of making false official statements to investigators			1
after the hearing , called an admiral 's mast , he requested retirement			0
@entity22 told investigators that she and @entity31 began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989 , that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times , including once in a @entity5 room reserved for " military aides with overnight duties			1
" she also told investigators that @entity31 came to her home on the day in august 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him " scum , " shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again			1
read the report ( @entity56 ) " we found ms. @entity22 to be an extremely credible , candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband , " the report said			0
by contrast , the report said , @entity31 's testimony was " inconsistent with the weight of the evidence , " and " it did not appear @entity31 's misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent			2
" at issue was @entity31 's removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990			2
@entity9 testified that he initiated the request to leave his @entity5 post because of " close family personal problems			2
" but his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman -- and that he admitted the affair			2
@entity22 's supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from @entity22 , she confirmed @entity31 's marital status and told @entity88 what she 'd learned			1
" ms. @entity22 's reaction , according to the supervisor , was one of complete surprise and shock , " the report said			0
the supervisor also said that she telephoned @entity31 's immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up , the supervisor told her that " everybody in town knew @entity102 was f'ing some bimbo at the [ federal agency ]			1
" @entity31 , however , denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with @entity22 , although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an " inappropriate relationship " with her because he told her about his marital problems			1
" i did not have sex with this woman , " he said during one of two interviews with investigators			0
although he told investigators he could not remember the woman 's name , he testified that he " had to live with shame for a long time " after the " inappropriate relationship " ended , that he was " racked with guilt " and " had a terrible time getting myself right with my family			1
" " so i have had a great 18 - year career since i left the @entity5 , " he said , according to the report			0
" if this is the end of it , then i still leave a rewarded individual , thankful for the blessings that i have had			0
" investigators found @entity31 's remarks inconsistent			2
" in our view , comments regarding guilt , shame , and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss , " they wrote in the report			0
this year , according to the report , the inspector general 's office provided @entity143 with its preliminary findings : that he 'd provided " false and misleading testimony " regarding the nature of his relationship with @entity22 , his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower			0
@entity31 responded with a vehement denial			2
" [ @entity154 ] find it extremely regrettable , in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career , that you have chosen to question my integrity , " he wrote in a february 15 letter			0
" the unfortunate truth in this case is that , as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations , you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as i defended myself against these allegations			0
" @entity31 further castigated the investigators because , at that time , they had chosen not to interview @entity22 " in deference to ms. @entity22 's privacy , " according to the report			1
@entity22 " readily agreed " to testify when they contacted her after @entity31 's rebuttal			0
" ms. @entity22 confirmed that she and @entity9 had an extensive physical relationship which began on an overseas trip and lasted intermittently for approximately eight months , " the investigators wrote			2
" the relationship included sexual intercourse on approximately one dozen occasions , to include intercourse during overseas travel , in the @entity5 and in her home			0
" @entity22 also said @entity9 told her that his wife had died of breast cancer , that a woman who answered the phone when she called his home was the children 's nanny and that he continued to wear his wedding ring " for his daughters who missed their late mother			1
" according to the report , the investigation began when investigators received an anonymous letter containing " significant " details about the affair			1
investigators had received another such letter in 1999 , but it contained no detail and was not investigated			2
@entity31 became well known in the initial months of the war in @entity205 , when he often conducted on - camera television briefings as a @entity8 spokesman			0
