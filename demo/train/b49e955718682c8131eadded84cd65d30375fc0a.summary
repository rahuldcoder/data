-- while we officially celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of @entity6 's " on the @entity8 " on november 24 , celebrations of @entity6 's legacy have actually been building in intensity for several years			1
@entity6 is not just an important 19th century scientific thinker			1
increasingly , he is a cultural icon			0
@entity6 is the subject of adulation that teeters on the edge of hero worship , expressed in everything from scholarly seminars and lecture series to best - selling new atheist tracts like those by @entity20 and @entity21			2
the atheists claim that @entity6 disproved once and for all the argument for intelligent design from nature			1
and that of course is why he remains hugely controversial			0
a @entity29 poll commissioned by the @entity30 this year found that 52 percent of @entity31 agree " the development of life was guided by intelligent design			1
" those who are not scientists may wonder if they have a right to entertain skepticism about darwinian theory			0
read a leading @entity6 proponent 's view that evolution leaves no room for intelligent design theory we are told that a consensus of scientists supporting the theory means that darwinian evolution is no longer subject to debate			1
but does it ever happen that a seemingly broad consensus of scientific expertise turns out to be wrong , generated by an ideologically motivated stampeding of opinion ? of course , that does happen			2
many ideologically driven crusades in science -- the earth - centered solar system and eugenics , for example -- survived long after supposed evidence for these ideas evaporated			0
and precisely the same thing is happening today in the ideologically charged field of evolutionary biology			0
indeed , there are strong scientific reasons to doubt the consensus about @entity6 's theory and what it allegedly proved			1
contrary to @entity75 orthodoxy , the fossil record actually challenges the idea that all organisms have evolved from a single common ancestor			1
why ? fossil studies reveal " a biological big bang " near the beginning of the @entity82 ( 520 million years ago ) when many major , separate groups of organisms or " phyla " ( including most animal body plans ) emerged suddenly without clear precursors			2
@entity88 finds repeatedly have confirmed a pattern of explosive appearance and prolonged stability in living forms , not the gradual " branching - tree " pattern implied by @entity6 's common ancestry thesis			1
there are also reasons to doubt the creative power of @entity6 's mechanism of natural selection			1
while many scientists accept that natural selection can produce small - scale " micro-evolutionary " variations , many biologists now doubt that natural selection and random mutations can generate the large - scale changes necessary to produce fundamentally new structures and forms of life			0
for this reason more than 800 scientists , including professors from institutions such as @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity115 universities and members of various national ( @entity31 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 ) academies of science have signed a statement questioning the creative power of the selection / mutation mechanism			0
increasingly , there are reasons to doubt the @entity75 idea that living things merely " appear " to be designed			1
instead , living systems display telltale signs of actual or " intelligent " design such as the presence of complex circuits , miniature motors and digital information in living cells			2
consider the implications , for example , of one of modern biology 's most important discoveries			0
in 1953 when @entity144 and @entity145 elucidated the structure of the @entity148 molecule , they made a startling discovery			0
the structure of @entity148 allows it to store information in the form of a four - character digital code , similar to a computer code			0
this discovery highlights a scientific mystery that @entity6 never addressed : how did the first life on earth arise ? to date no theory of undirected chemical evolution has explained the origin of the information needed to build the first living cell			1
instead , the digital code and information processing systems that run the show in living cells point decisively toward prior intelligent design			1
indeed , we know from our repeated experience -- the basis of all scientific reasoning -- that systems possessing these features always arise from an intelligent source -- from minds , not material processes			2
@entity6 's " revolutionary " legacy on display @entity148 functions like a software program			1
we know that software comes from programmers			0
information -- whether inscribed in hieroglyphics , written in a book , or encoded in a radio signal -- always arises from a designing intelligence			0
so the discovery of digital code in @entity148 provides a strong scientific reason for concluding that the information in @entity148 also had an intelligent source			2
despite the consensus view that @entity6 showed that " design could arise without a designer " there is now compelling scientific evidence of actual intelligent design in even the simplest living cells			1
the question of biological origins has long raised profound philosophical questions			0
is life the result of purely material processes or did a purposive intelligence play a role ? it 's not surprising that such a worldview - shaping issue would illicit strong passions and disagreements			0
all the more reason to let the evidence , rather than a supposed consensus , determine the outcome of what is , in fact , a very legitimate and important debate about the @entity75 legacy			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			0

@entity221 says there are scientific reasons to doubt consensus about @entity6 's theory
@entity221 : fossil record challenges idea that organisms evolved from a single ancestor
@entity221 : there is compelling scientific evidence of actual intelligent design
