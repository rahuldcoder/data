-- the scene is set for a thrilling climax to the 2012 @entity4 season after @entity5 upstaged title contenders @entity6 and @entity8 by claiming pole position for sunday 's @entity11 @entity10			1
@entity5 , who beat the duo to win the penultimate race in the @entity14 last weekend , headed off @entity16 teammate @entity15 in saturday 's qualifying at @entity18			1
championship leader @entity6 had to settle for fourth on the grid behind @entity21 teammate @entity20 , while second - placed @entity8 was back in eighth -- later bumped up to seventh -- as he was again out - qualified by @entity23 colleague @entity22			1
@entity8 was handed a small boost when @entity26 ' pastor @entity25 was relegated from sixth to 16th after receiving a reprimand for failing to take his car to the weighbridge when requested to do so by stewards			2
who is @entity4 's greatest driver ? @entity6 will clinch his third successive title if @entity8 -- also seeking to become the sport 's youngest triple champion -- finishes outside the top three			1
the @entity37 , who holds a 13 - point lead after finishing second in @entity40 , will be champion whatever his rival 's result if he places in the top four			0
however , with rain expected on sunday the title race is far from over -- especially as @entity8 has overcome poor qualifying form many times this season to consistently finish on the podium			1
" @entity51 in the @entity14 and eighth here so more or less as i expected , " he said			0
" i will try to achieve the podiums which we achieved in @entity56 and @entity40 from those positions			0
" no big changes in our race			0
@entity4 is dominated by aerodynamics			2
we ran with maximum downforce in dry and same in the wet so no big changes today , no gamble			0
" latest @entity4 standings the @entity67 , who won his two titles with @entity69 in 2005 and 2006 , triumphed in the season 's only rain - affected race in @entity73 in march			1
he was helped in @entity74 when @entity23 gave @entity22 an automatic five - place grid penalty by changing his gearbox , but this time the @entity11 will be looking to impress on his home track -- where he was denied the 2008 world title by @entity5 on the last lap despite winning the race			1
" i will try everything i can , " said @entity22 , who qualified fifth ahead of @entity82 driver @entity25			2
" i do n't know what the weather will be but everyone says it is wet			0
we know @entity18 and that anything can happen			0
the only thing i need to do is concentrate on my own race in front of my own people			2
" @entity6 has recovered from a difficult start to the season , making the most of improvements provided by @entity21 designer @entity98 to win four races in a row before finishing third from a pit - lane start in @entity56 and then second last weekend			1
" it was not quick enough and i know i could have done a little better , " the 25 - year - old said			0
" but let 's wait and see what happens tomorrow			0
" @entity5 claimed his seventh pole this season and is seeking to end his career - long spell at @entity16 with a second successive victory			1
" i am grateful to be able to put the car on the front row and to have had my last qualifying with @entity16 as a one - two , it is a fantastic job by the team , " said the @entity110 after the team locked out the front row for a record 67th time			1
" i think the weather will be tricky tomorrow , it will make it more of a lottery			0
" next season @entity5 will move to @entity123 to replace @entity124 , who will start the final race of his career 13th out of 24 drivers			1
the seven - time world champion , who was fourth at @entity18 before his first retirement in 2006 , missed out on the third and final qualifying session			2
the 43 - year - old was almost two seconds slower than @entity5 's leading time of 1:12.458 , finishing behind the @entity110 's replacement at @entity16 next year -- @entity134 of @entity135			1
" i am not particularly happy about the qualifying session , " @entity124 said			0
" we might have compromised the car too much for the rain which is expected for tomorrow and was also forecast for qualifying			0
" my starting position is now quite tricky , and i will have to see what we can make out of it			0
@entity135 's new signing @entity145 will start sixth in his final race for @entity147 at a track where the @entity37 claimed a surprise pole position in 2010			1
former world champion @entity150 , seeking to hold off @entity5 for third place in the drivers ' standings , will be eighth on the grid ahead of @entity123 ' @entity155 and @entity147 's @entity156			0
@entity157 will start 11th as he seeks to earn a new deal with @entity26 at the circuit where his three - time world champion uncle @entity160 made his name as a @entity11 folk hero .			2
