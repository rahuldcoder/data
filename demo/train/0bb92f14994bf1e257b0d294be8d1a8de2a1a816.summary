-- redemption is not easy to attain			0
four years on and the scars still remain			0
when @entity5 's footballers left for @entity6 , they were under no illusions -- it can not happen again			1
at @entity9 2010 , " @entity5 " became a laughing stock as players and coaches clashed , strikes were threatened and results embarrassed a nation			2
players were suspended , the entire country waged war on a group which had imploded and exited at the group stage after failing to win a single game			0
four years ago the picture was grim			0
fast - forward to the present and perhaps , just perhaps , @entity5 may get the opportunity to shock the world for all the right reasons			1
a 2 - 0 victory over @entity29 in @entity30 on monday ensured its progress to the quarterfinals and a meeting with @entity34 , which beat @entity35 2 - 1 after extra time			1
it is a far cry for the disillusionment and disappointment which cast a shadow of @entity42 football during its last foray into the @entity44			1
" what happened , happened , " coach @entity45 said when he announced his @entity47 roster on national television			0
" that wo n't go away			0
it put a stamp on our history			0
but we do n't need to discuss it again			0
" deschamps and his players have spoken at length of moving on from the embarrassment of four years ago -- but few expected them to achieve much in @entity6			0
after all , this is a @entity5 side which only just scraped into the tournament courtesy of a 3 - 0 playoff victory over @entity65 in @entity66 after suffering a 2 - 0 victory in the first leg			1
but @entity45 , a @entity44 hero on home soil in 1998 , has brought about a unity in the squad which has not been seen for many a year			2
his decision to leave out @entity74 's @entity73 caused controversy outside of the squad -- but it did not surprise those who know @entity45 as the single - minded man that he is			2
he commands respect -- it helps if you 've won the @entity44 and @entity82 as well as a host of titles at club level			2
and his players are responding -- even when not at their best as they were during the first half against @entity29			1
but such is the quality at his disposal , @entity45 never panicked , even when @entity29 appeared to take the game to his side in the opening 45 minutes			2
@entity94 's 79th minute header and an own - goal from @entity96 smoothed @entity5 's passage into the next round following a difficult afternoon			1
" i am very proud of everything we did from the start , " @entity45 told @entity42 television after the game			2
" there was tension out there			0
they are a very strong side and there were a lot of duels			0
" but we 're through			0
we 're in the quarter finals and we 'll do everything we can to go a stage further			0
" only three @entity116 teams have ever reached the quarterfinals of the @entity44 -- @entity118 the last to do so four years ago			1
but @entity29 's campaign has been blighted by inconsistency and rows over appearance fees -- a matter so serious that the country 's president , @entity124 , was forced to intervene and assure players they would be paid			1
form has also been a problem -- a drab goalless draw against @entity130 in its opening game of the tournament was followed by a narrow victory over @entity134			0
a 3 - 2 defeat by @entity136 , in which @entity137 scored twice , ensured @entity29 qualified in second place despite having only managed a solitary win			1
but @entity5 , a side which won its group with a style and swagger which was so sorely lacking four years ago , hinted at a far more difficult challenge			2
after all , @entity29 had managed just one victory in its previous 11 @entity44 matches and suffered defeat on both occasions it had reached the second round in 1994 and 1998			1
but if anyone had expected @entity5 to simply brush @entity29 aside , they were sorely mistaken			1
the @entity29 , who won the @entity154 in 2013 , arrived in @entity30 as underdogs , not that you would have known it during the early stages of the contest			2
while @entity5 appeared slow and sluggish , those in green began in sprightly fashion and thought they had taken the lead after 19 minutes			2
@entity165 , the man who terrorized @entity136 with two fine goals , picked out @entity167 inside the penalty area and the striker turned the ball home			0
unfortunately for @entity29 , @entity167 had strayed just offside -- not by much , but enough for the flag of the assistant referee to be held high and bring a curtailment to the celebrations			2
perhaps that piece of luck awoke @entity5 from its slumber as just moments later a fine move almost broke the deadlock			2
@entity94 , one of the most exciting young midfielders in the game , burst into space before feeding @entity184			2
@entity184 , free of any @entity29 pressure , then produced an inch - perfect cross that @entity94 met with a rasping volley which @entity188 saved in spectacular fashion			1
@entity188 , who plays his club football in @entity5 with @entity191 , kept more clean sheets than any other in @entity194 last season			0
but that save apart , he was a mere spectator in the first half with @entity5 failing to register another shot on target			1
@entity5 , which had lost two of its previous three @entity44 games against @entity116 opposition , might have been expected to emerge a different side after the interval			1
but that fluidity so evident in group - stage victories over @entity207 and @entity208 still proved elusive			0
instead , @entity29 continued to look the more threatening of the two sides -- @entity211 's fierce effort bringing a sharp save out of @entity213 in the @entity42 goal			1
by that time , @entity5 could have and possibly should have been reduced to 10 men following a horrific tackle by @entity217 on @entity218			1
@entity220 referee @entity219 showed a yellow card -- much to the consternation of the @entity223 , who believed the challenge warranted more than just a caution			0
it was only with the introduction of @entity228 in place of the disappointing @entity230 up front that @entity5 began to look dangerous			0
it was griezmann who helped create the chance of the game with 20 minutes remaining			0
the @entity235 forward played a one - two with @entity236 , sending the @entity238 striker in on goal -- but his effort was partially saved by @entity188 and hacked off the goal - line by @entity242			0
suddenly , it was @entity5 which began to take control , with its passing game finally causing @entity29 problems			1
first , @entity236 crashed an effort across goal which had those in green shirts panicking , while @entity252 's spectacular 20 - yard effort smashed across the crossbar with @entity188 beaten			1
but , with 11 minutes to go , @entity5 finally got the breakthrough it had threatened			0
@entity188 came to deal with a corner and when he could only flap at the ball , @entity94 nodded home from close range			0
" there are no words to describe this , " said @entity94 after helping his side past @entity29			1
" i know there is a whole country behind us			0
scoring that goal really liberated us			0
i am so happy for the team and all @entity5			0
" to score a goal for your country , especially in an important match like this to get into the @entity44 quarter finals , it 's one of the best moments of my life			1
" @entity94 's goal -- the 146th of the tournament , one more than was managed at the entire 2010 @entity44 -- set up a frantic finale as @entity29 pushed forward in search of an equalizer			1
but every time those in green swarmed forward , @entity5 moved to exploit the space and only a wonderful save by @entity188 stopped @entity228 from doubling his side 's advantage			1
the second goal appeared inevitable and it duly arrived during stoppage time when @entity96 , making his 100th international appearance , deflected @entity184 's cross into his own net			1
it was a sad end to an afternoon which had begun with such promise for @entity29 -- but for @entity5 , the chance for redemption remains .			1

@entity5 defeats @entity29 2 - 0 in @entity44 last - 16 clash
@entity94 's second - half header gives @entity42 advantage
@entity96 nets an own - goal in stoppage time
@entity5 will play @entity34 in the quarterfinals
