@entity1 , @entity0 -- if riding on top of a @entity5 freight train while bandits lie in wait , or inviting real - life gang members to improvise street battles does n't sound like the wisest approach to making your first feature film , try telling @entity13			1
" @entity20 " portrays one boy 's struggle to escape @entity5 's gang culture set against the backdrop of the trade in illegal immigrants			1
because those are exactly the scrapes the 32 - year - old writer - director got into during production of his highly - acclaimed debut " @entity20			1
" set in @entity5 against the backdrop of the country 's ballooning people trafficking problem , @entity26 's social - political thriller shows one boy 's struggle to escape @entity5 gang culture after meeting a @entity34 immigrant girl			1
the half - @entity37 half - @entity36 director decided that it would be impossible to portray street gang culture or the treacherous immigrant experience without fully immersing himself in both			2
" to tell a story of what it 's like to travel on top of freight trains , or the camaraderie of living in a gang , are all things i could imagine maybe , " @entity13 told @entity2			1
" but i would n't be able to get it right without meeting the people who actually experienced it , and experiencing some of that with them			0
" after @entity13 first conceived " @entity20 " ( which translates as " without a name " ) in 2005 he embarked on a mammoth research tour in order to fully understand what it is like to be both a desperate immigrant and a street gang member			1
he spent two weeks with immigrants at a train yard in @entity64 , @entity5 , before risking his life illegally riding on the roof of a train traveling across the border state of @entity69			1
" people get shot , trains derail , assaults happen , " said @entity13			1
" i had to understand that if i fell off the train and lost a limb , i could just bleed to death out there , there 'd be no - one to come pick me up			0
" the filmmaker , who is an @entity78 citizen , was taken aback by the camaraderie among the immigrants in spite of the danger and violence			0
" some of the bits of humor that would happen on the journey really surprised me , " he told @entity2			0
" you could laugh minutes after someone had been shot			0
" it is this 27 - hour train ride , during which a there was a bandit attack , that forms the basis of a substantial portion of the action in " @entity20			2
" @entity13 also visited members of the notoriously violent @entity97 street gangs in jail in @entity5			1
" i spent about two years in two different prisons , and reduced a group of gang members down to a couple guys i could trust , " he explained			1
@entity13 courted them with with gifts in the hope they would aid his research			2
" after bringing them grilled chickens and enough @entity113 ink and cd components so they could make tattoo guns , they felt like they could trust me enough to hook me up with one of their outside people			0
then they knew i was n't just a cop			0
" the end result is a starkly realistic portrayal of the @entity124 gangs that make their living trafficking people to the @entity78			2
the film 's action includes a dramatic shootout scene featuring real gang members as extras alongside actors			1
" all the guns had blanks , " @entity13 said			2
" i had a gun too , if i had to regulate the situation			0
" not that that made the scene entirely unproblematic : " the guy who plays the leader in that scene is a gang member , " said @entity13			2
" once we shot that scene he was gone			0
i do n't know where he went , and there was no way to track him down to come back in and record audio or anything			0
" nevertheless , @entity13 maintains that the characters he chose to portray are inherently likeable people			0
" i liked the gang members and the immigrants i met equally , and had equal respect for them " @entity13 said			1
" some of the kids in these gangs , they seem like they 're 28 - years - old , but they 're actually only 19			0
they just look old because of the things they 've experienced			0
" " @entity20 " is executive produced by acclaimed @entity5 actors @entity165 and @entity166			1
it impressed judges at this year 's @entity168 so much they awarded it directing and cinematography awards			1
but even after such an ambitious and successful debut , @entity13 is not ready to let up and his next project could n't be more different : a musical with @entity174 collaborator @entity173			2
after all , he said , " if you 're just going to do a paint - by - numbers film , then what 's the point ? "			0
