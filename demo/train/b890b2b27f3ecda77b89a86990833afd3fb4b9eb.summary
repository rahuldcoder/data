@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 lashed out monday at @entity4 , calling the @entity7 tv network 's release of alleged secret documents from @entity10 - @entity3 peace negotiations " shameful			1
" " the report aired by @entity4 is an intentional mixing between the many @entity10 proposals and the @entity3 positions , " @entity2 said in @entity11 , @entity12 , in comments published by the @entity3 news agency @entity14			1
" we do not have anything secret to hide , " he added			0
" all our negotiations and meetings and every issue discussed were presented to @entity25 countries with documents			0
" dozens of @entity28 gathered monday in central @entity29 , burning banners for @entity4 and holding posters comparing the channel to @entity10 , @entity14 reported			1
the documents , which @entity4 has dubbed " the @entity37 , " suggest that @entity3 negotiators offered to give up large swaths of @entity0 to @entity10 during negotiations dating back to 2008			1
they suggest @entity28 have been willing to offer much larger concessions in private than previously acknowledged in public			1
in one document from 2010 , chief @entity3 negotiator @entity41 is quoted as telling a @entity44 official that the @entity3 offer would give @entity10 " the biggest ( @entity0 ) in @entity48 history			1
" in a statement monday , @entity49 said that " a number of reports have surfaced regarding our positions in our negotiations with @entity10 , many of which have misrepresented our positions , taking statements and facts out of context			0
other allegations circulated in the media have been patently false			1
" he added , " our position has been the same for the past 19 years of negotiations : we seek to establish a sovereign and independent @entity3 state along the 1967 borders with @entity0 as its capital and to reach a just solution to the refugee issue based on their international legal rights , " and any proposed agreement " would have to gain popular support through a national referendum			1
" @entity76 , one of @entity2 ' top advisers , accused @entity4 of a " smear campaign			1
" " what happened is a manipulation of the documents and a misrepresentation of the facts and a true distortion , just for mockery and defiance , " @entity76 told reporters			0
former @entity89 prime minister @entity88 , a representative for the @entity90 , told @entity1 he does not believe @entity2 would offer as much territory as the documents suggest			1
the @entity90 -- composed of the @entity93 , the @entity94 , @entity95 , and the @entity96 -- has been trying to broker a peace deal			1
" the idea that the @entity3 leadership had been offering concessions fundamentally in disagreement with the international negotiation that 's known publicly is absurd , " he said , adding that @entity3 leaders have " been sometimes probably too emphatic for the rest of us in their defense of @entity3 interests			1
" the @entity96 special coordinator for the @entity90 peace process , @entity111 , weighed in as well			1
" i can personally attest to the commitment of the @entity3 leadership to secure the legitimate rights and interests of the @entity3 people , based on international law and @entity96 resolutions , " he said , as quoted by @entity14			1
while the @entity3 controls the @entity118 , the militant group @entity117 controls @entity119			1
@entity117 quickly pounced on the @entity4 reporting , condemning the @entity3 team and saying it " does not have credibility to negotiate because it offered essential concessions			1
" " all the doubts and all the concerns of the @entity3 people and the resistance were true , " @entity124 , head of @entity117 foreign relations , said monday in a @entity1 interview from @entity127			2
" those negotiators have no credibility and they are not authorized to negotiate on behalf of the @entity28 because of the division , because there is no united @entity3 institution and because they do n't have cards of power to negotiate with the @entity10			1
" @entity117 , which refuses to recognize @entity10 's right to exist , has carried out numerous terrorist attacks and is branded a terrorist organization by the @entity93 and the @entity94			0
@entity10 prime minister @entity143 's office declined to comment			0
@entity10 foreign minister @entity145 , speaking to @entity10 radio , pointed out that the alleged negotiations took place under former prime minister @entity148 , a more left - wing government than @entity143 's			0
" if the @entity148 government was not able to reach an agreement despite the far - reaching concessions , everyone understands that a long - term interim agreement is what is needed , " @entity145 said			0
@entity156 , a former @entity148 spokesman , said an agreement was almost reached during negotiations between @entity148 and @entity2 from the end of 2006 to september 2008			0
" after dozens of meetings ... there was a proposal that was reached			0
... this offer was on all the issues we call core issues , " @entity156 told @entity10 army radio			0
the core issues in @entity10 - @entity3 negotiations are considered to be the status of @entity0 , borders and refugees			2
@entity76 , the @entity3 official , condemned not only @entity4 , but also the leadership of @entity174 , where the network is based			1
" this is a first - class political smear campaign and the decision comes from the highest level in @entity174 , " @entity76 said , adding sarcastically , " and we thank the emir of @entity174 on his commitment to transparency and to deliver the truth to a wider audience			0
" referring to the " transparency " that @entity4 said it was offering with its reporting , @entity76 added , " we hope that they extend this so - called ' transparency ' to the greatest degree and address the role of the @entity93 base in @entity174 in spying on the @entity25 countries , and talk about @entity174 relations with @entity193 and @entity10			2
" the government of @entity174 had no immediate comment			0
on its website , @entity4 says it was " given unhindered access to the largest - ever leak of confidential documents related to the @entity10 - @entity3 conflict			1
there are nearly 1,700 files , thousands of pages of diplomatic correspondence detailing the inner workings of the @entity10 - @entity3 peace process			2
these documents -- memos , e-mails , maps , minutes from private meetings , accounts of high level exchanges , strategy papers and even ( @entity215 ) presentations -- date from 1999 to 2010			0
" the network added , " we believe this material will prove to be of inestimable value to journalists , scholars , historians , policymakers and the general public			0
we know that some of what is presented here will prove controversial , but it is our intention to inform , not harm , to spark debate and reflection -- not dampen it			0
" @entity76 , however , accused @entity4 of plotting to weaken the @entity3 and @entity2 , @entity14 reported			1
he called on independent @entity3 organizations to set up a committee to look into the authenticity of the documents , according to @entity14			2
he vowed that the @entity3 will not take action against @entity4 staff in the @entity3 territories , the report added			1
@entity4 is not disclosing the source of the documents it received " over the last several months			2
" @entity1 could not immediately verify the authenticity of the documents			0
@entity44 spokesman @entity242 tweeted sunday night , " the @entity93 government is reviewing the alleged @entity3 documents released by @entity4			1
we can not vouch for their veracity			0
" " the @entity93 remains focused on a two - state solution and will continue to work with the parties to narrow existing differences on core issues , " @entity242 added			0
@entity4 said it will be revealing the documents through wednesday			2
the documents outline meetings among @entity10 , @entity3 and @entity93 officials in which @entity3 negotiators offered in 2008 to relinquish claims on nearly all of the settlements built in @entity0			2
the offer was flatly rejected by the @entity10 side , according to the posted documents			0
@entity10 seized the eastern half of @entity0 following war with its @entity25 neighbors in 1967 and considers it the nation 's sovereign capital			0
the claim is rejected by the international community , which considers @entity10 building in @entity0 to be illegal			0
@entity28 want the eastern part of the city as the capital for their future state			2
the leaked documents could prove to be politically damaging for @entity2			0
officials from the @entity29 - based government have consistently condemned growing @entity10 settlements in @entity0 , and disclosures that @entity28 officials were willing to make offers that would allow @entity10 construction to continue were being seized on by critics			2
@entity282 , a @entity117 spokesman in @entity119 , said the leaked internal documents about @entity3 concessions on @entity0 illustrate the collaboration between the @entity3 and @entity10			2
he accused the @entity2 government of working with @entity10 to put an end to the notion of a @entity3 state			2
in addition to details about concessions made on the issue of @entity0 , @entity4 reported that @entity3 officials also offered compromise positions on sensitive issues such as the right of return of @entity3 refugees and control of the @entity301 , where stands the @entity302 , one of the most important sites in @entity305			1
@entity1 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 contributed to this report .			0
