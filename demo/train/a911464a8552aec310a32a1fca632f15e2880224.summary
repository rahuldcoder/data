-- as the tough economy drags on , cost remains a leading consideration that people use to decide which mobile devices and wireless services they 'll purchase			2
@entity8 just took a look at things that will probably cost consumers either more or less in 2012			2
mobile devices featured most prominently on the site 's list of 12 things that will be @entity15 in 2012			1
here 's a roundup of their findings , from a mobile - tech perspective : tablets on the tablet front , writer @entity21 says the @entity23 has , " ahem , ignited a fire among tablet manufacturers as they scramble to match @entity28 's $ 199 price tag			1
for consumers , the competition translates to better tablet bargains in 2012			2
" smaller , cheaper @entity33 - based e-reader tablets are n't really meant to compete directly with fully featured tablets such as the @entity35 or the @entity36			1
they are very different product types that appeal to different market niches -- and as such have significantly different price points			2
the @entity42 tablet deals page regularly lists special offers on new or refurbished tablets , both large and small , and fully featured or limited , on every mobile operating system			1
will the @entity35 be cheaper in 2012 ? maybe , if you do n't need the latest model			1
@entity21 predicts that the @entity35 will see a significant price drop in 2012			1
" the [ widely anticipated ] @entity49 will not feature a significant price drop ( if any at all ) , but one thing is guaranteed -- @entity54 's forthcoming tablet will most certainly bring down the price of refurbished ipad 2s , as the @entity35 did for its predecessor , " he wrote			1
" the @entity35 3 may even cause resellers to offer more deals on new @entity35 2 models as they try to move yesterday 's tech to make room for @entity63 's latest and greatest			1
" e-readers dedicated e-reader devices such as the @entity66 and the @entity67 ( which focus mainly on displaying books and long - format content , rather than web - based services and apps ) are likely to reach all - time low prices in 2012			1
according to @entity42 : " each new generation of @entity28 's @entity66 reader has chipped away at the e-book reader 's price tag , sometimes by as much as 61 %			1
assuming there 's a new kindle in 2012 ( rumor has it that an e-ink update with video support will debut ) , we expect to see continued price cuts on @entity28 's popular e-book reader			2
" as i wrote last year , it 's even possible that @entity28 might start giving away the @entity66 -- maybe in 2012			1
notebooks notebook laptops are also a popular type of mobile device			0
according to @entity21 , 2012 might yield some especially good deals on refurbished @entity94 models			1
" in 2011 the price of a refurbished , fourth - generation 11 - inch @entity94 dropped from $ 849 to $ 699 ( 17 % )			1
not bad for a notebook that 's single - handedly changing the laptop industry			0
@entity63 is bound to refresh its @entity94 in 2012 , and the new model ( which would be the sixth generation ) is guaranteed to drive refurb prices down even lower			2
do n't care for a refurb unit ? in 2011 , we also saw aggressive deals on new , current fifth - generation @entity103 with prices dropping from $ 999 to $ 850 ( 14 % )			1
" gps units as consumers get used to using gps - enabled smartphones and tablets for navigation , @entity42 predicted that standalone gps units ( such as those sold by @entity113 ) will get cheaper than ever			0
" in 2011 , units that were once fetching around $ 160 reached price - lows of just $ 70			2
" in fact , @entity21 wrote , " no gadget is as close to extinction as the gps unit			0
" however , if the recent @entity123 recommendation to ban cell phone use by drivers in cars is implemented by any states or municipalities , sales of gps units might see a resurgence -- since the recommendation exempted devices specifically " designed to support the driving task			0
" what will get more expensive what will cost mobile users more in 2012 ? the @entity42 list of 11 things that will be more expensive in 2012 contained only one reference to mobile : data plans			0
as i wrote last year , perhaps the most important development in the @entity144 mobile landscape in 2011 was that all but one of the major carriers have abandoned unlimited data plans in favor of tiered service			0
this comes as the carriers are rolling out high - speed 4g networks , and @entity144 mobile users are developing a strong taste for data - intensive services like streaming media			0
if you 're on a tiered plan and start using a lot more data , you could end up with a large surprise bill -- or throttled service			0
determined price - conscious consumers have been trying to find tricks to get unlimited data on tiered plans			2
but the carriers can catch on to this -- @entity170 recently closed a loophole that allowed this			0
in october , the @entity173 said it might issue new rules to prevent bill shock			0
the major @entity144 carriers said they would voluntarily start issuing text alerts to customers who near their phone plan caps			0
however , it 's unclear how fast or consistently this alert feature will roll out , and whether it will include alerts related to data consumption			0
so to control your costs , if you use data - intensive mobile services , your best bets are to use @entity189 whenever possible and to install apps or other tools that allow you to keep a close eye on your data usage			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity196 .			0

*analyst* predicts that in 2012 , the @entity35 will see a significant price drop
dedicated e-reader devices such as the @entity66 may also reach all - time low prices
2012 might yield some especially good deals on refurbished @entity205
