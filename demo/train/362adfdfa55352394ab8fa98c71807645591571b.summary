@entity0 -- a third of military children surveyed who have a parent deployed in a war zone are at " high risk " for psychological problems , according to a new study by military doctors and researchers			1
the study concludes there 's a greater chance of family problems upon a military parent 's return			1
the study , published in the @entity18 , surveyed military spouses of deployed @entity21 soldiers with school - age children , aged 5 to 12			1
the questionnaire appraised the strain on the family of dealing with a parent deployed to the war zone			1
results found that stress levels were high for children and spouses of deployed troops but also that support networks from military to religious helped mitigate the problems			1
the number of children found to be high - risk is more than 2Â½ times the national level and higher than historical military samples			1
the authors surveyed 101 families in what they said was the first such evaluation since september 11 , 2001 , and the start of the @entity48 and @entity49 wars			1
overall , there are more than 2 million @entity52 military children , many of whom have parents who have deployed multiple times -- deployments that , for the first time since the @entity59 , can occur as little as 12 months after returning from a previous deployment			1
the study focused on families of active - duty soldiers living on base at @entity65 , @entity0 , and is just a " small snapshot , " said one of the authors , col. @entity67			1
she is the chief of @entity69 at @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity0			0
@entity72 said that more studies would have to be done to understand the impact on military children in other circumstances , like those with parents in other services , living off - base or in the @entity80 , but that the results point to a problem nobody could deny			2
" children struggle when their parents deploy			2
i do n't think anyone will struggle with that , " @entity72 said			0
the survey quantified what @entity72 had seen anecdotally in her work at the hospital			2
" my perception in the school - age range and pre-school - age range was that how the at - home parent is doing is most predictive of how the child is coping , " @entity72 said			2
almost half of the spouses surveyed were found to have a high level of stress , which the authors say has a significant impact on their child 's ability to cope			1
parents surveyed said their children experienced a number of symptoms including " internalizing symptoms " like anxiety , frequent crying and worrying			2
interestingly , it is the return from deployment that is most stressful , according to three - quarters of those surveyed			0
" on reunification , there is excitement , anticipation and relief , occasionally followed by emotional conflict as the service member reintegrates back into the family , " wrote the surveyors			0
effects of deployment on families can be seen beyond the @entity65 survey			1
at @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity129 ' husband is deployed to @entity48 for the second time			2
the mother of two said the return home is as stressful as the deployment itself			0
" trying to relinquish some of the responsibilities that we 've had to take on and give it back to them , " @entity136 said last month			0
she was not a participant in the stress survey			2
" letting go is very difficult			0
very difficult to share the responsibility with your spouse and , ' oh , yeah , you 're in this family ? i forgot			0
' " @entity136 said that this deployment has been easier on her in part because she is living on the base and has access to a support network of wives and staff			0
the strain on families during the reintegration has parallels to families with spouses who travel a lot for business , said @entity167 , distinguished professor emeritus of psychology at the @entity169			2
@entity170 , who has studied the effects of family integration in military and non-military families , agreed with the new study 's conclusion that there is a greater chance of family problems when the spouse comes back			1
" that is when the husband and wife actually fight and talk about stuff , " @entity170 said			0
" the service member comes back and does n't feel a part of it and returns with his own baggage			0
" much work still needs to be done to assess how these psychological effects play out over time , @entity170 said			2
his studies on families of the first @entity193 found that reintegration problems played out in a period lasting around six months to year			1
@entity170 said that it is hard to compare studies from different wars but that duration does point to a key problem in the current conflicts , since many troops are redeploying after a year , meaning the family never really gets a chance to settle back down			0
one surprising result of the new study was what factors were predictors of high - risk impact			1
parents with a college education were less likely to have children at risk , and younger parents fared worse			1
those with college education who were also employed had significantly less stress , which the study authors suggested could be a result of having access to additional support networks , adult interactions and income to relieve stress			1
length of deployment , military rank and children 's age did not have an impact			0
@entity170 said that one reason for the effect of education could be that those in lower social classes tend to deal with more mental health and marital issues in general			0
" how far is the rubber band going to stretch ? " @entity170 asked			0
pre-existing problems are compounded by deployment			0
@entity72 , co-author of the @entity65 - based survey , said that what the study revealed was that those feeling the brunt of the stress were younger families , which are the bulk of enlisted soldiers			1
" what comes with enlistment is usually junior - ranking high - school graduates getting by enough to support a family but often times not ( to ) support child care outside the home , " @entity72 explained			0
that demographic has higher stress because they lack support networks			0
@entity72 said the study highlights the need to understand the impact of deployment on these at risk groups and make sure they have the support they need and " not assuming that everyone has the same needs			1
" she noted that there are resources for families and that more effort is being made to reach out to those who most need help " whether they ask for it or not			0
