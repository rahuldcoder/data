@entity0 's full coverage of the @entity13 oil disaster the exact toll on the @entity13 's ecosystem is still as murky as the ocean waters affected by the disaster			1
this year , as @entity5 approaches , tragedy and uncertainty may once again temper the mood of the annual event : @entity28 is still assessing what could be its worst environmental disaster -- the damage to its @entity33 nuclear power plant by the march 11 earthquake and tsunami			1
the situation has forced other countries , including the @entity3 , to take a closer look at the safety of nuclear power plants within their borders			1
the nuclear issue is still a fierce topic of debate , and environmental experts think it will be an important theme for this year 's @entity5 on april 22			1
recent polls suggest that @entity3 are divided over nuclear energy			0
more than half of the 1,012 respondents in a recent @entity0 poll said they opposed building more nuclear plants , while 46 % said they favored it			0
when asked by @entity0 if they are ok with nuclear energy as a source of electricity , 57 % of the respondents said they approved , while 42 % disapproved			0
despite the crisis in @entity28 , nuclear energy is still a centerpiece of president @entity61 's clean energy policy			1
his administration 's fiscal year 2012 budget request includes $ 36 billion in loan guarantee authority to help spur growth in the nuclear industry			2
energy secretary defends @entity3 nuclear industry nuclear energy produces practically no pollution , and it is more reliable than other clean alternative sources -- like wind and solar energy -- that depend on the weather , according to nuclear power advocate @entity77 , a @entity79 - winning physicist			1
while nuclear is his favorite clean energy source , there are other ways to create electricity that @entity86 believes can help achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases			0
two years ago , @entity86 and 34 other @entity79 laureates wrote a letter to @entity61 to encourage him to put more money into alternative energy research , including nuclear , wind and solar energy and renewable fuels			2
@entity86 , who also teaches at @entity96 , says the @entity3 public needs to pay close attention to how @entity99 is handling environmental issues			0
he is worried that too many people in @entity102 are more concerned about politics than the environment			0
" we 're not going to see a fee on carbon emissions , we 're not going to see cap and trade , we 're going to see a fight to see whether the @entity111 [ @entity111 ] is going to be able to regulate anything , " he predicted			0
" it 's not going to be a pretty year			0
" @entity86 encouraged everyone to use this year 's @entity5 to speak out about the environmental issues that they care about			1

" people need to let their government know , let their representatives know , that they are very concerned about this issue and they are going to hold their representatives accountable for their actions			1
" besides being a call to action , @entity5 also continues to be a good opportunity for public education , he said			2
on april 22 , @entity86 says he 'll probably be speaking on campus about nuclear power , because @entity96 students are interested in what happened in @entity28 and want to be assured that nuclear power is safe			1
@entity135 , director of the @entity136 , says he hopes nuclear concerns do n't overshadow other pressing environmental issues that @entity3 should remember as @entity5 approaches			1
" we have to continue to discuss climate change , because if we get that problem wrong , many of the other things we talk about in the environmental area wo n't matter , " said @entity135 , who also teaches at @entity139			2
both professors were encouraged to see that their students -- although probably not as politically outspoken as their counterparts when @entity5 began in 1970 -- are anxious to learn as much as they can about being environmentally friendly			2
everyone should realize the importance of doing his or her part to help improve the environment for future generations , @entity135 said			0
" sometimes , people focus on the upfront cost rather than on the net benefit , " @entity135 said , referring to the price of more efficient cars , home weatherization products or new heating and cooling units for our houses			0
" individuals have a much larger role than they realize in both contributing to environmental problems and to the solutions			2

@entity5 will be held on april 22
a year ago , the environmental *community* was concerned about the @entity13 oil spill
