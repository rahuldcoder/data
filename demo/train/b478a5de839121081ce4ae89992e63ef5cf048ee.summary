@entity1 , @entity0 -- it is news that will be greeted with despair and joy in equal measure in family homes across the globe -- computer games might be good for children			0
according to scientists at @entity18 in @entity1 , " young people can experience huge benefits from participating in multi player online role playing games "			1
children playing online games have their imaginations stimulated , not stunted			1
on the one hand , parents will be pleased to learn that their offspring are n't wasting their time as they sit boggle - eyed in front of a computer screen , and may actually be learning important life skills needed in adulthood			2
but on the other , it 's just another excuse for their children to spend hour upon hour locked away in their bedroom neglecting school studies and family duties			0
still , there 's always the off switch			0
dr @entity36 and @entity37 of @entity18 's @entity38 have just completed a three - year study of 13 - 16 year olds playing @entity41 -- a massively popular online with over nine million members worldwide			1
the findings are in contrast to ongoing criticism that children are spending too much time indoors -- either voluntarily watching television and playing computer games or at the request of concerned parents afraid to let them play in the street or in parks , where they could be the victim or a perpetrator of crime			2
this so - called " bedroom culture " is , it is often argued , creating a generation of monosyllabic , culturally illiterate group of youngsters who are ill - prepared for the impending roles and responsibilities of adulthood			0
researchers have found that far from constricting young people 's imagination , @entity41 and similar multiplayer virtual games enhance brain activity			1
they offer an opportunity to experiment with different identities such as gender , race or ability			0
gamers can also benefit from opportunities that they may not have access to in the real world			0
" virtual environments , like @entity41 , " says @entity37 , " form important new leisure spaces for the many young people who occupy them			1
in the real world , where streets or town centers have become inaccessible to many young people or are considered risky by them or their parents , it is not surprising that virtual public space has become increasingly attractive as a leisure setting			1
" @entity41 is one of the most popular multiplayer online role - playing games ( @entity95 ) and attracts all age groups , but is particularly popular with teenagers			1
players can explore a virtual world which takes its inspiration from children 's fantasy games and books -- think @entity104 and @entity105 and @entity107 's @entity106 -- incorporating dungeons , vast landscapes , forests and towns , with monsters to slay , quests to complete and treasure to find			0
the @entity41 website describes the game as " an evolving world of remarkable depth and flexibility "			2
" our research " , says @entity37 , " explored how @entity41 's appeal lay in the provision of an environment in which young people can experiment ( symbolically ) with the cultural institutions and structures of the material world -- a space in which young people can establish their presence , identity and meaning in ways that might not be accessible or permissible in their everyday lives			1
" @entity41 is n't just about combat			0
if you do n't want to fight the monsters you can take on the role of a craftsman providing the tools of battle			0
players can also trade goods and services and build up skills through interaction with other characters			0
the study revealed that many of the players were entrepreneurial , engaging in business deals online			0
dr @entity36 says " at a time when emerging technologies such as the @entity160 , and computer games in particular , continue to be subject to suspicion and concern , it is important that we also recognize the benefits of what is an increasingly popular and important activity for our young people			1
" the @entity18 research findings follow hot on the heels of claims by computer giant @entity166 that online games are helping to groom future business leaders			2
multiplayer online games are teaching children the core skills which are required to lead a team			2
online games like @entity41 , @entity174 and @entity175 allow players to join forces and work in closely - knit teams to achieve a goal that may take hours or sometimes weeks to complete			1
with the help of @entity189 , @entity183 and @entity184 ( a company who specialize in computer work solutions ) @entity166 's research paper " virtual worlds , @entity181 " suggests that @entity95 's can train leaders to deal with motivational , social and emotional needs of their team			0
" if you want to see what business leadership may look like in three to five years , look at what is happening in online games , " says @entity193 , professor of communication at @entity189			2
according to @entity166 , online games also give leaders the freedom to fail and to experiment with different approaches which , they say , is something that any @entity204 company that hopes to innovate needs to understand			1
