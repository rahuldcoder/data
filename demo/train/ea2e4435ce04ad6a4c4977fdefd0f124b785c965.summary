-- it 's a really good year to be a bold and bad - ass chick in @entity3			1
this weekend , " @entity4 : catching @entity15 " broke box office records , catapulting @entity7 's @entity6 to superhero status on the big screen and putting her in the ranks with other megafranchises , including ( male - dominated ) " @entity12 , " " @entity13 " and " @entity14			0
" movies in those franchises held on to the top three slots on the list of highest grossing opening weekends of all time , but " @entity22 " came in at a strong no. 4 with $ 161 million , beating out " @entity23 , " " @entity24 " and the " @entity26 " franchise			1
and " @entity4 " franchise is only at the halfway mark of its life on the big screen -- the third book , " @entity31 , " will be split into two movies , meaning there 's still plenty of time for @entity36 to fight their way to that no. 1 slot			0
it 's not just new faces getting all the attention			0
@entity42 just named @entity43 their entertainer of the @entity45 on the heels of the success of " gravity , " which is getting plenty of @entity51 buzz , and female buddy cop comedy " @entity53			1
" @entity43 has been acting for more than 25 years -- longer than @entity7 has been alive -- but that has n't stopped the @entity51 winner from being one of the most consistent top earners in @entity3			1
the @entity7 quotebook " @entity53 , " which co-starred fellow female favorite @entity62 , grossed almost $ 160 million at the box office ; " gravity " did even better , bringing in more than $ 245 million already since its october premiere			2
but it 's @entity43 's ability to shift so effortlessly from comedies to dramas to a sci - fi thriller such as " gravity " -- which is basically just a one - woman show , a character study set in space -- that keeps her at the top of so many moviegoers ' must - see lists			0
on the music side , the @entity75 were another shining example this weekend that women are dominating			1
yes , plenty of men took home top awards , but it was the women making all the headlines			1
from memorable performances by @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 to @entity90 winning artist of the year for a record third time and @entity93 taking home the @entity95 , women dominated the show , the social media chatter about the show and all the morning - after conversations			1
@entity87 : confessions of pop 's wildest child @entity87 has been on an envelope - and conservative button - pushing tear lately , with a tongue - out , twerk - filled , nearly nude and super sexy performance with @entity108 at @entity110 's @entity109 , followed by an equally bizarre showing at the network 's @entity112 , where she lit a joint and smoked it on stage			2
the controversy is only fueling the fire : her album " @entity121 " topped the charts , making it the year 's biggest - selling album for a solo female artist this year with 270,000 copies sold			1
compare that with her last album , " @entity130 , " which peaked at no. 3 on the charts in 2010 with only 102,000 copies sold , and it 's clear that @entity87 ' professional success has grown as her antics have grabbed more headlines			0
why we love @entity7 @entity90 , on the other hand , has made a career out of being the good ( but always romantically scorned ) girl next door			0
and what a career it is -- at just 23 , she 's making an estimated $ 55 million this year , which includes endorsement deals and her budding acting career			2
without licking anyone or humping any foam fingers on stage , @entity90 keeps her fans satisfied by churning out hit after hit and remaining humble while still being delightfully uncensored			0
when accepting artist of the year again this weekend , she very sincerely thanked her fans for making 2013 her best year , then joked that she 's scared for it to be over			2
luckily for her , that should n't be a problem -- @entity90 is already teasing her next album			0
what can we take away from all of this ? while these are all examples of female successes on different sides of the industry , there are just as many big misses			2
in movies , while many people claim that roles for women are on the rise , studies show otherwise : in 2012 , @entity170 at @entity171 found that of all the speaking roles in movies released that year , only 28.4 % of those roles were for women			0
with women making up more than 50 % of the movie - going audience , those numbers need to shift to meet demand			1
a few huge female - centric hits does not a new @entity3 make			1
from @entity87 ' tongue - wagging to @entity183 's aw - shucks - ness , it 's nice for audiences -- young women especially -- to see strong and creative women on top			0
now we just need to see more of them			0

female actors and musicians seem to be dominating pop *culture* lately
from " @entity22 " to the best @entity75 performances , women are making waves
but @entity3 still has a way to go to *achieve* true equality for women
