@entity0 -- northeast @entity3 state attorney @entity2 has made it clear that she alone will decide whether @entity5 will be charged in the shooting death of @entity7			1
@entity5 's attorneys termed as " courageous " her decision not to present evidence to the grand jury that the original prosecutor , @entity12 , scheduled to convene on april 10			1
the @entity7 family was also pleased that @entity14 would make the charging decision			0
but the question remains , will @entity5 be charged ? tuesday , in a bizarre development , @entity5 's attorneys , @entity18 and @entity19 , during a news conference held in front of the @entity23 , announced that they had withdrawn from his representation			1
they said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed @entity5 's unusual behavior -- including phone calls to @entity30 host @entity29 and the special prosecutor , @entity14			1
the attorneys also said that they are concerned with @entity5 's emotional and physical well - being and even suggested that he may be suffering from @entity33 ( post traumatic stress disorder )			1
in short , they said that their client had gone rogue			0
clients fire attorneys every day , for no reason or any reason			0
and attorneys withdraw from cases around the country daily			0
but it is rarely done so publicly and with so much information divulged about the inner workings of the lawyer - client relationship			0
@entity47 clients that are potential defendants spook prosecutors			0
it can be a nightmare to try to locate and arrest a fleeing defendant			0
not surprisingly , within hours of the now - infamous withdrawal , @entity14 issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours " to release new information regarding the @entity7 shooting death investigation			2
" many suspect that the announcement that @entity5 had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor 's hand			1
by all accounts though , @entity2 is a seasoned career prosecutor who does n't bend to public opinion or political pressure			2
during her 25 years as an assistant state attorney , @entity14 tried hundreds of cases , including more than 50 homicides			1
during her three - year - plus as state attorney of the 4th @entity75 , @entity73 's @entity72 jail has seen an increase in the population , despite a drop in crime in the city			1
some say this is a direct result of her aggressive prosecutorial bent			0
but her career has n't been without controversy			0
recently she came under intense fire for charging 12 - year - old @entity87 as an adult in the killing of his 2 - year - old brother , making @entity92 the youngest person in @entity3 ever to be charged as an adult			0
@entity14 , a devout @entity94 , references her faith in discussing her cases , which some would say is a no - no for a prosecutor			0
in a written statement she provided in response to her detractors about the @entity87 case , @entity14 defended her decision to charge @entity87 as an adult by stating , " we are blessed in the @entity106 to have a great working relationship with ... public defenders , " and " we asked for prayers for our two - year - old victim , @entity110 , and for @entity87			2
" in discussing the investigation into the shooting death of @entity7 she said , " what we are asking people to do is take a step back			0
i believe these are wonderful people who are asking for a peaceful approach to this case , while still demanding the answers they deserve			0
and i look forward to meeting with them to try to help them on this journey			0
our victims always have a tough plight			0
" if she files charges against @entity5 , it would be wise not to " overcharge " the case			1
@entity14 needs to be able to prove her case beyond a reasonable doubt			0
to prove manslaughter in @entity3 , @entity14 's team would have to prove that @entity5 's acts caused @entity7 's death			1
manslaughter would not be difficult to prove but for @entity3 's " stand your ground " law			1
@entity3 's law states that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force , including deadly force ... to prevent death or great bodily harm			1
so even if @entity5 killed @entity7 , he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm			1
it seems the @entity163 certainly believed @entity5 's claims			1
but there is an exception			0
if @entity5 was the initial aggressor , he can not avail himself of the protection of the " stand your ground " law			1
former @entity173 rep. @entity172 , the co-sponsor of the law , told me by phone that the law does n't apply to @entity5 if he pursued @entity7 and was the initial aggressor			1
@entity3 's statute makes it clear that the justification is not available to a person who initially provokes the use of force against himself , unless such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape			1
and that is what this case ultimately boils down to -- who started the fight			0
and the answer to that question is far from clear			2
@entity7 left the home of his father 's fiancee on february 26 to buy skittles and an ice tea			0
@entity5 left his home to go to @entity204 and was carrying a concealed weapon for which he had a permit			1
@entity7 was 17 years old , @entity5 , 28			1
the police report describes @entity7 as 6 feet tall and 160 pounds and lists @entity5 as 5 - foot - 9			1
@entity5 sees @entity7 , deems him " suspicious " and calls the police			1
@entity5 tells the dispatcher he is following @entity7			2
the dispatcher tells @entity5 " we do n't need you to do that			2
" @entity7 notices @entity5 is following him and tells his girlfriend , @entity215 , with whom he is on the phone			2
she tells him to run , and he agrees to walk quickly			0
@entity5 says that he returns to his parked suv and is attacked suddenly by @entity7			2
@entity215 hears someone ask @entity7 why he is there			0
@entity7 asks @entity5 why he is following him			2
@entity215 believes she hears @entity7 being tackled			0
witnesses say they heard angry words , heard someone crying for help ( many explain it sounded like the voice of a younger person ) and then a single gunshot			0
the screams for help stop			0
three witnesses saw @entity5 straddling @entity7 in the grass			2
the incident happens 70 yards from the home @entity7 was walking to , not near @entity5 's @entity218			1
@entity7 is found dead , laying on his stomach			0
@entity5 is bleeding from his nose and the back of his head and has stains on the back of his jacket			2
@entity5 is n't tested for drug or alcohol consumption and is allowed to leave the police station with the clothes he was wearing that night			2
a tenet of our legal system is that when there is conflicting evidence , let a jury decide			1
i believe in our jury system			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			2

@entity260 : the state attorney has made it clear that she alone will decide on charges
she says the public withdrawal by lawyers representing @entity5 was strange
@entity260 : @entity5 's actions may not have been covered by the " stand your ground " law
she says she believes in the jury system ; it makes sense to let a jury decide
