-- it seems that the global super-rich like their private jets on the bland side			1
no matter if you 're the ceo of a @entity9 company or electronics tycoon from @entity11 , it 's likely a dark wood veneer and light - colored leather upholstery will envelop you in the lap of luxury at 38,000 feet			1
even the bright red and yellow livery of kung - fu superstar @entity19 's new jet ( that came with his role as " ambassador " for @entity23 plane - maker @entity22 ) , gives way to a spotless interior of mid-tones and cream leather seats			1
if it does n't seem to fit the persona of the martial arts actor , the companies that are fighting over the executive jet market are well aware that giving clients whatever they want , even if that is uniform luxury , is essential when it comes to securing a multi-million dollar sale of an aircraft			1
battle for the skies at @entity39 " it 's the cabin that sells the aircraft , " says @entity40 , of @entity41 , from the back of a voluminous sofa on board a champagne - colored @entity45			1
" usually clients just need it to be practical			2
" if you can afford a $ 65 million jet like the @entity52 ( based on the commercial @entity53 ) , fluctuating fuel costs are n't as much of a concern as a spacious bedroom and enough space for a banquet in the sky			0
a round table that can convert into a square for mahjong games is an off - the - shelf option for @entity40 's prospective @entity65 clients , who are also being targeted with laser - like precision by the other big corporate jet companies like @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity22 , @entity70 and @entity71			1
just 15 years ago there was only one corporate jet in @entity65 , and private jet ownership was illegal in the country until 2003			0
now there are over 200 private and executive jets in @entity65 and around 700 in @entity11 , according to @entity22			1
however that 's a small fraction of the total number of private planes criss - crossing the globe -- @entity11 still only has about a 5 % global share , compared to @entity84 's 40 % , the company says			1
@entity65 's challenge for air supremacy but while bigger can mean better in the high status world of private jets , the market for smaller four or six - seater jets , accessible to millionaires , not billionaires , is increasing			1
analysts predict that @entity11 is worth around $ 40 billion to the private jet market in the next 10 years , although there could be some bumps along the way for companies hoping to cash in on the privacy mores of high - net - worth flyers			1
" it 's not a recession - proof industry , " says @entity101 , vice president of @entity103 jets for @entity104			2
like many other businesses , @entity108 's precarious economic position is the main worry for private jet manufacturers			1
" the drivers of this market remain the same ; it 's how the economies are performing , how the companies are doing , how the stock markets are , " says @entity101			2
" we still have a lot of the bottlenecks ( in @entity11 ) that the @entity120 has overcome over the last 30 to 40 years -- access to airspace and dedicated infrastructure like private jet terminals and common regulations			0
they will be smoothed out in time			0
" test your aviation knowledge courting clients and getting them to part with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars is one thing , but dealing with their demands once the plane is in the air is another			2
" every owner is different , " says @entity136 , ceo of @entity137 that manages six private planes in @entity65 , including the @entity19 jet			0
the company is one of many springing up to serve @entity65 's private jet owners with air and ground crew			2
" some owners do n't want to be bothered at all during a flight , but one might want his ashtray to be cleaned after two cigarettes			0
one gentleman , for example , if he was to land in @entity152 to refuel would expect a blanket to be handed to him , immigration forms to be filled out , that kind of thing			0
" @entity158 , a former finance executive from @entity159 , expects @entity160 to double its client list in the coming year			0
her company and others like it are learning to deal with the spontaneous whims of the owners			0
that could be having a pilot and stewardess ready to go in a couple of hours for a flight to a different city just for dinner or jetting off for a @entity175 hunt in @entity176			0
" some are very particular , often about little things like table - wear and having their own and favorite chopsticks			0
" demanding , yes , " but they 're all very nice ! " she adds .			0

most *buyers* of private jets seek uniform luxury , companies say
" it 's the cabin that sells the aircraft , " one aircraft executive *explains*
manufacturers will meet clients ' demands for interior extras
fears @entity108 debt crisis will stifle demand for luxury jets
