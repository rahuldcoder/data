editor 's note : @entity2 directs the @entity3 at the @entity4 and publishes the @entity5 , a popular political blog			2
@entity2 says the @entity8 panel correctly decided @entity10 's approach to diplomacy holds great promise			1
@entity13 ( @entity14 ) -- cynics will say that @entity16 was jealous that @entity17 , @entity18 , scored a visit from president @entity10 , and giving him a @entity8 was the only way to get him to @entity23			0
but the @entity25 's decision to make @entity10 the only sitting @entity27 president since @entity28 to receive the @entity29 shows the committee 's clear - headed assessment that @entity10 's " unclenched fist " approach to dealing with the world 's most thuggish leaders has had a constructive , systemic impact on the world 's expectations of itself			1
@entity10 has helped citizens all around the world -- including in the @entity27 -- to want a world beyond the mess we have today in the @entity44 and @entity45			1
they want a world where @entity27 is benign and positive , and where other leaders help in supporting the struggles of their people for better lives rather than securing themselves through crude power			0
@entity10 has found a way in this interconnected world of cell phones , @entity55 , @entity56 and other social networking to reach a majority of the world 's citizens with his message of hope for a better world			1
he speaks past the dictators to regular people and has , on the whole , raised global political expectations about everything from climate change to nuclear nonproliferation in ways that no one in history has done before			0
@entity27 tend to look at everything from a @entity27 - centric lens , and many woke up this morning shocked that @entity10 , who just saw a lot of his political capital wasted on trying to secure the @entity79 for his hometown of @entity81 , has gotten a fresh injection of sizzle to fill the @entity10 bubble			1
the world has been mesmerized by @entity10 since he started to run for the presidency			0
the battle between @entity88 and @entity10 for the @entity90 nomination did more to educate the rest of the world about real political choice -- and about a system in which no candidates had an automatic lock on victory -- than any @entity99 program could have achieved			2
@entity10 's decision to make the ulcerous @entity104 - @entity103 negotiations one of the first foreign policy challenges of his administration , rather than the last , defied most seasoned analysts ' expectations			1
his message to @entity111 's citizens , marking the @entity113 new year holiday of @entity114 , and his powerful and captivating speech in @entity116 , @entity117 , communicated to @entity118 all around the world that their lives and their faith and their expectations for a better world were vital and as valid as any others			0
from his perch in the @entity126 , @entity10 affirmed the humanity of @entity118 and told them that @entity27 does value @entity118 lives			2
@entity10 's posture and rhetoric have reversed the collapse of hope and trust that the world 's citizens had in @entity27 and stopped the degradation of @entity27 's image during the tenure of @entity137 and @entity138			1
should a @entity27 president get the @entity29 if he 's about to send more @entity27 troops , armed drones , bombs , tanks and other military hardware into the war - ripped zones in @entity146 ? or should @entity10 get the prize if he has n't even succeeded in getting @entity104 - @entity103 negotiations going ? or if he has n't gotten @entity111 to drop its nuclear ambitions and to re-enter the international system on constructive terms ? the answer is yes			1
i think that given how the odds were already so stacked against @entity10 on the global economic and security fronts , one can only be amazed at what this unlikely and fascinating president has done with " optics			0
" the night before @entity10 's inauguration , @entity126 chief of staff @entity160 accepted my congratulations and responded , " it 's going to be tough , and right now we can only change the optics , " meaning that political perceptions and appearances could be changed more quickly than hard realities			1
what is brilliant about @entity10 and why he deserves the @entity29 is that he is a global leader who clearly saw the gains that could be made in changing " the optics " of the global order , upgrading the level of respect between the @entity27 and other nations , making a point of listening to other leaders			1
@entity10 saw that before the world could move to a more stable and better global equilibrium , it had to believe it could -- and this is what @entity10 has done in ways that no other leader has in memory			0
@entity10 will still make mistakes			0
leaders will still wrestle with him			0
hard choices and the gravity of war will still generate challenges for @entity10 's leadership			2
but the @entity25 has shrewdly given a key down payment for a kind of leadership it wants to see from the @entity27 for many more years and given @entity10 another tool to help craft a new global social contract between the @entity27 and other responsible stakeholders in the international system			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : many @entity27 shocked that @entity10 won @entity29
he says the rest of the world sees how @entity10 has changed international tone
he says @entity10 's rhetoric has " reversed the collapse of hope " in the world
