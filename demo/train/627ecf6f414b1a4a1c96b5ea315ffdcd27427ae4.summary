-- if 21st century @entity1 is a story struggling for equality in the global community of stories , to paraphrase @entity1 's most famous novelist , @entity7 , then @entity8 , @entity9 , and international aid and charity organizations are not the only actors seeking a space in that narrative			1
@entity1 too is seeking a space in her own story -- the first step in telling and owning her own story			1
for @entity23 actors in the @entity24 , there is a story ; for @entity27 , there are stories			2
perhaps , folks have been a tad harsh on the @entity31			0
perhaps there has been a little progress , a slight evolution in their narrative			0
in the 20th century , the @entity31 saw @entity37 as @entity1			1
in the 21st century , the tally of countries allowed to stand in for the entire continent has increased to three : @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43			0
gone are the days when a single country could function as @entity1 's metonym			2
across @entity1 , there are folks who challenge this narrative with alternative stories showcasing the continent 's boundless energy , genius , innovation , and youth opportunity			2
these @entity27 voices insist that they know it is @entity58			0
they insist that their hard work has rebuilt @entity61 to the point where that @entity27 country now has to bail out debt - ridden and economically - stagnating @entity64 in @entity66 with financial aid and bailouts			0
there is a third force in the struggle to narrate @entity1			2
this third force is opposed to the narrative of the @entity31 but does not rush to embrace the euphoric counter-narratives of the new voices of @entity27 hope either			0
yet , you can not accuse her of racism or not wanting the best for @entity1			2
she is @entity1 's new diaspora in @entity81			1
and she is insisting that @entity1 's new story will not be told without her			1
she left @entity1 at the beginning of the 1980s when murderous military despotism , combined with a deadly cocktail of ruinous policies imposed by the @entity88 and the @entity89 to empty the continent of hope			2
now , this activist diaspora insists on her story of @entity1			1
she is saying that new narratives of progress must not overlook the albatross of corruption and poor governance			1
social media has enhanced her activism , allowing her to intervene and shape opinion in individual @entity27 countries in a manner that is unprecedented			1
her relentless scrutiny of the narratives of progress and hope often pitches her against the state in @entity1			1
ordinary citizens in @entity1 also sometimes view the vocal intervention and activism of the new diaspora with suspicion			1
" you are always talking about corruption and poor governance as if that were the only story in @entity1			1
what is the difference between you and those who only see @entity118 in @entity1 ? who made you a referee on @entity27 issues from the safety of @entity81 ? after all , you abandoned the continent when the going was tough ! " these are the usual arguments with which @entity1 delegitimizes her new diaspora on social media			1
but this new diaspora will not be shooed away easily			0
she insists on her legitimacy , brandishing the monetary remittances she makes annually to the continent			0
diaspora remittances now outweigh @entity23 aid to @entity1			1
the @entity136 reports that in 2010 , @entity27 living outside of the continent remitted $ 51.8 billion to the continent			0
in the absence of formal welfare mechanisms in many @entity27 countries , diaspora remittances fill the void			0
" if i am sending this sort of money to the continent " , says the new diaspora , " i have a stake in her stories			0
i can criticize corruption and poor governance			1
i can be dissatisfied with mediocrity			0
i will not be silenced "			0
defying silence is what led to the story of @entity157 , one of @entity1 's most phenomenal diaspora success stories			1
founded by @entity160 - based @entity159 , @entity157 is an online news dedicated to fighting corruption in @entity163			2
it has become the go - to medium for international news organizations for @entity163 news			0
@entity157 ' website nets over two million visits per month			0
her @entity171 fan page has over a million likes			0
yet , @entity159 and his syndicated columnists , myself included , are always attacked by the @entity163 state and irritated citizens based mostly on the fact that their intervention in @entity163 affairs is done from the @entity182 and @entity183			0
in @entity186 this weekend , organizers of @entity185 , will assemble some of @entity1 's best to discuss the theme , facing forward			2
in my view , the speakers , a healthy mix of @entity27 based in the continent and @entity81 , will confront an important question : can @entity1 face forward by delegitimizing her new diaspora ? @entity196 : ' do i look like i have @entity118 ? ' more from @entity27 voices the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity200 is one of the speakers at the @entity1 - *focused* @entity204 event on *december* 6
he says that activist diaspora insists on her story of @entity1 -- and social media has enhanced its voice
" new narratives of progress must not overlook the albatross of corruption and poor governance "
