@entity196 and other organizations such as @entity206 that have been working on the @entity9 outbreak since the beginning have been asking for additional international help for months			1

earlier in the day he met with president @entity4 , who told him about the expanded @entity7 efforts			1
@entity225 said he thanked the president , and urged @entity125 to back this plan up with " immediate action			2
" ebola survivor donates blood to infected @entity7 " as a survivor , it is not only my privilege , but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of @entity10 who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease , " @entity225 said			1
he told the story about a patient named @entity244 who he believes may have been saved had the world acted sooner			2
the patient became infected after carrying a neighbor sick with @entity9 to a taxi to get him to a hospital			2
" if someone had gone alongside @entity244 and given him a little education and given him the equipment he needed , his family would have a father , " @entity225 said			0
instead his patient died and the world lost " this good samaritan			2
" @entity225 went on to respond to the analogy some have used to describe @entity9 as a fire burning out of control			1
he warned , it is a " fire			2
it is a fire straight from the pit of hell			1
" " we can not fool ourselves into thinking that the vast @entity266 will protect us from the flames of this fire , " @entity225 said			2
move quickly , he urged , as it is " the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes			0
" could the virus mutate ? there is also a concern about the possibility that the virus could mutate into an even more dangerous form			0
@entity9 currently transmits only though contact with bodily fluids ; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to people worldwide , health experts say			2
@entity175 press secretary @entity284 said monday that there was still a " very low " likelihood the ebola virus could mutate in a way that threatens the @entity7			2
can @entity40 's economy survive @entity9 ? " right now , the risk of an @entity9 outbreak in the @entity7 is very low , " he said , " but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the @entity7			1

political systems and infrastructure are fragile in the countries where the virus is concentrated			0
@entity24 , @entity40 and @entity39 are still rebuilding their economies after suffering through years of civil wars			0
" now their capacity to deliver the necessities of daily life for their people is on the brink of collapse , " @entity333 said			0
" the @entity9 outbreak poses a serious threat to their post-conflict recovery			2
" more people are believed to have died in these countries from secondary diseases like malaria and tuberculosis and from chronic illnesses and pregnancies with complications than from @entity9 because the health care systems are so strained			2
heavy rain adds to the risk of waterborne diseases like malaria			0
food security has also become a problem			0
quarantines keep workers from their jobs and have slowed the delivery of food to certain areas , according to the @entity320 " we must act now if we want to avoid greater humanitarian consequences in future , " @entity333 said .			0
