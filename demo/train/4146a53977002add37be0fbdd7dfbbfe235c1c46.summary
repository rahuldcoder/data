-- as awful as @entity4 guard @entity2 's leg injury appeared during sunday night 's @entity6 game against @entity7 , @entity2 could be back on the court in six months to a year , an orthopedic surgeon says			1
fans across @entity10 averted their eyes in horror sunday night as @entity2 , 20 , came down wrong on his leg , causing a gruesome break			1
his right tibia , or shinbone , broke through the skin in what 's called an open or compound fracture			1
open fractures often cause damage to the surrounding muscles , tendons and ligaments , according to the @entity25			2
" this type of fracture is particularly serious because once the skin is broken , infection both the wound and the bone can occur , " the academy 's website states			2
@entity2 was immediately taken to an @entity35 hospital			0
in a two - hour surgery , his bone was reset and a rod inserted into his tibia , according to a statement from @entity41 , senior associate athletic director for media relations at the @entity43			1
that 's typical procedure for this kind of injury , says orthopedic surgeon dr. @entity48 of @entity49 , who is not involved in @entity2 's care			2

then a steel or titanium rod is placed inside the hollow leg bone to reconnect it where it broke			2

@entity75 -- who also is not involved in @entity2 's care -- said it 's also possible @entity2 had a benign bone tumor that weakened the tibia before his fall			1
if there is no nerve damage , @entity75 says , doctors will probably get @entity2 up and moving the day after surgery			1
and with intensive daily physical therapy , he could be back on the basketball court in six months to a year			0
of course , with serious injuries comes the risk of serious complications , according to the @entity25			0
