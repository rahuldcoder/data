-- @entity1 has gripped our border			2
i am not talking about the migrant children fleeing from crime and violence in their home countries in @entity9 and looking for the opportunity to live a better life			2
i am talking about the misguided protestersâ € ” and the right - wing public officials that egg them on , railing against anything they think even might be an immigrant			1
here is an example : on tuesday a group of protesters in @entity24 , @entity25 , whipped up by a local sheriff known for his extremist views on immigration , mistakenly blocked a bus full of @entity31 children			2
they thought the kids were unaccompanied minors from @entity9 being bussed to a local facility where they would be cared for			2
in the same incident , @entity35 , an opportunistic local @entity36 congressional candidate , who was slightly behind the curve , jumped in to claim that when he went to confront the bus , he saw fear in the faces of the " migrant " children because of the lack of rule of law and enforcement			1
when a reporter clued him in about the @entity31 , an awkward back - pedal ensued			2
it would be comical if it were not so serious			0
@entity9 's crisis on the border needs solutions , but they must live up to our @entity53 values and reflect who we are as a country			1
and they must be bipartisan			0
@entity36 need to get hold of themselves , understand facts and keep their anti-immigrant extremist voices in check			1
if they do n't do it for the country 's future , they should at least do it for their own political survival			0
republicans can not afford to further alienate the county 's largest minority			0
if the @entity36 does not reverse its lack of @entity73 support , it can say good - bye to its chances of getting to the @entity76			1
so , how about dropping the political posturing and perhaps redeeming the party in the face of a crisis that could not be more personal to @entity81 ? this may be too much to ask			0
take sen. @entity83 of @entity84			0
his solution is a hard - line approach , demanding that any legislation dealing with the border crisis include an end to the president 's @entity90			1
@entity90 allows children brought here by parents , through no fault of their own , to remain in the only country they know and to contribute without fear of deportation			0
@entity83 's fix would deport @entity100 ' who have not yet applied or been granted deferral			2
even some @entity36 acknowledge that deporting children who have been here their whole lives , sometimes becoming valedictorians and serving in the @entity53 military ( or expressing a desire to do so ) makes no sense and is no solution to the crisis			1
but @entity83 is walking in lockstep with nativist - and - proud @entity112 rep. @entity111			2
one of the few immigration bills that passed this @entity114 was sponsored by @entity111 and called for the deportation of all of these so - called @entity100 kids			1
not unusual for a congressman who can not talk about immigrants without talking about criminals			0
such dehumanization of immigrants as " the other " is too common on the right			0
( one @entity36 elected official , a @entity123 state legislator , once went so far as to " joke " that shooting undocumented immigrants from helicopters might be a good way to keep them in check			1
) come on , @entity36 , callous grandstanding only proves to the @entity53 people you are interested in politicking , not governing			1
to do that , you will have to acknowledge facts			0
@entity84 gov. @entity135 said this past sunday that president @entity137 's request for emergency funding did not include enough money for border security			1
he also suggested the @entity141 be called in to stand at the @entity142 to act as a " deterrent " for the unaccompanied minors and women crossing the border			2
he and other @entity36 claimâ € ” ludicrously -- that president @entity137 needs to secure the border and that they ca n't trust him to enforce immigration laws why is this ludicrous ? the fact is this president has been a stronger enforcer of our deportation laws than any other president before him , even to the chagrin of some of his allies , who have dubbed him the deporter - in - chief			1
the fact is this president has tripled enforcement resources on the border and doubled the number of border patrol agents , which is more than any other president in recent history has done			2
the fact is that during the @entity169 administration , the undocumented population added anywhere from 3 million to 4 million people			0
its growth under president @entity137 has been net negative			1
even if 100,000 children ultimately show up at the border this year and all of them end up staying , the growth of the undocumented population under president @entity137 will still be less than zero compared with any other recent @entity53 president			1
the fact is these children are not a national security threat			0
they are not fleeing from @entity185 agents			0
they are doing exactly the opposite and turning themselves in to the first law enforcement agents they see			0
calling out the @entity141 , as @entity135 has suggested , would not deter them ; it might even give these migrants more hope , because there would be more law enforcement officials in whose arms they could collapse			0
the fact is , had the bipartisan @entity200 immigration bill passed , with its stronger border protection measures and strategies for facilitating legal flows of workers at the borders , the country could have spoken out loud and clear to potential immigrants about the @entity53 ' immigration policy			1
it would have made it much harder for criminal actors to distort our country 's position and for smugglers to take advantage of parents who only want a better life for their children			0
but instead of working with the president and @entity232 on reforming our badly broken immigration systemâ € ” a reform that majorities of @entity53 , including @entity36 voters , support -- the @entity36 is capitulating to the most extreme factions of their party who scream " amnesty " at the top of their lungs whenever talk of immigration comes along			1
then they blame president @entity137 for sending the wrong signals to other countries ? now , @entity36 in @entity114 not only refuse to take up any immigration bill this year , but are balking at the $ 3.7 billion emergency package the president has requested to address the situation at hand			1
they do n't get to have it both ways			0
they can not yell that the house in on fire and then cut off the water supply to put that fire out			0
right now @entity36 may prefer a pure red meat strategy on the border crisis , led by their anti-immigrant nativist wing and designed to draw the narrow base to the polls , but if they do n't find a way to work on real solutions -- and fast -- political reality will be abrupt and ugly for the @entity36 come 2016 and beyond .			1

@entity257 : border protests show madness of right - wing to all things immigration
she says there is dire need for solutions , but @entity36 blocks them , puts politics over governance
she says @entity36 holds $ 3.7 billion in aid *hostage* , ludicrously claims @entity137 not strong on border
@entity257 : @entity36 fires up base , but it will need @entity73 votes , must show its desire to fix *problems*
