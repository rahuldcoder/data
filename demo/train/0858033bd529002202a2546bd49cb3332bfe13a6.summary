@entity0 -- president @entity3 's spokesman criticized the @entity5 government on tuesday for arresting and harassing journalists and rights activists , and called comments by vice president @entity9 that @entity5 is not ready for democracy " particularly unhelpful			1
" the remarks by @entity14 press secretary @entity13 reflected a growing @entity16 dissatisfaction with @entity5 president @entity11 and @entity9 , the intelligence officer @entity11 chose as his deputy to bring about reforms demanded by protesters who have convulsed @entity20 and the @entity5 economy for more than two weeks			1
in another sign of @entity16 frustration with the pace of reform in @entity5 , vice president @entity26 , in a phone call tuesday with @entity9 , pushed for more progress , according to a @entity14 statement			1
@entity26 urged " that the transition produce immediate , irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the @entity5 people , " according to the @entity14 statement			1
it said the two vice presidents discussed " restraining the @entity37 's conduct by immediately ending the arrests , harassment , beating and detention of journalists , and political and civil society activists , and by allowing freedom of assembly and expression ; immediately rescinding the emergency law ; broadening participation in the national dialogue to include a wide range of opposition members ; and inviting the opposition as a partner in jointly developing a road map and timetable for transition			2
" " these steps , and a clear policy of no reprisals , are what the broad opposition is calling for and what the government is saying it is prepared to accept , " the statement said			0
" vice president @entity26 expressed the belief that the demands of the broad opposition can be met through meaningful negotiations with the government			1
" a senior administration official told @entity1 on condition of not being identified that the @entity5 government was " doing the kinds of things that need to be done , but they have to now deliver and @entity26 outlined some specific things that will demonstrate that they 're delivering			1
" the essential question , according to the official , was whether @entity5 leaders were " truly willing to cede power to somebody else			2
" " are they truly going to deliver change or are they trying to put a veneer on this process and finesse the next few months without actually delivering change ? " the official added			0
" there 's a sense that the government can wait out the protesters			2
but then what ? we 're confident the protesters are not going away			0
" the @entity5 government 's dilemma is " that the longer this goes on , there 's an economic impact that @entity5 ca n't afford , " the official said			2
so far , the @entity3 administration has been careful to call for democratic reforms in @entity5 while also trying to maintain stability in a key @entity106 ally that is a vital @entity108 partner to @entity109 through the @entity110 of 1978			2
with detentions , beatings and harassment of journalists and rights activists continuing , and the weekend comments by @entity9 that signaled a shaky commitment to the reforms offered by @entity11 , @entity13 made a point of directly criticizing both the vice president and the @entity5 government in a briefing with @entity14 reporters			1
" the government has got to stop arresting protesters and journalists , harassment , beatings , detentions of reporters , of activists , of those involved in civil society , " @entity13 said			1
previously , he and other @entity16 officials , including @entity3 and secretary of state @entity134 , called for a halt to the crackdown on journalists and activists without directly saying that the @entity5 government was responsible			1
asked about @entity9 's comment , made in an interview with @entity141 , that @entity5 lacks the necessary " culture of democracy " for the changes demanded by protesters , such as freedom of speech and the right to organize opposition parties , @entity13 said the words went against what was happening on the streets of @entity20 and elsewhere in @entity5			1
" vice president @entity9 made some particularly unhelpful comments about @entity5 not being ready for democracy , " @entity13 said , adding , " i do n't think that in any way squares with what those seeking greater opportunity and freedom think is a timetable for progress			1
" @entity13 also took exception to @entity9 's insistence that foreign elements , including @entity165 , are behind or motivating the protesters in @entity5			1
" i think the rhetoric that we see coming out now that simply says that somehow what you see on tv has been drummed up by foreigners is at great odds with what we know is actually happening , " @entity13 said			0
another senior administration official , speaking with @entity1 on condition of not being identified because of the sensitivity of a rapidly changing political situation in @entity20 , acknowledged that " there is some sort of level of frustration here			0
" " we do n't want just talking , " the official said			0
" we want it to lead to something concrete			0
" while there is no @entity16 timetable of steps being pushed , the official said , " we continue to stress to both sides that negotiations and dialogue have to be inclusive and broad because we do recognize that there 's not just three or four viewpoints ; it encompasses a wide range of views in society ... that need to be fully represented in negotiations and discussions			2
" @entity13 repeated the @entity16 call for an orderly transition in @entity5 from the repressive rule of the past three decades under @entity11 to a multiparty democracy through free and fair elections			1
@entity11 has insisted he will remain in power through the end of his term in september instead of ceding to demands for his immediate ouster by the protesters and opposition figures			0
@entity9 also says @entity11 must remain in power until the next election for the transition to be orderly			0
@entity9 met sunday with some @entity5 opposition figures in preliminary talks that symbolized concession on both sides			1
some opposition figures had rejected any discussions until @entity11 stepped down , while a government statement issued on state tv after sunday 's meeting outlined future steps resulting from the meeting			0
in a brief informal exchange with reporters on monday , @entity3 said : " obviously @entity5 has to negotiate a path and i think they are making progress			0
" @entity13 said tuesday that the talk of reform must be followed by meaningful action , or the protests on the streets would continue			0
" i think that the people that are expressing their desire for greater opportunity and freedom are going to continue to express that desire until the government takes the very concrete steps that i outlined a minute ago to address those concerns , " @entity13 said			2
" and if they do n't , then those protests will , i assume , continue			0
" @entity1 's @entity247 contributed to this story .			0
