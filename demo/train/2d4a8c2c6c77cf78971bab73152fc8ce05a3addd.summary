@entity0 , @entity1 -- celebrating the traditional @entity4 this week , many @entity0 residents spent a lot of money dining out and setting off fireworks to mark the end of the @entity9			1
" for the rich the money they spend is mere peanuts , " says @entity10 , a migrant from rural @entity12 province working as a restaurant waitress			0
are n't @entity1 getting battered with high inflation ? " that 's the ordinary people 's worry , " she said			1
the annual " @entity24 of @entity25 " compiled by the @entity26 noted that last year rising prices topped the list of the public 's concerns			1
the consumer price index , a gauge of inflation , hit 5.1 % last november , despite government pledges to rein it in at just 3 percent			2
now hovering around 5 % , @entity32 may seem manageable , but its food component is around 10 % , with certain items soaring even faster			2
" prices of meat , fish and vegetables have gone way up , " complained @entity35 , a 68 - year - old pensioner shopping at the @entity37 market in @entity0			1
sometimes inflation pinches in disguised ways			0
in local retail stores visited by a @entity48 reporter , prices of some instant noodle brands were unchanged , while the weight of their packages fell from 95g to 85g			0
some residents make ends meet by scrimping , others with black humor			0
jokes circulating on @entity1 - language websites offer suggestions on how to save money in inflationary times			2
" tell disgusting jokes to stop your wife from eating , " says one			0
another , in citing the soaring prices of meat , goes : " my son has graduated with a phd			2
he is considering whether to work for a software company or the pork business			0
" but inflation is no joking matter for @entity1 's @entity74 rulers , as soaring costs could trigger social instability			1
" the @entity74 came into power in 1949 in part due to hyperinflation after @entity82 that broke the back of the @entity1 economy and the @entity86 regime , " says @entity77 , associate professor at @entity78 in @entity0			1
" they know they nearly lost power in 1989 in part due to anger over rising inflation that fueled the @entity94 protests			2
" the @entity1 government has taken measures to curb inflation , from offering more subsidies for farmers to produce more essential goods to imposing price controls on scarce goods and government services			1
in recent months , @entity1 has tapped on the brakes to cool the overheated economy , albeit with limited success			2
some analysts say prompt government measures are mitigating risks to avert a repeat of the @entity112 unrest in 1989 , when @entity0 witnessed massive street protests that ended in a bloody crackdown on june 4			0
" the current 5 % inflation rate is far below the 20 % in may 1989 , " said @entity115 , a political science professor at the @entity116 in the @entity117			0
" prices have been rising continuously in the past several years , so it is not a shock to most people in @entity1			1
" still , some economists say the @entity32 is only one measure of inflation and does not capture the full inflationary pressure in @entity1 's economy today			1
@entity1 's money supply , they say , has expanded by more than 50 % over the past two years -- the stimulus fueling @entity1 's red - hot growth rates			1
with such monetary expansion , the question is n't why @entity1 is battered by inflation , but why @entity1 has n't seen more inflation sooner			1
one explanation : all the new money printed went mainly into an investment boom , not a consumption boom			0
state banks lent out new money , which went to bid up the price of land , the price of commodities -- into so - called " asset inflation			0
" asset inflation , experts say , does not feel like inflation			0
" when the price of bread doubles , it feels like it 's getting harder to make ends meet , " says @entity77 of @entity78			0
" when the price of high - end condos doubles , it feels like smart investors are getting rich -- it feels like a boom			0
" eventually , the asset inflation spills into the general price level			0
" in my view , that 's the real worry in @entity1 -- that what we 're seeing in terms of @entity32 rates could just be the tip of the inflation iceberg , " @entity77 added			1
by incrementally raising interest rates and reserve requirement ratio for banks , @entity1 has slowed down its inflation rate but only modestly			1
ultimately , experts say , what @entity1 needs to do is tighten its money supply , which is still growing at nearly 20 % yearly .			2

" @entity24 of @entity1 's @entity25 " : rising prices topped public 's concerns last year
inflation is no joking matter for @entity1 's @entity74 rulers
soaring costs could trigger social instability , as *history* attests
