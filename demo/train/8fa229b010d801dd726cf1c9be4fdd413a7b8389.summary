-- he predicted it would be an emotional occasion , and so it proved			0
@entity5 could have chosen to bow out from tennis on a grander stage , but the @entity8 was the perfect place for him			1
" i picked this one as my last because in 1999 i beat ( @entity11 's @entity10 , which was my first big victory , my breakthrough			2
so i felt like it was the right moment , the right place to finish it off , " the 33 - year - old told @entity0			1
his first round defeat to fellow @entity19 @entity18 this month brought the curtain down on a stellar career which took him from his war - torn homeland to the international stage , becoming one of the game 's most polished performers , on and off the court			1
" as impressive as his achievements were on the court , @entity5 will also be remembered for the way he carried himself away from the court , " the head of the @entity32 @entity31 said after the former world no. 3 's tearful exit in his adopted home -- a haven for the rich and famous , and a far cry from his birthplace in the former @entity39			1
" a true gentleman and ever popular amongst his peers , we thank @entity5 for his first - rate contributions to the sport throughout his career , and wish him the very best for the future , " @entity31 added of @entity5 , who will now spend more time with his wife and two young kids			1
@entity56 hails ' wonderful friend ' @entity5 @entity5 bagged 10 @entity32 titles during a 14 - year career , his last coming in 2010 at the @entity60 in @entity61 when he beat @entity62 former world no. 1 @entity63 in the final			1
it was a deeply satisfying result for @entity5 who , at the age of 31 , became the oldest first - time winner of an @entity32 masters 1000 title in history			1
but his success was n't limited to individual events			0
together with @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity5 was part of @entity19 's victorious 2005 @entity78 team , becoming the only unseeded country to win the event			1
the dramatic 3 - 2 victory over @entity82 sparked wild celebrations in @entity85 's main square and followed on from a bronze medal he and @entity73 won in the doubles at the @entity88 the previous summer			1
both occasions were proud moments for @entity5 who was forced to flee his home as a 13 - year - old in may 1992 as @entity19 battled to maintain the independence it declared the previous year			1
" i was living in the @entity98 part of @entity99 , so it was n't a pleasant place to be at that moment , " he recalls			2
" i left with my mother and my brother			0
my father stayed , but he managed to get out in november the same year			2
" it was during this time that @entity5 was invited to attend a tennis club in @entity107 , a town near @entity108 in northern @entity109			1
" it was the beginning of my tennis career , " he says			2
" my parents thought it was a good idea , so i left @entity99 in 1993 and stayed for three years and in 1996 i started to have some good results			0
" an appearance in the @entity117 juniors ' final the same year was followed by his first sponsorship deal , marking his arrival in the professional ranks			2
a decade later , @entity5 would reach the pinnacle of his career , rising to third in the world rankings behind @entity56 and @entity125 -- an achievement which remains a tremendous source of pride			1
" i felt like i was no. 1 because at the time it was impossible to get to these guys			0
it is something i am really proud of			0
i felt like the no. 1 of normal people , " he said			0
with their opposing personalities and playing styles , he says @entity56 and @entity125 have created a unique era in tennis which will be difficult for a new generation to repeat			0
" in the past we had a little bit of that with @entity143 and @entity144 but they were both @entity62			0
now we have a @entity147 guy and a @entity149 guy , " @entity5 said			2
and with current no. 1 djokovic " coming from another world at the moment " -- these are great times for tennis , he thinks			0
@entity5 recalls practicing with an 18 - year - old @entity151 back in 2005 and was n't immediately struck by the @entity98 's game technically			1
but what he did observe , even at that young age , was a steely determination			0
" mentally he was ready			0
you could see it when you met him			0
he was so ready to be the best player that you could see it was going to happen , one way or the other , " @entity5 said			2
he predicts the top three will continue to dominate for another couple of seasons but with youngsters like @entity171 's @entity170 , @entity173 's @entity172 and @entity62 @entity174 coming through , a more varied set of grand slam champions looks set to emerge			0
for @entity5 , the labors of the tennis court may now be over , but family responsibilities at his home in @entity181 will more than fill that void			1
" i have two kids now -- a three - and - a - half - year - old boy and a girl who is four months , " he said			1
" we 're going to spend a lot of time together			0
this period before they go to school is special and i want to spend as much time as possible with them			0
