-- sailing the @entity3 on a perfect blue - sky day , @entity2 survivor @entity1 knew this would have been a beautiful moment to share with @entity7			1
she looked down from the deck of the 125 - foot @entity9 to see dozens of playful dolphins swimming alongside the tall - masted sailing ship as it cut through the waves off @entity14			1
as the 26 - year - old held a glass bottle filled with pictures and handwritten notes , @entity1 's eyes moved across the southeast horizon toward a painful spot she knew was about 25 miles away			1
she could n't help but picture what happened there aboard the @entity2 exactly a year ago tuesday			2
the leaking , aging ship sailed into what would become the largest hurricane in generations			1
as the category 1 storm churned about 100 miles off @entity33 , @entity30 's battering winds and towering waves flipped the 180 - foot ship sideways , spilling @entity1 and her shipmates into the water			1
the body of capt. @entity38 , 63 , was never found			2
@entity7 , a 42 - year - old rookie sailor , died after @entity40 rescuers were unable to revive her			1
their deaths and the sinking of perhaps the most famous tall ship in the world spurred an investigation that could still lead to new safety regulations and criminal charges			1
the story of the sinking : life & death on the bounty the bottle in @entity1 's hand contained notes from fellow survivors , past @entity2 crew and loved ones			1
her note to @entity61 read , " i 'm so sorry			2
" " even now , i ca n't really form any words other than those , " @entity1 said friday from aboard the @entity9			2
her voice trembling with emotion , @entity1 said @entity7 's death " was such a huge loss for a lot of people			1
she really , really trusted us			2
" ' a part of me sank with the boat ' drawn by the romance of a freewheeling , seafaring lifestyle , @entity61 hoped to learn the ins and outs of a complicated three - masted square - rigger			1
when they met , @entity7 told @entity1 she 'd always wanted to send off a message in a bottle , to take part in that universal time - honored tradition of the ocean			1
" we were going to do it sometime during the passage , " @entity1 remembered			2
now , so close to the site and after all that happened , a message bottle seemed even more appropriate			1
she thought back to the wailing wind , pelting rain and fear that she and her shipmates experienced in the early morning darkness of october 29 , 2012			2
the disaster set them on an emotional and psychological course that some of them still struggle to correct			1
in the minutes after the tipping ship tossed the crew into the water , @entity1 -- who was tethered to her boyfriend , @entity104 -- felt herself being pulled underwater by her tether line , which had snagged on sinking debris from the ship			1
@entity1 realized she was about to drown			2
that thought triggered a frenzy to fight and free herself from the tether			2
she verged on passing out and even inhaled seawater			2
wriggling out of the tether just in time , she finally broke the surface and sucked in precious gasps of air			0
fourteen of @entity2 's 16 - member crew survived the next grueling hours thanks to gps locator beacons , life rafts and @entity40 rescuers			1
the trauma left @entity1 feeling embarrassed , ashamed , angry and sad			0
since the rescue , @entity1 has been afraid to sail on open water in the high seas			0
it was quite the opposite while growing up			0
with roots in @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , @entity1 had always loved the vastness of the ocean , training for a seafaring career at the prestigious @entity137			0
what happened aboard the @entity2 , she said , has left her damaged : afraid to dive underwater near big ships , fearful of sleeping below deck , especially during rough seas			0
when the fear comes , her heart races			0
reminders of the disaster still come too often			0
" i felt like a part of me sank with the boat			1
a sort of innocence was just gone			0
" overhearing comments about the @entity2 crew being " reckless " or that they 're " loving the attention " made @entity1 mad			0
she said people often do n't understand the lingering emotional trauma brought on by disasters , like when she 's driving and suddenly the tears start welling up , forcing her to pull over			1
they " do n't see the side like when i had to interrupt my job conducting boat tours to go cry in a @entity162			0
" dealing with all this has been hard , @entity1 said			0
" i 've never been that sort of person before			0
" despite her own struggles , @entity1 also wants to somehow transform the tragedy into a force to help others			1
' use your brain and your gut ' one morning in early october on the campus of the @entity174 , @entity1 walked into @entity175			0
the lecture room was packed with about 150 students and faculty			0
" i was so nervous , " @entity1 said			0
" i had no idea what to say			0
" nonetheless , she stood at a small podium and shared her story , offering guidance on how others might save their own lives after abandoning ship			1
she joked about funny things that go through some people 's minds during desperate times			1
for some reason , she thought it was important to bring her car keys with her before the ship sank , and another crew member chose to bring his teddy bear			1
she also talked about how her " training clashed with what i was told " when the crew was instructed to put on their floating emergency immersion suits below deck instead of up top , where the storm raged			0
" what i took from that was , in situations like that , there are no rules except what you think will work best , " she said			0
" sometimes , you just have to use your brain and your gut			0
" the bottom line , she said , quoting a former instructor , is that " all you need is the will to survive			0
" for @entity1 , speaking to the students was " a chance to say thank you and to maybe help someone else			0
because other boats sink all the time , and you lose people at sea			0
" she has grown tired of some of the questions surrounding @entity38 's decision to sail while @entity30 churned			1
they ask , " what were you doing out there ? what was the captain thinking ? " " i tell them , ' i ca n't answer that for myself , and i ca n't answer that for you			1
' " " nobody intentionally puts themselves and their crew at risk , " said academy president @entity237			0
" but once you 've committed to a certain course of action , it 's often impossible to change your mind			1
it turned out to be the wrong choice			0
" the @entity40 and the @entity252 have spent the past year investigating the disaster for possible negligence and safety violations			0
the @entity40 report is under review and could be released at any time			0
it could lead to regulation changes -- and perhaps even a recommendation that criminal charges be forwarded to prosecutors			0
a $ 90 million civil lawsuit filed by @entity7 's parents against the @entity267 's owners is in settlement talks , a family attorney said			1
read more about the lawsuit a return to the high seas this past summer , @entity1 chose to fight to win back the person she was before			0
she needed to confront the high seas			0
" i really wanted to do an ocean passage and kind of conquer that fear , " she said			0
first , she " baby - stepped it " aboard ships that did n't venture too far out to sea			1
now , @entity1 works aboard the @entity9 as it sails from @entity279 to @entity280 , @entity131 , and then to its winter port in the @entity282 , her first real high - seas journey since the sinking			1
the past year has cast doubt on her dream of commanding a teaching vessel that toured young sailors around the world			0
" this was my passion , " she said			2
" i 've lost that , at least for the time being			0
" i can work on tugboats and other stuff , but it 's just not the same			2
" her desire to give back may lead to a new career path as a maritime instructor			0
in various ways , other @entity2 survivors , @entity1 says , are moving forward after the tragedy			2
she and fellow survivor @entity302 seek out books by other adventurers who 've overcome disaster			2
" it 's therapeutic to read other people 's struggles and not feel alone , " @entity1 said			2
most of @entity2 's survivors have returned to the water , gaining spots on other ships , said survivor @entity314			1
he 's between vessels after volunteering aboard a few tall ships in the @entity318 area			1
despite nearly drowning when the @entity2 sank , the 26 - year - old says , he has n't suffered any debilitating trauma			1
" i think about it a lot , " he said , " i might get a little sad , not angry - sad but sad			2
it just makes me want to go out again			0
" most of all , he misses sailing the high seas at night , the waves , a " good squall " and his favorite , climbing up the ship 's rigging			1
@entity267 life jackets found 400 miles from sinking site aboard the @entity9 -- not far from the site where the @entity2 went down last year -- @entity1 held the corked bottle filled with messages to capt. @entity38 and @entity7			1
the bottle , weighted with an iron shackle , is " the only way the message would get to them , " she said			1
symbolically , you might say the bottle also contained the crew 's countless painful struggles and disappointments during a difficult year			1
she let the bottle go			2
it tumbled into the water , beginning a secret journey to a final destination determined by currents and tides -- and life 's other infinite and random forces .			2
