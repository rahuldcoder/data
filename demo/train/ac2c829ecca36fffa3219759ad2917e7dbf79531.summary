-- it 's been an astonishing year for deception and technology			1
a famous author in @entity5 , @entity6 , became even more famous when he was discovered reviewing his own work , positively of course , with fake identities online			2
prominent journalists were found to have plagiarized the work of others fake online reviews were discovered for everything from hotels to @entity16 covers to doctors			2
and i have n't even mentioned the presidential election			2
technology is affecting almost all aspects of human life , and deception , one of humankind 's most fascinating behaviors , is no exception			1
technology is making possible some interesting new forms of deception , like the butler lie , the sock puppet , and the @entity33 water army			1
@entity35 lies are those little deceptions that we tell one another to avoid social interaction			2
examples include the ubiquitous " on my way " when in fact we are not on our way , or " sorry , i just got your text " when actually we just did n't want to respond right away			0
another butler lie is the lost reception explanation ( " i 'm in a tunnel ! " )			1
@entity35 lies help us manage our social attention in an always - on communication world			0
they allow us to use the technology as a sort of social buffer to avoid interaction when we 're technically always available , while at the same time giving plausible excuses to maintain social relationships we care about			1
@entity57 : our buggy moral code sock puppets are individuals who provide reviews or commentary about their own work , usually highly positive , of course			0
the @entity64 allows for this kind of identity deception because people can chose any identity they want			1
but it can come with a cost when false identities are exposed			0
in response to the unmasking of @entity6 , many authors publicly shamed him and pledged to never engage in sock puppetry			0
reviewing one 's own work with a false identity is n't exactly new			0
@entity80 was infamous for doing that well before the @entity64 was invented			0
but the use of identity deception at scale , with thousands of people doing so in concert , is new			1
this is the @entity88 phenomenon			0
the term refers to the large number of @entity33 online writers that are paid a small amount of money to write opinions and reviews			0
in @entity97 this is also commonly referred to as @entity98 , in which an organization mimics a grass - roots movement by paying people to " spontaneously " support their position			1
it would be easy to assume that technology is growing our lying habits			1
but this is n't quite right			0
let 's consider the most important interactions , those with our friends , loved ones , and colleagues			2
does technology make us more or less likely to lie to one another ? surprisingly , a lot of research suggests that internet technology can actually make us more honest			1
in several of our studies , for example , people lied less in e-mail than face to face			1
the place where people lie the most ? the telephone			1
@entity57 : why we make bad decisions we 've also looked at social network sites and the claims people make			2
on @entity133 , where people post @entity135 © information , we found that people lie less about their past responsibilities and skills than in a traditional paper - based resume			1
other work shows that @entity141 profiles reflect people 's actual personality , rather than some idealized version			1
even in online dating , often mocked as a hotbed for lies , we found that yes , people lie , but usually not by that much			1
men lie a little about their height , income and education , and women lie a little about their weight and physical appearance			2
this is n't really that different from meeting someone in a bar , when you think about it			0
why might technology make us more honest with each other ? one reason is that people view themselves as honest and lying violates that self - concept			1
this is especially true when talking to people with whom we have a relationship , like our friends and family , or want to have a relationship , like future employers and dates			1
being perceived as deceptive can seriously harm reputations and relationships , regardless of the medium			2
but perhaps the most important reason is that we are in an incredibly fluid era of human social evolution			0
consider that humans started talking to each other about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago , and over that time around a trillion humans have lived			0
the written word , however , only emerged about 5,000 years ago , and until @entity184 over half the world 's population could n't read or write			0
so , for most of those trillion humans , every word they ever said just disappeared			0
now the average @entity97 records more words in texts and e-mails in a day than most humans did throughout history			0
this obviously has important implications for deception			2
because of our social evolution we 're not wired to automatically remember that our e-mails and texts and blogs and @entity141 chats leave a semi-permanent record			1
just ask any politician caught in a scandal in the last decade			0
@entity57 : the brain in love on the plus side , these records give researchers a chance to study all sorts of social behavior that were mostly invisible before			0
we can use computers to analyze the language in these records and find word patterns that reveal deception , like whether a hotel review was written by someone who actually stayed at the hotel or not ( take a look at the end of the @entity57 talk to see if you can tell which hotel review is fake )			1
we 're in a crucial change state between the era of ephemeral talk and the era of the digital trace , where everything we do and say creates our own personal record			0
deception , whether we want it or not , will no doubt evolve with us as we adapt to this new world of communication			2
the future of lying , like the future of humanity , is wide open			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

in 2012 , deception seemed *rampant* in the news , says @entity240
he says technology enables or abets some new forms of deception
still , studies find that people lie less frequently on @entity133 and @entity141 , he says
@entity240 : people want to be perceived as truthful , especially among friends
