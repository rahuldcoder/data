@entity0 -- as you turn on your hdtv and watch the endless controversy over embryonic stem cell research , ask yourself : should the government spend taxpayer dollars to develop that bulky old cathode - ray television you once owned ? as you install your $ 79 blu - ray player , what if @entity11 was paying millions to develop @entity13 videotapes ? this kind of government waste is what embryonic stem cell researchers are demanding even when science itself , according to scientists such as former nih director @entity19 , has made embryonic stem cell research obsolete			1
yet the @entity23 is appealing a recent federal court ruling that stopped funding of embryonic stem cell research because it was contrary to @entity28 ' 1995 law that decided to spend tax dollars on projects that produce treatments instead of destroyed embryos			1
this is a far - from - baseless ethical concern , as it is tied to the fact that an embryo is a genetically distinct human being from the moment of conception			0
in denying the administration 's request for a stay , the court rightly found , " defendants are incorrect about much of their ' parade of horribles ' that will supposedly result from this court 's preliminary injunction			0
@entity28 has mandated that the public interest is served by preventing taxpayer funding of research that entails the destruction of human embryos			2
" nonetheless , upon being given a short temporary stay by the appeals court while it receives briefs in the case , the @entity54 immediately began spending @entity60 taxpayer dollars like a drunken sailor on 24 - hour shore leave			0
another view : court ruling a blow to @entity60 science human embryonic stem cell research is the $ 10,000 toilet seat of the 21st century			1
years ago , science created a cell that appears to be , in the words of an @entity73 study published last month , " virtually identical " to an embryonic stem cell but is cheaper , promises better compatibility to patients and kills no embryos			1
these new induced pluripotent stem cells ( @entity84 ) " do all the things embryonic stem cells do , " explains the father of human embryonic stem cells @entity80			1
@entity86 's @entity85 agrees that @entity89 technology " is absolutely changing the field			0
" @entity96 " perhaps even eliminate the need for human embryos as a source of stem cells , " says @entity90 of the @entity91			2
@entity97 even caused the man who cloned @entity99 the sheep to abandon cloning three years ago because " changing cells from a patient directly into stem cells has got so much more potential			2
" " the world has changed , " @entity80 told the @entity104 in 2007			0
" human embryo stem cell research will be abandoned by more and more labs			1
" but not by people who put politics over science			0
for some , " virtually identical " is just not enough			0
although all researchers agree or admit @entity84 are a promising development worthy of ongoing research , embryonic stem cell research advocates still want to take millions of taxpayer dollars away from that more promising research to fuel their less promising research			1
with the help of @entity0 politicians , they 're holding taxpayer dollars hostage to the tune of $ 300 million spent and pledged in just over a year			0
perhaps that 's one reason why , during these times of intense economic strain , a new @entity124 poll shows that only 33 percent of @entity60 voters believe that taxpayer money should be spent on embryonic stem cell research			1
talking heads promote embryonic cells by alleging a " potential " for cures , but money is much better spent on @entity84			2
stem cell research that destroys human embryos is also taking money away from successful adult stem cell work , in which no embryos are destroyed			1
found in people already born , adult stem cells are the only cells with a track record of actually and successfully treating patients			1
adult stem cells have grown new corneas and tracheas , restoring sight and speech			2
adult stem cells placed into children have repaired damage from fatal genetic skin diseases			2
as @entity153 reported on august 2 , adult stem cells appear to have the ability to stimulate tissue repair and to suppress the immune system			2
" that gives adult stem cells really a very interesting and potent quality that embryonic stem cells do n't have , " said @entity157 , director of a cellular engineering institute at the @entity159			1
meanwhile , embryonic stem cell researchers have produced no treatments at all			2
their own technology dates back to the @entity167 in today 's pace of science , whereas this year 's prestigious @entity170 for biology recently went to @entity89 pioneer @entity172			0
so , like many failed industries , embryo researchers demand a taxpayer bailout			0
they claim that they 're too big to fail , when in fact they 've never succeeded			0
@entity54 director @entity179 melodramatically announced that the district court 's injunction against his funding of embryonic stem cell research , in spite of the 1995 law against such funding , " poured sand into the engine of discovery			1
" the problem is that @entity179 is wasting taxpayer money on " discovering " the equivalent of the riverboat steam engine			0
advocates for embryo - destructive research respond that the government should fund all research -- if any money is left over after they get theirs			0
but @entity60 taxpayers are not a bottomless grab - bag of cash			0
they should not be forced to waste precious dollars on partisan science , especially when economic ruin fueled by government waste is a looming specter			0
embryonic stem cell research should go into the dinosaur museum where it belongs			1
any funding should be focused on the real , clean promise of @entity84 and on the miracles that are being produced today by adult stem cell treatments			1
embryo destruction has sidetracked good stem cell research long enough			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			0

@entity219 : @entity89 cell is similar to embryonic stem cell but cheaper , kills no embryos
embryo stem cell research taking money away from work with adult stem cells , he says
scientist predicts embryonic stem cell research will be abandoned , @entity219 says
federal funding for embryonic stem cell research *violates* 1995 law , @entity219 says
