-- @entity1 waited until injury time to break @entity4 hearts saturday and give @entity5 a scarcely deserved 1 - 0 victory in @entity7 in a @entity9 clash			1
@entity10 had come close to pulling off a major upset with a series of second half chances until @entity1 found space just outside the penalty area to fire home an unstoppable shot			1
it was his eighth goal in his last seven appearances for @entity5 and could not have been more timely , a second win securing his side a last 16 place with a group match to spare			2
@entity1 had also scored what turned out to be the crucial second goal in @entity5 's 2 - 1 win over @entity29 debutant @entity27 to open its @entity31 2014 campaign			1
before his superb strike , the four - time @entity32 had been kept largely quiet by the dogged defense of the @entity10 , who had drawn with @entity36 in its opener			1
@entity5 dominated possession in the first half , but @entity10 's @entity40 had perhaps the best chance -- however the defender headed over the bar from a corner			1
@entity10 took the upper hand after the break , with @entity47 heading straight at goalkeeper @entity48 in the 53rd minute when he should have scored			0
@entity49 then appeared to have won a penalty soon after when he was brought down in the area by @entity52 , but @entity54 referee @entity53 waved play on			0
@entity49 was denied a goal in the 67th minute when the forward beat @entity52 to a cross , but saw his header tipped over the bar by @entity48			0
@entity47 also had a great opportunity to secure a famous victory with five minutes remaining , but it was @entity48 again to the rescue for @entity5 with another fine save			2
" they made the game very difficult for us , " admitted @entity66 coach @entity65 after his side 's last - gasp victory			0
" @entity1 was marked very tightly , but he showed perseverance , patience , attitude and always looked for the goal			0
" @entity65 's @entity4 counterpart @entity76 also praised @entity1 , but was unimpressed by the referee 's performance in denying his side a second half penalty			2
" @entity1 was fantastic , but the referee was n't , " said the former @entity82 coach			0
" i do n't understand it , he had to have seen it was a penalty			0
he was five meters away , there is no way he could n't have seen it			0
" @entity36 1 - 0 @entity27 later saturday , @entity36 consolidated second spot in @entity9 behind @entity5 with a 1 - 0 win in @entity91 over @entity27 , who are eliminated			1
@entity94 's 29th minute goal secured victory for the @entity36 , who drew with @entity10 in the opening round of matches			1
@entity27 was left to curse its luck , with @entity100 having a goal mistakenly ruled out for offside in the first half , while in stoppage time the @entity105 striker saw his effort strike the post			1
but @entity36 also carried an attacking threat and @entity110 might have added a second only to see his late effort go just wide of the post			0
it was @entity36 's first win at a @entity29 since 1998 and they will face @entity5 in the final group games thursday .			2

@entity5 beats @entity10 1 - 0 for second win in @entity9
@entity1 goal in injury time secures victory
@entity10 has strong penalty claim rejected in second half
@entity36 beats @entity27 1 - 0 in later @entity9 game
