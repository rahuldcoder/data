we go pick each other up or make sure that there 's no case where you have to be alone at night , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity36			0
the @entity3 attorney general , @entity9 , said wednesday that similarities in the attacks lead investigators to believe they may be looking for the same person			1
those similarities include " the age of the victims , the location of the rapes in off - campus housing " and " the fact they occurred during breaks in the school session			2
" in addition , each victim has described her attacker in a similar way			0
investigators are looking for a white man in his twenties of average height and weight			0
he has also been reported to have covered his face during the attacks , @entity9 said			2
the @entity13 sent an e-mail to students monday warning those staying on campus for spring break			1
" if staying in @entity24 , students should take reasonable precautions , as some reported sexual assaults and other crimes have occurred during breaks , " read the warning , which did not refer specifically to the past rapes			2
the @entity13 also posted recommendations on its web site , including checking locks on home and apartment doors , walking in groups and knowing the location of campus emergency buttons			2

the @entity111 has also been working diligently over the past year to make students aware of the rapes , said @entity114 , the center director			2
she has worked with some of the victims and has learned from their accounts that there was often no sign of forced entry			0
this has led her to believe the attacker entered residences during the day , when a lot of students feel safe leaving doors unlocked			0
by emphasizing such details , she said , the center hopes students will keep their doors locked			0
the women 's center and a group called @entity133 have distributed pamphlets at campus buildings as well as several off - campus locations			0
