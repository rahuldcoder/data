-- in the movie " @entity6 , " the year is 1955 when @entity2 introduces the song " @entity4 " to a high school dance			0
that was three years before this tune was actually written , but @entity2 knows it well because he 's from the future			2
it would stand to reason that in real life , time travelers from a future era -- or who had at least visited the future -- might give themselves away by mentioning events that have n't yet occurred			1
they might even do so online			0
i mean , you 'd obviously take to social media to broadcast your foreknowledge of world events , right ? scientists at @entity27 wanted to see if they could catch any such slips by residents of the future			2
so @entity31 , professor of physics , and graduate student @entity33 conducted a whimsical study in hopes of identifying accurate predictions of future events			1
they are presenting their study at the @entity40 on monday			2
the online platform that allowed them to look most comprehensively for prescient posts was @entity44 , because the social network does n't allow back - dating			1
facebook users can alter timestamps on posts , and the popular search engines @entity50 and @entity51 were not as helpful as @entity44 in looking for " prescient information , " the authors found			1
study authors focused on two major search terms they believe will have lasting significance for years to come : @entity56 and @entity57			1
they looked for mentions of these from january 2006 to september 2013			2
before the identification of @entity56 in 2012 , there were no mentions that the researchers could find of this icy space rock			1
similarly , before @entity57 took on his papal name in 2013 , the phrase " @entity57 " did not appear in the researchers ' search results , except for one person 's blog , which appears to have been speculating -- not remembering something from the future			1
it appears that no one posted about his or her neighbor or acquaintance declaring the name @entity57 early , either			1
" it 's not proof , but it 's an indication to me that it 's not possible , " @entity31 said , referring to time travel			1
there are , of course , several reasons why this technique might not detect any time travelers			2
@entity31 and @entity84 may have missed them by using the wrong search terms			0
temporal adventurers might avoid posting to social media altogether , or even using the @entity89 , for fear of being found out			2
or , you know , it might be physically impossible to travel to the past			0
" it 's the largest database ever searched for that kind of information			0
it ( evidence of time travel ) might have been there , " @entity31 said			1
the idea for the study came about in discussions during poker games with his students , he said			0
do n't worry , that 's not all they 're doing ; @entity31 studies other more substantial topics such as gamma - ray bursts , and helped create @entity110 's @entity112 website			0
others have tried in the past to lure time travelers into exposing themselves , @entity31 and @entity84 note in their paper			0
a convention for time travelers was held in may 2005 by then - graduate student @entity119 at @entity121 , but no one living among us from the future showed up , although the event attracted 450 guests , according to @entity127			1
renowned physicist @entity128 , similarly , said in a july 2012 interview that he had thrown a party for time travelers , sending out invitations after the party occurred			0
sadly , no one came			0
similarly , no one answered the study authors ' calls to tweet on or before august 2013 using the hashtags # icanchangethepast2 or # @entity139 , indicating whether the time travelers believed they could alter history			1
@entity142 , a physicist at @entity143 who was not involved in the study , said physicists who have studied the question of time travel into the past -- taking into account @entity151 's theory of general relativity -- have concluded that we can imagine time travel , but it 's probably not possible in real life			1
" we do n't have an airtight proof , but at the very least it would involve manipulating astrophysically significant amounts of matter and energy in unheard - of ways , " he said in an e-mail			0
" and even if you built a ' time machine , ' it would let travelers from the future go back to the moment you built it , but you would n't ever be able to visit any moments before you built it			1
since we do n't think anyone has built one already , i think we 're safe from time travelers for the time being			0
" still , @entity142 said , @entity31 's paper represents a fun , clever idea			0
" to be clear , there was essentially zero reason to believe that they were going to find any evidence for time travelers , but since it did n't exactly cost a lot of money to perform the study i 'm all in favor of it , " @entity142 said			2
so , if you are from the future and reading this , you secret is probably still safe -- for now .			0

new study uses @entity44 to look for predictions of the future
@entity197 found no prescient mentions of @entity56 or @entity57
physicists say time travel is probably not possible
