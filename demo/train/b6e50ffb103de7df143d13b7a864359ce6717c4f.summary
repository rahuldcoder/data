i was sitting in the cockpit of my @entity3 attack helicopter when my division got a desperate call for help			0
it was august 2004 , and i was a part of the 11th @entity8 based in @entity9			1
insurgents were hitting our troops with mortar rounds			0
the @entity8 squad was out of ammunition and could n't shoot back			1
they had just fought a long and fierce battle , supply reinforcements could n't reach them and they did n't even have any green smoke to mark their position for us			1
we took out the enemy target with the last remaining missile on our aircraft			0
several months later , i was talking to a @entity8			2
when he found out i flew @entity30 , he started to recount an experience he had in @entity9 in which a @entity3 shot a missile and saved his squad			1
turned out , it was the same mission ; the missile came from my aircraft			2
he stared at me and said , " @entity37 , you saved my life			0
" did it matter that the one who fired that missile was a woman , or that she was black and gay ? absolutely not ! fast forward almost 10 years to 2013 , and history has been made for women in the military			1
the ban on women in military combat has been lifted , allowing women to apply for jobs in front - line positions and elite commando units			1
opinion : will infantry men accept women as peers ? according to statistics from @entity58 , as of september 2011 , there were 214,098 women serving on active duty in the military			2
while that might sound like a large number , these women make up only 14.6 % of all active - duty service personnel			0
in the @entity67 , women make up just a little more than 6 %			1
the @entity68 says women have been barred from roughly 237,000 positions , and they will now start looking to qualified women to fill these roles			1
the debate the move has raised presents an obvious reality check : our @entity78 community needs to be educated that women are capable of taking on military roles and have done so throughout the nation 's history			1
women have already proven we can handle ourselves on the front lines			0
and in recent times , even with the ban on women in combat in place , women have been pows			1
the @entity93 , the @entity67 all - female search team , is an example of why we ca n't accomplish our front line missions without women			1
the reality of modern warfare is that there are no front lines			0
honestly , i am offended by how many times i hear " women in combat " and " lowering standards " used in the same sentence			1
true , the average man is physically stronger than the average woman			0
standards should not be lowered and women do n't want them to be			2
no one should be in a job where he or she does n't meet the standards -- not every man , for example is fit to be a @entity117			2
news : single mom fought alongside combat troops in @entity121 the argument that women in combat will have a negative impact on unit cohesion and morale is the same argument that was used to keep blacks and gays out of the military			2
at what point do we bring a stop to these ridiculous arguments and address what really matters ? having more women on the battlefield will improve the military 's ability to carry out its mission			1
during my two tours flying helicopters in @entity9 , my unit experienced many dangerous and potentially life - threatening scenarios			0
the ultimate sacrifice was n't meted out by gender			0
for those who are against women serving on the front line , know this : opening up combat roles for women is merely formalizing the reality of what was already happening ; it 's just opening more roles and opportunities			1
the bottom line is if you can do the job , you should be out there doing it , whether you 're a man or a woman			0
the military has been a personal journey for me			0
my grandfather served in @entity167 and was a @entity8			2
my stepdad was a @entity67 and served three tours in @entity170 , and my father retired as a major from the @entity173 after 24 years			2
i love being part of this legacy , and the legacy of service to our great nation			0
it 's time we give women the same opportunity to serve this great country			0
we 're all in this together .			0

@entity185 : in 2004 battle in @entity9 , she saved a @entity8 squad by shooting a missile
she says *rescued* @entity67 did n't care she was a woman . now @entity68 lifting ban
she says women in combat roles does n't lower standards ; they have long served in military
@entity198 : having more women on battlefield will up military 's ability to carry out mission
