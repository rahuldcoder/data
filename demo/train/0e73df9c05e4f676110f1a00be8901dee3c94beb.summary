-- the @entity2 experience with @entity3 is generating commentary that is both prudent and outrageous			1
there have been three cases of @entity3 occurring on @entity2 soil , one ending fatally and the other two now under treatment			1
while health officials provide sober guidance on the deadly disease , several public figures , from high - level politicians to cultural icons , have n't been so even - tempered in their remarks , adding to the public hype that has become associated with the virus			1
here is a sampling of those provocative comments , plus a little myth busting , clarifying and reality checking from @entity3 experts from around the world			1
" if you bring two doctors who happen to have that specialty ( @entity3 ) into a room , one will say , ' no , it will never become airborne , but it could mutate so it would be harder to discover			1
' another doctor will say , ' if it continues to mutate at the rate it 's mutating , and we go from 20,000 infected to 100,000 , the population might allow it to mutate and become airborne , and then it will be a serious problem			1
' i do n't know who is right			2
" -- @entity41 , the chairman of the @entity42 , told @entity0			0
@entity3 is n't transmitted through the air			1
it is transmitted through direct contact by bodily fluids with an @entity3 - infected person showing symptoms of the disease			1
a mutation such as the kind @entity41 describes " would be exceedingly rare " in one epidemic , said @entity52 of @entity53 and @entity54 at the @entity55			1
" it happens over evolutionary time , millions of years , " @entity52 said			0
" this idea that it takes one or two of those mutations and ' @entity62 ! ' you pick up airborne transmission , that is way too simplistic			0
" " if someone has ebola at a cocktail party , they 're contagious and you can catch it from them			1
-- sen. @entity71 , a physician and potential 2016 presidential candidate again , experts say the contact with an infectious person must be tactile , or direct touching , and involve bodily fluids -- blood , sweat , feces , vomit , semen or spit			0
people in @entity85 are avoiding hugs and handshakes because the virus can be spread through the sweat on someone 's hand			2
the uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin of their hand that would allow entry of the virus , @entity0 's dr. @entity92 said			2
but " we all have minor breaks in our skin			0
and there is a possibility that some of the virus can be transmitted that way			0
" @entity71 also made other remarks regarding direct contact : " they say all it takes is direct contact to get this			2
if you listen carefully , they say being three feet from someone is direct contact			0
that 's not what most @entity2 think is direct contact			1
" without directly addressing @entity71 's claims about contact over three feet , @entity122 director dr. @entity121 indicated that 's not a possible mode of transmission for the virus			2
" should you be worried you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone ? " @entity121 said , according to the @entity132			0
" the answer to that is no. " " the most comforting thing that i heard from ( dr. @entity137 , commissioner of the @entity139 @entity138 ) was that water kills the ebola virus			2
i 've never heard that before			0
i thought it was something that was so contagious there was n't much you could do to prevent it or anything else , so her advice was ' wash your hands			0
' " -- @entity139 gov. @entity152 told the @entity153			0
in fact , water alone does not kill @entity3			1
so does chlorine and bleach , experts added .			0

public officials , politician , *celebs* make provocative remarks about @entity3
" this @entity3 epidemic is a form of population control , " @entity166 says
ebola " could solve @entity2 's problems with *atheism* , *homosexuality* , " radio host says
sending @entity2 *troops* to fight @entity3 is plot " to infect the *nation* with @entity3 , " another says
