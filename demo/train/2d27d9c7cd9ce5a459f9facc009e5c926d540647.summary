@entity0 -- national elections in the world 's largest democracy are always a mind - boggling spectacle			1
the @entity7 estimates some 788 million people are eligible to vote in 2014 -- an electorate that 's more than double the population of the @entity11			1
how the country conducts this mammoth exercise every five years never ceases to amaze observers			0
what makes 2014 even more significant is the likelihood of an epic battle between the ruling @entity18 and its allies versus the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) with the controversial @entity22 nationalist @entity23 at its helm			1
the @entity18 has been in power for the past decade under the leadership of the @entity28 - born @entity27 and her son @entity29 , heir to the @entity31 dynasty			1
in an era of coalition politics , the rise of regional leaders and local political parties is also crucial			0
while it 's difficult to predict winners when there are numerous unknowns , here are five factors bound to influence @entity44 voters in 2014			1
1 ) corruption it 's so ingrained in almost every aspect of daily life that most @entity44 have long tolerated and gotten used to small - scale corruption			1
however , after a series of multimillion - and even billion - dollar scams , brought to light by an unrelenting media , the fight against corruption has reached a tipping point in @entity44			1
in @entity0 's recent state assembly polls , the stellar performance by a brand new political party founded on an anti-corruption platform was unprecedented			1
both houses of the @entity44 parliament subsequently passed landmark legislation in december to create an anti-corruption ombudsman with the power to investigate graft at the highest levels			2
how it will be implemented is yet to be determined , but without a doubt , the prevailing anti-corruption sentiment will continue to have major ripples in 2014			0
2 ) youth much is said of @entity44 's untapped and vast youth potential			1
in 2014 , first - time voters will account for almost one - third of the electorate			0
these young adults grew up in an @entity44 reveling in near double - digit growth rates			2
a recent economic downturn is shaking things up politically , although the influence this will have on youth voters remains unclear			2
what moves @entity44 youth to act is unpredictable , as manifested in the stunning outpouring of support for the victim of a vicious gang rape in @entity0 in 2012			1
but increasingly , young people appear to be shedding their indifference to politics , and this crucial voting block can not be ignored in 2014			0
3 ) religious violence in september , @entity44 had the worst case of religious violence since the @entity96 riots in 2002			2
more than 60 people , mostly @entity97 , were killed and tens of thousands displaced along religious lines in @entity100 , a district about 130 kilometers north of @entity0			2
in a country founded on the principles of secularism , there 's growing fear over what the re-emergence of religious tensions could mean for the country 's politics			0
with the rising popularity of the opposition 's candidate for prime minister , the @entity22 hardliner @entity23 , there are concerns he 'll adopt a polarizing strategy to win votes			0
analysts say political tensions could also mount as political groups opposed to @entity23 try to paint him as a radical			0
the long - running election strategy of dividing communities for political gain could be an ongoing political tactic in 2014			0
4 ) inflation @entity44 's economic slide may have bottomed out and growth is conservatively expected to rise to around 6 % in 2014 , but the common man continues to be deeply affected by inflation			1
for most of 2013 , consumer inflation hovered around 10 %			0
the outcome of the recent state elections in which the ruling party suffered a massive blow was partly on account of rising prices			2
the chief of @entity44 's central bank has made taming inflation his top priority , but the impact of recent monetary tightening measures may not be felt in the short term			1
inflation , then , could remain a critical factor in the national elections			0
5 ) rise of states and regional parties @entity44 's economy slowed in 2013 , but one of the main reasons the economy has n't come to a standstill is that growth in several of @entity44 's 28 states continues to rise at unprecedented levels			1
in the once impoverished state of @entity159 , for instance , the economy grew at 14 % in 2012 - 13 , in @entity160 10 % and @entity161 9.14 %			0
these states were never @entity44 's engines for growth			1
economic power translates to political clout , and as the central government is becoming weaker , the states are becoming stronger			0
this shift is so substantial , states and regional parties can now dictate national and international policies			0
how these regional parties fare and which coalitions they choose to join will have a massive influence on the national elections .			2
