@entity0 -- who am i ? i used to think the simplest explanation was black and white			2
but i 've recently discovered that the truth is much more colorful			0
because i 've spent most of my adult life being mistaken for everything but who i am -- @entity12 , @entity11 , mixed african - american and white @entity9 , @entity14 , @entity13 , the list goes on -- the very question has inspired me to embark on a travel adventure back through time in search of answers			1
this is what i know for sure : ethnically , i am a @entity0 born woman of @entity23 parentage			1
i self identify as a @entity25 , @entity23 - @entity9 and @entity25 , interchangeably			1
but racially , through the science of dna testing and tracing my family 's own migration story , i 've begun to receive confirmation of what i 've always believed to be true not only for myself but many of the 47 million - plus latino - americans across the country : the subject of race in our community is kaleidoscopic , more complicated than what the census 2010 checkboxes offer			1
last year , as part of a documentary project i began developing , my father and i took ancestral dna tests			0
our racial background had become somewhat of an urban myth in my family : are we @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , aliens perhaps ? instead of checking off the usual black , white and @entity54 options i 've become way too comfortable with because of my racial ambiguity , i decided it was time to solve my familial puzzle and , at once , break out of the other box			0
i found out through @entity59 , founder of the @entity61 based commercial genetic genealogy company , @entity60 , was that who i am is " the face of miscegenation in the @entity65			2
" and the journey is just beginning			0
my mother 's mother 's mother 's direct maternal line is @entity71 , a subgroup of @entity50 descent , ( we found matches in @entity76 )			0
my father 's maternal ancestry is @entity79 , from an " extremely rare " line of @entity79			0
finally , my father 's paternal lineage is arabic , perhaps @entity83 , entering @entity51 through @entity84			0
with a growing number of @entity86 becoming vested in discovering their ancestral roots -- a @entity89 friend of mine from @entity91 , @entity92 , recently learned she belongs to a @entity94 group that reputedly descends from @entity95 -- the subject of race within our community will enable us to self - identify in ways our parents ' generation could only dream of			2
as our numbers grow to more than 130 million in the next several decades , so will the racial landscape of the nation shift radically			0
one may offer a convincing argument about health care and the economy being more worthwhile issues uniting and affecting all @entity9			1
couple anti-immigration hysteria and a 41 percent spike in hate crimes against @entity86 over the past six years with a troubled economy , and one may find a pressure cooker waiting to explode			0
while the census form is supposed to help show the sociopolitical climate and composition of @entity9 , it only underscores how out of touch its architects truly are			1
from the reintroduction of the offensive term " @entity131 " that will undoubtedly put off many latino - americans , to the failed attempt at engaging the hip - hop generation with a cloying rap commercial , the @entity123 is alienating the very people it 's spending millions of dollars trying to target			2
on the one hand , it 's important for every citizen to be counted because the information collected determines how $ 400 billion dollars of federal funding is allocated to public schools , hospitals , job training centers and more			0
however , the hotly debated question number 9 on the census only serves to prove that even after making history by electing our first @entity50 and white - @entity9 president , our society has only managed to place a " post-racial " band - aid over the subject of race in the @entity9			1
while we collectively continue to ignore the festering wound , i intend on honoring my ancestors on the census form by rejecting the term " @entity131 " and opting to identify my @entity50 , @entity156 and @entity157 roots by filling in the blanks under " some other race			1
" i hope by the time the next census rolls around , we 'll realize the ideal of living in a post-racial society by recognizing that our citizens are more diverse than the flat picture that 's being drawn now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

@entity167 says she identifies as a @entity25 and a @entity23 - @entity9
she says genetic testing confirms her ancestory is a kaleidoscopic mix
she says census form shows that its architects are out of touch
we *'re* more diverse than the one - *dimensional* picture census draws , @entity167 says
