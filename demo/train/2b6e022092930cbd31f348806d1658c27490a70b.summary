-- after the attack on the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , substantial attention was given to the some 40 @entity6 who have traveled to fight for @entity7 in @entity8 during the past several years			1
but much less attention has focused on @entity7 's supporters in the @entity6 who have helped to fund the terrorist group			1
those supporters have funneled tens of thousands of dollars via money transfer businesses to the terrorist organization and have often maintained direct contact with @entity7 leaders and fighters in @entity8			1
after the 9/11 attacks , when it became clear to investigators that @entity22 's deadly assaults on @entity23 and @entity24 had cost as much as $ 500,000 to mount , the @entity6 government became far more aggressive about trying to block funds going to terrorist organizations			1
@entity7 breaks new ground with complex attack part of that process involved a determined effort to sort through which groups were terrorist organizations			1
on 9/11 there were only 26 terrorist groups on the @entity37 's list of designated @entity38			0
today there are 51 , among them @entity7 , which was designated in march 2008			2
the result of that designation was that it was now illegal for a person in the @entity6 to knowingly provide @entity7 with money , training , expertise , false documentation , communications equipment , weapons or explosives , or to join the group			1
opinion : @entity7 is fighting for its survival on that basis , a number of cases have emerged : in @entity60 , @entity57 , two women from @entity8 who had become naturalized @entity6 citizens helped organize funding for @entity7			1
@entity62 , a 64 - year - old adult day care worker , and @entity64 , 35 , set up a dedicated teleconference line to raise funds for @entity7			2
hundreds of interested individuals called in to these teleconferences , and after each one @entity62 and @entity69 recorded pledges of funds from the callers			0
after a teleconference on october 26 , 2008 , the two women received pledges from 21 individuals totaling $ 2,100 in funds for @entity7			2
these teleconferences often featured @entity7 figures			2
in one teleconference , an @entity7 female leader exhorted the listening audience to send funds			0
in another , @entity83 , the head of @entity7 's intelligence wing , told the members of the listening audience that jihad " is waged financially " and that their help was needed			0
the two female @entity7 fund - raisers also went door to door in @entity57 to raise contributions , often under false pretenses claiming contributions were for war orphans in @entity8			0
during a phone call with her @entity7 financial contact , @entity69 stated , " i tell the people to collect money in the name of the poor			2
nobody is aware of the money i send to you			0
" prosecutors said it was clear from the phone conversations that they monitored that the two women knew that they were raising money for @entity7 , a group that had been designated a terrorist organization by the @entity37			1
both women were convicted of providing funds to @entity7 and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms this year			0
opinion : @entity7 's @entity6 allies similarly , @entity116 , a 27 - year - old man , raised money from the @entity57 @entity8 community under the pretense that the money was going to a local mosque or to help orphans in @entity8			1
instead he transferred the funds to fellow conspirators who had traveled from @entity57 to fight in @entity8 to help them buy weapons			0
he and his co-conspirators transferred $ 1,500 to help @entity7			0
@entity116 pleaded guilty last year			0
@entity127 , a 25 - year - old @entity129 woman , who pleaded guilty in december 2011 to sending $ 1,450 to help fund @entity7 , was in telephone contact with some of the @entity8 - @entity6 men fighting in @entity8 for @entity7			1
in 2007 , @entity132 , a @entity7 leader , contacted @entity133 , a cabdriver in @entity129 , asking him to fund his group			2
in january 2008 , @entity132 told @entity133 that he needed to know how much money was being sent monthly to his group , even if it was only $ 100 , because even relatively small amounts of money could make a big difference in @entity8 , which is one of the poorest countries in the world			0
to keep an @entity7 foot soldier in the field only cost a dollar a day			0
at @entity132 's request , @entity133 organized other members of the @entity8 - @entity6 community to help provide funding			2
@entity133 recruited three others members of the @entity8 - @entity6 community and together they sent $ 8,500 to @entity7 between 2007 and 2008			1
all four were later convicted of providing support to @entity7			0
another @entity7 supporter in @entity154 , cabdriver @entity155 , was part of a group of men that sent $ 21,000 to @entity5 and @entity8 for @entity7			2
@entity127 pleaded guilty to giving support to the terrorist group			1
opinion : @entity7 ' @entity163 ' with guns since @entity7 was designated as a terrorist organization , the @entity165 has mounted " @entity172 " to combat @entity7 's support network in the @entity6 and has convicted 12 individuals for providing funds to @entity7 , according to a count by the @entity171			1
this seems to have had a real deterrent effect			0
as a result of the publicity these cases have had in the @entity8 - @entity6 community , indictments for @entity7 fund - raising have slowed considerably			1
and the last time a @entity181 was indicted for raising money for @entity7 was 2011 .			0

@entity184 : @entity7 *bolstered* not only by @entity6 recruits but also by @entity6 financial *backers*
he says the terrorist group has received illegal funding from *sympathizers* in the @entity6
@entity6 authorities have succeeded in prosecuting @entity7 supporters , @entity184 says
