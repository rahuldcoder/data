-- pope @entity1 is expected to meet the archbishop of @entity3 on saturday , the first meeting between the religious leaders since a @entity7 overture to disaffected @entity8 that some commentators compared to a hostile takeover on @entity11			1
@entity12 , the nominal head of the world @entity14 , threw down a theological gauntlet to the pope in a highly challenging speech in @entity18 in the run - up to their meeting			2
he laid out a series of questions suggesting that decades of hard - won apparent reconciliation between the @entity25 and other christian denominations might have weak foundations			0
he also proposed that a truly universal @entity26 church might have to be structured more like the @entity14 -- with no central authority laying down the law -- than like the @entity25 , with the pope on his throne			1
" is there a mechanism in the church that has the clear right to determine for all where the limits of @entity26 identity might be found ? " @entity12 asked			0
" is the integrity of the church ultimately dependent on a single identifiable ministry of unity to which all local ministries are accountable ? " the meeting comes in the wake of a @entity47 move that some say will shatter more than 40 years of efforts to reconcile the @entity7 and @entity14 churches			0
the @entity51 announced in october that it had worked out a way for @entity8 who are dissatisfied with their church to switch allegiance en masse to @entity18			2
the process will enable groups of @entity8 to become @entity7 and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain @entity14 rites , @entity47 officials said			1
the move comes some 450 years after @entity63 broke from @entity18 and created the @entity64 , forerunner of the @entity14			0
the number of @entity8 wishing to join the @entity25 has increased in recent years as the @entity14 has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy , said cardinal @entity69 , the head of the @entity51 's @entity71 , in announcing the move in october			1
@entity12 was said to have been taken by surprise by the move , which critics described as an end run around a long - established @entity7 - @entity14 dialogue			0
" the @entity25 is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the @entity51 from groups of @entity14 clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion , " @entity69 said			1
@entity69 said " hundreds " of @entity8 around the world have expressed their desire to join the @entity25			1
among them are 50 @entity14 bishops , said archbishop @entity92 of the @entity93			0
catholic and @entity14 theology and rites are broadly similar , but @entity8 have long allowed priests to marry and have children			2
in recent decades , the @entity14 has allowed women to become priests			0
the @entity100 , the @entity101 branch of the @entity14 , has ordained an openly gay bishop , @entity102 , and appears to be on the verge of ordaining more			1
those developments have caused controversy within the communion , with more conservative parishes setting up alternative structures of authority			0
pope @entity1 hinted clearly when he last met @entity12 in @entity18 almost exactly three years ago to the day that @entity18 did not look kindly on the @entity14 moves			1
" recent developments , especially concerning the ordained ministry and certain moral teachings , have affected not only internal relations within the @entity14 but also relations between the @entity14 and the @entity25 , " the pope said in november 2006			2
" we believe that these matters , which are presently under discussion within the @entity14 , are of vital importance to the preaching of the gospel in its integrity , and that your current discussions will shape the future of our relations , " he added			0
there are about 77 million @entity8 worldwide , and about 1.1 billion @entity25 .			2

pope @entity1 , @entity14 head to meet , discuss *ideologies*
@entity51 recently opened door to *disillusioned* @entity8 wanting to join @entity25
@entity14 has welcomed ordination of women , openly gay clergy
