-- @entity2 's recent signings of strategic partnerships with the @entity4 and other countries have provided a measure of reassurance to @entity2 about the international community 's sustained engagement in the country beyond 2014 , when the drawdown of @entity13 combat forces will be complete			1
but these documents are short on specifics and do not fully tackle the political , economic and regional challenges that need to be addressed so the @entity2 army and police can take responsibility for the security of the country			0
to give this transition a real chance of succeeding , @entity2 and its partners need to concentrate on the risks and challenges in the critical next two years			0
at the @entity13 summit in @entity28 beginning sunday , the withdrawal timetable of international forces from @entity2 and future commitments to support the @entity2 government and army after the drawdown will be key areas of discussion			1
a user 's guide to the @entity28 @entity13 summit the @entity4 political strategy in @entity2 remains largely focused on talks with the @entity42 , and a chorus of voices inside and outside the government is optimistically making the case that the @entity42 have reformed and can be " reconciled			1
" while there is general consensus among @entity2 that a broad - based and inclusive reconciliation is necessary to end the conflict , key questions remain about the political order that may emerge from such a process			1
this lack of discussion has amplified fears among the @entity2 population of a grand bargain either between the @entity4 and @entity59 or between the @entity2 government and a resurgent @entity42 -- tacitly endorsed by @entity13 countries seeking a face - saving exit -- that could undo the social gains and ethnic pluralism in current @entity2 politics			1
these concerns are already creating fractures in the fragile political balance among @entity2 's various ethnic powers and exacerbating fears of a civil war once the international troops exit			1
@entity13 invites @entity59 to @entity28 summit @entity2 also remain concerned about the 2014 presidential elections , when president @entity75 is due to step down			1
the absence of an " inevitable " candidate and political trust are likely to lead to an enormously challenging electoral environment , rife with legitimate worries about voter fraud			0
to instill confidence in the process , the international community needs to assist @entity2 efforts to ensure credible elections through technical and diplomatic support			0
all @entity2 political actors need to be on board for changes planned in the electoral process			0
this will also be an opportunity to offer any reconcilable @entity42 a chance to be part of the election process			0
the most critical element to securing peace in @entity2 will be convincing @entity59 to close down @entity42 sanctuaries			2
while @entity59 and @entity2 have set up joint mechanisms aimed at establishing more firm control over @entity42 contacts , @entity2 continue to believe that @entity104 's policy gurus will continue to use its control over the @entity42 as bargaining chips in order to retain maximum leverage on reconciliation and the post- 2014 political order in @entity2			1
@entity13 's @entity112 future unclear a jittery @entity113 , incensed by the @entity4 - @entity2 partnership , also has the potential to foment instability			1
@entity117 , the central asian republics , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 are other key regional players that are anxious about the form the post- 2014 political order will take			2
if more is not done to address their concerns , these regional actors may revert to supporting competing factional elements in @entity2 and feed the conflict as they did during its 1990s civil war			0
@entity2 are trying to soften the blow to the economy that will follow the @entity13 drawdown and to move toward sustainability through regional economic cooperation , agricultural development , mining and associated infrastructure improvement			1
while this strategy is necessary for the long - term , @entity2 want to see clear signs that steps are being taken to avoid repeating the lawlessness and violence that followed when @entity146 cut billions of dollars of aid to the @entity149 regime in 1991			0
to bolster confidence in the economy 's sustainability , the international community will need to pace the reduction of aid , work with the @entity2 government to create an enabling environment for foreign investment and support economic projects in the areas of mining , infrastructure and trade			2
it will also have to ensure that the tools for allocating and managing aid money are improved to minimize the possibility that these vital resources will be squandered through corruption and wasteful spending			0
@entity2 -- located in the heart of the most dangerous neighborhood in the world -- still matters , and the security concerns of the @entity4 and the international community will continue to be affected by instability in @entity2 and @entity59			2
the task ahead , in @entity28 and later this summer at a conference on @entity2 in @entity179 , is to focus concretely on how best to restructure and reprioritize international efforts to strengthen the prospects for a successful political , economic and military transition to a sovereign and stable @entity2			2
that will be the real test facing a fatigued international community and concerned @entity2			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 and @entity189 .			0

@entity2 's future will be a focus at the @entity13 summit in @entity28 on sunday
@entity188 and @entity189 : the @entity4 's political strategy involves talks with the @entity42
@entity2 worry about the political order that may emerge , say @entity199 and @entity189
@entity199 and @entity189 : @entity2 are also trying to prepare the economy for @entity13 's drawdown
