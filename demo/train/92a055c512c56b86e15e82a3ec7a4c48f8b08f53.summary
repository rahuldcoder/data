@entity0 -- former vice president @entity2 praised the @entity4 administration sunday for using a drone strike to kill @entity8 - born @entity7 cleric @entity6 , but said president @entity4 should now reverse past criticism of former president @entity11 's actions against suspected terrorists			1
@entity13 -- an @entity8 whose fluency in @entity15 and technology made him one of the top terrorist recruiters in the world -- was killed friday in @entity19 , according to @entity8 and @entity19 government officials			0
the strike also killed @entity22 , an @entity8 of @entity24 origin , and two others who were in the same vehicle as @entity6 , said the @entity8 official , who was briefed by the @entity28			1
@entity22 specialized in computer programming for @entity30 and authored the terror network 's online magazine , @entity31			2
" i think it was a very good strike			0
i think it was justified , " @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity34 on " @entity35			2
" but " i 'm waiting for the administration to go back and correct something they said two years ago when they criticized us for ' overreacting ' to the events of 9/11			2
" the @entity4 administration has " clearly ... moved in the direction of taking robust action when they feel it is justified , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 's daughter , @entity45 , went a step further , saying @entity4 " in effect said that we had walked away from ( @entity8 's ) ideals			2
" " i think he did tremendous damage , " @entity45 said			0
" i think he slandered the nation and i think he owes an apology to the @entity8 people			0
" when asked by @entity34 if @entity2 also wants an apology , the former vice president replied , " well , i would			2
i think that would be not for me , but i think for the @entity11 administration			1
" @entity59 critics of the administration claim it is hypocritical for @entity4 to approve the killing of @entity8 without due process while criticizing @entity11 officials for signing off on the use of so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " such as waterboarding			1
the use of such techniques has been banned by @entity4			0
former rep. @entity70 , @entity71 , told @entity1 that she believes many of @entity4 's critiques of the @entity73 -- most notably its secrecy -- are valid			1
" i do n't think the @entity4 administration should be repeating " those mistakes , @entity76 said			2
" i think the debate about the legal grounds ( for counterterrorism strategy ) should be more in the open , " she said			0
in particular , " we should have a legal framework around our interrogation and detention policies far more than we do now			0
" @entity76 , a former top member of the @entity88 and @entity89 committees , also cautioned about the need for strict guidelines in the use of drone strikes , which have increased under @entity4 's watch			1
critics of drone strikes argue that they undermine the @entity8 cause by killing innocent civilians , infringing on the sovereignty of other nations and generating sympathy for @entity30 and other extremist organizations			1
" we could abuse this program , " @entity76 said			0
" we 've got to have a counter-narrative ( to dissuade potential terrorists )			0
we 've got to live our values			0
" retired gen. @entity107 , a former @entity28 director under @entity11 , largely dismissed @entity76 's warning , telling @entity1 that critics of drone strikes " greatly exaggerate " their collateral damage			1
the strikes are arguably the most critical weapon in the @entity8 arsenal against @entity30 , @entity107 said			1
@entity1 's @entity114 contributed to this report			0
