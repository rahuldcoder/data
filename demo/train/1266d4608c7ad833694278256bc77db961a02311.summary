-- @entity4 ' president has ordered the halt of @entity7 natural gas deliveries to @entity8 via @entity4 , his office told @entity0 tuesday			1
the move comes as @entity7 is decreasing the amount of natural gas it sends to @entity4 over what it says are unpaid debts			1
@entity4 president @entity16 said @entity7 owes @entity4 $ 260 million for the natural gas it transports through the country , state news reported			1
" i have ordered the government to close down the transit of gas via @entity4 until @entity22 pays for it			2
they have n't paid us a penny for this in the past six months			0
this is a cynical and absurd situation when you owe me $ 260 million while i owe you $ 190 million , and you are closing the valve on me , @entity16 said , according to the @entity4 state - run news agency @entity32			2
@entity16 's announcement came after @entity7 president @entity35 ordered energy giant @entity22 to restrict gas supplies to @entity4 because of what he says are unpaid debts			1
@entity39 , head of exports for the company , told reporters that @entity22 would protect its customers			0
" we have prepared a plan of actions should @entity4 violate its transit commitments and encroach on the gas intended for our @entity8 customers			2
we will do everything possible and impossible so that our @entity8 clients would not suffer , " he said			0
energy analysts estimate that @entity7 exports approximately 20 percent of its gas to @entity8 through @entity4			1
the other 80 percent transits through @entity54			0
gas from @entity7 through @entity4 amounts to 6.25 percent of @entity8 's total gas imports			1
officials from the @entity59 are in close contact with @entity7 and @entity4 authorities over the dispute and expect " that the gas flows to the @entity64 will not be affected , " spokeswoman @entity57 told reporters tuesday			2
on tuesday @entity22 reduced the amount of gas it sends to @entity4 by 30 percent , company ceo @entity66 said in televised remarks			1
the company had already decreased its supply by 15 percent monday over a $ 200 - million debt @entity4 has accumulated this year , he said			1
@entity66 has said the cuts will continue daily and be " proportional to the volume of debt			0
" " the letter actually ends with a threat that if the gas deliveries to @entity4 are further reduced , they would take actions to take gas out of the transit pipeline system in order to meet the needs of @entity4 domestic consumers , " @entity22 spokesman @entity77 said			1
" the problem can hardly be resolved in a constructive way when such a tone and threats are being employed			0
" @entity7 's official news agency @entity92 reported earlier tuesday that @entity4 first deputy energy minister @entity93 said that @entity4 plans to settle its total debt by july 5 and pay for @entity7 gas supplied in may by wednesday			1
@entity4 has refused to pay @entity7 gas rates of $ 169 per 1,000 cubic meters for the first quarter of the year and $ 185 for the second quarter , @entity92 reported			1
the former @entity100 republic has instead been paying $ 150 since jan. 1 , ringing up a large debt in the process			0
in the past , other countries including @entity104 , @entity105 , the @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 have complained that their gas supplies have been affected as @entity7 trimmed output to upstream customers like @entity4 and @entity54			2
@entity22 is the world 's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas -- and @entity7 's most powerful company			1
it controls 20 percent of the world 's natural gas reserves and operates the world 's largest gas distribution network covering an area from @entity8 to the @entity124 , according to its website			2
@entity22 exports energy to 32 countries and provides around 25 percent of the @entity64 's gas supplies			0
formed in 1989 to replace the @entity129 of the @entity130 , @entity22 is closely tied to the @entity7 government , which owns a controlling 50 percent stake in the company			0
president @entity35 is a former @entity22 chairman			0
in recent years , an increasingly confident @entity135 has used @entity22 to assert its authority over @entity7 's former sphere of influence by offering heavily subsidized gas to @entity141 countries			0
but that policy has led to disputes as @entity22 has then sought to raise prices			0
@entity22 has switched off gas supplies to another former republic -- @entity54 -- several times in recent years in a row over payments and @entity151 's rejection of proposals to hike rates			0
those disputes ended earlier this year when @entity7 agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to @entity54 , in exchange for permission to extend @entity7 's lease of a major naval base in the @entity163 port of @entity164 , @entity54 , for 25 years			1
@entity0 's @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
