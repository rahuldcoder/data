-- @entity1 is well suited to providing a quick hit of urban thrills and retail therapy , but time - pressed visitors can also get a glimpse of another side of the city away from the shopping malls and neon - lit streets			1
it 's not hard to find things to do or places to go at any time of day or night			1
a trip to @entity15 is a good point from which to begin the day			1
home to some of @entity1 's most expensive properties , it 's also the place for an unbeatable view , smog and weather permitting			1
catch a tram there from next to the tranquil @entity27 -- where early risers practice their tai chi -- or take a cheap taxi ride , which can whisk you there in a few minutes			0
a clear morning will reveal the city 's high - rise buildings and skyscrapers unfurled below , with @entity35 and the green and mountainous @entity36 in the middle distance			1
the pay - to - enter @entity38 will also give you a view of the southern side of @entity43 and the @entity44 , although a short walk round @entity46 is a more rewarding way to take in the city below and work up an appetite			1
@entity1 is a restaurant city and dim sum , which refers to a variety of light dishes like dumplings , is a city staple that can be enjoyed at any time in this 24 - hour city			1
it 's most commonly taken as a mid-morning meal			2
image gallery : @entity1 highlights Â» @entity59 back down towards @entity1 's @entity60 , center of the city 's finance and banking industry that funded the striking skyscrapers			1
the @entity66 on @entity67 is an oak - paneled gem that retains its charm despite its popularity : it 's a fine spot for tea and dim sum			1
for even more local flavor , pull up a plastic stool at a " dai pai dong , " or street restaurant , situated further along @entity67 , for cheap , quick , tasty eats			0
if you 're in the city on sunday , @entity79 's in @entity80 is one of the few places where dim sum is still served by aging trolley dollies			1
flag them down as they trundle past ; point , eat and enjoy			0
you ca n't book a table but it 's worth a visit for the atmosphere and harbor backdrop as much as the food			2
@entity1 is one of the most densely populated places on the planet , but its bustling streets are easy to navigate , helped by the affordable and plentiful taxis and an efficient public transport system			1
the city 's skinny trams are a throwback to a different era and worth jumping on for a short journey just to watch the city go by : consider it a good chance to digest lunch			1
while the city is generally unsentimental when it comes to preserving its old architecture , @entity114 , well within walking distance from @entity60 , can give you a better feel of the city away from the shiny malls and new office buildings			0
from @entity121 , jump on the escalator ( yes , escalator ) all the way up to @entity125 and wind your way back down the hill			0
the dr @entity128 and some incense - burning temples are nestled among the evocative streets , where you 'll also find galleries and independent shops			0
the area is subject to increasing gentrification , so stroll down @entity137 while you still can : its market will soon disappear as part of the area 's redevelopment			1
@entity59 towards the piers to catch the @entity143 to @entity35			0
take one of the vintage green tugs -- as iconic as the city 's skyscrapers -- from @entity148 to @entity149 ( commonly referred to as @entity150 ) on the other side of the harbor			1
as shopping is more of a way of life than a pastime for many @entity157 , you 'll find you 're never far from luxury brand outlets			0
@entity150 offers just as many consumer delights as anywhere in the city			0
away from the air - conditioned glitz of @entity150 's @entity167 shopping plaza , or the boutiques around @entity169 , the streets to the north of @entity164 have a more visceral feel where shopping is no less popular and goes on until late at night , especially at the bargain - paradise for watches and bags , the " ladies night market " on @entity175			0
even if shopping is n't on the agenda it 's a great place for people watching and getting a sense of the energy of the city			2
from the throng to a bit of flash : early evening cocktails at @entity188 or @entity189 bar should revive any weary spirits			0
the swank factor here is high , but there are killer views			0
they are also great vantage points for the lights and laser show that illuminates the skyscrapers on @entity43 every night at 8pm			2
on the island side , @entity200 's balcony is next to the @entity203 building , where you can feel closer to the lights and laser action while enjoying some well - mixed cocktails			0
horse racing , like shopping , is another @entity1 passion and if you 're in town on a wednesday race night , losing a few dollars at @entity216 racetrack is great entertainment , as well as a glimpse into the expat social scene			2
finding a place to eat dinner is never a problem , but for a night on the town head to @entity60 's @entity225 ( here it means @entity226 )			0
@entity227 is the main honey - pot for the bar crowd , but there 's better to be had around @entity231 , @entity232 and -- for extra posing potential -- @entity234 , where the bars and restaurants stay open late , late enough at least until the clubs open their doors			2
