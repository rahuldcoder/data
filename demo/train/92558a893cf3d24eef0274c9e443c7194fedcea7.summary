above @entity4 , @entity5 -- " i feel the need ... the need for speed ! " those infamous words spoken by @entity8 and @entity9 in the movie " @entity11 " enter my head as i walk across the tarmac to the fighter jet that i will soon fly in			1
with my helmet in hand and dressed in a pilot 's jumpsuit , i look the part as i prepare for my maiden flight in @entity5 's latest fighter jet -- the t - 50 jet trainer			1
but i 'm feeling anxious and slightly nauseous , and for good reason			0
the week before , the @entity24 had put me through a rigorous training course at the @entity26 in @entity27			1
but it was n't simply a case of a medical check - up and a few tests to make sure i was fit , healthy and good to fly			1
i was strapped into a simulator and forced to endure extreme gravitational forces for up to 20 seconds -- hardcore training that all fighter pilots must pass			1
i did n't just black out once but twice , so my fear was it would happen again but this time at 24,000 feet in the air			2
@entity39 - @entity38 had heard about my training ordeal			1
the 35 year old has been a fighter pilot for the past 11 years -- fulfilling his childhood dream			2
" there 's nothing to be worried about @entity45			1
just relax -- i will look after you			0
" i 'm not worried about my pilot , i 'm worried about whether i can handle my nerves and nail the near impossible breathing technique that will stop the blood rushing from my head and causing me to lose consciousness once more			0
the pilots at the @entity4 airbase are all exceptionally fit			1
their cardiovascular levels and core muscles are that of an elite athlete			0
they train in the gym every day , push weights and run countless kilometers , conditioning their bodies to endure the paralyzing g - forces ; a force that for us mere mortals feels like a house collapsing on top of you as you gasp for air			1
i get into the back seat of the fighter jet and the ground crew strap me in			1
they point out the ejection seat lever that i will have to pull if something goes wrong			0
" other than that lever , do n't touch any other buttons , " warns one ground crewman			0
by this stage my mask is pumping oxygen and the pilot tells me to slow down my breathing			0
on the ground , in the cockpit i 'm struggling for air -- i know i 'm nervous			2
we soon taxi into position , the engines deafening			0
" @entity93 ? we 're ready to take off , " @entity94 informs me			0
suddenly the roar becomes even louder and we 're speeding along the runway , and within seconds we 're in the air			2
we climb steadily above @entity4 , the sixth largest city in @entity5			0
it gets smaller and smaller until we make our way to 13,000 feet above the clouds			0
there are two other fighter jets traveling with us			2
one is carrying a film crew from the @entity24 , the other is traveling as a buddy -- these jets always fly in tandem			1
after 15 minutes , @entity109 pipes up , " ok enough sight seeing , it 's time to have some fun			2
" this " fun " includes performing an eye - popping list of textbook maneuvers -- b - roll , @entity118 , @entity119 8 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 -- that will test this state - of - the - art aircraft and its nervous passenger to the limit			1
the maneuvers begin and suddenly the pressure hits me			2
it 's so intense as we climb higher and higher , but unlike the training where i was n't wearing an @entity136 suit to protect me from the dynamic forces , this amazing device suddenly kicks to constrict my legs and keep the blood in the top half of my body			1
every time there is a strong g - force this suit blows up and quite literally saves me			1
i 'm seeing stars but i do n't black out			0
i 'm breathing deeply , clenching my body , trying desperately not to let the pain and pressure get on top of me			2
suddenly we 're upside down , with a punishing @entity149 -- six times that of the normal force of gravity -- against me and all i can see is the @entity152 beneath me			2
we come out of the turn and the pilot 's voice comes through on my headset			0
" ready for @entity157 ? i think you can do it			0
" with his reassurance and my renewed confidence i scream through the microphone , " @entity166 ... let 's do it ! " we thrust higher into the heavens and the jet feels likes it 's vertical -- because it is -- and within seconds we 're at 24,000 feet			1
" here we go , " @entity94 suddenly warns			0
and with that the jet twists and turns in ways i never thought were possible			0
i 'm groaning in the backseat , the g - forces at this stage are so painful they feel like they 're crushing my body			1
and then suddenly they release me and the pain is over			0
we 're in the air for an hour -- an hour of my life filled with pain and ecstasy			1
an hour of life i will never forget .			0

@entity6 's @entity45 flies in the @entity24 's latest fighter jet
she completed the *mandatory* training course that tested her body to the limit
the air force pilots have to be exceptionally fit to endure the gravitational stress
the t - 50 flight lasts an hour , with the jet performing mind - bending maneuvers
