-- @entity1 shrugged off his club troubles and a violent challenge to give @entity4 a 1 - 0 win over 10 - man @entity6 in wednesday 's prestige friendly in @entity9			1
the @entity11 striker netted the only goal from close range nine minutes into the second half of the rematch of the @entity17 final at the same venue -- which @entity4 won 3 - 0			1
he was lucky to escape serious injury five minutes before the break when @entity6 midfielder @entity21 was sent off for kicking him in the chest			0
@entity1 has struggled to show his true form in @entity24 since his $ 48 million move in 2009 , but was a constant threat after the red card and should have added more to his new tally of 12 international goals			0
however , his 54th - minute strike proved enough , set up by winger @entity31 's burst down the right and subsequent teasing low cross			0
@entity31 was lucky to stay on the pitch after a bad tackle from behind on @entity6 defender @entity36 , whose new @entity38 club @entity37 will be relieved he escaped injury			0
it was @entity4 's fifth consecutive win under coach @entity42 , who has revived the team 's fortunes after last year 's first - round exit at the @entity17 in @entity46			1
@entity6 coach @entity47 suffered a second successive defeat following november 's loss to @entity50			2

his @entity11 arch - rival @entity60 put the @entity62 side level in the 21st minute after @entity64 's opener in @entity65 , but @entity66 superstar @entity56 gave the @entity67 the spoils with a 90th - minute penalty			1
the duo have matched each other almost goal for goal this season in @entity75 , and @entity56 has the upper hand with @entity66 seven points clear and resounding 5 - 0 victors in the opening " @entity81 " clash between the two clubs			1
and the two - time world player of the year was involved in @entity50 's 14th - minute opener as he cut in from the right in trademark fashion to set up @entity11 winger @entity64			2
but @entity60 , who followed up @entity56 's weekend hat - trick with a double of his own to regain top spot in the @entity91 scoring charts , pounced from close range soon after from striker @entity94 's flick - on			2
@entity60 should have made it 2 - 1 soon after halftime but hit the bar from close range , then saw @entity94 waste an even better opportunity before both were substituted along with @entity101			0
but @entity56 stayed on the pitch until the end , and got his reward when @entity105 fouled substitute @entity106			0
in another rematch of a past @entity17 final , @entity107 were held 1 - 1 at home by 1982 champions @entity111			1
veteran striker @entity112 opened the scoring in the 16th minute after fine build - up play by @entity115 and @entity116 , beating recalled former captain @entity117 in goal			0
but @entity119 -- who shares the surname of 1982 tournament top scorer @entity122 -- snatched a late equalizer for @entity125 's team , beating keeper @entity126 at the second attempt with nine minutes to play			0
world champions @entity24 beat @entity129 1 - 0 in @entity11 thanks to an 86th - minute winner by substitute @entity131			1
striker @entity134 , seeking to move past @entity132 as @entity24 's record scorer , was denied his 45th international goal when he hit the post in the first half			0
the @entity138 , beaten in the @entity17 final in @entity46 last year , defeated @entity140 3 - 1 in @entity141			1
@entity142 volleyed a 28th - minute opener before second - half goals from striker @entity145 -- his 10th goal in six matches -- and @entity148 from the penalty spot made @entity151 's late strike a mere consolation			2
@entity153 came from behind to beat @entity154 2 - 1 in @entity155 , as @entity157 forwards @entity158 and @entity159 struck in each half after @entity162 's early diving header			0
@entity163 suffered a shock 1 - 0 defeat by @entity166 in the @entity167 , as @entity168 netted a last - minute winner and was then sent off after being booked for celebrating			1
the match was reportedly watched by former @entity59 coach @entity171 , who has been linked with the @entity166 post			0
@entity173 , who were also in action at the @entity176 recently , drew 0 - 0 with @entity177			0
@entity178 warmed up for next month 's @entity180 qualifier against @entity181 with a 1 - 0 win away to @entity183 , with substitute @entity184 scoring the only goal in the 75th minute in @entity186			1
@entity46 beat @entity187 2 - 0 thanks to first - half goals from @entity190 and @entity191 , while @entity192 defeated @entity193 3 - 0 and @entity194 edged @entity195 2 - 1 .			2
