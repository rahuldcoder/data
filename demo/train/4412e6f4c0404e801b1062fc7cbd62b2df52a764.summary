fifty years ago , on march 2 , 1965 , a movie based on a successful @entity3 musical premiered in @entity4			1
@entity5 starred as @entity6 , a real - life ex-nun who married an @entity10 naval officer after she became governess to his children			1
the film was , of course , " @entity17 , " the biggest grossing musical of all time , if receipts are adjusted for inflation			1
its core family values , hummable tunes and stunning scenery turned it into a worldwide success			2
it also ensured that @entity29 , with two dozen locations featured in the film , would never be the same again			1
the first tourists asking about the film settings started arriving in 1966 and were faced by bemused locals			2
most @entity10 still have n't seen " @entity17 " and do n't understand what the fuss is about			1
the film ran only for a very short period in the country and was subsequently dropped			2
although many reasons are put forward for its disappearance , the instances of @entity40 complicity depicted in the film were certainly too much to bear for the @entity10 of the 1960s , which was forging a new , democratic future for itself			1
one company , however , knew all about the locations and was happy to oblige			2
@entity50 am @entity49 had provided six @entity52 vans for director @entity53 to transport his 250 stars and staff around for three months during the shooting			2
the company morphed into today 's @entity58 , doing two four - hour " @entity17 " tours a day , every day , all year			1
even on a cold january morning , when i join , there are still 53 people in the tour			2
most are under 35 , about half are @entity64 , but the rest come from all over the world : @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70			2
the tour picks us up from @entity73 where most of the " @entity75 " song was filmed , and proceeds to @entity77 where the lake scenes were shot			1
the palace 's @entity79 was too narrow to film in , so it was meticulously copied and recreated in the @entity82 studios in @entity83 for the waltz scenes			2
then we 're off to the gazebo , used for " @entity86			2
" it was originally sited outside @entity77 but it attracted too many tourists for the business convention center housed there , so in 1989 it was moved to @entity91			2
there are photo ops at the bottom of @entity95 where @entity6 was a novice nun , and outside @entity96 , which served as the exterior of the @entity17 villa			1
the tree - lined avenue leading to the castle is where the @entity17 children dangled from branches , to the horror of their father			1
the final part of the tour takes in the lakes of @entity110 that feature in aerial shots : @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 , in whose village church @entity6 's marriage ceremony was filmed			1
apart from the @entity119 , which are in the new town across the @entity122 river , the pedestrianized @entity118 provides the backdrop for all other scenes			0
amazingly , the fruit market where @entity6 tries to juggle two balls is still in the same spot			0
the @entity129 footbridge over the @entity122 and the steps down from the @entity131 looking down on the town were used to film the children singing " @entity75			0
" fans will also recognize @entity134 as the square draped with @entity40 flags -- a scene director @entity53 fought hard to shoot in the open			0
the @entity138 does indeed take place in the same theater where the von trapp family win first prize at the end of the film , while @entity145 nearby was used as a model for the scene immediately afterward , where the family hides from the @entity149			0
it 's possible to walk inside the @entity152 convent			0
the two dozen @entity155 nuns living there can not be seen , although they can occasionally be heard singing vespers behind a grille around 5 p.m. two new attractions have been added to the " @entity17 " phenomenon since the film 's last big anniversary 40 years ago			1
the original @entity17 villa in the suburb of @entity164 is now a full - fledged hotel			1
the family lived there before they fled to @entity64 in 1938			0
afterward , it became the main residence of @entity171 , the head of the @entity172 , who built the high wall that surrounds it today			0
after the war , the von trapp family sold it to a @entity179 monastic order			0
recently , the last remaining members retreated to a new building nearby and rented the villa to @entity183 and @entity184 , the couple who run the hotel today			0
they explain to me that part of the attraction is to learn about the real @entity190			0
the public spaces are full of family photographs , pictures of @entity6 's wedding and old publicity shots			0
the two @entity197 benches in the hall belonged to captain @entity17 who bought them in @entity200 during the @entity201 in 1900			1
a model ship he constructed is on display in the breakfast room			0
plus , it 's possible to commute to the center of @entity29 , catching the local tram at the end of the garden , from the same stop where the family fled to @entity68 in 1938			1
no , they did n't climb over the mountains like in the film ; that would have taken them to @entity217 , not @entity218			0
finally , for anyone who 's watched " @entity17 " on the big screen , bought the dvd and seen the play , there 's a new medium to tick off			1
the @entity225 in @entity29 now offers a puppet version of the musical			1
managing director @entity228 is proud of her creation			0
although the show has been shortened to one hour and forty minutes , no expense has been spared with its 50 - plus puppets that include five @entity234 , 21 children , seven captains and two @entity237			2
the puppet show can be seen on odd dates all year round , but it 's regularly performed to sell - out audiences three times a week in july and august			2
the show will almost certainly come to those with enough patience , @entity242 tells me			0
the puppets keep touring and have had audiences singing along from @entity250 to @entity251			0
whatever anyone thinks about " @entity17 , " it 's hard to deny that it 's one of the few cinematic experiences that continues to offer cheers in a fractious world			1
for visitors to @entity10 , the hills are still very much alive with it			1
@entity29 is 2 hours and 22 minutes by train from @entity262 ( $ 50 per person one way , oebb.at )			1
@entity264 has an office inside the main train station and also at @entity267 can suggest guides for a city walking tour			0
@entity5 stayed at @entity270 , now @entity271 ( @entity272 5 - 7 ; +43 662 889 770 ) , which has doubles from $ 485			0
the hotel wo n't divulge which room she stayed in , but if they get a specific request , will try to accommodate you there			0
@entity29 ( @entity280 4 ; +43 662 873 557 ) has doubles from $ 820			1
this is where @entity281 stayed and played the piano that can still be seen in the bar today			0
the @entity285 ( @entity286 34 , @entity164 ; +43 662 630 860 ) is a 15 - minute , $ 15 taxi ride from the center of @entity29 , or four stops on the local tram			1
a family suite for four starts from $ 200 in low season			0
private tours are possible via prior reservation			0
@entity296 ( +43 662 883 211 - 0 ) starts from $ 40 per person in low season			0
@entity225 ( @entity272 24 ; +43 662 872 406 ) sells tickets for performances ranging between $ 16 - 40 per person .			1
