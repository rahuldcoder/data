@entity1 while @entity3 announced he would n't run for president on friday , he had personally come to that decision a week prior -- well before he made campaign - style stop in @entity7 , on wednesday that kept the national press scrutinizing his every statement for any hints about his political future			1
he shook hands and took selfies with young voters , attacked @entity15 in a high profile speech , and laid out his thoughts about foreign and domestic policy — all signs that suggested he was gearing up for a third presidential bid			2
but a closer look at the day 's events — and the benefit of hindsight — reveal some clues that @entity3 knew at the time he would n't be throwing his hat in the ring			1
he talked more about the past than the future speaking at @entity32 , @entity3 spent the first half of his speech talking almost entirely about his 2012 campaign when he was the @entity36 nominee			1
many of the light - hearted and funny moments in the speech occurred while @entity3 used self - deprecating humor to describe the last presidential cycle			1
" you may not have heard : i lost , " @entity3 said towards the beginning of his speech			1
he drew a big laugh from the audience when he said a supporter once advised him to stop shaving so he can " grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy			2
" " as if i needed that , " @entity3 continued flatly			1
he lovingly recalled people he met on the campaign trail , labeling some of his most devoted followers in @entity51 and @entity52 " heroes " because they adamantly supported someone they believed in			2
he described the campaign as one of " the most remarkable of my life 's journeys " but spoke with a tone of finality when recalling that it would eventually come to an end			0
" what we knew at the beginning was that win or lose , any acclaim would eventually be forgotten , " he said			0
" as the 1940s song @entity68 used to sing : ' fame if you win it , comes and goes in a minute			0
' " granted , it 's a line he has used in previous speeches , but it 's an example of how he was in a reflective mood			0
he declined to answer a question from the moderator about how he would run a potential campaign differently from 2012 — " that 's another question i wo n't answer " — and went on to talk about how @entity36 should do better at having a " clear and compelling message , " especially when talking to nontraditional @entity36 voters , like minorities and young people			1
he even suggested that @entity36 have " to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election			0
" that 's pretty bold — if not daring — talk for a potential candidate			0
@entity95 , for example , got hammered in the conservative media for making a similar suggestion back in december			0
@entity3 appeared to sound more like he was angling to become a kingmaker than a candidate			1
he continually referred to a need for " strong leaders " and " leadership " but did n't narrow down his remarks to talk rhetorically about a single leader			2
his policy ideas were vague it was on that very topic — minority outreach — that political observers were most closely trying to examine @entity3 's recent statements and comments			1
he won only 6 % of the @entity113 vote and 27 % of the @entity115 vote in 2012			0
speaking to the @entity116 earlier this month , @entity3 suggested the party needed to focus more on anti-poverty policies , and in his speech on wednesday he laid out some of his ideas for tackling the issue			1
but his ideas were vague and lacked the kind of depth that would churn more interest in a potential campaign			0
he argued that the government , for example , was providing incentives for single mothers to stay on federal assistance and avoid marriage because they could lose their benefits once they became married			0
" if marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty , then we want to do the opposite , " he said			0
" we want to create incentives for them to get married , not to not get married			0
" he also said k - 12 education needs to improve , and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who have n't worked before , but did n't outline specifics			2
those come nowhere near close to some of the more serious proposals by his former running mate , rep. @entity144 , or by gov. @entity145 and sen. @entity146 -- who have made efforts to address poverty through criminal justice reform			1
mystery and pulled pork @entity3 was noticeably more relaxed , not only in his speech , but at a barbecue joint he stopped at earlier in the day to meet with voters			1
he joked with the national reporters following him in the cramped space that there 's an " unwritten rule " that politicians should n't be photographed while eating			2
but he continued to eat anyway			0
" do you still consider yourself a politician , then ? " one reporter asked , to which @entity3 replied : " you 're taking my picture			1
what can i say ? " another asked if this is " the new @entity3 , " noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras			1
" i did n't know i had a choice , " he shot back , drawing some laughs			2
a conversation @entity3 had with @entity32 football coach @entity172 at the table also seemed to provide a window into perhaps some bitter feelings @entity3 still has about coverage from 2012			1
in politics , @entity3 argued , there 's too much emphasis on what a person says , rather than what a person does			1
" it 'd be nice if people who run for office , that their leadership experience and what they 've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on , but it 's not , " he said			2
" it 's mostly what you say			0
" what you do , @entity3 told @entity172 , " is a lot more important that what you say , " noting how a football coach 's reputation is almost entirely based on his record			1
" you could be the sweetest talking person in the world , but unless you got a record , you 're in trouble , " he said			0
still , he was doing a meet - and - greet — in his jeans and a plaid shirt like he used to — and anyone watching him could have walked away thinking this was a " go			0
" the mystery of his barbecue outing -- the will he or wo n't he -- was perfectly captured in a response @entity3 gave to one man who urged him to run again			1
" you 're very kind , " @entity3 replied , patting the man on the arm			2
" i wish i were there right now , i got ta tell ya			0
" @entity2 's @entity218 contributed to this report .			0
