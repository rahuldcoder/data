@entity0 -- when the @entity5 business community talks about the incredible bounce back of @entity5 's supply chain , the name @entity3 is usually on the tip of their tongues			1
their factory in the city of @entity14 is humming with life today , showing little signs of the devastation it suffered following the earthquake and tsunami a year ago			1
the remarkable part of @entity3 ' success story is not that it was achieved , but that the full recovery of its plant happened months ahead of schedule			1
" i was wondering if this sterile room or this factory would ever be the same again , " said @entity27 general manager @entity26 , pointing out the immaculate , sterilized production floor where the company 's microchips are manufactured			1
@entity26 was at the plant when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck on march 11 , creating a force so powerful that he was thrown across a room with the furniture			0
ceilings caved in , computers cracked and critical air filters were jammed with dust -- @entity3 ' computer chips rely on sterile , dust - free conditions for production			1
@entity26 was looking at a clean - up operation unprecedented in the firm 's history			2
the worldwide auto industry was also looking at an unprecedented problem because of the damage to this one plant			1
when 70 % of all drivers in the world start their cars , the microchip inside the vehicle 's computer whirls to life			1
this computer chip is essential to the car 's functionality , though most vehicle owners have no idea of its existence or that it traces back to @entity3			1
drivers may still not know the name @entity3 , but automakers got a jarring lesson in the importance of the company 's role in the car parts supply chain			1
the auto industry began to raise the alarm shortly after the earthquake -- production lines around the globe could grind to a halt without a rapid recovery at @entity3			1
the company , with its highly specialized technology , had forged a relationship with so many car manufacturers that the bulk of the industry relied on its microchip			2
new auto sales plummeted 37 % after disaster " you have people outside of @entity5 who relied on most of components outside of @entity5 to not source from other countries			2
thinking before , @entity5 would have been a very reliable source			0
now understanding that it 's not the case , even for @entity5 , " said @entity95 , a council member on national strategy and policy for @entity5 's government			0
automakers like @entity102 say they learned that lesson and have diversified their supply chain			0
what that means for companies like @entity3 is the company is looking at more competition and a demand for reductions from its buyers			2
@entity3 ' president , @entity115 , said the lessons of the supply chain break is another hurdle for @entity5 companies , which already face economic headwinds of the strong yen and high production costs in @entity5			2
but he believes his company can survive and even thrive amid the global economic pressure			0
" i really believe it 's part of our company 's power , " he said			0
@entity129 points to the remarkable weeks after the quake			0
thousands of workers descended on the @entity14 factory , working without electricity or running water in sub zero , winter weather			1
half of the people working on rebuilding the company were volunteers from @entity3 ' customers and partners			2
" they never complained , " recalled plant manager @entity26 , who still gets emotional thinking about the massive effort			0
he said the workers and volunteers organized themselves and even found ways to find water and food on their own , while focusing on getting the company back to pre-quake status			0
he admits his company is facing new pressures and will have to deal with them , despite the fact that the @entity14 factory is a shining example of the supply chain 's rebound			1
but he believes his company can do it			0
@entity26 then paused and looked out at the sterile production room , busy with the massive orders from his customers around the world			0
he has recent history as proof of what determination can do .			0

@entity3 , which makes microchips , suffered huge *amount* of damage
auto industry was also looking at an unprecedented problem because of the damage to this one plant
when 70 % of all drivers in the world start their cars , the microchip inside vehicle 's computer whirls to life
thousands of workers descended on the @entity14 factory in the *aftermath* to clean up plant
