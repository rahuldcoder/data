-- if the first presidential debate in @entity2 was a game changer , tuesday night 's was not			1
but that does n't mean it was n't a spirited , heavyweight bout with several consequential moments			0
president @entity8 entered the second presidential debate needing to make up serious ground after his first debate performance			1
he turned around the narrative from the first debate -- that he was listless and lethargic and on the defensive -- but showing up is one thing , winning is another			0
@entity8 needed a convincing win tuesday night , and he did not get it			1
gov. @entity18 came into tuesday night 's debate needing to prove that his first performance was n't a fluke -- in other words , that he was n't @entity23 in the @entity25 debates , when @entity25 won early on but went on to get dominated by a @entity25 comeback			1
tuesday night @entity18 delivered again and proved his performance was consistent and legitimate			2
he has established himself as a legitimate alternative to the president			2
@entity18 was relaxed and not intimidated by @entity8 's newfound aggressiveness			1
he was responsive and flexible			0
he went toe to toe early on , challenging the president directly over the production of oil on government land and winning on the facts			0
reality check : oil production one of the highlights of @entity18 's night was when he spoke directly to the @entity43 - @entity42 man who voted for @entity8 in 2008 , but wondered whether the next four years would be any different if @entity8 were re-elected			1
in an encyclopedic fashion , @entity18 gave a litany of @entity8 's failed promises and failed record			1
@entity18 was at his best when he told the voters in the room to look at the president 's record and policies , rather than listening to his rhetoric , and then proceeded to explain the impact of the @entity8 policies and what he would do differently			1
in what may be one of the more important political moments of the debate , @entity18 was asked how he would be different from @entity62			2
@entity18 effectively distanced himself from @entity62 on policy specifics , noting he would control deficit spending and champion small business , not just big business			0
it was an important moment to convince many undecided voters that he is not @entity62 2.0			0
from the first whistle , @entity8 was stronger , more forceful , and more aggressive , no doubt to the delight of his supporters			0
if @entity8 landed punches it was because he threw a lot of them -- mainly on @entity18 's private equity career and tax returns			1
but too often his attacks seemed rehearsed and scripted			0
@entity18 's empty ' binders full of women ' furthermore , @entity8 spent more time attacking @entity18 than focusing on his own vision for the future			1
@entity8 did n't lay out a new , bold , or different plan for a second term dealing with the debt or entitlements			2
@entity18 was looking to the future ; @entity8 was trying to remind the country of the @entity62 years and tie @entity18 to @entity62			1
if there was a key takeaway from the debate indicative of the race going forward , it may be the heated exchange over @entity95 and the president 's handling of the attack on our ambassador			2
the president was directly asked about the security in @entity103 and who declined the requests for more security in @entity95			0
@entity8 did n't answer the question			2
@entity18 could have called him on it and missed a big opportunity			0
then there was the most controversial moment of the night , when moderator @entity112 intervened to insert that @entity8 did in fact call the attacks that killed ambassador @entity116 " terror " attacks in his @entity119 speech the next day			0
@entity8 actually said , " no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character , or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for			0
" there will be much parsing and spinning of these words , but @entity18 should n't have let @entity112 interrupt him and assert her own interpretation			2
fact check : @entity8 's statement on " acts of terror " for two weeks after the president 's @entity119 speech , @entity8 and his administration peddled the explanation of a spontaneous protest sparked by a @entity142 video , before they finally called the @entity103 attack what it really was -- a terrorist attack			1
@entity18 should have emphasized this mishandling			0
he may have missed this moment , but he will have another chance during next week 's foreign policy debate			0
until now , the momentum of this race has been about impressions and appearance -- @entity18 's aggressiveness and forcefulness in the first debate versus @entity8 's listlessness and lethargy			1
in tuesday night 's debate , @entity8 gets points for showing up , but that 's hardly something for the @entity164 to be proud of			2
the impression @entity18 made in the first debate he reaffirmed tuesday night , meaning that @entity8 has still has ground to make up going into the final debate next week			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity171 : @entity2 debate was a game changer ; @entity176 one was n't
he says the president needed to score a convincing win but fell short of that
@entity171 : @entity8 was more *energetic* , but @entity18 showed he 's a *credible* alternative
