-- what did you do this weekend ? this seemingly innocuous question from a co-worker makes @entity5 uncomfortable and anxious			2
he lies or avoids answering the question altogether			2
@entity5 is gay , and in the closet			1
he has worked at the same place for 27 years , specializing in highway construction , and while he knows that some of his colleagues suspect he is gay , he has never revealed his sexuality at the office			1
" i could n't come out in the ' 80s because it was openly hostile , " he said			2
" i 've thought about coming out			2
the environment has changed , but my decision has n't			2
if i came out , i would be the only one			2
" though he knows of other homosexuals in his 4,000 - employee work force , he says no one is openly gay			1
" it 's a problem			2
i 'm somewhat used to it , " said the civil engineer , 53 , explaining he " filters " what he tells people about his personal life			1
" when people ask about who i went on vacation with , i tell them , ' a friend			2
' " safe to come out ? fear is also what drove @entity34 , a 25 - year - old information technology professional , into the closet			1
@entity34 works at a major corporation in one of the 29 states where private companies can legally fire , or not hire , someone because she or he is gay			1
" there is no protection , " said the gay rights activist , conceding that there is some hypocrisy in campaigning for gay rights while concealing his homosexuality			1
he refrains from answering his partner 's telephone calls or talking about him at the office , he said , even going through the trouble of creating two albums of vacation photos , one with his partner and one that excludes his partner to show people at work			1
" you 're at - will employment			2
so they could point blank say i do n't want a gay person working under me			1
i 'm going to let you go			2
i 'm not saying that my managers would do that , but you never know			2
" such fears appear to be echoed by others in the lgbt community , where according to a recent study by the @entity74 , an @entity72 advocacy group , 53 % of @entity72 workers in the country hide their sexual identity at work and 35 % feel compelled to lie about their personal lives while at the office			1
another joint study by @entity83 , a consulting and financial services firm , and @entity86 , found that 83 % of lesbian , gay and bisexual workers reported " covering " a part of their sexual identity at work			1
" it 's really downplaying the parts of ourselves that are either our identity or our experiences , " said @entity94 , managing principal of the @entity95 and one of the authors of the study			1
" the lgbt community is the population that is most impacted by this concept of covering , hiding their identity when they come to work			1
they 're completely denying , if you will , their sexual identity in order to conform			2
" of course , there are also @entity72 individuals who are not out of the closet because they feel their sexuality is private and does n't need to be discussed at work			1
@entity120 ceo @entity119 publicly acknowledged thursday that he is gay , becoming the only ceo of a @entity122 company to announce his homosexuality while at the helm of a major company			1
" i do n't consider myself an activist , but i realize how much i 've benefited from the sacrifice of others , " @entity119 wrote in a @entity127 column			2
" so if hearing that the ceo of @entity120 is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is , or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone , or inspire people to insist on their equality , then it 's worth the trade - off with my own privacy			1
" @entity119 's announcement triggered @entity146 users to make # proudtobegay a trending topic for several hours			0
many people used their 140 characters to celebrate the news , and some saw it as an important moment			0
" proud of @entity119 for using his voice and his influence to help others , " tennis legend and openly gay athlete @entity158 wrote			1
" so proud of tim cook			0
knowing the apple ceo is gay will comfort and inspire so many young people who are afraid			1
maybe it already has , " tweeted @entity164 reporter @entity163			0
the news comes a month after president @entity168 's executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation , which was welcomed by the @entity72 community			0
the presidential initiative helps to reinforce a changing social and legal landscape where , according to the @entity74 , 91 % of @entity122 companies have policies that promote diversity and protect employees against discrimination			1
inclusion good for business making policy translate to culture is an evolving challenge , says @entity186 , a former investment banker who founded @entity187 , a strategic advising company geared toward helping companies focus on @entity72 inclusion			1
" we have become so politically correct that a number of senior leaders are afraid to say anything because they do n't want to say the wrong thing , " @entity186 said			0
" but , point in fact , that is the exact wrong thing to do			0
what i encourage senior leaders to do is say , ' i am learning			0
can you help me ? i am going to make a mistake ; i want you to help me figure out that i should say sexual orientation not sexual preference			0
' " @entity205 says he is encouraged by the strides he sees companies taking			1
" i actually think corporate @entity211 is faster than the federal government , than any state governments , because corporate @entity211 sees the business bottom line impact of this , " he said , noting that the @entity72 market represents about $ 800 billion in spending power			0
" it 's not just the @entity72 market ; it is the ally market			0
it 's the people who care about @entity72 people , " said @entity186			0
" there are economic consequences to discrimination , and you see that play out in the marketplace			0
" key to increasing inclusion at the office , @entity205 says , is retaining talent			0
" it definitely is a deciding factor where i go next			0
it definitely weighs in on my decision to stay			0
i mean , just knowing that you have the security and those protections built in is really important , " @entity34 said			1
" regardless of who i am outside of work or who i identify as sexually , i 've worked to always prove myself as a valuable employee and member of the team			2
" inclusive policies are not enough to persuade @entity244 to come out at his job , where he is a project manager for a medical research firm			1
" policy does n't necessarily create safety , " said @entity244 , a transgender man			1
the 33 - year - old leads a team of 10 associates and recently opted to work from home , in part because he found it too stressful to go to an office for fear that he would be outed			2
" the main reason is i do n't know whether there would be a negative effect , " he reasoned			0
" i ca n't risk that			0
it feels too much like a roll of the dice			0
" ' i 'm not ashamed of who i am ' @entity244 's employment came after an exhaustive nine - month search that included interviews with 20 different companies			1
in every interview except with his current company he was open about his transition from female to male			0
" it 's better to not be out , " said @entity244 , who is convinced that being open about his transgender identity and activism may have turned off potential employers			1
@entity244 's concern was backed by a 2011 @entity282 study that found in some states , there was significant discrimination against openly gay applicants , with gay job applicants approximately 40 % less likely to be offered a job interview than their heterosexual counterparts			1
@entity244 has been with his company for six years , and at this point he 's not ready to tell his co-workers that he is transgender			1
that often leaves him feeling lonely and isolated at work			2
" i may be perceived as a strange ' other			0
' that 's sad and hurtful , " he said			0
" it 's such a huge risk			0
if i come out , i ca n't go back			0
it 's a one - way door			0
" still , it 's a door that @entity244 may soon walk through , as his yearning to become a parent is greater than his fear of being outed			1
@entity244 , who was born a woman , is considering having a child			1
a pregnancy would force @entity244 out of the closet , as he still routinely meets with his team			1
" it 's not about shame			0
i 'm not ashamed of who i am			0
it 's more about logistically navigating a world that i know to be untrustworthy , and even with policy in place , it 's fickle			0
" life decisions like marriage could prompt @entity34 to come out , too , but until then he hopes that policy at work will change to reflect the growing social culture of acceptance			1
" maybe i 'll be the first			0
we 'll see if the time is right and the venue is right			0
i mean someone has to step up eventually			0
... the tides are slowly turning in our favor			0
" @entity0 's @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this story .			0
