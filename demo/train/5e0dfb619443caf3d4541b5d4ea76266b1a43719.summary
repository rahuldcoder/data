@entity0 -- retirement terrifies sports stars			1
the end of a glittering career can feel like falling off a cliff to an athlete who thrives on fame and fortune			2
and the longer the career , the harder the end game seems to be			2
for living legends , it 's especially tough to know how to quit			2
world heavyweight champion @entity14 turned 50 this year -- but he still wants to box professionally			1
" i 'm not retired , " he says			1
" if i can get a championship fight , i will			2
" he wo n't fight just anyone , though -- only top boxers			1
because he holds five heavyweight titles , he tells @entity1 that young boxers could want to challenge him just because they have something to prove			1
@entity14 can still draw a crowd , nearly 30 years after his professional debut			1
during a recent visit to @entity25 in @entity0 , fans swarmed him , taking pictures and shaking his hand			2
@entity14 : i want to be a heavyweight champion again " i keep myself right at the ( professional ) level , in case somebody feels froggy and says , ' i think i 'm going to whup the old man , ' " he says			1
" and they 'd be shocked			2
" he says he trains every day , so that he always feels ready to fight at the top level			2
but @entity14 also faces a fight outside the ring : he lost his @entity0 - area mansion to foreclosure in 2012			1
so he understands the perils of quickly rising from modest means to riches -- then back again			2
he is trying to get his financial house in order			2
he recently took a sales role with @entity46 , a financial services company			0
@entity14 sees it as an opportunity to teach others how to manage money			1
" when i was 21 years old , i was a millionaire , " he says			0
" you 're talking about a guy making $ 8,000 a year , working 40 hours a week , made the @entity54 team , went to the @entity54 , two weeks later -- a millionaire			0
" when @entity14 signed his first million - dollar contract three decades ago , he had been working three jobs that together earned him less than $ 10,000			1
" it was just all of a sudden , " he says			0
" i came into boxing , i made big money			1
" but getting used to big swings in the bank account is n't the only challenge celebrity athletes such as @entity14 face			1
they also have to learn how to live without the constant cheer of the crowds once they 're out of the spotlight			0
@entity1 profiles : @entity70 's ' giant steps ' @entity70 , 65 , was one of the world 's most famous basketball players			1
he remains the record all - time scorer in the @entity75			1
he still has to duck to get his 7 - foot , 2 - inch frame through most doorways			0
but when he retired as a player in 1989 , after 20 years of professional play , he was at a loss			1
he told @entity1 : " the first training camp that i missed , i was like , ' jeez , what am i going to do now ? ' " he quotes another sports legend -- @entity85 -- to describe how he felt when he retired			1
" he said that athletes die twice , " @entity70 said			1
" you know , when that first career is gone , that 's a death			0
" that adjustment was harder for @entity70 to process than his cancer diagnosis in 2008			1
he has chronic myeloid leukemia , a blood cancer that he manages with drug therapy			1
" i think that ( retirement ) was the more difficult adjustment because you do n't know what to do , " he said			1
" i 'd had this incredible career			0
" but when he started to cultivate his talents off the court , he discovered a new calling			0
now , he says , he wants to be known for his writing -- not just his basketball prowess			2
faster , stronger , longer : olympians live longer than the rest of us " i always tell people i can stuff a basketball into a hoop , but i also have a mind , " he said			2
he has written seven books , including one for children , that focus on contributions from african - americans to @entity117 culture			0
inspiring young people to pursue paths in science , math , engineering and other disciplines beyond professional sports is a passion			0
because of his reputation as a famous athlete , his advice resonates with young fans			0
" it 's really important that young people get ... that there 's more to their life than sports and entertainment , " he said			0
@entity70 also works as a paid spokesman for @entity137 , which makes @entity138 , the drug therapy he takes to manage his cml			1
he says this role exposes him to a new fan base			0

" he said the experience has opened up a new world to him			0
sports psychologist @entity153 says that very few professional athletes want to think about coming to the end of their careers while they 're still playing			0
" as a consequence , very few of them are prepared for that next chapter			0
" finding a passion off the court while she was still playing in major tournaments helped @entity164			1
the tennis superstar , now 55 , played professionally well into her 40s			0
she said that after retiring , " you become irrelevant really quickly			0
" but because she never defined herself solely through tennis , she was able to accept the transition			0
" my sense of self - worth did not depend on winning matches , " she said			0
@entity164 still is committed to keeping fit : she runs with her dogs , skis , cycles and plays hockey			1
" and of course , i play tennis			0
" @entity164 serves as fitness ambassador for @entity181 , which she says she loves			1
and she wrote " @entity182 : my @entity183 and @entity184 to achieve the @entity185			0
" her advice to other athletes , professional and amateur ? play a new game when you get older			0
" find another sport that you can really improve at , that you can get excited about , and have fun , " she said			0
athletes can still satisfy their competitive drive , without comparing their current game to how they used to perform when they were younger			0
