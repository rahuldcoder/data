-- in the heat of battle , it 's best to have your key allies closest to you and @entity9 @entity8 captain @entity7 has certainly done that by naming two close friends as his vice-captains			1
his decision was eased by knowing that both @entity15 and @entity16 have previously played major roles in leading @entity9 to victory			1
the @entity19 now hopes they can do the same when the @entity9 seek to defend the trophy at @entity22 in @entity23 in september			2
@entity7 's compatriot @entity16 was one of @entity25 's vice captains in 2006 when @entity9 recorded their largest home victory -- by 18½ points to 9½ -- at the @entity28 in @entity29			1
@entity15 , meanwhile , was an unforgettable skipper as he inspired @entity9 to a 15½ - 12½ victory at @entity31 in @entity32 in 2002			2
neither the @entity33 nor @entity7 will ever forget the success since it was the @entity19 himself who sunk the winning putt on his @entity8 debut			0
" @entity7 was a special part of my team at @entity31 in 2002 and he knows i will do everything possible to help him and the team at @entity22 , " @entity15 , 60 , said in a statement			1
" everyone knows how much the @entity8 has meant to me over my career so i am absolutely delighted to be involved once again			0
" a veteran of 11 @entity46 , @entity15 has won the competition three times -- twice as a player and once as a captain			2
@entity16 , 61 , is a relative newcomer by comparison , having lost both competitions he contested as a player in 1979 and 1981 prior to the stunning turnaround in fortunes when vice captain eight years ago			2
however , he does have the advantage of having known @entity7 , now 47 , since the @entity19 was a teenager			0
" as well as being good friends , ( @entity16 and @entity15 ) are two guys i greatly admire both personally and professionally and i know they will be vital assets to me in @entity23 , " @entity7 said			1
" they were the first two people i had in mind for this role when i was appointed captain and , since then , i have talked to a lot of the experienced @entity9 players about having them as part of the team and , to a man , they have been very supportive of the idea			0
" @entity16 took me under his wing when i was a young rookie on @entity73 and gave me tremendous advice which was not only valuable then but has continued to ring true for me throughout my professional career			0
" his views and ideas about @entity8 particularly have consistently proved to be spot on and i really enjoyed working with him as a vice captain in 2006 when i was a player			0
" @entity7 added that he is spoiled for choice when it comes to his other vice captains but he will only name them once he learns who has qualified automatically for the @entity9 team in september			1
among the possible candidates are @entity86 of @entity87 and @entity89 duo @entity88 and @entity90 , who captained @entity9 to victory in 2012			0
" it 's quite clear a lot of potential further vice captains could more than likely qualify for the team , " said @entity7			1
" a lot of them would still like to make the team so i just do n't want to distract them by talking about @entity8 and so they can focus on making the side			0
" @entity102 , the captain of the @entity104 team , has also already unveiled two of his vice captains : @entity107 , 71 , and @entity108 , 63			1
@entity110 's @entity109 meanwhile , the opening action of the @entity112 was suspended after dangerous weather affected the first day at the @entity115 course at @entity116			1
@entity104 @entity117 had been top of the leaderboard , five under par after 10 holes , before the combination of a tornado watch and violent thunderstorms prompted a halt in play			0
world no. 2 @entity126 , who can replace @entity128 at the top of the rankings with victory , was level par -- with @entity128 , the defending champion , one over -- after both had gone through six holes .			0

@entity23 's @entity15 and @entity137 named as first @entity9 vice captains
captain @entity7 says he will wait for team line up before naming remaining vice captains
both @entity15 and @entity16 have won the competition before
