a self - admitted tech geek , @entity4 is president of @entity7 , a blogging network			1
best thing about ' em ? you do n't even have to take your film in to the corner drugstore to get developed -- because digital cameras do n't rely on film to make their pictures " stick			2
" thanks to technology , the entire process , from clicking the shutter to printing the pictures , is now entirely within the power of the consumer			0
maybe you 've taken a picture that 's just not as perfect as you 'd like it to be			2
instead of being at the mercy of a darkroom - shackled photo lackey to improve upon it , you 've got more tools than ever to take it upon yourself to edit , store , organize , and share your images with the world			1
here 's a roundup of 10 free , and mostly free , online tools for the budding digital photographer : 1			1

tweak to your heart 's content , then get creative with oodles of effects , fonts , shapes , and frames			2
" if you already use @entity45 for your photos ( here 's what i do with mine ) , you 're only a click away from taking a @entity34			2
that 's how i discovered it , and it 's worked fairly well for me to this point			2
@entity54 -- @entity57 " is a powerful editing tool and photo manager			0
with all the features professionals use and novices want , it 's easy to use , works in real - time , and allows you to edit many images at once			1
" you 'd wonder how something this extensive could be free - and it all runs within the browser			1
@entity68 -- @entity68 bills itself as " the world 's most advanced online image editor			1
" with it , you can edit photos from @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity45 , @entity76 , and " more places			0
" i 'm not quite sure what " more places " means , but last i checked , this does not include a phone booth			0
@entity83 -- " @entity83 is a free online photo editor ; jump in and start : edit , adjust , filter			1
it 's just what you imagine ! " @entity88 says it 's the " fastest growing photo editor online			1

@entity98 -- @entity98 is a suite that includes the ability to edit images , add effects , add text , and print the results on everything from mugs to posters			1
you might be overwhelmed with the options here , but ... is n't that better than being underwhelmed ? 6			0
@entity112 -- @entity113 's @entity112 was really the first image editor of its kind to herald in the age of digital photography , though it was designed for professionals and its endless options could be daunting ( and bank - breakingly expensive ) for the layman			1
now , @entity112 is on the @entity121 to help that very same layman -- for free or plus levels of membership -- edit , store , and share his photos			1
lots of helpful tutorials promise to guide the casual user through editing pickles			0
@entity131 -- @entity131 's tagline is " fun with photos made easy			0
" it 's another flavor of photo editor / storage center that , like @entity137 , allows you to print the results to mugs , bags , and t - shirts			1
@entity131 invites developers to check out its @entity144 for more personalization options ( which is usually a good thing )			0
aviary -- aviary lets you : " edit images , create mind - blowing effects , design logos , find colors , collaborate , and more			1
all you need is a web browser			0
" this particular brand looks to be the one to beat , as they have several different tools in development			0
i 'm guessing that within five years , this one is going to be at the top of every person 's list of web - based image editors			1
@entity168 -- @entity168 says it 's " the easiest free online picture editor " and that it has " processed over five million pictures			1
" i say they 're easy enough , but not necessarily the easiest			0
everything 's relative , no ? 10			2
@entity174 -- @entity175 lets you " take crazy ( or not ) snaps with your webcam straight from your browser			1
" i featured this one in a @entity0 live video a while ago , and it certainly deserves to be mentioned again			0
if you 're looking for something else to do with your webcam , give it a cameroid ( which is n't as painful as it might sound )			0
as you can see , there are plenty of options for photo editing , storing , and sharing out there			0
some are going to fit your personal workflow more neatly than others , so it 's worth it to try a few and see what works best for your needs			0
or maybe you swear by something that i totally missed ? do n't be a miser - share it with the rest of the class ! we 'd love to know about it .			0
