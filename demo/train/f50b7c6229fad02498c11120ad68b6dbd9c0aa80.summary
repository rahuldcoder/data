-- may 6 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 @entity8 , @entity9 transcript this is a @entity12			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity16 , @entity17 : hi , i 'm @entity19 , and this is @entity0			2
give us 10 minutes , we 'll give you today 's commercial - free headlines , starting with protests over in @entity5			1
first up : @entity24 @entity25 : the country has a massive debt			1
we 're talking nearly $ 400 billion			2
that is bigger than the entire nation 's economy			1
the @entity5 government is considering some plans to get try to that debt under control			1
those plans include spending cuts , and those are not popular with a lot of workers			2
yesterday , thousands of @entity5 went on strike			1
they walked off the job because of the proposed cuts and they took to the streets to protest			2
this one is at the @entity5 parliament building			1
lawmakers were inside going over those proposals to cut spending			2
the people outside are workers : teachers , doctors , transportation employees			2
they were demanding that members of parliament come outside and face them			2
of course , police were out all over the country to deal with these protests			1
in some spots , that led to fighting between the police and the protesters			2
some people in the crowds threw bottles , rocks and sticks at the officers			2
in the capital city of @entity4 , a fire bomb hit a bank , killing three people inside			2
@entity76 lawmakers held a moment of silence for the victims			2
in terms of @entity5 's debt , the country is getting some help from the @entity84			1
on sunday , it agreed to an aid package worth $ 145 billion			2
but in order to get that package , @entity5 must adopt some of those cost - cutting measures that it 's considering			1
is this legit ? @entity91 , @entity17 : is this legit ? the @entity93 government has a list of people who are not allowed on board airplanes			1
legit ! it 's called the no fly list			1
@entity100 @entity25 : and the government is making some updates to it , specifically , how often airlines have to check it			2
this is based on changes to the no fly list or when names are added to it			2
in the past , airlines had 24 hours to check the list after they were told about an update			2
now , they 'll have to do it within two hours			0
the goal of this is to prevent a repeat of what happened on monday			0
that 's when @entity121 , a suspect who 's been arrested in connection with the failed bombing plot in @entity124 , was allowed to get on a plane even though his name was on the no fly list			1
@entity121 's name had been added to the list earlier in the day			1
but because it was within that old , 24 - hour window , the airline had n't checked the updated list when it sold him a ticket			0
as we told you yesterday , there were other things that did raise red flags , including the fact that @entity121 bought his ticket in cash			0
so , authorities were able to find and arrest him before his plane took off			0
oil spill @entity25 : one leak down , two to go			1
@entity147 says the smallest of three leaks in the @entity150 has been sealed			0
more than 200,000 gallons of oil have been leaking into the @entity150 every day			1
plans are now underway to stop the biggest leak			0
in the next few days , officials expect to place a pollution containment chamber -- the four - story , steel box you see right here -- over that leak			0
if it works , a second box will be used to cover the last leak			0
the plan is to collect the oil inside those boxes and then pipe it up to ships on the surface			1
reports indicate that the oil is getting closer to shore			1
miles of booms -- these sort of floating barriers -- have been put in place to try to control the spill			1
@entity176 gives us a closer look			0
( begin video ) @entity180 , @entity181 national correspondent : we 're 35 miles south of @entity182			0
these are the @entity6 , actually in @entity7 waters , and right now you are looking at the oil that is threatening to come on this island			1
protective boom 's right here ; this yellow thing is the boom			1
but this is the oil from the massive oil slick			1
people on the coastline , obviously in @entity7 , @entity182 , @entity198 and @entity199 , are very concerned			1
but we can tell you , because we took a three - and - a - half hour boat ride to get out here , that the oil is still at least 35 or 40 miles away			1
i mean , you could see it right now : if it was n't for this protective boom , it would be on these islands			0
these islands are amazing wildlife refuges			0
they are places where migratory birds come on their way between @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			0
and you can see the birds as the sun is going down on these islands			0
these islands used to be about 20 miles long , north to south			0
but because of hurricanes over the years -- @entity226 , @entity227 -- it 's now about 16 miles			1
and ultimately , the fear is that in the years to come and if there 's more damage here , the islands will be gone			1
they 're uninhabited ; no one lives here			0
although about a couple hundred years ago , there were a couple hundred people who lived on the islands			0
now , it 's a wildlife refuge			1
the oil you see is right here next to the boom , and there 's great concern it will go over the boom , on these islands , and then on the coastline			1
this is @entity176 , @entity181 , on the @entity6 , @entity7			1
( @entity250 ) this day in history ( @entity252 ) may 6 , 1915 - @entity253 hits his first major league home run			0
may 6 , 1937 - the @entity256 , the largest airship ever built , explodes as it arrives in @entity258			0
may 6 , 1954 - @entity259 becomes the first person to run the mile in less than four minutes			0
@entity262 @entity263 , @entity17 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity265 at @entity266 in @entity267 , @entity268 ! which of these events takes place in the month of may ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity276 , b ) veterans day , c ) @entity277 or @entity278 ) @entity279 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity276 is a salute to all branches of the @entity282 , and it falls on may 15			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! wounded warriors @entity25 : from tanks to @entity289 and even back to cavalry horses , troops are used to riding into battle			1
but the soldier ride is something that happens after the fighting is over			1
it 's part of the @entity297 program , which honors and helps members of the military who have been injured			1
last week marked the fourth cycle of the annual @entity292			0
you can have a look at it right here			0
( begin video ) @entity306 , wounded warrior : it 's like the doors are opening and you 're walking outside for the first time			1
@entity312 : all cyclists , you must stay in the lane the cruiser is in when you 're over there for them to accept the responsibility of the escort			0
@entity322 , executive director , wounded @entity324 : this is a great event			0
it 's progressed into a rehab ride where we 've got over 30 warriors here right now participating in a ride and getting out , sometimes for the first time , of a hospital and learning what they can accomplish again in life			1
@entity335 , @entity337 's wife : i also always see a big change in his mood with the bike ride coming up			1
there 's a lot of anticipation and a lot of excitement			1
@entity348 wade : i 've been going to the gym and riding exercise bikes for several hours			0
@entity351 : @entity352 had neurosurgery over in @entity354 and spent about two weeks in a neurosurgery intensive care unit there			0
it was doubtful that @entity352 was going to survive			0
it 's kind of surreal and it definitely puts things into perspective			1
i think it definitely helps you stay motivated when sometimes it 's easy this far post-injury to burn out from rehabilitation			1
@entity348 wade : it 's continuing my momentum for the future , and with the way things are looking , good into the future			1
( @entity250 ) blog report @entity25 : really like that story			0
well , @entity372 is talking to us			0
she says teachers are like her second parents			0
they help her fix her mistakes and learn from them			0
she 's just one of hundreds of people paying tribute to teachers this @entity380 ! @entity381 and @entity382 say mrs. @entity383 inspired them to be better people and to remember equality			2
@entity387 calls mr. @entity388 a big influence on her decision to become a teacher			0
mrs. @entity392 is a teacher that @entity393 can really relate to			0
she 's also the only one in class who laughs at my puns			2
i 'm glad someone 's laughing , mrs. @entity392 ! @entity399 , @entity400 , @entity401 and @entity402 all think mrs. @entity403 is the best teacher ever , saying her sense of humor helps them learn			2
@entity407 , @entity408 , @entity409 and @entity400 all praise mrs. @entity410 for making learning fun			0
we wish we could read all of these comments on air , but you can see them all on our blog at @entity418 ! before we go @entity25 : before we go , lawmakers have to deal with some serious issues			0
for example , serious questions about wildlife , like whose frog can jump the farthest			0
apparently , annoying the frog is a viable strategy , but not a winning one			0
this frog jumping competition is an annual event at the @entity9 state capitol , one that 's sure to put a little hop in your step			2
the winner has a name that is just perfect for government work			0
goodbye @entity25 : and that name is @entity439			0
it is a great thing when they write the puns for us			0
that ribbeting competition brings today 's show to a close			1
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity19 .			0
