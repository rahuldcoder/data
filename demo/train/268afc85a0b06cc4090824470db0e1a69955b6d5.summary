-- the body of @entity3 suspect @entity2 lies unclaimed in a state morgue			1
authorities had not yet determined a cause of death on wednesday , and no one had stepped forward to claim the body , said @entity10 , a spokesman for the @entity12 state medical examiner			2
the suspects ' mother , @entity13 , said she wanted her son to be buried near a @entity17 mosque and told @entity0 earlier in the week that family members had arranged for a funeral on tuesday or wednesday			1
but the @entity20 of @entity21 said wednesday that the family had not contacted local mosque officials with any funeral requests			1
the leadership of mosques in @entity17 and @entity27 have discussed the issue and decided that they will hold a funeral for @entity2 if they are asked by the family , said @entity33 , a spokeswoman for the executive director of the @entity20 of @entity21			1
in @entity37 , she said , " we do n't have excommunication			2
... this is our obligation			0
" suspects ' mother shares doubts about bombing usually , muslims are buried the same day as their death			2
but in addition to the delays required by an autopsy and the massive investigation into the bombings , several @entity51 leaders in the @entity21 area have said they would not perform funeral rites for a man accused of committing so much violence			1
since several of the top @entity57 in the @entity20 of @entity21 are not comfortable with presiding over the funeral , they would probably have a " layperson " do it if asked , @entity33 said			1
that would be done by an organization that does body - washings and funerals for several mosques in the community , she said			2
the @entity67 says @entity2 and his 19 - year - old brother , @entity68 , were behind last week 's double bombing at the @entity70 , which killed three people and wounded more than 260			1
@entity2 died early friday after a shootout with police , while the wounded @entity68 faces federal charges that could lead to a death sentence			1
" i do n't care who or what these criminals claim to be , but i can never recognize these criminals as part of my city or my faith community , " said @entity76 , executive director of the @entity77 , the largest mosque in the @entity21 area			1
@entity88 asked @entity89 twice to investigate @entity2 , official says " all of us @entity90 want these criminals to be brought to justice immediately , " @entity76 said			1
" i am infuriated at the criminals of these bombings for trying to rip our city apart			0
we will remain united and not let them change who we are as @entity90			0
" @entity2 attended prayers periodically at the society 's @entity17 mosque , and his younger brother occasionally came along , the group said in a statement issued monday			1
after he interrupted sermons twice , in november and january , to criticize the speaker , volunteer leaders " gave him a clear choice : either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed , " the statement said			0
" while these suspects did express views counter to our mosque 's philosophy , they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior , " it said			2
@entity123 has told investigators that his brother was the mastermind of the april 15 bombings and that the two were self - radicalized by the @entity128 , a @entity89 government official said tuesday			0
investigators are trying to corroborate his account , the official said			0
friend ' brainwashed ' bombing suspect , uncle says but @entity135 of the @entity136 said this week that he questioned media accounts describing @entity2 as a devout muslim			1
" a person who is devoted does not kill innocent people , " @entity135 said			0
the suspects ' mother has said she believes her sons were framed			0
" @entity2 was the most gentle , the most nicest , the most loving boy			2
they killed him , " she said			0
" i think now they will try to make my @entity68 guilty , because they took away his voice , his ability to talk to the world , " she added			0
" they did it because they did not want to truth to come out			0
" @entity0 's @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
