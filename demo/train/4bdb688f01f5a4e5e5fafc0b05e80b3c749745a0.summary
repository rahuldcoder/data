-- @entity1 dreamed of powering his village with the only resource that was freely available to him			1
@entity1 fits a lightbulb to a house in his village in @entity8			1
his native @entity8 had gone through one of its worst droughts seven years ago , killing thousands			1
his family and others were surviving on one meal a day			2
the red soil in his @entity17 hometown was parched , leaving his father , a farmer , without any income			1
but amid all the shortages , one thing was still abundant			1
" i wanted to do something to help and change things , " he said			2
" then i said to myself , ' if they can make electricity out of wind , i can try , too			1
' " @entity1 was kicked out of school when he could n't pay $ 80 in school fees , and he spent his days at the library , where a book with photographs of windmills caught his eye			1
" i thought , this thing exists in this book , it means someone else managed to build this machine , " he said			1
armed with the book , the then - 14 - year - old taught himself to build windmills			1
he scoured through junkyards for items , including bicycle parts , plastic pipes , tractor fans and car batteries			2
for the tower , he collected wood from blue - gum trees			1
" everyone laughed at me when i told them i was building a windmill			2
they thought i was crazy , " he said			0
" then i started telling them i was just playing with the parts			0
now , he has five windmills , the tallest at 37 feet			2
he built one at an area school that he used to teach classes on windmill - building			2
the windmills generate electricity and pump water in his hometown , north of the capital , @entity73			1
neighbors regularly trek across the dusty footpaths to his house to charge their cellphones			0
others stop by to listen to @entity8 reggae music blaring from a radio			1
when he started building the first windmill in 2002 , word that he was " crazy " spread all over his village			0
some people said he was bewitched -- a common description for people with perplexing behavior in some @entity90 cultures			0
" @entity92 , even my mother , thought that he had gone mad , " said his sister @entity91			0
villagers would surround him to snicker and point , @entity1 said			1
ignoring them , he would quietly bolt pieces using a screwdriver made of a heated nail attached to a corncob			0
the heat -- from both the crowd and the melted , flattened pipes he used as blades -- did not deter him			0
three months later , his first windmill churned to life as relief swept over him			0
as the blades whirled , a bulb attached to the windmill flickered on			0
" i wanted to finish it just to prove them wrong , " he said			0
" i knew people would then stop thinking i was crazy			0
" @entity1 , now 22 , is a student at the @entity114 , an elite @entity90 school for young leaders			1
donors pay for his education			0
his story has turned him into a globetrotter			0
former @entity121 vice president @entity120 , an avid advocate of green living , has applauded his work			0
@entity1 is invited to events worldwide to share his experience with entrepreneurs			1
during a recent trip to @entity128 , @entity129 , he saw a real windmill for the first time -- lofty and majestic -- a far cry from the wobbly , wooden structures that spin in his backyard			0
former @entity136 correspondent @entity135 , who covered @entity137 , wrote a book , " the boy who harnessed the @entity22 , " after hearing @entity1 's story			1
the book was released in the @entity121 last week			2
@entity135 , a native of @entity142 , @entity143 , said he lived with @entity91 in his village for months to write the book			2
the story was a refreshing change after years of covering bloody conflicts in the region , @entity135 said			2
@entity1 is part of a generation of @entity137 who are not waiting for their governments or aid groups to come to their rescue , according to the author			1
" they are seizing opportunities and technology , and finding solutions to their own problems , " @entity135 said			0
" one of the keys of his success is ... he 's never wanted to rest on his laurels			0
