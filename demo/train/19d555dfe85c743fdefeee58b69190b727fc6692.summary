sometimes less so ( @entity22 )			2
major world events contribute to international buzz -- the @entity25 placed @entity26 atop many " hottest 2012 destinations " lists			1
savvy marketing makes a difference			2
the current " it 's more fun in the @entity34 " campaign has helped attract visitors to that vastly underrated country			2
the chance whims of pop culture can unexpectedly thrust a heretofore obscure place into the spotlight			2
by now you 've probably heard of the @entity43 district of @entity44			2
you could n't have said that this time last year			1
when compiling our list of 2013 hot spots , we took into account all of the above and more while canvassing travel sites , experts and organizations to identify up and coming destinations based on bargains , significant events and important new services , such as added airline routes and major hotel openings			1
our hot seven are n't the only " new " places ready to be discovered in the coming year , but they 're a solid start			1
where will you be traveling in 2013 ? let us know your " hot destinations " in the comments section below			2
@entity66 , @entity67 @entity66 has seen fit to dub 2013 the " @entity68 , " and what better time to do it ? anyone who saw the 2012 @entity73 thriller " @entity74 " walked away wishing they too could race through @entity66 's dramatic countryside and hide out in its misty highlands ( granted , while not being pursued by a homicidal @entity78 )			2
of many outdoor events and special deals planned around the @entity68 , highlights include : the @entity82 2013 ( march 29 - april 14 ) ; @entity83 2013 music festival ( july 17 - 20 ) ; @entity85 ( september 7 - 22 ) ; and , of course , @entity88 golf tournament ( july 14 - 21 )			2
more independent - minded trekkers will find 2013 a good year to tackle part of @entity66 's @entity91 , a network of long - distance routes across the country			1
the entire length of the country -- all 750 kilometers of it -- can be walked via the recently announced @entity96			0
the trail , which runs from the @entity99 border to @entity100 , travels past pristine lochs and haunting glens as it follows mainly existing routes , such as the @entity104 and @entity105			0
should @entity66 give the @entity67 the highland fling ? 2			0
@entity107 , @entity108 what a difference a little recognition makes			1
travelers have long overlooked @entity108 's low - key capital , instead being seduced by the heady sights and sounds of @entity115 or beachside charm of @entity117			1
that 'll change in 2013 with the elegant city in the northwest of the country having been designated a @entity122 in july 2012			1
this means word is just starting to get out about what the @entity126 folks call @entity107 's " fertile exchange between the @entity130 past and @entity132 modernism			0
" exhibit a : the historic old town featuring the magnificent twelfth - century @entity135 and a picturesque medina overlooking the @entity137 with largely hassle - free shopping			0
exhibit b : @entity107 's charming @entity141 - built new town with wide boulevards and lovely cafes			0
a shiny new tramway links the capital to its sister city @entity147 , while a new airport terminal means the city has become much more accessible			1
@entity107 ( area population 1.7 million ) is hitting the proverbial travel radar , but it 's far from overrun -- that makes 2013 the year to be there now			1
@entity156 , @entity157 thanks in part to its medieval old town and vibrant mix of @entity162 , @entity163 , and art nouveau architecture , the compact yet captivating eastern @entity167 city of @entity156 ( population 250,000 ) has been chosen 2013 's @entity169 ( along with @entity170 in @entity141 )			0
to say that city officials are excited is an understatement -- they 've planned at least 300 cultural events for 2013			0
the @entity175 opening ceremony will be held january 19 and 20 and is , according to officials , " conceived as a unique , two - day inspirational event which will enliven the whole city			0
" events will be spread across town , from the @entity181 to a stage on major @entity183 to numerous clubs and restaurants			1
throughout the year , activities will draw on the city 's @entity167 and @entity188 heritage and include music festivals , theater , art and street performance			1
just as enjoyable is people watching along a pedestrian - only main drag while taking in the @entity196 and sipping a @entity197 , the city 's official cocktail ( with a super-secret recipe )			0
@entity203 multi-country @entity205 trips usual mean long , bumpy journeys on bad roads or budget - busting charter flights between destinations			1
the november 2012 launch of @entity211 , @entity203 's new @entity212 ‐ style , low - cost airline , promises to revolutionize travel in the region			1
@entity211 currently operates a small fleet of @entity217 from its @entity219 base in @entity220 , connecting the capital to the trekking mecca of @entity223			1
it also flies to @entity224 on the southern shore of @entity226 , handy for the western @entity227			0
according to @entity229 , the airline will establish a second base of operations in @entity232 in early 2013 , and add operation centers later in the year in the @entity205 capitals of @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 , @entity238			1
other destinations slated for 2013 include @entity240 in @entity241 ( allowing cheaper access to the country 's mountain gorillas ) and beach resorts of @entity246 in @entity219 and @entity247 in @entity248			0
with one - way fares as low as us $ 20 ( excluding taxes and surcharges ) , remote parts of @entity203 will be a lot easier to get to in 2013			0
