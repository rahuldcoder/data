-- " app " has been a computing term for a lot longer than five years			2
but , on july 10 , 2008 , it began its journey to becoming a household word			0
that 's when @entity8 , a year after launching the @entity9 , introduced its @entity10 to the world			1
the online marketplace launched with 500 apps , mostly for established @entity15 companies such as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			2
today , it has more than 850,000			0
and , a couple of months ago , it passed a mind - boggling threshold , marking the 50 billionth app to be downloaded			1
@entity8 can no longer claim proprietary ownership of apps , those mini-programs that continue to push the boundaries of what a mobile phone can do			2
@entity30 launched its own app store , now called play , less than a year after @entity8			1
today , it 's on a path toward surpassing @entity8 's number of downloads			1
but the @entity9 was the first smartphone most folks ever saw , and the app store was the accessory that gave it extra usefulness			2
on this anniversary , we look at five iconic apps that got a huge lift from the @entity10 and expanded the capabilities of our phones			2
' @entity46 ' before the @entity10 , video games were , by and large , for hard - core players with consoles or souped - up pcs. now the line between who is a gamer and who 's not is blurry -- and millions of people have " @entity46 " to thank			1
the deceptively addictive little game , in which players fling a flock of ... well ... angry birds at their pig nemeses , is the top - selling paid app in the @entity10 's history			1
since its launch in 2009 , the game has become a franchise , with spinoffs , toys , cartoons and even a movie making up just part of @entity71 developer @entity69 's furious , feathered empire			2
addicted gamers are sweet on ' @entity73 ' @entity74 with the rise of @entity30 's @entity78 system as @entity8 's chief mobile rival , there 's a certain irony that one of its products was a key to the @entity10 's success			1
but since @entity74 rolled out as a native app for the @entity9 , the ability to get directions on the go has become one of mobile computing 's key features			0
( does anyone still hand - draw maps ? ) yes , there are other map apps out there			0
but @entity30 's treasure - trove of data makes its maps a go - to for millions			0
witness the mini-disaster @entity8 had on its hands when it bumped @entity30 's offering for its own @entity74 app last year			1
@entity8 's product was so half - baked that ceo @entity106 , in a rare mea culpa , essentially told users to download @entity74 until it was fixed			1
how to kickstart your holiday using apps not maps @entity112 by 2008 @entity112 already had become a popular web - streaming service , letting users seed their own personal radio stations with bands or songs they liked			1
but the company was quick to see the potential in mobile computing , and @entity112 was among the first apps available when the @entity10 went live			1
since then , it 's become the second-most downloaded @entity9 app in the store 's history , trailing only @entity16			1
its proof of concept -- that users want to be able to bring their music with them anywhere -- also helped inspire a host of competitors , from @entity132 to @entity133 to @entity134			0
why everybody 's building a @entity15 music service @entity137 mobile phones , particularly smartphones , made all of us photographers			0
that 's a huge shift			0
but , sadly for most of us , it did n't make us all good photographers			0
enter @entity137 -- with a slate of editing tools and funky filters that can make even the most pedestrian pictures look good			0
add to that @entity137 's social features , complete with @entity152 - like hashtags , and you 've got a tool tailor - made for mobile			0
launched in 2010 by @entity157 students , @entity137 now moves about 45 million images every day			0
oh ... and those creators also sold it to @entity16 last year for a cool $ 1 billion			2
@entity137 launches 15 - second video feature @entity162 it seems like a little thing , until you stop and think about it : what if your phone could listen to a few seconds of a song , then tell you what it is ? that would have sounded like magic not so many years ago			1
now , we take it for granted			0
@entity162 started in the @entity177 in 2002 as a web service			0
but it was front and center at the beginning of the mobile revolution , and is now among @entity8 's top 10 downloaded apps , with 350 million users			1
20 fun and useful new mobile apps			0
