-- so you want to become a pro golfer			0
the top players rake in millions of dollars each year , and you want a piece of the action			1
whether you 're a promising five - year - old , an amateur trying to make the next step or a professional seeking to kickstart your career , the best way forward is generally to work with the people who 've been there and done that			1
they might not always be cheap , but golf academies offer training techniques that have taken the likes of @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 to the top of the tree			1
but fear not , @entity0 has some tips from one of the sport 's leading instructors , @entity24			1
there are three areas where beginner golfers struggle , he says			0
first off , you need to hold the club right			0
" most people grip the club too much in the palm of the hand , which creates tremendous tension and does n't allow the wrist to work correctly , " says @entity24 , who helped @entity32 go from a nearly man to the winner of six major titles between 1987 - 1996			1
" people who do this wear a hole in their glove			0
it 's important to hold the club out towards the fingers , not the palm			2
it helps more golfers than you can believe			2
" next , learn how to bow			0
" so much of golf is based around how you set your foundations			1
it 's really important that when golfers set up for the ball that instead of having slouchy round shoulders , pull your shoulders down , then your arms can actually get to your chest , " the 59 - year - old says			1
" almost like how the @entity65 how bow : rear end out , slightly bend your knees , pull your shoulder blades down and arms resting in your chest , and you 're in perfect position			0
" from there , it 's all about the arms			2
" make sure your arms and chest always stay together through the swing , " @entity24 advises			0
" practice little wedge shots -- put a club - head cover or towel under the left armpit and make little half - swings			2
" along with @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity24 is one of the most renowned coaches in the golf world			1
their success with major champions such as @entity32 , @entity18 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 has helped them launch golf schools around the globe			2
an hour with @entity83 would cost you $ 600 , according to @entity102 , while @entity84 charges $ 500 and @entity24 brings in $ 3,500 for a three - hour tuition			1
but unless you are a top player , or paying hefty corporate rates , it 's unlikely you 'll get one - on - one time with these gurus			1
the next best thing is their schools , which range from short workshops to full - year programs for school - age players			1
these are n't cheap , either			0
a student accepted into @entity84 's @entity116 , based on @entity117 in the @entity118 , needs a $ 7,000 deposit just to reserve their place			2
however , there are cheaper holiday programs available			2
@entity84 , who worked with 14 - time major winner woods from 2004 - 2010 , also lent his name to an academy in @entity127 , at the @entity129 resort on @entity130 , where 2005 @entity132 teacher of the year @entity131 was installed as head instructor			2
@entity83 , whose father @entity134 won the 1948 masters at @entity136 , took on @entity18 as a top young amateur in 1993 and helped transform the @entity118 into a global phenomenon -- spending a record 264 weeks as world no. 1 -- until their split in 2004			1
his @entity143 - based golf school offers three - day courses with the man himself for $ 5,900 ( including four nights ' accommodation at @entity149 ) , and a similar package with his staff professionals for $ 2,400			1
junior deals cost just $ 225 , while video lessons are offered for $ 30 an hour			0
@entity24 became a coach after failing to qualify by one shot at the @entity156 as a hopeful young professional			2
" i went and studied with some of the top coaches at the time , " he told @entity0 of his early days before making his name refining the swing of fellow @entity159			1
" he was a successful player by the time he came to see me , but he realized he needed an extra gear if he was going to win the big ones , " @entity24 said			0
" he was very much a perfectionist , and the challenge was we did n't see immediate results , it took a couple of years			0
we had to work through that period where we were n't getting good results , but it all worked out in the end			0
" @entity24 's @entity176 - based academy , with 36 holes designed by former client @entity92 , has become the headquarters for a worldwide empire located in 13 countries including @entity181 and @entity127			1
former child prodigy @entity182 was one of his most famous students , and he has worked with four players who have reached golf 's no. 1 position			1
" a coach these days is much more than just a swing instructor , you 're almost a part - time psychologist as well , " @entity24 said			2
he expects the trend of @entity193 players dominating the women 's pro ranks to spill over onto the men 's circuit soon			1
" they have the discipline			0
it 's a great sport for the @entity193 mind : they 're very methodical , very even - keeled and have tremendous work ethics			1
not only in golf but in all walks of life			2
it 's an ideal sport for them to play			2
" @entity20 , another of @entity24 's success stories , is also helping to teach young players in his native @entity211			1
the 41 - year - old , a three - time major champion and the @entity156 's all - time leading money winner , set up a foundation in 1999 that focuses on kids from families with limited resources			1
his players take on those from @entity18 ' foundation in an annual @entity224 - style match play competition			1
the most successful graduates so far are @entity96 and @entity226			0
@entity96 stunned the golfing world in 2010 by winning the @entity228 after making the halfway cut in only one of his eight previous major appearances			2
" things were n't going that great on the farm , and we just heard of this foundation which had just started , " @entity96 told reporters at @entity234 about his early days			0
" it was an unbelievable three years with what @entity20 did for me , traveling around the country , helping with expenses , giving clinics , things like that			0
he 's such a good mentor , probably without him i would n't have been here			0
" @entity96 has also worked with @entity85 , a coach who helped @entity247 win the @entity248 last year and clarke the 2011 @entity228			0
@entity85 , who has academies in his native @entity250 and @entity251 , counts eight - time @entity253 no. 1 @entity252 and @entity96 's @entity254 - winning compatriot @entity226 among his former clients			1
he also helped @entity19 to become world no. 1 last year , and move within striking distance of overhauling @entity20 ' @entity253 money record			0
@entity19 is another player giving back to the golfing community			0
the 38 - year - old runs clinics at courses across @entity250 , and has branched out with sessions in @entity181 at @entity263			0
non-residential academies cost about $ 235 for three days , with entrants having the chance to win equipment and a day playing with @entity19			0
@entity20 believes that such schools are vital for golf 's continued development			1
" i do n't think there 's another sport that does more for its young participants , " he wrote on @entity273 's website			1
" @entity18 , myself and a lot of other guys on tour all can remember those who helped us when we were growing up			0
it is why we give back to the game at the junior and grass - roots level			0
" the future of the game is bright , but only if we continue to make golf accessible to the younger generation			0
if we all do our bit , the combined effect is significant			0
" i believe that introducing and encouraging a youngster in golf gives them a step up on life 's ladder			1
if they go on to become great players , that 's a bonus			1

@entity102 's best - known coaches have set up academies all around the world
they cater for young players , professionals and weekend *warriors*
one - on - one tuition is expensive but cheaper *options* are available
working with golf 's top names helps coaches establish their empires
