@entity0 -- @entity2 has urged @entity4 president @entity3 to call off a meeting at the @entity6 with @entity8 spiritual leader the @entity7 that 's scheduled to take place friday			1
" by arranging a meeting between the president and the @entity7 , the @entity4 side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of @entity2 , seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair @entity2 - @entity4 relations , " @entity12 spokeswoman @entity11 said in a statement friday			1
