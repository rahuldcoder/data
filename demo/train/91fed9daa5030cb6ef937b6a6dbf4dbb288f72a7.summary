-- @entity1 said wednesday that it has chosen a @entity3 company to carry out the next phase of the underwater search for @entity6 , which mysteriously disappeared five months ago this week			1
@entity1 deputy prime minister @entity7 announced at a news conference that @entity9 will use two vessels for the search in the southern @entity12 , where the @entity14 plane is believed to have gone down after it flew off course and dropped off radar			1
the two ships will be equipped with towed deep - water vehicles and will also use side - scan sonar , multi-beam echo sounders and video cameras in the search , @entity1 authorities said			1
@entity9 , which has operations in the @entity1 city of @entity26 , is engaged as a single , private contractor to search for the missing plane -- and if it successfully locates it , to positively identify and map the wreckage			1
the operation , which is expected to begin in september and last as long as a year , will slowly scan some 60,000 square kilometers ( 23,000 square miles ) of the ocean floor , looking for any sign of aircraft debris			1
' no simple answer ' it 's not yet clear exactly how the deep sea search will play out			2
while the @entity39 , which is overseeing the underwater search at @entity14 's request , has developed the overall strategy , the independent contractor will be responsible for day - to - day operations in the search zone			1
" we are still ... working out the details of the techniques to be used , which will vary depending on the topography of the ocean floor , " @entity39 chief commissioner @entity45 said wednesday			1
" so there 's a range of possibilities			0
we have n't gotten the full detail of our search plan because we have to do that on a collaborative basis with @entity58			1
so there 's no simple answer			0
" @entity1 now estimates a yearlong underwater search will cost $ 48 million			1
according to @entity7 , the amount of money @entity14 will contribute to the next phase is yet to be agreed			1
he said he expects to discuss that with his @entity14 counterpart later this month			1
when asked if @entity68 , which had the greatest number of passengers on board the flight , would contribute financially to the next phase , @entity7 said @entity75 has n't " indicated an intention to assist in that way			1
" mapping the ocean floor some 1,800 kilometers ( 1,100 miles ) off the coast of @entity1 , a pair of survey ships continue their efforts to give search teams a better understanding of what lies thousands of meters below the surface in one of the most uncharted , remote places on the planet			1
the @entity90 's @entity89 and the @entity1 - contracted @entity91 have covered roughly 60 % of the priority search area , which the @entity39 says is the most likely resting place of @entity6			1
a @entity14 survey ship is on schedule to join them this month , and underwater mapping is expected to wrap up in september			1
according to the @entity39 , the data collected by survey ships is being converted into detailed topographical maps			0
so far , it says , those maps show ocean depths ranging from 1,500 meters to nearly 5,000 meters ( roughly one to three miles ) , and wide - ranging terrain that includes everything from flat , sloping surfaces , to rugged terrain like mountains , ridges and cliffs			2
@entity112 , an oceanographer and director of special projects at the @entity115 , who was involved in the search for @entity118 , said that a high level of detail is critical to make sure the search is carried out effectively and safely			2
" you have to know where you 're going or you 'll end up impacting the bottom , " he said			0
" we 're looking at less than a handful of tools that can work in this depth and that are available , so you really do n't want to risk anything			2
" one of the most challenging spots , @entity112 pointed out , is at the southern end of the search area , where he expects to see pockets of terrain up to 7,000 meters deep ( four miles )			2
" the south side of that @entity143 is a monstrous wall ... almost two miles top to bottom , almost vertical , " @entity112 explains , adding that there are only a few pieces of equipment worldwide that would even have a chance of reaching such extreme depths			0
a slow , painstaking search according to @entity39 tender documents , @entity58 is required to begin the search no later than one month after signing the contract , and will be required to search all 60,000 square kilometers within 300 days			1
the towed side - scan sonar devices will each be attached to one of two ships , the @entity91 and @entity153 , with a cable , and will be capable of transmitting some data to the surface in real time			0
according to the @entity159 , that data will be analyzed by experts on the survey ships and on shore in @entity1			2
@entity163 's @entity112 said each type of search system has its strengths and weaknesses , noting that towed systems work well on flat terrain and cover ground quicker			0
in more rugged areas , a drone which hugs the bottom will likely do a better job , albeit at a slower pace of around 65 square kilometers ( 25 square miles ) a day			1
for the most extreme terrain , @entity112 said , search teams may need a remotely operated vehicle ( @entity179 ) , steered from a surface ship with a tether			0
@entity14 has already partnered with @entity183 and @entity1 contractors to supply additional search equipment , including a towed side - scan sonar and @entity179			1
it 's not yet clear how these will be integrated into the larger , @entity1 - run operation			2
where to start ? where the search teams begin their work will depend on what the underwater maps show			0
" if there 's a chunk of fairly smooth terrain and fairly shallow , you could get a lot of ground covered early on , which raises spirits a little bit , " @entity112 said			0
but there 's a lot of ground to cover			0
the area search teams hope to tackle over the next year is four times the size of the search zone for @entity209 447 , which went down in the mid-atlantic in june 2009			0
and with a greater area to search , and multiple search assets involved , the operation becomes far more complex			0
" the worst thing that we could do is have a ship show up with technology , have them go over the spot ... and you write that spot off forever , " @entity112 said			0
but he added that he is completely confident in the @entity39 's ability to manage the overall operation , saying that if the wreckage of @entity6 is in the designated search zone , it will be found			1
are they looking in the right place ? there is far less confidence about whether search teams are looking in the right spot			0
the search for @entity6 continues to focus along the seventh arc , the so - called " partial handshake , " which experts believe was the last signal sent between the @entity237 plane and a communications satellite operated by @entity239			1
" what i 'm a little concerned about ... is that there still seems to be some confusion about @entity239 data and how it 's being interpreted , " said @entity241 , a former safety inspector at the @entity242 and author of " @entity244			0
" in late june , the @entity39 announced it was moving the priority search area several hundred kilometers southwest , the second major shift of the search zone along the arc			2
that move was based on analysis of the satellite data and a review of aircraft performance limits , including speed and altitude , by an international group of experts			0
that analysis also made a series of assumptions , " in order to define a search area of practical size , " the @entity39 's june report said , including that the plane was flying on autopilot for a long period of time until it eventually ran out of fuel and crashed			0
not making that assumption , the report said , " would result in an impractically large search area			0
" no guarantees the @entity39 has said that the @entity239 data will continue to be reviewed during the next phase of the search , acknowledging that there is still a chance the hunt may be extended outside the 60,000 square kilometers designated as the priority area			1
" the haystack is a big chunk of terrain in the @entity12 , " @entity112 of @entity163 said			2
" and even though the haystack is huge there 's no guarantee that the needle is in that haystack			0
" @entity241 agreed , however , he adds the @entity39 is going about the search in a smart way : " am i confident they will find the airplane in that area ? no. but if it were my search , i would be doing exactly what they 're doing			2
" despite a potentially vast search zone , @entity45 said late last week that he 's cautiously optimistic that search teams will find the missing plane			0
" we 're doing this , in a large part , because we want to give some certainty to those who are grieving the loss of their loved ones , " he said			0
" and we 're fully committed to doing that			0
" @entity6 departed @entity312 for @entity75 early on the morning of march 8 carrying 239 passengers and crew members			2
on march 24 , @entity14 prime minister @entity315 announced that the flight had ended in the southern @entity12			1
to date , no trace of the plane has been found			0
@entity1 : @entity6 likely on autopilot with unresponsive crew in flight 's final stage for families of the missing , a hole in the clouds , an empty space on earth @entity6 families seek $ 5m for investigation , reward			1

new : @entity1 says amount of money @entity14 will contribute not yet agreed
