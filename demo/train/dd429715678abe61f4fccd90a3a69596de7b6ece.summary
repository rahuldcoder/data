it 's a wild , wet @entity2			0
mysterious filth rained down on @entity4 , @entity5			1
gales knocked trees down -- and power out -- in @entity9			1
and then they whirred over @entity11 's mountains with hurricane force			1
more rain is on the way			2
a new storm marching in from the @entity17 promises to leave a total of nearly 10 inches in spots along the coast between saturday and tuesday , the @entity15 said			0
that may cause mild to moderate flooding , particularly around rivers and streams			0
already on friday , some cars got stranded in flooded streets in @entity5 's @entity27 , and some residents exited their front doors aboard inflatable boats pulled by rescue crews			1
the rain is landing on a chronic , deep drought in @entity9 , but flooding and mudslides may become a concern			2
tens of thousands of households lost power on friday , and limbs had to be cleared from yards , windshields and roofs			2
as of saturday afternoon more than 43,000 customers in @entity9 still were without power , @entity44 said			2

some postulated what the source of the grime may be , including the weather service			0
could the jet stream have tracked it over from the hyperactive @entity73 volcano in eastern @entity74 ? it pumped volcanic ash 20,000 feet into the sky in late january			0
the dust settled as far away as the @entity79			0
then again , there are other active volcanoes that could be the source , including one that belched ash on wednesday in @entity84			0
or did winds blow up a different kind of ash from last year 's forest fires in @entity49 or @entity89 ? or was it just dust whipped up by high winds ? " we still do n't have a definite answer , " the service wrote on its @entity95 page			1
the wind gave @entity99 in @entity11 a raw shaving , whipping over at 134 mph			1
" that is equivalent to a weak category 4 hurricane , " said @entity1 meteorologist @entity101			1
