@entity1 , @entity0 -- schools throughout the small town of @entity1 , @entity0 , will be closed tuesday -- except for counselors on hand to help any students who want to come in to talk , to try to come to grips with the bloodshed that left one of their own dead			2
four students , meanwhile , spent the night in local hospitals for gunshot wounds -- two in critical condition at @entity19 in @entity20 , and one in serious condition and another in stable condition at @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity1 police chief police chief @entity12 said late monday afternoon			2
they all had been in the @entity27 cafeteria on monday morning , when two witnesses saw another student they later identified as @entity30 walk up to a table and start firing			1
" he was silent the entire time , " said @entity32 , who was just a few feet away from the shooter			2
" there was no warning or anything			2
" a teacher identified by students as @entity43 helped chase the gunman out of the school			1
police arrested the suspect -- whom they have not named , except to say he 's a juvenile -- nearby a short time later			1
one of @entity30 's friends , @entity49 , said she was in " complete shock " that @entity30 -- whom she described as a " a very normal , just teenage boy " -- could be responsible for the mayhem			1
" he did have a sad look in his eyes a lot of the time , but he talked normally ( and ) he never said anything strange , " @entity49 told @entity2			2
" it is a really big shock			2
" another friend , @entity61 , saw @entity30 being picked on regularly at school and said he put a wall around himself , reluctant especially to share anything about his personal life			1
one glimpse into his mindset may have come december 30 , when @entity30 posted a long , poetic rant on his @entity70 page centered " in a quaint lonely town , ( where there ) sits a man with a frown ( who ) longed for only one thing , the world to bow at his feet			1
" " he was better than the rest , all those ones he detests , within their castles , so vain , " he said , later thanking those who " liked " the post and saying he 'd written it in class one day			0
he concluded the post by writing , " die , all of you			0
" a student at @entity27 , @entity93 , said the victims were students who attended a nearby vocational school , and were waiting for a bus to take them there			1
@entity30 himself is a student at the @entity99 , said the school 's interim director , @entity100			1
the student killed in monday 's shooting was identified by his family as @entity105			1
" @entity106 was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him			1
the family is torn by this loss , " the family said in a statement released by @entity19			0
gov. @entity112 ordered flags to be flown at half - staff tuesday at the @entity115 , as well as throughout @entity116 , in honor of @entity118			1
why he was killed remains a mystery , as school and law enforcement authorities have not offered details as to the suspect 's motive			1
" i just ca n't believe it			0
i do n't think it 's real , " said student @entity126 , who witnessed the shooting			1
" and i just , it kills me that i saw someone hiding , and now that someone is now dead			0
" @entity126 said he heard a pop as he was walking with friends			0
he looked up to see a boy he did not recognize holding a gun , pointing it at a group of four students			1
" he just fired two quick shots at them , " said @entity126 , a freshman			0
" i saw one student fall , and i saw the other hiding , trying to get cover underneath the table			1
" @entity126 said he started to run when he saw the gun , but heard a total of five shots			1
multiple calls reporting a shooting flooded into the police dispatch center beginning at 7:38 a.m. , @entity149 said			0
around that time , student @entity93 said , he had just arrived for his @entity154 class when an administrator " yelled ' lockdown ! ' " over the announcements			1
" all of a sudden , all the doors started slamming			2
you could hear them slam , " @entity93 said			0
" and we all turned off the lights , and we headed towards the corner			0
" after police got word from a dispatcher that a teacher had chased the suspect out of the school , officers went inside , soon followed by paramedics to help the injured students , @entity149 said			1
@entity173 , who was in his @entity175 class at the time of the shooting , said the actions of teacher @entity43 , the assistant football coach who is thought to have chased the gunman from the school , were very much in character			1
" coach hall , he always talks about how much he cares about us students , his team and everyone , " @entity173 said			0
" and today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us , that he would take a bullet for us			0
" it was unclear exactly how the suspect was captured			0
initial reports from police indicated that he may have turned himself in to bystanders , but @entity149 did not mention that			0
instead , he said officers " came up with the suspect " after starting a search shortly after the shooting			0
as investigators took over the school , students were evacuated to nearby @entity202 , said lt. @entity203 of the sheriff 's office			0
local officials , @entity206 education secretary @entity205 and several students credited frequent lockdown drills and the quick response of school authorities for helping keep the situation from becoming worse			2
the @entity27 shooting was the latest , but hardly the only mass shooting in recent years on school campuses			0
in addition to several at universities , including an april 2007 rampage at @entity219 that left 32 dead , the bloodiest attack on a high school campus was when teens @entity222 and @entity222 killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves at @entity227 's @entity226 in 1999			2
hours after calling off school monday , @entity1 school superintendent @entity228 said there would be no class on tuesday -- though counselors will be on hand at @entity234 and @entity235 , which is alongside the church in which a candlelight vigil is set for 7 p.m. tuesday , according to the superintendent			0
" i hope that every parent , if you have n't hugged or kissed your family in the last couple of days , take that time , " @entity228 said			0
