@entity0 -- forced government spending cuts , known in @entity0 jargon as sequestration , took effect a month ago amid doomsday predictions of freed criminals , weakened borders and a crippled military			1
president @entity10 and other federal officials warned that the harshest impacts would hit in april , with worker furloughs and program cuts rippling through the economy to stunt growth during a sluggish recovery			1
but as april dawned monday , little evidence of widespread damage had emerged , leaving the president vulnerable to accusations that he hyped the impact for political purposes in the unending battle with @entity25 over taxes and spending			1
the $ 85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013 , which ends september 30 , were mandated by a 2011 agreement by @entity32 that raised the federal debt ceiling			1
in an attempt to motivate legislators to compromise on a deficit - reduction plan , the agreement required $ 1.2 trillion in across - the - board spending cuts over a decade if @entity32 failed to strike a deal to shrink the deficit by that amount			1
@entity10 follows up on past call to bolster @entity44 infrastructure the cuts targeted agencies and programs dear to @entity48 , such as education , and also went after @entity25 priorities , including the military			1
it was a simple idea that now seems naÃ ¯ ve : make the threat of forced cuts so onerous and undesirable that a deal on deficit reduction would be inevitable			2
instead of instigating a bargain , sequestration became the latest deadline - driven fiscal crisis to reinforce the dysfunction of @entity32 in tackling what legislators and economists call the biggest challenge facing the nation -- reducing chronic federal deficits and debt			1
chart : real impact of cuts now , those sky - is - falling scenarios tied to the cuts seem to be in question , providing conservatives who seek to shrink government some political room to argue that it needs less money , not more , as @entity48 argue			1
to @entity81 , director of the @entity82 at @entity83 , both sides got some things right and others wrong			0
forecasts show a rebounding economy in 2014 and 2015 , with or without the cuts , he noted			2
" i think both sides were gaming it , " @entity81 told @entity1 , noting that the long , slow recovery caused everyone to underestimate the resiliency of the economy			0
@entity94 passes first budget proposal in four years " next year and the year after , i do n't think people are going to care about " the sequester , he added			0
one reason the impact has been less harsh than expected is that @entity32 and @entity10 agreed to change the rules for their implementation , effectively weaseling out of the penalty they previously agreed to for failing to compromise			1
a spending plan through september 30 that @entity32 passed and @entity10 signed last month gave the military and some agencies more leeway for absorbing cuts			1
because of the change , the @entity110 has reduced furloughs of some civilian workers from an initial total of 22 days to 14 , while the @entity115 has put off a decision on the furlough issue			1
other departments and agencies held down furloughs by freezing hiring , curtailing overtime and improving efficiency			2
federal meat inspectors avoided furloughs altogether due to additional money for the @entity126			2
some early steps to handle the spending cuts prompted headlines and controversy			1
@entity131 released more than 2,000 low - priority undocumented immigrants in order to save money , and the @entity135 announced it would close scores of control towers at smaller airports			0
overall , most @entity44 have yet to feel much pain			0
while some international travelers have faced longer lines when entering the country , the overall impact on airport security and other travel functions has been less arduous than initially feared			0
a @entity1 / @entity147 survey two weeks ago found 11 % of respondents were affected a " great deal " by the sequester and another 24 % cited " some " impact , while 43 % answered " none at all " and 21 % said " not much			0
" @entity81 noted that the cuts reduce planned spending for the rest of the current fiscal year and hold down increased spending over the coming decade			2
put another way , the total amount of government spending 10 years from now would be no lower than it is today if the full impact of the cuts take effect , he said			1
while the cuts will cause the equivalent in lost wages of 1.58 million jobs this fiscal year , the overall strength of the economy would easily overcome that hit and the effects of related austerity in coming years , @entity81 said			2
program recipients and some industries and businesses linked to federal workers , such as the @entity178 system and restaurants around the corner from government offices , would experience pain now , he said , but the cuts are " not going to shake the national economy to the core			1
" the issue remains a political fight in @entity0			0
who 's in the tower ? at some regional airports soon , no one @entity25 are criticizing the @entity10 administration for overstating the impacts in an attempt to pressure them into a deal			1
" there 's a lot of questions about how the @entity202 is handling the communications on this , " house speaker @entity196 said shortly after the cuts took effect on march 1			0
in response to a recent administration request for states to reimburse some already allocated funds due to the sequester , 31 @entity202 members -- including four @entity48 -- sent a letter last week calling the move " an obvious attempt ... to make the sequester as painful as possible			0
" @entity10 argues that anything to stunt economic growth as the recovery continues to struggle should be avoided			1
however , he may have lost some credibility after statements in the heat of the political battle in february that now seem overzealous			0
" federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go , " the president said on february 19			2
" air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks , which means more delays at airports across the country			0
thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off			0
tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids			0
hundreds of thousands of @entity44 will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings			0
" ten days later , with a compromise unreachable and the cuts kicking in , @entity10 toned down the rhetoric			2
" what 's important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away , " he told a news conference , later adding that " we will get through this			0
this is not going to be an apocalypse , i think as some people have said			0
and it 's going to hurt			0
" the bottom line , according to @entity257 and @entity258 of the @entity259 , is that the damage from the forced spending cuts " will accumulate in less visible ways , as irrational reductions in public spending impede economic growth and job creation ; reduce investments in education , infrastructure and scientific research ; and further disrupt the routines of a modern democracy			1
" " the longer the sequester remains in place , " they recently wrote in the @entity275 , " the more harm is inflicted			0
" @entity81 agreed that it would take years to assess the full impact of the sequester 's impact now , but said that in the end , renewed confidence would mean a growing economy and " we 'll forget about it at some point			1
" @entity32 avoids shutdown , bickers over 2014 budget @entity292 's @entity291 contributed to this report .			2
