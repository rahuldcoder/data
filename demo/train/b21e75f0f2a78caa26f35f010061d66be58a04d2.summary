-- can you think of one sport where men and women compete against each other as equals ? stumped ? try horse racing , where female jockeys regularly jump in the hot seat alongside their male counterparts			1
but it 's not just the riders facing - off as they thunder down the track			0
the horses carrying them towards the finish line are locked in their own battle of the sexes -- and it seems the animal kingdom is n't as different to humans as you might imagine			1
while male and female thoroughbreds are fairly evenly matched in physical ability , the girls must overcome commercial and even psychological constraints to get ahead in the sporting world			1
sound familiar ? " at the top level , it does take a special filly to beat the boys , " @entity27 , spokesman at the @entity29 @entity28 , told @entity0			0
a man 's world ? it may seem like quite a stretch comparing women in the workplace to fillies in the field , but just like that so called boardroom glass ceiling , female horses are the minority in the racing world			1
male horses -- known as stallions , geldings or colts depending on whether their manhood is still intact -- far outnumber females -- called fillies -- on the track			1
in @entity29 flat racing , 63 % of horses are male , while 37 % are female			1
it 's a similar story for the overwhelming number of male winners -- 67 % compared to just 33 % for the girls			2
even in @entity61 's most prestigious horse race -- the @entity62 -- only three fillies have won in the competition 's 138 - year - history			1
hormonal horses so why do boy horses rule the roost ? " it tends to be that male horses are a bit bigger and taller than females -- a bit like men and women , " said @entity27			1
" a lot of it also has to do with hormones			0
@entity79 , female horses are probably a bit more placid			2
and when they come into season -- have their periods -- they can be unpredictable			0
" that said , stallions -- male horses which have n't been castrated -- can also be flighty , if somewhat more aggressive on the track , added @entity27			1
even playing field ? yet compare their ability ratings -- zero for a dud to 140 for an unbeaten thoroughbred in the @entity29 -- and both genders score around the same			2
males have a median rating of 69 , while females score 64			2
" while size plays a role -- taller horses tend to have a longer stride -- i would n't necessarily say male horses have more stamina , " said @entity27			1
" in terms of distance , they 're probably equally adept			0
it 's more a question of parentage -- if mum and dad are sprinters , then their son or daughter will be the same			0
" the slight discrepancy in ratings , means male horses will often carry a few extra pounds in weights , to even out the playing field			1
bred for success the high number of male race horses may also be down to their profitability off the track			2
" from a racing industry perspective , if a male horse is successful on the racetrack , they will also be worth a lot more money as a breeding stud -- anything up to around $ 150,000 per offspring , " said @entity124 , head of postgraduate study in equine science at @entity29 's @entity127			1
" with a mare however , she will only be able to produce one foal a year			0
but if you get it right -- and it is rare -- you could have a breeding stallion which earns millions			2
" perhaps the best example of a super stud 's earning power is @entity29 colt @entity147 , which retired last year with an unbeaten 14 - win record			0
today , he commands a fee of $ 190,000 for each offspring and is expected to generate a staggering $ 150 million in his stud career			0
leading ladies that said , one of the most remarkable champions the racing world has ever seen also retired last year -- a female thoroughbred called @entity157			1
the @entity159 mare notched up 25 consecutive wins , becoming not just a national sports star but a celebrity who even graced the cover of @entity164			0
" her allegiance level is phenomenal , " @entity165 , one of @entity157 's eight owners , said			0
" she 's a powerful horse who just fronts up every time and people really like that consistency			0
" the girls may have some way to go in catching the boys			0
but it seems that even in the equine world , the race is far from over .			0
