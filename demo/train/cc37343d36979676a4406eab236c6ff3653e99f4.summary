@entity0 insists he is on the " right path " in his latest comeback but his defense of the @entity6 title was ended in a late night defeat to @entity9 's @entity8 -- snapping an incredible record in @entity12 semifinal matches on his favorite clay surface			1
@entity0 had racked up 52 straight wins over 12 years to reach title matches , but the battling @entity8 ended the streak with a 1 - 6 6 - 2 7 - 5 victory			1
he will meet @entity0 's fellow @entity19 @entity18 in sunday 's final			2
@entity0 , whose 2014 was disrupted by injury and illness after winning a record ninth @entity24 title , has struggled since his return to action , losing in the first round in @entity28 and the quarterfinals of the @entity30			2
but returning to clay in @entity33 , the world number three was a firm favorite to repeat his success of last year and had a winning 4 - 0 record over @entity8 going into their last four encounter			1
but after cruising to the first set , his opponent adopted a more aggressive approach and forced a deciding set			0
@entity0 , trailing 5 - 6 in the third set , finally cracked as @entity8 converted his third match point after a stunning rally , closing out victory after two hours 17 minutes			1
" i 'm really happy about this match , " @entity8 told the official @entity12 website			2
" i beat the best player on this surface			0
from the second set i played really well , and i tried to change a little bit to be more positive on court			0
" the match finished after midnight saturday local time and @entity0 had been kept on court until 3.30 am in his quarterfinal win over @entity59 @entity58 , but he refused to make excuses			2

" i 'm working well , i have the right attitude , i have to improve things and i think that i 'm on the right path and closer to the level of game that i 'm looking for			0
" the 27 - year - old @entity8 , who had himself been kept on court late friday night in his last eight clash with @entity71 @entity70 , will be bidding for his fifth @entity12 title , but has never beaten @entity18 in seven previous matches			1
@entity0 will now head to the @entity12 clay court event in @entity75 , @entity71 as he steps up his preparations to win a 10th @entity24 at @entity77 later this year			1
but his fourth defeat on clay in the course of the year , to @entity18 in @entity86 , world number one @entity78 in @entity79 and @entity80 in @entity81 were the others , leaves question marks over @entity0 's bid to make further history			1

on the @entity103 , @entity101 of @entity102 beat the @entity105 's @entity104 6 - 4 7 - 6 in the final of the @entity107			1
it was her 10th career title and will lift @entity101 to third in the world rankings behind @entity111 and @entity112			0
