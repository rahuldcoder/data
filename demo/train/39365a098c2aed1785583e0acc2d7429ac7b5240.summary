@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands packed @entity0 's @entity4 on saturday for @entity5 , drawing hordes of @entity1 demonstrators , spectators , and trade unionists from around the world -- including the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
" i 've never seen anything like it , " said @entity13 , a @entity12 labor unionist in attendance , wiping the sweat from his brow with his red labor hat			2
" it 's just amazing			2
" for years , since @entity1 's bearded revolutionaries toppled dictator @entity23 over half a century ago , residents have gathered in @entity0 on may 1 to listen to hours - long speeches from their former president , @entity25			1
the elder @entity25 made his last showing in 2006 before stepping down because of illness , at first temporarily and then permanently , leaving the reins to his younger brother , @entity29			2
since then , neither @entity25 has made a major speech on @entity31			0
this year was no different			0
in a carefully choreographed show of force , thousands took to the streets , carrying placards with the faces of @entity38 , @entity25 and @entity39 , and waving @entity1 flags as they sang and sweated beneath the hot @entity42 sun. " i am marching for @entity1 and for the @entity1 revolution , " said one @entity1 marcher as she passed through the square			1
@entity1 had billed this year 's march as a rebuke to international criticism from @entity49 and @entity50 over human rights issues recently bubbling up in the communist nation			1
in february , dissident @entity53 , who was jailed in 2003 during a crackdown on political opposition , died after a hunger strike that lasted for more than 80 days			0
he began the strike to demand better prison conditions			0
in an unprecedented government statement , @entity39 said he " lamented the death of @entity1 prisoner @entity53 , who died after leading a hunger strike			1
" he blamed the @entity11 for the death , but did not explain why			0
" tortured people do not exist , " @entity25 added			0
recently , an opposition group that calls itself the " @entity65 " -- made up of relatives of dissidents jailed in the 2003 crackdown -- has met recurring resistance from large groups of pro-government demonstrators , who surround the women and drown out their chants of " @entity75 " with such phrases as " this street belongs to @entity25			1
" the women on occasion are detained briefly by police before being driven back to their homes			0
saturday marked the second @entity5 since @entity11 president @entity82 took office			0
at the time of his election , @entity82 elicited a sense among many @entity1 that they might finally see an end to the economic trade embargo that has been in place since the administration of president @entity91			1
while @entity82 eased restrictions on small - ticket items such as family travel and telecommunications , and sent high - ranking envoys to @entity0 to foster fresh migration talks , broader discussions now appear at a standstill following a storm of criticism over @entity103 's death and increasingly routine counter-demonstrations in support of the government that overpower the handful of weekly protests			1
saturday 's @entity31 march began around 8 a.m. and lasted roughly two hours without incident .			2
