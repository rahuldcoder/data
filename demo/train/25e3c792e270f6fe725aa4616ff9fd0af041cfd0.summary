-- five years ago , the @entity2 government had a mystery to solve , and a @entity5 man who held the key to unlocking it readily offered a helping hand			2
president @entity8 had doubts about whether the great @entity11 hero @entity10 had died of tuberculosis , as most historical accounts state , or if he had been poisoned			2
an eventual test came back inconclusive , but so did the status of a " treasure trove " of artifacts that @entity18 had lent the government in its investigation			1
@entity18 is now suing @entity2 in a @entity21 federal court , fighting to reclaim the valued items			1
when @entity2 decided to investigate @entity10 's death , a necessary step would be to confirm that the remains the government would exhume indeed belonged to the revered hero			1
@entity18 , a photographer in @entity26 , could help @entity2 out with that			1
his ancestors were one of @entity30 's founding families with ties to @entity10 , and had passed down to him a small collection worthy of a museum : a one - of - a - kind medal from a grateful @entity35 , signed letters and , most unique , a lock of @entity10 's hair			1
his collection , particularly the dna from the hair , could confirm @entity10 's remains , and for a brief period in 2007 , @entity2 treated @entity18 like a king			1
a private jet flew him and his collection to @entity2 , where government officials greeted him			0
for a month , he accompanied the team of researchers who examined his artifacts			0
when he recalled that he had more artifacts at home , the @entity2 government promptly purchased him round - trip commercial airfare to go retrieve them			2
@entity18 returned home , and as the months turned into years , his contacts with the @entity2 diminished , according to a lawsuit filed in a @entity60 court			1
the @entity5 man did n't learn about the conclusion of the tests until he read about it in the press in july 2011 , the lawsuit says			0
the @entity2 government had agreed to return the collection , but in late 2011 , @entity18 found his calls going unanswered and his letters to the @entity2 embassy unreturned			2
@entity18 's suit says that @entity2 stole his belongings and must return the collection to him			1
" @entity2 's refusal to return the @entity75 is a clear act of expropriation of @entity18 's personal property in violation of international law , " the lawsuit states			1
" these items were taken from their rightful owner by the government			0
" the @entity84 in @entity85 did not immediately comment on the suit			0
@entity10 gave the items in the collection to @entity18 's great - great - grandfather , @entity89 , the lawsuit states			1
in addition to the lock of hair and @entity95 awarded by @entity35 , the collection also includes epaulets from the military uniform of @entity98 , whom @entity10 met in @entity99			2
most historians say that tuberculosis killed @entity10 , who died in 1830 at the age of 47			0
in 1819 , @entity10 founded @entity30 , a federation of what is now @entity2 , @entity30 , @entity105 and @entity106			2
he is credited with spreading democratic principles in @entity108			0
the exhumation was broadcast on television , and @entity8 admitted to crying as the remains were recovered			0
let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton			0
he is like lightning , like a sacred fire , " he said then			0
with the national anthem playing in the background , a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth , revealing a skeleton on the table below .			0

@entity18 provided artifacts that helped a @entity2 investigation
@entity18 let @entity2 use dna **sample*s* of @entity10 's hair to confirm his remains
but they never returned the *sample* or other artifacts to @entity18
he is now suing @entity2 in a @entity21 court
