@entity0 -- again stepping into the role of compromise - seeker , sen. @entity2 of @entity3 is launching what may be a long - shot effort to forge bipartisan compromise over a minimum wage increase			1
" i 'm reaching out to members on both sides of the aisle about whether or not it 's possible , " the @entity10 told a handful of reporters tuesday			2
" i do n't know whether it is			0
" @entity18 laid out a possible framework she is floating in initial conversations : â € ¢ wages : increase the minimum wage to something higher than the current $ 7.25 an hour , but lower than the $ 10.10 that @entity25 want			1
â € ¢ hours : to bring in more republicans , raise the number of hours that define " full - time " employees under @entity30			0
currently individuals working 30 hours or more are " full - time " under the law			0
â € ¢ small business : add an extension of small business tax credits			0
@entity37 budget aims to cut $ 5.1 trillion , balance in 10 years this is the latest example of @entity18 ' work toward finding space for a deal on large , divisive issues			1
she made one of the earliest proposals to avoid the government shutdown , spent weeks trying to find agreement on an unemployment benefits extension , and has regularly been a key vote allowing issues to come to the @entity52 floor			2
for @entity18 , $ 7.25 is too low			0
but , $ 10.10 an hour is just too high			1
" i 've talked to employers in @entity3 who have said they would have to curb hiring and actually have to lay people off with that kind of increase , " she said , " but they are open to a more modest increase , they could accommodate that			2
" but as @entity18 tries to find a middle ground , both sides of the debate continue digging in around polar positions			0
@entity69 takes minimum wage pitch to @entity71 " if ( a bill ) includes raising the minimum wage , then it 's a bad idea to put people out of work , " said sen. @entity72 of @entity73			1
he and many other republicans cite a @entity80 report which concluded that a minimum wage increase would cost the country hundreds of thousands of jobs			1
@entity72 was well known for his attempt at compromise over background checks on guns last year , but he insists he is not budging on the minimum wage			1
" if you ( increase it ) on a smaller scale , that i suppose makes it less bad , but it 's still bad , " he said			0
as @entity10 exclaim " jobs , " those on the left shout " poverty			2
" " that minimum wage pay of $ 7.25 an hour is really a starvation wage , " said sen. @entity98 , the @entity99 independent			1
he and many democrats point out that the same @entity80 report concluded that raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 would lift 900,000 @entity105 out of poverty , but a lower increase would have just one - third the effect			1
he insists he wo n't settle for a penny less than $ 10.10			1
" no , i strongly believe we need to have a $ 10.10 minimum wage			1
" senate majority leader @entity112 of @entity113 took a similar stance in february			0
and what 's more , @entity25 have been unyielding toward many potential changes to @entity30 , including proposals to redefine " full - time " employees			2
that leaves @entity18 in the middle			0
standing by herself outside the @entity52 doors , she smiled and stuck to her goal statement			0
" i 'm trying to see if ( a potential compromise ) could garner sufficient support , " she told reporters			0
@entity112 has said a minimum wage vote could come up in the @entity52 as soon as next week			1
asked for her timeline , @entity18 shrugged , " well , it 's coming up pretty fast			0
" @entity10 hit a nerve when it comes to @entity30			2

@entity10 sen. @entity2 is looking to see if a deal is possible
@entity3 senator has a *history* of trying to find deals on big , divisive issues
@entity25 want to raise the minimum wage nearly $ 3 , to $ 10.10 an hour
while it would cause some job cuts , the proposal would boost others from poverty
