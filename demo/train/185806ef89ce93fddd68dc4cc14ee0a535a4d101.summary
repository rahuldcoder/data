it appears fewer than 50,000 people successfully signed up for health coverage through the federally run @entity4 website during the first five weeks of open enrollment , falling well short of expectations for the period , the @entity0 reported on monday			1
the federal online application process has been marked so far by serious technical problems with @entity10 since its october 1 launch			1
the website was established as the main source of public information and the primary way for consumers to purchase private insurance online under the @entity4 , president @entity18 's signature domestic policy achievement			1
the @entity18 administration is scrambling to fix the problems and says website use is improving daily			1
it hopes to have the site running smoothly for most people by the end of the month			0
some states are running their own enrollment programs for @entity4 and are faring better			1
the online enrollment debacle combined with some people losing their health insurance because of @entity4 have energized @entity31 , who have hammered the president politically and see the rocky start as a potent campaign issue heading into next year 's congressional midterm elections			1
@entity36 , a spokeswoman for the @entity37 , declined to discuss enrollment specifics in responding to the @entity0 report , which cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter			2
" we can not confirm these numbers , " @entity36 said			0
" more generally , we have always anticipated that initial enrollment numbers would be low and increase over time , just as was the experience in @entity45 , where only 0.3 percent , or 123 people paying premiums , enrolled in the first month , " she said of a similar program set up in the @entity45			0
" and , as we have said , the problems with the website will cause the numbers to be lower than initially anticipated , " @entity36 said			0
the administration has said it will release official data later this week			0
a senior administration official , speaking on the condition of anonymity to @entity56 , said the numbers reported by the @entity0 were not official and that final official data for the first month of open enrollment is not ready yet			1
the @entity0 's figure is pegged to " 834 transmissions " received by insurance companies to complete enrollments			2
it reported private health plans had received federal enrollment information for 40,000 to 50,000 users			0
@entity69 , the official charged with implementing @entity4 as director of the @entity71 , told congressional lawmakers last week the administration had hoped to enroll 800,000 on the insurance exchanges by the end of november			2
that figure would presumably include both the exchanges run by the federal government and those run independently in 14 states and the @entity81			0
it is not clear if it also included enrollments for a large expansion of @entity86 meant to provide insurance to more low - income @entity88			0
a @entity56 analysis of publicly available data from the states with @entity4 exchanges showed 59,441 people had enrolled as of a week ago			2
at least 344,808 people have signed up online for coverage through @entity4 's state - run insurance marketplace but have not yet technically completed the enrollment process			1
this figure does not include paper applications or those submitted over the phone .			0
