@entity0 -- the @entity2 says registration records for as many as one - third of all private aircraft are out - of - date and inaccurate , and has begun the process of re-registering aircraft in the @entity7 -- a task made more urgent by the threat posed by criminals and terrorists			1
of the 357,000 registered aircraft in the @entity7 , records for about 119,000 are believed to be out of date , with many of them believed to be junked or inactive aircraft , the @entity2 said			1
but the inaccurate records also could conceal criminal or even terrorist activity , say some security and aviation experts , who say it is critical that the @entity2 restore order to its records			1
to deal with the disarray , the @entity2 is in the process of canceling registration for all civil aircraft -- a category that includes virtually everything except military aircraft -- and requiring the owners to re-register			1
the re-registrations will be phased - in over three years , and aircraft owners will be required to renew the registrations every three years thereafter			2
" these improvements will give us more up - to - date registration data and better information about the state of the aviation industry , " @entity2 administrator @entity37 said in july , when the rule took effect			1
the @entity2 has long grappled with getting a handle on its records , in recent years requiring owners to report the sale of aircraft , the scrapping or destruction of aircraft , or a change in mailing address			1
but many owners have not complied with those requirements , the @entity2 said			1
and many aircraft owners do not voluntarily update the database with other information , it said			0
the @entity2 's database identifies each aircraft by its registration number -- or " n " number , which is displayed on the plane 's tail or fuselage -- its complete description , and the name and address of its registered owner			1
in seeking to upgrade the requirement three years ago , the @entity2 noted that various levels of law enforcement use the database in drug smuggling investigations and " their efforts now have expanded to include matters of homeland security			2
" proper records can assist investigators , aviation and security			0
authorities routinely check the " n " number , or tail number , of suspicious planes , or planes that have entered restricted airspace			0
just as importantly , an accurate database can help the @entity2 notify aircraft owners of safety - related information , such as @entity95			1
the incomplete records are a security concern , but probably not a security problem , " said @entity96 , a spokesman for the @entity97			0
" most of these planes are probably right where they 're supposed to be			0
the @entity2 has just lost track of them through lost paperwork or the database not being updated or the owners not answering the triennial survey that the @entity2 sends out , " @entity96 said			2
" so they 're probably where they are supposed to be -- owned by the people the @entity2 last has record of			2
they just do n't know that			0
" @entity96 said most aircraft owners recognize the need for accurate records , and that @entity97 has tried to minimize the inconveniences associated with re-registration			2
" we offered some suggestions when the ( new requirement was proposed ) to try to make it a little less burdensome			0
but the fact of the matter is that the database is woefully out of date			0
it does need to be brought up to date			0
we thought it could be done without canceling current registrations			0
the @entity2 decided canceling was the best way			1
it 's now the law of the land , " he said .			0
