-- facebook users , mark my words : you 'll revolt when the site rolls out its new features in the coming weeks			0
@entity7 is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website 's biggest redesign so far , and only a fraction of the website 's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue			1
i 'm not talking about the new real - time " @entity17 " at the top right of your @entity7 profile			1
i 'm not even talking about the " @entity21 " that now appear at the top of your @entity7 news feed -- those are tiny , insignificant changes compared to what 's just around the corner			2
but boy , did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements			0
among my @entity7 friends , more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit			2
of course , they did no such thing			0
how will they react when @entity7 throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely new ? if you use @entity7 , chances are you 're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month ( full disclosure : @entity43 is one of several news organizations partnering with @entity7 on a social news app )			1
only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched @entity7 's 90 - minute announcement of the new profile pages last week			1
and an even smaller percentage of @entity7 users have discovered , like i did , that you can enable the new " @entity54 " profile page right now so you 're prepared for the launch			1
so what 's the big change ? @entity7 will be switching profile pages , perhaps optionally at first , to a new format called " @entity54			1
" i switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- i immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format			2
i 'm someone who thrives on trying new things , but this change was radical even for me			1
yet i could find no way to switch my profile back , so i stuck with it for a few days			2
i 'm so glad i did : @entity54 is the best change @entity7 has ever made			1
here 's what 'll happen once the timeline profiles are launched : your @entity7 profile will go from having one central column to two , with boxes of text , photos , videos and even maps of your favorite locations			1
rather than just displaying your most recent activities , your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life , all the way back to your birth			1
@entity7 will become a record of your existence : all your memories , your victories and your defeats , your loves , your losses and everything in between			2
you 'll be shocked , as i was , when this change is made			0
suddenly your life is laid out before you , the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by @entity7 's algorithms			1
you 'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now , and where all your most recent updates went			0
you 'll add a big , new " @entity112 photo " to your page and waste a few hours preening your timeline , choosing to feature your happiest memories , hide the inconsequential ones , and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments			0
and you 'll realize , as i did , that @entity7 knows you better than you know yourself			2
through this process , you 'll realize that @entity54 is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence			0
while a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning , or what time you left for work , or where you had lunch , @entity54 takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events , discards the irrelevant ones , finds the most emotive , the most visual , the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus			0
much like our memories , @entity54 understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years			0
it 's a marvel of computer programming : an algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory ; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response			0
so yes , you will hate the new @entity7 profile when it launches in the coming weeks			1
then , like me , you 'll realize that @entity7 has unleashed something so remarkable that you did n't even recognize it at first : a meaningful social network			0
and like any other groundbreaking technology -- the pc , the smartphone , the @entity144 -- you 'll wonder why life was n't always this way , and how you got by without it .			0

@entity7 is about to completely change the way its profile pages look
@entity152 : i thrive on new things , but this change was radical even for me
your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life , all the way back to birth
