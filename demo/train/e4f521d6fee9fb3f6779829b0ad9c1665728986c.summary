@entity0 , @entity1 -- a strong wind blows across the @entity4			2
a tornado is on its way and the @entity8 flag on the great lawn waves fiercely			0
i am sitting in an enormous tree with @entity12 on one of the many hunting perches scattered around his @entity1 ranch			1
this is @entity17 , named after his wife of more than 20 years			0
@entity20 , deer , wild turkey and blackbuck antelope roam the 300 - acre property			2
during hunting season they are all fair game			0
@entity12 sits up there for hours , he says , sometimes with a gun but often with a bow and arrow , waiting for the right moment when he can kill his prey with a single shot through the heart and lungs			1
as we sit , he draws back an imaginary bow , speaking slowly and rhythmically , describing " the mystical flight of the arrow			0
" then he lets the imaginary arrow fly			0
to him hunting is " @entity43 in its definitive form , plus you get meat out of it , " he says , laughing			0
@entity12 is spiritually connected to this land			1
" can you feel it ? can you feel it ? " he asks excitedly			0
at home with the @entity12 , @entity12 the platinum - selling rocker and @entity55 board member has invited us to his ranch to understand hunting , self - defense and the @entity61 right to bear arms from the perspective of law - abiding gun - owners			1
after setting up targets on a makeshift shooting range , he hands me a semi-automatic rifle , similar to the one used by the gunman at @entity71 to kill 26 people			0
@entity73 stands for @entity76 rifle not assault rifle , @entity12 explains , blaming the shooter , not the gun itself			1
" it 's not the weapons			0
the weapons had nothing to do with it			0
these weapons are in every pickup in @entity1			0
people have to get past the hardware , " says @entity12 , pointing out that a pheasant shotgun in the wrong hands can be as deadly			1
talk back : should @entity12 attend @entity90 ? he ca n't seem to understand why people who disagree with him wo n't or ca n't see it that way			1
he sticks to his message with a rocker 's flair for hyperbole and provocation			0
" there is no gun violence , " he says			1
" there is only criminal violence and they use an assortment of tools			1
" he rattles off statistics to support his argument : more people killed by drunken drivers , more people drowned			0
when i point out that a deranged 20 - year - old like the @entity113 shooter is unlikely to round up first - graders and drown them , he quiets down			2
" understood , " he nods			0
then without missing a beat , @entity12 picks up the thread of his argument			2
" the gun owners of @entity119 are causing no problem			1
let 's go after the mentally deranged who are doing all these vicious crimes			2
let 's go after the recidivistic maggots that judges and prosecutors unleash into our neighborhoods			0
" opinion : @entity131 , stop trying to appease unfair critics as we drive around his ranch in an all - terrain vehicle , @entity12 stops at various points to restock his feeders as a supplement for the animals that he says breed year - round			1
i ask whether his opinion on guns would change if someone in his family were killed			2
not surprisingly , he says " no , " calling guns a " wonderful tool " for self - defense , competition and sport			1
@entity12 is among the harshest critics of president @entity131 ( " not a hunting buddy " ) , attorney general @entity151 and any lawmaker who would restrict his or any citizen 's access to guns			1
he laughs off as @entity157 and ridiculous the notion that no one wants to take @entity8 ' guns away			2
he supports background checks for new guns and for licensed gun show dealers but rejects gun registration , gun licensing , private sale background checks and limiting access to any existing firearms , saying people who want to ban access to certain types of weapons know almost nothing about guns			2
though @entity12 understands the nation 's desire to stop another gun massacre , he says focusing on criminals and those with mental illnesses will have a bigger impact than trying to ban the more than 310 million guns or billions of high capacity magazines that currently exist in @entity119			1
as for high capacity magazines , @entity12 says limiting bullets is counter to the @entity61 right to self - defense , " when i 'm being assaulted at my home , i and i alone , by any consideration whatsoever , will determine how many bullets i need to protect my family			1
" @entity131 still backs new gun ban ; top senator less certain @entity2 senior producer @entity193 contributed to this report			1

@entity204 : " there is no gun violence , " he says . " there is only criminal violence "
guns , he says , are a " wonderful tool " for self - defense , competition and sport
