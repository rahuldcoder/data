-- i was recently diagnosed with brain cancer			1
sitting across from a doctor holding a clinical folder with your name on it , and hearing him say the words " low - grade glioma , " " language and comprehension areas of your brain , " " surgery " and " chemotherapy " is a very weird experience			1
my first idea was to seek other opinions			0
maybe this hospital is wrong			0
maybe there are other places that would n't need to do surgery			1
maybe there is a laser , a chemical , an ancient tradition , a shaman , a scientist , a nanorobot			0
i felt incomplete about the way that the medical system was handling my situation			1
being " diseased " is like a state of suspended life			0
can i work ? have fun ? be creative ? not really			0
when you are declared " diseased , " you become a set of medical records , therapy , dosages , exam dates			1
it 's as if you disappear , replaced by your disease			0
i immediately asked for my clinical records in digital format , and left the hospital			1
@entity49 : a new understanding of cancer my main objective -- the best thing i felt that i could do -- was to make my digital information available on the @entity55 , in formats that would allow people of multiple cultures , skills , professions and inclinations to access , use , recombine and redistribute it			1
why would i want them to access this information ? to help me find the best cure for myself , and in the process to produce substantial social change by redefining the word " cure			1
" but when i went home to publish my medical records , all i could do was send them to specialized professionals , either by duplicating the cds and mailing them or by copying their closed format and uploading them somewhere			1
i had no direct access to my own information , since i use @entity82 and @entity83 rather than the files ' @entity85 - based viewer			2
as a software engineer , i found software and programming tools to hack the files and make them open -- but a nontechnical person would have difficulty making use of their own medical data			2
i needed , first of all , something which i could easily share , maybe allowing people to open it from their browsers , or even from their smartphones			2
@entity49 : new strategy in war on cancer so i opened up my medical records and converted the data into multiple formats : spreadsheets , databases , metadata files in @entity111 and video , image and sound files			1
and i published them on @entity116			0
the responses have been incredible			0
more than 200,000 people have visited the site and many have provided videos , poems , medical opinions , suggestions of alternative cures or lifestyles , personal stories of success or , sadly , failures -- and simply the statement , " i am here			1
" among them were more than 90 doctors and researchers who offered information and support			1
the geneticist and @entity49 fellow @entity137 has offered to sequence the genome of my tumor after surgery -- in an open - source platform , of course			2
and the @entity144 parliament has been debating a motion to make all patients ' medical records more open and accessible , which would be amazing progress in my country			1
within one day i also heard from two different doctors , who recommended similar kinds of surgery			2
the first version is " awake surgery , " which monitors the brain in real time as different parts are touched			1
the second is a variation in which electrodes are placed on the brain during surgery , and then a brain map is produced ( with the patient awake ) and used during a second surgery ( with the patient fully unconscious )			1
@entity49 : your genes are not your fate existing portals and websites that allow patients and ex-patients to exchange stories and opinions already exist			0
but we 're talking about something different			0
i see a cure as a dynamic process , in which multiple doctors , professionals , artists , scientists and others join as a society -- to converse , support each other , be open to various contributions and shape solutions that merge humanity , technology , technique , philosophy and art. creativity and " normal life " become part of the process and bring " diseased " people back to life			1
to me , a true cure is complete , is human , and has dignity			2
such a cure is a dialogue in which " experts " maintain their status -- and in fact , an enormous thank you goes out to all the extremely qualified professionals who are constantly responding to my calls -- but the whole process opens up to possibility			2
@entity49 : the potential of regenerative medicine and this is exactly what is happening : we are creating a cure by uniting the contributions of surgeons , homeopaths , oncologists , @entity224 doctors , nutritionists and spiritual healers			2
the active participation of everyone involved -- both experts and ex-patients -- is naturally filtering out any damaging suggestion which might be proposed			0
to achieve this kind of cure , we must be open to strategies from different cultures and philosophical orientations			2
and we must embrace a wider , more profound discourse about the ways in which information circulates digitally			0
for now , i 'm following a complex strategy developed with the help of a series of doctors and experts who responded to my open - source cure site and have suggested a variety of therapies to deal with the disease			1
as of now , my cancer growth has stopped			0
we are waiting for the next test results to decide when and if to proceed to surgery			0
how can you be involved ? tell us about excellent techniques and technologies from around the world that can effectively confront low - grade glioma			0
we have explored many opinions in @entity144 and @entity260 , but fewer outside			0
share your stories and experiences , the solutions you have found , the fraud you have encountered			0
send us videos , poems , images , audio or text that you see as relevant to a scenario in which art and creativity can help form a complete and ongoing cure			0
or tell us , " i am here ! " -- alive and connected , ready to support a fellow human being			0
