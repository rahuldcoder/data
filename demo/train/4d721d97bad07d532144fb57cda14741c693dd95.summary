a man who says he was molested by @entity1 has filed a private criminal complaint in @entity3 , trying to force prosecutors to reopen their investigation into the former coach and take him , once again , to trial			1
the man , who we 're calling @entity9 , told his story to @entity11			1
" a big part of the healing process is to face your accuser , " he said			2
@entity9 said @entity1 molested him in 1988 when he was a junior in high school			1
he was a top recruit in football and baseball who was being sought by several schools , and decided to attend a weeklong football camp at @entity21			0
there , he met @entity1 , and said that he was molested twice by the then - defensive coordinator : once in the showers in the assistant coaches locker room and once in @entity1 's office			1
both places are well known to investigators as places where other victims were abused several times			2
the showers in particular were a main setting and focal point of @entity1 's trial			1
it 's in those showers that at least four of @entity1 's victims claim to have been abused , and it 's the place where former assistant coach @entity41 said he witnessed @entity1 abusing a different boy in 2001			1
by january 1989 , @entity9 said his life of promise had spiraled into one of vices he could n't shake , which he blames on the abuse			1
" from drinking and drugging , destruction , confusion , anger and rage , " he said			0
" one episode triggers another one and it becomes an everlasting nightmare			0
" in his 20s , he racked up a rap sheet that included drug and theft charges , and later a killing that he pleaded down to manslaughter			0
all those years , he never told a soul that @entity1 had touched him , until november 2011 , as @entity1 's arrest in other cases was making national headlines and leading news coverage for days			1
he watched from his jail cell where he was serving time on a parole violation and decided to call his lawyer			1
within days , he said , investigators from the @entity3 state attorney general 's office showed up and conducted a four - hour interview , during which he drew a diagram of the football facilities that his lawyers say police found to be credible			0
even though his story , he said , was initially verified by police , it was n't part of the original case of 10 boys against @entity1			1
instead , it was shelved for the possibility of a " round two " prosecution that was not pursued because @entity1 is serving a de facto life sentence ; at age 68 he was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for 45 counts of child sexual abuse			1
" they told me that i would be part of the second criminal trial the following year , but they never had a second trial , " @entity96 said			2
" what we 're asking for is his day in court against @entity1 , " said @entity9 's attorney , @entity102 , in @entity103			1
" it 's not unusual for victims to take this avenue to want to proceed criminally against a person who effectively has a life sentence			2
a victim has their right to a day in court			0
a crime was committed against him			0
" @entity1 's attorney , @entity115 , declined to comment on @entity9 's allegations			1
@entity102 said he believes it 's up to the attorney general 's office whether it pursues another criminal case , but @entity102 said it 's important to victim x , who was an aspiring athlete , to finally face his abuser			0
@entity125 , a spokeswoman for the @entity3 attorney general 's office , told @entity11 that while the statute of limitations may have run out in @entity9 's case , the office is " talking to the victim 's attorney and the district attorney and working through the issues together because of the importance of the case			2
" more than 30 victims in total have come forward , although 10 cases were tried			0
most of the victims have settled with @entity21 , but a few have refused to settle and victim x is one of them			0
he and his family said they did n't feel @entity21 's settlement offer was fair , given the fact that three university officials have been charged with knowing about abuse in 1998 and in 2001 , and not doing enough to stop it			2
the man and his family said that if @entity1 's crimes had been properly reported earlier , his abuse would have been discovered far sooner , and his case would have fallen within the civil statute of limitations			1
now , 26 years later , it does not , and they are in a weaker bargaining position for a monetary settlement			0
they are also upset that no official from @entity21 ever attended a meeting with them or apologized			0
@entity165 , who was hired on the university 's behalf to settle with victims , was the only person to meet with the family			0
@entity170 officials declined to comment on @entity9 's case			2
" the main point for me is coming forward and learning how to live with it on a day - to - day basis , " he said			0
" i do n't want to hide anything			0

" @entity9 " says @entity1 abused him when he was a junior in high school
man says abuse caused his life to spiral into one of vices he could n't shake
he wants @entity1 , who is serving time after other abuse cases , to face trial in this one
