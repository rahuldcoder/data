-- the pitch reads : " would you know if an odorless , colorless and tasteless rape drug were put in your drink ? what if your cup , straw or glass changed color to warn you ? " the pitch comes from a group of people who 've put their minds together to work toward developing a cup and straw that will change color in the presence of date - rape drugs			1
when substances like @entity22 , ketamine and @entity24 touch the surface of the drinkware , they will turn into the designated color used to detect the drug , alerting you to its presence			0
in a video posted to @entity34 to promote a funding campaign , @entity32 founder @entity31 said the idea came from a bad experience where he was once " roofied " -- referring to @entity24 , a sedative -- while out drinking with friends			1
" within the past three years , three of my very close friends , and myself , have been the unwitting victims of being drugged			0
" he added , " @entity32 's ultimate goal is to use the success of this campaign to convince bars , clubs and colleges to make @entity32 the new safety standard and eventually make drug - facilitated sexual assault a crime of the past			1
" @entity31 says of his experience : he was at a club in @entity54 celebrating a friend 's birthday and went to get a drink and then " felt like i had 15 drinks			1
luckily , friends were able to get me home safely			0
" afterward , he went to @entity60 , professor of chemistry at @entity61 , where @entity31 had attended college , with his idea to create a detection system			2
after about two years of research , a prototype was launched in the funding campaign			1
the @entity54 - based company started a campaign on @entity70 in november 2012 with hopes to raise $ 50,000			1
the monthlong campaign resulted in more than 2,500 contributors surpassing their $ 50,000 goal and getting the company one step closer to making the product a reality			1
and @entity31 is a finalist in the @entity78 , an annual $ 1 million startup competition and accelerator program that helps entrepreneurs get access to mentors , marketing and other resources			0
over the next few months , drink straws and , possibly , cups that can detect the anesthetic ghb will be sent out to the people who financially supported the campaign to get feedback			2
@entity31 says the company also has done tests to detect @entity24 and the anesthetic ketamine , and expects to roll out cups and straws that will detect all three drugs in early to mid- 2014			1
at that point the products will also be available on the company 's website			0
watch a prototype demonstration on @entity34 one of the company 's main goals is to get its products in bars and in the hands of college students			2
@entity31 says they are in discussion with several colleges to make this new technology part of their rape - prevention initiatives			2
he said he is well aware that his company 's products wo n't solve all the sexual assault problems , telling @entity0 " this is not 100 % fool - proof , it 's not a cure - all			2
" according to a 2007 study for the @entity121 , only a small fraction ( 2.4 % ) of female undergraduate students who were sexually assaulted were certain or suspected they were incapacitated after having been given a drug without her knowledge			0
the @entity128 notes that alcohol is the chief concern : " for rape which takes place on campuses , alcohol is being used in 90 % of cases			0
" a pilot program is set to take place at a bar in @entity54 in either december or january			0
as for cost , @entity32 says prices will be competitive with what the bars already pay for cups and straws .			0

@entity54 - based company devises cups and straws that can detect date - rape drugs
with the help of a chemistry professor , the company came up with a prototype
@entity32 's funding campaign helped raise more than $ 50,000
founder @entity31 hopes to roll out *completed* products in early to mid- 2014
