@entity0 -- @entity2 is the fourth president of @entity3 , a nation still very much living in the shadow of a brutal decade - long civil war that only ended in 2002			1
he came to power in a wave of exuberance , promising to transform a country still scarred by civil war			1
since then , the former ceo has gone hard on the message that his country is open for business to foreign investors			2

we have some that are not educated , some that are not skilled			0

the issue is not only to create jobs for them but to make them competitive and to make them earn wages that will guarantee them a future			0
@entity1 : for a lot of people , when they hear @entity3 they wonder about the diamonds			1
they wonder about whether or not the idea of a ' blood diamond ' is something of the past			0
what do you say to that ? @entity50 : yeah the issue of the blood diamond is an issue of the past			0
and this was when the war was raging , and before the war			2
but now we have put in place new mining act controls to regulate the mining sector			0

and it is creating employment for the people and it is increasing revenue generation for the country			2
@entity1 : what would you say has been the progress so far on getting corruption out of the government ? @entity50 : we have made substantial progress -- we have now put in place the @entity111 which has given anti-corruption [ officials ] the independence that is required , by giving them the authority to prosecute anybody that they believe is found wanting -- and i have also in the broadcast to the nation , and on many occasions , made it clear that nobody is protected , not even a member of my family			2
@entity1 : do we see people feeling safer in @entity3 ? do you yourself feel safe when you 're out ? @entity50 : i believe i am one of the presidents that drives around without any security			1
i drive around in the streets and people know that i am moving around and they yell , they wave			0
you can drive at any time , at any location in the country without any hit - and - runs			1
that is how safe the country is			2

i must say that it has not improved as much as we want but we are making progress			0
there are ambassadors that are women , we have heads of companies in the country that are women , chairpersons			0
it is growing and becoming very interesting			0
@entity1 : what do you hope your legacy will be for @entity3 ? @entity50 : a @entity3 that has changed from a post-conflict humanitarian rehabilitated country to a country that has taken off on the path of real growth , and i want to be remembered as the person that led the business for the new economic growth of @entity3			1
