-- there are things one has come to expect in @entity3 -- cold winters , sweltering summers , and walking fast through throngs of tourists			1
now composting ? as you may have heard , @entity8 set a goal to achieve zero waste by 2020 ; that means sending nothing to the landfill			1
thanks to the efforts of our businesses , residents , commuters , schools , city agencies and tourists , our city diverts 80 % of all waste from landfill disposal through source reduction , reuse , and recycling and composting programs			1
@entity3 's announcement to require residents to separate food scraps for collection to be composted by 2016 is a laudable and achievable goal			1
since the implementation of @entity8 's mandatory recycling and composting ordinance , composting collection has increased by more than 50 % within three years			1
we went from collecting 400 tons daily to more than 600 tons daily			0
a thriving composting and recycling effort in @entity8 has not only been good for the environment , but also good for the economy			1
according to the @entity46 @entity45 , recycling creates nearly five times as many jobs as sending material to a landfill			1
a study from the @entity52 also states that if we increased our recycling rate to 75 % , 2.3 million jobs would be created nationwide			0
decreasing the amount of refuse the city is sending to the landfill is also helping @entity8 reduce our carbon footprint			2
waste sent to a landfill produces methane , a greenhouse gas that is up to 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide			0
that 's why mayor @entity65 's decision to begin a composting program this year in @entity3 is music to the ears of those of us in the zero waste movement			1
composting has been key to increasing our diversion rate			0
as @entity3 and other cities roll out their composting collection efforts , there are some lessons learned from the road to zero waste in @entity8 to share			1
set a goal : by creating a goal , such as doubling your composting rate , city leaders are able to communicate a vision of success			2
our own @entity89 have embraced a zero waste goal , and diverted more than 80 % of stadium discards from the landfill in last fall 's playoff games			1
celebrate your incremental successes toward that goal to build momentum			0
make composting simple : conduct outreach to your businesses and residents to determine the steps needed to make composting easy			2
we found out that providing residents with free kitchen composting pails as well as providing commercial recycling and composting training were two easy ways to get the community engaged and participating			0
teach the next generation : educating young @entity112 about what goes in the green composting bin has helped not only increase the composting rates in our schools , zero waste education has helped raise awareness about protecting nature and understanding the source of food			2
success does not happen overnight			0
behavior change is hard business			0
in @entity8 , when recycling and composting was mandated , we experienced some initial resistance because of the " ick " factor : the idea that composting could be foul smelling and belongs on a farm , not in a city			1
overcoming these misconceptions is as easy as reminding people that compostables have been in your kitchen trash can all along			0
now , you are separating out your coffee grounds , food scraps , soiled paper and dead flowers and putting them toward a good cause			0
in @entity8 our good cause is wine and fresh produce			0
@entity8 has collected more than a million tons of food scraps , yard trimmings , and other compostable materials and turned it into nutrient rich compost that is in demand by local farmers and wineries in @entity160 and @entity161 counties			2
can @entity3 compost ? without a doubt			2
by setting up an easy to use system , investing in teaching @entity3 what goes in the compost bin and celebrating incremental successes , @entity3 will be well on its way to making composting second nature , too			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

mayor @entity65 in @entity3 wants people to compost . is that even possible ?
@entity172 : @entity8 has thriving composting program , goal to send nothing to landfill by 2020
@entity172 's *advice* to @entity3 : get people over the ick factor , set goals , teach , make it simple
composting , recycling creates jobs and substantially reduces waste to landfill , she says
