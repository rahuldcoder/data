-- explorer @entity1 found an island nearly two years ago near @entity4			1
fishermen pass by @entity4 's @entity7 fjord in this september 2004 picture			2
such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity , even wonder perhaps , but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer			2
the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to @entity4 by an ice shelf or a glacier			2
but such a large amount of ice melted , it revealed the distinct island			2
" i very quickly realized two things , " he told @entity0 's @entity22 during a visit to the island earlier this year			2
" one [ was ] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change			2
" " the other thing was that it meant it was really happening			2
it was n't a joke			2
it was n't just statistics			2
" he calls his discovery @entity37			0
many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the @entity44 's climate are the result of an increase in the world 's temperature , a trend widely called global warming			1
many global warming experts say the phenomenon , if unchecked , is capable of altering the world 's climate and geography			1
in the worst - case scenario , experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels , flooding cities and altering seashores			1
other scientists and observers , a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous , say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet 's life			1
most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere			1
but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious			0
the @entity44 's temperature averages about 60 degrees @entity81 ( about 16 degrees @entity82 )			1
the average surface temperature has warmed one @entity84 ( 0.6 degrees @entity82 ) during the last century , according to the @entity85			1
the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 , according to the @entity88 @entity87			1
they rose till about 1945 , cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day			0
there are several possible reasons for the warming , scientists say			1
a change in the @entity44 's orbit or the intensity of the sun 's radiation could change , triggering warming or cooling			1
the reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet 's temperature at a comfortable level			1
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , for instance , has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age , according to the @entity118 ' @entity117 , commonly referred to as the @entity117			0
the presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels , but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades , according to the @entity87			0
meanwhile , nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years			1
many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels , emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests			1
" for the last 30 years , there 's no way there 's anything natural that can explain it , " @entity137 , a professor of environmental studies at @entity139 in @entity140 , said			1
" a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming , " he added			1
many scientific organizations share @entity137 's view , ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the @entity157 to the @entity85 , the @entity158 and the @entity159			0
but there are those who do not share his view , and among the skeptics is @entity164 , a professor of atmospheric sciences at the @entity166			0
" we 've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves , " he said			0
" when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 , we were proclaiming global cooling			1
since then , there 's been a few tenths of global warming , so we 're proclaiming global warming			1
" he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability , where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal			1
" the @entity44 is always getting colder and warmer , " he said			1
" it 's always changing			0
in fact , this is true of any fluid - covered planet			0
" asked about glacial melt , which many observers point to as evidence of global warming , @entity164 said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained			1
" we do n't know why , but it 's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they 've occurred , " he said			2
" what we 're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that 's occurring due to global warming			2
" yet , for @entity137 , it is a cause for concern and alarm			0
" we 're already in serious melt , nobody can explain it			0
the models do n't predict it , " he said			0
" we do n't know what 's going on up there			0
all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty			0
" the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world 's nations			0
the @entity117 in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels , temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees @entity81 ( 2 to 4.5 degrees @entity82 ) by 2100			1
the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes , droughts , wildfires and flooding , @entity137 said			0
the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of @entity237 filmmakers			0
uncertainties , however , plague such forecasts , which are based on computer simulations and models			0
the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere , oceans and continents interact , all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them			0
" exactly how much it 's going to warm up , we do n't know , " @entity137 said			0
" that it 's going to warm up ? i 'd bet anything on that			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity44 has warmed one degree in past 100 years
majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise
some *critics* say planets often in periods of warming or cooling
