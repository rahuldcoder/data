-- when @entity2 speaks people listen			1
the @entity4 double olympic gold medalist , who won the 10,000 meter title at four consecutive @entity6 between 1993 and 1999 , knows talent when he sees it			1
so when @entity2 labeled @entity9 sprinter @entity8 " a bundle of talent who has a very bright future because he is ready to learn , " people began to sit up and take notice			1
most of all @entity8 himself , who as the fastest sprinter in @entity9 is determined to emulate @entity2 's success			1
" i want people to be hearing my name , i 'd love to be famous , " @entity8 told @entity0 's human to @entity18			1
" i 'm thinking of a way to develop my name and sports can help me achieve this			0
i want to let the whole world know that i exist			0
" father figure @entity27 and @entity2 's paths crossed at the @entity28 , which @entity8 says is " all about helping the young athletes to develop their talent through financial back - ups			1
" the pair recently spent time together in the @entity4 capital of @entity34 where they hope to inspire the next generation of athletes			0
but while hundreds of children watched on in awe it was @entity8 who was starstruck by @entity2 -- a man he describes as a father - like figure			1
" because of his inspirational talks i 'm able to withstand the challenges on the track -- he gives me fatherly advice , " said @entity8			1
" he has made me understand that to become a great person in track and field or even in sports in general , you have to train your mind to cope with pressure			0
" if you can not handle the pressure then i do n't think you can have the qualities to become a champion			0
" i could tell that he was able to deal with the pressure and that 's why he set so many records			2
to have him as my mentor is a great thing and will always live in my memory			0
" bolt while most athletes would dream of having just one mentor with the experience and success of @entity2 , @entity27 is in the enviable position of having two -- and the second one is n't too bad either			1
" @entity79 is lovely , " @entity8 said of the world 's fastest man			1
" he 's the kind of person everyone would like to be , to be where he is			2
" because he 's generous , he does n't discriminate , he does n't really show that he 's a champion , he does n't scare people away from him			2
" he always wants people to be close to him			0
he plays a lot , if you 're a champion or if you 're not a champion , he recognizes everybody			0
" @entity89 's @entity79 , a six - time olympic gold medalist , is regarded as one of the finest sprinters in history as well as one of the most charismatic athletes on the circuit			1
but behind his bravado and confident streak is a man who is desperate to help his fellow competitors , according to @entity8			1
" @entity79 made my stay wonderful in @entity89 , " he said			1
" @entity79 would always say ' @entity101 , come on , let 's go '			1
" he always remembers how he started			0
he always remembers ' hey , i was once like this guy , so i have to encourage them '			0
" he really does encourage people ; he encourages young people around him to keep what they know best			0
" personal best @entity79 's work with @entity8 has already reaped dividends with the @entity9 producing a season 's best of 10.11 following his time with the @entity114 100 and 200 meter champion			1
the opportunity to work with sprinters and coaches outside of his own country was important to @entity8 , who believes the lack of top training partners in @entity9 has hampered his progress			1
by working in the @entity123 alongside some of the biggest names in athletics such as @entity79 and @entity127 , @entity27 has gained the kind of experience he could never have gained in @entity9			1
" i think training with these guys teaches you how to manage yourself in the competition , " he added			0
" it helps you realize that you should n't fear champions			0
it makes you recognize that one day i 'll be like this guy			0
" if you train with a champion then hopefully you 'll turn out the same way			0
that 's why it was such a great opportunity when i trained with @entity79			1
" new challenge already a champion in his own country , @entity27 is desperate to push the boundaries of his success and challenge the @entity89 and @entity123 in the big tournaments			0
racing against the same athletes within @entity9 no longer holds any appeal nor is it challenging enough -- he 's the big fish in the small pond and that has to change			1
" i 'm the fastest man in @entity9 and everybody 's looking up to me -- they want to beat @entity8 , " he said			1
" i 'm unbeaten in the national trials for the past four years			0
i still need to do a lot of things to do to become a champion			0
my mental target is not to win national trials			0
" it 's no longer any news to me , i do n't call it a victory			2
if i win i do n't celebrate that much			0
" i 'm looking forward to winning a medal at the @entity6 or at the @entity114			1
that 's what i 'm focusing on now			2
" the opportunity to star at the @entity114 began as a far fetched dream			1
it was during his time at school that @entity8 decided to pursue sprinting and attempt to follow in the footsteps of his hero , @entity175			1
@entity175 , an @entity114 bronze medalist and a @entity177 silver medalist , provided the inspiration for @entity8 , who at five years his senior had already become a household name in @entity9			1
the two men came face to face at the national @entity114 trials in 2008 with @entity8 defeating @entity175 and taking the title as @entity9 's fastest man following a thrilling 100 meter contest			1
it was a proud moment for @entity8 , who also won a bronze medal in the 200 meters at the @entity190 as well as a gold medal at the @entity192 in @entity193			1
@entity114 bow that success ensured he arrived at the @entity196 full of confidence -- finishing second in his 100m heat with a time of 10.34 seconds before recording a time of 20.62 in the 200m			1
@entity202 followed in the 4x100m relay -- a nightmare baton exchange led to disqualification and ended any hopes of medal success			2
but that failure failed to dent @entity8 's spirit			1
competing at the @entity114 in @entity210 and then at @entity211 four years later remains a proud achievement -- but is by no means the most important of his life			2
that came when he graduated from the @entity215 , with a degree in @entity217			2
" my greatest achievement is that i 'm an international athlete and a graduate , " he said			0
" it 's something to boast of , because i do n't know about @entity222 countries , but i do know about the @entity101 mentality			2
" they always see sportsmen as people who do n't go to school -- as a nuisance			0
people used to see sportsmen and women as uneducated , people who wasted their time			0
" so i am proud to say , ' ok , i 'm able to combine sports and my educational career and combine them successfully '			2
" every year i 'm counting my achievements			0
it 's not as if winning national trials is the best achievement in track and field			2
" they say that charity begins at home			0
you have to show that you are good in your own country before showing the rest of the world that you are good			0
" family man @entity8 's family were certainly proud of him when he won gold medals in both the 100 and 200m at the @entity250 in @entity251			1
from there he moved on to the very first training camp held by the @entity254 in @entity255 where under the guidance of @entity2 he has flourished			2
his success working alongside the likes of @entity79 and @entity2 has helped @entity27 not just blossom as an athlete , but as a person			1
but there is no doubt in his own mind where the roots of his success stemmed from			0
" i 'm a product of my family			0
my family do not regret they have me in this world , " he said			0
" they say ' ah that 's my son '			2
my mum , brothers and sisters are all proud of me			0
" they say , ' @entity277 , you 're making us proud out there ' and that 's it			2
i think it 's a great achievement for me			0
" perhaps in time he 'll make @entity2 proud too .			2
