-- rail riders along the @entity3 coast and the @entity6 - @entity5 " @entity4 " are set to reap much of the benefits from $ 2 billion that @entity9 policymakers had earlier rejected for high - speed rail development			1
the @entity12 administration on monday announced the reallocated funding , part of its push to spur environmentally friendly transportation and modernize the nation 's infrastructure that 's supported partly by the 2009 economic stimulus package			1
fifteen states and @entity21 will receive the money to back 22 high - speed intercity passenger rail projects			1
among other things , the funds will be used to improve speed and service in the @entity4 , add faster rail lines in the @entity29 and help spur more efficient train service between @entity31 and @entity32			2
nearly $ 300 million will be spent to reduce major delays for trains coming in and out of @entity35 -- the nation 's busiest passenger rail junction			2
within the next four years , high - speed rail advocate @entity38 estimated trains between @entity41 and @entity42 will routinely move at 160 mph because of a host of upgrades aimed at improving " train speeds , capacity and reliability			1
" while billed as new funding , the money actually is previously pledged funds being directed to new recipients			0
soon after taking office , @entity9 gov. @entity52 cited expected cost overruns and long - term operating costs for his call to block federal funding for an 84 - mile - long high - speed rail line that would link @entity59 and @entity60			1
days after the @entity9 @entity63 issued a ruling that allowed the @entity66 government to reject the federal money , the @entity62 @entity61 opened up a process to solicit fresh bids from other states and entities			1
it is all part of the $ 53 billion that the @entity73 has proposed spending over the next six years to promote high - speed rail -- an initiative facing a chilly reception in the @entity66 - controlled @entity78			1
" president @entity12 and i made a commitment to improve and expand @entity83 's transportation system , " vice president @entity79 said in a statement			2
these new investments " will continue our progress toward making this vision a reality			0
" @entity79 , a regular @entity21 commuter between his home state of @entity90 and @entity5 during his 36 years in the @entity91 , is known as a leading supporter of federally supported rail travel			0
transportation secretary @entity94 , on hand at @entity41 's @entity96 for the announcement , insisted the funds will " help states across the country create jobs , spur economic development and boost manufacturing in their communities			0
" @entity12 said in january 's @entity105 that he was setting a goal of giving 80 % of @entity62 access to high - speed rail within 25 years			1
the stimulus act has provided about $ 10.1 billion toward @entity12 's goal so far , according to the @entity61			1
" by 2050 , the @entity62 will be home to 100 million additional people -- the equivalent of another @entity3 , @entity113 , @entity41 and @entity9 combined , " @entity94 noted			2
" we simply can not build enough highways and airports to accommodate this growth			0
" supporters insist the emphasis on faster rail transportation is a necessary investment in the country 's economic competitiveness			1
critics contend it 's little more than a massive boondoggle that is contributing to skyrocketing federal deficits while providing few proven benefits over the long term			2
@entity52 's decision this winter to reject what eventually worked out to $ 2 billion in federal funding for the @entity60 - to - @entity59 plan surprised a number of observers			1
this came after the @entity12 administration pulled another $ 1.2 billion in funding from @entity139 and @entity140 after their newly elected @entity66 governors vowed to kill high - speed rail projects that were under way			1
@entity94 portrayed those cases monday as relatively rare exceptions , noting that the @entity61 received $ 10 billion worth of requests for the $ 2 billion available			1
" who says @entity83 does not have a pent - up demand ? " he asked			0
@entity21 officials note that they set a new annual ridership record of more than 28 million passengers for the last fiscal year			0
regardless , the new spending makes little sense at the current time , according to @entity156 , an analyst at the @entity157 , a libertarian - oriented @entity31 - based think tank			0
the administration " seems to be completely deaf to the real concerns about whether this is a well thought out program , " @entity156 told @entity0			0
" there are so many other transportation needs that are going unfunded , including just bring existing transit systems up to a good state of repair			0
" " i do n't see how anyone looking at the numbers can say that high - speed rail is going to be a primary driver of economic growth " in the regions targeted by the new money , @entity156 said			1
" what it will do is supplement the existing transportation network and serve a very targeted niche of that market			0
but it 's not going to be a broad - based transportation solution			0
" @entity38 , the director of the urban planning initiative @entity83 , said she believed critics would continue to target the rail initiative because it is " one of @entity12 's signature initiatives			2
" but she believes such efforts run counter to the needs and wants of policymakers and citizens nationwide who want such infrastructure projects to go forward -- even if that 's not true in @entity9			2
" ( this ) announcement helps to restore public confidence in the program , as we see that many states around the country are ready to put @entity9 's unwanted funding to use , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity12 administration gives out $ 2 billion for high - speed rail projects
new : this comes after @entity9 authorities reject $ 2 billion for an @entity60 - to - @entity59 line
@entity12 wants 80 % of @entity62 to have access to high - speed rail within 25 years
critics contend the project is *wasteful* and will do little to boost economic competitiveness
