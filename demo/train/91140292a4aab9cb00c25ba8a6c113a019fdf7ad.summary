-- @entity1 had the noblest of plans			1
upon winning the then - largest - ever $ 314 million @entity7 jackpot in 2002 , the @entity5 construction company owner said he wanted to pay tithes to the @entity9 , get some of his laid - off workers back on the job and start a charitable foundation			1
he might buy a helicopter , and he 'd definitely pamper his daughter and granddaughter , he said			2
" i 'm not going to buy anything for myself , " he said during a news conference announcing his windfall			2
" the very first thing i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to go home			2
i 'm going to sit down and make out three checks to three pastors for 10 % of this check			0
that 's the very first thing i 'm going to do			2
" already a millionaire via his company , @entity1 predicted the money would n't faze him at all			1
his life , he said , would carry on normally			0
" if i can help it , it 's not going to change			2
i 'm content with my life , " he told reporters			0
" i 'm not going to change my life much			0
" yet by 2007 , barely four years after what should have been the luckiest day of his life , @entity1 was a broken - down man who had lost his granddaughter to drugs and who had a reputation for @entity38 , frequenting strip clubs and getting robbed			1
his divorce would be finalized the following year			0
his daughter would die the next			0
in january 2007 , responding to a complaint that he had n't paid his settlement with a woman who claimed he harassed her at a greyhound track , @entity1 issued a statement to the @entity48 , saying , " on 9 - 11 , a team of crooks went to 12 different ( @entity51 ) cashed 12 ( checks ) and got all my money			1
" " i intend to pay but ca n't without any money , " the statement said			0
@entity1 , of course , is the poster man for lottery winners forced off the tracks , and , certainly , there are many happy lottery winners who took their winnings and quietly went about their lives without so much as another headline in the local newspaper			1
perhaps shockingly , however , about 70 % of those incurring a financial windfall lose that money within a few years , according to the @entity68			0
as we await the name of the person who purchased the winning $ 400 million @entity7 ticket in @entity74 , @entity75 , it 's worth a reminder that sudden fortune is n't the panacea it 's sometimes made out to be			1
not only can seemingly unlimited income stoke temptations to spurn moderation , but lottery winners may also find friends and family members treating them more like a mark than a loved one , said @entity87 , a @entity89 , @entity88 , wealth manager who spoke to @entity0 after the winners of the $ 656 million @entity92 jackpot were announced last year			1
" anytime you 're a public figure , you 're going to attract attention from people who want to take things from you , " he said			0
" most of us would n't be too happy if the amount of our paychecks was in the newspaper			0
self - styled entrepreneurs approach with pitches			2
second cousins come looking for loans			0
friends know someone who can help manage the money			0
" that 's not to say you would n't want to do something nice for those people , but it could become a full - time job , " @entity87 said			1
his advice would be to remain anonymous , but only @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity75 and @entity120 allow winners to avoid state lottery publicity			0
( @entity123 does in certain circumstances , but not for @entity7 or @entity92 winners			0
) thus , @entity87 advises his clients to keep a low profile			1
as @entity128 , associate professor of business administration at @entity130 , told @entity0 in 2011 , " when you become the rich person , who other people look to , it can actually erode the social bond that you have with people because it changes your relationship from friendship into almost like a transaction			0
" what 's the worst that can happen , you ask ? well , @entity1 does n't even provide the worst - case scenario			1
earlier this year , @entity142 , a man described as a successful , hardworking @entity144 immigrant , died of cyanide poisoning the day after collecting $ 425,000 from a scratch - off lottery ticket			1
no arrest has been made			0
@entity149 's own brother reportedly tried to kill him after he won $ 16.2 million in a 1988 @entity151 state lottery game			1
though his brother was imprisoned , @entity153 's reckless spending and behavior left him broke and divorced before he died in 2006 of respiratory failure			1
these are extremes , of course , but there are many cases of lesser tragedies befalling lottery winners			0
there 's the @entity165 man who squandered a 2002 jackpot of 9.7 million pounds , much of it on cocaine and hookers , only to find himself working as garbage man again by 2010			1
and the @entity172 wig maker who won $ 18 million in 1993 , only to spend so lavishly on political and philanthropic causes that she filed for bankruptcy four years later			1
or the @entity178 woman who won the lottery twice -- a grand total of $ 5.4 million -- but was so helpless to avoid games of chance that she ended up in a trailer after giving the lion 's share of her money to @entity187 casinos			1
@entity188 saw spooky signs before he even collected half of his $ 380 million @entity92 prize in @entity88 in 2011 , telling @entity0 that he was reluctant to even come forward because " all we saw were predators and we were afraid to do anything until we got down here with police protection			1
" winning is n't always a curse , though			2
@entity198 of @entity199 , @entity200 , who won $ 5 million in the @entity202 in 2010 , said in an interview the following year that he did n't see any downside to the money			1
he 'd helped his sister with medical bills , handed out money to other relatives , remodeled his home , bought an rv and @entity212 , and invested a large chunk of the cash			0
" i do n't feel that i have changed			0
i am just very secure financially , " he said			0
it 's quite the contrast to @entity1 , and while most lottery winners ' experiences fall somewhere between @entity198 's and @entity1 's , it 's safe to say no one wants to follow the latter 's path post-millions			1
no one should ever have to tell @entity223 , as @entity1 did five years after his windfall , that they 'd be better off without the money			2
" since i won the lottery , i think there is no control for greed , " he told the station			2
" i think if you have something , there 's always someone else that wants it			2
i wish i 'd torn that ticket up			0
" @entity0 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 of @entity5 became a broken - down man after winning $ 314 million
@entity142 died of cyanide poisoning after a $ 425,000 scratch - off win
but @entity249 @entity198 , who won $ 5 million in 2010 , says he 's yet to see a downside
