@entity0 , @entity1 -- to begin with , @entity3 did n't have health insurance			1
plus , it was finals week			0
so his first instinct was to ignore the pain			0
a nurse takes blood from @entity3 , who has leukemia			1
a walk across his apartment convinced him otherwise			0
" my hip was like on fire , grinding " is how he recalled the morning seven months ago that changed everything			0
" i know pain , and i 've never felt that kind of pain before , " @entity18 said			1
at the hospital , a blood test with startling results : a dramatically elevated white blood cell count			0
he had leukemia , at 23			1
@entity18 had no health insurance because he was too old to be covered on his parents ' policy and too young and seemingly healthy to think he needed it			1
so count @entity18 among the estimated 47 million @entity32 who lack health insurance , and as a resident of a state with the highest percentage of uninsured : nearly one in four @entity38 do not have health coverage			1
despite no coverage , he received expert care through the @entity43 , a county hospital that sees 800,000 patients a year , and where fewer than 7 percent of the patients have private health insurance			1
" i have had excellent doctors --- excellent doctors , " @entity18 said			1
" the chemo just wears you down			0
i had to be admitted for five days every time , every three weeks			0
" he is cared for through a hospital program called @entity54 , which is geared to help those without insurance get care --- and to look to see if they are eligible for any government assistance			2
@entity18 initially was put on @entity59 , then at a social worker 's suggestion applied for @entity63 disability payments			1
but after he started receiving them , his @entity59 was cut off because @entity1 is one of a dozen states that counts such payments against its income standards for @entity59			1
" now i have no insurance again , " he said with a sigh			0
" @entity74 " is how @entity71 , the @entity43 ceo , responds when the health care debate in @entity73 is brought up			1
nearly 15 percent of the hospital 's patients are on @entity77 , another 14 percent @entity59			2
most do n't have any coverage			2
so while he backs effort to find a way to cover the millions of uninsured @entity32 , @entity71 and his chief of medicine , dr. @entity82 , said they worry president @entity86 's plan to pay for his effort to overhaul health care , in part , by squeezing billions from @entity77 and @entity59 could do as much or more harm than good			1
" then you either cut services or you cut payments to providers , " @entity82 said			0
" and in @entity1 we have a significant problem with @entity59			1
only 38 percent of our physicians participate in @entity59 programs			0
... so if we start squeezing the payment rates down or freezing them , there are fewer and fewer physicians who will want to participate in those programs			0
" in @entity1 , another major concern is how overhauling health care will deal with the question of providing treatment to illegal immigrants --- a significant slice of the patient population at @entity43 and other public hospitals			1
" i 've never met anyone in this area that is lukewarm on this issue , " @entity71 said			0
" we have over 6,000 births last year , and over 70 percent of them were to an undocumented population			0
that is a population we have to take care of			2
" as for @entity18 , he said he 's optimistic but also waiting to learn from doctors whether he needs to consider a bone marrow transplant			1
" the bone marrow testing alone costs $ 300,000 , " @entity18 told us			2
" and we 're not even talking about the hospital stays			0
that 's just the testing part of it			2
at least that is what i am told			0
" in his apartment , he shows the eight prescription drug vials with his daily medications			0
in the window still hangs an @entity86 - @entity136 campaign sign			0
ask about the politics of health care in @entity73 , and @entity18 's first reflex is to blame @entity140			1
but as the conversation continues , he voices frustration at all the recent @entity145 infighting over how to pay for the overhaul			1
" i think they need to get their heads together , " @entity18 said			2
" because it 's really not just about @entity140 vs. @entity151 anymore , it 's about getting the job done			2
and with those majorities in place , things should be happening , especially if you 're coming from the same types of ideas and backgrounds , there should n't be too much opposition			0
... and if they do n't get it done , there 's going to be a lot of people that are going to be hurting because of it			2

@entity1 @entity3 , who 's uninsured , was *diagnosed* with leukemia at 23
he 's among nearly one in four @entity38 who do not have health coverage
@entity18 may face treatment costing *hundreds* of thousands of *dollars*
he voices frustration on health care debate , says *lawmakers* need to get job done
