@entity0 -- @entity3 's high court is indefinitely suspending all its sessions , after supporters of president @entity6 surrounded the building and blocked judges from entering			1
calling sunday a " dismal , black day " in the history of the country 's judiciary , the court said in a statement that its judges will not return to work until they can do their jobs " without any psychological or physical pressures			1
" " the judges of the @entity22 have no choice but to declare to the great @entity3 people that they are unable to perform their sacred mission in light of the current charged situation , " the statement said , according to the state - run @entity19 news agency			1
it was the latest salvo in a growing crisis that pits @entity6 and his conservative @entity31 allies against liberal , secular opponents , raising fears among observers that the political strife could translate to violence in the streets			0

and at least one person died and 66 were injured saturday in clashes at protests , both for and against the president , according to @entity19			0
sunday 's protest by @entity6 's supporters forced judges to postpone ruling on the legitimacy of the body drawing up the nation 's constitution , and on a separate but related decision about whether to dissolve the @entity60 , @entity3 's upper house of parliament			1
the scheduled court session was widely viewed as a challenge to @entity6 , who set off a political maelstrom on november 22 when he declared his past and future decisions were immune from judicial oversight			2
@entity6 said the powers are necessary and temporary until a new constitution is adopted			2
but that promise has done little to quiet the opposition , which says @entity6 's actions are reminiscent of those taken by ousted president @entity74			2
anger at @entity6 's move led to protesters reoccupying @entity78 , the scene of the @entity81 uprising that saw @entity74 ousted in 2011			1
the anger only grew when the @entity31 - dominated @entity83 pushed through a draft despite the objections of the secular opposition , including some members who walked out in protest			0
but @entity6 and his political allies may have reason to be worried , given steps taken by the the military council that ruled @entity3 after @entity74 's ouster			1
the council has previously dissolved parliament 's lower house , which was populated with a number of @entity31 lawmakers loyal to @entity6 , because it said the elections were unconstitutional			0
when @entity6 said he would call back the lower house , the high court upheld the dissolution			1
on saturday , @entity6 said a constitutional referendum will be held on december 15			0
following the announcement , tens of thousands of protesters -- for and against @entity6 -- took to the streets			0
hundreds of @entity107 and @entity6 supporters spent saturday night outside the court , which had indicated it would review the proposed constitution			1
trucks brought food and blankets to crowds outside , said @entity41 , the @entity42 spokesman			0
opinion : why the @entity117 is a mess protesters had surrounded the building by sunday morning			1
they blocked entrances , " with some of them on top of the walls while chanting slogans that denounce the judiciary and inciting people against the judges , " the court said in its statement sunday			1
it was unclear sunday whether the high court judges would rule on the constitution			1
but beyond the court 's chambers , opinions over the document were split			2
about 1,000 judges from around the country agreed sunday that they would not supervise a national referendum on the constitution , members of the @entity140 said			1
the club 's unanimous decision means court officials who would normally sort out any irregularities in voting will abstain from the process in protest			2
but there were also signs of support for the measure			0
following @entity6 's announcement of the referendum , there was at least one indication that his move signaled progress : the @entity3 stock exchange rose by nearly 5 billion pounds ( $ 8.2 million ) -- 2.5 % -- in 15 minutes following the news of a constitutional referendum			1
@entity167 , a senior @entity6 adviser , has insisted all viewpoints -- including the need to safeguard freedoms when it comes to things like gender and religion -- were taken into account in the drafting of the constitution			0
the constitution 's articles include language dealing with individuals ' civil rights , particularly how security forces and the justice system treat them			2
there is wording prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring due process , a sensitive topic in @entity3			2
@entity74 and his supporters are blamed for jailing and harshly mistreating innocent people in the years before and especially during last year 's uprising			0
while many of the articles sound democratic , the fine print indicates otherwise , some human rights advocates say			0
" moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law , " said @entity201 , deputy @entity117 and @entity204 director at @entity205			0
the preamble includes language pertaining to women , saying they are equal to men , but it also accentuates their role as mothers			0
the @entity219 ' high commissioner for human rights , @entity218 , has urged @entity6 to reconsider the draft , saying a number of measures contained in it are incompatible with international human rights law			0
opponents of @entity6 said they were organizing another round of protests tuesday against the president and his decree			0
the scheduled demonstrations are dubbed " the final warning			0
" @entity231 : what 's driving @entity3 's unrest ? journalist @entity234 and @entity1 's @entity235 contributed to this report .			1
