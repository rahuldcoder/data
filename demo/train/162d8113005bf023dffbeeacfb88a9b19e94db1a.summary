-- three quarters of the world 's poor are living without a bank account , impeded by physical distance from banks and by bureaucratic roadblocks , according to a @entity9 report			1
in a 2011 survey of 150,000 adults in 148 countries , it found that more than 75 % of adults earning less than $ 2 per day are " unbanked " or do not use a formal financial institution			1
of 70,000 respondents without a bank account , 65 % cited not having enough money to use one as the most important reason			1
other top reasons included the cost of opening a bank account being too expensive and a lack of trust in banks			1
" i hope policy makers will use this research to help make sure everyone , everywhere , has access to financial services , " @entity27 of the @entity28 and the @entity31 secretary general 's special advocate for @entity32 said in a news release			2
among regions surveyed , people in the @entity40 and @entity41 have most difficulties , with only 18 % reporting an account			0
in high - income economies , nine out of 10 adults have an account at a formal financial institution			0
being ' unbanked ' is linked to inequalities , according to @entity51			0
the richest 20 % of adults in developing countries are more than twice as likely to have an account as the poorest 20 %			0
also , in developing economies only 37 % of women have a bank account compared with 46 % of men keeping their savings in financial institutions			1
a bank account could enhance economic opportunities among the poor , as saving and borrowing enables them to start a business or invest in education			1
instead , they often rely on money lenders charging high fees , the @entity9 says			0
" providing financial services to the 2.5 billion people who are ' unbanked ' could boost economic growth and opportunity for the world 's poor , " says @entity51 president @entity74			1
mobile banking is becoming a popular alternative to money lenders among the poor , especially in @entity80			0
these money transfers through mobile phones enable them to pay bills or make deposits through a text message without traveling or setting up a formal bank account			2
