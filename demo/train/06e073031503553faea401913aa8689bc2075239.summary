i experienced it in the @entity72 and really appreciated it			0
i think it 's extremely important and we all expect that kind of safety , " she said , before turning her thoughts to the preparations			2
" for many years we were hearing whether everything would be ready or not : whether the the rail stations would be ready , how were the athletes going to go up to the mountains from the @entity85			2
" all those questions raised a lot of concerns , but once i got here i realized that everything would be alright			0
