@entity1 , @entity2 a black - and - white photo shows the 16 - year - old ballerina at her prime , mere months before her world would be destroyed			2
she is dressed in a bathing suit , smiling radiantly while performing a gymnastic split			2
@entity9 says the portrait was taken by her first teenage crush : a @entity13 boy named @entity14			1
he , like so many others , would not survive the @entity17			2
" i had my 17th birthday in @entity19 , " @entity9 says			1
seventy years later , @entity9 appears frail at first glance , until she astounds a new acquaintance by performing a dance kick that goes shoulder - high			1
the 87 - year old says her fondest childhood memories still revolve around dancing and training to compete for the @entity29 @entity28 team as a gymnast			2
" but then i was told that i had to train somewhere else because i 'm @entity13 , and i do not qualify [ for the @entity28 ] , " @entity9 recalls			1
" my dream was totally shattered			2
" @entity9 was a @entity29 jew , the youngest of three daughters , living in a town called @entity34 in what is modern - day @entity36			1
her father was a tailor ; her mother , a civil servant			0
it was n't until march 1944 , late in @entity43 , that @entity9 says @entity29 nazis came to her house and arrested her family			1
the @entity13 in @entity29 were among the last of @entity49 's @entity13 communities to be targeted by the @entity44			0
the family was taken to other internment centers before they were finally loaded into a train and shipped to the @entity19 concentration camp in @entity54 , occupied by @entity55			1
" my mom held me in the cattle car , " @entity9 recalls			1
" and she said , ' we do n't know where we 're going			0
we do n't know what 's going to happen			0
just remember no one can take away from you what you put here in your own mind			0
' " upon arrival at the camp , @entity9 said dr. @entity67 , one of the @entity19 complex 's top medical officers , stood at the end of a line of prisoners deciding who would go to the gas chambers and who would head for the prison barracks			1
" he pointed to my mom to go to the left , and i followed my mom , " @entity9 says			1
" and dr. @entity67 grabbed me -- i never forget that eye contact -- and he said ' you 're going to see you mother soon , she 's just going to take a shower			1
' " it was the last time @entity9 saw her parents			1
they died in the gas chambers of @entity19 along with more than a million other @entity13			1
but that would not be the ballerina 's final encounter with the infamous @entity91 doctor who later became known the " @entity92			0
" " dr. @entity67 came to the barracks and wanted to be entertained , " @entity9 says			1
fellow inmates " volunteered " @entity9 to perform for the man who had ordered her parents ' death			1
she asked her captors to play the @entity99 as she danced for one of the worst war criminals of the @entity17			0
" i was so scared , " @entity9 says			1
" i closed my eyes , and i pretended that the music was @entity104 , and i was dancing ' @entity105 ' in the @entity107 opera house			0
" the @entity109 doctor rewarded the @entity13 girl with an extra ration of bread , which she later shared with the girls in her prison quarters			0
@entity9 says months later , those same girls rescued her when she nearly collapsed from disease and starvation during a forced death march through @entity119			1
" they formed a chair with their arms , and they carried me so i would n't die , " she says , adding , " is n't it important that the worst conditions really brought out the best in us ? " decades after the horrors of the @entity17 , dance is still a passion			2
@entity9 's house on a hill overlooking the @entity133 is decorated with statues of ballerinas			1
every sunday , she says she goes swing - dancing to the music that @entity138 soldiers introduced her to when they liberated her in @entity119 in 1945			2
" i want to have a full life , not to be damaged goods , " she says			0
perhaps that defiant spirit helped the teenager survive the horrors of @entity43 and later blossom as an emigre in the @entity138			0
shortly after the war , @entity9 met and married a fellow @entity29 jew who had been a partisan , anti-nazi fighter			1
the young family moved with their infant daughter to the @entity138 to escape communist rule in @entity29			0
" she was very shy when i was growing up , " recalls @entity9 's eldest daughter , @entity152 who says her mother transformed in the 1970s , after a visit to @entity19			1
" after that , she changed dramatically , " the daughter says			0
" there had always been a bit of sadness behind her eyes , and afterwards , it was gone			0
i think it did free her , and she became who she is now			0
" it was also in the 1970s that @entity9 began studying psychology			2
decades later , she still works as a clinical psychologist , running a practice out of her home in @entity1			0
her specialty involved treating patients suffering from post traumatic stress disorder			0
" she evolved at a time as a psychologist when @entity179 was n't even on the map , " says dr. @entity173 , professor emeritus in psychiatry at the @entity175 , who has known and worked with @entity9 for more than 20 years			1
" she is an expert by definition almost by having had that experience herself but also relating to it in a clinical way , as well as in a deeply personal way , " @entity173 said			0
throughout her career in psychology , @entity9 has done extensive consulting work with the @entity138 military , treating @entity138 veterans of wars in @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			2
she has also helped set up shelters for female victims of domestic abuse			0
" @entity19 gave me a tremendous gift in some ways , that i can guide people to have resilience and perseverance , " @entity9 says			1
in time , @entity9 also become a motivational public speaker , performing a @entity203 and giving speeches at schools and universities			2
she litters her @entity29 - accented @entity207 with aphorisms aimed at mental healing			0
" @entity212 love is self care , " she tells patients			0
" the biggest concentration camp is in our mind			0
" " she blew me away with her extraordinary optimism and energy , " @entity173 says , recalling the first time he saw @entity9 speaking to an audience			2
" she is a force of nature			0
" seventy years after the liberation of @entity19 , this @entity17 survivor 's greatest pride and joy are clearly her three great - grandchildren			1
" that 's the best revenge to @entity235 i can think of , " says the dancer , pointing at one of several portraits of her smiling great - grandchildren in her office .			0
