-- april 16 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : some fast facts to get us going today : i 'm @entity19			1
fridays are awesome ! today 's show is out of this world , or at least , that 's where it starts			1
first up : space strategy @entity27 : @entity28			1
what parts of it are we going to explore ? how much money are we going to spend to get there ? president @entity34 has a new strategy that answers those questions			1
he talked about it in a speech at the @entity39 yesterday			1
the president says he is 100 percent committed to @entity41 and its mission			1
he 's proposing that the agency get an additional $ 6 billion over the next 5 years , with a goal of sending humans to @entity46 by the 2030s			1
but under this plan , what you wo n't see is this : people walking on the moon			1
president @entity34 's strategy would cancel plans to send astronauts back there			1
he says , " we 've been there before			1
there 's a lot more of space to explore			1
" @entity63 , one of the first men to walk on the moon , agrees with the president			1
but @entity63 's @entity41 crewmate , @entity67 , the first man to walk on the moon , disagrees			1
he 's part of a group of astronauts that have criticized the president 's plan			1
other @entity41 officials argue that the proposal could cost thousands of people their jobs			1
the president believes it 's a way to move forward			1
@entity80 president @entity34 : this is the next chapter that we can write together here at @entity41			1
we will partner with industry , we will invest in cutting - edge research and technology			1
we will set far - reaching milestones and provide the resources to reach those milestones			1
and step by step , we will push the boundaries , not only of where we can go , but what we can do			1
@entity95 @entity27 : the president 's also ordering a review of mines that have bad safety records			1
this comes after last week 's tragedy at the @entity102 in @entity5			1
president @entity34 has criticized the company that owns the mine , specifically because of its safety record			1
the company called that criticism " regrettable " and said the president may be misinformed about the mine 's safety record			1
meantime , the governor of @entity5 has asked all of the state 's miners to show up for work today			1
but instead of producing coal , he wants them to spend the day re-evaluating safety procedures			1
gov. @entity119 , ( @entity120 ) @entity5 : what better honor can we give those fallen miners than to say we 're gon na dedicate this day , re-evaluate , have seminars , re-inspect			1
and those that have repeated violations will be heavily inspected			1
that 's all we can do in honor of those miners , so that we never have another family or miner go through this			1
@entity133 rally @entity27 : switching over to politics , the @entity133 movement is getting ready for the midterm elections coming up in november			1
the group has released a list of " heroes and targets			1
" the " heroes " on the list are candidates that the @entity133 plans to support in the elections			1
the " targets " are anyone that the group would like to see voted out of office			2
of course , lists are not the only way that the @entity133 gets its message out			2
rallies are the group 's bread and butter			2
this one in @entity156 yesterday was wrapping up a three - week tour across the @entity80 the timing : no coincidence			2
yesterday , of course , was @entity161 , and the group is opposed to what it sees as government overspending			2
@entity165 @entity27 : in @entity4 , @entity5 and all over the @entity80 , people are taking time today to honor the victims of a deadly shooting			2
it happened on the campus of @entity172 three years ago today			2
police say a student at the school went on a shooting spree , killing 32 people before killing himself			2
today , @entity172 and the local community are holding memorial ceremonies like this remembrance run from last year			2
candlelight vigils and a community arts project are also scheduled to mark the day			2
word to the @entity184 @entity185 , @entity15 : a word to the @entity184 ... dormant ( adjective ) temporarily inactive , or in a state of no external activity source : @entity191 @entity192 @entity27 : a volcano in @entity6 had been dormant for more than 180 years			1
but then a few weeks ago , this started			2
the volcano is erupting , and some scientists say it could last for more than a year			1
that 's about how long it went the last time this happened			2
that was back in the 1820s			1
this time , the impact is being felt all across @entity203			1
here , you see @entity206 's @entity205 , planes on the ground			2
where you do n't see them is in the sky			2
the @entity213 is not alone in this			2
more than half a dozen countries canceled flights yesterday ; up to 6,000 total across the @entity219 continent			1
when the volcano erupted , it sent this huge cloud of smoke and ash high up into the air			1
if a jet were to fly through that , it could cause the plane 's engines to shut down			2
so , that 's why there are so many cancellations			2
@entity235 looks at how weather and winds are playing a part in all of this			2
@entity240 , @entity241 : the way the weather pattern is set up right now -- and @entity6 , obviously , to the north -- but we 've got this funky upper air pattern about 30,000 feet , which is where that ash went to , up where the jets fly			1
and it 's scooting around towards @entity252 , back through parts of the @entity213 and also into other parts of @entity203			1
here is the , here it is on the infrared satellite picture			2
you see it right there kind of heading this way			2
that 's the cloud itself			2
@entity264 @entity27 : major political change in @entity7			2
the president of the central @entity268 country has resigned			0
@entity269 left for neighboring @entity270 yesterday after he was forced out of power last week			0
this was all part of a deal between @entity269 and @entity7 's new government			0
@entity276 , the @entity80 and several international groups helped in the negotiations			0
@entity7 's temporary government told the @entity280 that it plans to hold elections in six months			0
the @entity80 says it hopes that @entity7 will become a model for democracy in the region			0
the country is important to the @entity80 because there 's a military base there			0
and that base supports @entity290 operations in @entity291			0
@entity292 @entity293 , @entity15 : as we wrap up @entity295 , today 's shoutout goes out to all the librarians out there ! where would you find the largest library in the world ? is it in : a ) @entity304 , b ) @entity206 , c ) @entity156 or @entity306 ) @entity307 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity156 is home to the @entity80 @entity309 , the largest library in the world			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! escape to charity @entity27 : @entity317 's collection is n't quite that large , but she has rounded up more than 30,000 books			0
and just like a library , her goal is to share them with other people			0
who she shares them with , and why , are what make @entity317 a @entity325			0
( begin video ) @entity327 , @entity0 hero : i was in the fifth grade when i hurt my knee			1
@entity332 : ready ? @entity333 : yeah , i 'm ready			0
the doctor diagnosed me with reflex sympathetic dystrophy			0
when something touches it , it 's like a bomb goes off in my knee			0
even though i 've tried many different treatments , the only thing able to get my mind off the pain was reading			0
do you guys like to read ? my pediatrician told me about a home for abused children			0
any child being in horrible pain like this , they need something , and something that i knew that helped me was books			0
this is called " @entity358			0
" but the people in these shelters are just like you and me			0
they need things to get their mind off of whatever they 're going through			0
i put flyers in mailboxes and i set up a web site			0
thank you so much for donating			0
my original goal was to get 300 books			0
before i knew it , i had 3,000 books			0
my total right now is 38,000 books			0
and i 've delivered books to libraries and reading rooms in 27 different shelters in six states			0
and take as many books as you want			0
if one child finds a love of reading through books i 've given them , then that will help them in school and just turn their life around entirely			0
i really think that reading can do that for someone			0

no helmets , no pads , no problem , right ? it 's called fingerboarding ; it 's kind - of like skateboarding			0
everything 's scaled down to size			0
but these guys are trying to land jumps and kick - flips , just like those of you who skateboard			0
it may look a little strange ; maybe it 's just the next generation of boarding			0
goodbye @entity27 : i mean , after all , it seems like the perfect sport for the digital age			0
we 're sure they wo n't get board with it			0
we wo n't have any more puns ; we 're just sitting here , spinning our wheels			0
