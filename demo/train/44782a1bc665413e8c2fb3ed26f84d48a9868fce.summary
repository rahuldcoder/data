@entity0 -- on tuesday , it was climate change			1
and on thursday , president @entity5 confronted yet another emergency that threatens wide destruction overseas : the @entity9 outbreak spreading in @entity10			2
crisis management has become a hallmark of @entity5 's second term , perhaps seen nowhere better than at the annual @entity14 , where the world 's leaders -- and their attendant calamities -- converge upon @entity18			1
@entity5 's three main issues here -- climate change , @entity22 and @entity9 -- each has the potential to rapidly spiral out of control , officials suggest , with the effects of a warming planet already being registered and @entity29 overseas already being killed both by terrorists with the @entity31 in @entity32 and @entity33 and by the deadly virus spreading in @entity10			1
@entity9 patients left to lie on the ground hoping to demonstrate to fellow leaders his government 's handle on the problems , @entity5 said wednesday that the @entity29 " will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done " when it comes to helping solve the world 's problems			1
but throughout his 48 hours at the @entity0 , @entity5 made clear he was n't going to take it all on himself			1
" we can not do this alone , " he said during remarks at a session on combating @entity9 , which has struck three countries in @entity10 and prompted a large - scale @entity29 military effort to stop its spread			2
@entity53 : ebola cases could reach at least 550,000 by january " we do n't have the capacity to do all of this by ourselves , " he said , adding , " i hope i 'm properly communicating the sense of urgency here			0
do not stand by thinking that somehow because of what we 've done , that it 's taken care of			0
" that warning of the limits to @entity29 power is broadly the same message @entity5 wanted to deliver on climate change and @entity22 , which he focused on this week			1
both threats , @entity5 said at various points , will require coalitions of governments to act rather than the @entity29 alone			2
@entity74 unanimously passes anti-terror resolution " nobody gets a pass " when it comes to reducing carbon emissions , @entity5 said , singling out @entity76 as a country that has a " special responsibility " to figure out ways of emitting fewer gases that scientists believe lead to global warming			0
as he directs the @entity29 to rein in pollution from coal - powered plants , @entity5 hopes other nations that emit large amounts of carbon will follow along , though commitments from @entity76 , @entity93 and @entity94 have been modest			2
without firm plans from those countries to reduce carbon use , climate experts say , there 's little hope of turning around warming trends that threaten the global population			0
marchers sound urgent call for climate change ahead of @entity0 assembly so , too , will the threat from @entity22 be contained only through coalition pressure , @entity5 and his aides maintained at the @entity0 " we can not do this for you " was his message to newly elected @entity32 prime minister @entity111 during a meeting wednesday , saying that any resolution to @entity32 's problems could come only from a lasting , inclusive government			1
the coalition of @entity122 countries that joined in the @entity29 air campaign over @entity33 -- a victory for @entity5 and secretary of state @entity125 -- can help " de-legitimize " the ideology espoused by @entity22 , @entity29 officials say , making the group an essential part of @entity5 's war plan			1
" this is not @entity29 's fight alone , " he said tuesday before leaving for the global gathering in @entity18			2
the long , slow fight against @entity22 : airstrikes , failures on the ground commitments have been forthcoming , including a unanimous vote at the @entity74 for new standards in stemming the flow of foreign fighters			0
but even that measure will be hard to enforce , underscoring the difficultly in getting even like - minded nations moving in the same direction			0
" resolutions alone will not be enough , " @entity5 said			0
" promises on paper can not keep us safe			0
" the words spoken here today must be matched and translated into action , into deeds -- concrete action , within nations and between them , not just in the days ahead but for years to come			0

@entity5 made clear at the @entity0 that the @entity29 is n't going to take the world 's problems alone
@entity5 's main issues at @entity0 -- @entity22 , climate change , @entity9 -- could spiral out of control
" resolutions alone will not be enough . promises on paper can not keep us safe . "
