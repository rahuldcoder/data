the names of some @entity3 concentration camps live in infamy : @entity5 , where @entity6 died			1
@entity7 , the first camp			0
@entity9 , where more than 1 million jews , @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , @entity12 , @entity14 prisoners of war and others were killed			2
but as horrific as they were , they were only three camp complexes in a system of more than 850 ghettos , concentration camps , forced - labor camps and extermination camps that the @entity25 established during the 12 years @entity27 was in power			1
by the end of @entity31 in 1945 , the death camp system stretched from @entity32 and the @entity33 in the west to @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity12 in the east			1
there were 20 main concentration camps , many of which had many subcamps , according to @entity43 , the editor of the @entity45 's @entity44			1
many of them combined the most dehumanizing and degrading characteristics of prison and slave labor camps			0
in some , @entity3 doctors carried out depraved experiments , while others were primarily transit camps -- places to hold @entity10 and other " undesirables " until they were sent to other camps			1
there were also four main extermination camps -- @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 -- devoted solely to killing everyone who passed through their gates			2
@entity63 nearly rivaled @entity9 in the sheer number of people who were murdered there			2
between 870,000 and 925,000 people were killed at @entity63 in @entity12 , 170,000 died at @entity62 , at least 152,000 were murdered at @entity61 , and about 434,500 @entity10 were killed at @entity60			0
in all , about 6 million @entity10 and millions of others died in the @entity72			1
but the exact numbers of dead will probably never be known , nor will the total number of people held prisoner in @entity3 camps			0
the @entity25 were famously good record keepers , but they managed to destroy the records of some camps before the @entity82 liberated them			0
the infamous @entity85 - @entity84 camp , which -- like @entity9 -- had elements of both concentration camp and extermination camp , was one where records were destroyed			1
about 80,000 to 110,000 people died in the main camp , but it 's impossible to know how many prisoners it held in its time			0
@entity5 was another camp whose overlords erased as much history as they could			0
historians may never determine how many prisoners the camp held in its time , but it 's clear that about 50,000 people perished there , including @entity6 , who died of disease mere weeks before the camp was liberated .			0

@entity9 , the most infamous @entity3 camp , was just one of more than 850 camps
there were 20 main concentration camps , plus another four extermination camp complexes
six million @entity10 and millions of others were murdered in the @entity3 camp system
