@entity13 , a nongovernmental organization that supports democracy and freedom of the media , said in its annual press freedom survey that " negative trends " outweighed " positive movements in every region , particularly in the @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity23			1
" " this marked the seventh straight year of overall deterioration			0
improvements in a small number of countries -- including bright spots in parts of @entity31 and @entity23 -- were overshadowed by a continued , relentless assault on independent news media by a wide range of actions , in both authoritarian states and countries with very open media environments			1
" @entity5 -- once the only country to be consistently rated free by the group in the @entity22 and @entity23 -- was ranked as " partly free " because of the @entity42 conflict			1
the report cited " increased travel restrictions on both @entity5 and foreign reporters ; official attempts to influence media coverage of the conflict within @entity5 ; and greater self - censorship and biased reporting , particularly during the outbreak of open war in late december			1
" elsewhere in the @entity22 , there are concerns about harassment of journalists and bloggers in @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			1
the drop in violence in war - torn @entity65 helped journalists move around the country , and a new law in the @entity70 region gave journalists " unprecedented freedoms			2
" @entity8 , which is part of @entity74 , also dropped in rankings from free to partly free , a reflection of " the growing influence of @entity78 over media and free expression in the territory			0
" " of particular concern were the appointment of 10 owners of @entity8 media outlets to a mainland @entity74 political advisory body , increased restrictions on film releases in the period surrounding the @entity91 , and reports that critics of @entity78 encountered growing difficulty in gaining access to @entity8 media platforms			0
" the report cited deterioration of of freedoms in @entity7 , which has been characterized as @entity101 's freest media environment			2
that 's because of " legal pressures and attempts to control broadcast media outlets			0
" @entity6 dropped from free to partly free because of the " increased use of courts and libel laws to limit free speech , heightened physical and extralegal intimidation by both organized crime and far - right groups , and concerns over media ownership and influence , " the report said			1
it cited fears about media magnate @entity119 becoming prime minister again			0
there are concerns about " the concentration of state - owned and private outlets under a single leader			2
" in the @entity21 , " legal pressure and attempts to control broadcast media outlets " were cited in @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129			1
the report noted other problems in @entity127 , saying " reporters suffer from a high level of personal insecurity , and impunity for past murders or physical attacks against journalists is the norm			0
" across @entity23 , there were " some improvements , " citing developments in @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148			2
but there were continued problems in places like @entity153 and @entity154			2
" @entity156 took a significant step backward due to a dramatic increase in both legal and extralegal action against journalists and media houses , accompanied by overtly hostile rhetoric from the president and other officials , " the report said			0
the report cited strides in @entity31 nations , ranking the once " not free " @entity168 to " partly free			1
" it mentioned a " new constitution protecting freedom of expression , the opening of additional private radio and television stations , the release of a prominent journalist from life imprisonment , and a general loosening of restrictions after the country 's first democratic presidential election in october			0
" it said @entity184 and @entity185 reversed declines in freedom of the media			0
but there were setbacks in @entity191 and @entity192 , two countries racked by warfare			0
in some countries in the @entity196 , such as @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , " attacks and official rhetoric against the media escalated			0
" @entity202 and @entity203 were ranked as not free , and there were " high levels of intimidation and self - censorship " in @entity208 and @entity209			1
positive developments were noted in @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213			0
the worst - rated countries in the world are @entity216 , @entity203 , @entity154 , @entity58 , @entity217 and @entity218			1
" given the current economic climate , which is certain to place a further strain on media sustainability and diversity in rich and poor countries alike , pressures on media freedom are now looming from all angles and are increasingly threatening the considerable gains of the past quarter - century , " the report said .			1
