@entity0 -- @entity3 's electoral map has many colors in comparison to the red and blue of @entity9 , yet on both sides of the @entity11 , battleground state elections can portend change on the national level			1
voters in @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , @entity3 's most populous state , go to the polls this sunday , and what they decide will set the tone for @entity3 federal politics just as citizen sentiments in bellwethers such as @entity21 or @entity22 affect the balance of power in @entity24 in turn , @entity25 will be watching because @entity3 is the power broker within the @entity28 -- and this will not be the first time that @entity14 has caused @entity31 to pause while @entity3 political parties jockeyed to govern in a region that generates nearly 4 % of @entity34			1
the state has many large cities with a population density to match @entity38 , and nearly a quarter of @entity3 's top 100 companies are based there			1
when @entity14 voters went to the polls in 2010 @entity31 was on their minds			1
the @entity45 drama was unfolding but the @entity3 government -- consisting of chancellor @entity48 's conservative @entity47 ( @entity49 ) and its junior partner , the @entity51 ( @entity52 ) -- tactically delayed any action until after the vote in @entity14			1
nonetheless , the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) and @entity57 came back into power in the form of a minority government			0
because a budget could not be passed this march the legislature was dissolved and @entity14 will again hold a vote , this time with @entity45 confronting an exit from the eurozone and other @entity28 nations choked with debt and high unemployment			1
this week 's state election will also be a referendum on chancellor @entity48 's handling of the @entity74 crisis			0
although chancellor @entity48 has governed since 2005 , first in a grand coalition with the @entity55 ( @entity56 ) and then with the @entity49 's dream partner , the @entity52 , since 2009 , and although she consistently tops popularity polls among her peers ; @entity3 has seen the winds of change in a number of state elections over the past two years			1
the @entity14 electoral results will have pundits and pollsters predicting its significance for the capital			2
@entity14 is an election to watch for trends and disruptions in @entity3 politics			1
in the short term , the first question will be whether or not the governing coalition will last until the next federal election scheduled for the fall of 2013			0
after all , chancellor @entity48 can thank the 2005 @entity14 election for ushering the @entity49 back into federal government one year sooner than hoped for			2
@entity14 was a traditional stronghold for the @entity56 , and after many decades serving as a governing party , the @entity55 along with the @entity57 were voted out in favor of the @entity49 and @entity52			2
as a result , chancellor @entity102 tried to consolidate power in the midst of internal struggles within his own party due to reform under @entity110			0
at the time , @entity3 was suffering high unemployment and sluggish growth			0
agenda 2010 was a plan to jump - start the country 's social market economy with tax cuts and entitlement reductions			0
chancellor @entity102 called for a snap election that year and a few months later found himself handing over the keys to the @entity122 to @entity48			0
today , many would agree that @entity3 's current economic strength is linked to the belt - tightening and painful measures undertaken in the name of @entity110			1
moreover , the 2005 @entity14 election introduced an era of fragmentation and disenchantment in the @entity3 political landscape			2
the 2005 @entity14 election gave rise to the @entity133 , exhibited low voter turnout , and left the traditional catch - all parties straddling right - and - left of center			2
these trends happened again during the federal election a few months later and consequently it took nearly two months for @entity3 to form a government			0
one can only imagine the amount of coalition wrangling during the next federal election with yet another political party on the scene -- the @entity148			0
so far , the @entity148 , which made its debut during the @entity0 state election last september , seems to have a singular focus on the interne			0
but the subject of transparency is also on the agenda and has struck a chord with @entity3 voters			0
when one hand does n't suffice to count the number of political parties in @entity3 , anticipate instability within @entity31 's powerhouse			1
voters in @entity14 wo n't experience automated calls or be asked to donate over the internet , but the votes they cast will have an impact on the future course of @entity3 and its role within @entity31			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 - @entity172			0

@entity175 says the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) vote can portend national change
@entity25 will be watching because @entity3 is the power broker with the @entity28 , she says
@entity182 : the *appearance* of new parties could herald instability within @entity3
she adds that the @entity14 vote will have an impact on @entity3 's future role in @entity31
