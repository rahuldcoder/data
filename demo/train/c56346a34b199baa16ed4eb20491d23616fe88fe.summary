-- sing it with me , kids ! i 'm a little @entity4 short and stout , here is mein handle , here is mein spout			2
so , @entity8 is selling a new teapot that looks sort of like @entity10			1
well , inasmuch as a teapot can actually appear like a fascist dictator			1
and , really , it might be the greatest advertising gaffe you 'll ever see			2
at least until @entity17 somehow becomes a spokesman for @entity19			2
" damn it , @entity21 , what were we thinking ? " back to the teapot : it did n't take long for motorists on @entity28 's 405 freeway -- where evening plans go to die -- to notice something in the sky that looked a little unusual			1
it was a billboard promoting this new kitchen essential			1
and there was no mistaking its resemblance			2
( not to be confused with the classic @entity38 double album by the same name			2
) now , in case you ca n't quite figure out the similarities in the teapot image , notice that the top handle swoops wider to one side mimicking @entity10 's dark , curtained hair			1
the knob on the lid closely resembles his infamous trademark toothbrush moustache			2
and the spout rises into the air as though he 's giving a @entity4 salute			0
that , or he 's just waving to the @entity55 coffee maker			0
either way , it 's him			0
however , at this time i ca n't confirm whether or not the @entity10 teapot is designed with only one testicle			1
clearly , that little attention to detail would prove this was far more than a simple coincidence			2
mind you , the standard two testicles would be equally concerning			0
regardless , i 'm still willing to give @entity8 the benefit of the doubt that this was all just an accident			1
( the retailer did n't respond to our request for comment			0
) though , to be fair , as a spectator of life with a front row seat , i do enjoy the controversy			0
for if you 're going to accidentally have your product resemble a famous person , somehow , by a strange law of comedy that ca n't be explained , the absolute worst human being in the history of the world is far more amusing than , say , @entity86			0
now , understand that this particular teapot , from @entity8 's exclusive @entity89 collection , quickly went viral after images of the billboard appeared on @entity92 and @entity93			1
and that 's when things turned delightfully melodramatic			0
@entity98 's @entity97 mayor , @entity96 , complained to @entity100 magazine : " i am disappointed @entity8 actually put that billboard up in the first place			1
... as a jew , i am offended , ( and ) as an elected official , i am mad that the city i represent is linked to this			1
" presumably , he then breathed heavily into a paper bag for half an hour while listening to @entity107			0
seriously , pull yourself together , man			0
if anything , here 's all you had to say : " yep			0
surprised they did n't see it , but i 'm pretty sure there was no intention to offend anyone			0
my guess is they 'll take down the billboard and apologize			2
" which is exactly what @entity8 did			1
they took down the billboard and even had some fun on @entity93 replying to comments			2
in fact , when comedian @entity131 tweeted , " well , @entity8 , get ready to sell a @entity126 of these teakettles to a lot of ironic hipsters , " the retailer quickly responded with , " totally unintentional			1
but they 'll need to grab it in stores since it 's sold out online			0
" naturally , sales skyrocketed after the photos went viral			0
the $ 40 teapot is now back - ordered on @entity8 's site until late june , and some of the teapots even started listing on @entity142 for $ 200			1
sadly , i have to admit that now i kind of want one for my house as a conversation piece			0
" so , what do you think of my @entity10 teapot ? " " i think you need to put on pants			1
" not surprisingly , the sales boom started when it all became one big social media circus			0
which is why you sort of have to applaud the seemingly levelheaded responses by @entity8 , which never equaled the drama of @entity96 's outrage culture hysteria			1
even the @entity158 took it in stride , commenting to @entity100 that " @entity8 did the right thing by responding to public concerns and removing the tea pot from their product line			1
we take @entity8 at their word that any resemblance to the @entity4 dictator was completely unintended			1
" in the end , it 's just a minor blip in the cosmos			0
but , from a social perspective , what 's truly interesting is that @entity10 -- at least as an iconic image -- does n't seem to have the same meaning to a newer generation which is further removed from his horrors and unthinkable crimes			1
kind of like @entity180 to anyone during the last 700 years			0
these days , to many , @entity10 has become just sort of a caricature , having transcended his evil reality into something far more abstract			1
and this explains why we nonchalantly have the website @entity189			0
which , clearly , by the laws of comedy , is way more fun than dogs that look like @entity86 .			0

the @entity10 - like teapot on a @entity8 billboard caught the attention of motorists
@entity8 says any similarities to @entity10 were unintentional
@entity98 mayor was offended by the ad placement in his city
