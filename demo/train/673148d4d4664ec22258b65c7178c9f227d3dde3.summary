-- @entity1 has rejected a @entity0 public records request for a copy of a 1998 campus police report tied to sexual misconduct allegations made against then - assistant football coach @entity6 , a lawyer for the school told @entity0			1
@entity8 , an assistant general counsel , asserted in a letter to @entity0 that @entity1 is " a state - related institution " and not a " state school " like some in other states , and therefore does not have the same public records requirements as other public institutions			1
" because the 1998 investigation did not result in any criminal charges , it is not criminal history information and the university 's police are thus required by law to keep that information within the police department , " @entity8 wrote			1
according to a grand jury 's report released in early november , the mother of one of @entity6 's accusers -- identified as @entity28 -- came forward and said the coach had showered with her son and hugged him			1
two campus police detectives eavesdropped on conversations in may 1998 when the mother confronted the coach , who retired a year later from the @entity38 program			0
police later monitored a second conversation that month , in which the mother told @entity6 to stay away from her son			2
i was wrong , " @entity6 said , according to the grand jury report			2
" i wish i could get forgiveness			0
i know i wo n't get it from you			0
i wish i were dead			0
" no charges were ever filed in that instance , and local and state law enforcement authorities did not look deeper into those and other allegations against @entity6 until years later			1
he now faces at least 50 charges related to alleged sex abuse perpetrated against young boys over a 14 - year period			2
he has plead not guilty to all charges , saying in interviews that while he may have " horsed around " with children he never sexually assaulted them			0
@entity0 had asked for a copy of the @entity1 campus police report of that 1998 investigation , citing @entity62 's " right - to - @entity61 " that offers access for citizens and media to " public information			1
" @entity68 officials to face trial unlike many commonwealth agencies , @entity1 and three other schools that receive state funds do n't fall under @entity62 's right - to - know law , according to @entity74 , the executive director of the state 's @entity75			1
in 2007 , state lawmakers considered a change that would have included the school under the open records law			0
but @entity1 president @entity81 -- who lost his job days after the grand jury report came out this fall , after initially supporting two school officials accused of covering up a 2002 eyewitness allegation against @entity6 -- testified against the move before the @entity87			1
@entity81 told the legislature he was concerned about the cost and compliance of @entity1 being subject to the law			2
he also said that there were competitive reasons for keeping records private			0
" nobody would argue the point that the public has a right to know how public funds are spent , " he said at the time			0
" but these proposals will fundamentally change the way we operate , the way our trustees govern , and the way the university administers their policies			0

a @entity1 lawyer says @entity0 can not have the police report tied to a 1998 probe
that investigation related to @entity6 's alleged sexual misconduct with a boy
it did n't lead to criminal charges , which is a reason info was n't provided , the lawyer says
@entity62 's " right - to - know " law does n't apply to @entity1 , even if it gets state funds
