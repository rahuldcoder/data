@entity1 , @entity0 -- after battling for nearly two days with tear gas , water cannons and pepper spray , @entity0 police retreated from @entity1 's central @entity7 on saturday afternoon , allowing tens of thousands of demonstrators to pour into the space			1
a peaceful sit - in on friday against government plans to demolish a park was met with a police crackdown , igniting the biggest anti-government riots this city has seen in a decade			1
prime minister @entity16 demanded an end to the violent protests , which have also spread to the capital city of @entity20 and the port city of @entity22			2
" the police were there yesterday , they are there today , and they will be there tomorrow			2
@entity7 can not be allowed to be a place where marginal groups can freely roam , " he said in a televised speech			0
the clashes in @entity1 subsided saturday afternoon , when police allowed protesters to flow into the square			1
the protesters pelted police vehicles with stones as they withdrew from the area			1
at least 79 people , including 26 members of the @entity0 security forces , were injured in the clashes across the country , interior minister @entity39 told @entity0 's semi-official @entity46 news agency on saturday			1
among the injured were 14 in @entity1 , including one who suffered brain trauma , the @entity1 governor 's office said			1
@entity0 authorities have detained 939 people in connection with the protests , @entity51 told @entity46			1
in the @entity20 , police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters , with some chanting " @entity61 resign , " as they marched on the neighborhood of @entity63 , demonstrators told @entity2			1
" police are everywhere , and helicopters are monitoring our movements , " one protester said			2
" whenever police see us march , they come and gas us			1
... we were gassed , we disbursed and then gathered again			0
" @entity16 conceded in his speech on saturday that @entity0 security forces had made excessive use of tear gas against demonstrators			1
" there have been errors in the actions of the security forces , especially with regard to use of pepper gas			2
right now that is being investigated , researched , " he said			0
" there is an error there , sure			0
when it is used excessively we are against it as well			0
and in fact there was such excess			0
" earlier saturday crowds gathered across central @entity1 and chanted " government resign " and " shoulder to shoulder against fascism " as phalanxes of helmeted riot police responded with volleys of tear gas canisters			1
lost amid the explosion of anti-government anger in the streets of @entity1 and elsewhere was the original source of the protests			1
earlier this week , several dozen activists tried to stage a sit - in in @entity103 , the last bit of green space left in @entity7			0
the demonstrators were protesting government plans to level the park and replace it with a reconstruction of a replica @entity111 - era military barracks and a shopping mall			0
the protests have since devolved into a demonstration against @entity16 , the most powerful , popular and polarizing leader @entity0 has seen in generations			1
this major transport hub and commercial district has become the main battleground between angry protesters who hurled stones and bottles at riot police			1
in some @entity1 neighborhoods , residents banged pots and pans in protest on the street during the prime minister 's speech			1
@entity16 's chief adviser , @entity132 , said police have been ordered to be judicious in how they confront the demonstrators			0
addressing the original complaint , @entity132 said that @entity1 's mayor said he is considering a number of projects at the park , and not necessarily a shopping mall			1
but the scope of the protests show there is a bigger issue about freedom of speech versus accusations of authoritative government			0
" people are entitled to disagreement with the government , they can exercise their democratic rights , but they can do so within the context of a democratic society , " @entity132 said			0
international human rights groups @entity157 and @entity158 have denounced what they describe as excessive use of police force against peaceful protesters			2
@entity0 has enjoyed an unprecedented decade of economic growth , since @entity16 's @entity164 first swept to power after winning elections in 2002 on a campaign to institute pro-democratic reforms			2
in recent years , the @entity0 government has come under fire from media watchdog groups for its prolonged detention of more journalists than any other country in the world			1
@entity0 security forces have also made such frequent use of tear gas against opposition protesters that some critics have started referring to the prime minister as " @entity182			1
" but the protests this week appear to be " much more than the government and authorities expected , " @entity183 , a sociology professor at @entity184 in @entity20 , told @entity2			0
he said it was unclear whether the protest movement will sustain its momentum , but it has caught the government 's attention			0
" the reason for massive protest in @entity0 is in fact trivial			2
( a construction in a park			0
) but this shows the cumulative reaction to @entity16 , " wrote @entity198 , a @entity0 newspaper columnist and outspoken champion of " liberal @entity200			2
" " @entity16 needs to see that the country needs more ' participatory democracy			0
' people want to influence decisions in public matters ... it is ultimately none other than @entity16 who cultivated this anger and who needs to calm it down			0
" @entity16 probably did not know thousands of people who voted for him were among those raising their voices as well , " columnist @entity212 wrote saturday in the @entity214 newspaper @entity213			0
" if he does not return to his pro-democracy stance , this would prepare his fall in @entity0 politics			2
@entity224 , his place of birth in politics , can bring him his political death			0
" @entity2 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
