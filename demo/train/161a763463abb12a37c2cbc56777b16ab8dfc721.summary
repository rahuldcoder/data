-- " the vice-presidency is n't worth a pitcher of warm piss			2
" those famous words were uttered by @entity5 to describe the office he held from 1933 to 1941			2
and @entity7 , our nation 's first vice president , described the position as : " ... the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived			1
" if the vice presidency is such a useless position , why are so many people now vying to be @entity19 's running mate ? because they know it might just be the best job in the country -- or at least in the federal government			1
being vice president is like being one of the lesser @entity27 sisters ( whatever their names are )			1
@entity29 -- who is in essence the " president " of the clan -- is a household name , but she is also subject to a lot more scrutiny and pressure			0
her sisters , however , are similar to our vp : they are paid great , treated like celebrities , and have almost no responsibilities			1
look at some of the perks of being vice president : an annual salary of about $ 230,000 , a beautiful house , a jet plane , limo service , a staff and even your own seal			1
all that is missing is a few product endorsement deals and the vice president truly would be a @entity27			1
but wait , there are even more benefits , such as safety			0
reprehensibly , a few our past presidents have been assassinated			0
but no one shoots at the veep			1
in fact , our vice presidents have shot other people			0
@entity65 shot his friend in the face just a few years ago			0
and in 1804 , vice president @entity68 had an infamous duel in which he shot and killed the former secretary of the treasury , @entity70			0
and we think that today 's political climate is rough			1
another bonus of being vp : very few constitutionally mandated obligations			1
the president has too many responsibilities to list			1
but the vp has only three : 1			1
president of the @entity77 -- which is ceremonial position ; 2			2
cast the tie breaking vote if the @entity77 is ever deadlocked ; and 3			0
accept the tally of the @entity81 for the presidential election " in the presence of the @entity77 and @entity84			0
" there are assistant managers at @entity87 who have more daily job responsibilities than our vice president			1
indeed , there were 16 times in our nation 's history that the office was vacant -- and in many cases for years at a time			2
it was not until 1967 that the 25th amendment was adopted to establish a mechanism to replace a vice president if he left office midterm			0
apparently , no one really cared too much before then if the vice presidency was vacant			0
arguably the most painful responsibility for a sitting vp comes if he runs for president and loses			1
the vp is still required by the @entity107 to read the name of the person who beat him in the presence of the entire @entity111 -- like @entity112 did in 2000			2
lots of work ? no. and then there are the intangible benefits			0
for example , not too many people want your job			2
people grow up dreaming of being president			0
you do n't hear kids say : " one day i hope to grow up and be elected to the second - highest position in the federal government			2
" no. we are a nation of alphas , not betas			0
plus , the media and political opponents do n't pounce on every syllable the vp utters like they do with the president and presidential candidates			2
( i propose that any person running for president be read in essence a presidential " @entity140 " explaining to him / her that anything they say , can and will be used against them -- even words taken out of context or are ones said by unnamed campaign advisors			0
) in contrast , the vp has the luxury to say stupid things			1
our current one , @entity152 , is famous for them			0
his " best " may have been when he offered his public condolences to the prime minister of @entity156 for the passing of his mother			0
the only problem was that the prime minister 's mother was still very much alive			2
but the modern day " president " of vice presidential gaffes had to be @entity165 , a.k.a. @entity165			1
this guy made @entity168 sound like a philosopher king			0
@entity165 made such " insightful " statements as : " republicans understand the importance of bondage between a mother and child			1
" and this gem : " the future will be better tomorrow			0
" soon , @entity19 -- ironically the person seeking possibly the worst job in our nation -- will tell us whom he has chosen to possibly serve in the best job in our nation			2
at this point , speculation abounds who that person will be			0
but whoever is nominated for @entity38 should heed these sage words offered by @entity165 : " one word sums up probably the responsibility of any vice president , and that one word is ' to be prepared			1
' " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

@entity197 : many think vp is a useless position , but it may be the best job in the country
he says it 's like being a lesser @entity27 : perks , fame , salary and almost no responsibilities
other perks are : no one wants your job , no one shoots at you ; luxury to stay stupid things
@entity197 : @entity165 had a word for responsibility , and " that one word is ' to be prepared ' "
