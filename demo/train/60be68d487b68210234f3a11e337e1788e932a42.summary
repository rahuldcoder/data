-- my early childhood was a bit of a trip			2
i was born in the @entity5 , then moved to @entity6 , @entity7 and eventually @entity8			2
when i was about 7 , i had a series of severe ear infections			1
at the time , my family had no money , and we did n't have insurance , so there was no option to take care of it			2
i ended up losing full hearing in my right ear and 80 % hearing in my left			1
when i began attending public school , i did n't understand how the severity of my hearing loss would affect me ; neither did my parents or my teachers			1
there were many issues when it came to grades due to miscommunication between the teachers and me			2
they often thought i was ignoring them			2
eventually , when i was 11 , my parents started to pick up on it , which led to a doctor visit			0
my mother and i were told that i had significant hearing loss and that the hearing i had left was not guaranteed to stay			1
my mother had a hard time dealing with the news at first			0
it was one more obstacle that we were going to have to deal with as a family , and she knew it was bound to cause a hard time for me at school			1
when it came time to decide whether to go to a school for the deaf or continue in public school , i made the choice to stay where i was			1
my mother was a bit uncomfortable with the situation , but my fear of being labeled as different played a big part in my decision			0
i also decided i was just going to keep my hearing loss to myself			1
eventually my friends figured it out			0
it did n't really change anything between us , but from time to time , some other kids would make fun of me			0
one day in middle school a kid started making fun of me and mocked his own stereotypical idea of what a deaf person would speak like			1
one of my good friends , @entity74 , stopped me from thinking or doing anything negative and told me it was n't worth it			0
he said there will always be ignorant people like that in life , and i just have to brush it off -- to be me and that 's all that mattered			1
he also told me he had my back			0
but i still had trouble looking at school the same way			1
that incident brought reality into my life at an early age , so i kept to myself with my close friends			0
my career as a dj began in college			0
my parents owned a restaurant , and my father gave me the opportunity to dj a party one night			0
i immediately fell in love with the turntables and began to @entity95 more and more			1
from there i started dj'ing at clubs in the tri-state area , from @entity8 to @entity107 to @entity108 , and eventually also in @entity109 and @entity110			0
i started to get a following in those states , even as i continued to attend @entity113 to get my bachelor 's degree in biology			1
then i had to drop out of college my junior year due to financial trouble in a bad economy			0
@entity95 rocks despite hearing loss however , i stuck with my passion of spinning music , and after nearly a decade , i was granted a great opportunity			1
@entity124 took notice of what i was doing and what my movement stood for			0
we shot and aired a global commercial , which began a positive snowball effect for my career			0
doctors tell me there is a procedure that could restore my hearing			1
one day , when i have the time and money to get my hearing fixed , i probably will have the procedure done			1
but right now , i need to be on the forefront with my team , fighting for the issues in society that are too often overlooked			0
i intend to do so through my career in music and philanthropy			2
plus , there are just some things in life better off not being heard			0
when it comes down to it , life 's not about all the small negative things you encounter			2
it 's about being yourself and doing what you love to be happy			1
if you love something so much and have great passion for it , then just go for it			2
my team and i like to use the expression " why not ... ? " just ask yourself , why not ?			0
