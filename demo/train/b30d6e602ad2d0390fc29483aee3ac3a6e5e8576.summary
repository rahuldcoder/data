-- when @entity2 in northwest @entity3 recently informed its 200 employees that they had to sign a " personal lifestyle pledge " requiring them to reject homosexuality or lose their jobs , school administrators underscored a staggering injustice : in 29 @entity12 states , people can still be fired for being gay			1
while same - sex marriage and other equality debates soak up political and media attention , the @entity14 , a 37 - year - old bill , languishes in the @entity19			1
without that federal law , a majority of our states condone job , housing and other discrimination based on sexual orientation			1
an even larger number -- 35 -- have no protections for transgender people			2
even corporate @entity12 is ahead of our legislators on this issue : 87 % of @entity34 companies have policies barring discrimination based on sexual orientation			1
( about 46 % also protect gender identity			2
) what do the innovators and drivers of our economy know that our politicians do not ? despite a bomb threat that canceled classes , hundreds of @entity2 students , faculty , alumni and neighbors protested against the pledge on november 11			1
these individuals demonstrated tremendous courage in standing up to the university and its leaders ' opportunistic interpretation of religious tradition			0
i know something about the personal strength that kind of protest requires			0
in the late 1990s , when i stood as president @entity65 's nominee as @entity12 ambassador to the small @entity68 nation of @entity69 , @entity63 extremists circulated false allegations of pedophilia and other lies in hopes of sinking the nomination			2
they never once questioned my professional qualifications ; the only issue was my sexuality			0
one of the main reasons discrimination persists is that many people in @entity12 -- whether we speak of @entity83 , @entity2 's president , or presidential hopefuls @entity86 or @entity87 -- advance and reinforce the myth that being gay is a choice			1
for them , it is as if we silly @entity94 people would be perfectly happy and healthy if we would just make a different set of decisions about our lives			2
as a young boy growing up in @entity101 , @entity102 , teachers forced pens into my right hand in the futile hope of correcting my left - handedness			0
if they had known i was gay , they might have tried to fix that , too			0
i spent the first 35 years of my life trying very hard not to be gay , to the extent that i married my college sweetheart and created a beautiful family of five children with her			0
hard as i tried to make that life work , i could not escape my attraction to men			0
choice had nothing to do with it			0
scientists from @entity120 to @entity121 are finding evidence of what gay people know in their hearts : that sexual orientation is innate			1
recent research in @entity128 has identified differences in brain structure that may determine whether a person is gay or straight			0
until the time that people accept that all of us are born into our sexual orientation and identity , @entity94 citizens will still endure discrimination and selective application of the @entity141 's protections			1
through a social media campaign that includes online petitions , the anti-bigotry protesters are keeping pressure on @entity2 to drop its policy			1
but the question must be asked : why is it legal for a university to discriminate ? the protesters must next take their demands to @entity3 's legislature			0
discrimination based on sexual orientation has no place in @entity12 today			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

@entity2 told employees to sign an anti-gay pledge or lose their jobs
@entity158 : in 29 states , you can still be discriminated against , fired for being gay
@entity168 : @entity19 needs to pass 37 - year - old @entity14
it 's not a choice , he writes ; people are born into sexual orientation and identity
