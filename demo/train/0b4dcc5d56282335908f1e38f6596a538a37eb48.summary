lessons from the zoo : here are four surprising animal facts only zookeepers know			1
from dr. @entity6 to @entity7 , pop culture has made life with wild animals look like a blast			1
but for those who work there , a day at the zoo is no picnic			1
in the forthcoming episode of " @entity17 , " @entity0 host @entity15 becomes the latest human to weave his way within the fur and feathers , trying his hand as a zookeeper			2
for those looking to follow in @entity15 's dung - encrusted footsteps , here are a few lessons best learned ahead of time : 1			1
if a gorilla is pursing his ( or her ) lips , it 's best to direct thine eyes in another direction as @entity15 learned in his visit to the @entity38 -- a facility that 's been home to animals for nearly a century -- gorillas interpret direct eye contact as a threat			1
" so usually you look chest high on them , or directly past them , " one experienced zookeeper told @entity15			2
otherwise , you may find yourself staring at what she said is known as " threat face			2
" " they stand very rigid and very tall and then purse their lips , and really very tight			2
" when giving up anywhere between 200 and 300 pounds , " threat face " does n't exactly put a smile on an amateur zookeeper 's own kisser			2
if you 're working with penguins , bring your own eggs in captivity , penguins are n't permitted to nest atop their own eggs , for fear they 'll break			1
instead , when breeding season concludes , the zoos pull the real eggs and transport them to their own incubation room and nursery			2
fake eggs are put in their place , leaving the penguins to wonder why nothing has hatched			0
" they 'll kind of hang out for a couple more days and then they are often completely forgotten , " a penguin handler said			0
the zoo 's argument is that separating the chicks from the mother penguin serves to further grow the population			1
but @entity15 was uneasy about the arrangement : " i found it a little bit concerning that the penguins were being raised in incubators away from their parents , only to live lives entirely in captivity			0
if you have a thing for elephants , it might be best to seek the experience elsewhere zoos are n't a great place to house elephants , largely because of , well , their largeness			0
elephants are meant to be moving , roaming , eating , exploring			0
kept in captivity , the mammoth mammal will develop a variety of health concerns , many having to do with the feet and toes			0
it 's a lesson learned by the staff in @entity38 , resulting in what was likely quite a road trip			1
" they would have to be cooped up inside for months at a time and we just felt that that 's wrong			1
we knew they were suffering , " explained @entity117			0
" after a lot of , you know , heartache we finally said what 's best for them is to do this , and ultimately were successful and sent them to a fabulous sanctuary in @entity126			0
" after traveling from the @entity128 to the @entity129 , the elephants picked up an additional 2,000 acres through which to meander			0
" here there are no cages and no visitors ... just a lot of space to roam free , " explained @entity15			0
" while ' @entity137 ' unfortunately passed away a few years ago , ' @entity136 ' seems to be enjoying her life away from the crowds			1
when it comes to food , mother ( nature ) knows best in the @entity38 , veterinarians have noticed an increase in heart disease , a condition that likely stems from a combination of factors , including diet			0
while zookeepers try to replicate the gorillas ' natural fare , they can only come so close			0
" well , although we 're feeding them vegetables like they would get in the wild , it 's not the same plants that they would be getting in the wild , " said @entity154 , chief veterinarian at the @entity38			1
" you 've seen they get a lot of leaves , but i do n't think they 're getting romaine in their wild habitats			1
" the altered food source , plus confinement and genetics , has yielded ailments not found in freer versions of the species			0
it 's an equation that left @entity15 wondering about the existence of zoos			0
" it 's pretty disappointing to hear that they are suffering from heart disease , an illness they likely would n't have in the wild , " he said			1
" it really makes me question why we would want to keep breeding more animals in captivity who may suffer the same fate			2
