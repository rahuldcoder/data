@entity0 -- if you want to save souls , first you need to put folks in the pews			0
it works the same way with libraries , which -- without patrons -- are just large and imposing buildings full of dust and unread books , begging to be shut down by local officials the next time budgets are awash in red ink			1
still , even for those who would like to see libraries kept open , it 's worth asking : " at what cost ? " @entity18 are sure to be horrified at the news that , in a trend that seems to be growing in popularity , more and more public libraries in the @entity21 are supplementing their supply of books on science , history and literature with video games and big - screen televisions			1
what 's wrong with this picture ? those are the types of electronic gadgets that , we have long been told , distract people and prevent them from reading -- especially teenagers with short attention spans			1
so what are they doing inside an increasing number of public libraries in the @entity21 ? it would seem that this is the last place they ought to be			1
the worldwide video game industry is projected to gobble up more than $ 70 billion by 2015			1
ca n't there be one refuge from this tidal wave , and should n't it be a library ? maybe not			0
i admit that , when i first heard this story , my initial reaction was a wince			0
call me old - fashioned			0
when i was a teenager , i liked spending time in arcades and in libraries , and yet i never confused the two venues			1
but the more i heard , the more supportive i became of libraries that go down this road			2
and i realized that this is just the normal evolution of the worlds of learning and entertainment			0
school for autistic adult teaches video game building video games are part of an elaborate attempt to lure teenagers into a library , in the hopes that , before they leave , they might actually crack open a book -- or even , dare to dream , check one out			1
the games have to be age - appropriate , and some are even educational in nature			2
according to a study published last year in @entity79 , about 15 % of libraries in the @entity21 now check out video games to anyone with a library card			1
and actual gaming within libraries themselves is believed to be far more common			2
judging from some librarians who could n't be happier with the results , the strategy is working			0
teenagers -- boys in particular -- are coming to the library			0
and , in those libraries that have video games , books are being checked out at a rate that exceeds what it was before the gamers arrived			1
it sounds counterintuitive , but what if it turns out that the best way to get teenagers to even step foot into a library is to sweeten the environment with a few digital gadgets			0
what 's the harm ? testing touchscreen tables in classrooms some might be uneasy with the concept , but what is new and different is n't necessarily wrong			2
those who work in libraries can provide some context			2
they point out that , 20 years ago , the debate was over having cds and @entity116 cassettes available for checkout			0
ten years ago , it was over whether libraries should carry dvds and install personal computers and provide patrons with access to the @entity123			2
and now it 's about video games			1
besides , it 's easy to criticize			2
but when was the last time any of these traditionalists even stepped foot in a library ? Â when i was growing up in the 1970s , libraries were where you went to read books and research papers			1
they were a portal to new and exciting worlds , a pathway to adventure			0
today , we do all that through electronic devices we can hold in the palm of our hand			0
public libraries could soon become just another relic of the past , like the full - service gas station , the five - and - dime and the soda fountain in the corner drugstore			0
for those who love books and value learning , that 's a depressing scenario worth fighting with every available weapon , and every conceivable strategy			0
game on ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

@entity159 : libraries are offering video games to lure younger crowd
he says traditionalists may view the move as libraries selling their soul
with all the *challenges* libraries face , the games make sense , he says
@entity159 : if games help prompt teens to read , that 's a *key* for *survival* of libraries
