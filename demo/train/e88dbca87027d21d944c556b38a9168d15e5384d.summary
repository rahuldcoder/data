-- @entity1 lost 40 pounds for december 's " @entity2 , " and @entity3 worked out for four hours a day to get ripped for " @entity4			2
" @entity5 , meanwhile , wanted so badly to get the role of innovation icon @entity7 right , he put himself in the hospital			1
the 35 - year - old actor became a fruitarian while filming @entity7 biopic , " @entity13 , " in an attempt to " understand some of his discipline , " @entity5 explained to @entity0			1
he picked up a book @entity7 once read by @entity18 called " @entity19 " and began to eat nothing but fruit , shedding 15 to 18 pounds in the process , according to " @entity13 " director @entity23			1
what the @entity7 movie got right , and wrong " ( @entity13 ) was a really disciplined guy in a lot of ways , around his work and his life and his relationships and his products , " @entity5 said			1
" and part of going on the diet was just to try to get an understanding of that			2
i did n't like it very much			0
it was really painful , ultimately			0
but it was really worth it , ' cause i think i gained a level of empathy towards that kind of discipline and focus that i do n't think i could have played the role without			1
" arriving friday , " @entity13 " traces @entity7 ' ascendance from college dropout to globally influential creator and will recount his founding of @entity51 along with @entity52 ( played by @entity53 )			1
as one of the more tech - savvy stars in @entity56 , @entity5 was initially nervous to portray someone he calls his " hero			1
" " i admire him , and i admire his work , " @entity5 told @entity0			2
" the scariest thing for me was that i wanted ... people to see my portrayal of him and see it as a portrayal that was honoring him and being honest about some of the flaws that he had			0
that was really a daunting task			0
" of course , @entity5 came to the part with a genetic advantage : the actor , who also stars on @entity74 ' " @entity78 , " shares a resemblance to the @entity76 , who died in october 2011			1
but according to director @entity23 , @entity5 did n't try to rely on just his looks			2
" @entity5 walked into the first meeting already channeling @entity7 , " he told @entity0			1
" he had the mannerisms ; he 'd studied hundreds of hours			2
he knew from that first meeting that i needed to take away evidence that he could play the part			0
" @entity5 's total immersion into the character was so complete that @entity23 walked away from the actor with newfound respect			1
" he studied the guy ; he lived in his skin every day , which was n't the easiest place to live , and i really respect him quite a bit			0
he gave everything he had , and more than anything i knew that this role was important to him			2
and when something 's important to you no matter what you do , you 're going to give it everything you have			0
" despite those efforts , " @entity13 " has faced criticism ahead of its release date , from @entity5 's casting on down			1
the biopic was originally slated to bow in april , but was bumped back to august reportedly so the studio could have a longer marketing push			0
reviews , thus far , have been mixed , and then there are those questioning its timing			0
@entity5 says that when he received the script , which was already a work in progress when @entity7 died , that he did have that " immediate concern			1
" " i know that there were some people that were close to him who did n't want a movie to be made this soon , " he said , but because " i have friends that actually know him , i felt ... i could at least protect his legacy somewhat by playing ( the part ) , and i knew i would dedicate myself to making it as good as i could			0
" when you make as great of an impact on the world as @entity7 did , that story 's going to be told eventually , no matter what			1
" i would rather have it get told before the tales about him get too tall and while we could tell an honest story , " @entity5 continued			2
" a lot of times , someone passes away and all of a sudden the stories become these fictional tellings of what happened			0
i think this film is as close to true as we could find			0
" at this year 's @entity150 , @entity5 addressed the young crowd in a @entity7 - ian motivational moment			1
he told fans " sexy is smart , " " opportunities look a whole lot like work " and closed his speech by saying , " build a life ; do n't live one			0
" @entity0 's @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
