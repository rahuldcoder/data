on monday , @entity1 's long - awaited report into the death of @entity3 in the city of @entity5 two years ago was leaked in full to @entity6			1
the independent @entity7 was established by @entity1 's parliament to investigate what for many @entity1 was an embarrassing double national humiliation			1
first , that @entity3 lived in @entity1 for nine years undetected before he was killed			1
second , that the @entity11 conducted a military operation inside @entity1 that , from the moment that four @entity11 helicopters penetrated @entity1 's airspace , lasted for more than three hours without detection by the @entity1 military			1
in more than 300 pages , the report paints an intimate picture of the final days and years of the leader of @entity22 and is also a devastating indictment of what it describes as the incompetence of many institutions of the @entity1 state			1
a senior @entity1 government official told @entity30 the @entity7 report is authentic			1
report : @entity3 -- doting grandpa , paranoid terrorist the night of the raid the report describes the " fateful night " of may 2 , 2011 , when @entity3 was killed by a @entity37 seal team and begins with a flourish out of a @entity40 romance : " today was @entity42 's turn for the @entity43 ] to be with her			1
she was the youngest of his wives			0
" the report goes on to describe in almost minute - by - minute detail the @entity36 raid on the bin laden compound in @entity5 , which , it estimates , took between 36 and 38 minutes			0
@entity3 and @entity42 were sleeping in their top floor bedroom with their 3 - year - old son @entity55 when they were startled awake by a noise that sounded like a " a storm , " the report recounts			2
@entity42 reached to turn on the light in the bedroom but @entity3 told her : " no ! " soon @entity3 and his young wife were joined by two of @entity3 's adult daughters			1
together they quickly recited verses of the @entity68 and @entity3 informed them that @entity11 helicopters had arrived			0
he ordered his children to leave his bedroom			0
suddenly , an @entity11 soldier appeared in the room			0
@entity42 saw a red beam of light from the laser of the soldier 's gun but she heard no sounds , as the weapon had a silencer			0
@entity42 rushed the soldier who shot her " in the knee , " the report says			0
a shot from the @entity11			0
soldier hit @entity3 in the head and he died at around 12:50 a.m. on may 2 , 2011 , according to the report			2
the report -- by four retired senior @entity1 military , diplomatic , police and judicial officials -- is based on 201 interviews of government officials and other witnesses			2
@entity3 's death : how the story unfolded an obsession with security @entity3 went to great lengths to avoid detection , according to the report 's description			1
when he left his three - story residence to tour his @entity5 compound , he wore a cowboy hat that prevented prying eyes or satellites from recognizing him			0
@entity3 's two bodyguards also practiced careful operational security , making phone calls from public call booths in cities at least an hour 's drive from the @entity5 compound , where they lived with @entity22 's leader			1
when one of the bodyguard 's young daughters saw a picture of @entity3 on a television program and recognized him to be the tall @entity124 man who was living on the @entity5 compound , the report says , the bodyguard banned any further tv watching and any subsequent contact between his family and the bin laden family			1
after the arrest of 9/11 operational commander @entity131 in @entity1 in march 2003 , @entity3 decided to stop meeting with any @entity22 members in person , with the exception of his two bodyguards			2
during @entity3 's nine years on the run , his wife @entity136 gave birth to four children in @entity1			1
to avoid any troublesome questions , when @entity42 gave birth in a hospital the nurses and doctors were informed that she was " deaf and dumb			0
" the @entity3 bodyguards installed four separate gas and electricity meters at the @entity5 compound to ensure that there was n't ever a suspiciously large gas or electricity bill betraying the presence of the 16 members of the bin laden family			0
despite @entity3 complaints of pains in his heart or kidney he never saw a doctor , preferring to treat these ailments with " traditional @entity124 medicine , " the report says			2
when @entity3 traveled around @entity1 , which he did relatively frequently in the early years of his life on the run , he shaved off his distinctive beard			1
opinion : from @entity3 to @entity167 the @entity168 the report shows @entity3 to be an involved father and grandfather to the dozen or so of his children and grandchildren who were living at the @entity5 compound			2
he supervised their playtime , which included cultivating vegetable plots and he handed out " prizes for best performance			0
" @entity3 was also strict when it came to his @entity182 beliefs			0
in the @entity3 family , girls were completely separated from males at the unusually early age of three			0
and even when men appeared on tv , the @entity3 women would leave the room			0
for the scion of one of the richest families in the @entity195 , @entity3 certainly was careful with money			0
he had only a few changes of clothes and was paying the two bodyguards who were his only connection to the outside world around $ 100 a month each , according to the report			0
the @entity203 the @entity5 commission also examined the recruitment of @entity1 doctor @entity206 , who , according to the commissioners , was paid 10 million rupees by the @entity203 -- around $ 100,000 -- to mount a hepatitis - b vaccination program in @entity5			1
the aim was to confirm the presence of @entity3 at his suspected hideout by extracting blood samples from his children			0
the @entity203 hoped to compare that dna to @entity214 the @entity11 government had already obtained from other members of the bin laden family			2
@entity206 met with @entity203 officials on a number of occasions , including with two female operatives named " @entity222 " and " @entity223 , " who posed as officials with the @entity226			0
dr. @entity206 's @entity203 handlers provided him with a satellite radio so they could stay in touch with him and easily track him			2
two weeks before @entity3 was killed , dr. @entity206 arrived outside the bin laden compound			0
he called one of @entity3 's bodyguards on the phone seeking entry , but the bodyguard told him there that no one was at home			1
the @entity203 plans to extract blood samples from the @entity3 kids never panned out			2
@entity206 is now serving a 33 - year prison term in @entity1 for what the independent report characterizes as the " trumped - up charges " of providing support to the @entity246			2
opinion : who really killed @entity3 ? @entity1 government failures the report found that the at the time of the raid on @entity3 's compound , the @entity251 was focused on its traditional @entity256 enemy on its eastern border and its radar systems were in " peacetime mode " on its western border with @entity261			1
this helped explain how the @entity11 was able to insert four helicopters into @entity1 without detection			0
when the @entity251 finally scrambled jets to intercept the @entity11 helicopters they were long gone from @entity5			0
the report faults local officials in @entity5 for their " collective incompetence and negligence " for not paying more attention to the mysterious compound where @entity3 was hiding out			1
and it faults @entity1 's intelligence agencies for not mounting any kind of serious effort to discover if @entity3 was living in @entity1			1
the report also lambastes the same intelligence agencies for not detecting the " nationwide @entity203 network " in @entity1			1
on two occasions the report makes reference to @entity3 's " diary " which was recovered at the @entity5 compound			1
hopefully , the @entity11 or @entity1 government will at some point make public the contents of that diary , which will doubtless provide important new insights about the life and thinking of @entity22 's founder .			1

@entity295 : @entity296 gives intimate picture of @entity3 's life hiding in @entity1
he says it 's sharp indictment of what report calls @entity1 intelligence 's " incompetence "
it recounts @entity3 's daily life , tactics to evade discovery , and the drama of the night of the raid
@entity313 : it calls out @entity203 ploys that used doctor to help find @entity3 ; fault 's local government
