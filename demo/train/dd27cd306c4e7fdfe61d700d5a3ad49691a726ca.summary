taking your baby along to a new play group can be nerve - wracking			1
you do n't want any fuss , you just want to blend in			2
you hope and pray that your kid is n't the one who screams , hits or breaks something			2
all you want is to slip in , sit down and be told how beautiful and well - behaved your little one is			0
@entity8 was put to the test wednesday at a specially convened play group in @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13			1
the 8 - month - old was never going to just slip in , because he had brought the world 's media with him			1
but he did n't scream , hit or break anything ... just one incident of theft			1
@entity20 was playing with a plastic block			0
@entity8 grabbed it , @entity20 screamed , and mr. and mrs. @entity23 apologized to the @entity25			1
they later explained that @entity20 had hurt herself by biting down too hard on the toy			0
" this one was chewing on a toy , and she 's teething , so she bit it , and it obviously hurt her			0
she dropped it , and the toy got flogged , and that was the end of it , " her father said			0
there were no hard feelings , and the @entity39 are hoping @entity20 will stay in touch with her new @entity42 playmate			0
a royal wedding in 30 years ' time ? the event was organized by the parental support group , @entity46 , and a diverse group of families was invited , including a single mom and gay couple			0
all the 10 babies attending were born within a few weeks of @entity8			1
he was the biggest : " quite a bruiser , " said one onlooker			1
parent @entity54 said the @entity55 and @entity25 were " lovely first - time parents			1
" " in many ways , they 're in the same boat as all of us who are trying to get used to it , and it was just very nice to have a relaxed time , " he said , describing young @entity8 as " very intrepid			2
" the playgroup was @entity8 's main event in @entity13			1
we do n't expect to see him at another engagement until the tour moves on to @entity71			1
this event was typically informal for @entity73 and @entity25 , who swapped parental anecdotes ( @entity8 is finally sleeping through the night , apparently )			1
it may have felt like a regular play group , but of course , it was n't			2
who knows what most of them will do when they grow up			0
the world is their oyster			0
one of them , though , has had his whole life mapped out for him			0
@entity8 is destined to be their king			2
he has n't got a clue about that yet , of course			0
in fact , it 's the only time in his life that he will feel normal			0
for @entity8 , it was just a play date			1
@entity8 's first royal tour : the kid 's a natural portrait of @entity8 at eight months			2
