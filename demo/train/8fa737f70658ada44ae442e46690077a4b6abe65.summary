@entity0 -- small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- will once again be allowed in @entity11 planes , the head of the @entity3 said tuesday			1
knives with blades that are 2.36 inches ( 6 centimeters ) or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be permitted on @entity11 airline flights as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place			2
razor blades and box cutters are still not permitted			0
two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks or pool cues -- will also be allowed in carry - on luggage			2
@entity3 head @entity27 said the changes will take effect april 25 and will bring the @entity11 into alignment with international rules			1
some security experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors , better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen - knives unnecessary			1
@entity27 said the changes are in keeping with his " risk - based security " initiative and will permit airport screeners to focus on looking for bomb components , which present a greater threat to aircraft , instead of lesser threats			2
but a union representing 90,000 flight attendants called the measure " a poor and short - sighted decision by the @entity3			1
" " continued prohibition of these items is an integral layer in making our aviation system secure and must remain in place , " according to a statement by the @entity57			0
although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used " boxcutters " in their attack , the weapons were not recovered , and investigators believe other types of knives were used			0
at a january 2004 hearing of the @entity68 , a commission staff member said , " our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time -- permissible utility knives or pocket knives			0
" the commission displayed a @entity79 knife , saying , " we know that at least two knives like this were actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the belongings the hijackers left behind			0
" immediately after the attacks , the @entity3 prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft , but it has gradually been reintroducing some banned items such as cigarette lighters and matches			1
on occasion , such as a liquid bomb scare in august 2006 , the @entity3 has expanded the list , banning large containers of liquids and gels			2
under the @entity3 's risk - based security , @entity96 has sought to " reduce the haystack , " giving modified screening to travelers under age 12 and over age 75			1
it has also expanded its @entity105 initiative , which expedites checks of known passengers			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity108 said the changes announced tuesday will not slow down the screening process by requiring screeners to measure knife blades and weigh plastic bats			2
screeners will use " common sense " when applying the rule , he said			0
a major pilot 's union on tuesday declined to comment on the specific changes announced by the @entity3 , saying it had not had time to study them			1
but it applauded the @entity3 's efforts to harmonize @entity11 rules with those overseas , and its embrace of risk - based security			1
" unfortunately , the reality has been that we 've had this patchwork of regulations and systems that in some part ... have been carried on the shoulders of the airlines , " said capt. @entity128 , first vice president of the @entity129			0
@entity128 said risk - based security benefits the industry , the airlines and travelers .			0

the @entity3 will allow certain knives and sports equipment on planes
better security , such as reinforced cockpit doors , allow for the change
a flight attendants ' union says the bans should have remained
