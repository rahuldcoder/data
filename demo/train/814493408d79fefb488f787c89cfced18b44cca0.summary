@entity0 has absorbed a fair degree of ridicule for his campaign proposal to build an @entity5 colony on the moon			1
before focusing the laughter solely on @entity8 , however , let 's recall that it is the declared policy of the @entity5 government to return a human being to the moon by 2020 , in preparation for sending a human astronaut to @entity16			1
if @entity8 is wrong ( and he is ) , he 's not wrong alone			1
as you read this , an international space station is orbiting @entity21 , staffed by a crew of six ( currently , three @entity23 , two @entity5 and one astronaut from the @entity25 )			1
cost to date : $ 100 billion			2
@entity5 's space agency , @entity26 , is developing a next - generation rocket capable of lofting human crews			1
the rocket remains on the ground , but its development costs have soared , from a projected $ 28 billion to $ 44 billion			0
and the purpose of all this commotion and expense ? it 's very hard to answer			2
the useful space science these days is done by unmanned probes and satellites : the @entity38 that returned amazing images of @entity40 and its moons ; the @entity43 mission to monitor the health of @entity21 's atmosphere ; the @entity47 mission now en route to @entity49			1
in november 2011 , @entity26 launched its latest @entity16 probe , @entity51			0
curiosity should reach @entity16 by august			0
here 's the great thing about all these missions : they do not need to be engineered to zero defect , and no plans need be made to return them home			1
unmanned space exploration need not worry about food and water or the effects of isolation and low - gravity on the human spirit and body			1
but once human beings are inserted , everything changes			0
lives are put at risk			0
and for what ? most of the research purpose of sending human beings into space is to test the effects of sending human beings into space			2
the missions exist to test whether the missions can continue			2
this seems the very definition of futility			0
human space flight originated as a symbolic competition during the @entity88 era			2
the development of nuclear weapons deterred the @entity5 and the @entity91 from the hot war they might otherwise have fought			0
instead , the two sides sought other ways to demonstrate their power , culminating in the race to the moon			2
if anyone had ever imagined that @entity91 communism was technologically or economically competitive with @entity5 democracy , that illusion was retired forever when @entity103 and his team touched the moon 's surface and then returned safely			1
these human missions to space were political and military , not scientific			1
their point made , their purpose ended			0
meanwhile , the microelectronic and robotics revolutions of the 1970s and after enabled better science to be done without any human presence at all			2
unfortunately , government agencies rarely end when their purposes do			0
@entity26 had originated to send men into space , and @entity26 ( and its congressional supporters ) were unwilling to abandon that mission merely because it no longer had any justification			1
new justifications had to be found ! the space shuttle was built to serve a space station that was built to give the space shuttle something to do			2
and if you asked , " why ? " you got an answer like this , from space enthusiast columnist @entity133 : " why do it ? it 's not for practicality			1
we did n't go to the moon to spin off cooling suits and freeze - dried fruit			1
any technological return is a bonus , not a reason			0
we go for the wonder and glory of it			0
or , to put it less grandly , for its immense possibilities			0
we choose to do such things , said @entity150 , ' not because they are easy , but because they are hard			0
' and when you do such magnificently hard things -- send sailing a @entity155 or a @entity103 -- you open new human possibility in ways utterly unpredictable			0
" with the greatest respect , " the wonder and glory of it " is not a very compelling answer to the question : " what do i get for my hundred billion bucks ? " especially since the " wonder " part can be better satisfied at vastly lower cost without human astronauts			0
the pictures from @entity40 are pretty wonderful , and so will be the pictures from @entity49 , and no astronaut was needed to capture them			0
the hard truth to deliver to the laid - off engineers on @entity176 's space coast is that space exploration is another industry where automation has reduced the number of human employees needed			1
to propose putting 13,000 human beings on the moon is a lot like proposing to return to the days when steel mills employed tens of thousands of people			1
it 's not a vision of the future			1
join the conversation on @entity192			0

@entity194 : @entity0 has *attracted* some ridicule for his plan for a moon colony
he says @entity8 is n't alone in proposing to spend money on *unnecessary* manned mission
@entity194 says science can be done more effectively , *cheaply* in space with unmanned missions
he says @entity8 's idea is n't a plan for the future , but rather nostalgia
