the players ' legal action drew a swift response from the @entity17			2
" while the subject matter is very serious , we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the @entity8 and the @entity33 have managed player safety over time , including with respect to head injuries and concussions , " said the @entity17 statement			1
" we intend to defend the case vigorously and have no further comment at this time			1
" former @entity17 all - star @entity40 is one of the 10 players to have taken the action against the league and its board of governors			1

" while every blow to the head is dangerous , plaintiffs did not know , and were not told by the @entity17 , how dangerous this repeated brain trauma is			0

" the players claim a series of updates to the rules made in 2004 , while creating a more exciting , marketable game , increased the number of violent in - game collisions			0
