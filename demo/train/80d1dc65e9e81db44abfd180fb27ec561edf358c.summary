@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 might have the most fragrant garage in the @entity6			1
the heady scent of hickory wood wafts from their rural home on @entity1 's busy @entity10 , catching the attention of hungry commuters who might expect to find a grandma tending the hearth or , even better , a pitmaster roasting a hog on the side of the road			1
what 's cooking , though , is something a little bit sweeter ( sorry , grandma ) : it 's falling @entity26 hickory syrup			1
never heard of hickory syrup ? neither had the @entity28 until a few years ago when a chance internet search turned up mentions of it			1
in 2011 , they showed up to the farmers market in nearby @entity32 , @entity1 , with 48 bottles of their new science project -- " which we felt was a little bit risky , " @entity3 says			1
the couple aim to sell 30,000 units this year			1
the @entity28 credit tapping into the market at the right time with all the right buzzwords : foraged , locally sourced and , most of all , unique			0
they 're the first to admit they did n't have a divine syrup destiny ; they 're just retirees looking to get by via trial and error -- a challenge that @entity51 of all ages face regularly			0
" everybody out there is looking for something new , " @entity3 says			1
" the difficulty is not necessarily producing the product , it 's about marketing the product			2
" the @entity28 are among a dozen or so hickory syrup producers nationwide ; in comparison , the maple syrup industry produced 3.17 million gallons in 2014 , according to the @entity51 @entity63			1
the @entity28 have built their business by intriguing the average consumer , who often associates the flavor of syrup strictly with maple or " pancake syrup " poured from a character - shaped bottle			2
" we say , ' you know what , if you just taste it			0
just taste the hickory , we just want you to have the hickory experience			2
you do n't have to buy it , ' " @entity4 says			2
they find that the flavor is all it takes to win over new customers -- not to mention the loyal following of @entity86 - area chefs who appreciate the syrup 's smoky , earthy undertones			1
" we do n't say it 's better or worse than maple ; it 's just a different culinary experience , " she says			2
the sugar content is similar to that of maple syrup , but the intensity of the sweetness is not there , @entity3 adds , which is why they suggest use in meat glazes or even cocktails			1
as the name suggests , hickory syrup is made from the bark of hickory trees -- shagbark hickory , to be exact			1
instead of boiling down tapped tree sap like maple or birch syrup makers would , the @entity28 craft their product by extracting flavors from the actual bark that 's been foraged from the forest floor			1
they scrub the bark clean , roast it over an open flame and then boil it with turbinado sugar to form a syrup			0
throughout the @entity28 ' 33 - year marriage , the couple have always looked to their hands -- and the land around them -- as a means of making a living			0
they grow and eat their own produce , hunt and cook their own game , and have even built most of their houses from the ground up			0
@entity4 says the initial plan was that if they could work a weekend producing syrup and make the same amount of money @entity3 was earning at his odd retirement jobs , they 'd take that idea to the next level and pursue it full time			1
three years later , the notion seems to have stuck			0
" i think the family that works together , stays together , " @entity3 says			2
at first , they experimented with compound butters and smoked salts			0
the smoking led them to looking into different woods to smoke -- from there they branched into hickory			0
" and then syrup just started happening , " @entity4 says			1
" and it 's continued to happen			0
we 're going to follow it wherever it takes us			0
" they individually bottle each unit in their home using a @entity159 coffee urn , and drive orders to the post office in their truck with a license plate that reads , " @entity164 " ( syrup happens )			0
people in their small rural community know them as the hickory syrup folks , and have started to chip in by letting the couple stop by and pick up any naturally shedding bark off their property			1
oftentimes , they come home to find bundles of hickory bark on their front porch like a basket of fresh baked goods from a new neighbor			0
" we just try to do the right thing , " @entity4 says			2
" i guess maybe all that 's karma			0
it 's come back around and starting to pay off			0
" an 8 - ounce bottle retails for around $ 9.99 , and the syrup is available nationwide in retailers such as @entity186 as well as in @entity188 's online store			1
" we do n't want to get too big , too fast , kind of like the cupcake industry , " @entity4 jokes			2
" we 're just taking it a step at a time			0
" besides , it 's just the two of them producing all the sticky stuff			0
" we 're just two simple senior citizens making syrup , " @entity4 says			1
for the @entity28 , at the moment , money really does grow on trees .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 started producing hickory syrup as an experiment
@entity207 syrup is similar to maple syrup , but it 's smokier and less sweet in taste
in three years , @entity188 went from selling 48 bottles of syrup a year to 30,000
