@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity3 likely will release her delegates to sen. @entity5 , a @entity7 official said sunday , the eve of the @entity9			1
sen. @entity3 will meet with her delegates on wednesday before that night 's roll call , a spokesman says			1
also sunday , the @entity7 decided delegates from @entity14 and @entity15 -- states that had been penalized for moving their 2008 presidential primaries to january -- will get full voting rights at the event			1
the moves answer some questions that lingered ahead of the convention , which starts monday in @entity0			2
@entity23 , who suspended her presidential campaign in june after @entity5 secured enough delegates to win the party 's nomination , will meet with her delegates at a reception in @entity0 on wednesday afternoon -- before that evening 's delegate vote on the nominee , said a @entity7 official who asked not to be named			1
" [ the reception is ] an opportunity for sen. @entity23 to see her delegates -- many for the first time since the primaries ended -- thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly , to encourage them to support and work for sen. @entity5 as strongly as she has , in order to elect him in november , " @entity23 spokesman @entity33 said			1
because @entity23 suspended her campaign instead of dropping out , she kept the pledged delegates she earned in the primaries and caucuses			1
earlier this month , @entity5 's campaign said it agreed to put @entity23 's name in nomination at the convention " in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nation 's primary contests			1
" watch a preview of the convention @entity23 already has urged the 18 million people who voted for her in the primaries to get behind @entity5			1
meanwhile , the @entity68 unanimously voted to end sanctions against @entity15 and @entity14			1
the party initially stripped @entity15 and @entity14 of their delegates for holding presidential primaries earlier than the party had wanted			1
however , in late may , the @entity9 's rules and bylaws committee voted to reinstate the delegates but give them each a half - vote			1
sunday 's decision gives the delegates a full vote at the convention			1
ending the sanctions had been a goal of @entity23 , who won @entity15 and @entity14 in her unsuccessful bid for the @entity7 presidential nomination			1
@entity5 endorsed lifting the sanctions after @entity23 's withdrawal from the race			2
between monday 's convention opening and thursday night 's acceptance speech by @entity5 at @entity0 's @entity94 , delegates are expected to ratify his nomination and that of his vice presidential pick , sen. @entity97 , another former primary rival			1
@entity5 faces @entity99 sen. @entity98 in november in the contest for the presidency			2
@entity98 's campaign has poked at the old @entity5 - @entity23 splits with a campaign ad claiming @entity23 was passed over for the no. 2 spot because she was too honest about @entity5 's perceived weaknesses			2
" the truth hurt , and @entity5 did n't like it , " @entity98 's ad says			2
but rep. @entity110 of @entity111 , an @entity5 supporter , told @entity113 ' " @entity112 " on sunday : " this campaign is not about @entity5 and @entity3			1
" " his campaign is about @entity116 and four more years of @entity116 under @entity98 , " @entity110 said			2
" that message is going to echo clearly from this platform			2
" a new @entity120 poll released sunday night showed that @entity5 's lead over @entity98 has evaporated			0
forty - seven percent of those questioned are backing @entity5 , with an equal amount supporting @entity98			0
taken after @entity97 's selection , the poll showed that the number of @entity23 @entity7 who said they would vote for @entity98 increased 11 points since june , enough to account for most of the support @entity98 gained			1
@entity23 fared better than @entity5 among working - class voters in many states during the primaries			2
@entity5 on sunday suggested the convention would help give those voters " a sense of who i am			0
" @entity5 said he hopes voters will conclude that he is " sort of like us			0
he [ @entity5 ] comes from a middle - class background			0
he went to school on scholarships , he had to pay off student loans			0
he and his wife had to worry about child care			0
" " you 'll find out : ' he 's pretty much like us , ' " @entity5 told supporters about himself , while campaigning in @entity145 on his way to @entity0			0
@entity5 hammered at @entity98 on the economy and on @entity98 's perceived strong suit , national security			0
@entity5 told supporters at a barbecue in @entity154 , @entity145 , " the @entity99 track record on national security has not been particularly good			0
" " my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure , " he said			0
" we need somebody who talks tough , who 's going to act smart and be tough			0
that 's how we 're going to look after the safety of the @entity167 people			0
" @entity169 gov. @entity168 , viewed as a potential @entity98 running mate , said @entity5 's decision to pick @entity97 -- the chairman of the @entity173 -- was an acknowledgment that @entity5 lacked to national security chops to be president			0
" i do n't think he 's ready to be president			0
and when you 're commander - in - chief , you should n't be having to select a mentor to help you with that role , " @entity168 told @entity2 's " @entity181			0
" @entity2 's @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
