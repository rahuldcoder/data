-- when @entity2 exploded off @entity3 in 1996 , it took more than a year to recover the bodies of all 230 passengers and crew			2
after suicide hijackers destroyed the @entity9 in 2001 , it took a decade or more for investigators to identify the fragmentary remains of some of those killed			2
some have never been identified			2
and when the drill rig @entity17 burned and sank off @entity18 in 2010 , the bodies of 11 men were never found			2
at a memorial service two months later , each family was presented with a bronze hardhat to represent their loss			2
now , it 's the loved ones of the 239 people aboard @entity27 who face what one expert called the " unspeakable challenge " of grieving for someone whose final resting place may never be found			1
they " will have to reconcile what is for most of us unimaginable , " said @entity33 , a psychologist who specializes in aiding disaster survivors			1
" they will have to somehow find a way to put their minds at peace , to let go of the idea that the body of their loved one is going to be recovered , " he said			2
" or there may be bits and pieces of things that are recovered , but there is a chance that they may not			2
and it may not ever be enough or satisfying , and they 're going to have to find peace in some other way			2
" @entity58 , whose fiance was killed on the @entity61 jet , said one of the hardest moments for her was when authorities closed the center that assisted families before the body of her fiance , @entity68 , had been found			1
@entity69 treads carefully amid anger and grief of relatives " i had to go home and go back to life as normal , but it was not normal , " @entity58 told @entity0 's " @entity76			1
" " you kind of have to start all over again , and also start again with the grieving process without really having hope to hold on to , but also not really having concrete evidence either that they 're gone , " she said			1
" so there 's still that moment of fluctuating back and forth , and still holding out some hope			1
" @entity85 is now the head of @entity87 , or @entity87 , which offers counseling and help to the surviving relatives of crash victims			0
authorities are now combing thousands of square miles of the @entity93 in search of the wreckage of flight 370			0
the @entity97 has been missing since the early - morning hours of march 8 , and @entity99 authorities declared monday that it had most likely been lost with all aboard in the remote sea far off @entity101			1
best lead yet ? satellite spots possible debris most of the passengers on the @entity107 - to - @entity108 flight were @entity69 , some sole sons or daughters under @entity69 's longstanding one - child policy			1
others were mothers and fathers themselves			0
@entity114 , whose husband interrupted a vacation in @entity99 to return to @entity108 for business , said she has n't been able to bring herself to tell her two young sons that daddy may not come home			0
mystery surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy " i have no courage , " she said			1
" every day , i am scared to call my sons because once i call them , they will cry out " @entity125 , @entity126 , " and my heart ca n't handle it			0
i do n't want to hurt my children			0
" @entity130 , a clinical psychiatrist , said the families had been asked to keep their hopes up before monday -- " and even as the confirmation came , there is no definitive evidence			0
" " that 's even harder for the families to put an end point to this journey for themselves , " @entity136 said			1
text fail when delivering tragic news @entity33 said families of flight 370 are stuck in a state he called a " living loss , " trying to make sense of the few bits of information that are now known			0
" it is grieving , except it 's even more torturous in some ways , because we do n't know whether they 've died , " he said			1
" our minds are like computers going wild in search mode , and yet we do n't know what happened			0
but at the same time , they 're coming to some degree of resignation that they will most likely have to go on and spend the rest of their lives without someone they love			0
" @entity33 founded a grief - counseling group , the @entity167 , after his daughter was killed in a 1996 bus crash in @entity170			0
he worked with the families of the @entity61 crash and the september 11 , 2001 , @entity174 attack that brought down the @entity9 , killing more than 2,700			1
between 5 % and 10 % of the families the foundation has helped have had loved ones disappear , he said			0
and until the sea gives up its secrets , the families of flight 370 will be facing the same woes			0
" they will have to find a way to hold their loved ones in their hearts , good thoughts and prayers and allow that to be enough , " @entity33 said			0
" that 's no easy task			1
but that is a challenge -- the unspeakable challenge -- that people who 've had to endure this kind of loss must face , and it is attainable			0
