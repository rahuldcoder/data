-- i count 105 football movies on @entity5 's " list of sports films			1
" there is a 1998 one called " @entity7 , " a title i know nothing about , except that it obviously had no use for commas or hyphens			2
there is a silent one , 1925 's " @entity20 , " about a milquetoast whose teammates use him in practice as a tackling dummy			2
there is a 1976 one called " @entity22 , " about a mule who kicks field goals			2
( not a true story , i believe			2
) the 105th ( chronologically ) on this list is " @entity37 , " a tale of a fictional @entity31 executive -- he is played by @entity32 , king of sports cinema -- that opens friday at a theater near you			1
from the trailer i have seen , it looks pretty good			0
raising the question : has there ever been a great football movie ? i mean truly great , not just good			1
a film you seriously could rank among your 100 best of all time			0
all right , all right , all right , as @entity48 would say , let 's take a look at some of those 105 movies on this here list			1
( " @entity65 " is the category , which is just to let our @entity0 friends in @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 know that you can go look for your favorite football films under the category " soccer			1
" ) ok , for openers , what does and does n't qualify as a football film ? for example , " @entity72 " ( 2012 ) is not , even though its title sure does sound like one			1
football gets talked about a lot , but a football movie , it is not			1
" @entity79 " ( 1970 ) also is not , even though it ends with a football game			1
the movie itself had nothing to do with football			1
" @entity85 " ( 1932 ) ends with a game			0
it makes the list , if only because professor @entity88 ( @entity89 ) wants to know : " have we got a college ? have we got a football team ? well , we ca n't afford both			1
tomorrow we start tearing down the college ! " there are two versions of " @entity97 " ( 1974 and 2005 ) , two of " @entity100 " ( 1971 and 2001 ) , two about legendary @entity102 coach @entity101 ( 1984 and 2002 ) , one of which has @entity98 played by the somewhat less legendary @entity105			0
there are " true " stories about @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and more , some of which contain scenes that are actually factual			0
in " @entity120 " ( 2006 ) , a bartender ( played by @entity119 ) named @entity121 ( as in invincible ) gets to play for the @entity122			0
in " @entity126 " ( 1968 ) , the writer @entity124 ( played by @entity125 ) gets to play for the @entity127			0
it was actually in a team scrimmage , not in an @entity31 exhibition game , as in the film			0
there is 1993 's " @entity134 , " about a small dude ( played by @entity136 ) who gets to play with a @entity138 team made up mainly of big dudes			0
there is 1981 's " @entity141 , " in which a white dude ( played by master thespian @entity143 ) gets to play with a college team made up mainly of black dudes			0
a couple star the @entity148			0
i like both these actors , although both would have been badly miscast playing @entity134			0
a couple star @entity152 , who actually played a little football in school			1
@entity155 , who probably did not play a lot of football in school , won an @entity159 for 2009 's " @entity160 , " in which she demonstrates to future @entity31 star @entity161 how to throw a block			1
@entity161 later wondered " why the director chose to show me as someone who had to be taught the game of football			2
" because that 's show biz ! @entity32 's new one , " @entity37 , " concerns the @entity31 's @entity170 , with their general manager maneuvering to acquire the no. 1 pick of the college player draft			1
the @entity170 need any help they can get , never having won a @entity175			0
i appreciate that in @entity32 's career he has played cowboys , lawyers , naval officers , @entity180 , @entity181 and guys obsessed with @entity183			1
i am nevertheless always pleased to find him in a sport - related role			2
i 'd watch him do anything , except maybe fight @entity189 or play soccer			0
has there ever been a football film classic , you ask ? hmmm , probably not the one with a team coached by @entity195 , nor the one with a team coached by @entity197			2
oh , and probably not " @entity205 " ( 1984 ) , a remake of the film - noir mystery " out of the past , " for which instead of a private detective , the main character was changed by some @entity202 genius to -- duh -- a pro football team 's injured wide receiver ! ah , but a few keepers do exist			1
a half - dozen , in no particular order : -- " @entity218 " ( 1983 ) was a drama about a high school kid , good , not great , played by a young @entity212 , who basically finds out that if your coach feels like it , he sure can mess up the rest of your life			1
-- " @entity229 " ( 1979 ) was a realistic look , with plenty of farce thrown in , at the behind - the - scenes activities of a pro football team , including a martinet of a coach and a number of players who indulge in very unsportsmanlike conduct			1
-- " @entity233 , 29 - 29 " ( 2008 ) is a documentary , often as witty as the headline that inspired it			1
it looks back on a november 23 , 1968 , football game unforgettable to everybody involved in it , including a @entity233 lineman you might have seen in another movie or two , @entity241			1
-- " @entity100 " ( 1971 ) , the original , not that lame reboot of 30 years later , deals with teamwork , friendship , rivalry , race relations , terminal illness , you name it			0
acted impeccably by @entity252 and @entity253 , this was a fine bromance			0
-- " @entity260 " ( 1996 ) has had its cute lines regurgitated for so long -- " show me the money , " " you had me at hello " -- that its memorable premise is oft forgotten , that being the value of loyalty , to a partner , to a principle , to an employer , to a client			0
for a romantic comedy , it 's actually a pretty fair drama			0
-- " @entity279 " ( 2004 ) took a book that offended some of the good folks of @entity274 , @entity275 , exposing the lows as well as the highs of high school ball			0
in time , many came to accept what a significant story this is , in literature and film , the latter with a letter - perfect script and @entity289 cast			2
others out there in movie land might prefer the life lessons of 2000 's " @entity294			2
" or even a fossilized relic like 1940 's " @entity296 , " in which a dying 25 - year - old @entity297 ( played by @entity298 ) tells his old coach @entity300 to " go out there with all they 've got and win just one for the @entity297 , " which they do			2
me , i 'd remake that one			0
@entity32 could do a great @entity300 .			1

a new football movie , " @entity37 , " is opening , starring @entity32
@entity311 : has there ever been a great football movie ?
@entity5 lists 105 football movies , most of them forgettable
he says there are a few *standouts* , including " @entity233 , 29 - 29 "
