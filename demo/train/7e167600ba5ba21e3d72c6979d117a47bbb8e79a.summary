-- @entity2 's recipe to alleviate the often crippling effects of multiple sclerosis is a curious concoction			1
it consists of one year , 366 marathons , 15,442 kilometers and 20 pairs of running shoes			1
" it 's amazing because now i know i have a diagnosis , but i know i feel healthy and i am healthy , i have no disease , " she told @entity0 's human to @entity12			1
" i know my body now and i also listened to my body every day during the project , so i have no fear at all			1
" my muscles got stronger during the project and also my bones got stronger and my body found a balance , so i 'm in good shape			1
" it was n't always this way , though			2
the @entity28 was diagnosed with @entity29 three years ago			1
the disease -- which attacks the body 's central nervous system -- has several forms , ranging in seriousness			2
like 85 per cent of sufferers , @entity2 has relapsing remitting @entity29 , which means symptoms can appear then fade away , either partially or completely			1
initially , it enveloped the 41 - year - old , prompting a six - month spell of introspection and fear			1
as well as numbness down her left side , she was also blighted with dizziness and extreme tiredness			2
" at one point i was really sad about that and i was feeling sorry for myself , " @entity2 explained			1
" some days were very hard and i thought , ' what am i going to do ? i ca n't work , i 'm so tired and i 'm going to sit in a wheelchair			2
' " other days i thought , ' well , this is going to be ok , i 'll handle it			2
' so i had six months on a rollercoaster ride , you could say			2
" then i got my act together and i thought , ' i 'm feeling sorry for myself and i 'm sick and it 's not the way i wanted things to be , but i can decide for myself what i am going to do from now			0
' " the outlet for this enduring commitment to vitality was running -- a whole lot of running			0
having flirted with the sport at various stages of her life , @entity2 was a committed runner by the time her multiple sclerosis was confirmed			1
and it proved to be a valuable vehicle in her fight to remain physically and mentally fit			0
" the curiosity about our mind and our body is really a big motivation for me that started with my diagnosis , " said @entity2 , who has written a book about her feats			1
" it 's hard to explain what happened			0
before i would run once in a while and i could n't really get the hang of it , i did n't really enjoy it			0
but six years ago i was ready to fall in love with running			0
" even the most committed of athletes would surely tremble at the prospect of completing 26 miles every day for a whole year			2
but @entity2 says her decision was empowering , helping to reinforce her viewpoint that she could retain an important element of control over her disease			1
" a year after my first marathon , i was sitting in the car with my husband and thinking out loud , ' would n't it be amazing if i could run a marathon every day for a year ? ! ' " instead of just letting it go or not answering he said , ' if anybody can do it , it would be you			2
' " so the dream was alive			0
we talked about it , it just felt right in both our stomachs			0
i wanted to run and he wanted to support me			0
i 've learned that if there 's anything i want to do , i can do it			0
" it 's not every day i just jump out of bed and say , ' wow , this is a happy day , ' but i know if i wake up and feel my head is heavy , that i 'm not feeling so good , i know i can make it a good day anyway -- that 's my choice			0
" i can choose to be , ' oh , tell everybody i 'm not feeling so well , ' or i can tell myself , ' no , i want to feel good and tell everybody i 'm feeling good			0
' it 's my choice			0
that 's kind of a freedom			0
" even scrolling through the complete list of @entity2 's marathons on her website is exhausting			1
all of them were completed in @entity28 , most around the town of @entity128 stved			1
unsurprisingly , @entity2 's very first marathon was her quickest , clocking in at four hours , 25 minutes and 30 seconds			1
she drank two liters of soda a day to keep her body infused with sugar , got through a pair of running shoes every 18 days , and maintained an average time of around five hours			1
" there were lonely moments , because i was the only one doing this , " she explained			0
" sometimes i just felt so tired and thought , ' nobody knows what i 'm feeling right now , ' and that sometimes felt lonely			0
" also when people told me , ' you can do this , try that , ' and i thought you do n't know what you 're talking about because i 'm the only one who has tried to run a marathon and it 's hard -- i 'm tired ! " a glutton for punishment , @entity2 decided to run not one but two marathons on her 365th day , spending a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes pounding the roads			1
" when i got to the finish line , i had no words , " she said			0
" it was overwhelming , my head was empty			0
the only thing going through my mind was thank you for everything			0
" i ran over the finish line and my kids and my husband were there ready to hug me , and @entity169 and @entity170 they made a big sign saying , ' you are awesome mum ! ' " i just started crying -- it was the best day of my life			2
i have a lot of those but it 's going into history			0
" as you might have guessed , her marathon year is n't the limit of @entity2 's ambitions , and another assignment is already in the pipeline			1
" my next challenge in the running shoes is completing five marathons in 48 hours , " she reports .			1
