from craggy cliffs to broad sandy beaches , @entity0 is rightly proud of its thousands of miles of shoreline			1
but campaigners say great stretches of it are now under threat from a tide of trash that 's endangering wildlife and could impact visitors			2
the @entity0 's @entity12 ( @entity13 ) has published the results of its annual " big clean up , " which sees hundreds of volunteers take to the country 's beaches armed with garbage bags			1
the event , last september , saw more than 223,400 individual pieces of trash scooped from the shoreline -- the largest haul since the cleanups began 20 years ago			2
among the more bizarre items recovered were a @entity28 bulletproof vest , an unopened packet of bacon , a brass candlestick and , disturbingly , a set of dentures			1
ordinary people were seen as the biggest shoreline spoilers -- blamed for nearly 40 % of the trash washing up or blowing onto beaches			2
commercial and recreational fishing , shipping and sewage outlets are also blamed for detritus including nets , floats , used diapers and syringes			0
' disgusting tide ' @entity47 of @entity13 says the quantity of litter found was " disheartening			0
" " this is a disgusting tide of litter which is threatening the safety of beach visitors both human and animal			0
it 's coming in from the sea , being blown from the land or simply being dumped and dropped , " she said in a statement			0
@entity13 volunteers tackled more than 200 stretches of coast , which have been ranked from dirtiest to cleanest in terms of the number of sacks of trash filled			1
the worst offender was identified as @entity69 , a roadside shore near the southern @entity71 town of @entity72 , from which 60 sacks were filled			1
@entity74 , also near @entity75 , came second on the list , with 50 sacks			0
however , several other beaches on the same area of coastline were considerably cleaner , including a stretch of @entity82 that generated just 60 sacks			0
a tourism official in @entity75 told @entity84 that , despite @entity13 trash haul , the coastline around the city has some of @entity0 's cleanest beaches			1
this includes @entity90 , a wealthy enclave whose groomed sandy shore has been certified spotless by a @entity94 " blue flag " award for a record 26 successive years			0
of those tackled by @entity13 volunteers , the cleanest was identified as @entity98 , near the @entity100 city of @entity101 , which yielded just a quarter of a sack of trash			1
the top five cleanest also included : @entity105 , @entity106 ; @entity107 , @entity72 ; @entity108 , @entity109 ; and @entity110 , @entity109 .			0
