a new video released by @entity1 confirms the group 's senior leaders were closely involved in the plot to blow up a @entity6 airliner over @entity7 five years ago and that @entity6 - born cleric @entity8 was among them			1
the video , released by @entity1 's official media arm , shows a short clip of the " underwear " bomber , @entity13 , together with both the group 's leader , @entity17 , and @entity8			1
@entity18 is unable to confirm the authenticity of the clip , which is in slow motion and lasts barely five seconds			0
but @entity22 of @entity23 , which monitors jihadist media releases , says it appears to be genuine			0
a previous @entity1 video released in june showed @entity13 embracing @entity17 , who is now deputy to @entity1 leader @entity27			1
@entity13 's communications and meetings with @entity8 were previously known			2
but this video underlines the extent to which @entity8 was by the fall of 2009 closely involved with @entity1 's leadership			2
@entity13 , a @entity34 student , boarded a @entity36 flight from @entity37 to @entity7 on christmas day 2009 with a device hidden in his underpants			1
he was unable to detonate it as the airliner descended to its destination			0
the video -- some 30 minutes long -- is a compilation celebrating an important clan in central @entity46 , the @entity47 , and specifically three brothers , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
they had become prominent supporters of @entity1 and formed a friendship with @entity8 , who married their sister			2
one of the brothers , @entity47 , recruited @entity13 in the @entity46 capital and brought him to the attention of the @entity1 leadership in autumn 2009 , according to @entity22			1
during @entity13 's brief trial ( which ended abruptly when he changed his plea to guilty ) , it was disclosed that the @entity34 had told the @entity65 he had been introduced in @entity66 to an @entity1 operative named @entity68 , who became his principal handler			2
it seems @entity68 may in fact have been one of the @entity47 brothers			0
in late november 2009 , @entity68 enlisted @entity13 in @entity1 's plan to attack an @entity6 airliner			1
in releasing the video now , @entity1 is drawing attention to the role of @entity47 family members in its ongoing battles against @entity81 militia in @entity82 , and trying to rally support in what has become a draining war of attrition			2
battles between @entity1 fighters and @entity81 militia across a wide swath of central @entity46 are an almost daily occurrence			1
bomb attacks in @entity92 last week killed more than 20 people , including 15 girls on a bus			0
@entity1 was quick to blame the @entity81 for the girls ' deaths			0
the @entity81 , a @entity99 minority in @entity46 , seized control of @entity66 in september and have since pushed into central @entity46			1
they also control @entity46 's second port , @entity102 , on the @entity103			0
the video includes a quote from @entity8 , who says " the host for this jihad is the clan			0
in @entity109 the clan , in @entity111 the clan and in @entity113 the clan			0
" @entity1 needs the support of the tribes in its fight against the @entity81 , and has tried to cast the struggle as one between the @entity121 tribes and " heretical " @entity99 for the soul of @entity123			0
as for the @entity125 , @entity124 was killed last year , purportedly in a drone strike			0
@entity51 brought @entity128 law to the town of @entity92 in @entity82 in 2012 , but was then killed by his half - brother @entity130 , who had objected to @entity1 's presence in @entity92			2
the @entity1 video claims @entity133 killed @entity51 " with the support of the @entity46 regime and their masters the @entity6			1
