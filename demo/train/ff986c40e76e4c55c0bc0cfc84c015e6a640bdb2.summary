editor 's note : on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity2 goes outside the @entity6 to report on issues affecting communities across the country			2
county administrator @entity10 is trying hard to help create eight to 10 sawmill jobs for @entity12			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity5 ) -- the odds are against @entity10 , and she knows it			1
so she counts on what she calls the @entity18 : " take it one bite at a time			2
" @entity21 is the county administrator in @entity12 , a rural area in southwest @entity14 dotted with small churches , modest homes and markers noting a @entity26 skirmish			1
" it is a great small town , and everybody knows everybody , " @entity21 says			1
if you look through the statistics , three things jump out : the @entity33 lists the population of @entity12 as 86 percent @entity35 , the highest percentage of any county in the @entity38			1
it is the fourth - poorest county in the @entity38 , with a median income of $ 15,037			1
the unemployment rate in august was 18.6 percent , the highest of @entity14 's 82 counties			2
" it has not always been this way , " says @entity43 , a single mother of three who is among the unemployed			2
" i think we are forgotten			2
" @entity48 had a job making $ 10,000 a year as a teacher 's assistant , but she left it to take a job paying twice as much , signing on with a union that provides workers to nuclear power plants			1
her parents agreed to care for her children when she had to travel , for months at a time , as far away as @entity58			2
@entity48 thought it was the right thing to do for her family , but phone calls to home at bedtime proved otherwise			1
her 4 - year - old , especially , had a rough time adjusting			1
" i 'm like , ' you have @entity68			2
' he 's like , ' no , i do n't want @entity68 ; i want you to hold me , ' " @entity48 told us			2
" i missed @entity71 twice ; for two years i missed it			2
... so i decided that it was more important for me to be here with my children			2
" back home now , she has been searching for work since march , looking as far as 90 minutes away from @entity77			1
" i did internet searching , different jobs , hospitals , different schools , " she said			1
" they 're not hiring			2
they either say they are not hiring , or i 'm not qualified			0
i do n't have enough years of experience			0
' we 'll call you later			0
' ' get back with us			0
' and it 's been stressful for me			0
" @entity21 spends hours a day trying to help , and most of her time with the board of supervisors is spent debating economic development ideas			0
at home , too , she is reminded of the bleak local jobs market			1
her husband is n't there			0
he 's working 900 miles away , at the moment , in @entity98			0
" he works with a company that has been going into a lot of the car plants " during refittings and downsizing , @entity21 said			0
" we have four kids			0
... he is here basically maybe a total combination of , maybe , two months out of the year			0
" the county got a modest amount of federal money to buy new police cruisers			1
but its requests for stimulus money to improve its roads have been ignored , at least to date , and as @entity21 continues to press those requests , she also is pushing smaller economic development grants			0
@entity117 is her current obsession			0
the screeching hum of a giant saw greets visitors , and inside the warehouse are dozens of pallets of neatly stacked firewood , waiting to be loaded on 18 - wheelers and distributed across the country for the coming winter			1
on the grounds , there are 10 workers , some running giant logs through the saw , others stacking and wrapping the wood for shipment			0
on average , the men make about $ 100 day , and @entity135 , the company 's general manager , says the noise and activity attracts others who are down on their luck			0
" i see a lot of people come by looking for jobs , yeah , " @entity135 says during a tour of the grounds			1
the company 's main product is giant wooden mats used to create flat surfaces to provide access -- on foot and in vehicles -- to oil and gas fields			0
all of the work has shifted to the firewood production because orders for the mats have dropped dramatically			0
" @entity14 is always last to feel the effects of a recession , and most of the time it is the last to pick back up , " @entity135 said			1
" it hit us about june			1
it really hit us hard , too			1
" still , @entity135 expects orders to pick up early next year			0
he hopes to expand the business by then if the county secures an economic development grant to help him buy a bigger sawmill			1
" if we had that sawmill , we would be able to add eight or 10 more folks , " @entity135 said			0
eight or 10 more jobs might not seem like much in many places			1
but @entity12 's population is just shy of 9,000 , and when nearly one in five are unemployed , @entity21 invokes her @entity18			1
" my short term goal is to get that grant , to get those eight people working , " she says			0
" my philosophy , when i walk through the doors in the morning , just like a sandwich : take one bite at a time			0
" she also sees a bigger gain than just eight or 10 jobs			1
" just imagine , eight people , if it were eight men making $ 10 to $ 11 an hour could actually come home and be home at night with their families , " she said			1
" the impact that it would make not just from the economical standpoint but from the social standpoint			0
" that father 's presence there in that household and not having to travel so far			0
i mean you have a double whammy			0
it 's a win - win for any family			2

@entity12 is fourth - poorest in @entity38 ; the recession came late but hit hard
sometimes , *breadwinners* must leave state , and their families , to scrape by
county administrator @entity10 wants to bring jobs close to home
she considers every new job created in her county a small *victory*
