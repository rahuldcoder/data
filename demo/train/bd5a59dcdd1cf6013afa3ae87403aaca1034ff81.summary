-- there are no pure " winner - take - all " contests on @entity3 , but almost all of the 10 states holding contests on the biggest day of the primary season offer candidates some chance of shutting out their opponents in the all - important race to amass delegates			1
@entity12 is the most plausible beneficiary of the states ' complex allocation rules			1
if the former @entity16 governor can rack up enough of the vote in @entity18 , @entity16 , @entity19 and @entity20 , he stands to be the sole winner of the combined 133 delegates from those states , almost a third of the 419 delegates up for grabs on @entity3			1
former house speaker @entity27 has a chance of picking up all of @entity30 's 76 delegates , according to recent polling			1
@entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 also offer candidates an opportunity to receive all of the delegates available from those states , although various party rules make this a much less likely outcome in these states			1
here 's a state - by - state breakdown of the " winner - take - all " scenarios : @entity18 delegate allocation rule : extremely complicated version of proportional			1
each county holds multiple rounds of voting until one candidate receives more than 50 % of the vote in that county			0
winner of a county wins that county 's allotment of total delegates			1
if one candidate receives a majority of total delegates , he receives all 32 of the state 's delegates			2
winner - take - all scenario : each county is allotted a share of the state 's total number of national convention delegates			1
one candidate wins enough counties to amass more than 16 of the state 's 32 delegates and thus automatically receives all 32 delegates			2
state rules were designed to favor a winner - take - all outcome			2
@entity30 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			2
34 statewide delegates allocated in proportion to statewide vote , with a 20 % threshold ; 42 district delegates ( 14 districts with 3 delegates each ) winner - take - all by district if winner gets more than 50 % , otherwise modified proportional			0
winner - take - all scenario : if the winner keeps all opponents under 20 % of the statewide vote and wins all 14 districts with more than 50 % of the vote , then he wins all the state 's delegates			1
@entity97 leading comfortably in polling , but the question is whether he can hold @entity12 to below 20 % of the statewide vote , while also winning every district with a clear majority			0
@entity16 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			0
all 38 delegates allocated in proportion to the statewide vote , with a 15 % threshold			0
winner - take - all scenario : if only one candidate reaches the 15 % statewide vote threshold , then he wins all the state 's delegates			1
if @entity12 wins his home state with a big margin and keeps @entity97 , @entity116 or @entity117 under 15 % , then he wins all 38 delegates			1
former candidates @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and " no preference " are also on the ballot to further split the @entity125 vote			0
@entity32 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			0
15 statewide delegates winner - take - all if a candidate receives more than 50 % of statewide vote , otherwise proportional with 20 % threshold ; 48 district delegates ( 16 districts with 3 delegates each ) winner - take - all by district vote			1
@entity117 did not submit any delegate slates in three districts ( congressional districts 6 , 9 , and 13 ) , which means he can not win any delegates from these districts			0
in six additional districts ( cds 3 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 , and 16 ) , he submitted only partial delegate slates , which means that if @entity117 wins any of these districts , he will only receive one or two out of the three possible delegates in that district			0
winner - take - all scenario : if the winner gets more than 50 % of the statewide vote and wins every cd , then he gets all the state 's delegates			1
or if only one candidate receives more than 20 % of the vote and also wins every cd , he wins all the state 's delegates			2
if @entity117 wins statewide , he can not win every cd because he has n't fielded full delegate slates			0
if @entity12 wins , it 's unlikely he 'll win more than 50 % statewide and also unlikely that he would carry every cd			2
@entity33 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			0
25 statewide delegates winner - take - all if candidate receives more than 50 % of statewide vote , otherwise proportional with 15 % threshold ; 15 district delegates ( five districts with three delegates each ) winner - take - all by district vote if winner gets more than 50 % of district vote , otherwise proportional by @entity150 vote with modified 15 % threshold winner - take - all scenario : if the winner gets more than 50 % of the statewide vote and wins every cd by more than 50 % , then he gets all the state 's delegates			1
or if only one candidate receives more than15 % of the vote and also wins every cd by more than 50 % , he wins all the state 's delegates			2
likelihood : unlikely that one candidate will receive more than 50 % of the statewide vote and in every cd , according to polling			0
also unlikely that only one candidate would reach the 15 % threshold			0
@entity34 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			0
28 statewide delegates winner - take - all if winner receives more than 66 % of statewide vote , otherwise proportional with 20 % threshold ; 27 district delegates ( nine districts with three delegates each ) winner - take - all by district vote if winners receives more than 66 % of district vote , otherwise proportional with 20 % threshold			1
winner - take - all scenario : if winner gets more than 66 % of the statewide vote and wins every cd by more than 66 % , then he gets all the state 's delegates			1
or if only one candidate receives more than 20 % of the vote and also wins every cd by more than 66 % , he wins all the state 's delegates likelihood : very unlikely that one candidate will receive more than 66 % of the statewide vote and in every cd			2
also unlikely that only one candidate would reach threshold			0
@entity19 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			0
14 statewide delegates winner - take - all if winner receives more than 50 % of the statewide vote ; otherwise proportional with 20 % threshold ; three district delegates winner - take - all by statewide vote			1
winner - take - all scenario : if winner gets more than 50 % of the statewide vote , he gets all the state 's delegates			1
or if only one candidates makes the 20 % threshold , he wins all the state 's delegates			1
likelihood : very possible that @entity12 could win the statewide vote by more than 50 % and thus win all delegates			2
@entity20 delegate allocation rule : @entity77			0
13 statewide delegates winner - take - all if winner receives more than 50 % of statewide vote , otherwise proportional with 15 % threshold ; 33 district delegates ( 11 districts with three delegates each ) winner - take - all by district vote			1
winner - take - all scenario : if winner gets more than 50 % of the statewide vote and wins every cd , he gets all the states delegates			2
likelihood : very possible that @entity12 could win the statewide vote by more than 50 % and win every cd			0
he and @entity116 are the only candidates on the ballot			0
@entity0 's @entity236 contributed to this report			0

state party rules allow some chance of candidates shutting out opponents
@entity12 is most likely to benefit from complext allocation rules
@entity27 has shot at picking up all of @entity30 's 76 delegates
winner take all scenarios possible in other states but unlikely
