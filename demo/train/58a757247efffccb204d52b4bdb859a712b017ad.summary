-- the hacker group @entity1 has alarmed police in @entity3 this week after releasing sensitive information about officers			1
the group said they posted the information in response to @entity3 's controversial immigration law			1
" we are releasing hundreds of private intelligence bulletins , training manuals , personal email correspondence , names , phone numbers , addresses and passwords belonging to @entity3 law enforcement , " the group said in a statement			1
" we are targeting @entity19 ( @entity20 ) specifically because we are against @entity21 and the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is @entity3			0
" the @entity24 said the release of the documents is unsafe for officers			2
" law enforcement officials go to many lengths to protect their identities , " states @entity28 , president of the organization " these individuals maliciously released confidential information knowing the safety of @entity37 employees , and their families , would be compromised			1
" the controversial bill , @entity21 , passed last year but was quickly challenged in court by the @entity41			0
the measure would have required local police , while enforcing other laws , to question the immigration status of anyone they suspected of being undocumented			0
the @entity49 placed an injunction on parts of the measure in april saying that those parts overstepped @entity3 's authority			2
in its lawsuit , the @entity41 challenged only six of the @entity3 law 's provisions , meaning others went into effect in july			1
among the provisions given the go - ahead were a ban on " sanctuary cities , " or municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants			0
a provision making it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic and a provision dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants also went into effect			0
@entity0 's @entity80 and @entity81 contributed to this report			0

the group says they released the documents in response to @entity3 immigration law
