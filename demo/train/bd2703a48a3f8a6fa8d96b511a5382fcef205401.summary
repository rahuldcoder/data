-- @entity1 likes to camp			0
which is why the @entity4 fashion designer , who escapes her @entity6 workshop to rusticate in a tepee on her @entity9 country estate , was recently commissioned by one & only @entity10 to erect a similar structure on their beach in @entity14			1
" it 's escapism to the nth degree , " says designer @entity15 of the tents at the @entity17 , in @entity19 's @entity18			1
the 17 - foot - high tepee is decked out with beads , streaming ribbons , and embroidered patches -- a look @entity1 likens to " a jewelry box that glistens in the sand			1
" the resort offers cookouts by the tent -- marshmallows included -- served by a liveried butler			2
by any definition , this is an indulgent experience , but given its availability in a structure originally designed for the life nomadic , it signals a shift in our perception of both luxury and escapism			0
suddenly , a heightened sense of well - being may owe less to four sheltering walls than to a temporary shedding , not just of our inhibitions but also of all the weighty paraphernalia that clutters up a sedentary life			2
tents pitched in far - flung locales have always had romantic cachet -- who could forget @entity56 and @entity57 in " @entity58			2
" and now there 's a trend of textile pleasure domes being adapted for use in diverse settings across the globe			1
" they provide an experience that you could miss in an ordinary concrete box , " says designer @entity15 of the tents at the @entity17 , in @entity19 's @entity18			1
" guests can hear the sound of elephants munching their way through the jungle			0
it 's escapism to the nth degree			2
" @entity0 : see the world 's best tented camps that sentiment is evident in @entity15 's design for the resort			1
he drew inspiration from northern @entity19 's hill - tribe villages as well as camps he visited in @entity85 , and he filled the 15 tents with metal craftwork from local artisans , along with explorer - themed antiques ( an old compass , rifles , primitive fishing tools )			1
like @entity1 , @entity94 - based fashion designer @entity93 is also dabbling in the world of hotels , opening the tented @entity97 near @entity99 's @entity98 last year			1
she stitches tents of locally loomed cotton in the same workshop where she creates beaded tunics and accessories inspired by indigenous @entity99 designs			1
set on platforms above a river bend , the camp 's tents are furnished with tables and beds built with wood from dhow boats , and decorated with african - themed found objets d'art : crocodile skulls , elephant shoulder blades , beaded walking sticks and clubs			1
" for me , a tent should be the veil between you and @entity124 , a sheer shield to protect but not in any way disconnect you from her presence			0
to be under canvas on a comfortable bed , with the smell of acacia blossoms -- in the old safari days this was intoxicating enough , but now we have the ability to improve on the concept			0
" and that 's exactly what @entity138 is doing with one of its latest resorts , the @entity142 , on a coral atoll in the @entity144			2
created by @entity146 , one of the group 's head designers , it 's by far the most cosseting tented property available today			1
only 18 guests at a time can stay on the private island			0
rooms come in the form of three conjoined tents facing a cobalt - blue lagoon : a king - size platform bed dominates the air - conditioned sleeping tent , while the bathing pavilion has a claw - foot tub			1
a butler and massage therapist are at guests ' beck and call			0
spas , too , are employing tents to help travelers abandon worldly cares			0
in @entity173 's @entity172 , @entity171 guests take treatments in one of six new tents styled by @entity178 - born designer @entity177			1
" for me , a tent evokes impermanence , " she says			0
" it reflects the impermanence of the spa treatment as well			0
" set in a botanical garden shaded by paloverde trees , each of the tents has natural cleft - stone flooring , an acacia - wood bench , and walls made of saguaro and ocotillo cacti			2
tipping the indulgence scale , @entity195 ' @entity194 , in @entity196 , has put up two new spa suite tents patterned after a 16th - century @entity200 encampment			2
when @entity203 's royalty went camping , their tasseled tents were made of velvet and embroidered silk			0
devised by husband - and - wife hotel design team @entity207 and @entity209 , the billowing pavilions contain handwoven carpets , royal pennants , and love swings made from salvaged shesham wood			0
and if that 's not adequate escapism , this month @entity195 opens @entity216 , a safari lodge with 18 tented suites in the bamboo forests of @entity220 , a four - hour drive from @entity222			1
created by one of @entity203 's top architects , @entity223 , each tent has bamboo floors , solar - powered heated pools , and traditional artwork from nearby @entity229			2
definitely fit for a mogul on the move			0
