let 's call this @entity3 game balls for dummies			1
oh , do n't take offense			0
up until a few days ago , when the @entity8 " scandal " broke , we were all dummies when it came to the esoterica of @entity3 ball rules			1
hell , let 's be honest ; we were imbeciles			0
now , we 're learning all sorts of fancy things about the league 's regulations and how teams and referees handle footballs before and during a game			1
for instance , did you know the ball must be a " prolate spheroid " ? and did you know that before today , the term " prolate spheroid " had appeared on @entity0 only four times in its history ? perhaps that 's for the better			0
anyway , you 've got questions , and as so often is the case , we have answers			0
let 's get pumped up ! ( sorry , it 's tough for writers to resist a play on words , no matter how terrible			0
) what on @entity40 is going on ? the @entity3 is investigating the @entity41 to determine why 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for sunday 's afc championship game were under - inflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each			1
the @entity41 supplied their own balls ? is n't that letting the fox watch the hen house ? @entity50 , for lack of a more elaborate answer ... yes ? according to @entity3 regulations , each team provides a dozen balls to the referee for testing two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff			1
the home team also supplies 12 backup balls , and for outdoor games , the visiting team has the option of bringing another 12 balls			2
in addition , the ball manufacturer -- in this case , @entity67 ( cue " @entity69 " jokes ) -- ships eight more balls , in what the @entity3 scientifically terms " a special box , " directly to the referee			1
the box is opened two hours and 15 minutes before the game , and the referee marks each ball with a " k , " to designate it for kicking			0
@entity80 writer @entity79 pointed out the curiosity of the regulation in an appearance on " @entity84 " on wednesday			0
when @entity79 played college basketball , she said , the referees brought out @entity88 - supplied balls an hour before the game			1
those balls were used for warmups and the game , and they were not to leave the court , she said			2
if the @entity88 has such a rule for women 's basketball games , she posited , how can the ludicrously profitable @entity3 not provide its own game balls ? a fine question			1
who 's in charge of making sure balls are up to snuff ? " the referee shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications			2
a pump is to be furnished by the home club , and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game , " @entity3 rules state			1
the ball attendant transports the footballs to the field , and ball boys keep them on the sideline , @entity80 reports			2
ball boys are usually vetted by teams and paid by the @entity3 and can be sons or daughters of team employees , the network reports			1
so it was the ball boy ! yes , with a candlestick in the conservatory			0
if the @entity3 had pinpointed a culprit , @entity0 would n't need to devote writers to deciphering the league 's game - ball rules			1
what other rules pertain to a game ball ? as mentioned , it has to be a prolate spheroid , which in layman 's terms means " shaped like a football , " and it has to be signed by commissioner @entity142 -- as opposed to , say , @entity143 or " @entity144			0
it should have between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds of air per square inch and weigh 14 to 15 ounces			0
it should have a long axis of 11 to 11.25 inches , a long circumference of 28 to 28.5 inches and a short circumference of 21 to 21.25 inches			2
and , perhaps most importantly , it needs to be constructed of a urethane bladder encased in pebble - grained leather of " natural tan color			2
" so , no purple footballs			2
why would someone deflate the balls ? it supposedly makes them easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers			1
that would 've been especially important in the wet conditions in which the @entity165 was played			0
is it always an advantage ? eh , unclear			0
@entity169 quarterback @entity168 allegedly once told commentator and former quarterback @entity171 that he could get a better grip on an over-inflated ball			1
how was the issue even raised ? in the second half of sunday 's game , @entity176 linebacker @entity175 intercepted @entity41 quarterback @entity179			1
according to @entity180 , he took the ball to his team 's equipment staff , which then informed head coach @entity184 , who told general manager @entity185 , who told @entity3 director of football operations @entity186 , who told the officials on the field			1
this should remind you of that kindergarten game where you sat in a circle whispering things in your classmates ' ears to demonstrate how messages are lost as they 're conveyed from one person to the next			2
thus , it 's entirely possible @entity175 told the equipment staff he wanted to go for pizza after the game , and by the time it got to the officials we had @entity8			0
what about the wing official and umpire who spot the ball before each play ? would n't they have noticed ? hmm , you would think so			0
has this ever happened before ? there are lots of tales of ball manipulation surfacing in the wake of @entity8 , but one particular story stands out			0
in 2012 , the @entity219 , which kind of has this thing for cheating , was accused of under - inflating balls used in a game against the @entity224			1
the school was reprimanded and fined , and a student - manager was axed when he conceded that he had under - inflated the balls after the officials had approved them			1
the unnamed student said he did it all by his lonesome , and no other @entity219 coach , staff member or administrator had any knowledge of his shenanigans			0
could weather have played a role ? there have been numerous reports that cold weather can diminish ball pressure , which would normally be pertinent for the @entity244 area ... except that it was 51 degrees in @entity245 , @entity246 , at kickoff			0
is it possible @entity41 coach @entity249 knew ? outside of @entity246 , the general public puts @entity249 somewhere on par with @entity252 , so you 'll find no shortage of people who say , " oh , most definitely , " especially after @entity256			1
the coach says , however , " in my entire coaching career , i have never talked to any player ( or ) staff member about football air pressure			0
" what about @entity179 ? asked about it monday on a @entity244 radio show , the three - time @entity264 winner responded , " i do n't even respond to stuff like this			1
" he also responded by calling the accusation " ridiculous			0
" on thursday , he told reporters he did n't alter the balls and assured them , " i 've always played by the rules			2
" at least one football icon has his doubts that @entity275 's lesser half was not complicit			0
in one of the most damning non-accusations in history , @entity277 coach @entity276 told @entity281 he believed @entity249 was clueless about the ball pressure , but " i can see -- and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone -- but i can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy			1
" he also said , " that 's something that would n't be driven by a coach or just the equipment guy			0
nobody , not even the head coach , would do anything to the football unilaterally , such as adjust the amount of pressure in a ball , without the quarterback not knowing			2
it would have to be the quarterback 's idea			2
" what to make of that ? no idea , but they did name the greatest video game the world has ever known after the dude			0
has the rest of the team spoken up ? several @entity41 have called the controversy " stupid " and accused the media of fueling the controversy			1
( for what it 's worth , this writer is willing to bet his pinkies no journalist is responsible for deflating the balls			2
) do the @entity41 forfeit the win if they 're found guilty ? ridiculously unlikely ( sorry , @entity323 ) , but they could be fined and docked a draft pick			1
after @entity256 , the league took away a @entity41 ' first - round draft pick , fined the team $ 250,000 and fined @entity329 $ 500,000 , but do n't expect anything that serious in @entity331			1
could the ball pressure really have played that large a factor ? similarly unlikely			0
the @entity41 won 45 - 7 , and 28 of their points came in the second half -- after the game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure			1
then why is this such a big deal ? see earlier remark regarding @entity249 and @entity252			0
also , there 's this game coming up two sundays from now called the @entity264 ...			0

@entity3 investigating whether @entity41 under - inflated 11 footballs
under - inflating balls makes them easier to grip , unless you 're @entity168
@entity276 not - so - *subtly* implies quarterback @entity179 was in on it
