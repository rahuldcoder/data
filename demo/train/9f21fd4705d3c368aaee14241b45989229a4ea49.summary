@entity5 made seven changes ahead of friday 's @entity11 showdown with @entity12 , but the @entity14 champions should have still wrapped up the three points			1
@entity16 put @entity1 in front in the 33rd minute at the @entity18 , but paid the price for failing to add to their advantage when @entity7 substitute @entity22 leveled with four minutes remaining			1
it has left the @entity3 champions with 10 points from four games , a point clear of arch rivals @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , who all boast perfect records from three games			0
an unbeaten @entity3 run of 29 games , dating back to last season was also extended , but there was a worrying development for @entity5 when captain for the night , midfielder @entity40 , limped off with an ankle injury near the end			0
it had all looked so promising when @entity46 international @entity45 completed a superb run by crossing for @entity48 star @entity16 to open the scoring			0
@entity45 and @entity16 both had chances to double the advantage but @entity7 were rewarded for their endeavor when @entity53 crossed for @entity54 to beat @entity55 from close range			2
@entity1 laid siege to the home goal in the dying moments , but could not force the winner			2
" if you 're only 1 - 0 up in the @entity3 , things like this can always happen , " @entity5 told @entity1 's official website			1
" we have only ourselves to blame , " added regular skipper @entity65 , who came on as a second half substitute			0
meanwhile , @entity1 's @entity3 rivals @entity68 secured their passage to this season 's @entity71 group stages with a thrilling 3 - 2 win in @entity74 over @entity75			2
after a 1 - 1 draw in @entity78 last week , @entity68 's victory secured a 4 - 3 aggregate win , but they ended the match with 10 men after @entity82 was red carded just after the hour mark			1
the score stood at 1 - 1 at the time , but @entity68 pulled ahead for the second time when @entity86 scored in the 79th minute , a crucial second away goal			1
@entity89 leveled for the home side , but @entity93 , with his second of the match , sealed a famous victory			0
in their qualifying action , @entity95 wrapped up their place in the competition proper for the 17th straight time as two @entity101 goals saw them beat @entity102 2 - 0 at the @entity103			2
the @entity105 side had won the away leg in @entity107 3 - 0 but still fielded a strong side for the return leg , with @entity110 international @entity101 again outstanding			0
@entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 will also go into thursday 's draw .			0
