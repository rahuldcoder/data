' " @entity2 told @entity1 that while reality shows are not particularly a great way to become famous , " you still get attention ; you still get all those things that come along for the ride , which i think is what she was most interested in			1

" when @entity1 asked @entity2 the secret to his long career in television -- particularly the long - running " @entity8 " role -- the actor called it " a characteristic that can help you survive in television , which is a kind of affability and vulnerability			1
you allow yourself to be human			0
" when @entity1 pointed out that the " odd thing " about @entity2 is that so few @entity64 television stars openly admit to being @entity65 , @entity2 said , " i 'm a bit of a rebel			1
i do n't tend to warm too well to people that tell me how i 'm supposed to think			2
so , my life in @entity72 -- i 'm afraid i was destined to be a @entity65			1
" @entity2 added that his @entity72 friends " tolerate me somehow , because i can at least state myself eloquently			1

i think lower taxes are a good idea			0
" @entity2 does , however , fully support gay marriage , which many tea partiers oppose			2
" i guess i 'm more libertarian in that way , " @entity2 said			1

greed that is at a profound level			0
" @entity2 also stated that there is n't one @entity65 candidate that he 's gravitating toward just yet , telling the @entity0 host that @entity65 contenders " must inspire people to assume that they have a right to make their own decisions about what dreams they wish to dream			1
and dream as big as they possibly can			0
