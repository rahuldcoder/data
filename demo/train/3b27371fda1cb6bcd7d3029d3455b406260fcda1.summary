-- @entity1 has dominated the @entity2 recently , winning five of the last six editions including the dramatic 2012 competition in @entity6			1
it 's still early but the @entity1 women could be on the way to starting a streak of their own in the @entity12			1
they took a 3 - 1 lead against the @entity14 following the opening session of foursomes at the @entity17 on friday			1
besides making it back - to - back titles , a win in @entity19 , @entity20 , would give @entity1 a first ever victory on @entity14 soil			1
@entity26 pair @entity25 and @entity27 earned @entity1 's first point by upsetting @entity31 @entity30 champion @entity29 and @entity32 4 and 2 before @entity33 and @entity34 topped @entity35 and @entity36 2 and 1			1
while world no. 3 @entity33 is a veteran , @entity34 is one of six @entity12 rookies on the @entity1 team			1
she 's joined by 17 - year - old @entity40 , who became the youngest participant in @entity12 history when she later played in the fourball matches			1
" it 's the most pressure i ever felt because it 's not only for you , it 's for a team and it 's for something greater than yourself , " @entity34 , twice a winner on the @entity46 this year , was quoted as saying by the @entity46 's website			2
" so you have a little extra pressure to hit the shots			0
" the @entity14 got on the board when @entity12 standout @entity55 teamed with @entity56 -- the daughter of retired tennis grand - slam winner @entity58 -- to down @entity61 and @entity62 3 and 2			1
but the experienced pair of @entity64 and @entity65 fell to @entity66 and @entity67 2 and 1			2
" we 're all trying to take care of our own match and definitely getting off to a good start really helps , " @entity27 was quoted as saying by the @entity46 's website			2
@entity73 ' round began poorly and the world no. 2 behind @entity75 was visibly frustrated , dropping her club at one stage after an errant drive			0
@entity55 , though , improved to 8 - 2 - 2 in the @entity12 as she played alongside rookie @entity58			2
" we did n't make a lot of mistakes , " she told the @entity80			0
" we made a few but kept them to a minimum			0
hit a lot of fairways and greens and made a couple of putts			0
both of us made some pretty big par saves			0
" we 're good friends so it 's a lot of fun to play together			0
she 's got some fire in her belly , that 's for sure			0
