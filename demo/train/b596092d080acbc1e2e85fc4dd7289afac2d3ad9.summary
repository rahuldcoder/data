-- it 's a good bet that @entity2 and @entity3 wo n't be wearing singlets for this @entity5			1
but it 's also safe to assume that -- once again -- they 'd be plenty fast			0
these two @entity11 @entity10 stars got one step closer saturday to another @entity5 , this time in wintry @entity13			1
they are among the women named saturday as " push athletes " for the @entity11 ' six - women bobsled team , according to the @entity17			1
@entity3 acknowledged the honor with a quick , emphatic message on her @entity21 feed to those offering congratulations : " thank you ! " @entity24 quickly followed suit , while noting that saturday 's announcement means she 's part of the national team , but not necessarily off to @entity29 this coming winter			1
the @entity5 team will be named in january , though those on the national team certainly have a big leg up on the competition			1
the others in the same group as @entity24 and @entity3 include 2010 olympian @entity36 , two - time @entity37 medalist @entity37 , two - time national push champ @entity39 and @entity38			2
those piloting the @entity11 bobsleds are @entity42 -- who won a silver medal as last season 's @entity44 -- as well as @entity46 and @entity47			0
these are all accomplished athletes in their own right , though @entity24 and @entity3 are probably the most recognizable among the @entity11 public			1
@entity3 , 30 , emerged in 2002 as a @entity11 @entity51 then @entity52 in the 100 - meter dash , the same footrace in which she won the 2004 @entity57 crown while attending the @entity58			2
that same year , @entity3 made her @entity5 debut -- finishing second in the 100			2
the @entity62 resident finished first in the 2005 @entity63 100 meters , and was a two - time gold medalist ( in 2005 and 2007 ) in the @entity63 4x100 relay			0
she also made the @entity11 olympic team in 2008 after placing third in the trials			0
the photogenic @entity24 may be as recognizable for her commercials and photo shoots in some circles , though she 's been a fierce and accomplished track and field athlete in her own right			1
the @entity74 native is an 11 - time @entity75 from her days at @entity76 , where she won titles in both sprint relays and the hurdles			0
in 2008 , @entity24 appeared on top of the track world -- winning the 60 - meter hurdles in the @entity83 and being named the @entity84 for good deeds outside the sport			2
in fact , she entered that summer 's @entity5 in @entity89 as a gold medal favorite , only to trip on a hurdle and finish seventh			0
she suffered another setback in 2011 when she underwent spinal surgery , yet still managed to make the next year 's @entity5 team			0
this time , @entity24 did better but finished just out of the medals , in fourth .			0

@entity2 , @entity3 are both accomplished track and field athletes
each has competed in summer olympics as sprinters or hurdlers
they *'re* named to the @entity17 national bobsled team
that makes them a step closer to the @entity111 in @entity13
