" the @entity18 is a $ 50 million company helping multinationals to reach these million consumers ; through doing so they are pioneering @entity1 marketing solutions			1
@entity72 , co-founder and co-ceo of @entity74 , says : " @entity76 brands are coming from all over the world and they want in on @entity1 as is obvious , and agencies like ours are helping them engage a consumer in a new , inventive way , which is actually a very old traditional way			1
it 's one - on - one conversations			0
" and these conversations are taking place at every social event -- be it after church on a sunday , after a sports match , at ladies clubs , or at stokvels or shisa nyamas -- unique @entity1 social gatherings			2
zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in @entity1 on what to buy , and why they should buy it			1
this marketing strategy works in @entity1 because , as @entity105 , co-founder and co-ceo of @entity108 explains , @entity1 consumers " will use something a friend has recommended or a sister or a brother or a parent or any relative has recommended			1
" they 're quite wary and skeptical to try new things , " he adds			0
" you need to bear in mind one thing -- their disposable income is very , very low , so they ca n't take chances , they ca n't buy something and if it does n't work go and replace it with a competitor , they do n't have the means , so they 've got to be 100 % certain that the purchase that they make , they 're comfortable with and it will fulfill their needs			0

@entity56 is one of @entity108 's clients ; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach			1
@entity136 , group ceo for @entity56 explains : " in reaching your customers you need to reach them in different ways and one of the big things is that the traditional media does n't necessarily reach into the far more rural parts of a country ... so a lot of it has to be done through word of mouth and promotions			1
" what we do is we hire people that actually go out into the different townships , into the different rural areas and really promote the product			2
they walk the streets and communicate , so they go to taxi ranks and places where people gather and really spend a lot of time promoting the product			2
" @entity165 is a @entity56 promoter who spends a lot of time at a taxi rank in a township called @entity170 , north of @entity0			0
she says that this type of marketing is effective because it 's in a language that consumers understand			0

she says that her community members sometimes call her miss @entity56 , because she represents the brand			0
for the community , a big multinational such as @entity56 now has a face and a voice and can give one - on - one advice on a daily basis			0
" zonal champions are n't like normal promoters , they do n't usually have working hours ... when you live and breathe a brand and you 're passionate about it , you do it 24/7 , 365 , " says @entity72			1

unemployment in @entity1 remains a pressing issue , where more than 24 % of the citizens are unemployed			0
@entity206 - @entity205 says that they found a niche : " we found that there 's a whole lot of people uneducated and previously probably unemployable , so to speak , and we found a methodology of training and managing these people so we can actually give them a job as a zonal champion or a brand champion , as someone who can drive a message into their communities			1
" typically our trainings are a day , two days , three or four days at maximum and the guys walk in with absolutely no sales knowledge , no knowledge of what a brand is , no marketing knowledge and they walk out doing things like using body language techniques to sell products			0
" but it 's about more than selling products			0
it 's about developing trust that will ultimately lead to sales			0
@entity72 explains : " there 's a wonderful @entity241 idiom , it goes , ' @entity242 , ' which means one hand washes the other			0
that is the kind of communal perspective that @entity247 have , which brands that come from all over the world need to understand			0
" it means that if you 're a brand that needs to support me in the community , create employment opportunities , gives me real product information , i will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other			1
" if brands can tap into that and build that trust , then they 'll win the @entity1 continent over			2

" zonal champions " used by multinationals to promote brands through word of mouth
they are *locals* who are trusted by their communities to recommend the right product
this form of advertising gives employment opportunities to *unskilled* people
