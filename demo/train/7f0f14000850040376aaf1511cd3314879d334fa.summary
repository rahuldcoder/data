@entity0 , @entity1 -- flying over the island of @entity0 in @entity1 , i looked out the window and got my first exciting glimpse of the @entity8 rainforest			1
it was vast , lush and green , but it was n't all rainforest			1
there were squares of farmland and large patches of trees in neat rows that i knew were palm oil or pulp and paper plantations			1
from above , the patches of green seemed to flow in and out of the rainforest , but i knew those patches of rainforest were shrinking			1
i turned around and saw that the other members of our @entity2 crew on the plane with me -- correspondent @entity25 , tech expert @entity25 and @entity30 based cameraman @entity31 -- were all looking out the windows , too			1
after all the preparation and the travel delays , we had finally made it			1
we knew this was going to be a trip unlike any other			1
our first destination was at a very remote camp in @entity40 near 30 @entity41			2
i knew how remote it was going to be , so it was n't a surprise when we traded our caravan of pickup trucks for three giant off - road vehicles			2
we knew since we were here during the rainy season , these vehicles were the only way to get up these extremely muddy mountain trails			2
read more : @entity52 on why you should care about @entity0 i did n't know just how treacherous these trails would be until the driver of our off - road truck stopped and told us that we would have to cross the bridges on foot			1
if a bridge broke or the truck slid off , we did n't want to be inside			2
it was dark , and the @entity2 @entity63 crew did n't have our gear because our luggage was lost in transit			1
i was the only one with hiking boots and @entity25 was the only one with a flashlight			2
we eased out of the trucks into slippery , squishy mud and walked slowly toward the bridge trying to avoid deep puddles			2
these bridges were a test of our balance and nerve			0
each bridge was two sets of heavy logs lashed together , one set of logs for the left tires and one set for the right			0
we looked down and estimated it to be a 6 meter drop			0
we slowly and carefully walked across one side , one at a time , tightrope style			0
@entity31 and @entity25 even did it carrying their cameras			0
amazingly , no one slipped			0
even more amazingly , the trucks all made it across with no problem			0
i was still very glad to see the camp lights come into view			0
we had finally arrived at the @entity100 camp			0
this group is doing some amazing work to help replenish a critically endangered @entity8 orangutan population			1
their goal is to take captive @entity8 orangutans that were pets and teach them how to live in the wild so they can be released into the rainforest			0
orangutans were extinct in this area of @entity0 before the @entity112 came here			1
now , more than 140 live in this patch of rainforest			0
once the generator powered down for the night , i lay in my bed and listened to the sounds of the rainforest just outside			0
soon it started to rain and the sounds of the rain mixed with the sounds of the rainforest were incredible			0
i will never forget the sound of the @entity8 rainforest surrounding me , and the feeling of knowing the next day i would see a captive orangutan released back into the wild .			1
