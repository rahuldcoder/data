@entity0 -- forget political pedigree , executive experience or ties to deep - pocketed donors			0
no @entity7 presidential candidate is better positioned to capitalize on the recent tide of conservative anger toward president @entity10 than @entity11			1
her charisma and crossover appeal to both social and fiscal conservatives have the three - term @entity16 congresswoman rising in the polls and primed to make a serious impact on the @entity7 nomination fight			2
@entity11 , unlike several of her rivals making appeals to the @entity24 movement , has the resources and fundraising potential to steer her campaign beyond the crucial early states of @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
though firmly on the insurgent side of the @entity7 field , she is also taking steps to position herself as a credible alternative to the crop of establishment - friendly @entity38 contenders with deep pockets and long political resumes			0
she has hired @entity42 's debate coach			1
she nabbed @entity44 's pollster			1
and @entity11 's campaign organization will be based not in @entity16 , but in @entity0 , where the coming battle on @entity47 over raising the debt ceiling will place her squarely in the middle of the national political debate this summer			1
most her rivals , now out of office , will be watching from the sidelines			0
the question of whether @entity11 can ride these advantages all the way to the @entity7 nomination will begin to be answered on monday in @entity29 , where she formally launches her presidential bid in @entity59			1
that @entity11 was born in @entity59 and lived there until age 12 is fortuitous			1
@entity29 , political observers say , is now key to @entity11 's chances of becoming president			1
" the bad news for @entity11 is that she has to win @entity29 , " said @entity7 strategist @entity64 , who is not aligned with any 2012 campaign			1
" without it her campaign is over			0
the good news for @entity11 is that she can win @entity29			2
" that much is true			0
a @entity70 poll released over the weekend confirmed what many @entity29 @entity7 have been proclaiming for months : that barring a late entry into the race by a high - profile conservative like @entity42 or @entity77 gov. @entity76 , @entity11 might be the @entity29 frontrunner			1
@entity11 captured the support of 22 % of likely caucus - goers in the survey , putting her just one percentage point behind former @entity83 gov. @entity82 , the @entity7 frontrunner who does not plan to compete as seriously in @entity29 as he did during the 2008 race			2
no other candidate came close to that level of support , including @entity77 rep. @entity88 , former sen. @entity89 , businessman @entity90 or former house speaker @entity91 -- all candidates who , like @entity11 , are angling for support among @entity24 activists and social conservatives			1
strikingly , former @entity16 gov. @entity96 , who has campaigned in @entity29 for more than a year but has struggled to gain traction , took just 6 %			0
with her showing in the @entity70 poll and an eye - opening performance in the @entity30 @entity7 presidential debate earlier this month , the expectations for @entity11 in @entity29 are climbing			1
with little more than seven months until the caucuses , her staff must work to keep them in check			2
" the expectations are rising for her , " said @entity107 , one of @entity11 's closest advisers			1
" she has to meet or beat expectations , whatever those are next february			0
" while @entity11 's team smartly refuses to call @entity29 a " must - win , " they acknowledge that a strong showing in the caucuses is crucial for her campaign			1
" the primary process is sort of like the @entity120 tournament , " @entity107 said			0
" you have to survive and advance			0
that 's what you have to do in these early states in order to do well			0
that 's a long way of saying @entity29 is pretty important for her			0
" @entity11 has yet to do the kind of face - to - face campaigning that @entity130 demand , though that will quickly change as the campaign gets underway			2
meanwhile , her staff has been busy laying the groundwork for a competitive race			0
her congressional chief of staff , @entity135 , re-located to @entity70 in early june			0
@entity29 state sen. @entity136 , a popular figure among @entity29 @entity24 activists , will chair her campaign			0
@entity140 , the political director behind @entity142 's surprising second place finish in the 2007 @entity143 , is taking on a similar role for @entity11 ahead of this year 's poll , scheduled for august 13			1
out of the view of the media , there is also behind - the - scenes work underway to win over the kind of hard - to - reach grassroots activists who often play an outsized role in the caucuses			0
@entity11 , for instance , has lined up the backing of influential home - school activist @entity156 , a board member of the @entity157 who assisted @entity142 's winning caucus effort in 2008 and helped the conservative effort to oust three judges from the @entity162 last year			1
in private meetings in recent months , @entity11 has won over influential faith leaders across the state , including @entity166 , the pastor of @entity167 in @entity168			2
@entity166 runs a group called " @entity170 for biblical values , " a loose network of pastors from around the state			0
he recalled meeting with @entity89 , @entity88 and @entity96 early in the presidential process , but said that @entity11 was the only @entity7 who spoke convincingly about " the moral issues " that faith - minded voters in @entity29 hold dear			1
" @entity11 is what she claims to be , " said @entity166 , who manages an e-mail database of politically active churchgoers			2
" she will bring the conservative and @entity184 perspectives back to where they need to be			0
she will find a lot of support among religious conservatives in the state as things move forward			0
i think she has it already			0
" the challenge for @entity11 's staff if they hope to win more than just @entity29 is to broaden her appeal beyond just the conservative activists who seem to have gravitated to her early			1
@entity11 must defend a thin record during three terms in the @entity0 , where she is known more for her frequent cable news appearances than for any significant legislative achievement aside from creating the @entity203			2
and , as aides to her @entity7 rivals like to point out , her tendency toward gaffes and conspiratorial claims about the president would be problematic , if not fatal , in a general election			0
@entity11 seems to be aware of this fact , which is why she has assembled a team of veteran political operatives to manage her campaign			2
she hired @entity215 , who directed @entity217 's landslide re-election bid in 1984 and managed @entity142 's 2008 effort , to run her operation			1
along with loyal advisers like @entity221 and fundraising consultant @entity222 , @entity11 has brought on top flight @entity7 talent like pollster @entity225 , who was working with @entity226 gov. @entity44 before he declined to seek the nomination , and former @entity228 and @entity231 message maven @entity229 , who coached @entity42 before her high - stakes vice presidential debate in 2008			1
also aiding @entity11 : veteran consultant @entity233 , who has deep ties to the conservative movement , former @entity231 campaign web guru @entity236 , and @entity238 , a fundraiser for president @entity228 's 2004 campaign and former @entity243 mayor @entity242 's 2008 bid			1
when asked " why @entity11 ? , " a common theme emerges in discussions with her advisers , some of whom might have been comfortable working for a more traditional candidate like @entity96 or @entity82			2
their argument , as simple as it sounds , is that @entity11 is the only candidate in the field who truly understands the issues and impulses of the @entity7 voter at a very unconventional moment in @entity258 politics			2
" after the first debate performance it was obvious that people responded to her in such an overwhelming way , " said @entity259 , her @entity261 - based media consultant			0
" there was a sense that finally someone was speaking to the heart and the core of the party			0

@entity11 is scheduled to launch her presidential bid formally on monday
she has hired @entity42 's debate coach , nabbed @entity44 's pollster
@entity11 's staff challenge is to broaden her appeal beyond conservative activists
