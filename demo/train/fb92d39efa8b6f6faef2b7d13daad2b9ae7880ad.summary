-- @entity4 , the influential , @entity5 - winning author of " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " has died , his family and officials said			1
the literary giant was treated in april for infections and dehydration at a @entity12 hospital			0
@entity4 , a native of @entity13 , is widely credited with helping to popularize " magical realism , " a genre " in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination , " as the @entity16 committee described it upon awarding him the prize for literature in 1982			1
he was sometimes called the most significant spanish - language author since @entity25 , the 16th - century author of " @entity26 " and one of the great writers in @entity30 literature			1
indeed , @entity32 poet @entity31 told @entity33 that " @entity6 " was " the greatest revelation in the @entity36 language since the @entity26 of @entity25			0
" the author 's cousin , @entity39 , and @entity13 's ambassador to @entity12 , @entity40 , confirmed the author 's death to @entity0 on thursday			1
" we 're left with the memories and the admiration to all @entity13 and also @entity12 because i think @entity4 was half @entity12 and half @entity13			1
he 's just as admired in @entity12 as he is in ( his native ) @entity13 , all of @entity49 and throughout the world , " @entity40 told @entity0 en @entity36			1
share your memories with @entity0 's @entity53 " i believe they were somehow emotionally ready for this regrettable outcome			2
they knew he was suffering from a complex , terminal disease and was an elderly man			0
i believe ( @entity4 's widow @entity60 ) was getting ready for this moment , although nobody can really prepare themselves for a moment like this			1
" in a televised speech thursday night , @entity13 president @entity65 declared three days of national mourning , ordering flags to be lowered to half - staff across the country			1
the author -- known by his nickname " @entity4 " throughout @entity49 -- was born in the northern @entity13 town of @entity74 , which became the inspiration for @entity76 , the town at the center of " @entity78 , " his 1967 masterpiece , and referenced in such works as his novella " @entity83 " and the novel " in @entity84			1
" " i feel @entity49 from whatever country , but i have never renounced the nostalgia of my homeland : @entity74 , to which i returned one day and discovered that between reality and nostalgia was the raw material for my work , " reads a mural quoting the author outside of town			2
@entity4 was tickled that he had earned so much praise for his fertile imagination			1
" the truth is that there 's not a single line in all my work that does not have a basis in reality			2
the problem is that @entity107 reality resembles the wildest imagination , " he told the @entity104 in 1981			0
a storyteller 's childhood @entity4 's early life was shaped by both familial and political conflict			1
his grandfather , a widely respected figure known as the @entity116 , was a liberal military man who strongly disagreed with the political views of @entity4 's father , a conservative telegraph operator who became a pharmacist			1
( his father 's ardent pursuit of his mother later inspired " @entity7			2
" ) their political disagreement came to reflect that of @entity13 as a whole , a country that spent a postwar decade in the grip of what was called " @entity133 , " a civil war that followed the assassination of a populist leader			1
@entity4 spent his early childhood with his grandparents while his parents pursued a living in the coastal city of @entity142			1
both his grandparents were excellent storytellers , and @entity4 soaked in their tales			1
from his grandfather he learned of military men , @entity13 history and the terrible burden of killing ; from his grandmother came folk tales , superstitions and ghosts among the living			1
his grandmother 's stories were delivered " as if they were the irrefutable truth , " according to the @entity4 site themodernword.com			1
the influence is obvious in @entity4 's works , particularly " @entity6			1
" in 1936 the @entity116 died and @entity4 returned to his parents and their growing family			1
he was eventually one of 11 children , not to mention several half - siblings from his father 's affairs , a familial sprawl that also found its way into his books			2
after finishing high school , @entity4 went off to college with dreams of becoming a writer			2
his parents , on the other hand , had plans for him to become a lawyer			0
writing ended up taking precedence : when @entity133 broke out , @entity4 started contributing stories to a local newspaper and eventually became a columnist			2
he had also been exposed to writers such as @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and especially @entity186 , who had turned his own patch of land in @entity189 , @entity190 , into the shape - shifting past and present of @entity192			2
in the mid- 1950s , @entity4 left @entity13 for @entity193 , a move partly provoked by a story he 'd written that was critical of the government			1
the distance , he later said , helped shape his perspective on @entity49 politics			0
for years , @entity4 had been writing and publishing fiction , including short stories in @entity49 journals and a handful of longer works , including " @entity83 , " which was published in 1955			2
but it was n't until 1967 with the publication of " @entity6 " that he broke through to a wide audience			0
' 100 years ' of literary renown the novel is set in @entity76 , a town founded by the patriarch of the @entity6 family , @entity6			0
over the generations , members of the family are set upon by ghosts and visions , fall in love , dream of riches and fight in wars			0
natural events take on supernatural aspects -- rains that last years , plagues that create memory loss			0
it is a tapestry of almost biblical proportions in which reality and spirit swirl and merge , a world unto itself -- as well as a commentary on the politics and history of the world at large			0
" the narrative is a magician 's trick in which memory and prophecy , illusion and reality are mixed and often made to look the same			0
it is , in short , very much like @entity4 's astonishing novel , " wrote the @entity243 in a 1970 review upon the release of the @entity247 translation by @entity248			1
@entity4 worked on " @entity78 " tirelessly , selling off family items , living on credit , smoking up a nicotine frenzy			2
upon its release , the book became an instant bestseller in @entity49 and was equally successful in @entity247			0
it has been estimated to have sold in excess of 20 million copies -- some sources say as many as 50 million -- in two dozen languages			0
the book did n't ease all of @entity4 's problems , however			1
as a vocal leftist and defender of @entity266 's @entity265 , he was regularly limited or denied visas by the @entity268 until president @entity269 , a fan of " @entity78 , " revoked the ban			2
@entity269 commented on @entity4 's death thursday			1
" i was saddened to learn of the passing of @entity4 , " he said in a statement			2
" from the time i read ' @entity6 ' more than 40 years ago , i was always amazed by his unique gifts of imagination , clarity of thought , and emotional honesty			0
he captured the pain and joy of our common humanity in settings both real and magical			0
" @entity4 was also involved in a feud with onetime friend writer @entity288 , a @entity289 and a @entity16 laureate , who punched the @entity13 in the face in 1976 -- believed to be over politics but later revealed to be over @entity288 's wife			1
@entity4 's ensuing works were generally praised			1
they included " @entity296 " ( 1975 ) , " @entity297 " ( 1981 ) and " @entity298 " ( 1990 )			0
he is said to be the most popular @entity36 - language author in the world			2
" @entity7 , " with an @entity247 translation published in 1988 , was a particular bestseller			0
the love story , which was turned into a 2007 movie , was referenced in such works as the 2001 movie " @entity310 " and the finale of the tv series " @entity309			0
" @entity4 's style and impact have been widespread			1
he is credited with spearheading " @entity317 , " attracting attention to a generation of @entity49 writers , including @entity288 and @entity12 's @entity316			2
magical realism is now an accepted genre , to the point that some critics believe it has been overused			1
and he prompted a focus on @entity49 politics -- protesting the 1973 @entity325 - aided coup in @entity32 , calling attention to corruption and free speech issues in @entity329 and around the world			0
he never gave up journalism			0
" i 've always been convinced that my true profession is that of a journalist			0
what i did n't like about journalism before were the working conditions , " he told the @entity104			0
" now , after having worked as a novelist , and having achieved financial independence as a novelist , i can really choose the themes that interest me and correspond to my ideas			0
" he was one of the most honored -- and highly respected -- authors on @entity343 , particularly in parts of the world where literature is taken as seriously as politics			1
" on behalf of @entity12 , i would like to express my sorrow for the passing of one of the greatest writers of our time , @entity4 , " tweeted @entity12 president @entity348			1
@entity13 's president summed up the author 's presence on @entity358			1
" @entity359 never die , " @entity65 tweeted			0
for all of his immortality , however , @entity4 preferred the here and now			2
asked about the impact of dreams on his dreamlike writing , he said he 'd rather focus on reality			0
" life itself is the greatest source of inspiration , " he said			0
" i see dreams as part of life in general , but reality is much richer			0
" but maybe , " he added , " i just have very poor dreams			0
" people we 've lost in 2014 @entity0 's @entity377 and @entity0 en @entity36 's @entity378 and @entity379 contributed to this story .			0
