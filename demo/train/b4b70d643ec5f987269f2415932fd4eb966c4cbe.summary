@entity0 : how did you start making recycled fashion ? @entity19 : my mother owned a gallery and directed a college of art , and i spent my whole life in art classes			1
in college , i got a degree in art and sociology			2
one year , my art school got a new pop machine			2
the garbage can next to it grew with all the pop cans			1
seeing them thrown out just seemed wrong			0
i put a recycling bin next to the pop machine			0
i started wondering : where does trash go ? who picks it up ? after that , my career path was in solid waste and recycling			0
5 - star restaurant recycles your meals and other green food stories as the recycling coordinator for @entity26 , to promote a weekend - long exhibit of recycled art , i threw together a little outfit made of bubble wrap			0
each year , i made another dress , getting more and more intricate			1
now , i ca n't imagine using anything but trash			0

@entity0 : besides the landfill , where does your art come from -- the vision ? @entity19 : honestly , it feels like divine intervention			1
artistically , i have a sense of confidence that does n't really line up with the rest of myself			0
i do n't know why i can say to @entity18 or @entity132 , " send me your waste and i will create something i know you will love			1
" all i can say is that my art comes from a spiritual , creative relationship that is so interesting to me			0
@entity0 : do you have a favorite piece ? @entity19 : that 's like picking a favorite child			1

i researched the super-heroine @entity162 , created in the 1940s -- the same era this type of suit was worn by @entity18 stewardesses -- by a psychologist to provide a strong role model for young girls			0
in addition to her invisible plane and bulletproof bracelet , @entity162 was given a lasso of truth that made men be honest			0
this garment is about being a role model who is strong and stands up for the environment			0
the safety cards are scenes of people preparing for a crash			0
the cards ask , " what if ? " that sort of emergency is happening around the world with the environment , because of our decisions			0
my art is about what we can do in our lives to live lighter on the @entity196 , and to prepare ourselves			0
like the safety cards , the message is about conservation and preparation			0
@entity0 : what details are less obvious ? @entity19 : the cape looks windblown because of the wire armature holding it up , made from yard signs from the @entity206 campaign			1
@entity0 : how much do you charge for a commission , and who pays ? @entity19 : about $ 10,000			1

@entity0 : is your tetanus shot current ? @entity19 : it should be , but i do n't think it is			1
@entity0 : what size are your dresses ? @entity19 : for a while , i made all my pieces about a size 12 , because honestly , i was the only available model			1
