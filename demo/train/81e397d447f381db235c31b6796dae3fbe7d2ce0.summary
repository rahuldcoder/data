-- one of the more intriguing pop controversies of 2013 was the friendly fire exchanged over the perceived similarities between @entity5 's " @entity4 " and @entity7 ' " @entity6			1
" this sunday 's @entity8 just might bring some resolution to that argument — or at least declare a " winner " : both tracks are nominated for best pop solo performance , alongside @entity15 ' " @entity16 , " @entity17 's " mirrors , " and @entity19 's " @entity18			1
" if sunday represents an end to the controversy , that will suit @entity7 just fine			1
" i was surprised and to be honest disappointed at how vicious people were , " @entity7 tells @entity0			1
" it 's not my nature , and it 's not reflective of what i feel i hope to incite in people			2
people really felt like @entity5 was ripping me off , and i disagree			2
" @entity7 was most frustrated by the fact that she was apparently supposed to be rivals with @entity30			1
" @entity5 and i have known each other a really long time , she 's a friend of mine , and it seemed like there was this infusion of people wanting to create conflict and drama			2
i find that to be really fatiguing , " she said			0
" it 's an old paradigm of pitting people against each other based on the idea that there 's not enough — not enough fans , not enough music lovers , not enough space for both of you , so you have to hate each other			1
i do n't believe in that			0
i feel it was misguided			0
there 's better s — to do than worry about that stuff			0
" like , for example , whether or not she should be preparing notes for a possible pair of victory speeches ( she 's also up for @entity58 )			2
" i have n't written anything down , " she admitted			0
" i would want [ an acceptance speech ] to be authentic , so if it happened i would want to speak from my heart			0
but i do worry about being so nervous			0
" find out whether @entity7 wins ( and gets nervous ) this sunday at the @entity63 ( 8pm on @entity64 ) , which you can follow in all its bombastic glory here on the @entity70 see the original story at @entity0			1
