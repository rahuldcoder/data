-- @entity1 sat just behind sen. @entity2 , nodding her head and listening as he pressed the case with @entity6 state senators to restore felon voting rights			1
" kids do make mistakes			2
@entity20 kids make mistakes , " @entity2 told the @entity15 committee considering a constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of some felons on wednesday			1
" but when you look at the prison population , three out of the four people in prison are black or brown			2
" @entity1 whispered : " good for you			0
i 'm glad someone is speaking up			0
" she felt as if he was narrating her life			0
in 1991 , the former @entity32 basketball team captain received a 10 - year sentence for crack cocaine possession			0
since her release , she has been unable to vote			0
" i remember when my mom showed me how to vote for the very first time			0
i remember watching the movies of my ancestors getting mauled by dogs and water hoses , " @entity1 said , her voice cracking a bit			0
" it changed my life completely			0
i was an embarrassment to my family			0
" " i 'm not making any excuses for my behavior			0
should i have gotten a 10 - year sentence ? yes , i should have			0
have i served my time ? yes , i have			0
" @entity52 calls for restoring ex-cons ' voting rights the issue of restoring felon voting rights has made for some unusual alliances as former felons , like @entity1 , see in lawmakers like @entity2 , a tea party - backed @entity60 , a champion			1
nationally , about 5.8 million people are prohibited from voting because of current or previous felony convictions , according to attorney gen. @entity52			2
in the swing states of @entity68 and @entity69 , one in five black adults is unable to vote because of these laws , according to @entity52			1
in @entity2 's home state of @entity6 , it 's also one in five			1
" somewhere along the line he gained a lot of knowledge , " @entity1 said of @entity2 's push to restore voting rights to nonviolent felons			1
" he has seen the disenfranchisement , " said @entity1 , a community organizer with @entity81 for the @entity82 , a nonprofit grassroots organization that has pushed to restore the voting rights of felons			1
one place where he notices that is west @entity90 's predominantly @entity89 neighborhoods , a community where @entity2 sticks out at the grassroots gatherings he 's attended			1
the potential 2016 presidential candidate has spent quite a bit of time over the past year in that area and at the @entity97 listening to black men vent frustration over not being able to vote after completing their prison terms for nonviolent crimes			2
@entity2 said he started thinking that this is exactly the type of issue that could help build a bridge between the @entity60 and @entity89 - @entity89 voters			1
" it 's an important issue			2
when you look at who is being deprived of voting they are disproportionately people of color , " @entity2 told the state @entity15 panel			1
it is a lesson he says was brought home for him in real terms while hanging out in west @entity90			0
" in the last six months or so , i 've been over to the @entity120 in the west side of @entity90 and i met a lot of people there who are very smart , very bright , very articulate who told me they ca n't vote because ( because they are felons ) , " @entity2 said in a phone interview before the hearing			1
" i 've become aware of the problem ... not just in regard to voting but also in terms of getting work			2
" @entity2 's push to change laws he says disenfranchise black menâ € ” a longtime crusade of many civil rights organizations and minority lawmakersâ € ” echoes the slow evolution of the @entity60 following huge losses among @entity89 voters during the 2012 presidential election			1
tough racial issues face @entity60 in minority outreach an internal autopsy of sorts conducted last year by the @entity145 revealed a wide gap between the party and @entity89 voters			2
the @entity60 moved to try and fix the rift by beefing up outreach			0
" we 've been improving our messaging because we need to , " said @entity150 , the @entity145 communications director for black media and a former @entity2 staffer			1
" but we need to speak to how our messaging ( improves the lives ) of all @entity156			0
" as the @entity145 was working on its messaging problem , potential presidential contenders such as @entity2 also began tentatively reaching out to minority voters			1
@entity2 's speeches at historically black colleges @entity161 in @entity162 and @entity163 in @entity90 , among others have been met with mixed reviews			1
he was roiled for what some saw as a condescending tone in his questioning whether @entity161 students knew that the @entity171 founders were @entity60			0
but he also received kudos for just showing up			0
last year , he was the first major @entity60 to speak at @entity161 since @entity173 in 1994			0
efforts like @entity2 's illustrate the delicate dance the @entity60 must undertake if it is to appeal to minority voters in a way that is sincere , said @entity178 , an associate professor of political science at @entity180			1
" if the policies are wrong and are n't framed in a way that is appealing to minorities they are going to be a hard sell to minorities , " she said			2
@entity2 may have just struck the right chord			2
during his lunch last week with @entity52 , @entity2 said he talked about their shared concerns about laws that disenfranchise black men , including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes			1
@entity2 's also crafting a federal measure that would restore voting rights for felons who committed nonviolent crimes			1
" we have to convince people we do care , " @entity2 said during a phone interview of the @entity60 's outreach to minorities			1
" we do care about what is going on in areas of long - term poverty and long - term crime			0
" currently , 11 states restrict or completely deny voting rights to prisoners even after they 've completed sentences , probation and parole			1
in @entity68 , for example , roughly 10 % of the population is banned from voting as a result of these laws			1
" there 's a racial outcome in who 's incarcerated in our country , " @entity2 told the state senators			2
" not only is the incarceration unfair but they get out and their voting rights are impaired			1
" as for @entity1 , who got a chance to meet @entity2 and take a picture with him , she points out that her son registered as a @entity60 by accident when he voted for the first time			2
she 's encouraged him to keep the party affiliation			0
" i told him it did n't matter , " she said			0
" as long as he voted			0
" a more diverse slate of @entity60 presidential possibles @entity0 's @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
