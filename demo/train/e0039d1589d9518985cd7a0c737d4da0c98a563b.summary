-- in most of the country , employers can force pregnant workers out of the workplace when their pregnancy interferes with their normal job duties			2
@entity7 , a retail sales associate , lost her job because consuming water while working , an activity necessary to maintain a healthy pregnancy , violated store policy			0
@entity13 , a nursing home activity director , lost her job because her pregnancy interfered with her ability to lift heavy tables			0
her employer terminated her employment even though lifting tables " took up a small part , roughly five to 10 minutes " of her day and her co-workers volunteered to perform this task			0
workers covered by the @entity25 , by contrast , can continue working despite their physical limitations			1
the @entity28 with @entity29 of 2008 broadened the @entity25 to include many short - term and relatively minor physical conditions			1
pregnant women who experience comparable physical limitations should also have the opportunity to receive accommodations that will enable them to continue working			1
according to @entity37 regulations issued in 2011 , the amended @entity25 requires employers to accommodate persons who experience " shortness of breath and fatigue when walking distances that most people could walk without experiencing such effects			1
" it also requires employers to accommodate persons with back injuries resulting in a " 20 - pound lifting restriction that lasts or is expected to last for several months			2
" in some circumstances , even a far more common 50 - pound lifting restriction may qualify an individual for @entity25 coverage			1
to date , courts have balked at including pregnancy within the @entity25			1
they 've reasoned the physical limitations accompanying pregnancy are too short - term and minor to qualify as disabilities			1
the courts ' remaining objection to providing @entity25 accommodations to pregnant workers is pregnancy is " the natural consequence of a properly functioning reproductive system " and therefore can not be a disability			1
the @entity68 provides no protection to the approximately 40 % of @entity28 workers who fall outside its scope			0
even for workers covered by the act , it does little to enable women to continue working during their pregnancies			0
when a pregnant worker is unable to perform her usual job duties , her employer may force her to take unpaid leave under the act even when temporary job modifications would enable her to continue working			0
if the employer requires her to take leave before the 28th week of pregnancy , the worker will lose her @entity68 - guaranteed right to reinstatement because she will exhaust her 12 weeks of @entity68 leave before the baby arrives			2
unlike pregnant workers , @entity25 - eligible employees can continue earning a paycheck whenever they are able to do their job with reasonable accommodations			1
and if @entity25 - eligible workers also enjoy @entity68 coverage , they can save their fmla leave for situations when their medical condition truly necessitates time off			1
the courts ' objections misunderstand the @entity28 with @entity101			0
the @entity25 significantly differs from earlier disability laws that viewed persons with disabilities as defective			2
the @entity25 recognizes much of the disadvantage associated with disability is more environmental than biological			2
for example , historical decisions to solely provide building access by stairs reflect the historical assumption wheelchair users would not , and should not , participate in public life			0
had wheelchair users historically been considered full citizens , employers and architects would not have so frequently designed buildings that exclude them			0
properly understood , the @entity25 's mandate to reimagine our social environment to accommodate historically excluded persons should encompass pregnancy			1
like more traditional " disabilities , " the interaction between pregnancy and many work environments constricts women 's employment opportunities			2
it also reflects the historical workforce marginalization of childbearing women			0
if @entity28 culture is to value pregnant women as legitimate wage earners , work polices should accommodate pregnancy 's physical effects			1
accommodation rights for pregnant workers need to catch up to accommodation rights for persons with disabilities			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			0
