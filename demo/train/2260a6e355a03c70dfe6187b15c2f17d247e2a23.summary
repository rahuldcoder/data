-- republicans and @entity2 have entered into an impeachment frenzy over the past few weeks			2
the impeachment wars began when a small group of @entity6 started to make noise about the possibility of impeaching president @entity9			1
the most high profile of the bunch was former @entity13 governor and vice presidential candidate @entity14			0
in her characteristic way of getting right to the partisan point , @entity14 published an article on @entity18 in which she said , without specifying the exact grounds for her argument beyond her sense of a " lawless " president , that , " it 's time to impeach			1
" @entity14 was not alone			0
several @entity6 in @entity24 had mentioned the possibility of impeachment in the spring , including @entity28 rep. @entity27 and @entity30 rep. @entity29			1
on the sunday morning talk shows , majority whip @entity31 refused to rule it out			0
some observers believe that , even though he has denied the @entity6 will pursue this option , speaker of the house @entity36 has fueled the fires by filing a lawsuit against the president over his use of executive power			1
@entity2 have responded by using the threat of impeachment as a fundraising tool			1
they have blasted out a series of e-mails to supporters asking for money , warning that if @entity2 do n't do well in the midterm elections in november , the next two years will bring a revival of the late - 1990s when @entity37 @entity6 voted to impeach president @entity52			1
in one of the messages from the @entity57 , the " @entity54 " warning said the speaker 's lawsuit " has opened the door to impeachment , " according to the @entity62 , and that the @entity63 confirmed @entity36 refused to " say impeachment is off the table			2
" indeed , @entity62 adviser @entity66 said he would " not discount the possibility " of impeachment while the @entity62 press secretary agreed there were some @entity6 " who are running for office , hoping that they can get into office so that they can impeach the president			1
" the parties are playing games with impeachment , an unfortunate and dangerous development			2
the impeachment process is meant to be a tool of last resort , a constitutional mechanism through which @entity24 has the capacity to remove a president who has engaged in criminal behavior , committing " treason , bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors			1
" when it is simply not possible to wait until the next presidential election to resolve the question of whether someone who has committed serious offenses should be in the @entity62 , this is the only tool @entity24 has at its disposal			0
forty years ago , @entity24 turned to impeachment when confronted with a president , @entity99 , who brazenly used executive power to obstruct an investigation into wrongdoing within his administration surrounding the break - in at the @entity57 headquarters at the @entity107 complex			1
@entity24 never reached the point of voting to impeach him , though they would have , only because @entity99 resigned 40 year ago this week			2
at other times " impeachment " has been much more of a political tool			2
often impeachment has been a threat used by opponents of a public figure			0
starting in 1961 , conservative activists famously carried signs calling for the impeachment of @entity122 chief justice @entity121 , whose court made landmark progressive rulings on issues like school segregation and the rights of crime suspects			2
" @entity129 : impeach @entity121 , " their banners said			0
during @entity132 , " @entity135 " attempted to impeach @entity6 president @entity133 for having violated the @entity134			1
the real reason behind their drive to impeach was a frustration with @entity133 's failure to enforce the @entity141 and disagreements with him over how to handle race relations in the @entity145 period			0
most famously , and most relevant to many republicans who are terrified about their colleagues carrying this too far , the heated partisan climate of the 1990s culminated with the @entity150 voting to impeach president @entity52 for lying under oath about the facts in a case involving his affair with @entity62 intern @entity155			1
the @entity156 pulled the @entity24 back from the brink of convicting @entity52 and removing him from office			0
as @entity36 and other republicans remember , the impeachment backfired on the @entity6 as @entity52 's approval ratings skyrocketed and theirs plummeted			1
during @entity163 's presidency , some @entity2 called for impeachment based on allegations he had misused executive authority and tricked the public into a war based on the false premise of @entity171 having weapons of mass destruction			2
the current use of impeachment as a political tool comes at a time when all parts of the legislative process seem subject to politicization			1
nothing seems to be off limits			0
in 2011 , the nation witnessed how the decision to raise the debt ceiling , the routine process through which @entity24 agreed to pay for spending that they authorized , became a volatile political weapon used to extract compromises over spending cuts with the draconian threat of sending the nation , and the world , into economic chaos if @entity9 did not comply			1
now we are seeing the same with impeachment , though still in the earliest of stages			0
but it is important for the leaders of both parties to push back and resist the temptation of reliving the 1990s and using this mechanism as yet another tool in the partisan wars			1
fortunately , the nation has not needed to use the impeachment tool very often			2
generally mechanisms such as congressional oversight and @entity212 prosecutors have been sufficient to contain presidential misbehavior			0
that does n't satisfy the harshest @entity6 critics of president @entity9			1
they claim he has misused executive power in making adjustments in the implementation of the @entity220 , such as delaying the employer mandate			0
some also say he has failed to enforce immigration control legislation			0
ironically , though @entity6 stood by president @entity163 when he deployed executive power on matters of national security and domestic policy , they now claim that president @entity9 is circumventing @entity24 in excessive fashion			1
the complaints about growing executive power are clearly worthy of debate			0
indeed , both parties , who seem to love presidential power when they have it but hate it the rest of the time , should engage in a serious discussion about what has happened to the balance of power in recent decades			0
but thus far what the @entity6 have alleged against president @entity9 does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense			1
yet as @entity99 reminds us , it is not impossible to imagine a situation where the nation will need the impeachment process again			2
in 1986 and 1987 , the @entity248 raised the impeachment question when it became clear that high - level national security advisers had consciously violated congressional prohibitions on providing aid to the @entity255 rebels			0
president @entity256 ultimately was not impeached because there was no " smoking gun " showing @entity256 knew the violations were happening			0
yet the tool could have become essential			0
impeachment will lose its legitimacy within the public if it becomes a totally politicized process			2
while it is foolish to imagine that it is possible to ever contain the forces of partisanship , there need to be some limits and political leaders need to draw some lines in the sand			0
as we remember the events that resulted in @entity99 having to step down , the anniversary should be a powerful and important reminder to our nation 's leaders to keep their hands off the impeachment tool so that @entity24 can turn to it only in a true case of emergency			1
join us on @entity286 / @entity285 .			0

@entity6 raise prospect of impeachment and dems use it for fundraising
@entity293 : both parties are using a serious process as a partisan tool
he says there 's no serious case to be made against president @entity9 for impeachment
@entity293 : 40 years ago , the @entity303 saw how the @entity107 case made impeachment very relevant
