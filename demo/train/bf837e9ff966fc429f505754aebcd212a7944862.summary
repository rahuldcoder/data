@entity1 's police scanner pops to life with chatter just before midnight			2
moments later , " @entity9 , " as he 's known , is rushing to the scene of a robbery near the @entity7 campus alongside fellow veteran photojournalist @entity8			1
by the time they arrive , the 20 - year - old robbery victim has been taken to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the back			2
@entity9 snatches two cameras from the back seat of his car and jumps into the street			2
he is roving around the crime tape like a caged lion , snapping photographs as police take away two men in handcuffs			1
standing nearby , @entity8 thumbs away at his smartphone , updating @entity28 : " on shooting scene at 17 & @entity30 in @entity31 now			1
" @entity9 and @entity8 co-founded @entity32 to help curb gun violence plaguing what is supposed to be the @entity35			1
" i want to put the audience out there in the streets , " @entity9 said			2
" i want them to see what i 'm seeing every night in this city : the children watching crime scene investigations night after night , day after day			1

a rate approaching the level set in 2007 , when the city saw more than a murder a day and earned its nickname @entity64			1
at @entity49 , an open - source interactive journalism project launched in march , the goal is to avoid becoming entangled in gun control debates or in drafting new legislation , @entity8 said			1

we 've done this before , and we can do it again			2
it 's not going to go on forever			2
and the harder we work the sooner we 'll put an end to this violence			1
" until 2008 @entity8 was a senior photographer and photo - columnist at the @entity88 , where he worked since 1991			2
the @entity90 - winning photojournalist , who now teaches journalism , got the idea for the project after viewing a documentary called " @entity96 " during a trauma journalism conference			2

" this is a people problem , not a government problem , " said @entity161 , a @entity163 education professor who works with educators and youth to prevent school fights , shootings and cyberbullying			0
" i see so much hopelessness and despair			0
a broken child comes from a broken home , with few exceptions			0
" @entity31 successfully attacked the gun crisis in the late 1990s because law enforcement , residents and religious leaders worked together , @entity161 said , adding that once the body count went down people went back to their lives			1
" we have n't reached a critical point ( again ) when the communities and stakeholders have decided that this a major issue that needs to be addressed , " he said			0
" instead of whining , we need to put a call out to every caring adult to spend one hour a week with a child in need			0
it 's all hands on deck			0
" out of the nation 's 10 largest cities , @entity31 -- population 1.5 million -- has the worst homicide rate , with around 20 killings per 100,000 people , according to the @entity213 's @entity212			1
@entity214 on the list are @entity99 and @entity216			0

" it 's costing all of us			0
whether it 's immediately in front of your face or it 's several miles away in another community			0
we are all connected , and it 's affecting all of us , " @entity9 said			0

" if 200 whales washed up on the shores of @entity287 , every scientist and biologist would come to find out why this was happening			2

" it 's a new normal , and it 's not acceptable			0
