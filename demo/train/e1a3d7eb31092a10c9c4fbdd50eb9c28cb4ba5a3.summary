-- as a tech reporter , it 's my job to catch trends as they 're developing — to be ahead of the curve			1
i like to think i do a pretty good job , but i will forever have one hilarious black mark on my resume			0
" i am already kind of over @entity10 , " i wrote on april 5 , 2007			2
@entity10 was a new service back then , and i had signed up early enough to get a pretty cool username			2
frankly , i did n't think much of it since it seemed like a mild update to the @entity17 status messages i 'd already been using to communicate with my friends for years			0
boy , was i ever wrong			0
@entity10 has grown from being an insider back channel for tech nerds into being the insider back channel for the entire world			1
it is everywhere at once and everything to everyone : a public broadcast platform , a private messaging service , a way to share photos , a late - night therapy session , a journalist 's best friend			0
we expect people to be their most honest on @entity10 — and that honesty can spark firestorms of controversy			2
opinion : @entity42 -- take responsibility for your reckless claims television executives say that @entity10 has brought live tv back to life after years of wilting in the face of the @entity50 — we 're " social watching " now , which means we all want to tweet about shows as they 're happening			1
celebrities use @entity10 to talk to their fans without media and publicists in the way — and their platforms can be so valuable that they can earn thousands of dollars per tweet			1
every journalist i know says @entity10 has redefined the way news is gathered and shared — stories break on @entity10 now , not on tv or in the newspaper			1
i have a friend whose cell phone is set up to get a text whenever @entity71 tweets			0
i worry about her , but not as much as she worries about @entity71			0
since @entity10 is where the people are , that 's where the politicians and world leaders have gone			1
the pope just signed up for a personal account , and his first tweet is coming on december 12			0
senators and representatives of both parties have long made use of @entity10 to talk to their constituents on an unfiltered platform — sometimes with disastrous results , as @entity88 found out when he accidentally posted a private message publicly			2
president @entity90 took to @entity10 during the campaign season and again on monday to rally support for his fiscal policies			2
@entity90 's use of social media during the campaign highlighted his significant tech advantage over @entity98			2
but the president seemed to mostly use @entity10 to acknowledge that he knows @entity10 exists ; he said very little of substance in his eight tweets during monday 's " town hall			1
" we 'll know @entity10 has truly come of age as a political medium when our presidents use it to disseminate substance , not just show off that they 're in the know			2
interesting dramas regularly unfold on @entity10			0
last year the terrorist group @entity108 gained notoriety for setting up a @entity10 account			0
more recently , the @entity10 accounts of @entity112 and @entity113 began a war of words as the two sides began fighting each other on the ground			0
human tragedy turned into theater on the @entity121			0
the episode drew scrutiny from @entity124 , with seven @entity126 members of the @entity127 calling on the @entity128 to shut down @entity113 ' @entity10 account			0
" allowing foreign terrorist organizations like @entity113 to operate on @entity10 is enabling the enemy , " said rep. @entity130 , @entity131			0
he continued , " the @entity128 and @entity10 must recognize sooner rather than later that social media is a tool for the terrorists			0
" actually , @entity124 ca n't tell @entity10 what to do under the @entity138 , but the company will face increasing scrutiny as its user base grows — and for the level of control it can exert over free speech in a private platform			1
@entity10 faces numerous other challenges as well in the years ahead			1
the company might be a central part of @entity121 conversation , but it still has to figure out how to make money			1
those struggles have led @entity10 to exercise more and more control over its service as it tries to slowly transition from being just a platform to being a media company — control that 's angered a developer and user community that literally made @entity10 what it is today			1
the @ - reply , the hashtag , even the now - ubiquitous pull - to - refresh gesture : all these came from members of the @entity10 community , and @entity10 risks missing out on similar innovations as it imposes its own vision of the @entity10 experience			0
tech : will @entity10 war become the new norm ? and make no mistake , the backlash against @entity10 is real			1
spurned developers and early @entity10 adopters angry at @entity10 's new policies have turned to the alternative service @entity178 , which promises to hold true to @entity10 's own early ideals			2
the catch ? in order to make money , @entity178 charges a subscription fee , a guarantee that it will never be as vibrant and free - wheeling as @entity10			1
that sense of anarchy and openness and chaos is what makes @entity10 important — what makes it the town square and a freshman dorm room and an international conference call all at once			1
the challenge for all of us is figuring out how to best turn such a tool into more than just noise — and the challenge for @entity10 is figuring out how to make money without chilling the vibrant expression that makes it so vital			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 : @entity10 used to be for tech nerds , now it 's for the entire world
@entity203 : tv executives , celebrities , politicians , journalists all see @entity10 as *invaluable*
he says @entity10 faces challenges ahead , like free speech and how to make money
@entity203 : sense of anarchy and openness and chaos is what makes @entity10 vital
