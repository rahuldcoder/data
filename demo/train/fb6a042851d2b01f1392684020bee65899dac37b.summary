-- as a young art graduate , @entity1 went to @entity3 intending to spend six months traveling			1
more than two decades later , she is still there and has become one of the country 's most successful artists			1
@entity1 , who is based in @entity8 , has exhibited her contemporary work -- from paintings to sculptures -- all around the world			1
much of her work is based around bindis , the forehead decorations worn by @entity17 women			1
" the bindis now for me have become a material , " she said			2
" i took the material , i repeated it again and again and again			0
i can use them like an alchemist would use or to create something that i do n't really know what 's going to happen with			2
" @entity1 was born in @entity25 to @entity3 parents and grew up in a middle - class suburb , only visiting her parents ' homeland once , aged four			1
she went to art school -- a rarity in her @entity32 -- graduating in 1992			0
" all my cousins , friends , the people that we knew growing up as @entity36 are all doctors , accountants , lawyers , " said @entity1			1
" this is what @entity17 children did			0
if you were first generation in the @entity43 , you had to be a professional			0
" i think people were very surprised when we said we 're going to art school			0
i did and so did my sister			0
" @entity1 wanted to travel when she graduated and said she chose between @entity49 and @entity8 with a toss of a coin			1
" i had no intention of staying in @entity3 , " she said			1
" i just thought i 'm going to travel around the country			0
" after turning up at @entity8 railway station , @entity1 then discovered she was too afraid to travel the country alone			1
" i was so very flabbergasted when i first came to @entity3 , " she said			1
" my eyes were wide open , but it was like i was blind			0
culturally , it was a massive shock for me			0
i did n't speak @entity59 very well at all			0
" after two weeks in @entity3 , @entity1 met her husband -- @entity61 , now also a well - known artist -- and never left			1
the couple now have two children , @entity65 and @entity66			0
" that 's how we fell in love			2
i 've been here since , " said @entity1			1
she added : " the first 10 or 15 years were really were very hard like any practicing artist now			0
to decide to be an artist takes a lot of courage because there are years of rejection and a lot of loneliness			0
" to be able to believe in your work when nobody 's even looking at it takes real stubbornness			2
because we had each other , really would support each other			0
" as two well - known artists living together , @entity1 said she and @entity61 often compete with each other			1
" we do compete , ( healthily or unhealthily ) sometimes , " she said			0
" i think the crux of our relationship is art because this is something we are both extremely passionate about			0
" @entity1 said her career began to take off in 2006 when she made a model of an elephant			2
" people started to look and say ' it 's grand			2
it 's on a scale , ' and i think formally it was very successful			2
" it was really the first time people were asking ' who is this person ? who is this artist ? where is she from ? when did you make the work ? ' " in 2007 , @entity1 had her first solo exhibition at a major international gallery , @entity110 in @entity49			1
" i had suddenly got into my mojo , " she said			0
in the past year , she has had solo exhibitions in @entity25 , @entity49 , @entity113 and @entity8			2
when @entity1 began to work in @entity3 , she said there was virtually no art scene , and that even now it 's only just beginning to take off			1
" @entity3 still has n't been ( unpacked ) yet , and i think it 's about to begin now , " she said			1
" there 's a lot of really interesting work here and a lot of really good artists in @entity3			1
i just hope within our lifetime people realize that culture is really an important part of society			0
" @entity1 hopes she continue to contribute to that culture for many years to come			2
" when people go away from my work , i want them to go away with questions			2
why did the artist make this ? what is it about ? is there contradiction ? " i think almost every single piece that i 've ever made carries a degree of contradiction between the form and what it 's saying , between beauty and terror or the macabre			0
" @entity1 's solo show , " bind the dream state to your waking life , " will be at @entity147 , @entity8 , until february 16 .			1

@entity1 was raised in @entity152 , but has become one of @entity3 's leading artists
she traveled to @entity8 on the toss of a coin , but has stayed ever since
much of her work uses bindis , the forehead decoration worn by @entity3 women
