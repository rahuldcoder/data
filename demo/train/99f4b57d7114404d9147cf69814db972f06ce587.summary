days after a very public termination from the current tv network , controversial on - air personality @entity0 admitted he " screwed up , " in an appearance on " the @entity5 with @entity6 " tuesday evening			1
" i screwed up really big on this , " the former " countdown " host conceded			0
" it 's my fault that it did n't succeed , in the sense that i did n't think the whole thing through			0
" however , the transient host 's admission of guilt was not without a backhanded analogy			0
" if you buy a $ 10 million chandelier , you should have a house to put it in , " @entity0 said			2
" just walking around with a $ 10 million chandelier is n't going to do anybody a lot of good " -- a comparison that invited @entity6 to quip , " you 're the chandelier ? " @entity6 also presented @entity0 with an adjustable business card that could switch out @entity0 's various former employers			1
current tv 's co-founders , including former vice president @entity31 , announced march 30 that the network was ousting its highest - profile on - air personality , @entity0			1
" @entity40 was ... founded on the values of respect , openness , collegiality and loyalty to our viewers , " @entity31 and @entity35 wrote in an " open letter " to viewers on the network 's website			1
" unfortunately these values are no longer reflected in our relationship with @entity0 , and we have ended it			1
" @entity0 responded sharply in a series of @entity54 messages on the day of his dismissal , saying that for more than a year he had been " imploring " @entity31 and @entity57 " to resolve our issues internally			2
" he did not specify what those issues were			0
" nevertheless , mr. @entity31 and mr. @entity35 , instead of abiding by their promises and obligations and investing in a quality news program , finally thought it was more economical to try to get out of my contract , " the left - wing news personality wrote			1
" it goes almost without saying that the claims against me in @entity40 's statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions i will be filing against them presently , " @entity0 added , vowing later that the " truth of the ethics " of @entity31 and @entity57 eventually " will come out			1
" besides its statement , @entity40 offered no further comment			2
this marks the second time in 15 months that @entity0 has abruptly left a news network			1
in january 2011 , he cut ties with @entity80 after eight years			0
in that time , the former sports news anchor became a favorite of progressives for challenging rivals at @entity85 and elsewhere			0

the 53 - year - old was suspended from @entity80 for two days after the news website @entity92 revealed he had made donations to three @entity94			0
weeks after leaving @entity80 , @entity0 inked a deal with @entity40 , a company founded by @entity31 and @entity57			2
besides hosting and producing his new prime - time nightly news and commentary show , @entity0 was named @entity40 's chief news officer and had an equity stake in the company			1
he relaunched his signature " countdown " show in june , showcasing a host of liberal - leaning guests and the return of his " special comment " segment			0
in his @entity54 statement friday , @entity0 said his decision to join @entity40 was " sincere and well intentioned ... on my part , but in retrospect a foolish one			2
" " that lack of judgment is mine and mine alone , and i apologize again for it , " he wrote			0
his immediate replacement in the network 's 8 p.m. slot will be former @entity120 gov. @entity119 , @entity31 and @entity57 announced			1

he joins a network -- whose current president , @entity130 , was @entity122 's former @entity131 bureau chief -- that is available via cable or satellite tv in 60 million @entity136 households and in an additional 11 million internationally , according to @entity40 's website			1
