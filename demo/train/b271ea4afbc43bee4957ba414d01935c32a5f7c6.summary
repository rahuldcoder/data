-- her @entity3 home destroyed by a natural disaster , @entity1 stops to think about fire and water			1
she is thinking about the wildfire that reduced her house near @entity9 to ashes this week and about the water that @entity10 pushed into her childhood home eight years ago			1
" i sit back and reflect on the difference between flood and fire , " @entity13 said			1
the 16,000 - acre @entity17 in @entity3 claimed two lives and 500 structures			1
comparing what she witnessed at her parents ' home in @entity24 when it was flooded by @entity10 and the fire that engulfed her own home , @entity13 knows which is worse			1
with the flood , her family was able to salvage many items , even if they were waterlogged			1
" it was total destruction this time , " she said of her @entity3 home			1
we were told by the fire chief that the intensity of the heat made my three - story house collapse			1
" @entity13 , a psychotherapist , was at work on monday when her daughter , who happened to be in town , alerted her to the fire			2
@entity13 got to her house in time to see the plumes of smoke and to receive the reverse - 911 call to evacuate			2
she gave herself 30 minutes to get out			0
she and her daughter started with the electronics -- the computers and tablets that hold important records			0
then the physical documents in her possession			0
they started grabbing clothes from the closets , not really paying attention to whether the items would actually be helpful			0
" emotions override any logic at that point , " she said			0
@entity13 has two cats but could find only one			0
she had no way to transport the two horses she owns			0
the horses survived , but every day @entity13 remembers another special item that disappeared in the fire			2
she thinks : if she had just spent a few more minutes at her home , she could have saved some more treasured possessions			1
but , she has heard , the two victims who perished had waited too long to evacuate , possibly trying to save those memorable items			0
thinking back to @entity10 , @entity13 recalls the look in her parents ' eyes when they returned to their flooded home to see their losses			1
there were six inches of sludge on the floor , and the family entered with boots and gloves , looking at what survived			2
they found her father 's @entity101 medals			0
and a china doll that had fallen from its case to the ground but had not broken			0
the story of the doll , which they named @entity10 , was even featured in the @entity109			1
the doll still holds water that seeped in during the time it was submerged			2
after this week 's fire , though , there was nothing left of her house			1
just a foundation and ashes			0
" we walked around the house in amazement and horrified at what we saw , " she said			0
beyond reflecting on the destructive powers of water and fire , however , @entity13 is unwavering on her next step			2

@entity1 lost her family home in @entity10 , and her own home in a wildfire this week
fire is the worse of the two , @entity3 woman says : " it was total destruction this time . "
she lost her possessions but has no *regrets* about evacuating when she did
