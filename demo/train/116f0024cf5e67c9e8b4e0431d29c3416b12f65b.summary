@entity0 -- the @entity4 government is in the final stages of negotiations to bring a hotly disputed set of small islands in the @entity9 under public ownership , prime minister @entity2 said friday , stressing his country 's claims of sovereignty			1
the islands are at the heart of a bitter diplomatic argument between @entity4 and @entity17 that has resulted in occasionally violent acts of public protest			1
the uninhabited islands , known in @entity4 as @entity21 and in @entity17 as @entity21 , are privately owned by a @entity4 family			1
a public initiative begun in april by the outspoken governor of @entity0 , @entity25 , to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities has set off a new cycle of tensions between @entity4 and @entity17 over which country has sovereignty over them			1
@entity17 talks tough in @entity4 island dispute reports in the @entity4 news media this week suggested the @entity4 authorities had agreed a 2.05 - billion - yen ( $ 26.1 - million ) deal to buy the islands from the private owners			1
in an interview with @entity1 on friday , @entity2 declined to discuss the size of the sum likely to be paid for the islands , which are also claimed by @entity45 , because of the sensitivity of the matter			2
but he said the talks were in their " final stages , " and he remained unequivocal about which country the islands belong to			0
" the @entity21 are an inherent part of @entity4 territory , historically as well as under international law , so there 's no territorial claim issue between the two countries , " he said			2
" right now , it is the ownership issue -- whether the individual owns these islands , or the @entity0 metropolitan government or the state			2
and i think we have to clearly and solidly explain these stances to the @entity17 side			2
" his comments are unlikely to please @entity67 , which issued the latest of its angry statements on the matter on wednesday			0
" i want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the @entity4 regarding the @entity21 are illegal and invalid , " said @entity71 , a @entity72 spokesman			0
" we are closely monitoring the developments and will take necessary measures to defend our territorial sovereignty , " @entity71 said			0
why @entity77 is arguing over its islands @entity2 said friday that the purpose of the government 's planned acquisition " is to maintain those islands in a peaceful and stable manner			1
" the @entity72 did n't immediately respond friday to a request for comment on the matter			0
the islands , located between @entity45 and @entity88 , sit among popular fishing waters and are also believed to be rich in oil resources			0
animosity between @entity17 and @entity4 over the islands runs deep			1
they have come to represent what many @entity17 people see as unfinished business : redressing the impact of the @entity4 occupation of large swathes of eastern @entity17 during the 1930s and 1940s			1
@entity17 says its claim extends back hundreds of years			0
@entity4 says they saw no trace of @entity17 control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as @entity4 sovereign territory in 1895			1
@entity4 then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers			2
the @entity4 surrender at the end of @entity113 in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further			0
the islands were administered by the @entity117 occupation force after the war			0
but in 1972 , @entity119 returned them to @entity4 as part of its withdrawal from @entity88			0
in the interview friday , @entity2 also addressed recent difficulties @entity4 's relationship with another of its neighbors : @entity129			1
@entity0 dispatches team to survey islands at center of tensions he insisted on @entity4 sovereignty over a small group of islands in the @entity138 that @entity129 calls @entity139 and that @entity4 claims as @entity139			1
@entity129 president @entity140 visited the islands last month , prompting @entity4 to recall its ambassador to @entity143 and warn that it will take the issue to the @entity145 -- a proposal rejected by @entity143			1
@entity2 said he hoped @entity143 " will deal with this issue based on the principles of law and justice , but if they will not jointly refer this matter to the @entity145 , we will have to make preparations to do it unilaterally			2
" @entity4 has long claimed the islets as its territory , but @entity143 said all @entity129 territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by @entity4 in 1945			1
@entity140 also said in remarks to teachers last month that @entity4 emperor @entity164 should make a " sincere apology " for the suffering @entity129 people endured under @entity4 colonial rule , suggesting it was necessary before the emperor could visit @entity129			1
" first of all , we never requested a visit by our emperor to @entity129 , " @entity2 said			2
he added that @entity0 was requesting " a withdrawal of that statement as well as an apology			0
" he said he was " surprised " that the relationship with @entity140 had changed so dramatically in such a short space of time			0
" it is quite regrettable , " he said , before adding that a healthy relationship between the two countries is important for peace and stability in the region , especially with regard to issues like @entity185			0
territorial tensions rumble on as @entity187 visits @entity67 @entity1 's @entity188 reported from @entity0 , and @entity189 from @entity190			0
@entity1 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed reporting from @entity67 .			0
