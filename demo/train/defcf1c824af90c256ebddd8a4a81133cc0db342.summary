of all the things to say about @entity2 , the truest may be this : he made people smile			1
they might be those who packed comedy cubs for his frenetic , improvisational , hilarious routines			2
or those who fell in love with him as the lovable alien @entity12 and stayed in love through fun films such as " @entity15 " and serious ones such as " @entity16			1
" or those who had the pleasure of knowing him as a man -- a kind , decent , generous soul who made others ' lives better			2
throughout his 63 years , @entity2 rarely failed to impress others with his charisma , his talent , his heart			1
all the while , he fought his personal demons -- including substance abuse that led to at least two rehab stints , the most recent coming last summer			2
ultimately , those struggles led to his end			2
according to police , @entity2 apparently hanged himself with a belt this week in a bedroom of his @entity39 , @entity40 , home			1
someone who 'd given so much to so many over the years , in ways big and small , decided to take his own life after struggling with depression			2
officials : @entity2 apparently hanged himself still , while @entity2 never denied his struggles , he was never defined by them either			1
just ask those who rubbed elbows with him , whether they were big - time comedians or fathers he could give joy to their ailing children			2
invariably , they had a story that involved him laughing , telling stories and making people feel good			2
" his impact on the world was so positive , " tweeted comedian and occasional co-star @entity59			2
" he did so much good for people			2
he made and so many people laugh so hard for a very long time			2
" ' a comedy force of nature ' the son of a model and an auto company executive , @entity2 was born in @entity68 on july 21 , 1951 , yet spent most of his childhood in and around @entity70			1
@entity71 and sometimes bullied , @entity2 laid low growing up -- the latter being expected in his family , @entity2 told people in a 2009 interview , even if it 's opposite of the bigger - than - life persona he 'd cultivate through his career			1
" the ideal child was seen , not heard , " he said then			2
in an interview with the @entity81 , @entity2 characterized himself as " the opposite of a class clown " while at @entity85 , a private boys school			1
he worked hard , played soccer and wrestled and " just went out of my way to fit in			0
" " i loved school , maybe too much really			0
i was summa cum laude in high school , " he told the @entity81			0
" i was driven that way			0
" as a teen , @entity2 moved to @entity40 's @entity39 -- attending high school and college there before enrolling at @entity96 's prestigious @entity95 for performing arts			1
he 'd later return to the @entity98 , handing out @entity100 candy and boosting local causes			0
the once shy boy also found his place and his voice on stage at comedy clubs			0
even after making a name for himself in @entity109 , he kept coming back to do stand - up at establishments such as @entity113 's , @entity114 , the @entity115 and @entity116 because , as he told people : " it was my only release			2
" " to see @entity2 perform was an experience , " fellow comedian @entity118 recalled in a piece on @entity120			1
" he was more than a comedian			0
he was a comedy force of nature			0
" @entity12 from @entity12 the comedy clubs may have been where @entity2 felt at home			1
but he made it into millions of @entity129 ' homes in his role as @entity12 from @entity12			1
just as there 's never been anyone else like @entity2 , there 's been no other character like @entity12 -- an alien who took an egg - shaped spaceship to @entity138 and , thanks to @entity2 , ended up stealing many @entity141 ' hearts			1
the character debuted on the sit - com " @entity146 , " whose star @entity147 " realized i was in the presence of greatness " during @entity2 ' first rehearsal			1
from the start , his delivery , myriad faces and improvisational talents made him hard to resist			0
" i just realized my only job is to keep a straight face , " said @entity147 , who played " the @entity155			0
" " and it was impossible			0
because no matter what you said to him , no matter what line you gave to him , he took it in , processed it , and then it flew out of his mouth , never the same way twice			0
and it was incredibly funny every time			0
" the " @entity146 " appearance was such a hit that @entity166 created " @entity12 and @entity167 , " pairing him with his human roommate played by @entity170 and fellow alien ( and real - life idol ) @entity174			1
the show 's run ended four years later in 1982 , during which time @entity2 also starred as the titular character in the movie , " @entity180			1
" @entity2 did n't rest on his laurels			1
in fact , the beloved comedian turned his career on its heels by turning to dramas , starting with " @entity187			0
" instead of tickling people 's funny bones , he tugged at their heartstrings			2
and as he had done at comedy clubs , @entity2 excelled in roles in films such as " @entity194 " and " @entity195			1
" seesawing between comedy and drama @entity2 went back and forth over the decades to come , from family - friendly fare such as " @entity204 " and as the voice of the genie in " @entity15 " to more adult - themed movies such as " @entity202 " and " the @entity203			1
" what turned out to be biggest role yet was actually a small film led by two then unknown actors , @entity209 and @entity210 , in " @entity16			1
" playing sage psychologist and community college professor @entity213 , @entity2 won the @entity214 -- after losing out three other times -- for supporting actor			1
as he stepped on stage to accept the award , he said , " this might be the one time i 'm speechless " -- before launching an emotional , humble , joke - laden speech thanking all those involved in the film and his life			0
" and most of all , i want to thank my father , up there			0
the man who , when i said i wanted to be an actor , he said , ' wonderful , just have a back - up profession like welding			0
' " as the years rolled by , @entity2 did n't slow down			1
he seesawed in his roles -- from dark pieces such as " @entity234 " and " @entity235 , " to the lighter likes of " @entity237 " and the " @entity239 " movies			0
he even went back to tv on the short - lived @entity166 comedy , " @entity242			0
" the admitted workaholic at one point turned out eight movies over a two - year period			0
he told @entity247 in 2010 that he 'd " take it slow ... and enjoy the ride " after his 2009 heart surgery , though that does n't seem the case : four more films -- " @entity239 : @entity254 , " " @entity253 , " " boulevard " and " @entity255 " -- are expected to be released posthumously			2
" you have this idea that you 'd better keep working , otherwise people will forget , " he said			0
a funny man and humanitarian yet , as hard as he worked , @entity2 was never just about his work			1
for all the admiration of his talents , other actors remembering @entity2 tended to talk first about his huge heart , as the type of person who made you feel special , made you feel loved and made you laugh			1
and then there is his considerable charity work : @entity272 , a website that compiles the charitable work of celebrities , notes that @entity2 offered his time , money and celebrity to over 50 causes			1
@entity2 ' charity legacy that humanitarian work ranges from hosting @entity282 , biking in a fundraiser for good friend @entity285 's cancer support charity @entity286 , to appearing pro bono in tv spots and then some for @entity289			1
the @entity290 , or @entity290 , hailed @entity2 for his 12 years performing for nearly 90 military personnel in 13 countries			1
he connected many more times one - on - one			0
that might mean boosting the confidence of an up - and - coming comedian , bringing the first smile to former @entity299 roommate and close friend @entity300 after he was paralyzed or reaching out personally to young people suffering from serious illnesses			0
" i could n't believe it , " @entity120 ireporter @entity303 said about @entity2 ' chartering a plane , at his own expense , to visit and trade jokes with his ailing daughter in 2004			1
" i felt very privileged that he came to spend the day with her like that			0
it was the most moving thing i 've ever seen in my life			0
" @entity315 ' families : a ' comedic @entity316 ' survived by wife and three children yet as his death showed , @entity2 was n't always upbeat			1
he made no secret about his battles with substance abuse , even as he joked that " cocaine is @entity325 's way of telling you that you too much money			2
" his fight did n't get easier as he got older ; if anything , it got harder			0
" when you relapse , you fall deeper , " @entity2 told @entity331 in 2009			1
" i found myself drinking to blackouts			0
it 's like your brain goes into witness protection			2
" beyond that , his media representative @entity337 noted that @entity2 " has been battling severe depression of late			1
" his personal life was n't always smooth either			0
he had a son , @entity341 , with his first wife , @entity342			0
@entity2 then spent 19 years with wife @entity343 -- a union that led to two more children , @entity346 and @entity347 , before ending in divorce in 2008			1
in october 2011 , he wed graphic designer @entity349 in @entity350 , @entity40			1
on her @entity353 feed , his daughter @entity346 remembered her dad with a quote from @entity357 's " @entity356			1
" " in one of the stars i shall be living			0
in one of them i shall be laughing			0
and so it will be as if all the stars were laughing , when you look at the sky at night ... you -- only you -- will have stars that can laugh			0
