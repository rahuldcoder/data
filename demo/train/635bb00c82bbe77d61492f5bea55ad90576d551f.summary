smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high			1
they should break 39 billion tons this year			0
but there 's also some good news , a new study published tuesday said			0
the rate at which people are polluting the air may be leveling off			0
in the @entity14 , emissions contributing to global warming even dropped last year			2
the @entity15 pumped 3.7 % less carbon dioxide into the air in 2012 than in the previous year ; @entity18 1.8 % less			1
globally , greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year , and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole , said researchers at @entity27 's @entity26			2
justices to review greenhouse gas regulation drop in the bucket it 's an improvement -- but a drop in the bucket by global emission standards			1
greenhouse gases are blowing into the atmosphere at rates 61 % higher than they were in 1990 , the baseline year for the @entity38			1
the international agreement is designed to decrease emissions contributing to global warming by holding its signees to reduction goals			0
the vast majority of the world 's nations have signed on to it			2
the @entity15 is not one of them			0
but the world 's largest carbon emitter , which wrested the dubious title from the @entity15 in recent years , pumped 5.9 % more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year			1
@entity56 contributed 7.7 % more emissions in 2012			2
path to catastrophe not only must the increase stop , the researchers said , but industrialized nations must achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions			1
time is running out to stop the world from reaching a dreading global warming threshold			0
the world is on a course with current emission levels to reach a rise in global temperatures of 2 degrees @entity73 or more and end up in the worst climate change scenario issued by the @entity76 panel on climate change			0
the study includes a carbon atlas , which shows levels of pollution emitted by each nation and their development over the last 50 years			0
in 2012 , the largest contributors of greenhouse gases were @entity51 with 27 % , the @entity15 with 14 % and the @entity87 with 10 %			1
on an individual basis , @entity51 and the @entity87 were at the same level , with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year			2
@entity15 still polluted the most by far , with more than 17 tons of carbon gas emitted per person in 2012			1
the ' nuclear renaissance : ' what went wrong ?			0

greenhouse gas emissions are 61 % higher than they were in 1990
in the @entity14 , they have fallen ; the @entity15 produced 3.7 % less in 2012
@entity51 is the biggest polluter with 27 % of the world 's emissions
but pollution per person is highest in the @entity15
