-- the earthquake in @entity2 , southwestern @entity3 , last may left around 69,000 people dead and 15 million people displaced			2
now ecologists have assessed the earthquake 's impact on biodiversity and the habitat for some of the last existing wild giant pandas			1
giant pandas are more endangered than ever since the 2008 @entity2 earthquake			1
according to the report published in " @entity19 " , 23 percent of the pandas ' habitat in the study area was destroyed , and fragmentation of the remaining habitat could hinder panda reproduction			1
the @entity2 region is designated as a global hotspot for biodiversity , according to @entity26			2
home to more than 12,000 species of plants and 1,122 species of vertebrates , the area includes more than half of the habitat for the @entity36 's wild giant panda population , said study lead author @entity37 of the @entity38 in @entity39			1
" we estimate that above 60 percent of the wild giant panda population was affected to some extent by the earthquake , " said @entity37 in the report			1
in an effort to develop conservation strategies for the panda 's remaining habitat , @entity37 and his colleagues used satellite imagery to determine the pandas ' habitat loss and fragmentation in the @entity55 region , which is adjacent to the earthquake 's epicenter			2
since forests are the main vegetation type used by the pandas , the authors compared forested areas in satellite images from september 2007 , before the earthquake , to images after the earthquake and its aftershocks , in july 2008			0
the authors then combined results based on these satellite data with criteria that make forests suitable for pandas , including elevation , slope incline and presence of bamboo			0
their analyses revealed that more than 354 square kilometers , or about 23 percent , of the pandas ' habitat was converted to bare land			1
of the remaining habitat , the researchers found that large habitat areas had been fragmented into smaller , disconnected patches , which @entity37 says can be just as harmful as habitat destruction			0
" it is probable that habitat fragmentation has separated the giant panda population inhabiting this region , which could be as low as 35 individuals , " said @entity37			1
" this kind of isolation increases their risk of extinction in the wild , due in part to a higher likelihood of inbreeding			0
" @entity37 and his colleagues proposed a plan to encourage pandas to move between patches using specially protected corridors			0
they also recommend areas to be protected outside of nature reserves and that post-earthquake relocation of affected towns takes panda habitat into consideration			0
" it is vital to the survival of this species that measures are taken to protect panda habitat outside nature reserves , " said @entity37			0
" giant pandas in this region are more vulnerable than ever to human disturbance , including post-earthquake reconstruction and tourism			2
when coupled with these increasing human activities , natural disasters create unprecedented challenges for biodiversity conservation			0

new report on affect of 2008 @entity2 earthquake on wild giant panda population
report : 23 percent of habitat has *disappeared* ; 60 percent of giant pandas affected
