-- @entity1 returned to the top of the @entity3 on saturday , but it gave manager @entity4 little hope that his side can win the title			1
the @entity8 , who was triumphant in the first two seasons of his first spell at the @entity13 club , remains adamant that @entity14 still hold the advantage			0
@entity1 's 3 - 0 win over @entity17 put @entity4 's team a point above @entity20 , who travel to @entity22 on sunday , with @entity14 another point back after a similarly comprehensive 4 - 1 victory against eighth - placed @entity25 earlier saturday			1
@entity27 's team , who have already won the @entity29 , have two games in hand on @entity1			1
" we have five matches to play in the @entity3 and we have to try to win all five , " said @entity4 , who returned to @entity32 last year after leaving @entity33			2
" we do n't depend on ourselves and we never did			0
i was waiting for the moment where we could be top of the league and depend on ourselves and i was waiting for that moment to say , ' yes , now , we are candidates because we depend on ourselves , ' but that never happened			0
" with @entity20 we have to play against them , so we have one match we have three points to discuss with them -- with @entity14 we do not play so they have their destiny in their hands and the only thing we can do is to continue to win matches			1
" @entity50 winger @entity49 gave @entity1 the lead in his first start since signing in january , then won a penalty from which @entity54 followed up his own saved attempt to net his 250th career goal			0
@entity58 midfielder @entity57 wrapped up the win with 18 minutes left			0
while @entity1 may still be involved in the @entity61 , albeit nursing wounds after a 3 - 1 defeat away to @entity64 in midweek , @entity14 's focus remains on a second domestic title in three seasons			1
" we are enjoying a very good second round of fixtures where the results are much better than the first half , " @entity27 said after @entity14 moved six points clear of fourth - placed @entity68			2
" we 've had four wins and one draw in our last five games -- maybe we had low performances in the month of february and at the start of march but i think that now the team has come back to its best performances			0
" @entity80 moved up to sixth place with a 4 - 0 win at @entity83 , but @entity84 could reclaim that position from the defending champion by beating bottom club @entity87 on monday			1
former @entity1 star @entity88 scored twice for @entity80 , who face @entity90 in the second leg of the @entity61 quarterfinals on wednesday , while @entity94 striker @entity93 and @entity95 also netted			0
it lifted more pressure off manager @entity98 , who rested several key players following his team 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity102 champions @entity90 in the midweek home leg			1
" the focus could only be on this game but you could see we 've left a few players at home and not played a few players , and we are hoping they will be fit for wednesday night 's game at @entity90 , " he said			0
@entity111 moved off the bottom of the table with a 2 - 1 win at @entity115 , who were missing top scorer @entity117 due to an injury that rules the @entity120 striker out of the @entity121			1
@entity122 grabbed a crucial 1 - 0 win at @entity124 that put both clubs level , five points above the relegation zone			2
@entity128 moved up to 12th with a 1 - 0 win over @entity130 that left the @entity132 team in a nervous position above the bottom five			2
@entity134 moved up to 14th with a 3 - 0 win at second - bottom @entity136 .			0

@entity4 plays down @entity1 's chances of winning @entity140 title
@entity142 two points above third - placed @entity14 after saturday 's win
