-- the death of famed @entity3 editor @entity2 on tuesday marks the symbolic end of an important era in @entity7 journalism , one that , unfortunately , was very different than our own			1
@entity2 turned the @entity3 from a sleepy , second - rate publication into a powerhouse of investigative journalism			1
during the early 1970s , he was at the editorial helm when his reporters broke the @entity15 that led to president @entity17 's resignation and were part of the group of journalists who published the @entity21			2
@entity2 was a true believer in the power of journalism to expose the abuses and misuse of political power			1
he was devoted to a vision of the news media in @entity7 politics that took seriously the responsibility for the press to go wherever was necessary to keep politicians in check			0
@entity2 wrote that , " i started looking for the truth after hearing the official version of a truth			1
" while @entity2 liked to sell a newspaper as much as anyone , the way he would do so would be through publishing the most hard - hitting stories possible			1
that era of journalism has faded			2
@entity2 's death came on the same day that @entity45 released a report showing how more and more @entity7 are just listening to like - minded sources of news			1
journalists react to ' icon ' @entity2 's death journalism in this era is less about speaking truth to power than speaking to those who agree on a particular version of the truth			1
as @entity45 reported , " when it comes to getting news about politics and government , liberals and conservatives inhabit different worlds			0
there is little overlap in the news sources they turn to and trust			0
" the business challenges facing much of the media have created immense pressure on news organizations , reporters and producers to cater to audiences that will enhance the bottom line rather than to produce work that will truly challenge the holders of political and economic power			0
this certainly does not describe all the news media , as there are many great journalists and some terrific news outlets , but it has become an unfortunate trend			0
the zeal for investigation that @entity2 once nurtured has , for many , been eclipsed by the imperative to provide an ideological echo chamber			2
@entity2 was far from perfect			2
as his biographers will recount , he made many mistakes in his career			0
in his zeal for the big story , he could be sloppy			0
he allowed the publication of a story about an 8 - year - old heroin addict that won the @entity101 , but which turned out to be a hoax			0
but @entity2 made a huge contribution to newspaper journalism when it was at its prime			1
he and his generation of editors and reporters helped to show how the media could be an indispensable watchdog in our political system			0
@entity2 's death should serve as a reminder of the kind of news to which we all need to aspire .			2
