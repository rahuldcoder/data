@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 cosmonaut @entity3 became the first human in space -- the date was april 12 , 1961			1
twenty years later on april 12 , astronauts @entity8 and @entity10 got on board the space shuttle @entity12 , a craft that looked more like a plane that a rocket ship			1
it launched an entirely new era in space flight			1
now , on the anniversary of those two historic events , @entity20 is scheduled to announce where the retiring orbiters @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 will call home			1
@entity20 administrator @entity28 will make the announcement tuesday during a ceremony at the @entity0 commemorating that first flight of @entity12 on april 12 , 1981			1
@entity20 officials say the orbiter @entity26 , being readied for the final shuttle flight this summer , will be the backdrop for the announcement			1
hundreds of center workers are expected to attend -- many of them will likely lose their jobs when the shuttle program ends			2
because the announcement is being made at @entity0 , the speculation is that the visitor center here will be awarded one of the shuttles			2
it is one of more than 20 locations around the country with collective fingers crossed			2
the drama mirrors the bidding to host an @entity55			0
in @entity61 , home of the @entity60 , members of that state 's delegation publicly lobbied for a shuttle			2
rep. @entity63 , @entity64 , said during a news conference , " no city in the world deserves an orbiter more than @entity69 , @entity61			0
" besides @entity1 and @entity61 , the @entity70 in @entity71 wants one			0
in fact , one wall of a new space gallery where a shuttle would be housed is already up			1
the museum 's president , @entity76 , says museum officials do n't have any inside information			0
" i think that confident may be too strong a word			0
i think that hopeful is probably a better one , " he says			0
@entity83 in @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88 , @entity89 , also all want one			0
landing an orbiter will be huge			0
the @entity0 visitor center estimates a shuttle will bring in 200,000 more guests every year			2
the economic impact to the area is estimated at $ 15 million			2
at @entity85 's @entity97 , executive director @entity96 told @entity2 , " figure over 300,000 people additional to the @entity97 , to @entity85			0
couple that with $ 106 million in economic benefit , we think that 's a pretty good deal			0
" rep. @entity102 plans to attend husband 's shuttle launch a good deal , @entity96 says because the winning locations have to fork over $ 28.8 million to @entity20 for the vehicles			1
they also must guarantee a climate - controlled building will be constructed to house their shuttle			0
that 's still a bargain , officials at the bidding locations say , because of return on investment as one of only three locations in the world that will have a shuttle that flew in space			1
one of the orbiters -- @entity24 , the oldest -- is already believed to be spoken for			1
the overwhelming odds are it 's heading to the @entity127			0
the @entity128 , a test shuttle , which never flew into space , is there now			1
it would be awarded , at a discounted price , to one of the locations that does not get either @entity25 or @entity26			1
the announcement of the winning locations will make one thing crystal clear : the space shuttle program is coming to a close			1
the winged lifting bodies launched satellites , built a space station , launched and repaired a telescope			0
now , they become museum pieces .			0

several sites are *vying* to be the final homes of the retiring space shuttles
the shuttles @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 carry historic and economic value
@entity20 administrator @entity28 will announce tuesday where the shuttles will go
april 12 marks the date of the first human space flight and , 20 years later , the first shuttle flight
