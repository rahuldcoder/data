cautious doctors replacing former vice president @entity0 's heart defibrillator in 2007 modified it so it could n't be hacked by terrorists who might try to kill him , @entity0 told @entity7 's @entity6 in an interview that aired sunday night on @entity10 ' " @entity9			1
" @entity0 's cardiologist , dr. @entity11 , was interviewed along with his famous patient			1
" it seemed to me to be a bad idea for the vice president of the @entity16 to have a device that maybe somebody ... might be able to get into , hack into , " @entity11 said			0
turning to @entity0 , the cardiologist added : " i worried that someone could kill you			1
" so , when @entity0 needed his implanted defibrillator replaced in 2007 , @entity11 ordered the manufacturer to disable the wireless feature , thus preventing anyone from sending a signal to the device and shocking the vice president into cardiac arrest			1
@entity6 's interview with @entity0 and @entity11 will air tuesday on @entity7 's " @entity31 360			1
" @entity0 is the author of a new book , " heart : an @entity34 , " co-written by @entity11			1
it 's described as a medical tale that looks at breakthroughs in cardiac care over the past 40 years			2
it 's also a story about how @entity0 's heart disease overlapped with key moments in history			1
case in point : around 9/11 , @entity0 said , there was no time to worry about his health			1
he 'd already had several heart attacks by that point			1
" i did n't think about my health			0
i was thinking about the problem we were dealing with , " @entity0 said			1
but life has a persistent way of intruding -- and intrude his heart problems did -- many times over @entity0 's long political career			1
just about two months after taking the oath as vice president , @entity0 wrote a secret letter of resignation			2
it was pending for the entire time he served			0
@entity0 wrote the letter because he saw a gap in the @entity16 @entity67			2
if a vice president is alive but incapacitated , there 's nothing in the @entity67 that allows for that person 's removal			2
worried that he might find himself in that position , he penned the letter			2
@entity0 unapologetic in documentary the 72 - year - old @entity0 suffered his first heart attack in 1978 , at age 37 , while campaigning for @entity77			1
it was the first of five heart attacks			1
he suffered subsequent heart attacks in 1984 , 1988 , 2000 and 2010			1
@entity0 also underwent an open heart surgery and had a pacemaker implanted			1
in 2010 , @entity0 had a left ventricular assist device , or @entity84 , implanted to help his heart pump			1
the @entity84 , a battery - operated heart pump , is basically used to buy people time -- a last resort , if you will -- while they await a new heart			2
@entity0 waited 20 months for a transplant , undergoing the procedure last year			2
after appearing frail and weak , he now seems full of energy and is back to a normal weight			0
his color has returned and he has no shortness of breath			0
@entity6 : three things i learned about @entity0 asked by @entity6 how he is feeling , @entity0 said " fantastic			1
" " now i 'm to the point where -- i literally , you know , feel like i have a new heart , a lot more energy than i had previously			2
there are n't any real physical limits on what i do			0
i fish , i hunt			0
and -- i do n't ski , but that 's because of my knees , not my heart			1
so it 's -- it 's been a miracle , " he sahttp : / / www.secure-medicine.org/public/publications/icd-study.pdfid			1
it 's like having a new lease on life			2
" you wake up every morning with a smile on your face because you 've got a new day you never expected to have			0
and there 's a sense , well , of wonderment			0
nothing short of magical , " @entity0 said			2
@entity0 : fast facts @entity125 had 95 % blockage before august heart procedure @entity129 a defibrillator may sound improbable , but researchers have demonstrated that it is possible			1
@entity132 , associate professor of computer science and engineering at the @entity136 , and colleagues showed in a 2008 study that they could use their own hardware to communicate with an implantable cardioverter deÔ¨Åbrillator			0
" we wanted to get ahead of any potential threat , " @entity132 said			0
" we knew that medical devices were advancing , and we wanted to get the medical device community focused on understanding the risks , so that future medical devices with more wireless communication capabilities , and so on , were adequately secured			0
" it was n't easy , @entity132 said , but by studying the signals that hospital equipment would normally send to the device , researchers were able to figure out how to generate their own signals to communicate with it			0
from a few centimeters away from the device , they could change the defibrillator 's settings and turn its therapies on and off , @entity132 said			0
the device was the current model at the time , but now represents an older generation of such devices			0
the @entity163 considers the security of medical devices to be an important issue , @entity132 said , and the medical community is working on figuring out how to improve them			0
in the meantime , though , the risk for most people is incredibly low , @entity132 said			0
" if i had any medical reason to get an implantable defibrillator or a pacemaker , i would have no hesitation in doing so , even the one that we studied , " @entity132 said			0
" these are lifesaving devices and truly the benefits outweigh the risks			0
" the @entity182 is holding a workshop on november 19 to discuss privacy and security issues that arise from the increased connectivity of devices with each other and with people -- the so - called " @entity191 " -- including in the health arena .			0
