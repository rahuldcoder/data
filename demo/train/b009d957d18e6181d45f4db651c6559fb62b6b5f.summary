-- nude photos and other potentially objectionable materials have been showing up in the @entity4 application store in recent weeks , raising questions about @entity7 's ability to control @entity4 content			1
an @entity4 app called @entity10 was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced			1
in the most recent example , a nude photo of a young woman , reported to be 15 years old , showed up on an @entity4 application called " @entity10 , " according to @entity17 and @entity18 , an app review site			1
@entity0 could not independently confirm the young woman 's age			0
the photo , which apparently was submitted by one of the photo - sharing app 's users , prompted @entity7 to remove the entire mobile application from its online store			1
@entity28 , maker of the @entity10 app , which lets users upload and posts photos of people and then rank them based on " hotness , " says in a statement on its web site that it agrees with @entity7 's decision to yank the phone application from its online store			2
@entity39 also says its policies prohibit people from posting nude photos to the application			0
neither @entity39 nor @entity7 responded to requests for comment			0
about a week earlier , another mobile phone application , " @entity48 , " showcased a photo of a topless woman and also was pulled from the @entity4 app store			1
" @entity7 will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content , such as pornography , " an @entity7 company spokesman said at the time			2
the explicit material is putting attention on @entity7 's attempts to filter out potentially objectionable apps before they 're posted on its app store			1
the @entity4 app store , with more than 50,000 applications , is the most popular entertainment and information venue of its kind for mobile phones			1
observers say the successful app store buoys the @entity4 's popularity and adds to @entity7 's sterling image as a hip and family - friendly company			1
the explicit content has the potential to tarnish that image			0
but @entity7 , like any company or web site that hosts user - submitted content , may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store			1
some @entity4 apps are developed by @entity7 , but many are submitted for approval by third - party developers			1
@entity88 , a clinical professor of law at @entity90 , said it 's unlikely @entity7 or app developers could be held liable for potentially illegal content that might show up in phone apps , as long as they did n't know about the questionable content in advance			1
it would be impossible for @entity7 or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store , since much of the content is submitted by users , he said			1
as the quantity of new apps and updates for apps increases , it becomes all the more difficult for the company to keep up , said @entity109 , associate editor of @entity110 , a blog about all things @entity7			0
@entity113 , editor in chief of @entity115 , a technology blog , said the impossibility of policing all app store content should free @entity7 from some blame			2
" it 's completely out of @entity7 's control that someone uploaded a nude photo , and to some extent , it 's out of the [ app ] developer 's hands as well , " he said			1
more pressing , @entity113 said , are @entity7 's nebulous policies about which apps get the company 's stamp of approval			0
@entity7 does not tell developers or the public exactly how the decision process works , he said			2
@entity7 did not respond to @entity0 's request for comment on this story			0
the mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from @entity7 and move on to other phones , said @entity142 , an app developer			2
in some cases , applications have been banned from the @entity4 app store for showcasing material that also would be easily accessible through @entity148 or by using @entity7 's mobile web browser			1
a @entity151 application , for example , reportedly was pulled by @entity7 because it streamed a song with offensive lyrics			0
band leader @entity155 lashed out against @entity7 on his web site , calling the company hypocritical and pointing out that the song in question also was available on @entity148			0
in a similar incident , a @entity161 app called " @entity162 " was pulled because it gave access to offensive words on @entity161			0
it was later put back on the app store			0
and an @entity4 app that allowed users to shake a digital crying baby to death was yanked from the app store in april			1
@entity7 issued an apology , calling the app " deeply offensive " and a " mistake			0
" unlike @entity7 , which acts as a gatekeeper , @entity175 lets developers post games and other programs to its @entity181 app store without going through a screening process			2
@entity142 said he favors this idea , which lets the @entity181 store 's community flag objectionable content			0
@entity7 has said it approves 96 percent of submitted @entity4 apps			1
in a recent update to the @entity4 software , @entity7 included controls that let users choose which types of content they would like to block from their phones			2
iphone apps now come with age - appropriateness labels , submitted by developers			0
@entity109 said this new parental - control system offers " fine - grained controls " and helps @entity4 owners decide what content they want to buy			2
the company is doing anything it can to try to keep pornography and offensive material off the site for public relations reasons , he said			0
" they 'd much rather hang onto their image as a family - friendly company " than let offensive material in , he said			0
" i think they 've really cultivated that			0

reports say @entity4 app posted nude photo of 15 - year - old girl
@entity7 approves mobile phone applications before posting them
some say it is impossible for @entity7 to filter out all objectionable material
legal expert : @entity7 and developers unlikely to be held liable for user - posted content
