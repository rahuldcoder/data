-- " i was finding it hard to breathe , and i really thought that was it for me			2
i thought ' this is it - i 'm not coming out of here , ' " said earthquake survivor @entity5			1
she was speaking from her hospital bed in @entity9 , @entity10 , after being rescued from the rubble of a five - story building that collapsed during tuesday 's 6.3 - magnitude earthquake			1
@entity14 had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the @entity19 building , drawing international attention to her plight			1
in the 24 hours she spent under the rubble , @entity14 , 57 , said she gave up hope , and accepted she would die			1
" i 'm very lucky , i 'm very , very lucky , " she said			2
she said she remembered vividly the moment the quake struck			2
she had taken over at the reception desk to allow a colleague to go for lunch , and she was logging onto a computer when the " rumbling " started			1
" it happened so quickly			2
i heard the rumble and then stuff was falling from the ceiling and i thought it was best to go under the desk rather than try to get out			1
there was n't any time to think , but i am lucky i did n't go to the stairs			2
there would n't have been time			2
i do n't know what might have happened			2
" a lot of concrete pieces fell on me and the desk sort of bent completely around			1
my arm was trapped under a huge piece of concrete			1
it was starting to swell and i could n't feel my hand			0
i could n't get my feet out , and there was a lot of broken glass and electrical wires so i could n't move at all			0
i was stuck there in a little cubby hole , " she said			0
it was then , in severe pain and struggling to breathe , that @entity14 realized she may not survive			1
she began to call close friends and family on her mobile phone			0
" i was more or less saying goodbye			0
i just wanted to tell people that i loved them and to say goodbye			0
" she was unable to reach her @entity66 - based son , @entity65 , and she left a goodbye message on his voicemail			0
some time after those initial calls , @entity14 says she passed out			1
she was awakened by shaking , but she says she does n't know whether it was an aftershock or the building further collapsing			1
whatever it was , it changed her fortune			0
" when i came to , it ( the piece of concrete on her ) had moved and i was able to wriggle a bit			0
once that came off and i could breathe again , i started to think maybe i could i make it			0
the whole time i was thinking about my family and my friends and i just wanted to make it out			0
i was hoping someone would rescue me soon			0
" @entity14 ' next few hours were remarkable			1
her son , @entity65 , gave her number to a @entity66 radio station , and soon conversations with her were being broadcast internationally			1
she spoke to the media from underneath her crushed desk until her phone battery died			1
listen to @entity5 talking to the media @entity14 was not rescued until early wednesday afternoon			1
she was taken to hospital with cracked ribs , heavy bruising and multiple cuts			1
she said the feeling of relief was hard to describe , especially when she saw the state of the building			1
" while i was in there i did n't know what was going on			0
i was just trapped under my desk , you know			1
when i got out it was such a shock			0
the building was n't there anymore			2
the job the search teams did was just fantastic			0
" @entity14 says she now needs to assess the damage to her possessions , and after experiencing two major earthquakes and many aftershocks , she may decide to move away from the area			1
" i do n't know if i 'll stay			0
i feel a bit like i have nothing keeping me here			0
i do n't know if my place has survived			0
" there are other anxieties too			0
" i am also a bit worried about where i could work			0
i think i would be too afraid to go into a tall building for a while , " she said .			2
