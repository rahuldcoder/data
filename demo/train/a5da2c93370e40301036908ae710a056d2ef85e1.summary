-- the jury in the @entity3 trial has one decision left to make : should she live or die ? after months of dramatic testimony full of so many twists and turns that people lined up for seats in the @entity12 courtroom , jurors began deliberations tuesday to decide whether @entity14 should get the death penalty or life in prison for murdering her ex-boyfriend			1
earlier this month , jurors convicted @entity14 of first - degree murder and found that she was " exceptionally cruel " when she killed @entity3 in 2008			1
she stabbed him 29 times , slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face			0
on tuesday , the same jury that found @entity14 guilty of murder deliberated for about an hour and a half before adjourning for the day			1
they are scheduled to come back to court and continue weighing her fate wednesday at 10 a.m. ( 1 p.m. et )			1
@entity14 pleaded for her life to be spared , telling jurors tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and make a positive impact on inmates			1
she also called the murder of @entity45 " the worst mistake " she 'd ever made , " the worst thing i 've ever done			2
" she could n't have imagined herself capable of such a grizzly crime			0
" but i know that i was , " she said			0
" and for that i 'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer			2
" she told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child			2
she showed several family photos from holidays and vacations			0
she claimed she was a gentle person who caught spiders in cups and took them outside rather than kill them			0
and she showed the jurors several pieces of her artwork			0
" i 'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices , " she said , adding that she would no longer be able to paint with oil , either			0
it was a drastic change in tone from less than two weeks ago , when a tearful @entity14 , minutes after her murder conviction , told a local television station that she wanted to be sentenced to death			1
explaining her decision not to request the death penalty , @entity14 said tuesday that her family -- to whom she pointed in the courtroom -- gave her the strength to continue living			1
her previous comments about her desire to die were sincere when she expressed them , @entity14 said			1
" each time i said that , though i meant it , " she said , " i lacked perspective			0
" she noted she could bring " people together in a constructive and positive way " by participating in various programs , including prisoner literacy initiatives , her " @entity93 " t - shirts , which would benefit victims of domestic violence , and by donating her hair so it could be used to make wigs for sick children			0
beginning about 90 minutes later than scheduled , @entity14 , 32 , said she never wanted the " graphic , mortifying , horrific details ( of her and @entity45 's relationship ) paraded out into the public arena			1
" " it 's never been an intention of mine to malign his name or character , " she said			0
defense attorney @entity103 argued tuesday that @entity14 ' life should be spared			1
" we 're not talking about whether or not to convict			0
we 're talking about whether or not to kill			0
and so when we talk about that , it matters that she was 27 years old and she had no criminal history , " she said			0
" it matters that she had n't done anything wrong in her life befo re that			0
" prosecutor @entity115 said pointing to @entity14 ' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared was n't a valid defense			1
" it 's an entitlement road that they want you to travel when they talk to you about the fact that she 's a good artist , " he said			0
" it does n't mean anything			0
all it means is , give her special or preferential treatment			0
" he argued that jurors should sentence @entity14 to death			1
" you have a duty , and that duty really means that you actually do the honest , right thing , even though it may be difficult , " he said			1
" and in this case ... the only thing you can do based on the mitigating circumstances and their lack of , is to return a verdict of death			1
" during the trial , @entity14 claimed she killed @entity45 in self - defense after he attacked her			1
after the guilty verdict , she told a local television station that she had no interest in life in prison			2
" i said years ago that i 'd rather get death than life , and that still is true today , " she told @entity12 television station @entity151			2
" i believe death is the ultimate freedom , so i 'd rather just have my freedom as soon as i can get it			0
" the penalty phase of the trial took a sudden break monday , when the judge said that proceedings could not continue and that @entity14 would make the statement to the jury			1
the adjournment followed judge @entity165 ' dismissal of a defense motion for a mistrial and ended a session in which the defense called no witnesses on @entity14 ' behalf			2
also denied was a second request by @entity14 ' lawyers to withdraw from the case			2
@entity14 , who testified for 18 days during the trial , was not cross-examined after her tuesday statement , which @entity165 said was not under oath			2
for @entity14 to be sentenced to death , the jury 's decision must be unanimous			1
in the case of a deadlock , a new jury would be chosen for this phase only			0
if @entity14 is given a sentence of death , she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state			1
