-- @entity2 , the world famous architect , was walking down the street one day when the realization hit him like lightning : " i thought , ' i should become an architect , ' " he recalls			1
he was 25 at the time and " wasting time " writing film scripts			2
" i am so unbelievably happy that i wasted time , " he says , " because wasting time enabled me to have a more open relationship with the world			1
@entity14 also taught him something about architecture			2
" if you write a script , you try to stitch episodes together so that , at the end , you have a sort of suspense to a conclusion or a climax , " he says			2
" architecture is very similar : you create a series of spatial moments and find a way to relate them to each other with the same purpose			0
an architect writes scripts also , but for people , not for actors			1
" conjuring film scenarios " felt very exciting , but not deeply serious , " he says			0
his epiphany came when he realized that architecture was a way to do for serious reasons what he had been doing for frivolous reasons			0
view a hi - res gallery of @entity2 ' buildings it would be 18 years before he would build his first commission , the @entity47 , in 1987			1
" i started very late [ but ] it meant that , at my age now , i am not an exhausted wreck ... i still feel relatively fresh , " he said			0
@entity2 currently has a new , experimental performing arts center in @entity52 under construction			1
he has designed shops and catwalks for @entity56 and a @entity58 summer house for sculptor @entity59			0
his 2004 library in @entity61 is acclaimed as a @entity62 for libraries and his @entity64 in @entity65 won him the 2000 @entity66			0
but @entity2 ' favorite project is a 54 - floor anti-skyscraper that critics consider " the most breathtaking building of his career " and perhaps even " the greatest work of architecture built in this century			1
" his tower for @entity76 , known in @entity77 as " @entity78 , " is intended as a demonstration of how , in reaching for tallness , skyscrapers " reach a kind of redundancy			1
" read more : @entity86 's ' @entity85 ' towers depending on your vantage point , it can resemble a z - shape or a loop and is " a building that is constantly mutable and that emanates creativity , " @entity2 says			1
" i think i can genuinely claim there has never been a building with that many identities			1
" @entity2 says it 's also significant that the building was rubber stamped in " a part of the world where stability is prized above everything else and where identities are supposed to be immutable			1
" the decision to compete for the @entity76 commission over the @entity109 redevelopment was controversial			1
@entity2 says , while it was " wrenching " to be criticized for his choice of client , " the moment we started the competition , i was convinced that @entity114 , no matter how it 's evolving , is on the way to become a modern country			1
" besides which , he argues , " we all have a stake in the outcome of @entity114			0
" photo gallery : @entity125 's shimmering shrine to art of course , coming up with a hot idea is only one part of an architect 's job			2
the other , less celebrated but no less important part , is getting the thing built			0
beyond its unusual shape , @entity2 says @entity76 is his favorite building because he is proud of its arduous route to fruition			1
" it took 10 years to realize , and i have been in @entity77 once every month			1
you can imagine the degree of engagement that implies , " he says			0
" the total amount of diplomacy that was necessary , the constant negotiation with a different political environment , a different language , a different symbolism ... it required an unbelievable effort			0
" he is " unambiguously " pleased with the outcome , which houses administration , production and broadcasting facilities for 10,000 workers			1
while designing new headquarters for @entity154 in @entity155 in the 1990s , he had noticed how alienation and paranoia percolated when everyone was working in small , separate bungalows			0
" since this was @entity114 , we felt we could introduce a different mode there -- namely , a building that asserted that the company was a connector , where everyone was connected to everyone else , and each component part of a single hierarchy and a single integrated system			2
in a sense , it was a deliberate assessment of what would be possible in a @entity176 country , " he says			0
@entity2 notes that exploring other cultures is a relatively new requirement for architects			1
" one generation ago , an architect would expect the largest part of his oeuvre is built in an environment he knows very well , " he says			2
" we are part of a unique generation where , for the first time , it 's likely that most of the buildings you do are in countries that you do n't initially know			0
therefore , there is an enormous amount of anthropological interest that you have to develop , in order to be precise enough to do justice to those opportunities			0
" one of the first foreign cultures that fascinated @entity2 was ancient @entity201			1
" they had a relatively limited repertoire of things -- temples , housing , ports , shops -- and they replicated that repertoire in many parts of the world in completely unique conditions			2
" " i also have an affinity with @entity215 architecture because it 's not religious , it 's not mystical			0
it 's efficient and interested in how things perform , more than how things appear , " he said			0
his favorite example is the @entity220 in @entity201 , which he first visited on a solo trip to @entity222 as an 18 - year - old			2
" it 's really part of the city , but once you are inside , you 're immediately transported to another world -- which is , as i said , not mystical , not religious , but somehow you feel elated			2
" @entity2 still visits the @entity220 every time he is in @entity201 , and still finds variations			1
" there are days that i do n't even look at the @entity231			0
i simply discover the detail of the perimeter			0
there are days when i only look at the outside , or i only look at a portico and try to understand how big it actually is			0
" so i think , in spite of its apparently simple manifestation , it 's an incredible box full of tricks , and interesting differences somehow working together			1
" watch " @entity244 " on @entity245 at 16.30 on tuesday october 2 and 04.30 on wednesday october 3			0

@entity248 architect @entity2 says his greatest *achievement* is the @entity76 building in @entity77
the 54 - floor tower houses 10,000 workers in two *adjoining* towers , took 10 years to complete
@entity2 : @entity256 is " box of tricks " that " transports you to another world "
