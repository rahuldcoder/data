@entity0 -- a @entity2 who defied orders and braved a blizzard of enemy fire to recover wounded and dead fellow @entity7 and @entity8 troops during a six - hour firefight in @entity8 received the @entity11 thursday from president @entity12			1
" i know that you 've grappled with the grief of that day , that you have said that your efforts were somehow a failure because your teammates did n't come home , " @entity12 told @entity13 , who became the first living @entity2 to be recognized with the nation 's highest military honor for actions in @entity8 or @entity17			1
" but , as your commander - in - chief , i want you to know it 's quite the opposite			0
you did your duty above and beyond , and you kept the faith with the highest traditions of the @entity2 that you love			2
" " the award honors the men who gave their lives that day , and the men who were in that fight , " @entity13 said , according to a @entity2 newsletter			1
" i did n't do anything more than any other @entity2 would			2
i was put in an extraordinary circumstance , and i just did my job			0
" the incident began before dawn on september 8 , 2009 , as a patrol made up of @entity8 forces and their @entity7 trainers were making their way on foot up a narrow valley in @entity47 province to meet with elders in a village			1
@entity13 was about a mile away when @entity51 fighters ambushed the patrol , firing from three sides , @entity12 said			1
@entity13 and staff sgt. @entity53 could hear the ambush over the radio as the @entity51 fighters unleashed a firestorm from nearby hills , @entity12 said			1
soon a number of men were killed and several @entity8 and @entity7 were pinned down , including four members of @entity13 's team , @entity12 said			1
" four times , @entity62 and @entity53 asked permission to go in ; four times they were denied , " @entity12 said			2
" it was , they were told , too dangerous			0
" but @entity13 and @entity53 left their relatively safe location and jumped into a humvee , with @entity13 manning a gun in the turret , his body and head fully exposed to a rain of fire from @entity78 , machine guns , mortars and rocket - propelled grenades , @entity12 said			1
as they reached wounded @entity8 soldiers , @entity13 jumped out and loaded them into the humvee , then drove them back to safety , @entity12 said			1
" those who were there called it the most intense combat they had ever seen , " the president said			0
for a second time , the men drove back into the hail of fire to pick up more wounded @entity8 ; when one gun jammed , @entity13 and @entity53 switched to another vehicle , @entity12 said			1
on their third trip , they found a group of wounded @entity7 " desperately trying to escape the bullets , " @entity12 said			1
" @entity53 wedged the humvee right into the line of fire , using the vehicle as a shield			0
with @entity62 on the guns , they helped those @entity7 back to safety as well			2
" @entity62 later confessed , ' i did n't think i was going to die ; i knew i was , ' " @entity12 said			2
" still , they pushed on			0
" they made a fourth trip , and then a fifth			0
on the fifth trip -- now accompanied by others -- they reached the bodies of the four members of @entity13 's team			2
" @entity62 jumped out and ran toward them , drawing all those enemy guns on himself , bullets kicking up the dirt all around him , " @entity12 said			2
" @entity62 and the others who had joined him knelt down , picked up their comrades and , through all those bullets , all the smoke and all the chaos , carried them out , one by one			0
" @entity13 agreed to accept the medal in their names : 1st lt. @entity132 , staff sgt. @entity133 , @entity134 and gunnery sgt. @entity135			0
" i was a failure , " @entity13 told @entity1 last fall			0
that was my whole team			0
" neither @entity12 nor the @entity2 saw it that way			1
a defense official with knowledge of the award process last fall said that just before he retired , the @entity2 commandant , gen. @entity146 , recommended @entity13 for the nation 's highest award for bravery			1
the actions of @entity13 , 23 , saved the lives of 13 @entity7 @entity2 and soldiers and 23 @entity8 soldiers , according to the @entity2 ' @entity11 account			1
he also is credited with killing at least eight @entity51 insurgents during the incident			0
for his role in the battle , staff sgt. @entity157 received the @entity160 , the second - highest decoration that may be bestowed on @entity2			0
@entity13 , who serves in the @entity162 of the @entity163 as a sergeant in his home state of @entity166 , said in november that he did n't want to discuss details of the incident because it was still difficult to think about			0
