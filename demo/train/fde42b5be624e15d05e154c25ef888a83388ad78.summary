@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's her lunch break on a sunny afternoon in @entity0 and instead of chatting with friends in the courtyard , 17 - year old @entity5 is standing in front of a white board inside @entity10			1
she has a fat red marker in her hand and is furiously scribbling around a triangle while muttering about sine and cosine			2
" we 're studying for a final , " she explains while solving for angles			2
" we have a math final today			2
" it is mid-january , just days into the new semester , which is a strange time for a final , but then , this math class is unusual			2
it is taught after school and crams two years of math into two semesters			2
@entity5 , a junior , is not complaining			1
she 's the one who lobbied for the class once she figured out during her sophomore year that she was n't on track to take calculus before graduation			1
" to get into a good university , " she tells me earnestly , " i have to have , at minimum , calculus			2
" pushing kids to math and science @entity5 's sights are set very high			1
her first - choice college is @entity41			2
" she 's an exemplary student			1
i am very proud , " her mother tells me in @entity43 as i sit on the @entity45 front porch			2
@entity5 is successful in high school while so many of her peers are struggling			1
she is studying accelerated math , honors @entity49 , honors chemistry , honors economics and she 's in robotics , where she is vice president of the team			1
half of them are girls			2
@entity5 's teammates call her ' @entity59 , ' because of her tendency to nudge and encourage			1
and the team has been successful , winning a roomful of awards , including one national prize			1
but the lessons @entity5 is learning are about much more than gears , sensors and computer code			1
" one of the things we talk about being on a robotics team is that you ca n't let things happen to you			1
you have to go out and make things happen , " says @entity75 , her robotics coach			2
watch @entity5 in the trailer for " @entity78 : do n't fail me " for @entity5 , that meant writing up a proposal for an accelerated math class , roping in 31 other students to take part , and then literally begging the principal to find the funding			1
@entity75 -- the kids call him @entity88 -- has been teaching at @entity89 for 23 years			2
the school is 94 % @entity91			2
he says most parents of his students are working - class immigrants who have survived by working in food service or landscaping			2
he says they have made a living without higher education and believe their children can get along that way , too , " but that ca n't happen			1
" " more and more of those kind of jobs are just disappearing , " @entity75 tells me			2
" things are getting automated			2
... if you do n't keep your education level up , you will be left out			1
" he 's most worried about @entity91 students			2
they make up one - fifth of the school - age population in the @entity115 and will be 30 % of the adult population by 2050			0
at @entity5 's school , half the students do n't pass @entity1 's proficiency exams , which means they do n't meet the bar for basic knowledge in math , reading and science			1
time.com : why the @entity91 student crisis is going ignored nationally , only half of @entity5 's @entity91 peers graduate on time			1
the reason is complicated , but stems mostly from issues connected to poverty			0
" in many cases the schools lack the resources and personnel to respond adequately to student needs , " explains @entity132 , a professor of education at @entity134			1
" many of the students attending such schools also feel pressure to find jobs to support themselves and their families			0
if they do n't see college as a real option they are even more likely to dropout			1
" most of the kids who attend @entity5 's school are poor			1
more than 83 % of its students are eligible for free or reduced lunch			0
the school is " @entity155 , " meaning it receives federal assistance because it has a lot of high - poverty , high - risk students			0
none of @entity5 's six siblings who attended @entity89 before her graduated from there on time			1
but @entity5 is a go - getter			1
through tears , she tells me a heart - wrenching story about overhearing her father speaking with one of her favorite teachers at her quinceanera -- her 15th birthday celebration			0
the teacher was raving about @entity5 's dreams and strong academics			1
" it 's just a matter of time before she fails , " @entity5 says she heard her dad tell the teacher			1
" it does n't really matter what she does now , she will eventually give up			1
" @entity5 recalls the story for me as tears roll down her cheeks			1
where many students would be disheartened by what they heard , @entity5 was spurred to achieve even more			1
" i kinda just took it and flipped it around like , ' well i 'm going to show you , ' " she explains			0
" i can prove to myself that i can do it			0
" her focus means a grueling schedule			0
after school , there is math class , dancing , band and taking care of her little sister , 10 - year - old @entity201			0
and , of course , robotics			0
by the time she entered @entity89 , the school was renowned for its robotics team			1
the team has six weeks to build a robot from a box of parts			1
they compete with about 52,000 students around the globe			0
those who think it 's all about the robot do n't fully get it			2
how the @entity115 lags in math , science -- and how to improve " the robot is just the thing that gets all the kids here in one place , " @entity75 tells me			0
" what 's really important is all the working together with the different mentors and the adults learning how to deal with people , learning how to solve conflicts , learning how to solve problems ... the biggest thing is learning how to be successful and that what they do matters			0
" the robotics competition -- called @entity234 : for @entity234 -- was designed to get high school students interested in math and science careers			0
the @entity115 ranks 27th among developed nations in the proportion of college students receiving undergraduate degrees in science or engineering			0
@entity5 does n't need convincing			1
she believes hard work in math and science classes will get her where she needs to go			0
" i 'm competing with the rest of the world and the rest of the world is n't sleeping , is n't eating , is just going that much farther to succeed			2
and to be at their level , i have to be better than them			0
i have to try that much harder			0
" " they want to be successful , " @entity75 says of @entity5 and her teammates			1
" once they find out that they 're the only person that will limit what they can do , and they decide they want to do something , they 're going to go for it			0
" he says @entity5 learned that lesson quickly , in her freshman year			1
" and she grabbed on with both hands and she 's making the most of it , " he says			0
" i want to shoot for the moon , " @entity5 says repeatedly			1
it 's become her mantra			0
" in case you miss you always hit a star			0
" so far , so good			0
she got an a on the math final she took the day we were with her			0
it 's one of many she is piling up in her quest to gain entry into @entity41			0
but 24 of the 32 original students have dropped the math class , most of them because the material was too advanced			0
her dream after college is actually to aim for the sun. she wants to become a solar engineer , a job that pays about $ 80,000 per year			0
" all the energy the sun gives us in one hour can power the whole @entity298 for a whole entire year			0
" she wants to figure out how to control all that power			0
" we need to find a way , " she says confidently			0
@entity5 is reaching toward the sky , a big stretch for a young girl growing up in poverty in @entity0			1
@entity5 's father , @entity305 , came to the @entity115 in the 1960s with a sixth grade education			1
he used to work in restaurants , but now they live off his @entity311 checks			0
@entity305 says he does n't know how to help her with college -- these are just things he does n't understand , and knows he ca n't afford			2
during a walk with @entity5 's father i ask him if he is proud of @entity5 and her ambitions			1
very proud , " he confides			0
and when i ask if he believes she can get into @entity41 he says , " i know she can do it			0
" the conversation is quick			0
his answers are short , but to @entity5 they are long on meaning			1
it 's something he 's never said to her directly			0
" it 's nice , " she says with a smile			0
