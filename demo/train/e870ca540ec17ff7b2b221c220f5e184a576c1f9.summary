two days after announcing she was ending her successful three - year partnership with @entity5 , @entity2 said former great @entity6 will be @entity5 's successor			1
" i have known @entity6 for many years and we briefly worked together in 2008 just before the @entity9 , " @entity2 told her website			1
" i am really excited about our new partnership and looking forward to the upcoming tournaments			0
" the coaching shuffle comes about two weeks after the @entity14 - based @entity13 was upset by qualifier @entity15 in the second round at @entity18			1
" due to personal issues , ( @entity5 ) was not able to travel in the near future and we both agreed it was the right time to move our separate ways , " the world @entity19 had said			2
" i am very thankful for all his work and wish him much success in the future			0
" @entity6 won eight grand slam titles			1

@entity6 ' backhand is regarded as one of the best ever			2
when his playing days were over , @entity6 kept a relatively low profile and mostly stayed away from tennis circles			2

she lost to @entity52 in the final of this year 's @entity48			0
@entity2 's movement noticeably improved under @entity5 -- adding to her fierce ground strokes and intense desire to win			1
but their last tournament together did n't go as planned , with @entity2 slipping twice on the grass at @entity18 against @entity15 and suffering her earliest grand slam exit in three years			1
the loss , however , allowed @entity2 to watch the end of boyfriend @entity65 's marathon five - set loss to @entity66			0
@entity5 left @entity67 to work with @entity2 at the end of 2010 , with the @entity70 baseliner then reaching the final at the @entity9 while @entity2 crashed out in the fourth round			1
