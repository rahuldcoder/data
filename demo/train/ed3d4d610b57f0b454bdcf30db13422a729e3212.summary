-- at the end of july , the @entity2 intelligence committee marked up legislation drafted in response to recent high - profile leaks of classified information			1
the committee 's chairwoman , @entity8 , claims that the bill will address the " culture of leaks " in @entity11			2
but the leaks are a symptom of the intelligence community 's culture of secrecy -- and the bill would make that problem worse in a host of ways			1
any insider will tell you that the government classifies far too much information			0
top military and national security officials estimate that between 50 % and 90 % of classified documents could safely be released			1
that adds up to a massive amount of unnecessary secrecy when one considers there were 92 million decisions to classify information in 2011 alone			0
the @entity37 disclosures featured some vivid examples , such as a cable from an @entity41 diplomat who classified his description of a typical wedding in the province of @entity45			0
the impetus for the current @entity2 bill -- a series of leaks of classified information that may have been implicitly or explicitly " authorized " by top administration officials -- illustrates the problem			1
high - level intelligence officials are not enemies of the state			1
if they are approving the disclosure of classified information , it 's a pretty safe bet the material did n't require classifying in the first place			1
news : @entity2 moves to crack down on national security leaks take the fact that president @entity65 is personally involved in identifying the targets of drone strikes , as reported by @entity68 , one of the disclosures that prompted congressional action			0
it is virtually impossible to fantasize a scenario in which this information could be used to harm the @entity41			0
@entity75 contributes directly to leaks that threaten national security			0
as @entity83 commented in 1971 , " when everything is classified , then nothing is classified , and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless , and to be manipulated by those intent on self - protection or self - promotion			0
" put simply , officials who routinely see innocuous documents stamped " @entity89 " lose respect for the system , and that puts all secrets , the real ones as well as the purely nominal ones , at risk			0
excessive classification also means that even low - level or nonsensitive government positions often require clearances			0
one in every 50 @entity41 adults now has access to classified information , not a winning formula for keeping secrets			1
the @entity2 bill , however , does nothing serious to address the problem of overclassification			1
indeed , it perpetuates the fiction that all classified information poses a dire threat			2
the bill strips intelligence community employees of their pensions if the director of national intelligence decides they leaked classified information , even if the information reveals only that @entity120 weddings last three days			1
it revokes the clearances of officials who disclose the existence of classified covert operations -- even if the operations , like the raid on @entity129 's compound , are in the past and could not possibly be jeopardized by disclosure			0
worse , the @entity2 bill extends the shroud of secrecy to encompass even unclassified information			1
intelligence officials already must submit any publications that discuss their work to their agencies for pre-publication review and approval ; under the bill , they must submit " anticipated oral remarks " as well			1
on its face , the provision could require pre-publication review for dinner party conversations			0
the bill also bars current and recent intelligence officials from contracting with the media to provide commentary on any intelligence or national security matters			1
no member of the intelligence community , for instance , could provide paid commentary on the war in @entity158			2
opinion : @entity65 leak ' scandal ' is wildly overblown most alarming of all , the bill prohibits any intelligence official other than the agency 's director , deputy director or designated public affairs officer from providing off - the - record information " regarding intelligence activities " -- classified or unclassified -- to the media			1
if successful , this provision would ensure that the public hears only the party line on all matters relating to intelligence policy			0
it also would effectively prohibit whistleblowing			2
intelligence officials could raise concerns through approved government channels , but if that failed would have no meaningful way to bring evidence of government fraud , waste , abuse , or illegality to the public 's attention			1
how to deal with disclosures of classified information about government misconduct is a tricky question			2
how to deal with disclosures of unclassified information about government misconduct should be a no - brainer			0
such disclosures should be welcomed and encouraged			0
the law already falls short in this regard : the @entity201 protects other government employees against retaliation for whistle - blowing , but excludes members of the intelligence community			1
the @entity2 bill would turn this lack of protection into a virtual prohibition			2
unauthorized leaks of properly classified information are a real problem			2
grandstanding about authorized leaks of improperly classified information will not solve this problem , nor will cracking down on disclosures of unclassified information			2
if @entity218 wants to get serious about leaks , it will take steps to shrink the universe of secret government information , not expand it to encompass yet more information the public has every right to know			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0

@entity228 : leaks are a symptom of the intelligence community 's culture of secrecy
between 50 % and 90 % of classified documents could safely be released , says @entity228
one in every 50 @entity41 adults now has access to classified information , she says
@entity228 : @entity2 bill would effectively prohibit whistle - blowing for intelligence officials
