the @entity1 's annual spring - summer " dead zone " is the size of @entity4 -- slightly smaller now than in recent years but nowhere near the trim scientists had sought , researchers said this week			1
scientists ' annual survey found an area of 5,052 square miles of " low oxygen water , " or hypoxia , off much of @entity12 's coast and part of @entity14 , the @entity15 said monday			2
the zone is formed by nutrients that wash into the @entity1 's waters -- largely agriculture fertilizer and wastewater coming down the @entity21			2
these boost algae blooms that suck up the oxygen in deep water , according to @entity15 and the @entity26			1
@entity28 life struggles to find enough oxygen to survive within the zone			0
fish and shrimp can migrate to areas with oxygen - rich water , but some life forms in the deep water and ocean floor -- including those that serve as food for the fish and shrimp -- ca n't get out of the zone and eventually die			0
that hurts biodiversity and makes food hard to come by for the fish and shrimp when they return , said the survey 's leader , @entity48 , executive director of the @entity50			0
scientists first discovered a dead zone in these waters in 1972 , and it has appeared ever spring and summer since , with varying sizes			1
this year 's dead zone , measured from july 27 to august 2 , is smaller than the five - year average of 5,550 square miles , and well under 2002 's record 8,481 square miles			1
but scientists had set a goal of reducing the zone to 1,900 square miles by 2015 -- and this year 's measurement likely means that target wo n't be met , @entity48 said			0
" the average we 're targeting against is three times the goal			0
... there has n't been any progress in reaching that goal , " she said			0
ways to shrink the zone , she said , would include changing agricultural practices , including the timing of fertilization -- ideas that have worked well on the small scale but not , so far , on the large			0
there 's been no evidence to show that the @entity1 oil spill of 2010 had any contribution to that year 's dead zone or any subsequent one , @entity48 said			1
the survey is supported by @entity15 and the @entity82			0
the @entity1 dead zone is the world 's second - largest caused by humans , @entity48 said			1
the largest is in the @entity86			0
" the number of dead zones throughout the world has been increasing in the last several decades and currently totals over 550 , " @entity48 said			2
dead zones amount to an expensive hit for @entity93 's fishing industry			1
@entity15 estimates the annual cost of algae blooms to @entity93 seafood and tourism industries at $ 82 million or more			1
can oxygen pump breathe life into ocean ' dead zone ? '			2

the @entity1 " dead zone " is caused by an algae blooms that suck up oxygen
scientists first discovered a dead zone in the @entity1 in 1972
the number of dead zones across the globe is growing
they cost @entity93 seafood and tourism industries $ 82 million a year , @entity15 estimates
