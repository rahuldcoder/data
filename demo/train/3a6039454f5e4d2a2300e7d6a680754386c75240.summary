about 150 personnel , including 80 @entity10 , were evacuated early saturday and were driven across the border into @entity12 , @entity2 officials confirm to @entity13			1
@entity2 officials stress operations have been " temporarily suspended " until " the security situation on the ground improves			2
" the embassy will continue to operate from other locations			1
a senior @entity0 official said some of the staff will be sent to other @entity2 embassies in the region and others will return to @entity25			2
@entity13 has learned the decision to carry out the evacuation was made just in the last few days as the security situation around the embassy deteriorated			1

" securing our facilities and ensuring the safety of our personnel are top @entity0 priorities , and we did not make this decision lightly			2
security has to come first			0
regrettably , we had to take this step because the location of our embassy is in very close proximity to intense fighting and ongoing violence between armed @entity3 factions			1
" militia fighting in the area of the embassy and airport has degraded security in @entity7 significantly			1
eyewitnesses in @entity7 told @entity13 's @entity74 that in the early hours of saturday there was " a lot of movement with fighter jets and helicopters			1
" the @entity3 government was informed of the evacuation after it was carried out , according to @entity2 officials			2

@entity13 has learned there were two f - 16s on combat air patrol overhead , a drone tracking the convoy to the border and a @entity101 destroyer offshore in the @entity102			1
there were also several dozen heavily armed @entity10 flying overhead on @entity106 aircraft in an " airborne response force " that were prepared to land and rapidly evacuate the @entity2 during the transit to the @entity12 border if they came under attack			1
the @entity86 had pressed for weeks to evacuate the embassy , especially after the @entity7 airport came under repeated militia attack , leaving @entity2 no way to get out via commercial air , the official said			1
the decision to use vehicles to drive the @entity2 across the border was seen as the best low - profile approach to conducting the evacuation rather than sending @entity2 military helicopters and troops into @entity7			1
@entity40 said the @entity2 will work with @entity3 and the international community " to seek a peaceful resolution to the current conflict and to advance @entity3 's democratic transition			0
" " we reiterate that @entity3 must immediately cease hostilities and begin negotiations to resolve their grievances			0
we join the international community in calling on all @entity3 to respect the will of the people , including the authority of the recently - elected @entity135 , and to reject the use of violence to affect political processes			2
many brave @entity3 sacrificed to advance their country toward a more secure and prosperous future			0
we continue to stand solidly by the @entity3 people as they endeavor to do so , " @entity40 said			0

" @entity142 added that due to the " freewheeling militia violence that is taking place in @entity7 " the @entity2 along with other countries , one of them @entity146 have decided to " suspended our current diplomatic activities at the @entity1			2
" tensions escalate the @entity158 and other international organizations and businesses temporarily evacuated staff from @entity3 earlier this month			0
nearly three years after the revolution and @entity165 military intervention that overthrew the regime of @entity167 , central government has been outgunned by increasingly powerful militias			0
the civil war has given way to warring militias fighting over @entity7 's international airport			1
the @entity0 " recommends that @entity2 citizens currently in @entity3 depart immediately " in a travel warning issued on saturday			0
this comes nearly two years after attacks on @entity2 government facilities in the @entity3 city of @entity179			0
the assaults of september 11 - 12 , 2012 , left four @entity2 dead , including @entity2 ambassador @entity181 , and spawned political controversy in @entity25			2
@entity184 lawmakers have claimed the @entity32 administration tried to mislead the public about the cause of the attacks and should have done more to prevent them			0
@entity184 critics say they plan to make @entity179 an issue for former secretary of state @entity190 , under whose watch the attacks occurred , should she decide to run for president			0
how did this happen ? @entity194 , @entity193 , @entity195 and @entity3 all in flames opinion : why the @entity199 's borders will never be the same again			0
