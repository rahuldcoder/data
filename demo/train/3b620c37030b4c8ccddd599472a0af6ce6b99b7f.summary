in the movie " @entity2 , " @entity0 plays @entity4 , a man who listens to a voice inside his head			0
the voice tells @entity4 to plow under his sole source of income -- his @entity10 cornfield -- and build a baseball diamond for the ghosts of long dead @entity14 stars to come play in			0
the voice in his head says do n't test out the idea , do n't talk to anyone to see if it 'll work , just build it , and they will come			0
@entity4 builds the field , the ghosts of the players arrive , and he 's vindicated			0
that 's how it works in the movies			0
in reality , of course , it does n't work that way			0
just because you can build something does n't mean you should			0
even if you cook up something cool and new and make it available , real people may still not want it			0
@entity38 seems to have stumbled on that simple fact last week			1
the tech world was surprised by an announcement that on january 19 , @entity42 will be withdrawn from the marketplace			1
sales did n't catch fire			0
apparently , people did n't have much use for it			0
@entity38 may have needed to stop and listen to the needs and emotions of people in the everyday world of consumers			1
good things certainly flowed from @entity42			1
a mainstream conversation started about wearable tech , taking it out of the lab and thrusting it into the clutches of consumers			0
by pushing its agenda into this area , @entity38 will help open the floodgates of products that deliver the promise of the @entity67			1
@entity42 is a demonstration of what gives @entity70 business an edge			1
this kind of applied technology , that creates leaps into a whole new category of products and economic territory , is the essence of @entity70 competitiveness			0
but @entity38 's fast retreat exposes the most fundamental sin that companies make with the " build it and they will come " approach			1
it 's a process that tech companies rely on , referred to as public beta testing			2
but , in one sense , it treats consumers like guinea pigs : a company such as @entity38 invents a test product such as @entity42 , throws it into the marketplace and asks people to actually pay ( in @entity42 ' case : $ 1,500 ) for the privilege of beta testing their unfinished brainstorm			1
companies are so focused on the mousetrap , like @entity42 , they tend to lose touch with the emotions and needs of the people they actually work for : consumers			1
@entity108 , head of @entity42 development at @entity111 research labs , admitted as much			1
the team looked inside @entity38 to the technology they could produce , to make @entity42 , and they did n't fully understand what value @entity42 would play in people 's lives			1
there are other clues that @entity38 had little advance interest in their consumers ' real feelings about the value of smart eyeglass technology			1
before launch , @entity38 did n't anticipate that few would want to pay ( or could afford ) $ 1,500 to parade in public with a device slung around their eyes that others might perceive as either a threat to others ' privacy or a pretentious geeky gadget			1
@entity38 designated early adopters as " explorers , " but the outside world did n't quite see them that way			1
" @entity141 " was the word people invented to describe @entity42 wearers			2
they were thrown out of bars and banned from movie theaters because of privacy and intellectual property concerns			0
@entity42 showed , yet again , that @entity148 's idea of fashion has precious little to do with the tastes of the rest of the world			2
@entity38 execs were taken aback : they 'd never anticipated rejection			2
@entity159 , a key exec on the @entity42 team , was shocked by the @entity162 label and surprised that for his officemates , wife and family , " it was much less desirable for me to wear it than i initially thought			2
" is that tone deaf ? maybe			0
but more than anything , @entity38 spent its time looking inward , at how to make a product that would fit their business agenda of capturing more personal data , rather than looking outward			2
that was a critical mistake			0
feelings and emotions that consumers bring to a product are the pistons of the consumer demand engine -- the " demand drivers " of why someone wants a product to begin with			0
those drivers were there to be discovered and applied to the @entity42 product development process -- and none of those are connected to the company 's ultimate goal of having people hand over yet more data to @entity38			1
@entity193 , for example , is known as a big issue in wearable tech. consumer confidence in the security of digital channels is low			0
there is not one mode through which a majority of @entity70 are " very secure " sharing private information			0
how @entity38 protects information through product design helps determine whether a person will be interested in buying their product			2
@entity38 , more than any company , is familiar with this tricky relationship between technology and privacy			2
yet it designed a product that raised but did n't acknowledge and address these concerns			0
@entity38 seems to have also missed that fashion is personal -- and that is no less true in wearable tech. any wearable tech that typecasts the wearer or , worse , threatens others -- as @entity42 did -- is likely to find limited demand			1
@entity38 is moving to fix the basic issues that dogged @entity42 by making product improvements , utilizing eyewear expertise , including a leader with fashion experience , and taking advantage of a big gun for strategic guidance -- @entity228 -- who brought the @entity229 and @entity230 to market			1
we 'll find out if the new team grasps the core reason @entity42 failed : the company was n't accountable to its consumers			2
one can hope that in the next @entity42 round , and for other @entity38 " moon shots " still incubating in the @entity111 ( driverless cars , wifi balloons and glucose - sensitive contact lenses to name a few ) , the company 's engineers will gaze outside their lab to build a field of dreams for the people intended to play there .			1

@entity38 is pulling *controversial* @entity42 from the marketplace , *rethinking* it
@entity253 : it was a mistake to put it in the market without more thorough testing
