@entity0 -- @entity3 negotiators put forward proposals on security and borders during talks with @entity10 representatives in @entity11 , @entity3 media reported tuesday			1
@entity10 's special envoy , attorney @entity13 , and chief @entity3 negotiator @entity12 met in @entity15 with representatives of the @entity17 -- made up of the @entity18 , the @entity19 , the @entity20 and @entity21 -- in an effort to relaunch negotiations after more than a year of deadlock			1
@entity11 foreign minister @entity25 told reporters that " serious and constructive talks " had taken place , the official @entity29 news agency @entity28 said			2
he said the talks focused on the two - state solution , according to the @entity11 state news agency @entity33			2
the @entity10 said they would consider the @entity3 proposals , and the two sides agreed to meet again in @entity11 , the agency cited @entity25 as saying			1
however , no significant breakthrough was made , @entity25 acknowledged			0
" the gap is wide between the two sides on all issues , " he is quoted as saying by @entity28			0
" the issues are complicated and we do not expect to resolve them in a day or two			0
" @entity33 quoted @entity25 as saying , " we do n't want to raise the expectations about this meeting and we do n't want to underestimate its importance in the same time			0
" peace talks between @entity10 and the @entity3 fell apart more than a year ago over disagreements on the issue of @entity10 settlements in the @entity52			1
in september , @entity29 president @entity53 made a bid for the @entity20 to recognize a @entity3 state , a move @entity10 called premature without direct talks to address its long - standing security concerns			2
filling the vacuum created by the removal of @entity63 's former president @entity62 , @entity11 's @entity59 has taken a more active role in trying to bridge the gulf between @entity10 and @entity3			1
in november , @entity59 made a rare visit to the @entity3 political capital of @entity68 in the @entity52 , followed by a meeting in @entity15 a week later with @entity10 president @entity70			1
the @entity18 has voiced its support for the new initiative			0
" we are hopeful that this direct exchange can help move us forward on the pathway proposed by the quartet , " @entity73 , the @entity18 secretary of state , said sunday night in a statement			0
" the status quo is not sustainable and the parties must act boldly to advance the cause of peace			0
" but while both sides thanked the @entity11 government for its role in bringing about the meeting , few expected any serious breakthroughs			2
speaking to @entity89 beforehand , @entity12 said the meeting would not constitute the resumption of negotiations , but rather would be one that could lead to the restarting of talks			0
former quartet participant and @entity18 diplomat @entity98 wrote sunday for the @entity100 that , while the resumption of contacts between the two sides would be a positive development , it " inadvertently makes the situation on the ground riskier			0
" " @entity53 is returning to talks without attaining his long - standing demand that negotiations resume with an @entity10 settlement freeze , " @entity98 wrote			2
" unless he can demonstrate quickly that talks produce tangible benefits for the @entity3 , he will feel compelled to break them off			0
" this , @entity98 said , could add impetus to @entity53 concluding ongoing talks with @entity115 about forming a @entity3 unity government -- an idea vehemently opposed by representatives of @entity10 and the @entity18 , who consider the @entity121 group a terrorist organization			1
@entity122 , a spokesman for @entity115 , said monday he was surprised by the meetings			2
he said @entity115 considered them a repetition of a failed initiative and called on the @entity29 to cancel the meeting tuesday with @entity10 representatives			1
@entity115 spokesman @entity128 told @entity1 that the meeting of the @entity3 with the @entity10 occupying forces " is a mockery			1
" @entity10 government spokesman @entity132 told @entity1 last week that " if @entity53 walks toward @entity115 , he is walking away from peace			1
" @entity1 's @entity134 contributed to this report .			0
