@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has swept to power with the aim of imposing a strict @entity7 ideology on @entity8 across large swathes of @entity8 's rebel - held north , according to a @entity2 survey of towns , activists and analysts that reveals an alarming increase in @entity3 - linked control in just the past month			1
@entity3 - backed militants known as the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) are the predominant military force in northern @entity8 , according to activists and seasoned observers , and have a powerful influence over the majority of population centers in the rebel - held north			1
@entity27 , from the @entity28 , said : " @entity19 is the strongest group in @entity8 -- 100 % -- and anyone who tells you anything else is lying			1
" @entity2 conducted dozens of interviews with activists , local and international observers and residents of the towns affected by @entity19 in preparing this study			2
many of the @entity8 @entity2 spoke to talked anonymously for fear of angering @entity19 , saying @entity19 has in some areas made it a crime punishable by flogging to even say their name			1
the swift @entity3 expansion poses a severe policy dilemma for the @entity46 and its @entity48 allies who have long delayed their promised armed assistance to rebel groups as they struggled with fears that the weapons could end up in the hands of @entity3 - backed extremists			1
observers say the delay has provided a vacuum in the often chaotic rebel ranks that the organized and fearless @entity61 have moved to fill			0
many observers explain that the extent of @entity19 's discipline and resources -- they are said to have considerable cash at their disposal -- means that the other rebel groups operating in the north do not seek to confront them			0

" much of this is a result of its capability to exploit superior levels of financing and resources -- essentially , to spread itself thinly enough to exert influence and / or control , but not too thin as to be overpowered by rivals			0
" most activists point to a clear strategy by @entity19 -- which aims to dominate a large swathe of the north from the north - western town of @entity95 to the north - eastern city of @entity97 and beyond -- of focusing on population centers on the edges of rebel - held territory and slowly choking off central areas			2
some @entity19 figures have described a broader aim of trying to link the @entity106 province of @entity107 in @entity108 to the @entity110 coast , near the @entity8 town of @entity112			2
there are a number of smaller towns in northern @entity8 which -- activists and residents have told us -- are controlled entirely by @entity19 : @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity97 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
the survey has established that @entity19 also has a presence -- which is often hard for other rebel groups to challenge -- in the following towns : @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147			0
watch video : secret jihadi smuggling route through @entity1 while the main city of @entity151 remains in the control of a series of different rebel groups , @entity19 has begun exerting control on key entry points into the city , and has recently gained control of the @entity160 neighborhood			0
the group is also gaining ground in controlling the northern access points to the city and territory in the rebel - held east			0
@entity19 ' control around @entity95 , another key city , is complicated by the regime 's continued presence there , but the group has established a foothold to the north east in @entity132 , is present in the town of @entity146 , and is in full control of @entity124 , a key town to @entity95 's north			0
their grip over the rebel town of @entity97 is considerably tighter than elsewhere , despite the continued presence of rival and even aligned rebel groups who do not seek to challenge them			0
the @entity186 think - tank says @entity19 ' grip on @entity97 makes it " the largest city @entity3 has ever controlled in the @entity19 world			1
" @entity2 @entity3 expert @entity190 said the @entity186 assessment could be correct , given the nature of @entity19 's dominance in @entity97 , but pointed out that the @entity194 admitted @entity3 was in control of the @entity108 province of @entity107 in 2006 , which contained , at the time , around a couple of million people , and so could technically be considered larger			1
in these @entity19 - held areas , signs of the kind of @entity7 society that the @entity3 - backed militants seek to create have been swift to emerge ; one woman activist drew comparisons with the @entity207 's rule over @entity208			1
rulings have been posted in some towns forbidding women to travel without a male relative and at certain times of the day , ordering them to cover up their hair with the traditional @entity19 headscarf and not to wear trousers in public , and banning them from wearing make - up and seeking treatment from male doctors			2
smoking and cameras have also been banned			0
watch video : @entity3 's growing influence in @entity8 on sunday one northern town , @entity126 , saw a poster erected by @entity19 threatening thieves with having their hand cut off -- an extreme form of punishment mandated by radical readings of @entity7 , or @entity232 , law			1
while many @entity8 have described the initial approach of @entity19 towards towns they seek to control as friendly and peaceful , often offering generous cash incentives to cooperate , they are increasingly brutal in dealing with their critics			1
one activist described how he was taken by @entity19 militants from the town of @entity121 and held in a blanket factory in @entity151 's northern suburb of @entity243			2
" i was tortured , beaten			0
they hung me from the ceiling and used electricity on me			0
they kept trying to make me confess being a @entity249 spy , " he said , adding that the factory held 20 other prisoners , mostly from rival rebel brigades , and that the site was also used by @entity19 to make bombs			0
@entity19 have released a series of slickly - produced videos about their growing control , and some skeptics say they are promoting stories of their dominance to increase their power over local populations			2
yet in recent weeks , many activists accept that @entity19 ' genuine hold on the rebel north has escalated to the point where rival groups are unable to challenge them .			0
