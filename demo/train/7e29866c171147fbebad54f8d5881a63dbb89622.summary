-- cycling superstar @entity1 will be riding for a new team next year after the collapse of @entity4 , but gave no clues friday to his eventual destination			1
the sprinter took his tally of @entity10 stage victories to 20 with five wins on this year 's race amid continued speculation he was going to jump ship to @entity16 - based @entity15			0
he said this week that he would make public his decision within a month , but then @entity4 owner @entity18 announced thursday that the team would fold because they could not find a sponsor for 2012			2
@entity1 , who has been with the team for five years , was quick to pay tribute to them on his personal website			2
" i am obviously very disappointed that @entity4 will no longer be a team at the end of this season , " he said			2
" i am hugely indebted and incredibly grateful to my teammates and all the staff for their support over the last five years and i am immensely proud of what we have achieved together			0
" but the @entity32 , who claimed the green jersey for the first time in this year 's @entity10 , would still not reveal where he was headed			0
" a number of teams have expressed interest in me riding for them in 2012 , " he added			0
" i have now made a decision i am happy with and will be in a position to discuss my intentions once everything has been finalized			0
" @entity15 , who boast his fellow @entity16 @entity46 teammates @entity47 and @entity48 , remain the favorites to get his coveted signature , but @entity1 has also been linked with new @entity52 team @entity51			1
they announced friday the signing of world pursuit record holder @entity54 and brothers @entity56 and @entity58 , three of the most promising riders in cycling as they add to their 2012 roster			1
but they will do well to match the achievements of the soon to be defunct @entity4 , who have been the most successful team in the professional peloton with their men 's and women 's teams achieving nearly 500 victories over five years .			1
