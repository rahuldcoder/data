@entity0 -- jazz master @entity2 says the blues is the true @entity5 music -- the heartbeat and unifying principle of jazz , country , r&b , gospel and other styles -- but it 's been relegated to the back of the bus by greed and the legacy of racism			1
@entity2 grew up in @entity18 , @entity19 , son of @entity21 and @entity22			1
he was a trumpet prodigy , surrounded by top - notch musicians and steeped in the city 's eclectic music			1
he was encouraged to excel by his father , a jazz pianist who instilled in his son a love of musical excellence and integrity			0
@entity2 plays classical and jazz music with equal mastery			1
he is artistic director of @entity33 at @entity34 and has won nine @entity35 and the @entity36 in music			2
he will be awarded the @entity38 on november 6			0
in an interview tuesday , @entity2 talked to @entity1 about the primary position of the blues in @entity5 music			1
the blues is our root music , @entity5 born - and - bred , but it 's been treated like a stepchild of dubious origin , granted only secondary status , in @entity2 ' view			1
it suffuses @entity51 , @entity52 , rock ' n ' roll , country - western , gospel , bluegrass and more , but never got its financial due or the respect it deserves			2
@entity2 says that 's because of racism -- it was the music of a whole people granted only secondary status -- and its inability to make a lot of money			1
he also talks about his father , how slavery has affected the nation , and some lessons to be learned from jazz			2
@entity1 : you have a dvd out called " @entity74 and @entity2 play the music of @entity76			1
" that 's jazz , country and @entity80			2
what do those styles have in common ? wynton marsalis : the blues			2
it runs through all @entity5 music			1
the other is the two - beat groove			0
it 's in @entity18 music , it 's in jazz , it 's in country music , it 's in gospel			1
the other is the down - home sensibility that 's sophisticated			2
that 's why @entity98 could play with @entity99			2
@entity76 is actually the embodiment			0
he and @entity74 came ' round in young manhood at a time in the late ' 40s early 1950s when all of the @entity5 music , root music , was all combined			1
it became segregated in the mid- to late - ' 50s			0
@entity108 had a hit in 1955 -- " @entity110			0
" it was on the r&b charts , it was on the country charts , it was no. 1 on the rock and roll charts			0
[ it was ] basically the same music , so there was an intersection point			2
it 's like in cuisine , that would be like fried chicken and red beans and rice , it would be like potato salad and barbecued ribs			2
someone in @entity131 not going to eat barbecued ribs ? @entity1 : what led to the compartmentalization of these kinds of music , that came from the same roots ? @entity139 : money and racism			1
i do n't know which one came first			2
@entity1 : why was blues not regarded as something of value in this country ? @entity139 : it came from who we did n't like			1
that 's what it was -- it was n't that we could n't see it			1
who it came from , we did not like them			0
@entity1 : so do you include african - americans in that ? so black people did n't appreciate it ? @entity139 : they did n't appreciate it			2
that 's part of the whole kind of self - hatred that comes from that type of slavery that the black @entity5 still labors under			1
the legacy of it -- it was n't just 50 years			1
it was seven generations , and if a generation is 33 years , ... seven or eight [ generations ]			2
that 's a long time			2
and to recover from it has proven to be very difficult			0
@entity1 : so is that what 's going on with rap ? @entity139 : no question			2
rap is the repetition of the minstrel show			0
but it 's not going to go away , it was too many people			2
if it had been 100,000 people , it can go away			0
... but it ca n't be millions of people and their descendants			2
[ @entity196 ] was a very powerful and successful system			0
and it went on for a long time			0
in the aftermath of slavery ... there was a retrenching , and [ it turned into ] the type of racism that was experienced by people who came to the @entity206			1
that consciousness has begun to shift , in the last 30 years			1
and that 's 20 or 30 years of just thawing and shifting that 's attached to 330 years [ of slavery ] , and the thought you can get up and you will be better ... that 's just asinine , it 's absurd			1
@entity1 : but did n't the blues come from this , being marginalized ? @entity139 : the blues was like a solution to that , an antidote to it			1
but the blues is not only @entity222			2
@entity1 : so , you 've written that it 's not just @entity224 , it 's @entity5			1
what about @entity5 gave rise to the blues ? @entity139 : it is @entity5			1
it 's that combination , those tensions , the east - west tensions , the kind of tension of being a slave in the land of freedom , and the land of freedom itself , the @entity246 mind , the concept of soloing across time , the call - and - response of democracy , direct call and response , the kind of optimism that is @entity5 in nature , is in the blues			1
there are elements in it that are @entity224 and there are elements of the @entity5 take on @entity258			1
it 's integrated , it 's like a person whose dna is integrated			0
you start to try to figure it out -- but you ca n't			0
that 's how the blues is , that 's why it fits with everything , country - western , bluegrass -- everybody 's playing the same music			1
@entity1 : you write that jazz leaves room for individual creativity , but you have to listen and allow the other musicians to participate equally			0
so what 's the lesson for the nation ? @entity139 : we have to have an overall cultural objective , which we do n't have			1
... we then fight under the flag of a position , the left or the right , black or white , old or young			0
we do n't know our cultural history , we do n't know we are together , and because we do n't know we are together we ca n't act in that way			1
and that 's the main thing our music , and the history of our music , can teach us as a nation			1
the one concept that has to be at the heart of the @entity5 experiment is integrity			1
the integrity of the process is very important			0
if you come up on the bandstand you have to be at least trying to swing			0
if you do n't really want to swing or play with the musicians , there 's nothing they can do , because you have the freedom to destroy it			1
@entity1 : your father set an example			0
it sounds like you got a lot of your ideas about integrity from him			0
@entity139 : yes , he sure did			0
he was n't segregated about any music , he did n't care , you could play pop music , funk , he 'd say " right , great man			1
" he was a jazz musician			0
he was n't uptight and always railing about somebody			0
what he did was very clear , and what he thought about being a man , he did n't look at a boy like that			0
i remember he sat in with our funk band one time			0
... we 'd go to his gig , there 'd be six people			0
we 'd go to our gig , there 'd be thousands of people , dancing having a good time			0
we were playing a dance at a high school , he did n't know any of the music , but he played all of the music we had			1
we were laughing , we said , my daddy did n't know any of the music and he did n't know any of the tunes but he was playing better than us			1
@entity1 : when you were playing in a funk band in high school , did you look at your jazz musician dad as old school ? @entity139 : no , no , never , i never suffered from that misconception , because he was so much hipper than the people i was around			0
philosophically , he knew more than we did			0
i 'd bring people to see him			0
he never tried to act like a child , like a kid			0
i never thought i knew more than him , he was on the case			0
@entity1 : what are the components of jazz ? @entity139 : the main three components are the blues , improvisation -- which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up -- and swing , which means even though they 're making up music , they 're trying to make it up together			1
it feels great , like you 're having a great conversation with somebody			0
sometimes you get in a good coordinated groove , and it just continues to happen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : the blues is at the root of all @entity5 music , but was never given its due
@entity2 : blues *unappreciated* by blacks and whites alike , due to racism and money
slavery was 330 years , shift away from racism 's *effects* only in past 30 years
he says @entity5 do n't know their cultural history : there are solutions to divisions
