@entity0 wins again ! @entity5 's " @entity4 , " a technologically enhanced re-release of the 1994 animated classic , tore up the competition at the box office this weekend , earning an estimated $ 29.3 million -- more than the other three newcomers combined			1
in " @entity4 's " original theatrical run , it roared up a stunning $ 312.9 million total , becoming the highest - grossing animated film in box office history at that time			1
the film earned another $ 15.7 million during a 2002 @entity15 re-release , and now another $ 29.3 million during the first weekend of its two - week run			1
all told , @entity17 and company have grossed $ 357.8 million in theaters domestically over the last two decades			1
and then there 's the home market , where @entity5 is hoping buyers will seek out " @entity4 " on @entity23 when it debuts on oct. 4			2
according to @entity24 , " @entity4 " has amassed $ 1.5 billion in home market revenue from video sales and rentals , and after the profitable publicity of this weekend , that number should be moving up shortly			1
" the @entity41 " converted " @entity4 " into @entity30 for a very low cost ( a rep for the studio said " the low single digits " ) , so even if the film completely bombs on dvd -- which it wo n't -- it 's already proving to be a big success			2
an impressive 92 percent of " @entity4 's " gross came from @entity30 screens , and it earned a terrific $ 12,575 per theater average by playing to a very wide range of moviegoers			1
people under the age of 25 made up 59 percent of the audience , as families ( who made up 74 percent of the audience ) took their kids to see the film			2
still , many couples and young people without children saw the film simply for nostalgic reasons			0
women slightly edged out men in rewatching the popular musical -- females made up 56 percent of the crowd			0
but enough about lions -- let 's get to the rest of the chart ! last weekend 's champ , " contagion , " came in second place , declining just 35 percent to $ 14.5 million and lifting its total to $ 44.2 million			1
the well - reviewed illness thriller remained a top choice for adult audiences on a weekend when " @entity77 , " " drive , " and " @entity78 " were all targeting them as well			0
if the @entity81 picture can maintain soft week - to - week drops , it will have no trouble earning back its $ 60 million budget			2
@entity86 's artsy thriller " drive " raced into third place with $ 11 million			1
the r - rated @entity90 production , directed by @entity91 , played mostly to an older crowd , as 75 percent of the audience was 25 or older			0
unfortunately , not everyone who saw the film liked it â€” despite strong critical reviews , audiences issued " drive " a harsh " c -- " @entity102 grade , which does not bode well for its box - office longevity			0
hopefully this is not a sign of things to come to @entity108 collaborations			0
the film earned a fair $ 3,818 per theater average			2
in fourth place was @entity5 's stalwart august release " the help , " which continued to work up solid numbers in its sixth weekend			0
the @entity117 adaptation fell by 28 percent to $ 6.4 million , and it has now earned $ 147.4 million against its $ 25 million budget			1
if only the films in fifth and sixth place were so lucky ... " @entity77 " debuted in fifth place with a very weak $ 5 million			1
the @entity122 remake ( of @entity124 's 1971 film with @entity125 ) , which played mostly to males ( 60 percent ) and older audiences ( 61 percent at least 25 years - old ) has already exhibited major frontloadedness , earning $ 2 million on friday but only 2.5 times that over the full frame			1
with a " c " cinemascore grade , " @entity77 " will be lucky to break $ 10 million total			2
next up was @entity134 's rom - com " @entity78 , " which i can only imagine is a two - hour clip of @entity137 wondering how she ( obviously , @entity138 ) , actually does it ( makes money at the box office )			0
the @entity142 production , produced for about $ 20 - 25 million , earned just $ 4.5 million over the friday - to - sunday period , failing even to live up to @entity137 's 2009 box - office bomb " @entity145 ? , " which debuted to $ 6.6 million			1
the film was viewed by 74 percent females , and it received a " b -- " @entity102 grade			0
other notable box - office happenings this weekend : " @entity151 " crossed the $ 170 million plateau , " @entity153 " surpassed $ 80 million total , and " @entity155 : @entity159 " earned another $ 1.2 million out of only 230 theaters , lifting its 10 - day total to a remarkable $ 3.6 million			1

contagion -- $ 14.5 mil 3			1
drive -- $ 11.0 mil 4			2
the help -- $ 6.4 mil 5			0
