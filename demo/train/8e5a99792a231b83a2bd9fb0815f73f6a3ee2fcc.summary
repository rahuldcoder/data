-- knowledge is said to be power			1
but as parents living in an information - driven age , we feel compelled to grasp all of the facts that bombard us			1
we are hyperinformed and ultraconscientious			1
we surf the @entity8 , we read the books , we poll our friends			1
yet in accumulating new insights , we are often left feeling confused and uncertain			1
the most vexing parenting decision my husband and i have faced thus far was whether to circumcise our son			1
religious tradition was not a factor for us , as non-jews , so instead we searched our consciences , weighing myriad factors such as aesthetics , tradition , hygiene , future sexual pleasure , and self - esteem -- lofty concepts indeed to contemplate for the unnamed bulge in my tummy , but contemplate them we did			1
this is why one evening , while bathing my 5 - year - old son , i was thrown into a bubbly contemplative haze as he looked down at himself and shouted , " i hate my foreskin ! " this was certainly not a sentence i ever imagined coming out of his mouth , but there it was			1
( and yes , he knows the actual word			1
) he slid the skin on top of his penis to make himself appear circumcised			1
had we made the wrong decision ? some families do to their son whatever was done to the child 's father so father and son will look alike			1
in our case , my husband 's father was not circumcised due to a premature birth , and my husband was			1
my husband never felt particularly disturbed that he and his father were different in that area , so again , we were on our own			2
empowered patient : should teens make own circumcision decision ? our @entity65 pediatrician , for whom we have great respect , dr. @entity67 , had been very neutral on the subject			1
she told us that about half of the boys in her @entity72 practice were circumcised			2
she reiterated the @entity75 statement of 1999 , which states : " existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision ; however , these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision			1
" also worth noting is that not all health insurance companies cover routine circumcision			1
so religiously , cosmetically , and medically , there seemed to be no compelling reason for us to circumcise			2
at that point , i was at a loss -- no , not penis envy , but i had never seen an uncircumcised penis			2
yet to circumcise simply because that was familiar to me seemed unfair to my son			2
my husband , in weighing the arguments , kept coming back to an encounter we had with dr. @entity97 , one of the pediatricians that we had initially interviewed when choosing a doctor years before			2
@entity97 wrote the book , " what your doctor may not tell you about @entity105			2
" he is the country 's leading pediatric advocate for not circumcising			2
his writings stressed the significance of foreskin in sexual pleasure , pointing out that " the foreskin is an organ " that contains " a rich concentration of blood vessels and nerve endings			2
" as i considered that , my mind flashed to my liberal arts college 's @entity119 classes ' literature about female circumcision being used in some countries for the precise reason of decreasing sexual pleasure			1
we would never in a million years consider circumcising a girl , so why should we do so to our son ? we chose not to			2
until the bubble bath incident , i had been comfortable with our decision , even secretly proud of it			1
i had a small moment of panic in 2006 when a @entity134 @entity133 study discussing circumcision as a significant factor in aids prevention in @entity138 was reported in the @entity139			1
i hoped the medical community was n't going to change its mind , as by then my son was already 2 , his foreskin intact			2
when he was 4 , i noticed he very often he retracted his foreskin , and once while so doing said , " look , @entity145 , like @entity146			2
" @entity146 was a circumcised friend whom he had seen while changing clothes			0
i realized that most of the boys my son had seen naked -- cousins and friends at preschool -- looked different			0
most were circumcised , including his father			0
why , i wondered , were all these other boys circumcised ? i decided to informally poll a few moms to find out how they decided			0
@entity158 , in her work as a journalist , had seen an inadequately skilled first - year resident perform the procedure			0
she vowed that should she ever have sons , she would not circumcise			0
years later , her @entity163 husband told her that " he wanted his son to have the chance to be @entity163			0
" @entity158 deferred to that			0
she chose a mohel who had circumcised 10,000 boys to do the procedure			0
yet she said she had to leave the house during the bris			0
@entity158 said when she read about the @entity175 study in 2006 , she was delighted to learn there could be additional public health benefits to circumcision			1
@entity179 told me that she regrets having her son circumcised			0
" it was hard for us to justify doing it other than that it was something that he ( my husband ) and i understood			0
" her son 's circumcision was botched			1
the doctor had trouble with the clamp in the procedure , and , at 3 months old , her son had to have surgery by a urologist in order to be re-circumcised			0
another friend , @entity197 , said , " i always said that the penis was his ( her husband 's ) department			0
he wanted our son to look like him			0
but i am really glad my son was circumcised			0
it is hard enough to get him to wash at all , so if there were one more layer to it , i ca n't imagine			0
" finally , i asked @entity67 again , as i knew she recently had her own son			0
she told me : " i had him circumcised for religious reasons , in a very traditional service			0
i felt very uncomfortable about it , but it was a faith - based decision , not a rational , medical one			1
if it were not part of my faith , i do n't think i would do it			0
" back to the bubble bath : after my son stopped screaming i told him that @entity145 and @entity224 had made the best decision about his body they could , because he was too little to ask			1
" we did n't want them to cut your body when you were a tiny baby , " i explained			0
then , i cringed imagining him at the pool asking some unsuspecting circumcised boy why his parents would let them cut his body when he was a tiny baby			0
confronting our circumcision decision over and over has been humbling			1
my one conclusion : in parenting , and in life , there is never a clear answer			0
most big decisions are based in faith , be it religious faith or faith in ourselves			0
if we have either of those as parents , then no matter which way the trend swings , or what the studies prove over time , we can , at the very least , live with the knowledge that we did what we thought was the best for our children			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			1
