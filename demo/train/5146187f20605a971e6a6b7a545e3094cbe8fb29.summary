editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- before i went to @entity20 , i did n't know much about the conflict in @entity22 beyond everyone saying , " it 's the worst genocide of our time " and watching footage on @entity3 of the @entity26 militia wiping out whole villages			1
really , we only decided to go there because one of our favorite photographers had been chatting with an old friend of his who is now a @entity35 press officer in @entity36			0
she offered to pull some strings and get us visas and organize flights around the country , so we said , " f * * * it " and got on a plane			1
on the flight over , i went through this huge binder of research about the situation			2
it really messed me up			0
the scale of the devastation was difficult to comprehend : there have been 300,000 people killed and at least 2 million displaced from their homes in @entity22 since fighting broke out in 2003			1
this comes right on the heels of another civil war in the south of @entity20 that killed more than 2 million people and displaced a further 4 million over the course of the conflict			1
as the plane landed in @entity36 , i had the biggest " ummmm , what the f * * * am i doing here ? " moment of my life			1
from the minute we got off the plane to the minute we flew out again , i was s * * * - scared			1
and as it turned out , i was totally right to be			0
i never understood the motivation of the conflict until i went there			1
why are they killing all these people , cutting their arms off and throwing them in the wells ? well , obviously that 's a terror tactic , but it also makes the villages and towns where they do it unlivable afterward			2
why ruin the land that you 're raiding ? it did n't seem to be about one group claiming rights to territory ; they 're all @entity90 , so it is n't about religion or @entity93 killing blacks , like it 's being portrayed in the media			0
what is it for ? well , as little as 30 years ago , @entity20 was one of the poorest nations in @entity100			1
it experienced a huge famine in the early 1980s , just like @entity103			0
then they found oil in the south , so they freaked out and sent all these paramilitary groups similar to the @entity26 down there and kicked all the people off the land			0
these groups were not officially affiliated with the government , so the government could safely say , " it 's got nothing to do with us , " but they were all secretly government - sanctioned			1
the civil war that this led to went on for nearly 20 years			0
they finally enacted a peace agreement to unite north and south @entity20 , and the @entity35 went to @entity20 especially to monitor that agreement			2
but then -- bang ! -- same thing happened again , elsewhere in the country			0
the @entity26 started killing people in @entity22 , and the government was saying " it 's not us doing it " and doing very little to stop them			1
see the rest of @entity20 at @entity9 and that 's the interesting thing			1
in fact , we could point our finger at @entity132 for the early days of it , because @entity134 sank the first well in southern @entity20			2
when we went down south in @entity20 and saw the wells , we found out that it 's all @entity138 companies there now			1
@entity138 does n't have any of @entity132 's problems of bad press in the @entity141 or @entity100 , or people back home saying they should n't buy conflict diamonds or whatever			2
@entity138 is in very good favor in those parts of the world			0
in 2009 , @entity138 gave $ 10 billion in aid to @entity100 countries			0
so @entity100 are like , " we love @entity138			0
" in turn , @entity138 comes in and says , " we 'll take your oil and your gold			0
we do n't give a s * * * about your conflicts or who hates who here			1
" the work camps are all completely enclosed and staffed by @entity138 and @entity159			0
all the money that @entity20 gets from these wells goes to the north to @entity36			2
the south of @entity20 is supposed to get 2 percent , but they have no auditing there , so it 's like , " two percent of how much ? " it 's crazy , you 're in the poorest areas in the world , and you 're constantly in the shadow of rigs that are pumping out oil for @entity138			1
everyone likes to say that @entity132 is addicted to oil , but at this point it 's the entire world .			0

@entity9 goes to @entity20 on a quest to learn the motivation behind the @entity22 conflict
research just before the trip opened reporter @entity184 's eyes to scale of devastation
@entity184 : " from the minute we got off the plane to the minute we flew out again , i was s * * * - scared . "
