-- @entity2 's recent cover story featuring @entity3 breastfeeding her almost four - year - old son raised a firestorm about different styles of parenting			1
along with the headline -- " are you mom enough ? " -- the piece makes every mother question whether she should practice attachment parenting and in the process , embrace all things natural			1
wear your baby ! make your own baby food ! breastfeed ! sleep with your baby ! give birth at home -- and do n't use painkillers ! like the white , radiant and married woman on @entity2 's cover , many mothers who embrace natural mothering are likely to be educated , middle class , married , fit and savvy			1
they take motherhood as seriously as they take their education and careers			2
which is not a bad thing			0
the kids will surely benefit			0
but the pressure to be the best mother misses a point : given the realities of the 21st century society , not every woman can be " mom enough			1
" for one thing , breastfeeding is not for all mothers			1
successful breastfeeding -- especially extended breastfeeding -- takes a lot of planning , time off from paid work , money and resources			1
@entity48 , too , decided to breastfeed when i had my first baby			0
everything i read said that breastfeeding was natural , intuitive , cheap and easy			1
but i found breastfeeding painful , time - consuming and difficult			1
and , when you factor in the extra amounts of healthy foods i was consuming ( organic only , of course ) , the money i spent on gadgets and experts , and the house cleaner who allowed me to catch up on my sleep -- it was n't cheap			1
a graduate student in sociology at the time when i had my baby , i interviewed women about breastfeeding			1
most of them shared my experience			0
one woman listed the accessories she invested in : a special " @entity76 " nursing pillow , a rocking chair , nursing bras , a pump , and herbal supplements ( rumored to enhance milk supply )			0
she estimated that by the time she got into a groove she 'd spent close to a thousand dollars			0
and that 's not counting household help			1
another woman told me that for weeks she was fatigued , in pain and dreading every feeding			0
but she was a go - getter			0
the same attitude that got her through an @entity94 phd program and helped her succeed in @entity95 helped her master breastfeeding			1
granted , she saw a lactation consultant twice a week			0
then there was a woman who likened her one - year breastfeeding goal to running a marathon ( she had completed two )			1
she was happy to finally swear off the three daily pumping sessions that allowed her to keep her baby off formula after her maternity leave ended			0
no mother really needs all the paraphernalia and experts in order to breastfeed			0
most of the time , mothers ' breasts produce sufficient milk and babies are adept at getting their food			0
so should n't we know better ? since the early 20th century , women were told that breast milk alternatives were the modern , scientific , superior and @entity121 way to go			2
the result ? by the 1970s fewer than 25 % of @entity121 women even tried to breastfeed and experiential knowledge had been lost			2
this explains why new mothers feel ill - prepared : they ca n't get advice from their mothers , aunts , grandmothers and neighbors			0
the women i interviewed took classes , read books , practiced with dolls , and met with lactation experts			2
breastfeeding advocates raised legitimate concerns about breast milk alternatives ( corn syrups for babies ? ) and many women who decided to breastfeed and practice attachment parenting genuinely believed that going natural was the better route			1
hence , breastfeeding rates have been growing steadily for the last several decades for all groups of women , but especially for those who are white , educated and married			1
however , touting breastfeeding as the way to go defies logic			2
for all of its benefits to infants , breastfeeding on demand 24/7 is challenging when our sleep cycles are regulated by artificial light and we are separated from our baby for hours on end because of our jobs			2
yes , we can use breast pumps to provide babies with breast milk			0
but pumps just are n't as efficient as babies at extracting milk			0
mothers who go back to work find themselves fighting an uphill battle to maintain an adequate milk supply			0
many spend hours a day at the pump before , during and after work			0
the lucky ones have a private space in which to pump and a fridge to store their milk			0
some of the women i talked to were n't so lucky ; they pumped in public bathrooms or cubicles that offered little privacy			2
one woman used a supply closet			0
some mothers may have the financial means to quit their jobs and dedicate themselves to full - time parenting			2
for most women , this is not a viable choice , since the more time they spend away from work , the larger the negative impact on their potential lifetime earnings			2
even for women who aim to be great mothers , breastfeeding is not always a feasible option			1
branding breastfeeding as natural and economical without fully acknowledging the difficulties of balancing family and career creates unnecessary pressure and guilt			1
@entity211 psychologist @entity210 understood this when he set his bar for good parenting			1
rather than challenging women to be " mom enough , " he urged mothers to be " good enough " -- bottles of formula included			1
i was certainly happy to be a good enough mother			2
and by the time my kids hit preschool , nobody really cared whether and how long i had breastfed my children			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity2 published a *controversial* article about attachment parenting
@entity228 : not all women can be ' mom enough ; ' breastfeeding is not for all women
she thought breastfeeding was intuitive and cheap , but found it to be difficult and *expensive*
@entity228 : given the realities of *juggling* career and family , it 's ok to be ' good enough '
