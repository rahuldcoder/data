@entity0 -- a @entity3 high court ruled tuesday that cameras will be allowed in court for part of athlete @entity8 ' trial in the killing of his girlfriend			1
judge @entity11 in @entity12 delivered his ruling -- which will put cameras in a criminal trial for the first time in @entity3 -- in response to several local media broadcasters ' applications to broadcast the trial live			1
@entity8 goes on trial on march 3 , accused of murdering his girlfriend , model and law school graduate @entity24 , just over a year ago			1
the double amputee @entity26 star does not deny killing @entity24 , but he says he mistook her for a home invader when he shot her in the bathroom of his upscale home in @entity31			2
in his ruling , @entity11 said the question of whether the trial should be televised shows the conflict between the right of the accused to a fair trial and the right to freedom of expression for the media and the principle of open justice			2
to balance those interests , the judge said @entity8 and defense witnesses , as well as prosecution witnesses who choose not to give consent , should not be filmed by tv cameras as they testify			1
he also placed some limitations on still photography			0
however , the prosecution and defense opening statements and closing arguments , police evidence and experts ' testimony can be broadcast on tv , @entity11 said , and live audio recording for radio broadcast will be permitted for the whole trial			1
" the justice system is still perceived as treating the rich and famous with kid gloves whilst being harsh on the poor and vulnerable , " the judge said			0
" enabling a larger @entity3 society to follow first - hand the criminal proceedings which involve a celebrity , so to speak , will go a long way into dispelling these negative and unfounded perceptions about the justice system , and will inform and educate society regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings			0
" @entity8 ' legal team had argued that some witnesses would be inhibited and potentially traumatized by intrusive filming as they gave their testimony			1
the legal team for @entity24 's family also said it did not want the trial televised			1
since being freed on bail , @entity8 has remained largely out of the spotlight			0
he released a statement on the anniversary of @entity24 's death , saying he would carry the " complete trauma " of the day forever			2
" no words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love @entity24 , " he said on his website			0
@entity24 's family members , including her mother , have said they will attend the trial			2
it will be the first time they will face their daughter 's boyfriend in court			0
