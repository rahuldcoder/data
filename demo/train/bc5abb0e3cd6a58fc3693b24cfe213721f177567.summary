-- a significant number of investors are preparing to confront the management of @entity4 on thursday by voting against the @entity7 bank 's 2011 pay award and denying executives formal approval of their actions			1
the bank 's share price dropped 28 per cent last year and it lost $ 2.25bn in a rogue trade in @entity14 that caused the largest unauthorised trading loss on record in @entity17			1
for the same period , the bank chose to pay 12 members of its executive board @entity19 ( $ 77.1m ) compared to @entity21 in the year before			0
that has prompted advisory groups and institutional investors including @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 to rebel against what they see as a lack of disclosure on how pay is calculated and a high proportion of variable pay			0
@entity36 , director of corporate governance at @entity38 , which owns a 0.2 per cent stake in the bank , said : " @entity4 's bonus pool for its executive board is still too high given the trading scandal , decreasing profits and a drop in market value in the past year			1
" @entity46 : occupy boardroom : shareholders revolt @entity50 , head of @entity52 corporate governance at @entity28 which represents 25 clients with a combined stake of 0.15 per cent , said it was worried about a lack of specific performance criteria for @entity4 bonuses			0
" without assurances that large discretionary payouts ca n't occur we can not vote in favour of the pay scheme , " she said			0
although the exact voting intentions of shareholders will not be clear until the annual meeting , some investors say they expect the bank to face a more forceful vote than at fellow @entity7 group @entity70 , where more than a third who voted refused to back its pay award			1
the discontent among @entity4 shareholders also goes beyond the recent upsurge in investor activism expressed in non-binding votes on pay at other big banks including @entity80 and @entity81			2
a large number of shareholders are expected to refuse to give management a clean bill of health for 2011 because of the trading scandal and @entity4 's admission that the incident revealed " shortcomings " in its risk management			1
under @entity7 law , an investor forfeits most rights to sue management for actions in a given year by formally voting to " discharge " it of responsibility for that period			2
the trading scandal has triggered management changes including the replacement of chief executive @entity101 by @entity102 last september			0
at the annual meeting , investors are being asked to elect @entity105 , former @entity106 president , to succeed @entity107 , outgoing chairman			0
two years ago shareholders voted against discharging the former management of responsibility for 2007 , the year before the credit crisis brought the bank to the brink of collapse			0
@entity4 has already been berated by a strong minority of investors over its pay structures for two consecutive years			1
last year , more than a third who voted refused to back the pay report and in 2010 more than 45 per cent of investors declined to endorse it			0
@entity25 , the influential @entity123 proxy firm and @entity26 , the @entity7 activist investor that advises domestic pension funds both recommended their clients vote against the discharge of the management and the remuneration report			1
" @entity25 continues to have concerns about lack of safeguards against excessive pay and poor pay practices , lack of disclosure in key areas , and certain aspects of @entity4 's remuneration system , " the advisory group said in a recent note to clients .			2
