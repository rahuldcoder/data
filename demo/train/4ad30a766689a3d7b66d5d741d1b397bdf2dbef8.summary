" we have nowhere to return to , " @entity13 speaker @entity40 told fellow lawmakers there			0
@entity7 's @entity6 - backed transitional government took office after @entity17 troops invaded the country at its request in december 2006			1
the @entity17 invasion ousted the @entity50 , an @entity2 movement that had claimed control of the capital @entity53 earlier that year			2
@entity17 's invasion had the blessing of the @entity56 , which accused the @entity50 of harboring fugitives from @entity58			0
