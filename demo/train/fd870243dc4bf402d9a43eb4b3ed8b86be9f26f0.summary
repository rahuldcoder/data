@entity1 @entity0 are sensing that a world seemingly spinning out of control could give them an opening to reclaim their traditional strength on national security issues heading into the 2016 presidential election			1
even before terrorists killed 12 people at a @entity12 magazine this week , @entity0 were fine - tuning an assault on president @entity15 's foreign policy as timid and naive , and stumbling everywhere from the deserts of @entity17 to the @entity18 in @entity19			1
but one of the brothers who carried out the @entity12 strike spent several months in @entity23 in 2011 , according to @entity25 officials , receiving weapons training and working with @entity27			0
that could undermine @entity15 's proud claim of dismantling @entity27 's " core " and put @entity31 on the defensive -- especially @entity33 , who carried out the president 's foreign policy as his first - term secretary of state			2
" there are big opportunities for @entity0 to reclaim their traditional voter advantage on national security , " said @entity38 , a former @entity39 , and @entity41 official in the @entity43 @entity42			1
" to most @entity25 , the world feels like a dangerous place right now			0
six years into ( the ) @entity15 administration , it is difficult for president @entity15 to blame that on anybody but himself			2
" until 2008 , @entity0 enjoyed a perception among voters for several decades that they -- and not @entity31 -- were best suited to lead @entity25 's national security policy			1
but @entity15 reversed that conceit by arguing that former president @entity43 squandered global goodwill after the september 11 attacks with a unilateralist foreign policy , the invasion of @entity63 and " tough talk " that alienated @entity25 allies			1
" we are the party of @entity67			0
we are the party of @entity69			0
so do n't tell me that @entity31 wo n't defend this country			0
do n't tell me that @entity31 wo n't keep us safe , " @entity15 told @entity25 as he accepted his party 's 2008 nomination			2
four years later , @entity15 turned a similar trick , brandishing his leadership in hunting down @entity77 leader @entity76 and ending the war in @entity63			2
the president painted @entity0 @entity80 as a vacillating hawk who wanted to return to endless war and taunted his opponent over his anti-russia rhetoric by suggesting " the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back			2
" foreign policy as an issue is rarely decisive in presidential elections -- at least once a candidate has managed to convince voters he or she is up to being commander - in - chief			0
but a chaotic global environment which defies @entity25 efforts to exert control -- even if it is not all the fault of the sitting president -- is rarely good news for the party in control of the @entity42 and key players in the @entity0 national security establishment believe that foreign policy could feature especially prominently in the coming election			1
potential candidates like sen. @entity108 and @entity109 have been quick to spot the political potential of such an environment heading into the 2016 race -- and are already waging their own internal duel over the party 's national security message			1
broadly , the establishment @entity0 critique of @entity15 is that far from his promise to reestablish @entity25 leadership , he has instead presided over an era of disengagement from the world			1
@entity0 complain @entity15 is happier chatting to foreign dictators of longtime @entity25 enemies such as @entity126 and @entity127 than traditional @entity25 allies like @entity129 , the @entity130 or even @entity132 powers			1
and they claim that @entity15 's deliberate -- critics would say hesitant -- brand of global leadership on issues like @entity17 has deepened the global crisis and abdicated @entity25 leadership			2
of all the potential @entity0 candidates , @entity108 has developed the most sweeping case against @entity15 's foreign policy , as he has sought to frame himself as a statesman - in - waiting after four years in the @entity143			1
he warned in a @entity145 op - ed in november that @entity15 " peeps timidly from behind an ever - thinning curtain of @entity25 strength , watching idly as new and resurgent forces challenge global order			2
" even as an increasingly hostile @entity158 threatens a new cold war , president @entity15 uses baby - steps and half - measures in defense of our allies , our principles , and our people , when he acts at all , " @entity108 said , using the 25th anniversary of the fall of the @entity153 to paint himself as the heir to @entity156 's foreign policy legacy			1
@entity108 's fellow @entity168 @entity167 has yet to lay out his foreign policy since moves to explore a possible presidential campaign , other than to slam @entity15 's plan to reestablish diplomatic relations with @entity127			1
but he signaled in a @entity176 forum late last year that he would associate himself with the traditional @entity0 orthodoxy on foreign policy			2
in general terms , that means more defense spending and robust @entity25 rhetoric backed up by action -- an approach likely shared by other possible @entity0 candidates including @entity187 gov. @entity186 and @entity189 gov. @entity188			1
@entity43 also believes that @entity25 's role in the world will become an increasingly potent campaign issue			2
" six months ago , i would have said it might be a continuing of the focus on domestic issues because they are big and they are challenging , " he said at the forum			0
" but there is a growing awareness that we ca n't withdraw from the world			0
there is an unraveling taking place			0
" he added : " i do think that foreign policy and maybe a reevaluation of what the role is of the @entity25 in the world will become is important			0
" before they go after @entity15 however , @entity0 have to get their own story straight on foreign policy as a debate plays out by traditional national security hawks and a more nuanced stance embodied by @entity109			1
the @entity216 senator , who comes from the libertarian tradition , has been keen to dispel perceptions that he is an isolationist as he considers how to build a coalition that could lead to the @entity0 nomination			2
but he still stands for a restrained use of @entity25 military force overseas			0
he explains that he backed the use of force against @entity27 after the @entity225 , 2001 , attacks , but opposes a continued long - term @entity25 engagement in @entity228			0
" yes , we need a hammer ready , but not every civil war is a nail , " he said in a major foreign policy speech in october			0
" we need a foreign policy that recognized our limits , preserves our might and a common sense conservative realism of strength and action			0
" there is an irony to the coming @entity0 assault on @entity15 's foreign policy , because it mimics the strategy the president himself used to pave the way to the @entity42			1
but it is n't a given that @entity0 hopes of exploiting a national security meltdown abroad will pan out because the opening exchanges of a presidential campaign are often a poor guide to the themes and issues that will decide it			1
if , for instance , the current economic bounce back fizzles , the plight of the middle class could outweigh all other issues			0
" it 's a heck of a long time , there is plenty of time for domestic issues to return and be number one , " said @entity262 , a former @entity39 official for @entity43 and @entity263 , now with @entity264			0
" but on the other hand it does seem likely that foreign policy will seem even more salient in 2016 than it was in 2012			0
" and @entity15 can still claim to have crushed the leadership of @entity27 in tribal regions of @entity277 and @entity228 , and waged a largely covert drone war against extremists elsewhere			0
he sees his presidency as a historic mission to move @entity25 on from the post- sept. 11 period of constant war and to chart a sustainable strategy to fight extremism			0
any @entity0 candidate using foreign policy as a cudgel to attack against what will likely become known as the " @entity290 " foreign policy , must deal with one large elephant in the room -- @entity43			1
there is little public appetite for the era of intervention that characterized @entity43 's presidency and @entity0 face the task of winning back public trust			1
but @entity38 said any @entity0 running on a foreign policy platform would be able to acknowledge the faults of the last @entity0 presidency , while refocusing on the presidency of @entity15			1
there are " legitimate criticisms of @entity43 administration foreign policy , but ( they ) are hard to sustain after eight years of a @entity31 presidency , " she said .			0

@entity0 believe world *turmoil* undermines @entity15
but @entity0 yet to resolve its own argument on national security
