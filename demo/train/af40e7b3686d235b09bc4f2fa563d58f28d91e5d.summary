" finally , she said , she spoke to a third flight attendant before the plane departed @entity15			1

about half way through the flight , she said attendants seated a young @entity7 man in the empty seat next to her			1
she said the man was wearing a striped blue shirt			2
photos of the @entity7 man with and without the disguise were contained in the alert from the @entity38 about the incident			2
she said she could not be sure , but it could have been the same man who was moved next to her during the flight			1
" the flight attendant said this guy 's seat was not working so they sat him right next to me in the middle seat , " she said			1
after the plane landed , she did not see the man again			2
