-- last monday , only a few people knew about an obscure @entity5 video produced in the @entity6 , people around the world are aware of it			1
the video sparked protests worldwide , starting in @entity10 and @entity11 , and then spreading to other countries			1
tragically , some of the protests turned violent and took the lives of @entity16 , @entity11 , tunisians and @entity18			2
the protests have subsided for now , it seems			2
in assessing what happened , we have to be cautious and ensure that we do not point fingers in the wrong direction			1
as things become clearer , it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the @entity16 @entity29 -- a community with its roots in @entity10			1
it is understandable that @entity32 worldwide were deeply offended by the video			1
the @entity34 called the video " hateful " and the @entity37 administration called it " disgusting			2
" but , there were other elements at work in the some of the protests ; there are those who used anger at the video to promote their own agendas			1
for example , the attack on the @entity16 @entity47 in @entity11 was likely a terrorist operation that took advantage of the protests			2
in the midst of all this , it is not surprising that some people looked to assign blame and demand apologies			2
these people within the @entity60 world began blaming the @entity62 community -- a community whose very name means " @entity10			1
" in response , the @entity64 , both in @entity10 as well as in the @entity16 , insisted that it has nothing to do with the video			0
it also said that the video does not in any way represent the view of the @entity62 community			1
i do know a copt who was involved with the promotion of the video			1
i met @entity76 earlier this year			0
@entity76 's personal actions have nothing to do with the @entity64 or the @entity62 - @entity16 community			1
virtually no @entity29 i encountered had heard of him before			0
they know about him now			0
and in response , he received a volley of shoes from outraged members of the @entity62 community for his promotion of bigotry			1
it is a mark of @entity29 value for the @entity64 to condemn the video and its filmmakers			0
but the @entity64 should never be placed in the position of having to apologize for the actions of a few of its members			1
the same applies to @entity32			1
from the local representatives of @entity32 communities in @entity16 , to the religious establishments of @entity10 and @entity11 , to the leadership of the @entity102 , which represents all @entity32 countries , we have heard apologies and condemnations for the violence			2
the @entity32 community at large is not responsible for the violence , and it should not be expected to apologize for the actions of some of its members			1
the violent actions of a comparatively small number of individuals do not represent all @entity32 , just as the video does not represent the views of all @entity62			1
neither group needs to apologize , but both should be recognized for their solidarity in condemning the violence			0
at some point , there do need to be levelheaded discussions about hate speech ( which is legal in @entity16 , unlike most other countries ) , the roots of widespread anti-americanism in the @entity128 and elsewhere , and what different cultures consider as sacred			0
before that can take place , we should be careful about whom we hold accountable			0
it should be those who have been directly fanning the flames of intolerance not just over the last few months , but over the years			0
the video did not appear in a vacuum			0
there is a well - organized network that thrives on promoting @entity144 bigotry within the @entity16 it provided an ideological base for @entity146 , recently convicted of mass murder in @entity148			0
similarly , there are those within the @entity151 who also push for a hateful agenda , to devastating effect			0
the last few days are just a reminder of how important it is to confront such promoters of hate			0
whether it 's through legal channels or social pressures , they must be dealt with			0
their aim , simply , is to engineer cultural wars between non-muslims and @entity32			2
that must not be allowed to happen			0
the least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals			1
that is , after all , precisely what they want -- for us to do their dirty work for them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

an *anti-islam* video that sparked protests seems to have involved @entity62
@entity179 : we must not point fingers in the wrong direction
he says the video does not in any way represent the view of the @entity62 community
@entity179 : coptics , @entity32 should not have to apologize for the actions of a few people
