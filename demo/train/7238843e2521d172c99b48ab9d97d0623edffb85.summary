if you 're uneasy at the idea of riding in a vehicle that drives itself , just wait till you see @entity5 's new car			1
it has no gas pedal , no brake and no steering wheel			0
@entity5 has been demonstrating its driverless technology for several years by retrofitting @entity11 , @entity12 and other cars with cameras and sensors			2
but now , for the first time , the company has unveiled a prototype of its own : a cute little car that looks like a cross between a @entity22 and a golf cart			1
" they wo n't have a steering wheel , accelerator pedal , or brake pedal ... because they do n't need them , " @entity5 said tuesday in a blog post introducing the unnamed electric vehicles			2
" our software and sensors do all the work			0
" unlike previous models , these cars wo n't have human drivers monitoring them at all times			0
@entity5 said the cars can detect objects up to 200 yards away in all directions and adjust their speed , turns and braking accordingly			1
the cars ' speed for now has been capped at 25 mph , allowing engineers to minimize the risk of crashes during testing			1
inside , the spartan cars have few dashboard controls , no glove box and no stereo			0
" we 've designed for learning , not luxury , so we 're light on creature comforts , " @entity5 said			0
" but we 'll have two seats ( with seatbelts ) , a space for passengers ' belongings , buttons to start and stop , and a screen that shows the route -- and that 's about it			0
" @entity5 did not explain how the car navigates , although passengers would presumably punch in a destination on the dashboard screen and let the computers do the rest			2
the company plans to build about 100 prototype vehicles and begin testing them later this summer			1
if everything goes well , @entity5 then will run a small pilot program in @entity81 over the next few years			0
the cars represent another step into hardware for @entity5 , which in recent years has introduced its glass connected headset and bought @entity87 , a startup that makes " smart " thermostats and smoke detectors			2
@entity5 said it eventually hopes to partner with an automaker to produce the self - driving vehicles instead of building them itself			1
the bubblelike @entity5 cars arrive as the @entity96 is struggling to accept a sci - fi future of robotic vehicles and other technological advancements			1
a recent @entity101 survey found that half of @entity96 would not ride in a self - driving car			1
four states -- @entity81 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 -- now allow self - driving vehicles on their roads as long as a human driver is behind the wheel at all times			1
most major automakers are also developing vehicles that drive autonomously			0
@entity5 posted a video tuesday featuring testimonials from people who had ridden in the new cars			2
" the human feeling of it is very well engineered , and it is very smooth , " said an older man identified only as @entity119			0
" there 's nothing that makes you feel the least bit threatened			0
