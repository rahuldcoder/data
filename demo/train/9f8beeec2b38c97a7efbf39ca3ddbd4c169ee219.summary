-- @entity1 began biking to work three years ago to improve her health			1
several times a month , she loaded her bike onto her car , drove most of the way and biked the last three miles to her office			1
bit by bit , she shortened her time in the car and extended the bike ride			1
now , the 50 - year - old @entity11 woman says she bikes all the way to work several times a month from her home in @entity15 to @entity16 : 25 miles each way , amounting to about two hours of travel time			1
it 's no easy feat , and not something most @entity22 are willing or able to do , especially in suburban and rural communities , where bike paths are scant and cars are the only way to get around			1
the rate of workers commuting by bicycle doubled between 2001 and 2009 , according to @entity30			0
but that still amounted to less than 1 % of @entity22 reporting in 2009 that they used bicycles as their primary mode of transportation to work , according to the @entity36 's @entity35			1
in honor of @entity38 to @entity39 , @entity0 asked its @entity41 fans what it would take to get them to bike to work more often			1
a shorter commute and more bike lanes were by far the most common responses			1
" i would do it every day ( if ) the weather permitted , if my work was actually within biking distance , " @entity47 wrote			1
" i have an hour to travel by car			0
probably take a day or two by bike			1
" read more comments on @entity0 's @entity41 page cleanliness and body odor were also frequent concerns			0
others simply preferred the solace of a morning drive			0
" the climate has to be right , the distance not too far , the commuter 's health not an issue , a lack of fast , simple , reliable and safe public transportation needs to exist , " @entity61 said			0
" a shower and locker to change clothes must be provided by my employer , and a way to blast @entity74 while i peddle must be allowed			0
otherwise i ai n't doing it			0
" some suggested that the idea itself was outdated			0
" what i think we really need to focus on are more fuel - efficient vehicles , better city planning for the number and types of vehicles on the road , and more public transportation options , " @entity79 said			1
" this is the 21st century after all ; trying to solve modern problems with solutions over 100 years old is just simply not going to work			1
why not change this to ' what 's your solution ? week ( where you send your ideas to manufacturers , politicians , city officials , etc. ) " instead of ' bike to @entity39			1
' " or , in the words of @entity101 : " bike to work ? are you crazy ? @entity103 is money ! ! ! " but those who bike to work swear by the financial rewards and health benefits			1
and yes , there 's a bit of a do - gooder element to it			0
" it is a good way to clear your brain from all the sh * t at work , " @entity112 said			1
" the only thing i wish is there were more bike paths alongside the highways			1
i think if there were i bet a lot more people would be biking it to work ; not only that it is good for the green factor ( but ) good for your health			1
" bike safety 101 @entity1 acknowledged that a considerable amount of time and planning goes into her ride			1
a neuropsychologist with her own practice , she bikes only when her morning schedule is open			0
when she does , she carpools home with her husband			0
she takes into consideration weather and wind conditions , avoiding snow , ice and high winds			0
most importantly , she said she learned to ride with a light load and keep a set of professional attire at work to change into			2
she said she uses side roads as much as possible , although there is a long stretch of highway that she can not avoid			2
she said believes she has just as much right to use the roads as drivers			2
" i do n't do it more often because it requires the ' intersection ' of a couple of factors , " @entity1 said in an e-mail			0
" we belong on the road			1
it is safest for everyone for bicyclists to be on the road -- that is why it is the law			2
and @entity174 honking and yelling at us			1
" she 's right , though the rules vary from state to state , said @entity179 , president of the @entity180			0
the group is the national sponsor of @entity182			2
bicyclists are allowed to use most roads with the exception of high - speed limited access roads such as highways or interstates , which have few interchanges , @entity179 said			2
" as a general rule , particularly in urban areas , the road networks are such that there are viable alternatives to highways and interstates , and cyclists are able to use the rest of the roadwork , " he said			1
" outside of urban areas , cyclists are allowed to use interstates as well because they have no other options			2
" each state has its own bicycle and pedestrian coordinator within the @entity205 that can provide specific information , he said			0
if cyclists have the right to the same roads as cars , there are a few drivers who are n't happy about it			1
dozens of @entity41 commenters said cyclists had no place on the road if they did n't have a bike lane to ride in			1
" cyclists , stay off the roads without bike lanes ! ! you slow down traffic and are putting yourself in danger ! " @entity223 said			1
if cyclists want to share the road , they need to follow the same rules as cars , many said			1
@entity230 traffic lights , go in the same direction of traffic and ride single file when traveling in a group			2
" bikers need to follow the rules of the road , too			2
i can not tell you how many times i 'm at a four - way stop , etc. , and they fly right through , " @entity238 said			0
" also , keep in mind if you 're biking , you 're not @entity244			0
i 'm sick of seeing walkers hit by bikers			0
" when it comes to signaling for turns , many commenters said they felt that both drivers and cyclists could do better			1
" use your flippin ' hand signs cyclists ! ! " @entity254 said			2
" ca n't tell ya how many times i almost turned one of you guys into street pizza because you did n't warn me of your turns			0
" the matter of sidewalks was an area of dispute			0
some said cyclists should use them in the absence of bike lanes , while others bristled at the thought of them stealing the space from pedestrians			1
" sidewalks are for pedestrians			0
cyclists need to understand bike laws ; to not ride on the sidewalks and to obey traffic signals , " wrote @entity275 , who also commented that " cuter bike helmets " would encourage her to bike more often			1
on the flipsde , @entity286 wrote , " i would much rather see a cyclist use the sidewalk than the street			0
how often do you really see people walking on sidewalks ? what 's more dangerous ? # commonsense			0
" cyclists also had advice for other cyclists : earn the respect of drivers by following the rules and making your presence seen			2
wear a helmet all the time and reflective gear at night , make sure to have insurance and do n't assume drivers are paying attention			0
they also had advice for drivers on how to share the road better : put down the phone and pay greater attention			2
" @entity312 , eating , putting @entity314 ( @entity315 ) , talking on the phone while driving , " @entity311 said			0
" cars , depending on your city , you most likely have to treat bikes as vehicles whether you like it or not , " @entity318 said			0
" remember that messing with bikers often results in needing new windshields , hoods , or mirrors due to @entity330 justice			0
" more than anything , they 're asking for respect			0
" cyclists can ride faster than you think			2
we respect you so respect us , " @entity336 said			0
" if you 're worried about those five seconds to safely get around a cyclist so you wo n't be late for work , you should have left 30 minutes earlier			2
share the road ! " what do you think ? share your thoughts in the comments !			2

*friday* marks national bike to @entity346
@entity349 commute , more bike lanes would *inspire* more commenters to bike to work
" we belong on the road . *...* get over it . and @entity174 honking and yelling at us , " one rider says
" cyclists , stay off the roads without bike lanes ! ! you slow down traffic , " driver says
