-- they were a @entity2 group of artists that gave birth to the impressionism art movement , so it is perhaps fitting that one of their devotees records the @entity11 with those broad brushstrokes			1
year after year , @entity13 makes the short pilgrimage from his @entity2 studio to the @entity16 for the tennis year 's second grand slam , aiming to encapsulate the tournament 's magic onto his canvas			1
in a style reminiscent of those @entity24 forefathers , he brings to life in his paintings what he witnesses taking place in front of him on the famous red clay courts			2
" when i begin the painting , i do n't know exactly what will happen but i know what i want to introduce in the beginning			2
after , it 's a story of life , " he told @entity0 's @entity37			2
" i know how it begins , but i do n't know how it finishes			2
" a key principle of @entity43 was to paint outdoors rather than inside a studio , so it 's a style tailor - made to @entity13 's own way of working			1
it 's an approach that has won over tennis stars such as @entity48 or @entity49 -- both fans and owners of the @entity52 's paintings -- or television companies , who invite him to cover sporting events			1
making his first visit to depict the action on the main court of @entity59 in 2004 , @entity13 has returned every year since , attracted by both the stadium and the @entity11 's allure and charm			1
" @entity16 is my favorite place , " says the 68 - year - old			1
" it 's very special , it 's near to my studio , i 'm like a neighbor			2
" it 's like a fascination in @entity2 , the time of @entity16 in @entity2 is very special so there is a real attraction , " he says			1
" i am very proud to be there			2
" the painter had to wait some time , however , before that short pilgrimage from his studio could become a reality			0
in the same way that the original artists of the @entity43 movement , established in @entity2 in the 1870s , initially drew criticism for their apparent trivial approach to art , @entity13 had his own detractors -- his parents			1
they wanted him to forge a career as a surgeon or dentist rather than become an artist -- something that ultimately put him in good stead years down the line			0
" i have to thank them for that as they obliged me not to be an artist just like that , they obliged me to learn anatomy at school , " says @entity13 , who was born in @entity95 in the south of @entity52			1
" but all those years of learning actually gave me the great freedom for painting -- from horses to the body , from landscape to anything i have to draw			0
i know the proportions , i know everything			0
i 'm able to do it			0
" from the late 1880s the public 's perception became more favorable towards the @entity43 movement , much like the trajectory of @entity13 's career			1
following an education at the @entity121 , @entity13 first developed his passion for capturing the moment in equestrian events -- making a living out of depicting horses and their riders			1
and in keeping with the tradition of @entity43 , he also often found himself recreating scenes from the @entity52 countryside			1
it was not until far further down the line , though , at the age of 57 , that @entity13 got his real break as an artist when he was invited to cover the @entity136 in @entity2 in 2003 by @entity52 television station @entity52 2			1
" i knew this was what i wanted to do			0
i was supported by the runners as i put all my body into my work , so i was like one of them , " he recalls			0
" this woman asked me to finish a painting and give it to a 100 - meter runner at the end , so i finished it in 10 seconds and gave it to him ! " that success prompted another invitation from @entity52 2 to cover the following year 's @entity11			1
" in my work , i need to have a challenge and draw something that other people ca n't do , so i turned to sport , " he says			0
" what i feel when i do this type of painting is a communion with what i draw			0
" i have to be not inside ( the athlete ) but it 's something like communion -- my eyes and my hand			0
i do n't take care of my hand , it 's only a problem of mind			0
" @entity13 , who has covered other sports such as golf and rugby , thrives on the unpredictability of capturing these instant action moments			1
" every sport has its own specialty			0
for example , polo ... it 's like a fight , it 's very quick and the movement of horses change in a second , " he says			0
" so if you do n't decide what you want to represent , it 's like rugby , it changes very quickly			2
if you do n't decide quickly , you are lost			0
you have to clear your mind in every sport			0
" when @entity13 first put his easel on the side of a tennis court , he was unaware of the endless possibilities that were about to unfold both on court and in his mind			1
" the first time i thought , like for golf , that tennis was always the same , " he says			2
" i have been painting @entity49 and @entity48 for years and years when they were always in the final , in @entity203 and at @entity16 , and i could say it 's always the same story			2
" but it 's not , because there is an adaption from one to the other and the strategy of each one is very specific , and the movements then change			0
and the movement has to be taken in the very instant			0
" sport is by nature cyclical , adds @entity13 , but the same events every year bring fresh inspiration			1
" if something new does n't happen then the people will be bored by that , but every time we all witness something new without fail			0

@entity13 paints live at the @entity11 every year
the @entity52 first painted at @entity16 in 2004
@entity13 has also painted sports as *diverse* as rugby , golf and athletics
