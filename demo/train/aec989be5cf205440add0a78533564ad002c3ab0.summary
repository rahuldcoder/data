@entity0 the cheering , clapping fans are greeting them with choruses of oohs and ahhs , hero worship for the rock stars of the sea : whales			1
whale - watching boats out of @entity13 are reporting almost every excursion returns to harbor with giddy patrons carrying images of large marine mammals in their cameras and minds			0
" this season has just been magical , there 's just no other way to describe it , " said @entity20 , a captain for @entity21			1
" and this is just the beginning of gray whale season			1
it 's going to go all the way until may			1
" the gray whales are making their annual migration south from the @entity30 where they feed , down to @entity31 , where they breed during winter and late spring			1
" we know that the ocean is changing , the @entity38 is warming , the ice melting , and this might be giving the gray whales more ( easier ) access to food , " said @entity34 , marine biologist with the @entity35			2
" with more access to food , the gray whales might be able to leave the @entity30 waters earlier			1
" during a recent @entity20 trip , the captain closely followed two gray whales making a parallel journey south near @entity52			1
the whales flipped their flukes out of the water and took dives , while dozens of eyes and cameras followed each move			2
@entity20 left that pair of migrating gray whales to search for a second set of gray whales , a rarity , a mother and her brand new calf			2
" there 's mama and there 's baby , " the captain shouted over the boat 's loudspeaker			1
" the baby was born today			0
" the mother and baby cetaceans dipped underwater and reappeared , often with a spritz from their blowholes			0
on this trip , the gray whales did not breech out of the water completely , looking like some sort of slick television commercial			2
those picture postcard breeches are uncommon , according to biologists and whale tour boat captains , but any sight of any part of a whale caused celebration			0
" @entity1 had that pretty interesting documentary , " @entity94 , " and it brought a lot of attention to our customers , to where they mentioned how excited they were to see the whales in the wild , their natural environment , " said @entity20			0
" since that documentary our business has increased and we will hear the kids cheering , ' they are free			0
' " orcas , killer whales in captivity , were the subject of " @entity94			0
" free - swimming orcas have been spotted this season in @entity13 along with some humpback whales and the usual preponderance of a variety of dolphins playfully jumping in clusters			1
wide - eyed and smiling children chattered with each sighting			0
" i 've been seeing @entity121 and the birth of a new whale , " said 11 - year - old @entity119 from @entity120			0
" and the awesome dolphins , which are my favorite ocean animal , so it 's been good			0
