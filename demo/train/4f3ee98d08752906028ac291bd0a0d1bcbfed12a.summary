-- a @entity2 passenger jet crashed in a rebel - controlled part of eastern @entity5 on thursday , spurring swift accusations from @entity5 officials that " terrorists " shot down the aircraft			1
the @entity11 has concluded a missile shot down the plane , but has n't pinpointed who was responsible , a senior @entity11 official told @entity0 's @entity15			1
the @entity16 with 298 people aboard fell from the sky near the town of @entity20 in the @entity22 region of eastern @entity5 , officials said			1
a top @entity5 official said the plane , which was on the way from @entity26 to @entity27 , was flying at about 10,000 meters ( nearly 33,000 feet ) when the missile hit			1
a radar system saw a surface - to - air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down , the senior @entity11 official said			1
a second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit , the official said			2
the @entity11 is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from , the official said			1
the @entity44 administration believes @entity5 did not have the capability in the region -- let alone the motivation -- to shoot down the plane , a @entity11 official told @entity0 's @entity49			1
@entity51 prime minister @entity50 said the plane never made a distress call			2
he called for an international team to have full access to the crash site			2
" we must and we will find out precisely what happened to this flight			0
no stone will be left unturned , " he said			0
" if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down , we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice , " @entity50 said			2
@entity5 officials maintained that @entity67 separatists were behind the crash			1
@entity70 president @entity69 said @entity5 's military campaign against the separatists was to blame			1
" this tragedy would not have happened , if there had been peace on that land , or in any case , if military operations in southeastern @entity5 had not been renewed , " @entity69 said in televised remarks			1
" and without a doubt the government of the territory on which it happened bears responsibility for this frightening tragedy			0
" @entity5 's state security chief accused two @entity70 military intelligence officers of involvement and said they must be punished			1
@entity89 said he based his allegation on intercepts of phone conversations between the two officers			0
" now you know who carried out this crime			0
we will do everything for the @entity70 military who carried out this crime to be punished , " he told reporters			2
the jet plunged toward the ground in a fireball , leaving a trail of black smoke behind in the sky			0
emergency crews scrambled to what witnesses described as a staggering scene of death and utter destruction			0
" people said the plane kind of exploded in the air , and that everything rained down in bits and pieces , the plane itself , the people inside , " said @entity115 , an @entity11 freelance journalist who interviewed witnesses at the scene			1
charred wreckage stretched for kilometers , he said			0
stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area , @entity115 said , planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields			0
" as you walk through the fields , you see a man with his cracked @entity140 sticking out of his pocket			0
you see sort of people 's clothing everywhere			2
most of it 's kind of ripped off by the air			2
there 's some suitcases and stuff in a pile by the road , " @entity115 said			2
there were many bodies left to be found as night fell , he said , and people were trying to figure out what to do next			0
locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed , he said			0
firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it , spraying water everywhere , he said			0
" one man said to me , ' nothing 's happened in this village for 30 years , and now this , ' " @entity115 said			2
as details emerge , accusations fly details -- and accusations -- quickly poured in about thursday 's crash , which came the same week that @entity5 officials said a @entity70 fighter shot down a @entity5 military transport plane while the aircraft was in @entity5 airspace			1
@entity178 , adviser to the @entity179 , said in a @entity181 post that " terrorists " fired on the plane operating a @entity184 surface - to - air missile system			2
@entity5 president @entity186 described the crash as a " terrorist action			1
" " we do not exclude that the plane was shot down and confirm that the @entity191 did not fire at any targets in the sky , " @entity5 president @entity186 said , according to his website			1
@entity0 's @entity195 , an aviation expert , said that it would be " extremely unusual " for an airliner at nearly 33,000 feet to be shot down			2
from the ground , one could simply look up and tell whether a plane was a commercial aircraft , he said			2
" so something is absolutely appalling that 's gone on here			2
" @entity11 vice president @entity203 said that @entity5 's president had accepted an offer of @entity11 experts to help investigate the crash			1
" they will be on their way rapidly to see if we can get to the bottom of this , " he said			0
@entity203 said the plane was apparently shot down , adding " not an accident , blown out of the sky			2
" who was on the plane ? the 15 crew members on @entity220 were all @entity51 nationals , officials said			1
@entity2 also gave a breakdown of the known nationalities of the 283 passengers : 154 were @entity224 , 27 were @entity225 , 28 were @entity51 , 12 were @entity226 , nine were from the @entity227 , four were from @entity228 ; four were from @entity229 , three were from the @entity230 and one was @entity232			0
authorities were still trying to determine the nationalities of the other passengers			0
the @entity236 said in a statement that " a number of colleagues and friends " were on the plane , on the way to attend the 20th @entity240 in @entity241 , @entity225			2
" at this incredibly sad and sensitive time the @entity246 stands with our international family and sends condolences to the loved ones of those who have been lost to this tragedy , " the statement said			2
@entity70 - @entity5 dispute the route the @entity51 plane was on , between @entity27 and the @entity224 , is a common one , @entity0 aviation safety consultant @entity257 said thursday			1
she said that the plane was flying over a troubled area and that close communication with air traffic controllers would be a key necessity			0
@entity263 is in a rebel - held area			0
in hostile or disputed areas , " any alteration from your course , and you can have a problem , " @entity257 said			0
tensions have been high between @entity5 and @entity70 since street protests forced former @entity275 president @entity274 from power in february			1
@entity70 subsequently annexed @entity5 's southeastern @entity278 region , and a @entity67 separatist rebellion has been raging in @entity5 's eastern @entity281 and @entity22 regions			1
@entity5 forces have been struggling to quell the separatist unrest			1
@entity5 's government has accused @entity70 of allowing weapons and military equipment , including tanks , to cross the border illegally into the hands of @entity67 separatists			1
the @entity291 said wednesday that @entity70 now has 12,000 troops on the border with @entity5 , as well as some heavy weapons			1
the troop numbers had fallen to about 1,000 previously from a high of an estimated 40,000 forces earlier this year			0
on thursday , @entity0 reported that @entity5 officials said a @entity70 fighter shot down a @entity5 jet wednesday as the jet flew in @entity5 airspace			1
tensions are high over that incident , separate from the breaking news of the @entity51 flight thursday			0
three months ago , the @entity307 prohibited @entity11 airlines from flying in areas not far from where @entity310 reportedly crashed thursday			1
" due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control instructions from @entity5 and @entity70 authorities and for the related potential misidentification of civil aircraft , @entity11 flight operations are prohibited until further notice in the airspace over @entity278 , the @entity320 and the @entity321 , " the @entity307 said in april			1
thursday 's plane crash reportedly was in eastern @entity5 , scores of miles north - northeast of the @entity321			1
on thursday , @entity327 transportation official @entity326 ordered that @entity327 airlines avoid @entity5 airspace until the cause of thursday 's @entity2 crash is known , the @entity325 said in a news release			1
airline 's troubles thursday 's crash marks the second time this year that @entity2 has faced an incident involving a downed plane			1
on march 8 , @entity339 disappeared			0
that @entity16 had 239 people on board			0
searchers have found no trace of 370 or its passengers , despite extensive search efforts			0
@entity339 probably flew into the southern @entity347 on autopilot with an unresponsive crew , @entity225 authorities said last month			0
during the early phase of the search for flight 370 , aircraft and ships scoured vast stretches of the surface of the southern @entity347 but found no debris			0
@entity358 initially thought to be from the missing plane 's flight recorders led to a concentrated underwater search that turned up nothing			1
a new underwater search , farther south , will be broadly in an area where planes and vessels had already looked for debris on the surface of the water			0
it is expected to begin in august			0
the first @entity16 entered service in june 1995 , and the airplane has flown almost five million flights , accumulating more than 18 million flight hours , according to @entity16 's web site			0
the plane is capable to flying up to 43,100 feet			0
what next ? aviation experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions about thursday 's crash at this early stage			0
but all agreed that a massive investigation should be launched , involving parties not involved in the conflict between @entity5 and @entity70 , the families of people on board will demand a transparent international investigation , and so will the global community , @entity385 said			1
in the coming days , finding and examining the plane 's data recorders will be key -- but the fact that the crash occurred in such a volatile region makes what comes next anything but certain , @entity0 aviation analyst and pilot @entity398 said			1
" the big question will be , in whose hands will they fall , and will this be a really objective , international investigation ? " he said			1
the wreckage path , @entity398 said , will reveal a lot			0
if a plane breaks up in midair , which is likely what would happen in a missile strike , there would be a large swath of wreckage , he said , but if it breaks down due to mechanical failure , the debris field would be more concentrated			0
@entity417 : the approximate route of @entity419 @entity0 's @entity420 , @entity421 , @entity422 , @entity423 and @entity424 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity11 official : @entity44 administration believes @entity5 did n't have capability to shoot down plane
analyst : in volatile region , will there be " a really objective , international investigation ? "
