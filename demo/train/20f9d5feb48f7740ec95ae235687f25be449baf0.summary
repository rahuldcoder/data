-- @entity2 millionaire @entity1 was found guilty friday after being accused of driving drunk , hitting another vehicle and running it off the road into a canal , where its driver was later found dead in his submerged car			1
@entity1 , 48 , was found guilty on the two counts he was charged with			2
the first was @entity13 manslaughter and failure to render aid			1
the second was vehicular homicide and failure to give information to authorities or aid			1
the @entity22 jury reached its verdict after about 5Â½ hours of deliberation , following closing arguments thursday afternoon			0
a sentencing hearing is set for april 30 , with @entity1 potentially facing 11Â½ to 30 years in prison			2
until then , circuit judge @entity28 revoked @entity1 's bond and ordered that he be detained by authorities			1
the victim 's mother , @entity31 , thanked the jury after the verdict and took solace in her belief that " justice has been served			2
" " i 'm always going to miss my son			0
he was the most wonderful , " she said , choking up at the thought of her son			0
" i will always cherish his memories			0
and now , coming from me and the rest of the family and his friends , it 's time for the healing process to begin			1
" the incident occurred early the morning of february 12 , 2010 , when @entity1 was driving his black @entity50 convertible in @entity51 , @entity2 , " at a high rate of speed while intoxicated , " according to a probable cause affidavit			1
@entity1 failed to halt at a stop sign , where the other driver -- @entity58 -- did n't have a stop sign and had the right of way , the affidavit said			1
the two men 's vehicles collided , causing @entity58 's car to go over a bank and roll over into a canal			2
" after the collision occurred , @entity1 made no attempt to look for @entity58 's vehicle and fled the scene of the collision on foot , " according to the affidavit from the @entity74			1
" @entity1 left the @entity75 at the scene ... and left @entity58 to drown in the canal , belted in the driver seat of his vehicle			1
" a pair of tests taken three hours later showed @entity1 's blood - alcohol content level was .177 % and .178 % -- and , based on those findings , a state toxicologist extrapolated that he was closer to a .20 % or .23 % at the time of the crash , more than three times @entity2 's legal limit			1
prosecutor @entity88 further argued that @entity1 could have saved @entity58 's life had he gone after him after the crash rather than walk away			1
" he called his friend , and she had to talk him into calling 911 , " @entity91 said during closing arguments thursday			0
" that is absolutely failure to render aid , that is absolutely failure to give information , that is absolutely not informing the authorities			0
" if the defendant had rendered aid , @entity58 would have lived			0
" @entity1 himself testified earlier in the trial , claiming he was " absolutely not " intoxicated when he left the second of two establishments he 'd gone to that night			0
he blamed a malfunction with his vehicle for his failure to stop and the fact he hit @entity58 's car			1
" i began to apply my brakes , and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as i was used to , " he said on the stand			0
" i continued to apply the brakes , i slowed before the stop sign and ... took my foot off the brake			0
and that 's the last thing i remember			0
" his lawyer , @entity121 , argued that the blood - alcohol readings do n't jibe with eyewitness testimony , saying that people saw him have three drinks and not the 20 he would have needed for such a high reading			0
and @entity121 said the observations that @entity1 's reactions appeared slow after the crash , that he had trouble gauging where he was and that he seemed confused were " consistent with the symptoms of suffering a concussion			1
" after friday 's verdict , assistant state attorney @entity134 said she suspected the jury " saw through the defense experts , " who she said " just were n't real credible " and offered " bizarre " theories			1
" ( jury members ) were very careful , they gave it a lot of thought , they went over a lot of evidence , and i think that they probably returned the only verdict that they could , " @entity134 told reporters			0
in addition to his role in the fatal crash and the subsequent trial , @entity1 made headlines a few months ago when he legally adopted @entity154 -- his " 42 - year - old girlfriend " -- according to a court order issued in late january			2
that court order was written by @entity157 circuit judge @entity156 in response to a motion filed by @entity58 's relatives			0
they are suing @entity1 -- as well as the @entity162 , which he founded -- for punitive damages tied to @entity58 's death in the crash			1
the adoption of @entity154 made her eligible for money from a trust fund created for @entity1 's children			2
the court previously noted that any money from this trust fund " may not be considered a part of the net worth , or the financial resources , of mr. @entity1 for purposes of assessing punitive damages , " the order said			0
the judge , in his order , granted the plaintiffs ' motion to get more information on the adoption			0
he also said that @entity154 ' " interest in the children 's trust may be considered in connection with defendant @entity1 's financial resources			2

new : prosecutor : defense experts were n't " credible " and had " bizarre " theories
@entity1 is *convicted* of @entity13 manslaughter and vehicular homicide tied to a 2010 crash
prosecutors say the @entity2 millionaire was drunk when he hit another car , fled the scene
the mother of the man *killed* in that crash says " it 's time for the healing process to begin "
