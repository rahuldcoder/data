with a signature on a piece of paper , convicted quadruple murderer @entity1 's life was spared			1
because @entity7 gov. @entity6 signed a " temporary reprieve " in 2013 , @entity1 's 1996 death sentence still has not been carried out			1
that 's painful for many of the loved ones of the four restaurant workers @entity1 shot to death			1
it also upsets the sole survivor of the shooting , @entity17			0
" it 's not fair , " @entity17 told @entity18			2
precedent on temporary reprieves is murky			2
no one knows for sure when the reprieve may be lifted , and @entity7 has n't executed anyone since 1997			1
@entity6 , a @entity25 , won a re-election bid in november , likely delaying @entity1 's execution for at least another four years			1
@entity1 's 1993 attack inside a @entity29 sparked a wave of anger reflected on local news broadcasts			1
prosecutors said @entity1 was seeking revenge after being fired from his job there as a cook			2
he entered the restaurant , hid in a restroom , and emerged after closing , prosecutors said			0
he then shot @entity42 , 19 ; @entity43 , 17 ; @entity44 , 17 ; and @entity45 , 50 , who was the mother of two children			0
@entity17 , 20 , who also worked there , survived			0
after @entity1 shot him in the face , he played dead until the killer fled the building			1
unanimous death sentence a high - profile trial provoked a raging debate about how society should best deal with those who commit heinous crimes			1
@entity1 's jury convicted him on four counts of murder and unanimously sentenced him to death			1
during years of appeals that followed , prison doctors officially diagnosed @entity1 with bipolar disorder , @entity65 's " @entity64 " reported			1
@entity1 's attorneys appealed , claiming his mental health was n't properly taken into account during his trial			1
@entity1 apologized to @entity17 in a letter , saying " he was sorry for what he 'd done to me , " @entity17 told @entity18			2
but @entity17 said he doubted his would - be killer 's goodwill			0
when the @entity77 @entity76 refused to hear @entity1 's final appeal , he and his attorneys took their plea for a stay to @entity6			1
" because of that and the horrible things i did , i do n't feel i have the right to ask for clemency , " @entity1 wrote in a letter to the governor , reportedly saying , " i 'd like to spare my family and friends from the same pain that i caused the victims ' families and @entity17 and his family and friends			2
" rather than give @entity1 clemency , the governor issued a " temporary reprieve , " explaining that his decision was made " not out of compassion or sympathy , " but because there " is a legitimate question whether we as a state should be taking lives			1
" " @entity7 's system for capital punishment is not flawless , " @entity6 wrote in his executive order			1
read the governor 's executive order ' mob justice ' the governor 's decision reignited the years - old @entity1 debate			1
the mother of victim @entity43 , @entity114 , told " @entity64 " she 's hoping @entity1 will avoid execution			1
" i think that he deserves to stay exactly in the hole that he 's in , and let him suffer and think about what he did			0
" @entity120 , father of victim @entity42 , told @entity121 that the governor 's decision resulted in backdoor clemency			2
@entity6 's @entity125 challenger in last november 's election , former rep. @entity127 , told @entity128 that the governor 's reprieve for @entity1 showed " an unwillingness to even make the tough call			1
" the governor 's temporary reprieve has no time limit , so theoretically , as long as @entity6 remains in office , he can continue to block @entity1 's execution			1
but a new governor could end the reprieve , clearing the way for @entity1 to die by lethal injection			1
in a way , @entity1 's fate rested in the hands of @entity7 voters last month , in a close race that @entity6 called the toughest fight of his career			1
critics said that amounted to mob justice			0
before the election , @entity1 's prosecutor , district attorney @entity152 , told " death row stories , " " there 's one person in the state of @entity7 who is more interested than the governor being re-elected than even the governor -- and that 's @entity1			1
" this is n't @entity163 's only high profile death penalty case involving mental health and a gunman			1
@entity166 has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 166 charges surrounding a movie theater shooting in 2012 that left 12 people dead			0
his trial is set to begin december 8			0
prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty			0
a complicated system @entity1 's case is one of several " @entity64 " that illustrate @entity77 's complicated capital punishment system			2
some of them involve inmates who faced possible execution until higher courts stepped in			0
convicted of murder , @entity183 spent 30 years behind bars in @entity186 despite seemingly overwhelming evidence that he was innocent			0
more on @entity183 's case in another case , @entity190 's lawyers found a previously unknown letter written by a key witness to a prosecutor in her murder trial			0
federal appellate judge @entity196 said the letter made the witness 's testimony worthless and ordered @entity200 freed			0
@entity200 had lost 17 years of her life during her prison ordeal			0
more on @entity200 's case @entity206 prisoner @entity205 spent more than 20 years on death row until a judge dismissed all charges against him because @entity205 's lawyers were not allowed access to evidence that could have proved him innocent			2
more on @entity205 's case in @entity216 , @entity214 , convicted of murder , was freed after lawyers uncovered previously unknown evidence that a witness had wrongly identified him as the killer			2
in 2008 , @entity214 made legal history when he won a $ 14 million award from a civil lawsuit against the @entity226 district attorney 's office , alleging @entity228 ' wrongful conviction had resulted from prosecutorial misconduct			0
but the case was appealed to the @entity77 @entity76 , where the award was denied in a 5 - 4 decision			0
more on @entity214 's case other " @entity64 " focus on prisoners who remain on death row for crimes that still have many unanswered questions			2
one such case involves former @entity240 police officer @entity239 , who faces execution for the rape and strangling death of an 11 - year - old girl			2
his lawyers are hoping for a new evidence hearing that they feel could result in his freedom			0
more on @entity239 's case another @entity240 prisoner , @entity250 , spent 15 years on death row for the murders of two business partners			2
@entity250 has claimed innocence -- and an alibi -- since the beginning			0
in november , at a @entity259 evidence hearing , defense attorneys blamed the killings on hit men directed by notorious drug lord @entity262			0
a judge eventually is expected to rule on the new evidence			0
more on @entity250 's case in perhaps the most bizarre case of the series , former army master sgt. @entity265 awaits execution on the @entity77 military 's death row at @entity271 , @entity272 , for a triple murder in which he was convicted , then acquitted and then convicted again			1
" @entity265 is the only person in @entity77 history who 's been tried for his life three times after guilty and not guilty verdicts , " said @entity274 , whose book " @entity276 " was made into a 1996 tv movie			0
despite @entity265 ' ultimate conviction , crime scene evidence still sheds doubt on the verdict , including still unidentified dna which was found under a victim 's fingernails			0
more on @entity265 ' case			0
