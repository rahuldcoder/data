@entity0 -- a federal appeals court ruled friday the @entity3 can still use full - body scanners at airports , but said the agency erred in how it deployed the controversial machines			1
a privacy group , the @entity8 , had sued the @entity3 claiming the machines violated @entity11 protections against unreasonable searches			1
the group further argued that the @entity3 did not follow the required procedures before making significant policy changes , such as subjecting travelers to the full - body scanners			1
the three - judge panel of the @entity19 in @entity0 rejected the first argument , concluding that there was no violation on constitutional grounds			2
but they agreed on the second point , saying @entity3 must now go through proper procedures -- though the court , significantly , did not order the agency to stop using the machines immediately			1
there is an " obvious need for the @entity3 to continue its airport security operations without interruption , " the judges ruled			2
either side can appeal to the full appeals court or the @entity37			1
but another , more likely scenario is that @entity3 , which is part of the @entity40 , will go through the public comment and rule - making process			1
the agency 's decision following that process could then become the basis for future lawsuits			0
" this is not over by any means , " said @entity48 , executive director of the @entity8			0
@entity3 officers operate more than 500 of the body imaging machines , which can see through clothes and reveal concealed objects , including bombs and bomb components			1
@entity3 plans to have more than 1,000 machines in use at airports nationwide by the end of this year			2
passengers are not required to submit to the scans , and may opt for pat - downs			0
but , the court noted , " many passengers ... remain unaware of this right , and some who have exercised the right have complained that the resulting pat - down was unnecessarily aggressive			2
" the @entity8 argued that the scanners violate passengers ' fourth amendment rights because , the group claimed , the search is more invasive than necessary to detect weapons or explosives			2
but the court said the government must weigh " the degree to which ( the search ) intrudes upon an individual 's privacy and ... the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests			0
" " the balance clearly favors the government here , " the court said			0
yet the judges took a swipe at the @entity3 's argument that its plans to implement the technology did not merit a formal public comment and rule - making process			1
" it is clear that by producing an image of the unclothed passenger , an ( @entity98 ) scanner intrudes upon his or her personal privacy in a way a magnetometer does not , " the court noted			0
the court also debunked the privacy group 's allegation in its lawsuit that @entity3 had violated the @entity111			1
the judges also labeled as " silly " the claim that the federal agency is not engaged in law enforcement			0
the @entity3 said in a statement that it is reviewing the ruling			0
@entity48 , meanwhile , called the court 's decision important and said it " pins " down @entity3 to a policy in which body scans are optional			1
privacy advocates had worried the use of scanners could become mandatory , as they become more ubiquitous at airports			0
" i think the court would have had a very different conclusion " had body scans been mandatory , @entity48 said .			0

a @entity132 appeals court weighs in on a lawsuit against the @entity3 over full - body scanners
the panel rules the machines do *n't* violate protections against unreasonable searches
judges find the @entity3 did not go through the right process before deploying the machines
