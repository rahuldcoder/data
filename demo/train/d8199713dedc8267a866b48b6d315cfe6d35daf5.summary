-- @entity1 came into the @entity2 with his air of invincibility punctured by recent defeats but his beaten opponent thursday -- @entity8 hopeful @entity7 -- believes the eight - time champion is still the man to beat at this year 's @entity2			1
the 20 - year - old @entity7 admits @entity1 was " one of his idols " growing up but showed little sign of being overawed as he detained the top seed for over two hours on @entity12 before succumbing to a 6 - 2 6 - 2 6 - 3 defeat in their second round match			1
but @entity7 , the youngest man in the top 100 of the world rankings , currently occupying 57th spot , saw enough in @entity1 's game to predict he will be holding the @entity21 aloft on sunday week			1
" i think here in @entity23 there are only a few man who can beat him , but yes he is the biggest favorite , " @entity7 told @entity0			2
@entity1 suffered shock quarterfinal defeats in @entity29 , @entity30 and in last week 's @entity32 final to @entity33 , but @entity7 believes he is an altogether different proposition at the clay court grand slam			2
" he 's in his element at his favorite venue and he 's really pumped up , " he said			0
" his top spin is really tough to counter and he did n't make a lot of mistakes			0
" after his victory , @entity1 was also full of praise for his young opponent and applauded him off the court			0
" he has completely everything to become a champion , " he predicted			0
" he as able to hit the ball very strong from the backhand and the forehand			0
" @entity7 , who beat @entity52 champion @entity51 in the second round of the @entity54 earlier this year , admitted to " feeling a little bit nervous " as he walked out on to the center court at a grand slam for the first time , " but fortunately i made a good start which helped a bit , " he added			1
he will now head to @entity61 in @entity62 to get grass court preparation ahead of @entity64 , while @entity1 will next play @entity65 of @entity66 in the third round , seeking the 61st victory of his record breaking career at the @entity2			2
even though he was expected to overcome @entity7 , @entity1 must have been slightly relieved as several big names have exited the tournament already			1
they include women 's number one and defending champion , @entity76 , second - seed @entity77 and @entity51 -- the man @entity1 lost to in the @entity52 final			1
elsewhere , @entity64 champion @entity80 , and 2013 finalist @entity81 , advanced with straight sets wins in the men 's draw			1
@entity80 led @entity1 by a break in the third set at the @entity32 earlier this month , only for the 13 - time grand slam winner to rally			2
they could meet again in the semifinals in @entity90 , although @entity80 must first get past @entity91 in the next round			0
@entity91 won a clay - court title last weekend in his native @entity94 and crushed the @entity95 on clay in @entity29 in 2010 in their lone head - to - head			0
in the women 's tournament , fourth seed @entity99 of @entity100 , tipped by many for grand slam glory soon , beat @entity105 of @entity106 6 - 2 6 - 4			0
@entity109 sixth seed @entity107 , who could directly benefit from the loss of @entity77 in her section of the draw , continued her fine form in @entity90 with a 7 - 5 6 - 0 dismissal of @entity116 's @entity115			0
former world number one and @entity2 champion @entity117 also went though while @entity119 kept @entity121 hopes high in the absence of the defeated @entity76 with a 6 - 1 6 - 3 victory over @entity124 of @entity125 .			1

defending champion @entity1 beats @entity7 at the @entity2
@entity1 eases past the promising @entity8 in straight sets at @entity23
there were also victories for @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity107
the tournament has already lost @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity51
