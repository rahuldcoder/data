-- @entity1 left us with great memories after five years on " @entity4 , " but the pressure was on for his first time hosting " @entity7 " on monday			1
yet at the end of the hour , we were left with a " @entity7 " that offered both surprising moments and big laughs , although it might 've included a lot more than we 'll see on an average night , since it was @entity13 's first show			1
@entity15 was the night 's guest , @entity14 provided some music , and house band the roots was as sharp as ever			1
( as @entity13 said during his opening monologue , they 're " the most talented band in all the land , " and he " could n't do the show " without them			0
) that alone was a set - up for a great show , but @entity13 also called on celebrity friends like @entity28 and @entity29 to help him get his version of " tonight " off to a good start			1
@entity1 's ' @entity7 ' debut : new show , same @entity1 the effort paid off , as early reviews have been quite positive , with @entity37 calling the show " vibrant and fresh " and @entity39 saying @entity13 was " easy to like			1
" @entity13 was a hit online as well , with tweet after tweet praising his performance , even from @entity46 fans : if you missed the premiere or want to relive some of the best moments , here are our five favorite scenes from @entity13 's first " @entity7			1
@entity15 and the " @entity53 " right away , it was clear that several of @entity13 's " @entity4 " staples were n't going anywhere , including his occasional " @entity58 " sketches			2
@entity13 's first guest , @entity15 , helped him during an " evolution of @entity62 " sketch , with both performers wearing ' 90s - style overalls and gamely showing off a number of hip - hop moves like the " @entity67 , " " @entity68 " and -- of course -- " the @entity70			1
" @entity15 was on fire during the whole episode			2
he later gave @entity13 some heartwarming words of wisdom : 2			0
a family affair @entity13 's dad , whom he jokingly referenced in his final " @entity4 " episode as being disappointed in him , showed up along with the 39 - year - old comedian 's mom			2
seeing his parents in the audience was a sweet moment for a guy who probably only dreamed he might ever host " @entity7 " as a kid			0
it was a nice way to start the show before getting into the typical monologue jokes			0
the parade of cameos moments after sitting down to his desk for the first time , @entity13 made reference to a " buddy " who owed him $ 100 after betting he would never host " @entity7			0
" the next thing you know , @entity100 ( @entity13 's first " @entity4 " guest ) showed up with a $ 100 bill			0
then @entity28 followed with yet another $ 100 bill			0
and then @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 ( not seen on " @entity7 " since the @entity112 years , when she was banned ) also showed up to slap down their @entity113			0
finally , @entity29 arrived with $ 100 in pennies , took a selfie and announced " welcome to 11:30 , b * * * h ! " it was a jaw - dropping moment to say the least , and we have to say we agree with this viewer : 4			0
@entity14 at the @entity121 all of these moments show how @entity13 is planning to make " @entity7 " his own , but none presented his perspective quite like having @entity14 perform on the roof of the @entity127			2
the band set up came even before @entity15 was officially brought out as the night 's guest			1
the sunset above the @entity132 skyline during @entity14 's performance looked beautiful , and it made for an original and unexpected moment			2
@entity14 , unplugged yep , @entity14 was so awesome on @entity13 's " tonight " that the band is taking up two moments on this list			1
@entity13 said that if he ever had them on the show , he 'd have them perform a song stripped down , with just acoustic guitars and @entity145 singing			0
on monday night , @entity14 did just that , performing the @entity150 - nominated " @entity149 " for the audience in a memorable , fitting end to the very first " @entity7 starring @entity1			1
" @entity13 's ' @entity7 ' : a throwback or new guard ?			0
