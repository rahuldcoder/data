@entity0 -- when @entity3 asked the @entity4 in 2011 to check out @entity5 because of his shift toward increasing @entity8 extremism , the bureau interviewed him and his family as part of a review that found no ties to terrorism			1
two years later , @entity5 , 26 , and his younger brother allegedly set off two bombs at the @entity16 that killed three people , then killed a university police officer and sparked a manhunt that paralyzed the city last week			2
now members of @entity22 want to know how someone who was brought to the attention of authorities and who exhibited increasingly radical leanings never came under further monitoring or questioning			0
@entity29 backs off @entity4 criticism over bombing suspect sen. @entity32 announced monday that the @entity33 she heads will look into the @entity4 's handling of @entity5			1
the hearing with @entity4 intelligence officials , expected to be closed to the public and media , could happen as soon as tuesday , said @entity32 , @entity39			1
a look at @entity5 's past an aide to the @entity43 said its chairman , @entity44 rep. @entity44 of @entity46 , also intended for the panel to examine the issue			2
the @entity5 case raised questions about the efficiency of overall security efforts , particularly involving people brought to the attention of federal authorities			2
@entity5 , who died after a shootout with police on thursday night , was an immigrant from the volatile @entity58 of southwest @entity3 who had legal residence in the @entity61 and sought last year to become fully naturalized , like his brother @entity62 , 19			1
bombing suspect 's wife ' very distraught ' however , the @entity65 rejected the citizenship request due to his past questioning by the @entity4 before a trip to @entity3			1
an @entity4 statement said a foreign government -- later identified by legislators as @entity3 -- asked for information on @entity5 " was based on information that he was a follower of radical @entity8 and a strong believer , and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the @entity61 for travel to the country 's region to join unspecified underground groups			1
" in response , the @entity4 said , it " checked @entity61 government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications , possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity , associations with other persons of interest , travel history and plans , and education history			2
" " the @entity4 also interviewed @entity5 and family members , " it said in the statement on friday			1
" the @entity4 did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011			2
" in addition , the @entity4 " requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government , " its statement said			0
that failed to satisfy @entity32 and other legislators			2
" i have asked the staff director of @entity111 this morning to set a hearing , particularly with @entity4 intelligence , " @entity32 told @entity1 on monday , adding she hoped for answers about what @entity5 did during the trip			1
what was @entity5 doing in @entity3 ? " and when he came back to this country , why did n't it ring a bell with the @entity4 intelligence unit that he should be checked out and vetted again ? " she asked			1
@entity32 also noted that @entity65 officials later denied @entity5 's application for citizenship , raising another question about who knew what about him			1
the purpose of the hearing was " not to criticize , because i am a big fan of the @entity4 's , but to go back and see that we plug loopholes , " @entity32 said			1
timeline : a look at @entity5 's past @entity5 , who 's ethnically @entity132 but came to the @entity61 from @entity133 , spent six months in @entity3 , causing some legislators and analysts to speculate he may have received training during the trip			1
conservative sen. @entity29 , who said sunday the @entity4 may have dropped the ball in its investigation of @entity5 , began easing off that claim on monday			1
the @entity142 @entity141 confirmed he talked to the assistant director of the @entity4 and learned how the bureau interviewed @entity5 , his parents and classmates in 2011			1
" they put his name through the system and they sent back this information to the @entity3 and said , ' do you have anything else ? ' and they never got a reply back , " @entity29 said			0
@entity29 also noted that @entity5 was n't flagged upon returning from @entity3 because of an apparent misspelling of his name by the @entity3 airline @entity156			1
" it did n't get into the system because of a misspelling , " @entity29 said			0
" now whether or not he intentionally changed his name or @entity156 just got the spelling wrong , i do n't know			0
that 's to be determined			0
" as for apparent warning signs that occurred within the last year , such as @entity164 postings of radical @entity8 , @entity29 said the @entity4 told him " they have limitations on what they can do			2
" dead @entity170 bomb suspect posted video of jihadist , analysis shows " so maybe it 's the system failed , did n't provide the @entity4 with the tools , or maybe they did n't use it properly , " he added			2
" that 's why maybe we need to find out what happened			0
" his comments sounded similar to those made by @entity183 chairman @entity182 , who defended the @entity4 on sunday			0
@entity182 told @entity184 the agency " did their due diligence " but @entity3 authorities " stopped cooperating " when the @entity61 sought further clarification			0
@entity182 also said he believed @entity5 may have traveled overseas using an alias			2
@entity1 law enforcement analyst @entity191 , a former @entity4 official , said there was little the bureau could do once @entity3 failed to respond to its request for further details			1
5 key questions " if they do n't give you more , then everything that can be done has been done unless you know that there should be more to the story , " @entity191 said			0
he detailed how the @entity4 employs what amounts to " triage " to deal with what he said were tens of thousands of similar inquiries a year that require some level of bureau investigation			1
" if you are getting this from a hot place like @entity212 or the tribal area of @entity214 or places where we have had specific training camps and people deployed on purpose to come and attack us , then that is the highest priority , " he said			0
" and even there , many of the people that go back and forth are visiting family			0
i mean , they are not always going back to be trained to be terrorists or always going back for refresher courses on terrorism			0
" regarding @entity3 , @entity191 noted the ongoing conflict with @entity132 separatists that may have caused @entity231 's request for information on @entity5			1
@entity233 : what we know about @entity236 " that 's been an ongoing fight , but it 's been localized , " he said , adding that he could n't recall a case in which a @entity236 trained at home came to attack the @entity61			0
however , @entity191 noted that @entity242 had sent people to the @entity58 for training that included bomb building			0
now @entity61 investigators need to find out if the @entity250 " had connections , were they deployed by a bigger group , and are there other terrorists in the @entity61 , " @entity191 said			0
" are there other explosive devices hidden somewhere or booby traps created , a cache of weapons ? " he wondered			0
" that 'll be the task			0
" @entity259 : suspects ' culture of migration and machismo @entity1 's @entity264 contributed to this report .			0
