-- thirty years ago around this time of the year , scientists announced that the probable cause of @entity3 had been found			1
human immunodeficiency virus , or @entity5 , would subsequently enter our lexicon and become synonymous -- no matter where you lived -- with death			1
since then , more than 75 million people have acquired @entity5 and nearly 35.6 million have died of @entity3 - related illnesses			1
with no cure in sight , it seemed that ending this epidemic would be a sisyphean task			0
but investments in aids research , prevention and treatment have yielded tremendous dividends			1
as a result , we have before us the opportunity to end one of the greatest public health crises in history			1
more people than ever are receiving life - saving antiretroviral therapy , and are living healthier , longer lives			0
there have been historic declines in @entity3 - related deaths worldwide			1
from 1996 to 2012 , antiretroviral therapy averted 6.6 million aids - related deaths , including 5.5 million in developing countries			1
the annual number of new hiv infections has also dropped by 33 % since 2001			0
in 26 countries , the rate of new hiv infections among young people ( ages 15 - 24 ) decreased by 50 % since 2001			0
for the first time , we have the ability to end the transmission from mother to child and to keep mothers alive			0
merely a decade ago , few believed they would see a cure in their lifetimes			0
however , several people who have been cured have helped shine a light on how a cure for all could be found			0
the case of a @entity60 patient , the first person to be cured of @entity5 , was reported in 2008 and represented a watershed moment in hiv research and a proof of principle that a cure was possible			1
last year , researchers documented the case of the first child to be functionally cured of @entity5			2
yet despite these promising developments , the epidemic is far from over			0
we are one year away from the target date for achieving universal access to hiv prevention , treatment and care set forth in the @entity78 2011 @entity77 on @entity3 , and we have a lot of work to do to meet that goal			1
of the 35.3 million people living with @entity5 , nearly two out of three living in developing countries are not on @entity5 treatment , either because they do not have access or do not know their @entity5 status			2
scaling up access to @entity5 treatment remains an essential prerequisite for ending @entity3			1
in addition to saving lives , it has proven to be highly effective at preventing @entity5 transmission because treatment reduces the chance the virus can spread by 96 %			2
we must also improve our health systems to support the scale - up of core interventions that we know work , including expanded access to hiv prevention and treatment , prevention of mother - to - child transmission of @entity5 , harm reduction , and voluntary medical male circumcision			1
effective outreach to those most at risk — and most in need — is also critical			0
key populations , including sex workers , men who have sex with men , transgender individuals , people who inject drugs , young girls and women often face substantial barriers to obtaining prevention , treatment and care services			0
as a result , efforts to reduce @entity5 transmission among vulnerable populations remain insufficient			1
moving forward , research on a cure and vaccine remains essential and must be a priority			2
the quest for a safe and effective vaccine to prevent @entity5 has seen hopeful signs of progress			2
recently , an experimental vaccine " cleared " @entity5 in monkeys infected with the virus			2
broadly neutralizing antibodies that protect against a wide range of strains of @entity5 have been discovered			2
experts are following up the @entity141 trial in @entity142 , the first vaccine to show a modest protective effect in humans , in order to understand why some people were more protected than others and how to make the protective effect last longer			0
@entity5 cure research has gained momentum and picked up speed			1
the first organization to aggressively pursue cure - focused @entity5 research , @entity155 , @entity156 , has intensified its cure research program and set a goal to find a broadly applicable cure for @entity5 by 2020 with its " @entity161 " initiative			1
the foundation plans to invest $ 100 million in cure research over the next six years			1
and on @entity164 last december , president @entity163 announced $ 100 million in reprioritized funding over the next three years to launch a new hiv @entity166 at the @entity167			0
the scientific obstacles to a cure have been illuminated , and with a vigorous research effort and sufficient investment , these challenges can be overcome			2
while we now have the tools to begin to end the @entity5 epidemic , achieving an @entity3 - free generation is threatened by a considerable gap between available resources and the amounts needed to scale up high - impact interventions			1
investing now in these interventions will not only accelerate progress in reducing @entity3 - related deaths and new hiv infections , but it will also lower the long - term cost of the @entity5 response			1
strong , continuous @entity187 leadership at this critical moment is key			0
innovative financing options and strategies need to be explored to ensure that the global @entity5 response is sustained			2
@entity192 supports many countries in developing @entity5 investment cases , which enable countries to estimate future resource gaps , identify new sources of domestic financing to help close the gaps , and agree on ways to enhance the efficiency and impact of spending			2
more than 30 countries are now planning to develop their own investment cases by the end of this year			0
lastly , we must eliminate stigma , discrimination and punitive laws and practices that continue to undermine efforts to provide critical services to prevent and treat @entity5 , especially among vulnerable populations			1
we 're seeing a growing conservatism in a growing number of regions and countries			0
state - sanctioned homophobia in many countries remains a formidable barrier to the implementation and uptake of @entity5 programs			1
more than 80 countries criminalize homosexual behavior			0
the anti-homosexuality laws that have gone into effect in @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 , for example , could impede their national responses to @entity5			0
studies have clearly shown that criminalizing same - sex sexual behavior poses an immense structural barrier to hiv prevention			0
we all are stakeholders in the opportunity before us now			0
addressing the unfinished business of ending the pandemic will require the cooperation and full commitment of national government leadership , scientists , civil society , and people living with @entity5			0
but through continued and strengthened solidarity , we will be able to rise above the challenges that remain ahead to ultimately achieve the goal of an @entity3 - free generation .			1

@entity255 , @entity256 : today , we still do *n't* have a cure for @entity3
@entity255 , @entity259 : we can end one of the greatest public health crises in history
they say that we have to intensify our efforts on @entity5 cure research
@entity255 , @entity259 : the goal of an aids - free generation is within our reach
