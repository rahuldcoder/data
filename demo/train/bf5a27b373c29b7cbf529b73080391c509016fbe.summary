@entity1 , @entity0 -- when powerlifting coach @entity4 wanted to create a winning formula for her athletes , she did n't head to the weight room			2
instead , she found herself in the classroom			0
coach @entity4 with athletes from @entity11 's powerlifting team			2
head coach of @entity11 's powerlifting squad , @entity12 participated in a course that 's designed to boost the leadership and management skills of coaches			1
@entity12 's responsibilities run the gamut from identifying up - and - coming talent to developing training programs			2
she had friends who were corporate performance directors , and realizing the skills they had were applicable to her own line of work , she decided to pursue a professional development course designed for coaches			1
" we expect athletes to be the best they can be			0
our responsibility as coaches is to be the best we can be , " @entity12 told @entity2			2
in pursuit of becoming better managers and leaders , players in the business world have long turned to executive education programs			1
elite coaches are taking a cue from business and turning to tailored programs too			1
in the run up to the @entity47 in @entity1 , the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the @entity48 , said @entity49 of @entity50 , where @entity12 took the coaching course			1
" a lot of coach development work [ in the @entity48 ] is ad hoc			1
it 's becoming more clearly defined , but our vision is to establish a more development pathway for coaches , " he told @entity2			1
@entity12 trains about 20 powerlifters as part of a program that was established to prepare athletes in @entity11 for major competitive events like the @entity47 and @entity65			2
nutritionists , psychologists , fitness coaches and sports scientists are all focused on a goal of helping athletes achieve a performance edge , she says			2
but coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes			2
that requires a broad range of skills , from understanding the athlete experience and identifying particular challenges they may encounter as well as having a firm understanding of where funding comes from and making sure it 's spent wisely " we prepare our athletes to be the best in the world			1
but we also have to make sure that we are making the best choices for them , " she said			0
@entity94 , which specializes in customized education programs , has been running sport coaching courses since 2001			0
its core world class sport coach development program is endorsed by the @entity100			1
the course is made up of 10 one - day master classes that are spread out over a period of about 10 months			0
in a typical meeting , coaches are given scenarios , break up into groups for discussion and then present their responses to the class			0
the program is flexible so coaches can focus on the skills they want to improve			1
a wide range of topics are covered , from communication , negotiation and team building skills to body language , motivation and development of young players			1
@entity49 estimates that about 160 coaches have completed the coaching program since it was launched			1
most participants are @entity48 - based , but coaches come from around the world and represent a long list of sports that includes diving , swimming , rugby , hockey , shooting and cricket			1
coaches have few opportunities to share their knowledge			0
according to @entity49 , that 's one reason why the course has been popular			0
one measure of its success : many coaches , like @entity12 , participate more than once			0
due to a lack of funding , however , coaches oftentimes end up paying for the course themselves			0
@entity94 heavily subsidizes the program and charges Â£ 2,000 , just about a quarter of what it actually costs to run it			1
but in return , the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs , @entity49 said			0
elite coaches have a lot to offer companies , especially in the current economic downturn , @entity49 said			1
more businesses are under pressure to maximize efficiency , and many want to learn from the sport experience , since coaches are required to achieve results quickly			1
with 2012 less than three years away , @entity12 is planning to return to @entity94 for a refresher			0
she says one of the advantages of the program is that it helps coaches deal with pressure by teaching them how to cope with and embrace change			2
that 's an invaluable skill in athletics			0
" sport is change , " she said			0
" you 're only as good as your last competition or as strong as your weakest link			0
you have to move forward and constantly evolve			0

with 2012 games approaching , focus on coach development on the rise in @entity48
elite coaches turn to program run by @entity50 to build skills
course designed to transfer lessons from business world to sport
