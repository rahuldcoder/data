@entity0 -- the @entity2 on monday opened what is expected to be a lengthy and rancorous debate on a sweeping bill to overhaul the nation 's health care system			1
in statements laced with heated and conflicting rhetoric , @entity8 and @entity9 outlined opposing positions on the 2,074 - page @entity14 measure that would provide health insurance to an additional 31 million people at a cost of almost $ 850 billion			1
democrats led by senate majority leader @entity19 of @entity20 framed the debate as historic and said the bill would provide vital health insurance for almost all @entity23 , hold down spiraling costs that threaten the @entity23 economy and instill needed reforms to ensure the long - term solvency of the government - run @entity29 health program for senior citizens			1
" in the greatest country on @entity41 , no @entity23 should die simply because they do n't have health insurance , " said sen. @entity32 of @entity33 , one of the bill 's architects , while @entity19 said the bill " saves money , saves lives and saves @entity29			1
" republicans countered that the bill was too big , too expensive and would cause more harm than good			2
sen. @entity46 of @entity47 called it a " sham " and a " 2,074 - page monstrosity full of measures that would impair the abilities , particularly of our senior citizens , to keep the benefits they 've been promised			0
" @entity46 immediately proposed sending the bill back to committee to remove all provisions intended to bring down the costs of @entity29			2
he cited proposed cuts to @entity29 , including $ 118 billion in subsidies provided to private insurers for @entity63 -- an enhanced benefits program for senior citizens			2
" there is no math , old or new , that gets you to no change in the benefits they have under @entity63 and yet cuts $ 120 billion , " @entity46 said			0
a vote on @entity46 's proposal was likely on tuesday			0
the @entity74 has passed its version of a health care bill , and if the @entity2 passes its bill , the two measures would be merged by a congressional conference committee			1
both chambers then would have to approve the revised bill before it could go to president @entity83 's desk			0
on monday , debate quickly bogged down in @entity9 procedural objections , causing @entity19 to lament : " this is not a good way to start this debate			1
" @entity9 sen. @entity89 of @entity90 challenged a motion by @entity19 that he said would unfairly cut off the proposal of amendments , including @entity46 's planned @entity9 amendment to prevent cuts to @entity29			1
while @entity19 's motion failed , @entity89 labeled it a stunt			0
so far , @entity9 unanimously oppose the health care bill			1
the @entity2 voted 60 - 39 to launch debate on the measure , overcoming a @entity9 filibuster through support from every member of the @entity14 caucus			1
@entity19 also will need 60 votes to eventually close the debate , and his ability to secure that support remains uncertain			0
the debate will feature amendments intended to delete or change controversial provisions , including creation of a government - run public health insurance option to compete against private insurers , tax increases and provisions intended to prevent federal tax dollars from paying for abortion except in cases of rape , incest or danger to the mother 's life			2
for the most part , battle lines are clearly drawn			0
@entity127 - minded senators such as @entity128 of @entity129 , an independent who sits with the @entity14 caucus , favor a public option as the best way to force competition on private insurers to bring down costs , while fiscally conservative @entity8 such as @entity135 's @entity134 are concerned about the cost and scope of a government - run alternative			2
@entity134 has said he would join a @entity9 filibuster against closing debate on the bill if it retains the current public option provision , which allows states to opt out of a national plan			2
another @entity14 caucus member , independent @entity146 of @entity147 , says he also will prevent a final vote if the bill contains any form of public option			0
on the @entity9 side , none of the 40 senators supports a public option , but one -- moderate @entity156 of @entity157 -- has discussed a trigger mechanism that would automatically bring a public option if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet			2
the trigger idea is considered the lone chance of a compromise that could gain the support of any @entity9			2
for @entity8 , each vote is crucial			0
overcoming a filibuster requires support every member of the @entity14 caucus , so if @entity146 or others oppose a public option , @entity19 would need a @entity9 senator to switch sides on the bill			1
@entity8 concede that some changes are necessary to get the health care bill passed			1
they contend their comprehensive approach is necessary to reform a system in which higher costs are draining the national economy and harming businesses and individuals			0
@entity9 call for an incremental approach that they say would reduce the costs of health care without needing to create bureaucracies and raise taxes in a huge overhaul			1
other risky issues for @entity8 include abortion and tax increases to pay for health care reform			1
the bill includes tax increases aimed at those earning more than $ 200,000 a year and insurers providing so - called " @entity201 " health plans worth more than $ 8,500 a year for individuals or $ 23,000 for families			0
it also would set a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery			0
in contrast , a separate health care bill narrowly passed by the @entity74 earlier this month includes an income tax surcharge on individuals earning more than $ 500,000 a year and couples making more than $ 1 million			1
@entity9 say any tax increase is bad in a struggling economy because it hinders growth and gets passed on to consumers , while democrats argue the bill 's tax provisions would n't hit the lower or middle class and would create incentive for private insurers to lower the cost of policies			2
however , a key @entity14 constituency -- organized labor -- opposes taxing the " @entity201 " health plans negotiated for workers in lieu of wage increases			0
on abortion , the @entity74 bill has more restrictive language regarding the use of federal funding , and some @entity8 say they oppose adding it to their chamber 's proposal			1
according to the nonpartisan @entity237 , the @entity2 health care bill would reduce the federal deficit by about $ 130 billion over the next 10 years , through 2019			1
any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be " subject to substantial uncertainty , " but probably would result in " small reductions in federal budget deficits , " the budget office report said			0
it also reported that health insurance premiums would remain roughly the same for most people , with costs for lower - income @entity23 reduced due to subsidies under the plan			0
according to the budget office , more than 80 percent of @entity23 would remain in employer - based health plans			0
both the @entity2 and @entity74 bills would require individuals to buy health insurance , with penalties for noncompliance			1
unlike the @entity74 version , the @entity2 bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care			1
the two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes , including creating health insurance exchanges , expanding @entity268 , subsidizing insurance for low - and some middle - income families , and capping out - of - pocket medical expenses , while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
@entity1 's @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report			0

process quickly gets caught up in procedural objections from @entity9
@entity90 senator protests proposal over amendments to bill
republicans , @entity8 continue to square off over @entity29
@entity74 has already passed health care bill that *differs* with @entity2 bill
