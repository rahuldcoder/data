-- the 2014 @entity2 nominations were announced on thursday , with " @entity3 " in the lead with a total of 19 nods , and " @entity9 " getting its final round of recognition			1
the announcement , made by @entity11 and " @entity13 's " @entity12 , revealed strong competition but few surprises , with series like " true detective " and " @entity18 " getting their expected ( and deserved ) due			1
here 's what else we learned from the 2014 emmy nominations ( see the list of nominations here ) : 1			1
so many dramas , so little room this year 's drama category name - checks some of the predicted suspects -- " @entity9 , " " @entity30 , " " @entity31 " -- while welcoming a new player : @entity33 's " true detective			1
" the show 's inclusion in the category was controversial , since the program is structured more like a miniseries : its second season will tell a new story with a new cast of characters			1
but @entity33 submitted it as a drama , and @entity2 voters clearly responded -- evidently more than they did for " homeland , " the @entity44 series that was once the belle of the @entity2 ball			0
( last year , 13 nominations			1
this year ? a total of four			0
) yet even with such a strong cast of nominees , fans of " @entity54 , " the @entity55 " and " @entity58 " are somewhere bemoaning the @entity2 ' oversight of those series once again			0
@entity60 's seat at the table is a lock what a difference a year makes			2
with the @entity64 , @entity60 was the new kid on the block , breaking ground with its nominations for its shining original series , " @entity30			2
" but in 2014 , the streaming service has locked down 31 nominations , including a nod to @entity73 for outstanding lead actor in a comedy in his new show , " @entity77			1
plenty of fresh faces -- but where 's @entity80 ? with so many first - timers included in the @entity2 nominations this year , we would 've guessed that " @entity54 's " star @entity80 would 've been among them , for sure			1
but no , it looks like the talented actress -- who 's been receiving praise from the @entity88 to @entity89 to , yes , @entity0 -- has been passed over once again			2
@entity0 10 @entity90 : @entity80 and more here 's some good news , though : the @entity2 did n't forget " @entity92 " star @entity93 , or @entity94 ( " @entity3 " ) , or @entity95 and @entity96 ( " @entity18 " )			2
plus , newcomers like @entity99 's miniseries " @entity100 " got plenty of love : it was right behind " @entity3 " for most nominations , with 18			1
from the @entity104 to the @entity2 as if we needed more proof that some of the best work is being done on tv , two of the standout nominees this year are fresh off their stint at the @entity104 in march			0
@entity113 , who was nominated for best actor at the 2014 @entity104 for " 12 years a slave , " has picked up his first @entity2 nomination for the miniseries " @entity117			2
" and @entity122 , a.k.a. the guy who just won the best actor @entity104 with " @entity121 , " is nominated for an outstanding dramatic actor emmy with " true detective			0
" he 'll compete in that category with his co-star , @entity126 , but if @entity122 wins , he 'll become the first actor to win both an @entity104 and an @entity2 in the same year			0
the comedy nominees are no laughing matter " @entity135 " has been the favorite in the outstanding comedy series category for the past four years , but this year the @entity133 stalwart faces competition from both " @entity18 " and " @entity136 , " both of which have earned their fair share of applause			0
and when it comes to the best lead actress in a comedy , everyone 's hoping this will be @entity146 's year			0
the " @entity148 " star has done some invaluable work on the @entity151 series , and while she 's been nominated for her role as @entity153 four times before , she 's never won			0
while we 're talking about comedy , we have to give a tip of the hat to @entity158 : the " @entity160 " vet just took over " @entity161 " earlier this year , but he 's competing in the outstanding variety series category along with mainstays " @entity164 " and " @entity165			0
" the 2014 @entity2 will be hosted by " @entity167 's " @entity166 , and will air live on @entity151 august 25 at 8 p.m. et / 5 p.m. pt. emmy nominations : snubs that made you turn off your tv			1
