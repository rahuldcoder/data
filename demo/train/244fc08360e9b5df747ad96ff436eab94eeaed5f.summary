" nobody builds a metro in two years , " she said on the a terrace of the presidential residence , @entity22 , designed by renowned @entity1 architect @entity23			0
of the 143 billion reais ( $ 63 billion ) earmarked for infrastructure projects , only 8 to 9 billion reais were meant to be used specifically during the @entity5			1
" the rest is n't for the @entity5 , it 's for @entity1 , " she said			1
with the june 12 kickoff just around the corner , @entity1 has seen a series of protests and strikes against @entity5 projects , as well as criticism over construction delays and cost overruns			1

when asked whether she thought it was a mistake to host @entity5 matches in 12 different cities instead of the minimum eight cities required by @entity75 , @entity3 said the international football association chose the cities and added that now was not the time to ask what could have been done differently			2
@entity75 has always said @entity1 insisted on the 12 cities to ensure the whole country was involved in the @entity5			2
it 's a delicate moment for @entity3 , who will run for a second term in october 's presidential elections			2
for many @entity1 , the success of the @entity5 and even of the @entity1 team are tied up with her electoral prospects			2
@entity3 is the favorite , but her margin has steadily declined , making it highly likely that there will be a runoff vote			0
a survey released tuesday by the @entity94 found 72 % of @entity1 were " dissatisfied with the way things are going in their country " and 61 % said they thought hosting the @entity5 " was a bad thing " because it took money away from schools , health care and other public services			1
