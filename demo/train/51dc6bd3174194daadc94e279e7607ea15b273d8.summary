-- people are interesting , so if you talk to enough people , you 're bound to learn interesting things			2
that 's the fortune - cookie version of @entity0 's philosophy when it comes to comments			1
@entity0 gets thousands of comments on its stories every day			1
they can be thought - provoking , vulgar , inspiring , offensive or hilarious , but they 're rarely boring			0
our audience makes valuable contributions to @entity0 's coverage by giving us a broader view of the day 's events			1
our health unit recently published a story about phobias that referenced actress @entity23 's fear of snakes and quoted a @entity26 woman with a fear of vomit			0
it 's an interesting story and dozens of people jumped in to discuss their fears of sharks , heights , crowds , blood and even wet paper			0
that conversation gave an even better understanding of a problem that affects more than 19 million @entity41 adults			0
we also read through the comments to see which stories are generating buzz and deserve follow - ups , and to look for new story ideas and fresh angles			1
it 's not all rainbows and unicorns and people can be mean , but we have moderators and other mechanisms in place to help keep things civil			1
you can check out our @entity57 to get the full list of what is and what is n't allowed on @entity0 , but the short version is that we encourage lively discussions and spirited debate			1
we do n't want comments that are abusive , vulgar , defamatory or obscene			2
our moderators can remove comments that violate our guidelines and block users who have a pattern of bad behavior			2
we 've also given you the power to report abuse when you see comments you think are inappropriate			0
it 's an evolving system and we spend a lot of time in the newsroom discussing the right approach for delicate stories			0
are racial slurs ok in a story about racist language ? is it appropriate to allow comments calling for terrorists , rapists and serial killers to be killed in the most violent way possible ? or how explicit is too explicit in a story about sex ? a recent health story about the female g - spot sparked a particularly frank debate			0
we 're always looking for new ways to highlight user comments on @entity0 and to make participating in the discussion more rewarding			1
if you 've got a suggestion , please let us know in the comments .			0
