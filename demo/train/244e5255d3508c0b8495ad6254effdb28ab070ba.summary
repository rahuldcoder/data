space travelers , get ready for a new ride			0
the @entity2 got its grand reveal thursday night by @entity5 founder @entity4 , who showed off his company 's new spacecraft in a live webcast			1
while the @entity10 - based company has already made its mark on its industry in its 12 years in business , @entity2 marks a major milestone as @entity5 's first spacecraft capable of bringing humans to the @entity17 then taking them back to @entity18			1
" it 's all around i think a big leap forward in technology , " @entity4 said			1
" it really takes things to the next level			0
" the storied entrepreneur -- who also founded the @entity27 car company and whose personality is thought by some to be the inspiration for @entity31 's take on @entity32 , or " @entity32 , " in recent movies -- said that " @entity35 2 , " as he called it , can transport as many as seven astronauts for several days			2
one big upgrade from earlier models is that @entity2 will be reusable , which will cut down on costs and open up opportunities for humans to explore			2
thanks to propulsion and other technology to slow its re-entry into @entity18 's orbit and control its descent , @entity4 said the spacecraft should be able to land most anywhere much like a helicopter			1
" as long as we continue to throw away rockets and spacecraft , we will never have true access to space , " @entity4 explained			1
" it will always be incredibly expensive			0
" there are a series of back - up systems as well			0
that includes the recently unveiled @entity61 engine , two of which will be in each @entity2			2
with 16,000 pounds of thrust , these engines will help allow the capsule to safely land			0
if one stops working , the other can take over ; if both stop , a parachute can be deployed to allow astronauts to float safely back down to @entity18			1
as evidenced by the fact it is " @entity72 , " the new spacecraft builds off existing technology developed by @entity5			1
already , @entity5 has embarked on three of its 12 scheduled missions to the @entity17 as part of its $ 1.6 billion contract with @entity78			1
that includes the first ever connection between that orbiter and a private spacecraft in 2012			0
but all its trips so far -- including back to @entity18 , when the @entity5 craft parachuted into the @entity86 -- involved only cargo and were unmanned			1
@entity2 aims to change that			0
thursday 's event included a dramatic unveiling of the new spacecraft , which stood about 15 feet tall , with a rounded , cone - shaped top			0
at one point , @entity4 even went inside and sat in one of its four reclined seats			0
while such an undertaking likely has been in the works for some time , it comes at a pivotal , uncertain time for the @entity17 and space travel , generally			2
@entity78 's agreement with @entity5 -- plus its $ 1.9 billion deal with @entity104 - based @entity103 for eight missions -- takes on increased importance given @entity109 deputy prime minister @entity108 's announcement earlier this month that his country does not plan to use the manned orbiter beyond 2020			1
that announcement as well as ratcheted - up tensions between @entity109 and the @entity114 has raised concerns about the space station 's future , especially since @entity109 @entity119 aircraft have become the only way astronauts have been able to get to - and - fro since the end of the @entity124 space shuttle program			2
this comes after president @entity126 , in 2010 , pushed for the expansion of private - sector and commercial space industries as part of his reimagining of the @entity124 space program			2
" we will actually reach space faster and more often under this plan , " @entity126 said , adding this approach would send more astronauts into space over the next decade than previously planned			0
" by the mid- 2030s , i believe we can send people to orbit @entity141 and bring them safely back to @entity18 , " group aims to send 2 humans near @entity141 yet @entity5 is n't alone in its ambition to ferry people into space			1
in addition to various efforts to take people to @entity141 -- including one from the @entity148 and the @entity149 , which has vowed to launch a spacecraft in 2018 with two humans heading toward the @entity141 -- @entity5 has competition in its efforts to go to the @entity17 as well			1
it is one of three private companies -- along with @entity158 and @entity159 -- who have completed the first step of @entity78 's certification process to haul astronauts to the space station , the space agency announced friday			1
@entity78 noted that it awarded $ 30 million contracts to all three companies along these lines in december 2012			0
" we 're making great strides toward returning human spaceflight launch capability to @entity124 soil , " @entity78 official @entity167 said in a press release friday			0
" this certification is important to ensuring our crew members have reliable transportation to and from the space station where they are conducting research essential to advancing human exploration farther into the solar system			0
" project : more than 100,000 want to go to @entity141			0

@entity78 : @entity5 is one of 3 private firms to pass first step in @entity78 program
@entity5 founder @entity4 unveils the @entity2 , his company 's latest spacecraft
@entity5 has flown several unmanned missions so far to the @entity17
the @entity2 is capable of carrying up to 7 people into space and then back to @entity18
