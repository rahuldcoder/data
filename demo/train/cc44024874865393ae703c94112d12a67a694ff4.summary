no , it 's not a neo-nazi convention			0
rather , it is a groundbreaking exhibit that opened friday in the @entity13 capital and is intended to show @entity3 's relationship with the @entity13 people			1
@entity13 has produced exhibits on the @entity17 and @entity18 before but never since @entity19 has one focused solely on the man who taught an entire nation to hate			1
" @entity3 and the @entity13 " is not about the fascist dictator 's memorabilia , not about the man himself , said curator @entity26			1
it 's not about textbook history or scholarly writings			0
the everyday objects on display show how @entity3 won the heart of the @entity13 people			1
everyone can read a book , but " objects have another quality , " @entity26 said			2
there are rows and rows of magazine covers carrying the face of @entity3 as well as enormous metal busts carved for industrial mantle pieces			1
and propaganda signs , welfare collection boxes , photographs , film footage promoting a visionary leader of the fatherland			2
@entity26 hopes viewers -- many of whom are sure to be @entity13 who no longer have direct memories of their nation 's ugly history -- will look inside themselves as they cast their eyes on ordinary things that back then , served a very extraordinary purpose			1
@entity60 of the @entity62 civil rights group the @entity61 , called the exhibit " extraordinary			2
" " it 's the ordinary objects -- that is what makes it powerful , " he said			1
they are disquieting , upsetting , even off - putting , he said			0
viewers might even go home and turn on a lamp in their living rooms and think about how the objects in the exhibit once occupied the same kinds of places			1
" it was n't just among a group of elites , " said said @entity60 , director of international affairs at the @entity61			0
" that @entity13 society was permeated with the symbols and the images that the regime was promoting was an important first step , and it took hold in a very frightening way			1
" more than 1,000 people streamed into the museum on opening day , @entity26 said			0
they walked through halls devoted to three chronologically and thematically arranged chapters showing the circumstances of @entity3 's rise and rule			1
swastikas are banned in @entity13 but @entity26 said museums have special permission to display them for historical purposes			1
still , organizers of the show agonized over possible repercussions : inciting neo-nazi extremists and infuriating the rest of the world			0
a new study published this week in the @entity13 magazine @entity110 revealed far - right thoughts are common in @entity13 today			1
one - third of @entity13 said they would send foreigners home if there were not enough jobs to go around			1
one - sixth of @entity13 said @entity62 have too much influence			2
" yes , we have had some objections , " @entity26 said			0
" one of the fears discussed in the newspapers is that this might promote extreme groups			0
but i am not sure they enter museums			0
" @entity60 said he did not believe an exhibit was likely to accelerate or motivate extreme viewpoints			2
" people who have a xenophobic view of their society are not going to be any less or more xenophobic because of this exhibit , " @entity60 said			2
@entity131 , a scholar of the @entity17 , also felt such exhibits are important			0
" you understand that these things did not come out of nothing , " said @entity131 , who teaches at @entity133 in @entity134 , @entity135			0
