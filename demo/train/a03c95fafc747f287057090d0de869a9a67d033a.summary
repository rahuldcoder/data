in recent years , the gaming industry has seen a number of hyped trends come and go : games on social networks , 3 - d gaming , systems that let you control in - game avatars by moving your body			1
now get ready for another one : virtual reality			1
this technology , which plunges headset wearers into three - dimensional virtual worlds that feel incredibly lifelike , is coming to consumers very soon , according to the two companies spearheading the charge			1
@entity18 and @entity19 have been developing prototypes for virtual - reality headsets that immerse people in scenarios as mundane as a boardroom or as fantastic as a medieval castle complete with dragons			1
but reps for both companies who spoke to @entity30 at last week 's @entity32 gaming show say the driving force behind the success or failure of virtual - reality , or @entity37 , will be not their devices but the games created for them			1
@entity18 ceo @entity40 said his team of " the brightest minds of the industry " has come a long way from two years ago , when a bulky @entity46 prototype held together by duct tape was shown to selected media at @entity32			1
" we 've tackled so many of the hardest problems , " @entity40 said last week			0
" we have 30 or 40 of these top talents all focusing on delivering the best @entity37 the world has ever seen			1
this is really delivering on something that people have imagined for so many years and we have n't gotten there yet			0
now we 're starting to get there			0
" meanwhile @entity58 , the code name for @entity19 's rival vr headset , was introduced in march as the future of gaming on the @entity64 system			1
indeed , the lightbar on the @entity67 's dualshock controller was designed with the @entity58 headgear in mind to allow the devices to be tracked together			0
according to @entity72 , @entity73 researcher and developer for @entity19 , the goal of @entity58 is to make players feel like they are inside the game			1
both @entity40 and @entity72 said they must resolve technical issues before their respective systems will be ready for consumer use			2
these problems , which they say are close to being solved , include more precise eye tracking and stopping motion blur			0
both @entity46 and @entity19 say they are close to releasing consumer units , but neither would provide a timetable			1
however , they agree the headsets are useless without great content			2
people wo n't want to buy a @entity37 headset if they ca n't use it for a compelling game			1
and these games need to be ready to go when the headsets hit the market			1
" we 're going to make a great piece of hardware that delivers on the promise of great @entity37 , " @entity40 said			1
" but it 's going to be up to content developers -- game developers -- to make great experiences			0
they can still make things terribly wrong			0
" it 's a big challenge , " he added			0
" @entity109 developers are just going to have to learn how to make great @entity37			1
" both @entity46 and @entity19 staged some early demos of their @entity37 technology to e3 attendees			1
the @entity18 offerings ranged from a @entity115 - type platform game to a matrix - style hallway shootout ( complete with dodging bullets ) to " alien : isolation , " a game in which you must avoid being killed by nasty space aliens			2
if you failed to elude your enemies in the " @entity124 " game , you ended up with a tail spike right through your chest			0
and yes , you could look down and see it as it happened			0
the @entity58 games were a bit tamer and definitely less bloody			0
a simple castle scenario let you use @entity134 controllers to grab medieval weapons and smack around a practice dummy			0
when the real fight began , the weapons disappeared and you were suddenly left going hand to hand with a dragon , with predictable results			0
a street - luge demo let players streak down a hillside while dodging traffic along the way			0
you could steer the luge by simply leaning left and right , and collisions merely slowed the player down instead of crashing them out of the game			0
@entity72 said there is a balance between what hardware developers want to deliver for @entity37 and game developers ' creative visions			2
he said @entity19 is experimenting with different types of games to find that sweet spot , but he admits he does n't know what it looks like yet			1
" there 's clearly games that work well , " he said during an @entity32 demo			1
" street luge was surprising			0
you 're traveling so fast , you 'd think someone would get really motion sick , but no one ever has			0
" @entity40 said @entity46 delivered 60,000 developer kits for the first version of its headset and will send another 40,000 for the second			2
with so many pieces of test hardware in the hands of creative people , finding that elusive game that can deliver on @entity37 's promise may be only a year or two away			2
@entity185 president @entity184 said independent game designers may be the key to reaching this goal , with an assist from @entity46			2
" we were n't able to provide many dev kits until after @entity190 , " @entity184 said , referring to the @entity190 three months ago			0
" but many developers , especially indie , already were working on something cool using @entity46			2
" the mathematics of developing games for @entity46 or @entity19 is pretty much the same , he said , meaning that game creators will easily be able to make entertainments for both headsets			1
@entity46 director of developer relations @entity202 said that as more people get their hands on @entity37 prototypes and discover what they can do , the more the industry sees the technology 's potential			1
" i like to give people about 15 minutes when they come out of it ( @entity37 ) , " @entity202 said			2
" they 're thrilled with the experience and they see where it is going , but then it takes some time for them to realize how it is going to change the world			0
and that 's what 's fun			0

makers of virtual - reality headsets say that games , not *consoles* will drive the @entity37 experience
@entity19 and @entity46 are the two early *leaders* in developing @entity37 systems
reps from both companies demoed their headsets at @entity32 , the gaming show
