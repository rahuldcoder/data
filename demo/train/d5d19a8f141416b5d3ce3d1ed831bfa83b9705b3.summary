@entity0 -- @entity2 on wednesday dispensed vouchers to passengers and some levity to the public , two days after one of its flight attendants famously quit following a luggage - bin altercation			1
perhaps realizing that the best answer to the public support of @entity14 might be humor , the company 's blog had a posting entitled , " sometimes the weird news is about us			1
" the blog read , " it would n't be fair for us to point out absurdities in other corners of the industry without acknowledging when it 's about us			1
well this week 's news certainly falls into that category			2
perhaps you heard a little story about one of our flight attendants ? " " while we ca n't discuss the details of what is an ongoing investigation , plenty of others have already formed opinions on the matter			2

they were shoving luggage around , " said @entity42 's attorney , @entity122			1

@entity122 said the female passenger said " f --- you " to @entity42			2
after the flight landed at @entity108 , @entity42 approached the female passenger who was retrieving her bag from the bin while the plane was still taxiing to the gate , according to a source familiar with the incident			1
passengers are required to stay in their seats with their seat belts fastened until the pilot has reached the gate and gives the all - clear sign			0
