a new @entity1 study shows that millennial women are entering the workplace at near wage parity , with the narrowest pay gap on record			1
millennial women like me are more likely to have graduated from college than their male counterparts			1
we have role models like @entity13 and new @entity15 ceo @entity14			0
today , there 's a much more open conversation about sexism and how it manifests than there was 10 years ago			0
and it 's no coincidence that a recent poll from @entity24 magazine found that 73 % of women voters under 30 identify as feminist			1
it would seem today 's young women are set for the post-feminist professional paradise dreamed up by our foremothers			2
but until women are paid the same as men , we will never be truly equal			1
in a capitalist society , money is the key indicator of worth			0
the wage gap has functioned across history to make women dependent on men as providers			1
we ca n't save as much for retirement , stash away cash to treat ourselves or even take care of our families in the way we want if we 're starting at a deficit			0
this is an issue of financial security for a generation already facing much more instability than our parents or grandparents			2
read : millennial women are closing pay gap , but pessimistic about workplace equality the @entity1 study found that an astounding 75 % of millennial women believe more changes are needed to combat gender inequality in the workplace			1
it makes sense , then , that these are the same young activists who have been working valiantly for the passage of the @entity66 and who see working - class heroine @entity68 as a more imitable role model than @entity70			0
millennial women can get involved by letting their representatives know they want legislation that addresses wage parity for men and women			1
additionally , one of the most powerful things young women can do for their own negotiations is to organize with their peers before and after taking a job , so they can know compare notes and know if they are being underpaid			2
information makes a difference in knowing what to ask for			0
the best news to come out of this study is that we strongly and rightly acknowledge that the old boy 's club is still in place			2
young women are far more likely than men their age to cite the continued existence of the wage gap and the reality -- supported by a glance at a recent study on the stagnant role of women on corporate boards -- that men have it easier when it comes to getting the top job			1
they are just as likely as older women to say that society is set still set up to serve men			2
that 's notable and promising , since many women my age have been fed the myth that the feminist movement achieved its goals and sexism no longer exists			2
but i worry that we , as young women , while understanding sexism to be a systemic problem , still think of it as something we have to fix individually -- and therefore , we do n't want to see ourselves as victims of it			0
in the @entity1 study , i was surprised to see that while women are highly aware of gender discrimination and the different forms it takes , very few reported experiencing it themselves			1
read : the generation we love to dump on it 's much less scary to imagine sexism as something that happens to other women			2
once you 're forced to admit that you 've experienced it , you have to either accept it or do something about it			0
@entity139 is hearing your pain and your struggle in another woman 's voice and suddenly realizing there 's nothing wrong with you and nothing wrong with her , but something wrong with the world trying to make you think there is			0
it 's easy to focus the conversation on specific examples of highly privileged women who 've made it to the upper echelons of power			0
but feminism is n't about making it possible for a few women to get power			0
instead , it 's about changing the system from the ground up so that all women have that opportunity			0
in order to do that , women have to be on an equal playing field in terms of pay from the moment they accept their first job			1
some may take from this new study that millennial women , despite the narrowing wage gap , have a bleak view of their future			1
as a member of that group , i 'd argue that we have a realistic view			0
it 's that understanding -- that the fight is not over and there is still much more work to be done -- that might make us the generation that crafts workplaces and a world where sexism is truly a thing of the past .			1
