-- @entity3 , the no. 2 man in @entity4 and a longtime public face of the terrorist network , is dead , @entity2 spokesman @entity1 said tuesday			1
@entity8 's death was " another serious blow to core @entity4 , " said @entity1			1
" his death is part of the degradation taking place in core @entity4 in the last several years , " @entity1 said			1
earlier tuesday , @entity15 officials said that @entity3 was killed monday by a @entity17 drone strike in @entity18			1
@entity8 's death marks one of the most significant blows to @entity4 since the @entity15 military killed @entity22 in a daring nighttime raid in @entity18 a year ago			1
@entity8 was second - in - command behind @entity4 leader @entity25 , who took the helm after @entity22 's death			1
what does this mean for @entity4 ? " there is no one who even comes close in terms of replacing the expertise ( @entity4 ) has just lost , " said a @entity15 official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity			1
@entity8 " played a critical role in the group 's planning against the @entity41 , providing oversight of the external operations efforts , " the official said			1
" @entity45 will be hard - pressed to find any one person who can readily step into @entity3 's shoes , " the official said			0
" in addition to his gravitas as a longstanding member of @entity53 's leadership , @entity3 's religious credentials gave him the authority to issue fatwas , operational approvals and guidance to the core group in @entity18 and regional affiliates			2
" monday 's strike was the third such deadly attack in as many days and the 21st suspected @entity15 drone strike in @entity18 this year			1
at least six missiles were fired at a militant compound near the town of @entity66 in the @entity67 near the @entity69 border			2
official : 15 militants killed in suspected @entity15 drone strike in @entity18 some jihadists do not believe the report and will continue to wage jihad , said the @entity76 , which monitors @entity78 extremism			1
" most jihadists discussing the issue prayed that @entity3 is still alive and urged fellow supporters to await confirmation , " the group said on its website			0
" some took the news as fact and prayed that he be accepted by @entity88 as a ' martyr			0
' one jihadist wrote : ' just as the @entity91 said more than once , our jihad is not dependent on an individual and not even on a group			0
so , if @entity4 is annihilated hero by hero and only its memory remains ( ! ! ) , jihad will remain standing by the command of @entity102			2
' " their skepticism may be well - founded			0
reports that emerged a couple of years ago that @entity3 was slain proved incorrect			0
@entity4 's leadership has been so thinned by the @entity15 drone campaign in @entity18 that these men were the only two real leaders of the organization left , @entity15 counterterrorism officials said , according to @entity0 security analyst @entity111			1
@entity4 offshoots in other parts of the world , such as the group 's affiliate in @entity117 , have meanwhile become more potent and worrisome to the @entity15			2
an @entity119 scholar and high - ranking member of the group , @entity3 frequently appeared in videos posted on the @entity123			0
he delivered speeches praising @entity4 leaders , urging resistance and trying to recruit new members			2
" @entity8 is a key motivator in the global jihadi movement and his messages convey a clear threat to @entity15 persons or property worldwide , " said a " @entity136 " statement posted on the website of the @entity131 's " @entity135 " program , which offers rewards for information about suspected terrorists			2
read more about drones on @entity0 's @entity145 blog " @entity8 is believed to be in hiding in @entity69 or @entity18 , " said the website , which offered a reward of up to $ 1 million for the 49 - year - old @entity148			1
@entity8 purportedly was among @entity4 leaders focusing on @entity148 since last year to establish a presence there			1
in a video message to fellow @entity148 distributed on jihadist forums in december , @entity3 said , " at this crossroads you have found yourselves : you either choose a secular regime that pleases the greedy crocodiles of the @entity41 and for them to use it as a means to fulfill their goals , or you take a strong position and establish the religion of @entity102			0
" @entity8 was captured in 2002 and imprisoned at @entity163 in @entity69 , according to the @entity15 government , but he escaped in 2005			2
@entity4 's most wanted in 2008 , a statement posted on radical @entity119 websites known to carry messages from @entity4 described how four " military leaders " including @entity3 escaped from the prison , but the statement said then that one of the escapees , @entity171 , had been killed in a @entity15 airstrike			1
the statement said that , among those escaping with @entity176 , was key @entity4 figure @entity177 , who died in a subsequent @entity179 airstrike			2
another escapee , @entity180 , was captured in @entity69 in 2006			0
@entity176 's death left @entity3 as the only remaining member of that escape who had not been killed or captured			0
president @entity186 's administration recently defended its use of unmanned drones to target suspected terrorists overseas in a rare public statement , with @entity191 , the president 's top counterterrorism adviser , saying the strikes are conducted " in full accordance with the law			0
" the program uses unmanned aerial vehicles , often equipped with hellfire missiles , to target suspected terrorists in remote locations overseas , with many such strikes occurring in @entity117 and @entity18 , despite internal opposition to the practice within the latter country			0
@entity191 said the @entity15 " respects national sovereignty and international law " and is guided by the laws of war in ordering those attacks			0
the @entity18 border area is widely believed to be the operating base for the @entity212 and other militant groups that have attacked international troops in neighboring @entity69			0
