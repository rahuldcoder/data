-- on wednesday , at the glittering @entity4 hotel , in front of a who 's who of the @entity8 , the front page of the world 's newest daily broadsheet was unveiled			1
the world 's newest daily newspaper editor - in - chief , @entity12 , former editor of the @entity15 's @entity14 newspaper , showed the new @entity18 paper off to an audience which included crown prince sheikh @entity21			1
" @entity26 " has been designed in the style of a @entity15 broadsheet and aims to give the capital of the @entity8 a public voice			1
it has an editorial team of 200 -- including a host of former @entity14 employees hired by @entity12 -- which is the largest working on an english - language daily in the @entity32			1
among @entity12 's new staff is @entity34 , former corporate finance editor of the @entity35 , who is business editor			1
former @entity39 correspondent , @entity37 is executive editor of the paper			0
" @entity18 is about to have a national daily newspaper , and i hope and believe that it will be a very good one , " he wrote on his blog francesalut.com in the run up to the launch			2
the paper 's breadth of coverage is indeed impressive -- the first edition included 20 pages of business , arts , news and sport			2
" it is a late stage of my career to be participating , for the first time in the thrill of launching a national newspaper			0
" if truth be told , it is also a late stage in the career of newspapers themselves for an event of this kind to be occurring			0
i can not imagine many parts of the world where anyone would think of embarking on such a project , " @entity37 continues			0
" @entity26 " is owned by an investment fund controlled by the @entity18 government -- one of the richest governments in the world -- and it is yet another expression of the ambitiousness of the federation 's plans for the future			1
in spite of the grandness of the launch , there is no obvious business case for a new daily in @entity18			2
fewer than 500,000 adults with @entity89 as their mother tongue live in @entity91 and there are already five daily newspapers catering for this section of the market			1
in fact , the most obvious gap in the market is for a popular newspaper aimed at @entity101 speakers			0
press freedom is another issue that is lurking under " @entity26 's " shiny new veneer			0
in the run up to the launch , editor @entity12 glossed over the issue of editorial freedoms in the state - owned broadsheet			1
@entity111 's presence at the launch is a sign of his backing and insiders say he wants a newspaper that reports on a federation - wide basis and is prepared to challenge official complacency wherever it exists			2
but it is impossible to say that " @entity26 " is independent			0
a paper that can fearlessly criticize government policy in the federation is still a long way in the future			0

" @entity26 " the @entity18 - based national broadsheet launched wednesday
@entity12 , former @entity14 editor is the paper 's editor - in - chief
it is owned by the @entity18 government and backed by @entity111
the @entity8 already has five daily newspapers catering to @entity89 speakers
