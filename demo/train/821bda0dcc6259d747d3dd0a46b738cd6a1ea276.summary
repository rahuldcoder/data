-- in accepting the @entity3 last year , @entity2 activist @entity1 thanked women of the @entity6 world for her medal			1
without their struggle to win equal rights , she would not be there , she said			0
the greatest challenge in that quest is not religion but the lack of economic and social development and a dearth of perceived security , said a @entity19 released monday			1
" the idea that coming in with a secular liberal social program as the solution to fixing how societies view women is n't supported by the evidence , " said @entity21 , executive director of the @entity22			1
she said the women in the @entity29 have very much the same priorities as women in @entity32			1
they want to lead prosperous lives			0
" the research shows that human development and overall education and economic empowerment are the most important interventions we can make to help women 's rights , " @entity21 said			1
@entity29 women beat men in education , lose out at work the @entity22 report urged policymakers to allow @entity6 women 's own priorities to guide efforts at gender equality			1
@entity22 conducted multiple surveys of 1,000 people each time in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity2 and @entity57			2
the data was collected between 2009 and 2011 , before the the escalation of violence in @entity55 this year			0
in @entity57 , the surveys began in february 2010 and were restricted to eastern cities and did not include @entity63			0
the survey found that both women and men rate their lives worse now than it was before the @entity68 but believe they will be better in five years			2
the exception was in @entity53 , where women and men rated their futures higher now than under @entity72			2
a majority of women in @entity6 nations said they should have equal legal rights and equal access to education and employment			1
a majority of men , though smaller , agree , @entity22 found			2
the biggest divide was in @entity56 , where 87 % of women and 59 % of men say women and men should have the same legal rights , " which is surprising because it is often hailed as the most progressive @entity6 state on gender issues , " @entity81 said			1
also surprising , perhaps , was that @entity6 women were as likely as their male counterparts to favor sharia or @entity91 law as a source of new legislation			1
in @entity53 , where the once - banned @entity94 dominated parliament before it was dissolved , women and men expressed similar support for @entity98 parties and movements			2
" the current fear of the rise of @entity91 is important and we need to address that , " @entity21 said			2
" so we attempted to look at how women feel about religion			0
there is n't a gender divide			0
" the @entity22 report said male employment and education are linked to more progressive views of women 's rights and how men view the role of religion in society had no correlation to their views on gender equality			1
among @entity6 who said religion is important , 69 % supported divorce initiated by a wife			2
among those who did not consider religion important , only 49 % supported such divorce			0
however , @entity6 women differ on religion depending on where they are , @entity22 found			1
in @entity53 , women are more likely to support an @entity98 candidate , for instance , than women in @entity56 , which for years has been a secular state			0
@entity130 , who heads a policy research center in @entity132 , believes gender equality has to come from political leadership			1
what 's next for women in the @entity29 ? " women 's rights will change from the top down			1
it will not change from grassroots up , " said @entity130 , executive director of the @entity139			0
" it 's a grassroots movement that has been calling for freedom an economic rights but it did not call for women 's rights , " she said of the revolutionary movement in @entity53			1
she agreed that economic prosperity and education are top priorities for @entity53 woman but the main challenge for women is to become an essential part of the decision - making process			2
the 30 - year - old activist and blogger marched in the @entity159 protests that ousted @entity72 , but when she ran for parliament last fall on the liberal @entity163 ticket , her male colleagues refused to let her head the ticket , which meant her chances of winning votes were lower			0
they told her a woman could not win many votes , she said			0
" men do n't envision democracy with women in it , " said @entity130			2
" they say , go back home			0
it 's not your time yet			0
" @entity22 said a third of the protesters in the @entity53 revolution were women but many , like @entity130 , feel left out of the nation 's transition to democracy			1
but @entity130 , an observant muslim , said she remains optimistic that the new president of @entity53 will enact policies that empower women			0
" that is the only way out , " she said			0
some of the transitional @entity6 governments have recognized women 's participation in fomenting change			1
the @entity22 survey said @entity56 required half of each party 's electoral list to be made up of women in last fall 's constituent assembly election			1
women hold nearly 25 % of the seats			0
the poll also raised another troubling issue for @entity6 women : safety			1
women in all the countries surveyed said they feel less safe to walk alone at night after the revolution			0
the most significant drop was in @entity56 where 78 % of women said they felt safe before the overthrow of @entity214 @entity213 and only 30 % said they were safe last fall			0
women in @entity53 have reported being sexually assaulted while protesting on the streets and there were accusations of rape and sexual violence used by @entity57 dictator @entity223 's forces during that country 's rebellion			2
" the greatest barrier to women 's participation in public life may be their perception of lack of safety and respect , " @entity81 said			1
@entity130 said she feels scared to be in crowds in @entity132			0
" sexual harassment is real problem that has been happening in @entity53 for so long , " she said			0
the @entity22 report urged national leaders to address the perceived lack of safety " to help increase women 's confidence to participate in all aspects of life , including politics			1
" in her @entity247 speech , @entity1 , had addressed many of the issues raised in @entity22 's survey			2
" the solution to women 's issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated , the energy of both women and men together , " she said			1
" our civilization is called human civilization , " she said , " and is not attributed only to men or women			0
" who are @entity29 's most influential women ?			0

a new @entity22 poll finds @entity6 women have the same priorities as women in @entity32
@entity272 and social development are *key* to gender equality
a perceived lack of safety is also a *stumbling* block for women 's participation
women are just as likely as men to favor legislation based on sharia or @entity91 law
