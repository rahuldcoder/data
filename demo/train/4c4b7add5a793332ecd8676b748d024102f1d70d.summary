-- the eurozone crisis has truly engulfed @entity2 -- but is it because the country is insolvent or simply unable to access funds easily in the financial markets ? if @entity2 is solvent , a distinction can perhaps be drawn between it and the countries surviving on bailout funds from @entity11 and the @entity12 -- @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
the solution , in this case , would be for the @entity18 to provide cheap liquidity -- loans , effectively -- to the @entity2 government for a limited period of time			1
the markets would then be pacified and the crisis would begin to be resolved			1
if only it were that easy			1
the distinction between being insolvent and unable to access funds easily in the financial markets might be natural to enterprises but it does not easily fit sovereign states			1
@entity2 is certainly finding it difficult to access funds -- the bond markets are gradually turning the tap off by pushing rates on ten year bonds above 7 %			2
but how can we tell if it is insolvent ? @entity40 means that @entity2 could be reliably expected to service its national debt out of its expanding gross domestic product ( gdp )			2
if lenders were confident about growth and sufficient tax revenues , they would continue to meet @entity2 's public borrowing needs			1
if they were not , the country would have a liquidity problem , as is currently happening			2
solvency and liquidity are closely connected for sovereign states			2
financial markets rightly worry about @entity2 's solvency			1
they have often been wrong during the last several years , but not this time			2
since the mid- 1990s , @entity2 growth has been less than 2 % a year ; investment and consumption have been practically flat ; increases in people 's real income have been among the weakest in @entity11 , worse even than @entity64			1
@entity2 households , traditionally conservative , have increased their borrowing to 45 % of gdp			2
only one word can characterize @entity2 performance during the years of monetary union : stagnation			2
the country has systematically lost competitiveness relative to @entity64			2
the result has been one of the highest national debts in @entity11 , standing at around 120 % of gdp			0
critically , as @entity2 households have come under pressure , national saving has been steadily declining , making it difficult for the country to service its national debt			0
lenders are justifiably worried since , in all these respects , @entity2 looks similar to the struggling smaller economies of the eurozone periphery			0
it might be a sizeable economy with a large industrial base , but that means little in this case			0
the @entity91 -- which is the system within which the euro operates -- has trapped several countries of diverging competitiveness within a rigid framework of fixed exchange rates , a single monetary policy , tough fiscal discipline , and continuous pressure on labor			0
the markets realize that @entity2 's debt predicament is similar to peripheral countries , and are sensing that the crisis is gradually moving to the core			1
the response of the @entity107 has been a testament to its weakness			1
to placate markets it has demanded the imposition of austerity on @entity2			0
but the economics of austerity makes no sense at all			0
@entity2 problems have originated in a stagnant economy , not in a profligate state			0
austerity would almost certainly make things worse by pushing the country into recession , thus worsening the burden of debt			0
@entity13 is an extreme case , but it shows graphically the dangers			0
@entity2 is entering a risky path -- and the markets know it			0
on top of that , the imposition of austerity has directly transgressed on @entity2 sovereignty and on the domestic democratic process , as it has done elsewhere in the periphery			0
the @entity107 appears to be increasingly run by a small cabal of core countries which impose decisions on others , ignore national institutions and practices , and even force elected governments out of office in preference to so - called non-political administrators			1
as the liquidity crisis gets sharper and @entity2 threatens to be shut out of the markets , the @entity107 has only one weapon in its armory : the @entity18			1
it must stem the unfolding collapse of the monetary union by allowing the @entity18 to buy large volumes of @entity2 debt			0
but this could only fix the shortage of liquidity -- @entity2 's solvency problem will continue and probably become worse through austerity			1
if , moreover , the @entity18 started freely to purchase the public debt of the other 16 countries , it would soil its own balance sheet , a dangerous course to adopt as there is no state to back it up			0
the credibility of the euro would suffer across the world , defeating the purpose of the monetary union for @entity64 and other countries at the core			0
with @entity2 in turmoil , the @entity91 is coming up against its own contradictions and probably heading for a breakup			1
the mix of economic malfunctioning and open disregard for national sovereignty and democracy is highly combustible			0
peripheral countries , in particular , are steadily forced toward the exit , with @entity13 under the most intense pressure			0
this is probably the only way to break out of the trap of monetary union , while restoring sovereignty and reasserting democracy			1
should that occur , the implications for the @entity11 and the global economy will be very severe			0
but those who decide @entity107 policy would have only themselves to blame			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198			1

@entity198 is the lead *author* of a new @entity202 *report* ' breaking up ? a @entity203 of the @entity204 '
he says the @entity107 's @entity207 is probably heading for a break up
@entity210 : the response of the @entity107 has been a testament to its weakness
