-- humans have been doodling in snow , in sand and on cave walls for more than 30,000 years			1
@entity10 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 were doodlers			2
@entity12 and @entity13 are among today 's active doodlers			0
yet most of us have n't reflected on why we feel compelled to draw			0
in fact , many parts of our society -- including businesses , schools and colleges -- frown on doodling and consider it a waste of time			1
while we ca n't overcome cultural biases overnight , we can certainly ask a relevant question : why is doodling so universal ? what is doodling doing for us ? @entity29 , an immunologist at the @entity30 at @entity31 , knows from personal and professional experience what doodling does			1
after struggling with organic chemistry in college , she decided to try doodling the complexities of the subject rather than memorizing them from the textbook			1
@entity29 happened upon what native doodlers have known for a long time : doodling can improve cognitive performance			1
because of her success in transforming her own learning process , @entity29 incorporated doodling and visual note - taking into her university classroom for more than two decades , and she told me it notably improved the success rate of her students			1
@entity29 is not the only one who 's learned to be impressed by the doodle			1
@entity55 , a professor at the @entity56 , published a study finding a 29 percent increase in information retention gained by doodlers			1
she noted that , contrary to popular belief , doodling seems to prevent people from losing focus on boring or complex subject matter			2
it gives learners who may otherwise mentally check out an opportunity to check back in			0
other researchers exploring the impact of doodling and drawing have come to equally significant conclusions about this deceptively simple act			1
a recent article in @entity76 argued that drawing in science education caters to individual learning preferences and motivates students to engage and explore content in a more meaningful way			2
and classroom research shows that not only do learners better understand concepts through simple drawing , but it sets the stage for innovative and divergent ways of thinking			2
for a nation with an ego wounded by our decreased scores on the @entity95 , this unfettered access to creative thinking should n't be underestimated			0
just ask @entity96 , the only company on record with an official @entity98 on the payroll			0
@entity96 's culture is well known for its 80/20 " innovation time off " rule			0
and for many employees , that time is spent using simple visual language to doodle , sketch and prototype new business opportunities			2
indeed , many companies seeking an edge are looking to applications of hand - drawn visual language as a prospective lifeboat			0
in a hyper - competitive marketplace , thinkers need all the mojo they can muster			0
to the throngs of doodlers around the world , this evidence is likely just the beginning of our gentle " i told you so " moments			0
learning that accommodates more than text - based or verbal information amplifies the effects of cognition and creativity			2
and when the science article suggested that drawing should be recognized along with reading , writing and speaking as a key element in education , it was a hallelujah moment for doodlers around the world			1
i 'm one of them			0
i use doodling for a variety of reasons : i use it to get clarity around a concept , i use it to relax , i use it to communicate ideas with others and get their refinement of them , i use it to map complex systems for companies , i use it to run innovation games for business , i use it to get insight on something puzzling me			1
see some examples of how doodles are used so how do you get better at doodling ? it 's a delightfully easy task			1
learners can start with the @entity164 , a series of six flowsâ € ” the point , line , arc , angle , spiral and loop , and the six formsâ € ” the oval , eye , triangle , rectangle , house and cloud			0
with these 12 " letters , " prospective doodlers can articulate any visual representation of any concept they can imagine			0
all it takes is a commitment to learning this language , native to our brain 's visual cortex , and applying it to challenges either at work or at school			0
rather than talking in circles about a complex subject , try doodling it using words and pictures			2
show your teachers and colleagues another way to see information			1
the insights and aha moments will arrive naturally in the process			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity209 : doodles are an *ancient* human art form
she says doodling is a way to visualize ideas and learn more *quickly*
studies show those who doodle retain more of the information they are taught
@entity209 : drawing should be recognized with reading , writing and speaking
