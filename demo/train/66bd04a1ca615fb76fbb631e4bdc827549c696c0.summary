-- everyone -- and we mean everyone -- puts their proverbial best foot forward online			2
and why should n't they ? they say that first impressions are everything , and in today 's screen - welded - to - your - face age , you may not even be present when someone first makes your acquaintance			1
a @entity16 photo , blog post , or tweet is as good as a handshake			0
but that handshake that seemed so firm and reassuring online ? yeah , it could be limp as hell in real life			1
it 's probably pretty safe to say that we 've all been intrigued by someone 's online presence at one time or another : a cute mutual friend on @entity16 , a blogger with a particularly attractive headshot , a minor celebrity with a penchant for oversharing			1
some of us may have even struck up relationships with said objects of affection , trading e-mails , texts and phone calls into the night -- forming attachments with people we 've never , essentially , met			0

" " @entity59 " ( airing on monday nights at 11 p.m. et / @entity64 ) , is based on the documentary by the same name			1

it 's not spying , it 's virtual contraception			0
" @entity56 says you may want to reconsider if : -- they have fewer than 100 friends on @entity16 , -- they are a model - slash - something else incredible ( e.g. model / doctor ) -- none of their photos are tagged -- they are talking primarily to a ton of other guys or girls who do n't seem to know them personally 3			0
dress down " you would be shocked how casual people tend to be when meeting their online crushes and you do n't wan na feel awkwardly overdressed , " @entity55 says			1
do n't do it at your home " the last thing you want is some stranger knowing where you live , " he says			2
have an activity planned " sitting across from somebody for coffee or dinner can get real awkward real fast			0
better to make it a social event and go bowling or something , " @entity55 suggests			0
bring a friend and an open mind " you never how things will go down , " @entity56 notes .			2
