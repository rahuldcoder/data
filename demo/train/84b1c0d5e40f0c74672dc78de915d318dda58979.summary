-- the goal of " @entity3 , " creative director @entity1 said , was to have " moved the ball down the field " in terms of how video games can be vehicles for telling engrossing , expansive stories			1
but the latest entry into the wildly popular franchise does more than just move the ball down the field			1
it kicks it squarely through the goalposts with a mind - blowing story set in an alternate reality that may be only a short trip from our real - world track			1
" @entity3 " takes place in a version of @entity24 in the floating city of @entity26 , a technological marvel on which a prophet has chosen to lead his people away from the " @entity31 below			1
" @entity32 , a former military man and @entity34 agent , is charged with going to the city in the sky and rescuing a young girl , @entity37 , who has the power to manipulate time and space			1
indeed , the game plays with the concept of time from its very beginning			1
an @entity46 barbershop quartet sings " @entity47 only knows " by the @entity48			2
a mechanical horse is advertised as " @entity50			2
" the city itself feels like a floating @entity53 , with new inventions , a carnival - like atmosphere and everyone speaking about how much better things will be tomorrow -- all based on the prophet 's guidance			1
the environments are colorful and vibrant , reflective of the game 's disparate moods of optimism and turmoil			1
the city feels like it has gravitas while remaining lofty in the clouds			2
there is even a beach and " ocean , " so i guess we get to see where rain really comes from			2
steampunkish " voxophones " and " kinetoscopes " scattered throughout the city help provide aural and visual backstories for current events			2
they fill in the history blanks and give the player a better understanding of actions that take place			2
of course , @entity37 is key to the @entity87 's plan to bring judgment on the sinners below , so @entity32 's time in @entity26 is not going to be an easy one			1
combat in " @entity93 " is based very much on the principles from other " @entity97 " games , with some slight tweaks			2
instead of plasmids ( the power source in the first two games ) , so - called vigors are the source of @entity32 's environmental powers			1
from throwing fireballs to directing flocks of ravens or firing lightning bolts , the vigors are permanent once acquired and powered by salts found throughout the city			0
think of salts as ammunition for your vigor weapons			0
' @entity97 ' creator talks history , writing and ' nerdity ' there are more traditional weapons as well			0
pistols , shotguns , machine guns -- they 're all here			0
both the guns and the vigors are upgradable through purchased additions at vending machines , so keep an eye out for coins wherever you find them			0
the nice addition for combat is making vigors and weapons dual - wieldable			1
you can mow down an opponent with bullets or rockets while tossing them in the air with a @entity140 vigor			0
in previous games , this was an either / or venture , so it is nice to be able to mix and match your attacks to whatever you choose			0
however , the heart of the game is @entity37			1
she is your constant companion throughout the game , offering help in combat or pointing out items you might miss as you travel throughout @entity26			1
her ability to create windows into other worlds can help bring in supplies or allies during battle as well			0
she is also a master thief who can pick locks quickly			0
@entity37 is never in danger during combat and never takes damage			1
in that way , she is not one big escort mission but a true companion during your adventures			1
getting @entity37 just right was a massive undertaking for @entity165 and @entity1 , who said the game 's release date was pushed back a year solely to perfect her			1
their success lies in the empathy the player develops toward her as the game progresses			2
you feel and see her frustrations , her joys and her pain			0
her tiny movements , such as bending over to closely examine a new item for the first time ( even one that has no bearing on the game ) , give her a human feeling without treading into @entity184 ( where animation comes so close to actual human behavior that it causes discomfort )			2
without going into spoiler territory , there were two separate instances where i really thought the development teams nailed it			0
the first was during a tense situation early in the game where @entity37 is trying to understand what 's going on and why people were fighting over her			1
@entity32 tries to explain that different sides want different things from her			0
her response : " well , i want a puppy , but that does n't mean i 'm going to get one			0
" it felt like the way a teenager would react to a stressful situation			0
the second came during a scene in which @entity32 is talking with people who suddenly disappear			0
as a gamer , i shrugged it off and accepted it			0
however , when i turned around , i caught sight of @entity37 , who was standing there with the best " wth ? " look i 've ever seen in a video game			1
little moments like that combine to reveal a character who is n't just a companion but who helps move the story along in a meaningful way			1
at first , you want to help yourself			0
later , you want to help @entity37			1
by the end , you want both			0
and your emotions will be real			0
in this way , @entity1 and his team have succeeded in creating not only an excitingly wonderful game but one that will make the player think for days after the game is done			2
" @entity3 " earns its title by the end of the game			1
the possibilities , like time and space , are endless			0
the overarching narrative portrays struggles on so many different levels , but it is your story of struggle that is ultimately important and the one you guide to its conclusion			2
" @entity3 " is available worldwide on tuesday for the @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252			1
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore , intense violence , language , mild sexual themes and use of alcohol and tobacco			0
this review was completed using a provided retail copy for the @entity251 .			0
