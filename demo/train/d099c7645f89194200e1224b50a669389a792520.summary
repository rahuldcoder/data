-- a new report said that " @entity6 " was a favorite video game of @entity5 shooter @entity3			1
he had no history of violent behavior			2
but he was interested in mass murderers			0
nearly a year since the tragic shooting at @entity5 where @entity3 killed 26 people , @entity12 's state attorney office released its official report that tried to piece together what happened			1
the investigation provided some insights into the life and actions of the gunman , but his motive remains a mystery			1
the report suggests that improving the delivery of mental health care to those with chronic mental illness may be an important element in reducing certain acts of violence , and that mass shooters are not " enthralled " with violent video games			1
@entity3 was a young man with clear mental health issues			1
he appears to have been isolated , even communicating with his mother mainly through e-mail despite their living in the same house			0
it seems he had some obsessive - compulsive qualities related to food preferences , dislike of loud noises or being touched , and a disdain for holidays and birthdays			0
@entity3 's issues with social communication and problems with crowds worsened in later years			1
he was also diagnosed with @entity52 's syndrome			0
the report notes he declined to take any medications or participate in behavioral therapy			0
however , it makes no mention of him being aggressive or violent before the shooting			1
the report does suggest he had an interest in things related to death and mass shootings			0
@entity3 had a spreadsheet of mass murderers			2
he also had literature related to pedophilia -- but no child pornography			0
from all of this information it 's hard to draw any conclusion			0
but it 's fair to say that chronic mental health issues are common among mass shooters , including @entity3			1
on the other hand , it 's important to note that most individuals with chronic mental illness are not violent			2
nor is @entity52 linked to violence			0
the tragedy at @entity5 may represent a missed opportunity to have a frank discussion about our inadequate mental health system			2
other than a few nods to the issue we did n't have that discussion			0
mainly , we talked about gun control and video games			2
while it 's certainly true that most mentally ill people are nonviolent , research also suggests that chronic mental health issues such as psychosis or depression are risk factors for violence , particularly when mixed with chronic anger			1
we must do more to take away the stigma associated with mental illness			0
yet pretending no relationship exists between mental health issues and some acts of violence may backfire by reducing our sense of urgency in improving the mental health care system			0
as for the issue of video games , the @entity5 shooting set off a year 's worth of speculation about the harm violent video games may or may not do and whether they are a threat to society			1
the report , in the end , had relatively little to say about video games and did not link them to the shooting			1
for example , much like any 20 - year - old , @entity3 played an assortment of both violent and nonviolent games			1
but it turns out that he was fond of games that were nonviolent , particularly " @entity6 " and " @entity126			0
" despite speculation and efforts by some politicians such as sen. @entity131 and rep. @entity132 to tie mass shootings to violent video games , @entity3 's video game playing was unremarkable			1
once again we are reminded of our society 's eagerness to assign blame quickly even if evidence suggests otherwise			0
for example , the youth violence rate has actually declined by nearly 90 % during the video game era			1
that statistic is one reason why policymakers should not rush forward with regulations before we get the full picture			0
in the end , we may simply never know why @entity3 did what he did other than that he was a disturbed , angry young man who made the choice to do something horrible			2
perhaps it is time to stop looking for external explanations for his behavior and acknowledge that this catastrophic choice was his and his alone			0
as we approach the one - year anniversary of the shooting , our thoughts and prayers will be going out to the families of the victims of @entity5			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity12 has released official report on the tragic shooting at @entity5
@entity169 : the motive of gunman @entity3 remains a mystery
he says we need to improve the delivery of care to the *chronically* mentally ill
@entity164 : @entity3 's video game playing was unremarkable , not tied to violent games
