even though @entity1 had beaten his first - round opponent at the @entity3 , @entity4 , five straight times , the @entity6 was n't sure what to expect when they played monday			1
after all @entity1 last competed at a major at @entity10 and had lost both singles matches that he contested this year as he returned from appendix surgery			1
@entity1 -- who also suffered from back and wrist injuries in 2014 -- cast doubt on his @entity3 participation just last week			1
@entity4 , too , owned four victories over the 14 - time grand slam champion			1
but in a score that is sure to have his rivals taking note , the @entity6 crushed the former top - 10 regular 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 2			0
" very positive result for me , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" i think very good start			0
" always before the first match you have the doubts , especially in this situation i 'm arriving here			2
never easy , but it was an important match for me			2
was a comfortable victory that give me some confidence			0
" @entity1 habitually lingers on court even when he wins in straight sets but he needed just one hour , 50 minutes to dispose of the veteran @entity34			1
he only faced one break point , dropped four points behind his first serve and struck 22 more winners than unforced errors			0
" i think i returned well , " said the 2014 finalist			0
" my return worked really well			0
i served , i think , the right way , with only one break point during the whole match			0
and in general i played with not many mistakes			0
" @entity1 could face @entity44 in the semifinals , and the @entity46 began his charge with a 6 - 4 6 - 2 7 - 5 win over @entity48			1
@entity48 has upset the likes of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 in the past but he only really challenged the 17 - time grand slam winner in the third set			1
an attacking @entity44 -- appearing in a record extending 61st straight major -- approached the net more than 40 times , winning 70 % of those points			2
@entity1 and @entity44 were joined in the second round by two - time grand slam winner @entity51 , although an outside contender for the women 's draw , @entity65 , fell			1
there was a time when many thought the former no. 1 would never return to the top 10 and top five but 2013 and 2014 saw the @entity71 re-climb the rankings			0
and last week , she extended @entity74 to three sets in a final in @entity77			0
her goal in 2015 , she said , was to perform her best at the grand slams , yet monday 's 1 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 loss to @entity81 qualifier @entity83 means she still has n't figured things out			2
@entity65 heavily contributed to her downfall , hitting 10 double faults			2
it 's now only one grand slam quarterfinal for @entity65 in her past nine attempts			1
" it 's really disappointing , " @entity65 told reporters			1
" it 's probably the worst thing that could happen			0
" i really have to now sit and work on few things and just maybe try to have a different approach to this kind of event and try to see what was lacking			0
" @entity65 admitted to nerves prior to the encounter , as did third - seed @entity101 ahead of her match against @entity103			1
but the fast - rising @entity101 overcame the nerves and eased past the @entity105 6 - 3 6 - 2			2
@entity74 , bidding for a first major outside the @entity107 in seven years , defeated @entity108 6 - 4 6 - 1			0
@entity101 's reward is a second - round clash with @entity112 @entity111 , who snapped a long drought at her home major			1
having lost all nine of her previous matches in @entity117 , the big - serving @entity111 ousted @entity101 's fellow @entity119 @entity118 6 - 3 6 - 4			1
" i was talking to my coach and i told him i actually did feel like i won the @entity3 , " @entity111 said			2
" it was just the first round but it 's been such a long time coming			2
not to be able to do it in your home @entity123 was very devastating for me			0
" later , there was more joy for @entity112 as two of its brightest prospects won five setters			0
first @entity132 upset 11th seed @entity134 5 - 7 6 - 0 1 - 6 7 - 6 ( 2 ) 8 - 6			0
@entity135 -- who saved four match points in the fourth -- celebrated by doing a victory lap. not long after and past midnight in @entity117 , @entity139 -- @entity1 's conqueror at @entity10 -- edged @entity141 7 - 6 ( 2 ) 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 7 ( 5 ) 6 - 3 .			1

@entity1 crushes @entity4 at the @entity3
it was @entity1 's first grand slam match since last year at @entity10
but women 's contender @entity65 loses her opener in @entity117
@entity44 , @entity101 , @entity51 *progress* to the second round
