@entity0 , @entity1 -- a desperate @entity1 farmer fighting to hold onto his land -- a year after the country 's political rivals pledged to govern jointly -- fears he will eventually lose to politics and violence			1
@entity10 's farm was gutted by fire , as was his father - in - law 's			1
the power - sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in @entity1			1
@entity19 is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite president @entity23 's policy of redistributing white - owned farms to landless blacks			1
" why do they want to remove me when i 've complied with everything they want ? what more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that 's the case , then admit that that is the policy			2
pass a law : no whites are allowed to farm			0
then it makes it clear , " @entity19 said			0
since 2000 , @entity23 's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land , destroying @entity1 's once prosperous agricultural sector			1
" when the land reform program began , we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude ; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out			2
so i voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father - in - law 's farm , " @entity19 said			2
a year later the government came knocking on his door again , he said , demanding more land			2
@entity19 told @entity2 he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father - in - law 's farm , which he then owned			1
now an army general is demanding @entity19 's remaining 30 percent			0
when @entity1 's new unity government was formed -- with @entity23 's @entity61 and @entity63 's @entity62 -- in february this year , the general allegedly posted soldiers on @entity19 's farm			1
the farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point			2
when @entity2 visited @entity19 's farm this month , workers were standing idle			1
maize and tobacco , which @entity19 said is worth more than @entity74 $ 1 million , lay in storage			0
" they 've switched off our irrigation system , taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize , " he told @entity2			1
so @entity19 had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room			0
he took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted			0
with the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but @entity19 said : " nothing is happening here			2
there is no land audit happening , no one comes out here to check , to see			2
we are just left vulnerable			0
" on another farm , @entity10 's fight for his land has just escalated to another level			2
@entity10 has been repeatedly beaten , arrested and harassed			0
now his farmhouse and that of his father - in - law have been gutted by a mysterious fire			1
see the destruction the fire caused @entity10 could not say for sure that this is arson but told @entity2 that the group of @entity61 youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house			1
" one time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming			0
they were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you do n't get out , " he said			0
@entity10 and his father - in - law @entity123 are among a group of @entity1 farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern @entity131 tribunal			1
but @entity23 has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal			0
farmers can not contest land issues in @entity1 and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either			1
when @entity2 interviewed @entity23 's minister of state , @entity136 , about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms , he blamed the farmers for the violence , saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land			1
" human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites , and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us , it did n't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights			2
" and sometimes we say , good heavens , if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about , you better keep them away from us ; we do n't want to see them , " he told @entity2			1
but it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire			2
they continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated			0
some have even been killed			0
tractor driver @entity166 said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted			1
" they actually say you the workers , you are ones that are supporting the white farmer			1
that is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go , " @entity166 told @entity2			1
many farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before			0
@entity19 said : " when @entity61 was in power , you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us			0
but now that these positions are being shared with mr. @entity63 's @entity62 , mr. @entity23 has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program			1
and when it comes to the @entity62 , the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch			0
i have asked mr. @entity63 to intervene but nothing is happening			0
" prime minister @entity63 refuted that			0
" that is not true , " he said			0
" we initiated to find out who is being affected , the few remaining white farmers			1
let 's be frank here , we are talking of farmers as being white , but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture			2
there should be no disruption of any farm activity			0
" to those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win .			0
