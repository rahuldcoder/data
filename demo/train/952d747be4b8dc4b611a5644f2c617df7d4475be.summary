-- @entity2 officials have for years secretly endorsed the @entity4 drone program , even picking out at least one target for such an attack , according to a @entity8 report			1
neither the @entity9 , the @entity10 nor the @entity2 @entity11 would comment on the story , which said top secret @entity14 documents and @entity2 memos obtained by the @entity8 described at least 65 such strikes between late 2007 and late 2011			1
the story comes as prime minister of pakistan @entity17 visited president @entity19 in @entity20			0
@entity17 told reporters he brought up the issue of drone strikes with @entity19 , " emphasizing the need for an end to such strikes			1
" @entity9 press secretary @entity27 was asked thursday about the report			2
" i ca n't speak to specific operational issues , " he said			0
" what i can tell you is that on matters of bilateral cooperation and counterterrorism , we have regular conversations with @entity2			2
" for years @entity2 officials have denounced any drone attacks , but the @entity8 story says not only did they know about the strikes but they also actively participated in selecting some targets			1
one document from 2010 contains an entry about striking a site " at the request of your government , " the @entity8 said			2
@entity0 chief national security correspondent @entity47 said his sources have told him there has long been good cooperation between intelligence agencies in the two nations			2
the @entity8 report echoes what former @entity2 president @entity54 said in april			1
but he said @entity2 's government signed off on strikes " only on a few occasions , when a target was absolutely isolated and no chance of collateral damage			1
" still , it was the first time a top past or present @entity2 official had admitted publicly to such a deal			0
unmanned @entity4 drones began launching attacks in @entity2 in 2004 , by which time @entity54 had led the country for five years after taking power in a bloodless coup			0
he said @entity2 leaders would ok @entity4 drone strikes after discussions involving military and intelligence units and only if " there was no time for our own ... military to act			1
" @entity54 left office in 2008			0
in a statement thursday , @entity54 's office stressed that " during nine years of his rule , there were less than 10 drone strikes , all of which targeted militants , and a few of them were joint operations between [ the ] @entity4 and @entity2 in locations that were not accessible to the ground forces of @entity2			1
" the statement also noted that the former military ruler said in 2009 that " these drone strikes had become indiscriminate and were losing their impact due to claims of collateral damage to the civilian population			1
" it said that @entity54 " consistently demanded [ that the ] @entity4 transfer drone technology to the @entity2 military , so @entity2 could take ownership in effectively targeting terrorists and also remedy the violation of @entity2 's sovereignty by [ the ] @entity4			2
" the @entity8 report said the @entity2 government routinely received classified briefings , including before and after photographs , on the strikes			1
@entity112 , a spokesman for the @entity2 @entity11 , said thursday that @entity115 does n't " comment on specific media reports citing unnamed sources			0
" @entity112 reiterated @entity2 's public position on strikes in a written statement			2
" whatever understandings there may or may not have been in the past , the present government has been very clear regarding its policy on the issue			0
we regard such strikes as violations of our sovereignty as well as international law , " it said			0
the number of drone attacks has been decreasing sharply in the past three years because of tighter rules imposed by the @entity19 administration and the success of the program in killing its targets			0
in august , @entity4 secretary of state @entity137 on a visit to @entity115 told a @entity2 television station that the @entity4 hoped to end drone strikes there " very , very soon			1
" president @entity19 has a " very real timeline " for ending the strikes , he said			0
