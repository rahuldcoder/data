-- sometime in late 2007 , @entity1 , a cabdriver living in @entity3 , began to have a series of phone conversations with @entity6 , one of the leaders of @entity8 , a notorious @entity9 terrorist group			0
@entity1 had no idea the @entity11 was listening in			2
in one of those phone calls @entity6 urged @entity1 to send money to @entity8 , telling him that he urgently needed several thousand dollars			1
at one point @entity6 told @entity1 that it was " time to finance the jihad " and at another , " you are running late with the stuff			0
send some and something will happen			0
" over several months in 2008 , @entity1 transferred thousands of dollars to @entity8			0
@entity1 even told @entity6 that he could use his house in the @entity9 capital , @entity28 , and " after you bury your stuff deep in the ground , you would , then , plant the trees on top			0
" @entity32 prosecutors later asserted that @entity1 was offering his house to @entity8 as a place to hide weapons			2
earlier this year the @entity3 cabbie was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to @entity8 and of money laundering for the terrorist organization			0
in 2012 , @entity8 ( " the youth " in @entity42 ) formally announced its merger with @entity44			0
however , there is nothing on the public record to suggest @entity1 was planning an attack in the @entity32			2
another financial supporter of a terrorist group who was detected by @entity11 surveillance was @entity53 , a native of @entity54 and a naturalized @entity32 living in @entity56 , @entity57			1
sometime in 2008 , @entity53 , who ran @entity58 in @entity56 , swore an oath of allegiance to @entity44 and , until he was arrested two years later , he sent funds to the terrorist group , providing a total of some $ 23,000 to @entity44			0
as revealed tuesday at a @entity64 hearing about the @entity11 's surveillance programs , @entity53 also had some kind of a " nascent " plan to attack the @entity68 , according to @entity70 deputy director @entity69			1
@entity53 's attorney told @entity72 he had no part in such a plot , and court documents in his case do not mention any plan to attack the stock exchange			0
@entity8 's connection to @entity3 and @entity44 's connection to @entity56 were two of the terrorist conspiracies that were uncovered by @entity11 surveillance that @entity83 and other top national security officials , including the @entity11 's director , gen. @entity85 , pointed to at tuesday 's hearing as examples of how @entity11 programs have worked to interrupt terrorist plotting			1
these officials otherwise gave no new public information to substantiate the claim that @entity85 had made last week that " dozens of terrorist events " had been averted by @entity11 surveillance , both in the @entity32 and abroad			1
on tuesday , @entity85 said he would provide members of the @entity64 additional information about some 50 other terrorists plots that had been averted in the @entity32 and around the world , but this would be behind closed doors as the details of these plots remain classified			1
the public record indicates that few of these are likely to have taken place in the @entity32			0
that 's because traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks , according to a survey of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the @entity32 since 9/11 by the @entity112			1
@entity114 extremists based in the @entity32 have mounted 43 plots to conduct attacks within the @entity32 since 2001			1
of those plots , nine involved an actual terrorist act that was not prevented by any type of government action , such as the 2009 shooting spree by maj. @entity122 at @entity123 , @entity124 , that killed 13			0
of the remaining 34 plots , the public record shows that at least 30 were uncovered by using standard policing practices such as informants , undercover officers and tips to law enforcement			0
at tuesday 's hearing , @entity83 also pointed to two other plots averted by @entity11 's programs ; the 2009 plots by @entity137 to bomb the @entity139 subway and by @entity140 to attack a @entity142 newspaper that had printed cartoons of the @entity144			2
@entity85 had previously cited the @entity137 and @entity140 cases as examples of how the @entity11 surveillance programs have averted terrorist attacks			1
tuesday 's hearing did little to reassure the public that the @entity11 's surveillance programs have done much to stop terrorist attacks at home , with the major exception of the plot by @entity137 to attack the @entity139 subway system around the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			1
as the @entity70 's @entity83 explained at tuesday 's hearing this was " the first core @entity44 plot since 9/11 " that was directed from @entity161 inside the @entity32			2
there is no doubt that it was a serious plot , but if it was the only such serious plot on @entity32 soil that the government averted as a result of the @entity11 's surveillance programs , the public will have to decide whether it justifies the large - scale government surveillance programs -- no matter how carefully they are run so as to respect @entity32 ' civil liberties .			1

@entity11 chief offered information on yield from *monitoring* phone calls
@entity176 says in two cases , @entity11 heard of plans to support terror groups overseas
@entity181 : hearing offered little to show @entity11 has done much to stop terror attacks in @entity32
@entity32 will have to decide whether giving up *privacy* *rights* is worth it , he says
