-- ten years ago , @entity1 was hiding under her bed to avoid going to rugby training with her father and her @entity6 brother			1
today , she is the world 's best women 's sevens player -- an astonishing achievement given that she took up the sport as recently as late 2012			1
now the former netball player has @entity13 gold in her sights			1
" @entity16 is why i made the move , " the @entity15 tells @entity0			0
" i 'd made our provincial team for netball but i was only on the bench that year and the following year i was cut			1
" then the sevens opportunity came up			2
it was n't quite a joke but it was a bit of fun			0
i was approaching my mid- 20s and was n't getting any younger , in a rut and this opportunity came up -- one door shutting and another one opening			0
" it was her dad , @entity32 , a former rugby league professional who played in @entity36 and @entity37 , that spotted @entity6 's @entity39 campaign to lure women players to the sevens ranks with the @entity42 in mind , and gave his daughter the nudge to follow in the family 's rugby roots			1
" so i went along with another netball player to try out			1
we turned up and were put through an @entity51 assault course			0
it was horrific , " the 25 - year - old recalls			1
" we were up at 5 a.m. and doing an obstacle course in -5 degrees in water			0
i remember at the time we were saying , ' what were we thinking , have we made the right decision ? ' " the decision paid off in some style			0
last season , @entity6 were crowned @entity61 champions and @entity1 was named player of the year at the end - of - season awards			1
this year , the @entity64 are top of the standings going into next month 's deciding tournament in @entity67 , after beating @entity37 in april 's @entity69 final			1
@entity1 is @entity6 's leading try scorer this season with 20 -- one more than the netballer she tried out with , @entity71 , who touched down a record 12 times in @entity74 , including the clincher in the final			1
that @entity1 has got to such heights so soon brought a wry smile to the face of her father and brother @entity80 , who now plies his trade with @entity83 in @entity84 after a six - year @entity6 career in which he earned 30 test caps			1
" i was terrible when i was younger , " she admits			0
" @entity80 was a bit older than me so he and @entity88 were always out training			0
" @entity88 would try to get me to train with them but i did n't want to			0
i wanted to hang out with my friends and that would have taken me away from my friends			0
" so i tried to get out of it however i could , like hiding under my bed so they would n't find me			0
" i 'm gutted now as i would n't have had to work so hard on getting fit as a 25 - year - old			1
i think they both laugh at me now			0
" quite how she never made the move before , she admits , is a bit of a mystery considering her genetics			0
but then the opportunities for female rugby players had generally been limited			2
@entity80 started playing for the @entity6 while @entity1 was at high school , and she was aware of both the prestige and pressure of pulling on such a famous jersey			1
" i used to watch him and i 've learned so much from him , " she says			0
" when i used to watch i never really followed the rules properly though			0
i understood the basics but i 've really struggled with somethings like the rucks			0
" i watch the game in a completely different way now			2
if i can emulate just a little of what he 's achieved i 'll be happy with that			2
" @entity1 's boyfriend @entity119 is also a promising star , having already represented the @entity6 sevens team and this year earning a place in the @entity124 ' @entity123 squad			1
the sport has turned her life on its head			0
until recently she worked for the @entity128 in an administrative post she had held for five years			0
her rugby commitments -- training every day from 9 to 12 plus travel to tournaments -- meant that increasingly that came too hard to continue with despite her understanding and adaptable bosses			1
so instead she has switched back to being a student -- studying part - time in childcare , in stark contrast to the rough and tumble of her fledgling rugby career			1
she describes herself and women 's sevens as being on a " steep learning curve " globally			1
at home , recognition is growing steadily for the sport			0
" but abroad it 's different , " she says			2
" the @entity6 jersey carries so much weight wherever you go and it 's then you realize how important and how prestigious it is			2
" it 's great to be a part of that			2
those guys are kings and obviously we 're a little bit down from that but it 's growing all the time			2
there 's more rugby in high schools now and we 've got schoolgirls coming into our squad now			1
" were sevens not in the @entity13 , @entity1 admits this would not be a path she would be pursuing , and that she might still be plying her sporting trade in netball			1
" i might go back to it one day , i do n't know really but i do n't miss it , i have n't had the chance , " she says			2
" also , there 's so much freedom and room to move in sevens			1
i 'm not sure i could go back to the confines of netball where you 're so constrained by your movement on the court			2
" the @entity13 is why you get up every morning and train			1
i remember watching it as a kid and loving the athletics and gymnastics in particular			0
to be able to be a part of that would be pretty special -- to aspire to gold would be amazing			0
" but it 's so competitive right now and will be even more so come 2016			2
between now and then , it 's all about building with the girls			0

@entity1 is a new *convert* to sevens despite family 's rugby *heritage*
she first showed sporting prowess in netball but quit to target 2016 @entity13
she was crowned 2013 world player of the year , marking a meteoric rise
the 25 - year - old has quit her day *job* to focus on *mastering* the game
