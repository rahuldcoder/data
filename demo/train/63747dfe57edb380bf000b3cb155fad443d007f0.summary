@entity0 , @entity1 -- despite a majestic lake stretching through its eastern border that gives way to beautiful beaches , @entity1 is the @entity7 country less - traveled			1
but it 's the place to be if you want to enjoy a natural paradise without everybody else			2
though it has n't become a booming destination like @entity13 , @entity14 or @entity15 , @entity1 has numerous attractions			1
named one of the top 10 places to go in 2014 by @entity18 , @entity1 is one of the lesser known destinations on the travel guide 's annual list , which includes @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25			1
the country is touted for its wildlife and beaches			1
but there 's more to @entity1 than animal parks , warm sands and @entity33 's adoptions			1
the locals are friendly called the " @entity37 , " in the native language , @entity1 locals exude friendliness			1
it 's common for strangers to wave and greet visitors as if they know them			2
and it 's easy to make them smile with a " moni " ( pronounced mo - nee , not money ) , which means hello in @entity47 , the local language , and " @entity49 " ( thank you )			2
curious kids often come by to say hi and see what you 're up to			0
the refrain i heard repeatedly was , " welcome			0
" although overt friendliness often arouses suspicion in the world traveler , especially when someone 's trying to sell you tchotckes , there 's hardly any hawking or selling of tacky souvenirs in @entity1 -- the people are genuinely friendly			1
founded in 1964 , @entity1 has never experienced a civil war			1
it 's not crowded you can enjoy the pristine views of massive @entity1 -- known locally as @entity1 , it 's the ninth largest lake in the world -- without having your perfect day wrecked by a bunch of vacationers blasting horrible music			1
instead , you 'll hear restaurants jamming 1990s pop music such as the @entity77 -- ca n't win them all			0
another perk : you wo n't have to jostle for reservations at hotels , restaurants or game parks			1
most of the travelers you 'll likely encounter in @entity1 are tobacco businessmen or @entity87 workers -- nary a tourist in sight			2
even the capital of @entity0 has the relaxed vibe of a garden			2
there are few cars and you can walk to places without feeling overwhelmed or fearful of getting run over			2
( the country 's commercial capital of @entity99 is much busier			2
) you can go from the high life of the @entity102 , where @entity33 stays , or sleep in more budget accommodations			0
@entity1 is spectacular although @entity1 is landlocked , its giant , freshwater lake is its life blood			2
the sunny beaches of @entity1 are golden and the waters are nearly empty except for a few boats			1
it 's home to the largest number of fish species of any lake in the world , thought to be between 500 and 1,000 , according to @entity116			0
it 's perfect for freshwater snorkeling and diving in clear water			0
the lake draws in a variety of bird species , as well as hippos , warthogs , baboons and occasional elephants			0
not bad company to enjoy the water with ( maybe not the hippos )			0
rehabilitated game parks and natural reserves tour companies offer safaris in parks and reserves that include eco-friendly trips , mountain biking , horseback riding and traditional housing stays			1
one of the best known parks is @entity139 , which became a target for poaching that continued into the 1990s			0
by the 2000s , thanks to a partnership between the government and a non-profit organization , the park was repopulated and rehabilitated			0
the @entity148 ( elephant , rhino , lion , leopard , buffalo ) can be viewed here			0
" @entity1 is not a wildlife destination , it 's not @entity158 , but that 's changing , " says @entity154 of @entity155 , a travel group operating in @entity1			1
