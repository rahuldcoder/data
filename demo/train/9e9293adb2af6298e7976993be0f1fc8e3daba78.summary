-- as the winter sports season reaches its peak in @entity6 and @entity7 so the toll of deaths and injuries will surely mount			1
every year in the @entity10 alone , an average of just over 40 people lose their lives on the slopes as a result of accidents in skiing and snowboarding , according to statistics compiled by the @entity18			1
they are sobering figures and often trotted out when a high profile celebrity such as actress @entity22 , the victim of a tragic accident in @entity24 in 2009 , is involved			2
this was drawn into sharp focus again when @entity27 , the 76 - year - old founder of the @entity28 , died thursday in a @entity30 hospital following an accident on @entity32			0
even elite level athletes are not immune to the dangers and in the past year @entity37 ski cross racer @entity35 and fellow @entity24 world championship winning freestyle skier @entity39 , have lost their lives			1
@entity41 of @entity42 was the last leading alpine racer to be killed in 2001 and while there have been no deaths since then in alpine skiing @entity37 or @entity49 competition , there have been numerous sickening crashes			1
calculated risk @entity53 's @entity52 lost control in a men 's @entity37 downhill at @entity56 in @entity57 in 2008 and had to have his left leg amputated below the knee			1
to an extent , that must be a calculated risk for the professionals because competitors in the @entity49 or @entity37 push themselves to the limit at incredible speed or attempting dangerous flips and turns			1
however , nearly every amateur skier will have a tale of someone whose alpine adventure has unfortunately ended up with a stay in the resort medical facility , flying back home with a leg in plaster with months of rehabilitation in prospect			0
over @entity32 , @entity81 golfer @entity80 fell victim to a skiing accident , breaking his leg in the @entity87 's @entity86 mountains and wrecking the early part of his 2013 season			2
but are winter sports really any more dangerous than other activities and what measures can be taken to cut down on the risks ?			1
@entity94 , is a @entity95 doctor who specializes in skiing safety and related issues and runs a dedicated website which gives advice and updates on the latest developments			1
he is also the president of the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) and a director of the @entity104			0
bad press @entity94 is adamant that skiing gets a bad press when it comes to perceptions about safety and quotes international statistics , collated by the @entity102 , to back up his claim			1
" for snow sports , the average injury rate is 2 - 3 per 1000 participants on any one day			2
compare that to an average game of soccer or rugby where perhaps the same number , or more are injured out of a much smaller number of players , " he told @entity0			0
the most typical winter sports accidents would involve knee sprains , head injuries and shoulder , wrist and lower leg injuries , according to figures on his website			1
" with regard to fatalities , in the @entity10 during the past 10 years , about 41.5 people have died skiing / snowboarding per year on average			2
during the 2010/11 season , 47 fatalities occurred out of the 60.5 million skier / snowboarder days reported for the season			0
" the rate of fatality converts to 0.78 per million skier / snowboarder visits			0
although it 's not directly comparable , in the @entity10 in 2009 , 2,400 people drowned while swimming in public areas and 800 died while bicycle riding , " @entity94 added			0
world governing body @entity150 ( @entity150 ) is only too aware of the potential dangers for leisure skiers and has produced its top 10 tips for safety on the slopes			1
@entity150 has recommended the use of helmets on the slopes since 2006 , but their use remains voluntary , despite the type of accident which befell @entity22			1
however , some travel insurance companies now insist they are worn otherwise claims by injured skiers could be invalidated			0
helmet use " i always recommend skiers and snowboarders to wear an appropriate helmet , " said @entity94			0
" although i do n't believe the overall risk is high enough to mandate their use			0
snowboarders , especially beginners , should also think carefully about using wrist guards to reduce the chances of a wrist injury			0
" we know that on average snowboarding has an injury rate about twice that of alpine skiing -- mainly due to those wrist injuries amongst beginner snowboarders falling onto outstretched hands , " he added			2
at the elite end , where speeds and the degree of daring are breathtaking , helmets are compulsory , but they can not always prevent the tragedies which befell @entity35 and @entity189			2
the @entity190 in may 2012 promised urgent action to investigate the area of competitor safety , particularly in @entity194 where four competitors start at the same time and battle it out over a course involving jumps and steep turns			1
council member @entity200 was appointed to chair a newly - appointed @entity202 , which was composed of experts with a wide range of experience across the ski disciplines			0
he had an added remit to " leverage cross discipline expertise in safety matters , notably with @entity210 and @entity194 in mind , " read a report on the official @entity150 website			1
" safety is our utmost focus but ours is a sport in which some risk always remains , " @entity150 spokesperson @entity214 told @entity0			1
good advice improvements to equipment have led to reductions in injury rates , for instance the introduction of quick release mechanisms dramatically cut the number of lower leg fractures , while smarter ski design is helping the downward injury trend in the alpine disciplines , according to @entity102 statistics			2
but with improved protection from equipment such as ski body armor , is there a danger of being lulled into a false sense of security and to attempt something above your ability level ? " my bottom line is -- if you would n't do the trick without the kit , think very carefully about attempting it with the kit , " said @entity94			0
it would appear to be good advice and he elaborates for the benefit of beginners taking to the piste for the first time			0
" take your time to gain experience on the slopes			0
get professional instruction but do n't be tempted to try too much too soon , especially if encouraged by more experienced friends			0
" read and follow the @entity150 rules			1
use the best equipment you can , wear a helmet whenever possible and , if you 're a snowboarder , get yourself a pair of good quality wrist guards , " he emphasized again			0
with an estimated 200 million skiers and 70 million snowboarders in the world today , there are plenty of people who would do well to heed this advice and his overall message is that responsible participants have nothing more to fear on the slopes in comparison to other sporting activities .			2
