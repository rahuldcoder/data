-- it may have taken 260 years but the home of golf is finally preparing to allow women to join its ranks			1
the @entity6 of @entity7 , which was established in 1764 and serves as golf 's governing body outside of the @entity10 and @entity11 , has faced growing criticism for its all - male policy			1
a ballot will be held in september , with 2,500 members expected to ratify the proposal			0
the @entity17 says it hopes the resolution will pass with the required two - thirds majority			2
" the club 's committees are strongly in favor of the rule change and are asking members to support it , " a spokesperson told @entity0			0
speaking to @entity0 in july last year , @entity17 chief executive @entity27 insisted the single - sex policy of clubs such as 2013 @entity31 open host venue @entity32 -- and others -- was a historic hangover			1
he told reporters at wednesday 's announcement of the september vote : " it 's something that has been expected ; i 'm not going to say overdue but i 'm sure i 'll be asked that question			0
" early indications from the members are very positive indeed			0
we have been talking about this for quite a while and it 's our governance role which has been the driving factor			0
" society is changing , sport is changing , golf is changing and i think it 's appropriate for a governing body to take this step			1

the move by the @entity17 brings it in line with @entity68 , which allowed female members to join the prestigious @entity10 club for the first time in 80 years in 2012			1
@entity68 , which hosts the masters , faced years of protests with president @entity74 also adding pressure on the organization			0
