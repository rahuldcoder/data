but " @entity22 was the drive of this revolution			1
everybody was on @entity22 ... if these protests started five years ago , they would have died			2
" president @entity30 @entity29 's departure followed weeks of protests over what @entity2 said were poor living conditions , high unemployment , government corruption and repression			2
@entity37 , a @entity2 native living in @entity39 , and a group of @entity2 friends held up signs at @entity22 's headquarters in @entity44 , @entity39 , on saturday to " thank @entity22 for enabling our nation ( both inside and outside the country ) to freely share their opinion online , bridging our way to democracy			1
