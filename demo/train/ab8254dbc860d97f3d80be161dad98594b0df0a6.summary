-- a @entity2 toddler has died of enterovirus @entity3 , another reminder of the deadly potential of a disease that has infected hundreds nationwide in two months			1
@entity8 died at @entity9 , where she had been transferred " for advanced services , " according to the @entity13 hospital 's chief medical officer , dr. @entity11			1
" the @entity14 confirmed @entity15 after her arrival here , and she subsequently succumbed to her illness , " @entity11 said			1
a @entity20 page , dubbed " @entity21 ! , " devoted to the 21 - month - old 's plight also confirmed the sad news			0
" @entity8 became our angel at 2:55 p.m. ( friday ) , " read one post			1
" she passed peacefully in her mother and father 's arms			0
" the little girl 's death spurred an outpouring of condolences online , from " rest in peace sweet baby girl " to " enjoy your wings			2
" one of them read : " your daughter touched more lives than you 'll probably ever know			0
may your @entity43 rest now			0
" @entity44 is very common , with the @entity14 estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the @entity46			1
but like the flu or other viruses , not all the roughly 100 enterovirus strains are the same			2
authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illness			1
it seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems			2
yet there are exceptions , such as a 4 - year - old from @entity63 , @entity64 , who went to bed " asymptomatic and fine " only to be found dead the next morning , said @entity66 , @entity63 health officer			0
boy went to bed fine , did n't wake up -- due to enterovirus @entity3 @entity44 may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity2			1
doctors in @entity72 spotted it first : a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness , cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter staff at @entity83 have since identified four patients with the same symptoms			0
and a child in @entity87 , @entity2 , has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus , according to the @entity91			0
parents growing anxious about enterovirus @entity15 as of friday , the @entity14 and state public health laboratories had documented 691 cases of enterovirus @entity15 in 46 states and the @entity97			1
five patients who died had the virus strain , even if it 's not certain all of them died because of it			1
@entity8 's case is not yet counted in this tally			1
there will be more cases , and perhaps more deaths , in the coming weeks , officials said			0
part of this has to do with a backlog on samples , with the @entity14 explaining " it can take a while ... because the testing is complex and slower and can only be done by ( the ) @entity14 and a small number of state public health laboratories			2
" the virus also has not yet run its course			0
as the @entity14 pointed out , " enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall			2
we 're currently in the middle of the enterovirus season			0
" @entity0 's @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
