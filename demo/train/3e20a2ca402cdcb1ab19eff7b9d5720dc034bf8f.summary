@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 attempted attack by would - be " underwear bomber " @entity6 provoked the @entity8 government to plan to spend $ 1 billion for full body scanners and other bomb - detecting devices at airports			1
that 's a substantial cost , and it does n't include the extra wait time passengers will spend in security lines , or the distasteful invasiveness of the scanners			1
is the extra security worth it ? much of the cost of the horrendous attacks on 9/11 was indirect and , in a sense , self - inflicted			1
@entity24 of the @entity26 's @entity25 at the @entity27 directed a careful study			0
one of its most striking findings was that the standard economic costs of the 9/11 attacks , estimated at $ 25 billion , were exceeded by the costs of behavioral reactions far from the site of the attack			1
more specifically , the @entity8 economy lost an additional $ 85 billion or so because @entity8 chose not to fly			1
the decrease in demand for air travel , and thus use of hotels and other tourism costs , lasted for almost two years , triggering airline bankruptcies and eventually forcing the @entity8 government to bail out airlines			1
a full accounting of the damage would include the losses at tourist destinations in other countries , lost vacations and lost visits with family and friends			2
so $ 85 billion is probably an underestimation			1
those " self - inflicted " costs amounted to about three - quarters of a percent of @entity8 gdp , the difference between a quick recovery and a prolonged recession			2
they were mostly because of what we now know was misplaced fear about the terrorism risk associated with air travel			1
flying was actually much safer than the dissuaded passengers thought			0
in retrospect , nobody made themselves safer by not flying , since there was no successful second attack over the two years of low demand			0
the one attempted attack , by shoe bomber @entity78 in december 2001 , was easily foiled by passengers and crew members			0
the lesson here is clear			0
it is not enough for the @entity85 administration to make air travel safe , it must also control the tendency of the public to exaggerate the risk of terrorism			1
to put that risk in perspective : traffic accidents in the @entity8 annually account for about 150 times as many avoidable deaths as there were passengers on @entity97 from @entity98			2
avoidable deaths due to tobacco use and unhealthy diets annually account for 3,000 times as many			0
yet the traveling public requires constant reassurance			0
full body scanners are a very visible means of protection that help convince travelers that the danger is small			0
the public 's exaggerated perception of the risk in flying provides terrorist organizations with disproportionate political leverage			2
this is a mechanism that terrorists exploit			0
overreacting to fear over an extremely improbable , albeit horrific , event can severely amplify the damage			0
keeping the true level of danger in perspective is therefore an important component of counterterrorism , especially in an economically critical sector such as air travel			1
an expensive defensive response is thus economically justifiable , even if it seems excessive and intrusive			0
president @entity85 was criticized in the press for not responding more forcefully to an egregious attempted attack carried out against civilians on a national holiday			2
instead he seemed to focus on the security lapse and how to improve security coordination			0
that may not have been the populist choice -- it would have been far more satisfying to hear the president lash out at @entity137			1
yet his measured response did seem to reassure the traveling public about the true risk associated with air travel : the @entity143 index of airline stocks , which fell by 40.3 percent in september 2001 , dropped by only 1.7 percent the day after @entity3 , and had recovered completely by the first week in january , as had the stock of the airline itself			1
it must have been awfully disappointing for @entity6 's handlers back in @entity150 to see how @entity8 travelers brushed off the threat			2
the administration 's handling of the @entity3 attack may get a c in populist politics , but it gets an a in the economics of counterterrorism			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 and @entity166 .			2

**authors** : @entity8 economy lost $ 85 billion after 9/11 because @entity8 chose not to fly
@entity171 , @entity166 : fears of air travel are exaggerated , giving terrorists leverage
extra security justified if only to allay fears , get @entity8 in the air again , they write
**authors** : @entity85 did n't lash out at @entity137 , as some wanted , but made a good economic move
