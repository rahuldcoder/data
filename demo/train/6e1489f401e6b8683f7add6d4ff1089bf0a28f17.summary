-- there are few places in the world which can claim to be more romantic than @entity4			0
a glance across the @entity6 , a walk though the @entity9 hand in hand with a loved one , 37 bridges to pause and take a breath at the beauty of an enchanting city			0
artists sitting at every corner beckoning you for a portrait , the music which fills the air , the sheer smell of history which touches every sinew			0
there are the book markets which entice you with that precious thought of sipping a coffee at a trendy cafe , while you sit engrossed in a work of literary art. tourists flock from around the world to see the @entity31 , to take in the @entity33 renovation and to bend down on one knee and ask that question			0
there 's the @entity38 bridge , linking @entity39 where @entity40 is buried , right through to @entity41 and the shopping heaven of the @entity43			0
do n't forget the @entity44 , allowing you to walk between @entity46 and the @entity47 without the constant noise of traffic			0
why not stay a while ? enjoy a fine bottle of wine , a picnic perhaps ? or maybe you 'd rather save yourself for a jaunt across the @entity55 and steal a kiss ? this is @entity4 , the romantic capital of @entity59 and perhaps the world			0
but on sunday january 6 2013 , @entity4 surrendered its crown , or at least for a few hours temporarily			0
away from the boutiques , the patisseries , the artists of @entity65 , @entity4 had been eclipsed by a group of men , who have taken the whole notion of romance to a new level			0
step forward the brave and hardy souls of @entity72			1
in a small and sleepy town in the north - east of the country , around 311 kilometers from the capital , something has stirred			2
there are no candle lit dinners or boutique bistros , instead it is a place known for three things -- the cold , the @entity72 print and now , at last , its football team			1
it was here that the romance of the @entity88 domestic @entity59 was realized , not through poetry , painting or drama			1
this grew out of passion			0
@entity72 , a third - tier side , which sits 19th out of 20 teams in its division , had dreamed of this day for many a year although that dream was tempered with more than a hint of apprehension			1
the arrival of cup holder @entity99 and its millionaire football players would have left even the most rose tinted of @entity72 supporters reaching for a nice bottle of rouge			1
@entity99 , the seven - time league champion , a team playing at the pinnacle of @entity110 football in the @entity111 , arrived at @entity112 re second in the top division			1
after holding a training camp in the luxurious surrounding of @entity117 and all the glitz and glamor that goes with it , this game was supposed to ease the team back into the routine following the winter break			0
while @entity99 's players have been busy wiping the sweat from their brow and basking in the exotic temperatures of the @entity128 , @entity72 's players were trying to fit the rigors of training into everyday life			1
@entity72 is an amateur team , its players work in all sections of society and train when their jobs allow			1
it is not the life their opponent endures			0
for once , work took a back seat as the romance of the cup swept across the town and those who live there			2
as the two teams took to the field , the millionaire international footballers of @entity99 and the dreamers of @entity72 , what chance would the home side have afforded themselves ? @entity88 football has seen fairy tales in the past			1
only last season , @entity155 of the third tier reached the final where it was beaten narrowly by @entity99			1
in 2009 , @entity159 of the second division , defeated @entity161 , while other teams outside the top flight such as @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 have all reached the final in recent time			1
" there is always a story every year , " @entity88 football expert @entity170 told @entity0			1
" we had @entity155 last year which was a wonderful story and then in previous years we 've had @entity166 and others			0
" there are a lot more upsets in the @entity59 , but this one is absolutely huge			0
it took the amateurs of @entity72 just 13 minutes to move into a two - goal lead thanks to @entity183			1
his double strike allowed not just a town , but an entire country to dream			0
this was the day when @entity72 allowed @entity59 to fall in love with another minnow			1
like any romance , there are rocky moments			0
two of those came within the next seven minutes as @entity99 drew level			1
the dream looked like it had died when @entity198 converted a penalty to leave @entity72 's hopes in tatters with just 28 minutes remaining			2
not since the 18th century had so many printing presses been ready to illustrate the efforts of @entity72			2
famed for its printing cards of saints , wars and fairy tales , the town was about to receive a new legend to add to the list			0
it was he who scored a precious equalizer with 13 minutes remaining to take the tie into extra-time and eventually came penalties			1
and so it came down to the dreaded spot kicks			0
many a man has crumbled under the pressure of trying to beat a goalkeeper from 12 - yards			2
far greater players than those of @entity225 have lost their nerve and fallen into the abyss			2
but in @entity228 , @entity72 had its hero			2
the goalkeeper ensured his face will be forever remembered on a picture card , saving a penalty to help bring down the might of @entity99			2
who said romance was dead ? " it 's a really big shock , " @entity237 , former director of football at @entity117 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 told @entity0			2
" @entity99 has been playing very well this season and it 's the first really big negative result they 've had all season			1
" the league title is almost guaranteed to @entity248 and there are only a couple of other trophies for other teams to win			0
" @entity99 wanted to win this cup and for them to lose is a huge blow , it 's a massive shock			1
" @entity72 are part - time and have jobs which allow them to train , they 're a small team			1
now , the focus on the club will be huge			0
" while @entity72 's players bask in the limelight of its victory , it 's unlikely that the town will rival @entity4 for romance in the long term			1
the romance of the @entity59 has been rekindled in a quiet town in the east of the country			0
for now , let @entity72 have its day .			2
