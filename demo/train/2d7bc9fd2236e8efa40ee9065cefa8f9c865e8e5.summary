@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 leaders do n't see eye to eye on much these days			1
but political veterans on both sides of the aisle do agree on one point -- the stakes are high in the rapidly approaching 2014 midterm races			0
for @entity3 , the midterms are all about holding their slim @entity14 majority and , if possible , defying historical odds by retaking the @entity16			2
they want to give president @entity18 a working congressional majority for his last two years in office to help secure his legacy and lay the best possible groundwork for the party 's standard bearer in 2016			1
for @entity4 , it 's the polar opposite			0
2014 is all about finally realizing their maddeningly elusive goal of recapturing the @entity14 while also boosting their @entity16 majority , ensuring @entity18 's a powerless lame duck , and pounding away at presidential accomplishments like the @entity31 in the run - up to 2016			1
poll : voters split over @entity4 , @entity3 in 2014 which party will come out on top next year ? it 's too early to know			1
but here are seven key factors to keep in mind : 1			0
@entity31 @entity4 have promised to keep this issue front and center throughout 2014			2
and the botched rollout of the @entity44 website -- combined with news of canceled insurance policies and problems with the new exchanges -- has given the @entity50 plenty of ammunition			2
the number of @entity53 citing health care as the country 's biggest problem recently jumped seven percentage points -- from 12 % in october to 19 % in november -- according to @entity58			2
meanwhile , the public 's opinion of @entity31 has soured			1
net disapproval of @entity31 jumped from three points ( 44 % approval versus 47 % disapproval ) in october to 15 points ( 40 % approval versus 55 % disapproval ) in november , according to @entity58			1
@entity68 defends @entity31 claims , ca n't predict effect on 2014 this month , @entity3 came close to losing a gubernatorial race in @entity72 that most analysts believed they 'd win easily			1
why ? part of the reason appeared to be @entity31 's sinking numbers			1
more than a quarter of @entity72 voters said health care -- a traditional @entity3 strength -- was their most important issue			1
they narrowly broke for the @entity4 nominee			0
thirty - nine of them voted last week for a @entity50 bill that would let insurers continue to offer policies not in compliance with the minimum standards outlined in the @entity31			1
@entity31 rattles @entity3 with midterms looming " even if the @entity18 administration fixes @entity31 in the near term or before november 2014 , this ineptitude ... has shaken voter confidence in government to its core , " said @entity94 political scientist @entity93			1
" @entity3 have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns			1
i believe that strategy is now threatened and the @entity3 will have to work on their policy messaging for november 2014 if they want to hang onto the @entity14			2
" @entity50 taints 2014 democrats with @entity18 health care pledge 2			2
shutdown fatigue how badly did the @entity4 hurt itself during the recent government shutdown ? for the first time since the @entity50 won back the @entity16 in 2010 , a majority of @entity53 said in mid-october they believe @entity50 control of the @entity16 is bad for the country			1
a majority of @entity53 -- 54 % -- had a negative view of @entity4 control of the @entity16 , up 11 points since last year , according to a @entity1 / @entity121 poll			0
the question now is whether voters ' collective memory of the shutdown has been eclipsed by @entity31 's problems			1
" the @entity50 has to avoid the kinds of disastrous politics that surrounded the recent government shutdown and debt ceiling fights , " @entity93 said			1
" they have to appear more rational , reasoned and caring as a national party			0
" " ironically , " she added , " the @entity50 leadership looks more justified ( now ) in calling for a delay in @entity31 but their tactics were so extreme that voters are still wary of them			1
" @entity50 congressional leaders are promising there wo n't be another shutdown , but will they be able to control their rank and file ? and if they ca n't , will that play into @entity3 charges that the @entity50 is now a party under the control of its extreme fringe ? 3			1
the economy it seems like common sense			0
if your bank account 's hurting , the president 's party is hurting			1
if you 're doing well , the president 's party does well			1
except that this is n't always the case			0
@entity158 ' @entity157 said it best four years ago : " is the president pursuing an unpopular war and controversial policies at home ( @entity164 in 1966 , @entity165 in 2006 ) ? then it probably does n't matter that the economy is blazing ahead			0
is the president waging a successful war and getting ready to take out a longtime nemesis ( @entity165 in 2002 ) ? the public is going to be more forgiving of the sluggish growth in real disposable income and rising unemployment			0
" the bottom line is that every election becomes something of an explainable , unique event			0
" that said , some of the worst midterm losses for the president 's party -- 1930 , 1938 , 1946 , 1958 , 1974 , 1982 , 2010 -- occurred during or shortly after a downturn			1
" a bad recession occurring close to a midterm election is n't a necessary condition for a disastrous midterm election , but it seems to be sufficient , " @entity157 notes			0
there are special factors at play in every election cycle , but all things being equal the @entity3 should be in better shape if the economy 's in better shape			1
republicans should be in better shape if the economy 's in worse shape			0
no. 2 @entity198 says @entity50 could easily lose @entity16 4			2
six - year itch one of the biggest factors working in the @entity50 's favor next year could be the simple fact that @entity53 are ready for a change six years into a @entity3 presidency			1
the president 's party almost always loses congressional seats in the sixth year of his term			1
the one recent exception to this rule came in 1998 , in the midst of an apparent voter backlash against the @entity214 impeachment			0
could @entity50 overreach on @entity31 or other issues create the perfect storm for another exception in 2014 ? 5			1
gerrymandering in the @entity16 while all 435 @entity16 seats are up in 2014 , the reality is that the overwhelming majority of those seats will not be seriously contested			0
the art of gerrymandering has evolved into a virtual science over the last couple of decades , leading to greater incumbent protection and a much smaller political playing field			0
@entity1 has tentatively identified 45 @entity16 races to watch in 2014 -- 25 @entity3 seats and 20 @entity4 seats			2
given the fact that the @entity3 now hold 200 seats ( 201 assuming they hold @entity236 's open @entity235 seat ) , virtually everything would have to break the @entity3 ' way for them to recapture the @entity16			1
who turns out ? midterm turnout is typically lower , which translates to whiter , older , and more @entity4			0
@entity241 constituencies are more likely to turn out at the midterm polls			0
take a look , for example , at the most recent two election cycles			0
the electorate in 2012 was 72 % white , 16 % age 65 or older and 53 % @entity248			0
forty - two percent of voters attended religious services weekly			2
in 2010 , the electorate was 77 % white , 21 % age 65 or older and 55 % @entity248			0
forty - eight percent of voters attended religious services weekly			2
all four of these groups vote solidly @entity4			0
if 2014 turns out to be a " typical " midterm in this respect , it will be a critical advantage for the @entity4			0
electability versus purity republicans have been burned over the last couple of election cycles by primaries that led to the nomination of sub-par general election candidates			0
in 2010 , the @entity50 blew great opportunities to win @entity3 @entity14 seats in @entity266 , @entity267 , and @entity268 when they nominated three tea party favorites -- @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity272 -- who subsequently stumbled and proved unacceptable to larger general election electorates			1
in 2012 , the @entity4 tossed away a safe @entity50 seat when six - term moderate sen. @entity275 lost his primary fight to more conservative state treasurer @entity277			2
@entity3 pounced on remarks @entity277 made during the general election suggesting that pregnancies resulting from rape are " something @entity283 intended			2
" the seat was ultimately won by @entity3 nominee @entity285			2
in @entity286 , @entity4 lost a golden opportunity to oust vulnerable @entity3 sen. @entity288 last year when @entity50 nominee rep. @entity289 declared that in instances of " legitimate rape " a woman 's body " has ways to try to shut that whole thing down			1
" @entity288 trounced @entity289 by roughly 15 points			0
in 2014 , @entity50 primary voters will help decide more @entity14 and @entity16 where conservative tea party candidates have been pitted against @entity4 establishment types			1
one of the most notable of these contests is happening in @entity301 , where @entity14 minority leader @entity302 is facing off against tea party favorite @entity303			0
this is not to say that the establishment choice is always the best one for @entity4			0
and the grassroots energy provided by tea party activists is critical to @entity50 chances			2
but the lesson of recent cycles should n't be ignored in 2014			0
battle for the @entity16 in 2014 : obamacare vs. shutdown			0

@entity31 *fiasco* has shaken voter confidence in @entity3 ' government solutions
will voters ' memories of october shutdown be eclipsed by @entity31 a year from now ?
worst losses have occurred to president 's party during or shortly after economic *slowdown*
could @entity50 overreach on @entity31 or other issues break cycle of six - year itch ?
