@entity0 -- if you 're one of the millions of @entity3 who get even a portion of your electric power from a nuclear generating plant , for more than three decades you 've been paying a tax , whether you realize it or not , to fund the storage of nuclear waste from that plant in a safe place			1
collected at an estimated $ 750 million a year , the @entity14 now says this so - called " nuclear waste fund " amounts to close to $ 30 billion			1
and it is not being used to pay for the storage of a single ounce of spent nuclear fuel			1
" the government has made much more of a mess than it should have been , " @entity20 , a @entity0 lawyer , told @entity1			0
@entity20 represents many of the nation 's biggest nuclear power companies and for more than 20 years , he 's been involved in lawsuits against the government , trying to make it pay for what he says it promised to do way back in 1982			2
" that program , when it was set up , was supposed to be science - based , " he says			0
at one point , all of the nation 's spent nuclear fuel -- at least the spent fuel used for commercial power generation -- was supposed to end up at a bleak spot in @entity41 , about 90 miles north of @entity42 , called @entity43			1
since the project began , the government has spent close to $ 11 billion in construction , engineering and scientific studies and there have been several blue ribbon commissions examining the safety of @entity43 to hold all that waste			1
what happened ? " rather than let the science take its course , politics has interfered and the plug has been pulled on @entity43 , at least so far , " @entity20 told @entity1			0
and by politics , he means politics at the highest level			0
almost from the start , @entity41 politicians said they wanted nothing to do with the @entity64			0
but it was n't until @entity66 began his presidential campaign that @entity41 's opposition gained serious traction			2
@entity66 wrote to a @entity42 newspaper , @entity70 , in the spring of 2007 saying he had " always " been against storing nuclear waste at @entity43			1
and then after he became president , @entity66 killed nearly all of the essential government funds for @entity43			2
and he did one more thing			0
@entity66 appointed @entity76 as chairman of the @entity78 , the government agency with the power to regulate the nation 's nuclear plants and with oversight over @entity43			1
@entity83 ( pronounced " @entity84 " ) served for years as chief of staff to senate majority leader @entity86 of @entity41 , who vowed never to allow @entity43 to proceed			0
the offices of sen. @entity86 and @entity76 told @entity1 that the nation 's spent nuclear fuel is safe right where it is , strung out across 65 storage sites nationwide			1
that spent fuel ... tiny uranium pellets surrounded by steel rods coated with a zirconium alloy all packaged in a highly engineered assembly ... now totals more than 70,000 tons nationwide			2
two thirds of that spent fuel , according to the @entity14 , is now in pools under about 40 feet of water			2
some anti nuclear organizations say those pools are too jammed with spent fuel rods and are vulnerable to accident or terrorist attack			1
the nuclear industry says the spent fuel is safe and @entity78 officials say they believe the spent fuel can be reliably stored where it is for another 40 years			1
@entity1 wanted to visit @entity43 to see what 's become of the project			2
the most recent television footage available of @entity43 was taken in 2002			0
but officials from the @entity115 , which oversees @entity43 , declined , citing safety reasons			0
some @entity118 members of @entity119 say they , too , were blocked in an attempt to visit @entity43			0
at a @entity122 hearing this week in @entity0 , sen. @entity123 , @entity124 , pointedly told @entity78 chairman @entity76 that it was " important to ask about @entity43			0
" " we have collected $ 30 billion to pay for an eventual disposal , " he said			1
" why not use it ? "			0

@entity3 's nuclear waste fund has close to $ 30 billion
@entity66 opposes @entity43 site for nuclear storage
spent fuel is stored in 65 storage sites
