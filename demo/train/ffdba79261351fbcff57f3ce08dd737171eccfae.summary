@entity0 the face of @entity0 's chief executive covers the toilet paper and @entity6 's leader lingers next to you in the shower			1
safe to say -- it 's not your average hotel			1
tucked away in an apartment building on a quiet side street of @entity0 's busy @entity16 district , this small hotel is a shrine to the @entity18			1
freelance translator @entity19 rented the apartment in early december , in the same week that police began clearing out the city 's pro-democracy protest sites			1
" i literally got the keys and then the next day i went down to @entity25 ( the main protest site ) and the police were coming and i just grabbed as much as i could , " says @entity19			0
posters , artwork and memorabilia from all three main protest sites now plaster every inch of the 600 square foot abode			2
rows of construction helmets are mounted neatly on the wall , gas masks hang like ornaments around a door frame , newspaper clippings wallpaper the kitchen and a yellow umbrella serves a partial curtain , shielding the living room from the sun. " i had the idea at first of an exhibition , " @entity19 says , " and then when they ( police ) gave me the tents i thought , well , i 'll put the tents in here too			0
" and the idea for @entity54 was born			1
for as little as hk $ 78 ( $ 10 ) per night , guests can pay via a listing on @entity57 to sleep in an original occupy tent			1
the two - bedroom apartment accommodates a total of eight , @entity19 says , but five is the most he 's rented at once			1
each tent is adorned with a name relating to the movement , such as " @entity64 " and " @entity65			2
" @entity66 , 26 , followed the @entity0 protests from his hometown of @entity69 , @entity70 , and recently extended his visit at the hotel			1
" i had a look online			0
there are cheaper places to stay , but i thought this would just be more interesting			0
it 's an experience worth having and it 's a cause worth supporting , " says @entity66			0
visitors from @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 round out some of the hotel 's other recent occupants			2
@entity19 says he has also hosted guests from mainland @entity6 , but only after they sent him messages saying they opposed @entity87 rule			0
originally from @entity88 , @entity19 describes himself as a " white - skinned @entity6 dissident			0
" a fluent @entity91 speaker and writer , he spent three decades in and out of @entity6 before the government threatened to revoke his visa for writing politically critical articles			0
he has been living in @entity0 for eight years now -- and hoping to gain permanent residency soon			2
" i feel @entity0 is a kind of bubble of freedom and human rights in @entity6 , " he says , which is why he found the 11 - week - long , pro-democracy demonstrations so inspirational			1
@entity103 , 29 , watched the occupy movement with interest from afar			0
he says the @entity6 university where he teaches @entity107 and history forbade him to come to @entity0 to see the protests in person , which is why he is now staying at the hotel			1
" it 's always good to have people like @entity19 who keep the memory , " @entity103 says			2
" in @entity6 , students do n't know what happened in ( the @entity119 incident in ) 1989 , because all the memories have been deleted			0
" preserving the memory and keeping the democracy movement alive is something the 50 - year - old @entity19 says he is passionate about			0
however , the @entity124 requires anyone running a guesthouse to apply for a special permit from the @entity128 -- something @entity19 says he does n't need to do , because he is selective about who he allows to stay			0
despite questions over the legality of his venture , @entity19 says he hopes to eventually open up two more occupy - themed hotels - one for each of the main protest sites			2
until then , pro-democracy supporters can continue reliving the protests in a tiny @entity16 apartment - having their own movement against @entity0 's chief executive @entity141 , one flush at a time .			1

@entity145 opened up the small hotel using memorabilia from @entity0 's @entity54 protests
for as little as $ 10 per night , guests can pay to sleep in an original occupy tent
