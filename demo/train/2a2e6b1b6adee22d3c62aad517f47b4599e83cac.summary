he was an acclaimed film director			0
she , a 13 - year - old girl , working on a modeling job in @entity5			0
the decision by @entity7 to have sex with @entity9 was one that continues to dog him nearly four decades later			1
" it was 1977 and i had a modeling job with @entity7 and at the very end of that he took advantage of me and made me have sex with him , " @entity12 said			1
at the time , @entity7 pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sex with a minor			1
but the filmmaker fled the @entity22 before he could be sentenced			2
now , after a @entity25 prosecutor last month asked a regional court in @entity27 to consider whether to extradite him to the @entity22 , his case is being heard by a court there			1
@entity7 appeared in court wednesday to give evidence , following an opening statement from the prosecutor , court spokeswoman @entity29 told @entity1			1
the court was closed to the media wednesday but will be open for any further hearings , she said			0
@entity1 's @entity25 affiliate @entity36 reported the hearing was later postponed until april			1
part of the reason , @entity36 reported , was the arrival of new documents concerning the @entity22 ' attempt to have the director extradited from @entity44 in 2009			1
many of the documents , which arrived on tuesday , are in @entity46 , meaning that the @entity47 is obliged to translate them			0

on more than one occasion , his victim has called for the charges against him to be dropped			0
" @entity7 went to jail for 42 days , " @entity12 said			2
" i never asked anyone to put him in jail for a day and in the scheme of things , from what i have been told , in 1977 , 42 days would have been about average			0
" however , i think that was a lot , plus he was arrested again and went to jail for months again -- that 's way in excess of anything he deserved			0
" @entity7 has also been vocal about the scandal			2
in the 2008 @entity91 documentary " @entity93 and @entity94 , " he explained his actions			0
" well , i like young women , let 's put it this way , and i think most men do actually , " he said			0
while on the run , @entity7 has continued to make films and win accolades , including an @entity103 for " @entity104 " and nominations for " @entity106 " and " @entity107			2
" the famed director has both @entity67 and @entity25 citizenship , and he is working on another movie in @entity25 , his parents ' homeland , this spring			0
