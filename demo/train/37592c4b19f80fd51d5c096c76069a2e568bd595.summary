-- @entity3 will appeal a judge 's decision to overturn the murder conviction and death sentence of @entity8 , the state 's attorney general announced friday			1
a jury convicted @entity8 of murder , conspiracy to commit murder , child abuse and kidnapping on october 12 , 1990 , less than a year after her 4 - year - old son was found dead			1
she was sentenced to death a few months later			0
but on thursday , chief judge @entity17 of the 9th @entity18 overturned her conviction after determining she did not receive a fair trial			0
his rationale was that prosecutors did not disclose the " history of misconduct " of its key witness , a @entity26 police detective , who had testified that @entity8 confessed to being involved in a plot to kill her son			1
unbeknownst to the defense or to the jury , previous judges had tossed out four confessions or indictments because detective @entity34 had lied under oath , among other issues			2
@entity3 woman 's murder conviction , death sentence overturned but @entity3 attorney general @entity40 challenged @entity17 's decision , vowing friday to personally argue on the state 's behalf if the @entity45 @entity44 takes the appeal			1
" ms. @entity8 was found to have arranged the killing of her own son , a four - year - old toddler , because he was too much of a burden and interfering with her life , " @entity40 said in a written statement			2
" ... this is a horrible crime			0
the @entity54 's decision needs to be reversed , and justice for @entity56 needs to be served			0
" a day after seeing @entity58 at a mall , young @entity57 asked his mother if he could go again			0
that was the plan , she said , when the boy got into the car with @entity8 's roommate , @entity64			2
@entity64 picked up a friend , " but instead of heading to the mall , the two men drove the boy out of town to a secluded ravine , where @entity64 shot @entity56 three times in the head , " according to @entity17 's summary of the case			0
@entity64 was convicted of first - degree murder in the boy 's killing and sentenced to death			2
during her trial , " no ... witnesses or direct evidence ( linked ) @entity81 to the crime " other than @entity34 the detective questioned @entity8 -- an interrogation that was n't recorded or witnessed by anyone else -- and later claimed she 'd confessed to her role in the murder conspiracy , saying it was a " bad judgment call			1
" but @entity8 offered a vastly different view of the interrogation and denied that she had admitted to any role in a murder plot			0
" the judge and jury believed @entity34 , " @entity17 wrote thursday			0
" but they did n't know about @entity34 's long history of lying under oath and other misconduct			2
" @entity17 , chiding prosecutors for remaining " unconstitutionally silent " about the detective 's background , overturned the conviction and set the stage for @entity8 's release from prison unless the state quickly presses forward with a retrial			1
@entity40 , the @entity3 attorney general , argues that the 49 - year - old woman should remain on death row , given his understanding of what happened			1
" after dressing him up and telling him he was going to the mall to see @entity58 , @entity8 was convicted of sending her young son off to be shot , execution style , in a desert wash , " he said			1
@entity0 's @entity119 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 was convicted of murder in her son 's death and given the death *penalty*
a judge tossed her conviction ; the jury did n't know a detective 's " history of misconduct "
@entity3 's attorney general says he *'ll* appeal the case to the @entity45 @entity44
@entity8 sent " her young son off to be shot , executive style , " the attorney general says
