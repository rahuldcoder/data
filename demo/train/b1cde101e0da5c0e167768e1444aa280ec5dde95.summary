-- there was a time when @entity4 's beachfront was just another neighborhood sandwiched between the city 's bustling @entity7 port district and historic old town			1
today the area is home to some of @entity16 's most sought - after luxury real estate and has been dubbed the " @entity15 " thanks to the rocketing cost of living space			1
a seventeenth floor apartment of 600 square meters ( 6,420 square feet ) here sold for $ 23 million recently , a record for @entity4			1
in the same area , a rented unit of 300 square meters ( 3,228 square feet ) is on the market for $ 10 million			0
these premium prices represent a big change for a city that was brought to its knees due by large debts at the end of the 1990s			1
in the last four years alone , however , the waterfront property market has generated nearly half a billion dollars of investment			1

it was here that architects @entity41 and @entity43 won the contract to renovate a huge space that had sat idle for 50 years			2
the pair quickly set about creating quirky living and work space for the city 's hip up - and - comers			2

" old empty warehouses in @entity59 are now filled with creative types and cutting edge retailers			0
one of these young merchants is @entity63 , owner of the city 's first organic market			2
although initially skeptical about setting up shop in an old industrial space , he now sees the virtue of the location			0
" at the beginning the port felt to me like too isolated ... too far from the vibrance ( sic ) and power of the city , " @entity63 said			0
" but looking back it was really a perfect choice			0
" see also : could micro-homes offer big solution ? the lively , can do vibe of @entity79 has since spread to other areas of the city , including the beachfront			1
but while the most lucrative properties may reside by the sea , the high end market can be found spreading to other districts as well			0
@entity88 , an old fishing neighborhood to the city 's south now hosts properties valued as high as $ 5 million apiece			2
according to the city 's mayor , @entity95 , however , @entity4 's fundamental landscape and attractions are what continue make it such an appealing place to live whether that be in a luxury abode or not			1
" we have an excellent beach , excellent weather excellent food , restaurants , " @entity95 said			0
" why not ( have ) people coming here to enjoy themselves ? "			0
