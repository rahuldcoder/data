president @entity10 has been under fire over accusations the government initially ignored and then later downplayed the abduction of the girls , who have become the focal point of a social media campaign demanding their safe return			1
" the president and the government ( are ) not taking this as easy as people all over the world think , " @entity19 , a spokesman for @entity10 told @entity20			1
" we 've done a lot -- but we are not talking about it			0

" in detailing the government 's response , two special battalions have been devoted to the search for the missing girls , @entity19 said			1
that includes 250 locations that have been searched by helicopters and airplanes			0
it was unclear whether these were additional troops being dispatched or were forces already in place			0
