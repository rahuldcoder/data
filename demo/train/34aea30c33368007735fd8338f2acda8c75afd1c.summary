-- this weekend 's kick - off at the 28th @entity2 launches a three - week explosion of color and noise in the soccer - crazy continent			1
the tournament is set to transfix the region as 16 teams go head - to - head to be crowned footballing kings of @entity13 , but there is also a tinge of trepidation in the air			2
that 's because the 2010 installment in @entity20 was overshadowed by a machine gun attack on the @entity23 team bus that left three people dead and organizers -- the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) -- having to defend the decision to stage it there			1
this year 's co-hosts @entity29 and @entity31 are the smallest nations ever to hold the event -- which is also known as @entity2 -- giving rise to concerns about security , as well as travel and tourism infrastructure			1
@entity0 examines the complex nature of the event , investigating the issues on and off the field			2
the hosts oil - rich @entity29 and @entity31 are the smallest countries ever to ever host the @entity2 , with a combined population of just over two million			1
the fact they were chosen underlines the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) policy to use the tournament as an investment tool , hoping to drive tourism and business long after the soccer extravaganza has gone			2
" it is only the second time that @entity13 has the honor to host the most prestigious competition on the continent			1
the first time was 40 years ago in my country , @entity62 , " @entity26 spokesman @entity59 told @entity0			1
" it has become something unique allowing us to complete our major language areas ; @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 and today @entity71 with @entity29			1
" @entity72 of the co-hosts could perhaps not afford to host a competition of 16 teams alone			2
we had a first experience in 2000 ( hosted by @entity77 and @entity78 ) and it was not entirely satisfactory			2
this time the two countries have cooperated very well as evidenced by the decision to grant common visas to both countries			1
this is a great step forward			0
" but there is pressure on them to deliver a successful and safe @entity2 after 2010 's pre-tournament tragedy in @entity20 -- which had only recently emerged from a civil war lasting three decades			1
according to @entity94 football expert @entity93 , who has been to every tournament since 1992 , @entity26 's decision to take the tournament to new territories has had mixed success			1
" when you award @entity2 to places like @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity20 or @entity31 , you find that coffers for sporting infrastructure that would be normally be difficult to open suddenly emerge and you 're leaving a legacy of football infrastructure , " he told @entity0			1
" @entity26 have actively pursued that line over the last two decades , sometimes to the detriment of the tournament -- in @entity31 there is n't a hotel room for neither love nor money			1
" luckily in @entity13 there are not too many traveling fans so that 's not much of a problem , but infrastructure is poor : how do you get from one venue to the next ? " there is n't the immense pressure on traveling fans as there would be in @entity122			2
what would you rather have -- a stadium that allows a nation to participate competitively in football versus disgruntled visitors that ca n't find a hotel room for two weeks ? " the culture of chaos the deadly attack on @entity23 's team led to questions about the tournament 's organization and security , but according to @entity93 , the @entity2 ca n't be judged by similar standards to the @entity138 or the @entity139			1
" the tournament has a unique , chaotic charm , maybe that has an appeal , " he said			2
" my experience is that nothing is ever ready -- it is all a patch - up job			0
" but if the football kicks off at the appointed time , the tv cameras are in place and the whistle is blown , it does n't matter whether the accreditation machine broke down five hours before			2
" i think there 's far too much emphasis on all the other sideshows that there needs to be			0
it 's important to have the competition taking place , to have a good intensity that @entity94 football followers will enjoy			0
" @entity59 said security arrangements are the responsibility of the host nations , not the ruling body			1
" we do n't have an army to check security			0
we are a group of peaceful people who are convinced that football has to be a factor of unity , friendship and fraternity , " he told @entity0			0
" we were all ruffled by what happened in @entity20			1
it was a tragedy that touched us profoundly			0
i hope that never repeats itself			0
the opportunity there may be huge pressure on the co-hosts , but the pride they feel at staging the @entity94 soccer showcase is palpable			0
@entity31 spent an estimated $ 500 million on stadiums and infrastructure despite them being tiny in comparison to hosts of other major tournaments , like @entity192 , who spent an estimated $ 42 billion on the @entity194			2
@entity195 , from @entity31 's local organizing committee , told @entity0 that hosting of the @entity2 is " something exceptional			1
" " finally hosting the tournament means so many opportunities for @entity31 and its people , " he said			1
" when you host the @entity2 you ca n't expect benefits immediately			1
but we have built big infrastructure in terms of hosting the tournament like roads , stadiums and hotels			0
" these big investments are very important for development of our country , particularly in sports and tourism sectors			0
" " the security in @entity31 will be the best organized of any country which hosted the tournament before us			1
@entity195 also insisted there would be enough hotel rooms to accommodate the 80,000 expected visitors , as well as the many journalists descending on the competition , while the four stadiums that are hosting matches across the two countries are open and ready for kick - off			0
" i have never heard of problems without solutions , " @entity59 said			0
" in @entity13 , small problems always end up being arranged			0
" @entity26 belongs to each of the 53 national associations			0
they all have the right to bid to host without any exception			0
with each new edition of the competition , the @entity2 has become a factor of economic development in terms of structures and infrastructures			2
" we would not have had all these beautiful stadiums in @entity13 without the @entity2			2
roads have been constructed , medical facilities built , zones electrified and development of new technologies accelerated			0
it is something @entity26 can legitimately be proud of			0
" the tournament @entity2 is the planet 's third biggest football tournament , behind the @entity138 and the @entity139			1
the biennial competition is contested by 16 teams split into four groups			0
each country will host matches in two cities			2
saturday 's opening @entity259 matches will be in @entity29 's former capital @entity262 , while other games will be held in @entity264 -- its 1969 successor			1
in @entity31 a new 40,000 - seater stadium has been built in the capital @entity268 , with help from the @entity192 government , and will host the final			1
in @entity272 , the @entity272 has been refurbished to hold 35,000 spectators			0
the top two teams from each group go through to the quarterfinal stage			0
the final will be held in @entity31 's capital , @entity268 , on february 12			1
the teams the qualified nations are : group a -- @entity29 , @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 ; group b -- @entity286 , @entity287 , @entity99 , @entity20 ; @entity288 -- @entity31 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 ; @entity292 -- @entity77 , @entity293 , @entity100 , @entity29			1
there is a notable list of absentees			0
@entity297 , who won the last three titles , failed to qualify along with @entity94 heavyweights @entity62 , @entity300 and @entity78			0
the rise of @entity94 football in recent years means some of the world 's biggest soccer stars will be on show , such as the @entity286 's @entity307 striker @entity306 and @entity308 midfielder @entity309 , as well as @entity100 's @entity310 , who plays for @entity122 and @entity312 champions @entity311 .			0

@entity2 to be hosted by @entity31 and @entity29

the *duo* are the smallest countries ever to host , leading to security fears
the last tournament in @entity20 was overshadowed by a shooting on @entity23 squad
