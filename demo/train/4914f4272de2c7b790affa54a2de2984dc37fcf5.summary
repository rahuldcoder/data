-- family members of a missing @entity3 boy said they are trying to keep the focus on finding the boy and not suspicions about the boy 's stepmother			1
@entity9 , 7 , vanished on june 4 , and since then there has been intense scrutiny on @entity13 's stepmother , @entity12			1
police had asked her to take a second polygraph test in relation to the case , and other family members have said that she has not been forthcoming about what happened , based on briefings they have had from law enforcement officials			1
it is unclear why a second polygraph was requested			0
the boy 's father , biological mother and stepfather spoke to the media late monday about the stepmother and why they believe that @entity13 is still alive			2
" we remain hopeful because we have n't been given any information by law enforcement to indicate he is n't still alive and therefore we will always expect that he will come home to us , " the family said in an e-mailed response to reporters covering the case			2
@entity13 went missing after @entity12 dropped him off at school on june 4			1
the stepmother said she last saw @entity13 walking down a hallway toward his second - grade classroom at @entity45 in @entity46 , according to the police			2
police have not called her a suspect in the case but suspicions about her have dominated headlines in recent weeks			0
sources told the @entity0 affiliates that investigators believe that @entity12 has lied to them , and cell phone records could show she was n't where she claimed to be			0
in the e-mail response , @entity13 's family members said they hope people will focus more on the missing boy			1
" our main goal is to keep @entity13 in the front of everyone 's mind because we have a better chance of finding him			0
so we are constantly working to keep him the focus of the story and not @entity12 , " the family members said			1
@entity12 was again in the headlines monday when @entity72 and @entity73 reported that she had attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago			0
@entity72 reported that sources believe @entity12 approached the landscaper , who had been working on the family 's property in northwest @entity46 , and offered the man " a large sum of money " to kill her husband , @entity82			2
@entity82 and the other two family members who e-mailed reporters did not want to comment on that report			1
but they did say that they continue to feel that @entity12 is not completely cooperating with police running the search for @entity13			2
" we continue to issue our plea of her fully cooperating with law enforcement and the investigation to help bring @entity13 home as quickly as possible , " the family members said			1
however , at a news conference last week , @entity99 @entity98 said that " to date there has been no indication through our detectives or through our investigators that she 's been uncooperative , " @entity73 reported			0
repeated efforts by @entity0 to reach @entity12 have been unsuccessful			0
she has not made any other public statements			0
