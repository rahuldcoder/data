-- it 's almost mandatory that articles about @entity3 open by waxing lyrical about the land of tartan , bagpipes and heather			1
yes , it has all that , but let 's try to get beyond golf courses and kilts , and explore what else this country has to offer			0
not least is a fiery independent streak that could , depending on which way a september 18 referendum swings , see it break away from the @entity20 to become a sovereign nation			0
that would mean travelers heading there might be eligible for another stamp in their passport			0
if they do go , here 's eight things they might need to know : 1			0
@entity3 loves politics even without the independence referendum , @entity3 is extremely political			1
so @entity33 -- the colossally expensive home of the @entity35 -- is a good place to get a feel for contemporary events			2
the building still divides opinion ( go on , ask a taxi driver what he thinks of it ) , but guided tours are popular with locals and tourists -- as are the weekly shouting matches , otherwise known as first minister 's questions , that can be seen from the public gallery			0
@entity33 , @entity33 , @entity52 ; +44 131 348 5000 2			2
@entity3 's favorite dish is n't even @entity33 ... @entity54 , shortbread and scary pies are all well and good , but most @entity3 prefer to veer off the traditional menu when it comes to chow time			1
this should n't come as a surprise , particularly in multicultural @entity62 , where thousands of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity66 @entity65 have settled over the past century			0
the @entity68 subcontinent has won out with curry triumphing as the nation 's favorite dish			1
@entity62 has several top - notch curry restaurants , including mister @entity73 's in the @entity74 which , now that it 's conquered the local cuisine , is creating distinctive @entity33 - @entity79 fusion dishes , such as haggis chasni and mince and tatties ( potatoes ) curry			1
mister @entity73 's @entity79 , 149 elderslie st. , @entity62 ; +44 141 221 1452 3			1
... but its favorite drink is not all @entity3 like a drink , but whisky is perhaps @entity3 's most famous export			1
distilleries punctuate the islands , highlands and even the @entity92 of @entity3 , and they 're all happy to provide tours and tastings -- for a fee of course			1
the @entity97 off the western coast of @entity3 has no less than eight , thanks to the fertile peat bogs and pure water sources that inspired @entity103 monks to get brewing in the 14th century			2
despite its global appeal , whisky is n't actually @entity3 's favorite beverage			1
that title goes to @entity109 -- a lurid soda that can cure hangovers and , apparently , destroy carpets			1
it gave us the world 's first literary superstar born in @entity52 in 1771 , sir @entity117 was the best - selling author of historical novels such as " @entity119 , " " @entity120 , " " the @entity121 " and " @entity122			2
" all best sellers in @entity3 and across the @entity125 , they also had international reach , influencing writers in @entity128 and the @entity129			2
they 're also credited with shaping the @entity33 identity			2
the author 's recently restored country home in the @entity134 , @entity135 , is packed full of @entity117 's eclectic collection of unusual objects and historical artifacts that inspired his greatest poems and novels			0
@entity117 's @entity135 , @entity141 , @entity142 ; +44 1896 752043 5			0
its railways are amazing fans of @entity146 -- created by @entity147 , another literary superstar who 's lived in @entity3 -- will remember the scene in which a steam train transports children to @entity151 through spectacular countryside and crosses a dramatic viaduct			1
this is called @entity156 and forms part of the @entity158 running from @entity159 to @entity160			0
it even slows down so that the excitable kiddies have time to take pictures			0
stunning views also form the backdrop of rail crossings over the @entity168 and @entity169 bridges spanning waterways on @entity3 's east coast			1
the rest of the rail network is still a cheap ( ish ) way to visit almost every corner of @entity3			2
@entity177 's @entity176 gives four days ' unlimited travel on trains , ferries and some bus and coach services , while the kids go free ticket gives further discounts as well as free entry to a some of @entity3 's best attractions			1
it 's a bridge to @entity190 while the chain stores on @entity52 's @entity193 may reflect the @entity20 's commercial grip on @entity3 , its bleak , beautiful and distant islands seem to lean closer to @entity195			1
that 's likely because many were once part of the @entity200 kingdom , only becoming @entity33 after centuries of @entity190 rule			1
the @entity203 changed hands in the 13th century , followed by @entity205 and @entity206 about 200 years later , but links are still strong			0
many place names and island flags hark back to their @entity211 roots and there 's even a direct flight between the coastal @entity195 city of @entity215 and @entity206 during the summer			0
the island of @entity217 is a highlight			0
once the westernmost point of the @entity125 , this barren rock was once hope to a population with genetically large feet and prehensile toes that allowed them to clamber over its cliffs			0
@entity217 was abandoned in 1930 and a ruined village now haunts its landscape			0
@entity229 ; +44 ( 0 ) 1475 650100 7			0
@entity230 is still an issue the way some @entity3 go on about @entity230 , you 'd think the battle there took place last year , and not in 1,314 years ago			2
this was the clash that saw @entity3 's @entity239 the @entity240 lead his outnumbered army to victory against the @entity244 army of @entity245 , without a drop of @entity109 to help them			1
their tactics changed the path of @entity33 history , helping forge a spirit of independence whose endurance must partly be responsible for the current referendum -- it 's a happy coincidence for @entity33 nationalists that the vote takes place in the year of the battle 's 700th anniversary			1
clearly @entity33 memories do n't need much jogging , but there 's now help from a newly opened center that invites visitors to take their place on the battlefield and come face - to - face with the opposing kings			1
@entity230 , @entity271 , whins of @entity272 , @entity273 ; +44 844 493 2139 8			0
its summer festivals are better than its summers shivering visitors might gripe that @entity3 's summer comes and goes in the time it takes to tell a joke , but at least there 's something to laugh about			1
that 's largely thanks to the @entity284 , which every august gathers some of the world 's best gagsmiths and future stars of comedy for a cavalcade of career - defining standup shows			2
to be pedantic , there 's no such thing as the " @entity284 , " it 's actually a series of different overlapping festivals , but most locals and visitors lump them together			0
the highbrow @entity299 is the oldest , around which the lower brow @entity301 established itself			0
these have been joined by more recent additions including the middlebrow @entity304			0
locals are famously grumpy about thousands of " creatives " descending upon the @entity33 capital for a few weeks , but it 's still the best time to experience the city			1
@entity284 ; @entity310 , 4 e. market st. , @entity52 ; +44 131 529 6763 @entity312 is a @entity33 broadcaster , writer and political historian .			2

@entity3 's favorite dish is @entity79 - style curry
@entity319 is @entity3 's biggest *import* , but its favorite drink is a soda called @entity109
many of the distant @entity33 islands only became @entity33 after centuries of @entity190 rule
