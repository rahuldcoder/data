-- after two years of a virtual stalemate of progress in @entity5 , members of @entity2 are headed home for five weeks during august			1
the pressure is on for both parties to tell two very different stories to voters with only a short time before the election			1
so who will have the better narrative ? and will @entity14 listen ? voters are unhappy with everyone , which includes president @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
according to @entity24 polling average , president @entity18 's approval rating stands at 41.6 % while @entity2 approval is in the tank at 12.3 %			1
partisan warfare is a clear culprit to these low ratings			1
during august , voters should be prepared to take plenty of @entity32 , because their headaches are about to get worse			1
expect to hear @entity19 complain loudly that @entity20 are going to try to impeach @entity18 , that an attempt to sue the president is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the @entity41 decision on contraceptives			2
republicans will shout that @entity19 are driving the impeachment story to fundraise off their liberal base , that the @entity46 is obstructing progress to protect their vulnerable members in red states from having to take tough votes and that suing @entity18 is necessary because he is n't doing his real job of working with @entity2			1
the polarization @entity53 in @entity5 can be very attractive for a member of @entity2 to fall into selling a partisan only message to their constituents			1
but , when @entity14 run into a tv show they do n't like , they turn the channel			2
voters are desperate to know about what can be accomplished to help them			1
climate change is n't going to cut it for @entity19 and abortion is n't going to work for @entity20			2
they simply do n't connect to the average voter concerns			2
the issues that matter are front and center in everyday @entity14 life			2
both sides are going to have to address the border crisis and their solutions to the problem			1
we are dealing with innocent children who are caught up in this mess			2
the news has saturated @entity14 and is a common topic around dinner tables and water coolers across the country			2
people are concerned and frustrated that @entity5 has spent too much time finger - pointing at each other			0
how do our elected officials plan to help create the conditions for more jobs , more money in their wallets and more food on the table ? how can their lives be made better for themselves and their children ? the @entity19 will likely point to some positive economic indicators and rising consumer confidence to show that it is turning around			0
but they lack an overall agenda to demonstrate there is a future method toward achieving economic stability			0
republicans can show they have a plan to turn around the economy faster , but rightfully point out the inaction by the @entity19 to address @entity20 plans			0
the @entity109 , run by @entity20 , has passed myriad bills dealing with job creation , gas prices and small business issues			0
these bills can be used as basis for a forward - looking agenda			0
the battle over the female voter will continue through august , with @entity19 pointing to the @entity119 decision on female contraception coverage as a threat to women 's rights			0
the @entity19 have also tried to push through votes appealing to the middle class on the minimum wage and the gender gap in pay			0
@entity109 @entity20 finally wised up and recently offered a female agenda of their own right before the august break that would increase job training , incentivize flexible work schedules , provide tax breaks for children and families , and strengthens charter schools			0
the package also includes new legislation to prevent retaliation when women ask about equal pay			0
beyond this rhetoric , there is a better opportunity for @entity20 in this election cycle to sell a positive message to voters because democrats are being forced to defend the @entity149 and its handling of the crises at home and abroad			1
it 's more difficult for a @entity154 to have to answer questions about the missing e-mail scandal at the @entity157 or president @entity18 's handling of @entity160 or the @entity161 and then pivot to a positive message on female gender pay			0
and people are mad at @entity5			0
republicans can blame the president for his failure of leadership , but the bulk of their arguments must be centered on positive solutions that connect with people who are tired of the finger pointing			1
this means that @entity14 could lean toward the @entity20 when they vote this november , if the focus is kept on what people are demanding to know , which is , " how we get out of this mess ? " join us on @entity180 / @entity179 .			0

@entity182 : as @entity2 leaves for recess , members face an angry electorate
the approval ratings for @entity2 are at a *dismal* 12.3 %
@entity182 : voters will be looking for solutions , not just spin
