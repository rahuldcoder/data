@entity1 , @entity0 -- they are some of the biggest names in @entity5 , but even @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 have had their fair share of casting calamities they would rather forget			1
@entity12 sabotaged some auditions for parts he did n't want			1
" why not be nude even if it is a children 's theatre ? " @entity2 's @entity17 has managed to persuade the cream of @entity5 to confess their tales of audition woe			1
the stars shudder at the memory of waiting in line , frantically trying to memorize lines handed to them moments before , all the while being assessed by critical strangers			1
@entity27 recounts attending 50 or 60 auditions before getting a part and @entity30 told @entity31 he " blew it " when he first auditioned for " @entity33			1
" while @entity34 remembers a cutting personal assessment : " you 're not pretty enough			1
" here are some of their worst moments : @entity40 " @entity41 : @entity42			2
" " @entity43 " " there was one that started out terrible , which was where i had to go to a disused tax office in @entity51 [ near @entity1 , @entity0 ] very early in the morning and put on very tight velvet flared loon pants and a pair of crocodile four - inch - heeled platform shoes , and wear a sort of very small top that did n't meet my trousers , hair extensions and i had to karaoke to ' @entity61 ' by @entity62			2
it 's a very lonely place			2
and i was 45 at the time ... " @entity7 " before @entity65 , " " @entity64 " " i have had so many bad auditions			1
i have fallen on my ass			1
i have made a complete fool of myself			2
i auditioned for @entity69 once and i was so starstruck i could n't even speak			1
i had a mic wire at a screen test clipped to me and then i got kind of nervous and i paced in a circle and then took a step and tripped and fell on my face			2
you just have to forgive yourself and keep going on			2
" @entity12 " @entity76 : the spy who shagged me , " " @entity79 " " i 've had some bad auditions for some tv movies that were shooting in @entity0 where i just did n't want to be in them and offered them more obtuse [ performances ] ... i like to think of it as performance art. i did n't sabotage it , i was just woefully inappropriate , you know ? i just thought , ' why not be nude even if it is a children 's theatre ? " @entity34 " being @entity91 , " " @entity92 , @entity93 " " you would n't believe some of the comments , assessments			2
but , they 're really not meant personally			2
like for example , ' you 're not pretty enough			2
' for them it 's just a fact			2
but for you it 's like , ' oh my @entity102 ! i have to live with this			0
' you get a thicker skin about it , which you should because it is n't meant personally , but it 's such a personal profession that you kind of have to get used to getting critiqued on things that you should n't even care about			0
" @entity8 " @entity109 , " " meet the @entity110 " " the most famous casting director from @entity93 , i was lucky enough to get an audition with her in the ' 60s			1
she did all the plays , all the @entity113 plays			0
she is sitting across the desk saying her lines , and i am saying mine , and she stops and says , ' come here			0
bring your chair here , right next to me			0
' and i say , ' why ? ' and she says , ' because i ca n't hear you , and you have never been on the stage or on @entity113 , and you are going to have to reach the last row			0
' i said , ' yeah , i know			0
i have been studying acting for about seven years now , but i 'm not on @entity113 now , i 'm just sitting in front of you			0
' so , she said , ' i know , but i could n't hear you			0
that 's why i asked you to sit next to me			0
' i said , ' okay			0
can you hear me now ? ' i was getting so angry			0
well , at that point she said , ' speak up , ' and i screamed as loud as i could , every line after			1
she called my agent and said , ' if you ever send that maniac around here again i will never see another one of your clients			1
' i really lost it			1
@entity31 " @entity138 , " " @entity33 " " i left the casting of ' hostel : @entity141 , ' which @entity30 [ @entity30 ] was a producer on to go and audition for his movie [ ' @entity33 ' ] and it was just a room with a camera			1
he was n't even there and i was like , ' where 's @entity30 ? ' they go ' he did n't leave his house today			0
' anyways , i blew it			1
i did terribly and @entity30 called me and starts making fun of me			0
he was like , ' you were so bad in your audition , but i 'll give you a callback			1
' @entity154 " @entity155 , " " @entity156 : @entity157 " " i auditioned for ' @entity155 ' with @entity158 and @entity159 and when i went into that audition i was eight months pregnant , so there is always kind of a lasting impression that i was playing this military officer with this gigantic belly			1
obviously , it turned out well because i got the role but there was something quite odd about it			0
" @entity169 " @entity170 , " " @entity171 " " i remember auditioning for one play , and the girl was awfully short and we were holding the book in our hands and i almost could n't see her			0
i knew i was n't going to get that part , i tried to make myself smaller and smaller so i could be closer her size and that did n't happen			0
" @entity180 " transformers : @entity181 , " the taking of @entity182 1 2 3 " " i met [ ' transformers ' director ] @entity186 in his office in @entity188 for an hour and a half he had me running , jumping and diving all over his office and his furniture freaking out like i was reacting to robots , which is the strangest audition i have had by far			1
i left the room completely drenched in sweat and all i could say was , ' i better get this part			0
' it worked out and the stuff we did in the room was the stuff we did on set			0
