@entity1 relatives of missing @entity3 passengers wept , begged and cursed a @entity5 diplomat in @entity6 on monday			1
they went to a meeting at a hotel there , expecting a long - awaited briefing from @entity5 technical experts , but erupted in anger when the diplomat announced a change in plans			2
there would be no briefing			2
" we do n't know at this point whether they are alive or dead			2
and you have n't given us any direct proof of where they actually are			2
we want our loved ones back , " a father of a missing passenger cried			1
he 's not the only one waiting for answers			2
in @entity28 , @entity27 smiles , but it 's a brave face she 's putting on			2
her husband @entity30 was a member of the cabin crew on the flight that disappeared more than six weeks ago			1
" emotionally , it 's up and down			2
you know ? sometimes , i 'm ok			2
sometimes , so - so			0
sometimes -- always -- very sad , " she said			0
the couple had been planning to celebrate their 13th anniversary this year			0
they have three children , ages 12 , 10 and 8			0
recalling a conversation she had with her husband before he left , @entity43 said : " i was asking him , ' are we going to have the next 13 years together ? ' of course			0
" their children , she said : " they have faith that their father will be coming back			1
" nothing new but 46 days into the search , that possibility seems less and less likely			1
the underwater drone scanning the ocean for @entity3 was wrapping up its ninth mission tuesday with " no contacts of interest " in its last eight , the @entity57 's @entity56 said			1
the @entity63 has scanned about two thirds of the intended territory without finding any sign of the missing plane			1
these efforts may be a main focus of the search , but they are n't the only part			1
the coordination center announced tuesday morning that up to 10 military aircraft and 10 ships would participate in the day 's search for the @entity76 and the 239 passengers and crew on board			1
later , it said that planned air activities had been suspended because of poor weather conditions triggered by @entity83			1
" it has been determined that the current weather conditions are resulting in heavy seas and poor visibility , and would make any air search activities ineffective and potentially hazardous , " the coordination center said in a statement			1
according to @entity92 spokesman @entity91 , there is " currently a broad discussion among all stakeholders " about how the search operation should proceed in the long run			1
the discussions are " in the early stages " still , he said , but authorities are looking ahead for planning as far out as july			0
few answers for families of the missing passengers , the wait is agonizing -- and infuriating			1
@entity5 's @entity105 says it understands their need for answers , but does n't have many to offer			0
that is perhaps the most frustrating thing for @entity112 , whose cousin and his new wife were on the flight			0
they were on their way to @entity6 for their honeymoon			0
he believes they 're still alive			0
" the sea can not just swallow a plane , " @entity112 said sunday			1
" i believe the plane has been hijacked			1
" it 's a common belief			0
" i believe the government did n't try to hide ... any information from us , " said @entity125			0
" they are telling the truth , but then mostly members of ... the families -- they do not want to believe			0
" that includes his wife			0
" my wife can not accept that			0
she still believes that the plane was hijacked and she believes that my daughter is still alive			1
" his daughter and new son - in - law were another honeymoon couple on the flight			0
the families ' list it was early on march 8 when @entity3 set off from the @entity5 capital of @entity28 , destined for @entity6			1
what happened next has been a confounding mystery , with the frustration of passengers ' family members compounded by a scarcity of details from authorities			0
new bits of information that have come out six weeks later may help round out the picture but do n't answer the main question : why did the plane go off course , and where is it now ? these recent developments include a senior @entity5 aviation source 's assertion that the jetliner deviated from its flight path while inside @entity168 airspace			1
it turned left , then climbed to 39,000 feet -- below its maximum safe limit of 43,100 feet -- and maintained that altitude for about 20 minutes over the @entity173 before beginning to descend , the source said			0
@entity174 has declined to answer @entity176 's questions on various matters -- including the fact that , according to the source , the missing jet was equipped with four emergency locator transmitters			2
when triggered by a crash , @entity182 are designed to transmit their location to a satellite			0
relatives of people aboard the jetliner have drawn up 26 questions -- many of them technical issues -- that they want addressed by @entity5 officials			0
among them : what 's in the flight 's log book ? can they review the jet 's maintenance records ? can they listen to recordings of the @entity76 pilot 's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost ? there 's no word on when families will get the answers they 're looking for			2
