-- with her curved ' wings , ' long pointed nose , and gleaming underbelly propped high above the waves , this space - age yacht might be better suited to the sky than the sea			1
just a few square meters of the futuristic vessel -- valued at $ 15 million -- actually touch the surface of the water , allowing it to skim across the waves with ease			1
the innovative design , along with high - tech features such as an ipad - controller , helped glossy " @entity23 " win three prizes at last week 's prestigious @entity20 in @entity21 , including @entity22			1
the yachting world is clearly impressed			0
the honor follows a prize for the @entity27 at the 2013 @entity28 earlier this year			0
so could this alien shape -- resembling something between a spaceship and the @entity33 supersonic plane -- be the future of superyacht design ? " the superyacht industry is pretty traditional , " designer @entity36 , told @entity0			1
" but the establishment has given a ' yes ' to this idea which is a huge step forward			0
" " inevitably , there has to be a trend for reducing fuel consumption -- and i think superyachts will have to look something like this in the future			1
initially i do n't think economics will drive it -- these are wealthy owners and cost is n't an issue			0
instead , it will be from an ethical , environmental point of view			0
" billionaire 's toys billionaire shipping magnate @entity58 is believed to be the proud owner of the plush 42.5 - meter vessel , which took more than five years to design and build			1
the @entity63 - based mogul and wife @entity64 will be able to remotely control their luxury yacht from up to 50 meters away , simply by sweeping their hand over an @entity69			1
if you want to appeal to the mega rich , such flashy gadgets -- and room to house them -- are now an essential part of superyacht architecture			2
" we have recently seen an increase in new and exciting superyacht toys on the market and clients are increasingly looking for more space to house these , " said co-exterior designer @entity76			2
" our new designs incorporate lots of space to accommodate jet skis , sailing boats , kayaks , paddle boards and other toys			0
" speed machine with just 20 % of the enormous 52 - ton boat submerged in water , @entity92 is able to glide along the waves without the same drag as traditional superyachts , hitting up to 43 kilometers per hour			1
it also means the vessel , made from a super-light glass and carbon material , consumes a lot less fuel -- around 14 % of a conventional superyacht the same size			1
" @entity92 's longer , slender main hull has extremely low drag , which is why she is so fuel efficient , " explained @entity76			0
" the smooth , seamless , unbroken surfaces also help to reduce weight , " he said of the boat , which can travel up to 6,400 kilometers -- the same distance from @entity111 to @entity112 -- without refueling			0
in fact , the three - pronged design -- featuring a slim hull and two ' wings ' -- is similar to the world 's fastest sailboat @entity120 , which broke the speed record in 2009 at 95 kilometers per hour			1
living in luxury step inside the sleek @entity92 and you 'll find all the luxury of a five - star hotel , including five elegant bedrooms and four bathrooms			2
the plush yacht also features a saloon , a lounge and an industrial kitchen			2
the rear deck has an open - air bar , allowing guests to gaze out at the water while they enjoy a cocktail			2
at night , the glowing underbelly of the boat lights up in neon blue , giving it the impression of a futuristic spacecraft			0
if the reams of recent awards are anything to go by , this yachting future could be a lot closer than you think .			0
