-- @entity2 @entity1 senator @entity1 announced last week that he is taking legal action against president @entity4 for " snooping on the @entity2 people			1
" meanwhile , @entity7 senator @entity6 has asked new questions in recent days to the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) about whether it has spied on elected @entity2 officials , including in @entity12			1
these related developments underline that the controversies over the @entity9 have become perhaps the biggest issue in the president 's in - tray following months of damaging revelations , from @entity19 , about @entity2 surveillance programs -- both domestically and internationally			1
with the disclosures doing considerable damage to the reputation of the @entity2 in general , and particular harm to the @entity9 , and individual @entity2 technology firms , the president is keen to try to try to draw a line in the sand in the new year			1
over @entity29 , @entity4 spent much time during his @entity32 vacation reviewing reform options , including the 46 recommended in december by the independent @entity33			1
and , he has promised a " definitive statement " in coming days on reforms to the @entity9			2
the president has already talked positively about some of the independent panel 's recommendations , including halting the @entity9 's collection and storage of millions of @entity2 phone records and instead requiring phone firms to hold this data			1
however , it remains unclear how sweeping the entire package of changes will be , nor how well received they will by @entity2 and international publics			2
while the @entity33 is determined to move off the defensive on this issue , this will not be helped by the continuing flood of publicity that surrounds the @entity9			1
moreover , barring an amnesty for @entity19 from @entity4 , it is also probable that there will be further damaging revelations from the former government contractor that help keep the issue in the spotlight			1
the likelihood of further disclosures is underlined by the estimate that @entity19 has leaked only a small fraction so far of the material about the @entity9 that he has in his possession			2
this highlights one of the fundamental issues underlying the @entity19 affair : what it reveals about the changing map of influence and power in a world that continues to be transformed by economic globalization and the information revolution , including the rise of " big data " enabled by digital technology			0
to date , these forces have generally reinforced @entity2 international pre-eminence for several reasons , including the country 's relative technological edge over much of the rest of the world ( which will decrease over time ) ; the fact that its dominant culture and ideas are very close to prevailing global norms ; and that its multiple channels of communication help to frame global issues			1
however , this emerging environment has simultaneously raised new challenges , and not just for the @entity2			2
for instance , the potential for sensitive leaks , and technological advances that have led to vast increases in open source information for publics , has fueled skepticism of government information and actions			0
indeed , governments increasingly compete for international credibility not just with their foreign counterparts , but also " new " actors such as media outlets like @entity115 , and other organizations like @entity117			0
sensitive disclosures , and / or information that is perceived to be manipulated or propaganda , can undermine the credibility of a country and / or its government			0
in the context of the @entity19 allegations , key dangers for @entity125 are not just potential backlash from international publics			0
but also foreign elites ( even strong allies like those in @entity133 ) proving more cautious in sharing information and cooperation			0
looking specifically at the campaign against terrorism , the @entity19 affair thus intensifies the global diplomacy challenge that @entity4 faces five years into his presidency			2
while the president is still quite popular personally in many countries , international favourability towards the country and @entity2 policies is now generally in reverse			1
for instance , among the 22 countries surveyed by @entity150 in both 2009 ( the first year of @entity4 's presidency ) and 2013 approval of @entity2 international policies has dropped by about 20 % or more in six states , including @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157			1
in many other countries ( including @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , and @entity167 ) , the fall - off is over 10 % over the same period			0
@entity2 use of drone strikes on suspected terrorists , in particular , is widely unpopular internationally			1
more than half of the populations , in almost all countries surveyed by @entity150 in 2013 , were opposed to continued use of these unmanned combat aerial vehicles			0
the public diplomacy challenge facing the @entity2 is particularly grave , right now , in the @entity177 where support for the campaign on terrorism is especially important			2
however , only an alarming 11 % of the population in @entity182 , 14 % in @entity166 , 16 % in @entity157 and the @entity184 territories , and 21 % in @entity165 , currently have favorable views toward the @entity2 according to @entity150			2
it is important that the @entity4 team begins to turn this climate of opinion around			1
this is because , in common with the @entity192 , the challenges posed by the campaign against terrorism simply can not be overcome by military might alone			0
thus , @entity125 must redouble its efforts to win the battle for international " hearts and minds			0
" this will help create an enabling ( rather than disabling ) environment facilitating both covert and overt cooperation and information sharing with @entity2 officials			0
to be sure , some countries will continue to assist @entity125 because of factors such as self interest and / or fundamental agreement with @entity2 strategy and policy			0
however , the degree to which other states do so , especially in crucial theaters like the @entity177 and @entity213 , will often depend heavily upon a mixture of the attractiveness amongst foreign publics , and the degree of trust and support within national elites , of the @entity2 in general and the @entity4 administration in particular			1
it would be a tragedy if these relationships become critically damaged by the @entity19 affair			0
