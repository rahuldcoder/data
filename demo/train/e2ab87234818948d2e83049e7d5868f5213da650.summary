-- the world received word yesterday that the publishers of @entity4 would stop producing hardbound , paper copies of their venerable reference			1
actually , they stopped in 2010 but did n't tell anyone			1
now they 've disclosed they 've been able to sell just 8,000 copies of the collection			2
the rest are in a warehouse in @entity16 , looking for someone who needs historically accurate , out - of - date information			2
according to the company , they 'll continue publishing online and will sell their services to individuals , schools and libraries			0
in some respects , that 's good			1
the @entity28 is much more easily updated , more interactive , and can deliver motion , sound , and color simultaneously			0
in other respects , that 's not good , particularly for young readers , older folks , immigrants , and technophobes who 'd rather read a book			1
britannica 's decision is , in so many ways , simply a mile marker along the way to the new world of the 21st century			1
in mid- 20th century @entity48 , a set of @entity46 on the shelf was a status symbol : a sign that the family had money , taste , some pretense to intellect , or at least a very strong desire to be seen that way			1
other families had the @entity58 , @entity59 , or the @entity60 ( my own family 's choice )			1
annual yearbooks updated entries in science , technology , industrial manufacturing , botany , and more			0
and , for so many of us who grew up in the 20th century , it was fun just to look through those volumes , read , and wonder about the world			0
@entity75 has largely replaced those printed volumes , principally because it 's free			1
everything on the @entity28 is free ( or should be , according to its most passionate users )			0
the fact that it 's not written , edited , or monitored by content matter experts seems to be of little concern			1
crowd - sourcing has replaced experts and , though not good , the accuracy quotient of @entity75 articles seems to be improving			1
this is , however , part of a trend that assumes expertise is overvalued			0
today , most technology users value connectivity and experience			0
newspapers and magazines are in decline , bloggers and content aggregators are on the ascendant			0
the problem with crowd - sourcing the answer to any particular question is , of course , that you 're as likely to find ideologically driven opinion as hard fact			0
you also have little in the way of support for judgments about credibility , reliability , and accuracy			1
ours is a society that can not afford to do without a postal service , daily newspapers , and expertly edited sources of public knowledge			0
the notion that all knowledge is available online within six clicks is both exciting and a bit frightening ( have you googled yourself , your friends , or your children to see what 's online , including images ? )			2
the disappearance of our printed sources of information poses two serious concerns			0
first , our antiquated , overtaxed , patchwork power grid is perennially on the verge of collapse			0
@entity134 hackers , aging components , or an @entity137 tornado could take down large segments of our power supply			0
no power , no internet			0
second , just two - thirds of all @entity48 have access to the internet at work or home			1
those of us who live with an @entity150 , @entity149 , tablet device ( or a desktop computer ) seem to think just about everyone is connected			2
online access is far from a given for lower - income people			0
wireless handheld devices and municipal @entity157 systems look promising , but more than 100 million @entity48 are not connected to the @entity144 , according to the @entity159 's internet and @entity160			1
clearly this is a hinge point in history , much like @entity164 's use of moveable type to operate a printing press , or @entity168 's use of wireless communication to transmit the human voice over vast distances			2
the arrival of video scanning -- which made digital optics possible -- and high - speed data processing have accelerated the rate of change and we 're simply going to have to live with it and make the best of it			2
in the interim , we could think about buying a book or subscribing to a newspaper ( just for old time 's sake ) , or we could do something important for that one - third of our neighbors that will serve as an information safety net : support your local public library			2
they , too , offer access to the @entity144 , but they also offer a clean , safe , nicely organized source for each of us to find information that 's useful , valuable , interesting , and helpful			1
looking forward to the world our children and their children will live in does n't mean simply abandoning technology that seems anachronistic			2
it means preserving the best of what we know and making it accessible to everyone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 , @entity214			1

@entity4 *announced* that it wo n't print more books
@entity218 says as much as we gain from the @entity144 , there are also losses
@entity4 's accuracy and availability made it a valuable *resource* , he says
@entity213 : a third of @entity48 are n't connected to the web
