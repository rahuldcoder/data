-- an @entity2 report issued wednesday blasts @entity3 for its handling of the hundreds of oil spills that occur each year in @entity6 and accuses the company of " serious deficiencies and abuses " that render " wholly unreliable " its claims about how much oil is spilled and how often			1
the 80 - page report , titled " @entity14 -- oil spills in the @entity22 , " cites corrosion , poor maintenance , equipment failure , sabotage and oil theft as causes of oil spills			1
but it challenges the company 's assertion that the vast majority of the spills are caused by sabotage and theft			1
" there is no legitimate basis for this claim , " the report says			0
" it relies on the outcome of an oil spill investigation process -- commonly known as the @entity38 or @entity39 process -- in which the companies themselves are the primary investigators			0
" reliable data about the spills is critical to limiting the harm they can cause to the environment , livelihoods and human health , the report says			2
determining their cause is critical because communities affected by spills blamed on sabotage or theft get no compensation in @entity6 , which is itself a flaw , the report says			1
" oil companies should be held responsible for a spill that is due to sabotage or theft if the operator has failed to take sufficient measures to prevent tampering with its infrastructure , " it says			2
in response , @entity3 -- in a statement sent to @entity0 by spokesman @entity67 -- said : " the @entity69 of @entity6 ( @entity69 ) firmly rejects unsubstantiated assertions that they have exaggerated the impact of crude oil theft and sabotage to distract attention from operational performance			1
" we seek to bring greater transparency and independent oversight to the issue of oil spills , and will continue to find ways to enhance this			0
these efforts include publishing spill data online since january 2011 and working with @entity83 , an independent third party , to find ways to improve the immediate response to a spill			0
" the @entity2 report acknowledges improvements since 2011 , but says " serious flaws remain " in the company 's oil spill investigation process			1
" these include weaknesses in the underlying evidence used to attribute spills to sabotage and the fact that the @entity39 reports are filled out by @entity3 after the joint investigation process -- not as part of the joint investigation process			1
there is , consequently , a lack of transparency and oversight in terms of what is recorded on the new @entity39 reports			0
" but @entity3 said in its statement that @entity69 can not control the joint investigation process , since it involves representatives of regulatory bodies , the @entity113 , the @entity114 , the state government and affected communities			2
the company cited a recent report from @entity119 's @entity118 that said an average of 100,000 barrels of oil were stolen each day in the first quarter of this year			2
" coordinated action from the industry , government , security forces , civil society and others is needed to end this criminality , which remains the main cause of oil pollution in the @entity134 today , " it said			0
" @entity69 regrets that some @entity135 continue to take a campaigning approach rather than focusing on on - the - ground solutions that bring societal benefits			0
" @entity139 , director of global issues for @entity2 in @entity141 , rejected the company 's characterization of the report 's claims as " unsubstantiated			1
" " the assertions are very well substantiated in the report , " she said in a telephone interview			2
" we 've taken the process down step by step , with expert advice , and provided individual cases , and all of this was provided to @entity3 beforehand to seek responses , and we got no responses to anything			1
" she also disputed the company 's description of @entity83 as independent			0
" @entity83 is hired by @entity3 , " she said			2
and she said the @entity118 report is irrelevant			0
" yes , it documents significant theft , " which is a serious issue , she said			0
but , she added , " theft is not oil spills			0
proving there 's loads of theft does n't prove there 's lots of oil spills due to the theft			1
