-- the most important decision @entity2 has made in his campaign so far , the selection of @entity6 rep. @entity5 for his running mate , tells us two things -- and neither bears good news for the middle class			1
first , @entity2 has fully and unequivocally embraced the extreme @entity5 budget plan			1
earlier this year , he called it " marvelous " -- now he 's made it his own			0
the @entity2 - @entity5 plan would throw seniors under the bus and undermine their health security by ending @entity19 as we know it			1
it would increase health care costs for seniors , including those on fixed income , by thousands of dollars a year			0
the extreme plan proposed by this year 's @entity27 ticket would bring huge tax breaks to millionaires , paid for by tax hikes on the middle class , and massive cuts to investments that strengthen the middle class -- priorities like education , health care , energy and scientific and medical research			1
whether you are a college student trying to pay for school , a veteran worried about your health benefits , or a senior worried about retirement security , the @entity41 plan is bad news			1
it would have devastating real - world effects on people young and old across the country			0
by the numbers : @entity5 @entity2 and @entity5 have put ideology ahead of what 's right			2
they refuse to increase taxes on the wealthiest @entity57 under any circumstance -- not another dime , ever			0
unlike the @entity62 deficit reduction plan or the president 's balanced plan to reduce the deficit that include asking everyone to pay their fair share , the @entity41 budget would reduce the deficit on the backs of seniors and the middle class			1
even the @entity57 @entity73 admonished the @entity41 plan			0
so did a group of nuns who recently traveled by bus across the country with the message that our budget is not just our country 's fiscal map , it is our moral one			0
they rightly pointed out that , as it says in @entity93 , " if one part suffers , every part suffers with it , if one part is honored , every part rejoices with it			0
" on the political front , @entity5 's selection is yet another sign that @entity2 is running to the far right and is the most extreme conservative candidate we have had in generations			1
the embrace of an ideologue like @entity5 may appeal to the @entity27 's @entity102 base , but it will completely alienate independent voters , especially in battleground states			2
opinion : @entity5 and gen @entity106 seniors in @entity109 and @entity110 have every reason to worry what a @entity2 - @entity5 administration would do to them when @entity19 is handed over to private insurance companies and @entity115 is subject to the whims of @entity117			2
voters should also consider that , even as our nation faces threats of terrorism and remains at war , for the first time in modern presidential history the @entity27 ticket lacks any national security credentials			2
it 's no coincidence , then , that its views on national security are dangerous and ill - considered			1
any voter wondering about our leaders ' values should consider what they do in the room when the tough decisions are on the table			0
while president @entity141 was in the @entity142 , making the toughest calls any president has had to make -- how to save the economy from depression , rescue the @entity57 auto industry , bring affordable health care to millions of @entity57 or take out @entity149 -- @entity5 was in a different room			0
how @entity2 campaign kept @entity5 tap under wraps he was sitting side - by - side with fellow @entity155 @entity27 ideologues @entity156 and @entity157 as they risked the full faith and credit of the @entity57 , regardless of what it would mean for the middle class , jobs and women 's rights			1
if there ever was a question about what this election is about , today 's announcement answers it			0
throughout this campaign , @entity2 has lacked a clear vision			2
now he 's embraced a radical ideologue with a dangerous one			2
this election is absolutely a choice between two visions for our country 's future			0
@entity2 and @entity5 have solidified their roles as rubber stamps for the reckless and failed economic theories of the past			1
watch @entity0 tonight at 7 and 10 et for an in - depth look at @entity5 and the next steps for @entity2 's presidential campaign			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

@entity191 : @entity2 's pick of @entity5 running mate an embrace of @entity5 's radical budget plan
she says it 's bad news for middle class ; plan would hurt seniors , poor , help rich on taxes
she says even @entity206 *object* to cuts ; ticket 's lack of national security experience dangerous
@entity191 : @entity2 has shown his vision continues reckless , failed economic theories of the past
