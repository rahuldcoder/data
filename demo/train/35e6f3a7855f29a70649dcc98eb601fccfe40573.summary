way out beyond @entity1 , but before you get to @entity3 , is a planet			2
there 's a planet between @entity1 and @entity3			2
you may not have heard of it , but it was discovered in 1801 -- 129 years before @entity10			0
it originally was called a planet , then later an asteroid and now it 's called a dwarf planet			0
its name is @entity17 ( pronounced like series ) and you 'll likely be hearing a lot more about it in the coming weeks			1
@entity17 is one of five named dwarf planets recognized by @entity23 and the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			1
the other four are @entity25 , @entity10 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
but @entity17 is the first of these worlds to get a visitor from @entity31 : @entity23 's @entity32 is arriving on march 6			1
" @entity17 is a ' planet ' that you 've probably never heard of , " said @entity33 , @entity32 project manager at @entity23 's @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
@entity17 may be considered a dwarf planet , but it 's " the giant of the main asteroid belt , " dr. @entity39 , chief engineer and mission director of the @entity32 , told @entity0			1
" it is not only the largest object between @entity1 and @entity3 , it is the largest object between the sun and @entity10 that a spacecraft has not yet visited			2
" " we are tremendously excited , " @entity39 said			0
" we have guided this robotic probe for well over seven years on an interplanetary journey of more than 3 billion miles			0
along the way we sailed past @entity1			0
we spent 14 months orbiting and scrutinizing the giant protoplanet @entity54			0
... now , finally , we are on the verge of conducting the first exploration ever of the first dwarf planet			0
" images taken on february 19 when @entity32 was about 29,000 miles ( 46,000 kilometers ) from @entity17 show a bright spot on @entity17 and a dimmer companion amid the small world 's cratered surface			1
@entity23 says both spots appear to be in the same basin			1
the images are puzzling to scientists and they say they 'll have to wait until @entity32 gets even closer to sort out the cause			2
" we we will have to wait for better resolution before we can make such geologic interpretations , " said @entity68 , principal investigator for the @entity32 , based at the @entity69 , @entity70			0
@entity39 said @entity17 ' surface is pretty beaten up and that its craters are " scars from life in the rough and tumble asteroid belt			1
" why study a beaten - up space rock ? @entity39 said because it 's a survivor -- and a mysterious one			2
made up of rock and ice , @entity17 may even have liquid water deep beneath its surface -- " perhaps as ponds or lakes or even oceans , " @entity39 said			1
he said @entity17 " appears to have been in the process of growing to become a full - sized planet when @entity3 terminated its growth nearly 4.6 billion years ago			1
" so by studying @entity17 , scientists learn more about how the rest of the solar system formed			1
and he said , we should study @entity17 because it 's there -- and we need to understand the universe we live in			1
" we should study it because we hunger for knowledge and understanding			0
grand undertakings like this nurture our spirit , " @entity39 said			0
@entity39 said that if you had learned about the solar system 200 years ago , " you would have learned that @entity17 was a planet , just as people who learned about the solar system in more recent generations learned that @entity10 is			1
" speaking of @entity10 , the most famous of the dwarf planets gets its own visitor in july			0
the @entity113 spacecraft is closing in for a flyby of @entity10 and its moons			1
this talk of planets and dwarf planets is still a little confusing , so here 's the most recent tally : @entity23 currently recognizes eight planets : @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity31 , @entity1 , @entity3 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , and the five named dwarf planets we listed earlier			1
but a sixth possible dwarf planet already is on @entity23 's watch list			1
called 2012 @entity132 , it 's believed to be one of the most distant objects in our solar system			0
on its @entity137 website , @entity23 says the object was nicknamed " @entity141 " after vice president @entity142 because of the vp in its initial designation			2
it will be up to the @entity24 to decide whether i2012 @entity132 is a dwarf planet and whether it gets an official name			0
but expect the numbers for planets in our solar system to keep changing			0
@entity149 , the @entity150 astronomy professor who helped discover dwarf planet @entity25 and who takes responsibility for killing off @entity10 as a full - fledged planet , has his own tally listing more than 360 possible dwarf planets			0
and @entity23 has said there may be many more dwarf planets that we have n't found yet			2
so @entity17 , and its cousins , may soon outnumber the traditional planets you learned about in grade school .			2
