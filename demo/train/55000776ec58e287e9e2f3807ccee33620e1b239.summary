-- first the good news : @entity3 's $ 5 million found footage horror sequel " @entity2 " easily led the box office with $ 30.2 million in its first three days			1
now for the bad news : that 's 43 percent less ( i.e. $ 22.4 million less ) than " @entity7 " earned in its debut frame , and 26 percent less ( $ 10.5 million ) than " @entity9 " managed			1
fortunately for @entity3 , the tiny cost of the @entity12 films still make them highly profitable , but the sharp drop off from " @entity15 " to " @entity18 " could spell trouble for the franchise			0
" @entity2 , " which received a " c " @entity25 grade from polled audiences , has received the worst reviews of any entry in the series , yet @entity3 chose to open it earlier than its predecessors			1
the film was released on thursday night at 9 p.m. — " @entity30 " and " @entity15 " opened at midnight — and perhaps negative word - of - mouth spread faster and earlier , thus limiting its weekend prospects			1
also making matters difficult was direct competition from @entity34 , the similarly themed horror title that opened to $ 18 million last weekend			0
one thing is certain : " @entity2 " is going to have a front - loaded run			1
the picture fell by a whopping 38 percent from friday ( $ 15.1 million ) to saturday ( $ 9.4 million ) — never a sign of box office longevity			1
furthermore , horror movies — and especially horror sequels — are typically some of the most front - loaded films of any genre due to young audiences ( 60 percent of @entity18 's audience was below the age of 25 ) , who rush to the theater on opening weekend			1
" @entity30 " and " @entity15 " each finished with about twice as much as they earned on opening weekend , grossing $ 84.8 and $ 104 million respectively , but " @entity18 " will be lucky to score $ 60 million total			2
still , this is n't a shameful result — the film only cost $ 5 million , and its $ 8,851 per theater average was the best in the @entity56 — but it 's certainly an underwhelming one			2
if " @entity2 's " box office take felt less than impressive , " @entity59 's " sophomore frame seemed just the opposite			1
@entity64 ' $ 45 million @entity63 - directed spy thriller dropped only 15 percent in its second weekend to $ 16.6 million , thereby lifting its total to $ 43.2 million after 10 days			1
the @entity67 front - runner , which earned an amazing " a + " cinemascore grade last weekend , has a decent shot at breaking $ 100 million at the domestic box office if it can keep scoring remarkable holds like this one			1
third place went to " @entity73 , " which is demonstrating impressive staying power as @entity75 approaches			0
@entity77 's $ 85 million kiddie flick dropped 22 percent this weekend to $ 13.5 million , giving the film a terrific $ 119 million total			2
in just a few days , " hotel " will become the young @entity81 's most successful film ever domestically , surpassing " @entity82 ' " $ 124.9 million gross			2
in fourth , " taken 2 " dropped by 39 percent ( a better hold than last weekend 's 56 percent decline ) to $ 13.4 million			2
after 17 days , @entity89 's @entity88 vehicle has grossed an impressive $ 106 million , and although it appears likely that @entity90 will fall a bit short of the $ 145 million domestic finish that the original " taken " earned domestically , @entity89 certainly is n't worried			2
the studio spent just $ 45 million on the film , and it is a hit around the world — it took two weeks to outgross its predecessor overseas and has now grossed $ 240.9 million globally — and talks have reportedly already begun for " taken 3			0
" @entity102 's @entity101 fared badly in fifth place			0
the thriller , which stars the oft - cross - dressing madea - director @entity105 in the title role , grossed $ 11.8 million , the worst debut ever for a film starring @entity105 and the worst debut ever in the @entity101 series			1
@entity111 formerly played the action star , based on a popular character in @entity115 's series of novels , in 1997 ′ s " @entity117 " and 2001 ′ s " @entity118 , " which opened with $ 13.2 million and $ 16.7 million , respectively			0
@entity101 , which cost @entity102 and @entity121 about $ 23 million to make , played to a typical @entity105 crowd			0
audiences were 60 percent female , 68 percent above the age of 35 , and 74 percent @entity125 , and although relatively few people saw the film , those that did liked what they saw , issuing it an " a " @entity25 grade			2
maybe if the film had been called @entity105 's @entity101 , it could have started a bit better			0
paranormal activity 4 -- $ 30.2 million 2			0
@entity59 -- $ 16.6 million 3			2
@entity73 -- $ 13.5 million 4			0
taken 2 -- $ 13.4 million 5			0
@entity101 -- $ 11.8 million two more box office shout - outs			1
" @entity137 " has quietly grown into a solid mid-level hit			0
after four weekends , the @entity139 sci - fi thriller has earned $ 57.8 million and it will pass $ 60 million this week			1
meanwhile , @entity67 contender " @entity146 " opened successfully in limited release in @entity141 and @entity142 this weekend , taking in $ 121,000 from four theaters , giving it an impressive $ 30,250 per theater average			0
the film will add nine theaters to its run next weekend			0
