" the novel , designed as a memory album , takes @entity5 from girlhood in small - town @entity31 -- cue family photos , magazine biscuit recipes , freckle - cream ads , and an untoward relationship with an older man -- on to graduation from @entity37 in 1924			2
from there , the aspiring writer goes forth into @entity41 bohemia and expat adventures in @entity43 , including an illicit love affair , progressive political associations , flowering feminism , and encounters with famous folk like @entity49 and @entity50			0

" born of a fling between a married man and @entity99 , a much - younger @entity101 au pair , baby @entity84 is left on a stranger 's doorstep and soon adopted into a loving family			1
@entity84 grows up handsome , intellectually gifted , and powered by a relentless self - confidence			1
the narrative runs briskly through decades and multiple points of view as @entity85 carves a wry edge into @entity111 's tragedy about an abandoned baby who grows up to kill his father and marry his mother			1
for 27 years , @entity99 's and @entity84 's lives run on parallel tracks : she continually reinventing herselfâ € ” working as a high - end call girl , dog walker , and , eventually , life coach -- and he graduating @entity121 and beginning his conquest of the digital world			1
when they meet by chance , the attraction is immediate and the implications horrifyingly obvious , though not to the lustily oblivious couple			0
@entity85 acknowledges that readers will be " shuddering at the prospect " of these two having sex , but it 's worth pushing past the ick factor			1

but as the preacher 's fortunes rose , so , too , did his paranoia and greed ; at one point , having fathered three children with @entity155 and at least one with another woman , he fell afoul of the @entity182 and was sentenced to a stint in jail			0
yet for all the disaster that seems inevitable from the opening pages of this plainspoken memoir , @entity154 still maintains some affection for the part - time charlatan who was often caring and loving to her , as well as an unwitting civil rights activist			2
( he faced down the @entity194 , insisting his congregation stay integrated			0
) it is not until long after @entity154 has lost touch with @entity158 that she can begin to understand he was both prophet and liar			0
