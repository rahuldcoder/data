-- the rescue of 33 trapped men in @entity3 brings home vividly the hazards of mining			1
how do we defend this very blue - collar occupation , which claimed the life of my grandfather , some of his friends and almost killed me , when i was actually pinned between a rock and a hard place ? thousands of hard - working folks are killed and injured in mines worldwide each year			1
this eons - old industry is disparaged by many , but most of the people with close ties to it laud and defend the profession			1
the truth is this : mining is hazardous but essential to the lives we want			1
it 's an activity that produces wealth , provides raw materials for a myriad of products , lifts people out of poverty , develops economies and yes -- kills , maims and disables some of those who work at mining			1
miners , from the child coal miners of old who worked to remove " boney " from the breakers or carried water to the mining executives of today , should be thanked and appreciated for their contribution to civilization			1
let 's reconsider labeling mine operators as the exploiters of earth and humans			1
let us at least acknowledge their entrepreneurial spirit , courage and willingness to get into a business that is difficult by any standard			1
my father was a coal operator			1
but let 's also be fair			0
some operators still are sympathetic to the doctrines of " assumption of risk " or " implied negligence , " so often cited in days gone by as a management defense against the liability of accident loss			2
those who do n't study industrial health and safety or have n't worked in heavy industries such as mining often ask how catastrophes -- such as the april 2010 mine explosion in @entity80 at @entity83 's @entity82 mine or the roof collapse at the @entity86 copper mine in @entity3 -- can happen			1
mining exposes workers to lethal amounts of energy			2
the energies in underground mines are in states of motion or stored in moving shafts and gears ; electricity ; the mine roof , rib or sides of the tunnel ; hydraulic cylinders ; and more			2
an unexpected release of this energy can equal disaster			0
these energies must be controlled at all times and in all situations			0
unfortunately , our controls are not always up to the task			0
the @entity111 event apparently involved the methane gas accumulating into the explosive range and an ignition source			0
mine roofs collapse for many reasons , such as fault lines in the strata , inadequate bolting or other mechanical controls , inadequate pillar size or improper mining methods			1
mines blow up when methane gas accumulations go undetected or inundate a mine quickly before power can be cut or the area can be ventilated			2
investigations into these recent mining disasters have not been completed , so the basic or root causes can not be known yet			2
to prevent incidents in mining , both large and small , is no easy task			2
we are fighting a legion of hazards			0
in underground mines , stored energy in the form of earth surrounds the worker			0
miners work in a confined space that has the potential to collapse on them at any time , despite efforts to maintain the integrity of the roof , ribs and floor of the void in which they work			2
the challenge to identify and control hazards in this workplace is unequaled			0
mine safety begins with commitment			1
management must commit to preventing accidents by providing adequate resources for the identification and control of hazards			2
all mines must integrate safety into everything they do			0
there is no magic bullet to prevent injuries and loss			0
but it 's essential to have commitment : -- to prevention , vigilance and excellence in workplace examinations			0
-- to safe work practices and procedures			0
-- to controlling the hazards associated with the worker , the equipment , material and the environment			0
this takes dedication , a conscientious work force and some good fortune			0
a former supervisor of mine was fond of saying , " plan for the exception , and expect it to happen			0
" perhaps for mining , this goes double			0
the miners who perished at @entity82 were killed instantly			1
there was no opportunity for them to evacuate or take refuge			0
the miners at the @entity86 copper mine might have escaped back in august had all escape routes been maintained properly			1
companies must embrace an aggressive culture of safety prevention first and foremost and also incorporate a program of mine emergency response that is second to none			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

former coal miner @entity213 had close call with death ; grandfather killed in mine
people with close ties to mining laud and defend it , the safety expert says
mining produces wealth , raw materials , lifts people out of poverty , he says
safety very difficult , he writes ; miners need management to be fully committed
