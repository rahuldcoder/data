when @entity1 was a newbie president , there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead			1
government should be seen as a force for good , not evil			1
sure , he told us , it needed to be " smarter and better , " but that could — and would — happen under his watch			2
never mind that @entity15 spent years " reinventing government " with mixed success			2
or that only 2 % of the @entity19 public believes that government can be trusted to do the right thing all the time			2
president @entity1 was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for @entity19 — such as health care reform — and the public would be grateful			1
instead , the president is living his own version of " @entity30 " : staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency			1
the government he has studiously tried to grow , manage and change has become his own personal nemesis			2
all of which makes you wonder : does the president himself trust government anymore ? the scandal at the @entity41 is just the latest in a slew of bureaucratic messes that strike at the core power point of the @entity1 presidency : making government work			1
consider the disastrous health care website rollout			1
even the question of @entity52 surveillance raises questions about the role of government : did the civil libertarian @entity1 allow spies to run amok ? the president is clearly having a running debate with himself over all this			1
about a year ago , after the @entity52 program was revealed and @entity62 and libertarians started squawking , @entity1 seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying			1
" if people ca n't trust not only the executive branch but also do n't trust @entity68 ... to make sure that we 're abiding by the @entity70 ... " he said , " then we 're going to have some problems here			0
these are not trivial matters			0
health care is the signature legislative achievement of the administration , and a botched rollout made it smell bad at the start			1
fixing the @entity79 — and aiding veterans — is a cornerstone of the @entity1 presidency			1
and yet , it all looks as if somehow the bureaucracy has beaten the boss			2
it 's a management issue			2
so far as i can tell , the governing style of this administration has two extremes : issues singled out for micromanagement ( as in , foreign policy , from the @entity94 ) and issues completely delegated ( as in , @entity79 management )			1
what seems to be missing is the in - between : the continual monitoring and early warning system that avoids presidential blindsiding			0
that 's the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done			1
and it can get done			0
the apparatus to do the nation 's business in a competent way is there			2
use it , and manage it			0
that 's what chief executives are hired to do			2
government is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame , sure			0
but if your presidency is based , in large part , on telling @entity19 that government can work for them -- which it can -- you need to make it work			0
it 's not that the president is a hopeless manager			1
he does very well when he leads a hierarchical organization with a single goal , like a presidential bid			0
he 's top dog , he 's not negotiating with anybody , and he 's not trying to get people to do things they do n't want to do			0
in a campaign , for instance , they all want to elect the same person : him			0
but when you have to negotiate — or lead — people not related to you , or not indebted to you or who do n't agree with you , it 's a different story			0
managing or negotiating with people with mixed motives ( @entity68 , anyone ? ) is not an @entity1 strong point			1
by nature , bureaucracies are hard to trust and even harder to tame			0
and if a chief executive is n't careful , it 's an energy - sapping ( and legacy endangering ) vortex that sucks you right in			0
just ask @entity1 , who was government 's best friend			1
does he still feel that way today ? hard to know			0
but my guess is he 's a bit like @entity155			0
" i ca n't go back to yesterday , " she said , " because i was a different person then			0
" opinion : @entity1 is responsible for @entity79 mess , but it may not be entirely his fault			1

@entity1 's plan was for a " smarter and better " government with *demonstrable* *benefits*
@entity166 says president is instead staring down rabbit hole of government *incompetence*
she says the @entity79 scandal , after the health care website woes , *highlights* the problem
@entity166 : @entity1 can be effective in managing but needs to grab control of bureaucracy
