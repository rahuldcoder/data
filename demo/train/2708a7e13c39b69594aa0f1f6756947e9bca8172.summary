@entity0 -- the @entity2 confirmed wednesday that it did an abrupt about - face on guidance allowing same - sex marriages on military bases after receiving a flood of criticism from @entity9 , as well as discussions with @entity12 lawyers			1
the guidance -- outlined in a memorandum last month from the @entity2 chief of chaplains , rear adm. @entity15 -- would have eased the way for same - sex marriage ceremonies once the @entity12 scraps its present " @entity20 " policy			1
" @entity20 , " which bars gays and lesbians from serving openly in the armed forces , is expected to be officially lifted later this year			2
@entity15 said tuesday that his memo , originally issued on april 13 , was suspended " until further notice pending additional legal and policy review and @entity27 coordination			2
" @entity15 's plan gave a green light to the use of base facilities for same - sex ceremonies in states that allow either same - sex marriage or civil unions			1
it said chaplains ' participation in such ceremonies would depend on whether it was " consistent with the tenets of his or her religious " beliefs			0
some critics of the plan warned it would violate the federal @entity47			0
" there was some attention on @entity52 , " @entity12 spokesman col. @entity48 told reporters wednesday morning			2
" that raised the issue so that the ( @entity12 ) legal counsel then again took a look ( and ) determined it needed further review			2
" the @entity2 's surprise switch energized both supporters and opponents of " @entity20			1
" one prominent defender of the law -- @entity64 , head of the @entity65 -- said the controversy should push @entity67 to intervene quickly			0
" @entity67 should not be misled by the @entity2 's equivocation , " @entity64 said			2
" this weather - vane policy is likely to change back as soon as all the branches of service get on board and @entity67 looks the other way			0
" @entity67 must intervene since the @entity12 lawyers do n't know -- or do n't want to tell -- what they are doing , " she said			0
on the other side of the issue , @entity78 executive director @entity77 insisted the @entity2 was within its rights on same - sex marriage policy			1
@entity77 said the @entity12 should not be distracted by " pressure from reactionaries			0
" " at a time when the economy still needs attention , @entity86 was just killed , and revolution and conflict continue to rage across a fragile @entity92 , having policy makers spend valuable and limited time on whether a few gay couples may or may not use a @entity2 facility for a private ceremony at some point in the future is just plain silly , " @entity77 said in a statement sent to @entity1			1
" the @entity2 was right in their analysis last month that nothing stands in the way of operating facilities without discrimination , and further review will no doubt validate that position , " said @entity100 , a spokesman for the @entity101 , which supports same - sex marriage			1
" while some lawmakers are dragging out scare tactics , there is nothing controversial in allowing facilities to be operated in a nondiscriminatory manner , " he said			1
it remains unclear what same - sex marriage policies the other services might be considering or ultimately adopt. as for " @entity20 , " top @entity12 officials have indicated they expect to be ready to implement a repeal of the policy by midsummer			1
@entity124 -- the @entity12 under secretary tasked with overseeing the repeal -- told members of a @entity129 subcommittee in april that the process will not be rushed " because we want to make sure that it 's done right			0
" but " at the same time , we do n't want to take forever to do it , " he said			0
president @entity134 , defense secretary @entity135 and @entity137 chairman adm. @entity136 will ultimately need to certify that the @entity12 is ready for a repeal of the policy			1
at that point , a 60 - day countdown will begin before the repeal is officially implemented			0
@entity1 's @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity12 confirms the @entity2 plan was reversed after criticism from @entity9
new : supporters of same - sex marriage say military facilities should be used in a " nondiscriminatory " manner
the @entity2 has suspended guidance that would have eventually allowed same - sex marriages on military bases
before the " @entity20 " policy is changed , it must receive a final sign - off from top @entity12 officials
