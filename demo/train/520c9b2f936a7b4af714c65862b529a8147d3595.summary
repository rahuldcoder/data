@entity1 , @entity0 -- global warming and the state of the planet are n't exactly laughing matters , but for comedian @entity8 , the dire environmental outlook has at least one bright side			1
@entity8 sees the funny side of global warming at the @entity11			1
" in 50 years , my generation will be in its 70s and we 'll be able to boast that we were the only generation to have contraception , ipods , cheap flights and an ozone layer			2
" if the @entity21 's current predictions are correct and we have only 100 months to come up with a solution to reverse the most catastrophic impacts of climate change , then @entity8 wo n't even reach 40 before he can begin to exalt the ' benefits ' of being a gen - yer			1
in the meantime , he 's using climate change and terrorism as material for his latest comedy offering at the @entity11 in @entity32 , " @entity33			1
" @entity8 told @entity2 it 's the over reaction to terrorism and comparative under reaction to global warming that has his central character -- a @entity42 environmentalist -- on a mission to join @entity44 in an effort to reduce global carbon emissions			1
" the longer we do nothing , the more radical the action we will ultimately have to take			2
the most extreme strategy would be to start killing the world 's worst polluters -- westerners -- preferably in a way which discourages others from flying , " he said			0
and so begins the eco-friendly jihad			0
having grown up in a country plagued by domestic terrorism for three decades , the @entity59 comic insists he is staunchly anti-terrorism , but he told @entity2 he was ready to go where no one else will			0
" it 's much more fun to tell jokes about religious nuts and neo-cons , but the whole point of any political joke is to reveal an ' inconvenient truth			1
' " climate change is the biggest crisis in the history of the world and for a political humorist it 's not inherently funny , but it 's something that no one wants to talk about			2
" @entity77 said as much in her review of the show for " @entity80 " : " @entity8 has a gift for winning an audience over , and coaxing original , friendly humour from subjects that are neither friendly nor funny			1
" she adds : " he 's done his homework , and there are plenty of facts here , but the underlying message is a bleak one : as long as we continue being middle - class consumers , it ai n't looking good for the human race			0
" on debut in 2006 , @entity8 took the @entity11 by storm with " @entity96 : the @entity97 " , which he then toured for 18 months			1
having had the success that comes with five - star reviews and a run of sold out performances , he seems a little underwhelmed by the response to " @entity33			1
" rather than pan the show as extremist , one reviewer thought he did n't go far enough : " he should hold back less and plunge the knife in further			2
not only does @entity8 get better laughs when he 's being more controversial , he also makes you think more			1
" but @entity8 counters saying that he would n't go as far as to actually advocate people join @entity44 to save the planet			1
after all , this is comedy			0
" i did n't personally design climate change and i probably ca n't solve it in an hour , " he jokes			0
so what then does he want his audience to walk away thinking ? " i guess i want people to start out by being honest			0
to say ' okay , we are destroying the planet and we are either okay or not okay with that '			0
people will have to make a decision as to whether or not to then change their behavior			0
" @entity8 says until now he 's adopted the ' every little bit counts ' approach to climate change abatement , but concedes it 's not enough			2
" buy some locally - produced potatoes , a few energy - saving light bulbs , put them all in a re-usable plastic bag and do n't think twice about your weekend break in @entity132			0
" on a serious note , he adds : " people are causing the ultimate destruction of the environment and essentially our fate is in our hands			0
" and that 's no laughing matter .			0
