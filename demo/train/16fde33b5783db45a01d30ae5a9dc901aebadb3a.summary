-- internet and cell phone coverage were restored saturday to most @entity4 provinces , according to the opposition @entity5 , two days after a blackout shut down virtually all internet service in the country			1
residents in the capital , @entity11 , told @entity0 via @entity12 that their @entity2 and cell phone services were working again			0
@entity4 's @entity2 and phone systems blacked out thursday			2
a @entity4 government information minister said friday that " terrorists " -- which is how the @entity22 regime refers to rebels in a bloody , ongoing civil war -- cut the cable , knocking out web communication with other countries			1
" all the internet connections and communications lines are back to work in @entity11 and its suburbs , after the technicians teams managed to fix the malfunction that led to the outage for two days , " an anchor on state - run tv said saturday			1
the network reported there was a malfunction in the main grid in the suburbs of @entity11			1
rebels have routinely used the @entity40 to transmit images of the civil war , including what they claim have been military attacks by the @entity22 regime on civilians			2
however , a leading web security firm said the outage was almost certainly the work of the @entity4 government			1
@entity50 , ceo of @entity51 , said his firm 's investigations showed that all four internet cables linking @entity4 to the outside world would have had to been cut simultaneously for a whole country outage to occur			1
the blackout forced fighters to rely on radio communication , which they say is easier for the @entity4 government to tap			2
the @entity61 @entity60 in @entity11 and expat opposition supporters urged people to use " speak to @entity69 , " a service which allows users to leave an audio message which is tweeted out as a link for people to click on and play			2
however , the phone service outage likely made it difficult to use			2
as a result of the internet shutdown , the flood of daily video images of fighting and decimation dried up			2
rebel leaders accused the government of creating the blackout to hide its mass killings from the outside world			0
at least 165 people have been killed saturday across @entity4 , including 60 in @entity11 and its suburbs , according to the @entity84 , a network of opposition activists			1
at least eight people were killed when a car bomb exploded in the northern city of @entity90 , said the @entity5			2
two other car bombs went off in @entity11 , the group said			0
no casualties were reported in those attacks			0
meanwhile , in a continued attempt to weaken president @entity22 's aerial strength , @entity4 's rebel fighters say they have tightened their grip on territory near @entity100			1
rebels have taken control of a crescent shaped swath of land about 20 kilometers long just north and east of the main road leading to the airport , said a revolutionary council for the @entity11 area			1
the airport is " the gate of death that supplies the regime in @entity11 and its suburbs with more tools to kill the @entity4 people , " said @entity116 , spokesman to the @entity117 in @entity11 and its suburbs in an audio message posted late friday			1
although rebel forces have not taken the airport , they have shut down its operations , claimed @entity116 , which is his nom de guerre			0
" our main goal is to sap the strength of the regime 's air force and supplies			0
" he accused @entity130 and @entity131 of delivering arms to @entity22 's army via the airport			0
the government rejected the rebels ' claim on state - run tv on a banner reading , " @entity11 airport is functioning normally , and the highway to the airport is fully secure			1
" the network aired footage of the airport , along with interviews of employees and passengers , to show that operations were normal			0
the captured swath stretches from the town of @entity150 , almost within a mile of the airport , up to the @entity11 suburb of @entity152 and includes a captured military helicopter airport and a road to connect them all , the military council said			0
despite government bombardments , which have rained death and destruction indiscriminately from above for months upon rebel stronghold neighborhoods , revolutionary fighters have gained ground			0
they have captured military bases , driving out regular army troops , seizing their heavy weaponry and turning it back on them -- including anti-aircraft guns and missiles			0
in the last week , rebels claim to have shot down one plane and two helicopters in @entity4 's north			1
@entity0 's @entity171 went to the crash site of the plane wednesday , and saw chunks of metal being carted off by locals			0
@entity61 secretary of state @entity177 on friday called for ongoing support of the opposition 's " current momentum " via non-military aid to @entity4 rebels in a speech in @entity184			1
the @entity61 and many of its allies have thrown their support behind the rebel movement and openly advocate the overthrow of @entity22 's government			0
@entity192 secretary general @entity191 urged the international community friday , " in particular the @entity194 , " to pull together			0
council members @entity195 and @entity130 , which are allies of @entity22 , are at loggerheads over the handling of the crisis with the other permanent members @entity202 , @entity203 and the @entity61 , which oppose @entity22			0
@entity191 said he would soon visit @entity4 refugees who have fled over the borders to neighboring countries			2
more than 42,000 people have died in the @entity4 conflict since the uprising began in march 2011 , according to opposition activists			1
@entity0 can not confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within @entity4			1
@entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
