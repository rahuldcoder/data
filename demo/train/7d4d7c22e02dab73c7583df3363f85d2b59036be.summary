-- world number one @entity1 eased any concerns over his ankle injury with a comprehensive win over @entity6 as the @entity8 eyes his third title at the @entity10			1
the 2008 and 2011 champion twisted his right ankle in a @entity14 match last month before appearing to damage it again in last week 's @entity17 defeat to @entity18			1
at @entity19 however , @entity1 needed just 70 minutes to rally from an early break to beat qualifier @entity21 6 - 2 6 - 3			1
the six - time grand slam winner says the display is a step on the road to performing at this month 's @entity27 as well as at @entity28 in june			0
" it was a good performance , even though i know i can do better , " @entity1 , who has reached the @entity10 final four times in the last five years , told reporters			1
" i know my game has to be better in order to win my next challenge			0
but i 'm heading in a good way because i did n't have a great week in @entity17 and did n't have much practice			2
" i came here very early ; from wednesday i spent a lot of hours on the court working hard , trying to prepare myself for what 's coming up this week and also after the tournament in @entity10 -- two @entity41 in less than a month 's time			2
" it 's a very important period for all of us and i need to be physically , mentally , fresh and fit and i think i 'm on the right way to be like that			1
" the @entity27 gets underway in @entity47 on may 26 and finishes on june 9 , just over a fortnight before the start of the @entity28 championships			0
@entity51 , whose return to action in @entity17 after a two - month break ended with a third - round loss to @entity57 's @entity56 , also eased through to the third round after beating @entity60 wild card @entity61 6 - 1 6 - 2			1
meanwhile , @entity62 gained some family revenge when beating @entity64 , who knocked sister @entity65 out in the first round , in straight sets			0
the world number one 's comfortable day against the rising @entity69 was in stark contrast to many of her seeded colleagues , three of whom crashed out on tuesday			0
@entity74 's fourth seed @entity75 was the highest to fall , losing 6 - 7 6 - 1 6 - 2 to @entity76 of @entity77 in the second round , but she may have gained some consolation by seeing sister @entity80 inflict defeat on 15th seed @entity82			1
tenth seed @entity83 of @entity85 also failed in her bid to reach the second round , as the former world number one let slip a 5 - 2 lead against 48th - ranked @entity89 in a third set tiebreak			0
the girlfriend of golfer @entity92 has struggled on clay this season , exiting in the first round in both @entity96 and @entity97 over the last month , and now succumbing at the first hurdle once again			0
@entity89 , 21 , ended a poor run of form as the @entity8 claimed her first victory since the @entity102 in january			2
2011 @entity28 winner @entity103 became the first woman into the third round as she beat @entity97 's @entity106 in another match that went to three sets .			0

@entity1 and @entity51 put @entity17 behind them as they *cruise* into @entity10 third round
@entity8 allays ankle fears as he prepares for ' important period '
