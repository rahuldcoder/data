" i 'd never been near a race track in my life , " explains @entity0 , a former @entity1 skier who belongs to an exclusive band of @entity4 drivers			1
there are only five members -- and they are all female			0
" for many years i lived near @entity9 ( a race track in southern @entity11 ) and could hear the cars going round , but i never had any interest in going over there			2
" @entity0 was captain of the @entity17 women 's ski team and competed at three @entity1 from 1964 to 1972 , but it was not until she hung up her poles that her story took a remarkable twist			1
just under a month shy of her 32nd birthday , she became only the third woman to enter an @entity4 race at the @entity25 , completing an incredible career change			1
" when i stopped ski racing i started a shop in @entity30 selling ski wear , " @entity0 told @entity27			2
" it was a complete change of pace to me and i got a little restless			0
" one day the telephone rang and a gentleman asked me if i 'd like to go in for a celebrity race for sports people			2
i came second in the race and a lot of people were surprised that in my first race i had come second			0
" @entity42 ( formerly in charge of the @entity17 's @entity45 circuit ) invited me to race against the women drivers who were racing and again i came second			1
that sort of started my career			0
" it was a career which propelled @entity50 into the male - dominated world of @entity4 , where only five women have entered a grand prix in its 61 - year history and only two have successfully qualified for a race			1
" i think i was quite well known because a lot of publicity followed me around and most people seemed to think i was qualified to race at that level , " said @entity0 , who entered two further grands prix with the @entity59 team at the start of the 1978 season			1
" the downside was the car i was driving , not the team because they were top notch -- they had run ( 1976 world champion ) @entity70			0
but the car was old and not particularly competitive			0
" the first woman to test herself against the men was @entity75 's @entity74 , who made history at the 1958 @entity77 -- a race which also saw the sport 's future supremo @entity79 make his bow			1
@entity82 failed to qualify in @entity83 , but a month later in @entity84 , in a race with no cut - off time for qualification , she started in last position on the grid			0
in a contest which saw nine of the 19 - strong field retire , @entity82 guided her @entity92 around the spa track but finished right at the back			0
her compatriot @entity95 is the most successful female driver so far			2
in a three - year spell , @entity95 entered 17 grands prix for march , @entity98 and @entity99 , competing in 12 races			1
she became the first and only woman to score in the elite division of motorsport , when a fifth - place finish at the @entity104 while racing for march earned her half a point instead of the usual one because the race distance was shortened			1
hot on the heels of @entity95 was @entity0 , who , inspired by her @entity75 forerunners , entered the sport in 1976			1
" like everything , motorsport was male - dominated for many years but there were many , many women who raced ... @entity95 was extremely good , " the 67 - year - old said			1
" she was extremely strong as well , she had a good car and she did very well in it			0
so there have been good women drivers in @entity4			1
" @entity0 believes strength is essential if women are to deal with the physical rigors of a grand prix and the media attention which comes with their unique status			1
" to drive in my day you had to be fit , " she said			0
" luckily i came off a skiing career and i was massively fit , i was built like a tank			0
nowadays , i 've seen a lot of women drivers who are extremely good , but as they move up the formula , they 're not quite strong enough			0
" often they make some mistakes because they get fatigued			0
of course , men get tired in those cars too , it 's not just women			2
" especially the modern @entity4 car , it creates enormous g - force , and the tracks nowadays do n't have many straights so you 're always turning and there is a lot of work to do			2
" constantly dealing with the world 's media is also difficult , according to @entity0			1
" it 's tiring enough to drive an @entity4 car , but when you get out and are pounced on by thousands of journalists from all over the world you really get pretty exhausted			1
i think that 's something that women do n't understand , " she said			2
" you 're not just driving the car and getting out of it and disappearing into your motor home , you actually are then at the mercy of the world 's press			0
" @entity163 's @entity162 was the next woman to enter a race in 1980 , and it has been almost 20 years since @entity166 drove for @entity167 in 1992 , but recently there have been reports claiming that @entity170 will sign @entity171 as the team 's third driver			1
the @entity174 has previously raced in the @entity175 and tested for @entity170 earlier this year			0
@entity0 said the 31 - year - old must ready for the physical challenge if she is to drive in @entity4			1
" my concern for her is not that she would be an ambassador , which she would be , and i 'm sure she would do a wonderful job , " @entity0 said of @entity178			2
" but when she actually gets in the car i 'm wondering if she 'll be fit enough			0
" i would be in the gym most of this winter trying to lift heavy weights and get my neck muscles going and just make sure i 'm strong enough			0
i do n't know her , but i think that would be my advice			0

@entity17 's @entity0 is one of only five women to have entered an @entity196
prior to moving into motorsport , @entity0 was a @entity1 skier
@entity0 made her *f1* bow at the 1976 @entity17 *gp* , but never qualified for a race
@entity75 's @entity95 is the only one woman to have scored a @entity4 point
