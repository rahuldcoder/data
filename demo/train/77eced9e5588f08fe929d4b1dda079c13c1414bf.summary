-- at the small worktable in @entity4 's sunny @entity3 office , smooth slices of agate -- some as small as coins , others as big as dinner plates , in swirling shades of sapphire , rust , and olive -- mingle with wrist - thick hunks of faceted crystal , three knobby yellow gourds , and a dried version of @entity4 's latest muse			1
" a neat thing about sea fans , " says @entity4 , 39 , who is wearing silver sea - fan - shaped earrings , " is how they move			1
" she imitates the meshlike creature 's undulations with her hand			1
" they 're at the whim of the current ; they get their nutrients from whatever happens to pass through			2
" she lifts the stainless steel colander / fruit bowl she recently designed based on her sea fan research , its sides veined with silver tendrils			2
if a sea fan mated with a @entity38 , this would be the result			2
i 'm spending today dipping a toe into the ocean of @entity4 's creative output -- and the colander is just one of the creatures in a vast and lively sea			1
the woman draws , sews , sculpts , and dreams things up as naturally as the rest of us breathe			1
for her company , @entity52 , she designs coasters , clocks , and picture frames from those pieces of agate , along with handblown - glass napkin rings , amethyst bottle stoppers , and lacquered wooden boxes -- and at home , her creative juices just keep on flowing			0
over eight hours with @entity4 , i 'll discover that her default thought process works like this : that [ sea fan , kangaroo , hunk of quartz , sequined fabric ] is fascinating			1
i must learn all about it and then make something ! next comes studying , sketching , model - making , and finally , the finished product -- which might be anything from a letter opener to a medical device to a fetching new cape			0
@entity0 : how one woman was saved by a poem when i arrived this morning at @entity4 's apartment , she told me that a full day lay ahead : we 'd go shopping for supplies to create a prototype of a new @entity52 bowl ( a mission that would require walking about 40 city blocks ) , we 'd have searching discussions about creativity , and we 'd get our hands really dirty			1
hey , who ever said innovating was a cakewalk ? " i tell my students , ' if it 's easy to create , someone has probably already created it , ' " says @entity4 , who teaches product design at @entity94			1
" work through the setbacks , and you can make things no one else has			1
" like the unique items in @entity4 's home , for example			1
the light fixture that resembles an upside - down red umbrella			0
the key ring of plastic doodads she assembled for her 1 - year - old , @entity112 , to teethe on			0
( " her body is telling her to bite			0
she must bite ! so i give her these , to keep her from biting me			0
" ) the little cloth squares she sewed for @entity112 and her 3 - year - old brother , @entity116 , to sleep with -- they 're soft and worn , and hand - embroidered with trees and abstract whorls and the babies ' initials			0
" i cut them from my husband 's old t - shirts , " says @entity4 , whose husband , @entity122 , is a lawyer for the @entity123			1
even @entity4 's home is an @entity4 original : three years ago , she and @entity122 bought a dim studio in a former sewing factory , then gut - renovated the space into a snug two - bedroom nest , with floor - to - ceiling windows and a kitchen bedecked in vintage red tiles			1
@entity4 's mother , @entity137 , arrives to take @entity138 to baby dance class just as @entity4 is describing her collaborations with @entity142 's @entity141			1
" my dad made surgical instruments , " says @entity4 , who has helped create an artificial knee and an assistive device for people recovering from elbow surgery			1
" he was a pediatric ophthalmologist and surgeon			0
he taught me how to sew and solder			0
" " she has her father 's hand - eye coordination , " @entity137 chimes in			1
" and such fine - motor control			0
" " thank you , " @entity4 says , looking moved			1
she pulls out her sewing kit from the 1890s -- her father , who died in 2001 , bought it at an antiques market			0
" look at all these crazy needles , " she says			0
there are thick needles , teeny needles , needles that look like fish hooks			0
" i sew by hand , " she tells me , " so the project will be imbued with my love			1
" @entity0 : how to write a poem after @entity137 and @entity112 depart , @entity4 and i go on a coffee run			1
i ask her about @entity173 's @entity172 in @entity174 -- where she was the third - ever person to graduate with both an mfa in design and an @entity177 in engineering			1
for her thesis , she traveled to @entity180 , enticed kangaroos to bounce on treadmills while she tracked their motion using high - speed video , and created chairs that mimic their movements			2
" a kangaroo uses its tail like a third leg , leaning on it to push off for the next hop , " @entity4 explains			1
when you sit in her kangaroo chair , it reclines on its curved tail and gently bounces forward -- like a movie theater seat only much more fun			0
while i 'm still processing the concept of marsupial furniture , @entity4 is already onto the business at hand : buying materials for the @entity52 bowl prototype			1
she 's envisioning a ceramic vessel encrusted with crystal - like formations -- sort of an inside - out geode			2
she 'll make the mock - up with real crystal , using clay to affix the stones to a steel mixing bowl , then create a mold of the whole piece , which she 'll use to cast the ceramic version			2
beneath her desk , wrapped in @entity217 newspaper , is 50 pounds of @entity219 crystal waiting for its shot at glory			0
to find the right steel bowl , we visit a baking shop			0
the place is packed ceiling - high with little objects that light up all kinds of circuits in @entity4 's mind : shiny pastry tips ( " these could be molds for crystal - covered salt and pepper shakers " ) , cardboard cake bases laminated in gold paper ( " we 'll use this as a work surface -- the gold feels auspicious " ) , and an accordion squeeze bottle ( " i do n't know why , but i need this " )			1
on the way out , @entity4 marvels at pouches of red , brown , and yellow goo -- pastry filling , it turns out -- and decides it 's lunchtime			1
as she eats her chicken - chermoula sandwich , bought from a food truck on @entity248 , @entity4 says , " there 's this book called ' i stink ! ' " " i stink ? " " it 's about a garbage truck that adores gross stuff , " she says , " like dog poop and fish heads			1
@entity116 laughed and laughed when my husband read it to him , because it 's a bit mischievous			2
kids have to follow so many rules , but a book like ' i stink ! ' lets them be vicariously rascally without breaking the rules			0
the rule is that the object has to perform its function			0
but within that rule , you can do anything -- the object can be witty or silly or weird			0
" we nod , considering this			0
" you stink , " i say			0
" i stink ! " @entity0 : essential pleasures after lunch , we head downtown to buy clay from the art supply store -- though @entity4 beelines for the gift wrap and letterpress stationery ( " this is paper geek heaven ! " )			1
in the pen aisle , she laments that her favorite model , the pilot @entity286 , has been unavailable for the past year			0
in its place she 's been using pens her @entity292 students brought her from their visits home			2
she puts a squat , gray felt - tip to a sheet of paper , moving her arm as decisively as a symphony conductor			0
" that 's what 's called an emotive line , " she says			2
in the way a jagged line might suggest turmoil and a squiggle could evoke confusion , @entity4 's ascending swoop reads joie de vivre			1
then she draws a guy with big curly hair			0
back at the office , she puts on @entity313 's " @entity321 " and lays out the gold work surface , the gray clay , and translucent columns of crystal in sizes ranging from raspberry to cucumber			2
we begin cocooning the bowl with clay for the crystals to smoosh into , as i explain that i 'm much too impatient to be good at making things			2
" i 'm always rushing to finish , " i tell her			0
" i do n't have it in me to keep refining until it 's perfect			2
" looking at the prototype , it seems i 've proven myself right : one side is stunning , and the other side is mine			0
@entity4 has anchored two eight - inch columns of quartz in the clay surrounding the bowl and is now accentuating them with smaller satellite crystals			1
she 's edging the place where the clay meets the rock into a kind of cuticle to the crystal 's nail			2
if you squint , you can envision the final product : an improbable , precious thing , plucked from the @entity349 and yet made by a human hand			0
@entity4 turns the cardboard and considers my work			1
she adds more cuticles , tweaks the angles of the crystals , and carves where i 've over-clayed			0
but for all her refining , what i 've contributed -- my inter-crystal spacing , rim - smoothing , and reinforced clay base -- remains			0
it 's just been gently @entity363			2
" this is really interesting work ! " she says , seeming to sense my hunger for praise			0
@entity4 likes to say that a designer must understand human need : check			1
a designer must also find creative potential in what 's around her , and @entity4 does -- in bouncing kangaroos and ratty t - shirts and charmless studio apartments			1
think of her as a human sea fan , open to the myriad unknown things riding the current , which she uses to make the world a little more fascinating , and a little more @entity4 , than it would otherwise be			1
