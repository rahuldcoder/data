-- he provided the sense of dread to @entity5 's journey upriver in " @entity6 , " but for musician and " soundscape ecologist " @entity7 the authentic sound of the wild can be more disturbing than any synthesized film score			2
" i 'm not a very religious person but the living world is speaking to us in very profound ways and it 's telling us we 'd better pay some attention , " he said , speaking from his home in @entity14			1
for 44 years @entity20 has traveled across the globe recording the sounds of the natural world and has amassed an archive of more the 4,500 hours and over 15,000 individual creatures			1
but perhaps the most remarkable part of @entity20 's back catalog of nature 's orchestra is that that around 50 % comes from now silent or extinct habitats			1
" i believe that we 're in danger of losing this important part of our lives very quickly , " he said			2
crouching in a pitch - black jungle while a jaguar growls nearby or recording the sound of ants " singing " is a long way from @entity20 's early career as a musician			1
part of the 1960s folk quartet " @entity46 , " he then became one of the first musicians to use a @entity49 and experiment with synthesizers			2
it was when recording natural sound with his musical partner @entity53 for 1970 album " in a @entity56 " that he had his acoustic epiphany			1
" my parents hated nature , they considered a bonefish dangerous			1
we had no animals in the house when i was growing up and i really missed that			2
going out in the field ( to record ' in a @entity56 ' ) i realized at 30 years old how much i had missed , " he said			0
" i decided right then and there it would be a life - changing event			0
little by little i spent more time in the field recording			0
" while continuing other work , including writing books and the film scores for " @entity75 , " " performance , " and @entity79 's @entity78 epic , @entity20 ventured into pristine landscapes across the world			1
yet it was not until a 1983 trip to @entity84 that he developed a theory to match his endeavors			0
" i discovered that the voices coming from only animals was very much like music			0
i realized that when all of these critter found these niches , a bandwidth so that all their voices can be heard -- just like instruments in an orchestra -- that a habitat was healthy , " he said			0
100 most endangered animals named in report this " biophony , " as @entity20 calls it , can be studied as a marker of an eco-system 's health			1
while some in the scientific community remain skeptical of @entity20 's ideas , they have been adopted by university courses in the @entity111 , and aided the study of ecology			1
now in his 70s , @entity20 is resolved to keep up his field work , if need be by capturing soundscapes with digital recorders tucked into his pockets or tiny mics attached to his shoulders to avoid arousing unwanted attention			1
from noises that inspire primal fear to fascination , what he hears never fails to surprise and intrigue him			0
" the most remarkable thing is the smaller critters , like sea anemones making noise , even viruses have a sound			0
every living organism creates an acoustic signature that makes it unique and special , " he said			0
" a coral reef that is alive has many different sounds , each fish species has their own signature , some gnaw on coral , others make noise with their swim bladders			2
a living reef is filled with all kinds of racket going on , whereas a reef under stress , dying or dead has almost no sound apart from the lapping of the waves above			0
" @entity156 nations create largest marine park this quieting of nature is not only alarming for the natural world but unhealthy for humans , too , believes @entity20			1
" the ( loss of forests ) on people ( who live there ) is profound			0
there 's an element of stress that has been introduced into their lives , because they can no longer hear the voices that are narrative of place , part of their spiritual and cultural roots			2
when these place disappear it 's like they lose part of their home			0
" the further we ( as the human race ) grow away from the natural world , the quieter the natural world becomes and the more pathological we become as a culture			1

@entity20 has recorded more than 4,500 hours of the sounds of the natural world
more than 50 % of his archive comes from places that no longer exist in the same form
*coined* the term ' biophony ' for the organized musical soundscapes of nature
