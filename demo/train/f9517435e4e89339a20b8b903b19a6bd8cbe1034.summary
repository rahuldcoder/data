@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 used to be an architect , but she gave up her successful career for her passion : looking after mistreated animals			1
it is not a popular cause in her native @entity1 , a country still healing from years of civil war			1
here , unemployment , poverty and political stability are more pressing concerns for most people			0
@entity3 , 47 , is a vice president of a shelter on the outskirts of @entity0 for 250 animals that have survived abandonment and cruelty			1
among the animals she cares for are @entity22 , a dog who survived being doused in gasoline and set alight , @entity26 , who was dumped from a car and then hit by another car , and @entity29 , a @entity30 who was shot in the face			2
her shelter once even took in a lion cub , which had been living on bread and dirty water in an abandoned building			2
@entity3 cries as she explains why these animals had to come before her career , but says she has no regrets			2
" i left my career for that , " she said			0
" i care because that 's the only thing i care about			0
there is no more nature in @entity1			1
it 's all about money			0

" her organization , @entity0 for the @entity50 , or @entity51 , has looked after more than 1,500 dogs , cats and other animals since it opened in 2004			1

also on inside the @entity64 : lions , tigers become problem pets in the @entity68 now it risks losing its temporary shelter in a smart district overlooking @entity0 because of complaints from neighbors			1
" we have villas behind us and they are suing us			0
they want us out , " said @entity3			0
" now we have to find a land			0
the problem is nobody wants to have dogs around them			2

@entity82 , a social - affairs volunteer at @entity51 , said she has met government officials a few times but found they had different priorities			2
she agrees that there are many other priorities in @entity1 , but believes animal rights and human rights go hand in hand			1

" we can not forget about something if there 's something else going on in the world			0
she added : " studies show that animal abuse is very , very extremely related to human abuse			1
" also on inside the @entity64 : @entity111 foodies ditch fast food for fine dining @entity82 and @entity51 would like to see more education about animal abuse			1

i try to educate and raise awareness among the people			0
" @entity51 has begun a pioneering program with @entity127 , a charity for sick and disabled children , to introduce dogs to young patients			0

@entity138 - @entity137 , vice-president of @entity127 , said : " we had some children who did n't speak at all and with the dogs they really started to manage and to speak ... and to speak to others and to play			2
i think dogs therapy is a very good thing for children			0
