of all the @entity1 he 's worked , and he 's done a half - dozen of them , @entity0 figured this one would be pretty easy			1
the weather was cool , so the runners probably would n't be at much risk for heat stroke or dehydration			1
maybe he 'd help people with muscle cramps or twisted ankles , but not much more than that			2
@entity0 , a nurse for 18 years , started his day monday with the elite athletes in @entity13 toward the start of the race			1
once those runners were well on their way , he transferred to @entity18 at the finish line			2
he was talking to a group of doctors and nurses when they heard the first explosion			0
instantly , a team meant to tend to the achy and exhausted became a trauma team			0
the first step : those who did n't have experience with trauma stepped aside			1
those with experience dashed out in the direction of the noise			1
@entity0 , who works in the intensive care unit at nearby @entity35 , had experience			1
" i ran out and saw people who were missing legs and part of their face and part of their abdomen , " he said monday evening			2
" my training prepared me for what to do , but nothing can ever really prepare you for what you see			0
" @entity0 was one of a team of dozens of doctors and nurses who volunteered at monday 's @entity52			1
they worked quickly to stop bleeding and start ivs so patients could get into ambulances and to hospital emergency rooms			0
they treated dozens of patients without proper supplies for severe trauma , such as dressings and pain medications			0
" no one expects to work at the @entity52 and end up at a terrorist attack , " he said			1
one of his first patients was a young woman , he thinks maybe 20 or 22 years old , whose abdomen was torn open			1
her left leg was broken and facing the wrong way and she was n't breathing			2
he and his colleagues did cpr on her and kept checking for a pulse , but there was none			0
they stopped when they realized it was futile			0
she became the first patient in their makeshift morgue			0
@entity0 and others checked her pockets for a wallet , an @entity85 , a cell phone , anything that would help them find her parents ' names			1
" i still do n't know who she was , " he said			2
" she had blonde hair , blue eyes , the all - american girl			0
she was probably a student somewhere in @entity100			0
" " i 've seen people die all over the world , but i 've never been this upset or angry in my career , " @entity0 said			1
" this is the @entity52			0
people come from all over the world and all of a sudden that world exploded on them			0
" working alongside @entity0 in @entity18 was @entity109 , a nurse in the emergency room at the @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113			1
@entity109 did n't run out after the explosion			1
he has plenty of experience in trauma , but as a veteran of the @entity119 , he 's also had plenty of experience with explosions			1
" i heard the first @entity123 ( improvised explosive device ) , and i know there 's never one			2
the bad guys always set up two or three , " said @entity109 , an @entity128 captain who did an 18 - month tour in @entity130 in 2006 and 2007			1
another victim was brought into the tent , a man with his calves and feet blown off and blood pumping out of his knees			0
@entity109 put a tourniquet on him , started an iv , and in 15 minutes the man , who was screaming in pain , was in an ambulance			1
after the second explosion , @entity109 ran out of the tent			1
" there was lots of bleeding , shrapnel , glass			0
it was mayhem , " he said			0
" the injuries were very similar to @entity130			0
" despite the chaos , he said the work of the doctors , nurses and @entity154 was " impeccable			2
" the most amazing thing was how everyone worked in tandem			0
they did n't even have to speak a word between each other , " he said			2
" in 20 years of nursing , this was the most amazing two hours of nursing in my life			0

@entity0 : " no one expects to work at the ( *marathon* ) and end up at a terrorist attack "
one young woman 's abdomen was torn open ; she did n't make it
@entity109 's experience in the @entity119 told him the blast was an *ied*
