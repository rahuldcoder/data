-- @entity2 captain @entity1 braved the public eye despite continuing revelations about his private life , but his table - topping @entity7 team were held to a shock 1 - 1 draw at relegation - threatened @entity11 on tuesday night			1
@entity13 media had reported that @entity1 would miss the @entity15 match to be with his wife @entity16 , who is supposedly in @entity17 to get away from allegations about his infidelity			1
but the defender and father of two , whose role as national captain is in doubt after he allegedly had an affair with the ex-partner of his former @entity7 teammate @entity28 , fronted up at the @entity29 to jeers from the home fans			2
@entity1 scored the winner against @entity33 in his first match since the media storm broke , having failed in his bid to win a court injunction to prevent any such publication , but this time saw his team squander a great chance to move four points clear of second - placed @entity43			1
indeed , the @entity44 needed an equalizer from @entity46 on his return from @entity49 duty with the @entity50 to move two ahead of @entity43 , with both teams having now played 24 out of a scheduled 38 matches			1
@entity7 should have taken the lead in the 25th minute when @entity55 midfielder @entity54 headed @entity57 's cross straight at goalkeeper @entity58 when unmarked in front of goal			2
and the visiting defense were caught out five minutes later when @entity11 center - back @entity62 escaped his marker @entity54 and rose above @entity1 to head home winger @entity65 's corner			1
@entity58 denied @entity67 striker @entity66 and @entity69 midfielder @entity68 , but was powerless as @entity46 curled home a right - footed free - kick three minutes before halftime			2
it was the striker 's 20th league goal this season , and his second against @entity11 this season			0
defender @entity78 should have put @entity11 back in front after the break but headed @entity82 's free - kick over the bar from close range , then @entity1 was booked for a clumsy challenge on @entity86			1
the @entity88 striker should have made @entity7 pay , but completely mistimed his header from @entity65 's delivery			0
@entity7 pressed for a winner , but @entity58 denied substitute forward @entity92 late on to leave the hosts third from bottom			0
meanwhile , @entity95 , the team immediately above @entity11 in the table , were knocked out of the @entity97 after losing 3 - 1 at second division @entity98			1
@entity98 , who were forced into administration last month with debts of $ 48 million , can look forward to a money - spinning fifth - round tie at home to @entity15 high - flyers @entity106 after winning the replay			0
@entity109 , usually a defender but forced into playing up front due to the club 's injury problems , scored three times in six second - half minutes before @entity114 netted a late consolation for the visitors			0
@entity109 had scored just once in six seasons before the match			0
@entity15 side @entity119 also suffered an embarrassing cup exit , losing 2 - 0 at home to fourth division @entity122			1
@entity122 , also in financial difficulties following the failed pre-season takeover which brought former @entity2 manager @entity126 to the club as director of football , will travel to @entity15 side @entity129 in the fifth round			2
@entity65 put @entity122 , the world 's oldest professional league club and the lowest - ranked team left in the tournament , ahead with 15 minutes left as he headed in a corner by @entity136			0
@entity136 was again involved as @entity119 's new signing @entity138 deflected the ball into his own net three minutes later .			0

@entity1 's table - topping @entity7 team held to shock 1 - 1 draw at *struggling* @entity11
@entity2 captain @entity1 played despite continuing *controversy* over his private life
@entity7 lead @entity43 by two points , needing equalizer from @entity46
@entity15 teams @entity119 and @entity151 *dumped* out of @entity97 in replays
