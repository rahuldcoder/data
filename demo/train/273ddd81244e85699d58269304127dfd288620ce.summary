@entity0 , @entity1 -- the number of people forced to flee their homes in @entity1 is increasing and the conditions for the displaced are falling well below international standards , a new study by the @entity7 found			1
in 2012 alone , spreading conflict in @entity1 has forced more than 166,000 @entity11 to flee their homes , bringing the total number of people internally displaced by conflict to at least 460,000 since the fall of the @entity17 in late 2001 , according to the council 's report			1
the numbers alone do n't tell the full story , it says			0
most of the internally displaced people " are living in appalling conditions and in situations of extreme poverty , " @entity23 , protection and advocacy manager at @entity1 , told @entity2			1
@entity33 - @entity32 dynamic holds key to @entity1 's future lack of employment , insufficient food and water supplies , and poor quality housing or shelters -- typically tents or unsubstantial mud homes -- are among the problems internally displaced people are facing , especially during the winter , when their shelters can not offer enough protection against the cold , the report says			1
last winter brought @entity1 's displacement crisis into sharp focus , and revealed the scale of suffering facing displaced people , with reports of " at least 100 confirmed deaths , mostly of children , who died from the cold or illness in @entity0 alone , " @entity23 said			2
one of the displaced people , @entity59 , 42 , fled his home in @entity62 district of southern @entity64 province almost three years ago with his wife and five children			2
now he lives under a mud hut in a makeshift camp in the eastern part of @entity0 , the capital city			0
" i am really worried about what will happen to our children this winter , " @entity59 told @entity2			0
" last winter more than 10 children died just in our makeshift camp due to cold , and i do n't know how many more would die this winter , which has already started			0
" @entity59 added that last year he thought that he would be in a better situation by this year 's winter , " but i was wrong			0
" the study also says that displaced families report facing obstacles to find health services and to access education for their children , with over a third of the displaced children lacking access to schools			1
according to @entity23 , very few provinces are immune from either receiving or creating internally displace people , but the southern and southeastern regions are the main origination areas , and the majority of people go to big cities , especially @entity0 , where security and livelihood opportunities , as well as access to services , is perceived to be greater			1
@entity11 bank fraud siphoned out savers ' money , independent report says the report adds that more than half of the people surveyed identified the @entity17 and other anti-government groups as the key causes of insecurity in their homes communities and the primary drivers of their displacement			1
the @entity7 's study reveals worrying gaps in protection and assistance because of the challenges of collecting information and coordinating responses amid increasing insecurity			2
many humanitarian actors tasked with collecting data on displacement have limited access to those most in need , it says			0
the @entity11 government 's response to the displacement crisis has also been inadequate , the report says			1
insufficient funding , capacity and lack of expertise on the part of central and local authorities means conditions for the displaced , both during the period of their displacement and during the course of their return have fallen well below international standards , according to the study			2
" there is also concern that , as international troops withdraw from @entity1 ( by 2014 ) , there will be less funding available to meet the humanitarian needs " of internally displaced people , @entity23 said			2
there is growing awareness that during and beyond the security transition , more would need to be done to profile the needs of displaced people			0
" but whether the humanitarian community will have time to prepare ( for ) , or the funding to respond to a deepening displacement crisis is far from certain , " he warned			0
