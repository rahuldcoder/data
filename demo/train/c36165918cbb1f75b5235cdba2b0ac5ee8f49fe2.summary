-- senior @entity2 administration officials authorized aggressive interrogation techniques -- including forced nudity and waterboarding -- on suspected terrorists , despite concerns from military psychologists and attorneys , according to a @entity11 report released tuesday			1
the @entity11 report focuses on the authorization to use aggressive techniques to interrogate detainees			1
" the fact is that senior officials in the @entity19 government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees , " said the report , which reveals new details about prisoner treatment at @entity19 military prisons in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
" those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives , strengthened the hand of our enemies and compromised our moral authority , " the report said			0
the full report on the @entity43 investigation was declassified tuesday by the @entity44 , less than a week after the @entity46 administration released several @entity2 - era memos detailing the use of such techniques			2
" in my judgment , the report represents a condemnation of both the @entity2 administration 's interrogation policies and of senior administration officials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse ... to low - ranking soldiers , " sen. @entity50 , @entity51 , chairman of the @entity11 committee , said tuesday			1
" claims , such as that made by former deputy secretary of defense @entity64 that detainee abuses could be chalked up to the unauthorized acts of a ' few bad apples , ' were simply false			0
" the @entity11 report said that in december 2001 the @entity44 's general counsel 's @entity68 solicited information on the " exploitation " of detainees from the federal agency charged with training @entity19 troops on how to withstand enemy interrogation techniques considered illegal by the @entity76			1
the inquiry to that agency , the @entity78 , was submitted more than a month before then - president @entity2 signed a memo stating that @entity19 military personnel " shall continue to treat detainees humanely and , to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity , in a manner consistent with the principles of the @entity76			1
" the @entity11 committee 's investigation was largely focused on the influence of a joint personnel program called " @entity90 and @entity91			2
" the program is used to train @entity19 soldiers how to resist enemy interrogation , and employs harsh techniques such as forced nudity , use of fear , sleep deprivation and -- until last year -- waterboarding			1
the @entity11 report said @entity2 administration officials green lighted the use of @entity90 and @entity91 techniques on detainees -- despite warnings from military psychologists against doing so			1
the report includes an e-mail from an @entity109 psychologist			2
" [ @entity111 ] he use of physical pressures brings with it a large number of potential negative side effects ... if individuals are put under enough discomfort , i.e. pain , they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain , " said lt. col. @entity116 , the senior @entity117 and @entity91 psychologist , in an october 2 , 2002 , e-mail to personnel at the @entity19 prison at @entity122 , @entity20			0
@entity50 said the program is supposed to prepare troops in the event they are captured and subjected to abusive interrogations , and that it was " never intended to be used in the interrogation of detainees in @entity19 custody			1
" in a section titled , " the @entity136 changes the @entity139 , " the @entity11 report noted that less than a week after the @entity78 sent the @entity44 information about the interrogation techniques , the @entity136 issued two legal opinions signed by then - assistant attorney general @entity142			1
the first opinion " presented a narrow interpretation of what constituted torture under @entity19 law , " the report said			0
the memo said that to constitute torture , physical pain would have to match the intensity of that accompanying " serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily functions or even death			0
" the opinion said the administration could defend itself against the federal anti-torture statute by arguing necessity or self - defense			0
the second opinion concerned the interrogation of a specific detainee , @entity166 operative @entity165 , and concluded that 10 different techniques -- including sleep deprivation and waterboarding -- did not violate prohibitions against torture			1
last week , the @entity46 administration released the second @entity174 opinion -- which the @entity11 committee did not have access to during the investigation -- and three others written by then - deputy assistant attorney general @entity179 in may 2005			0
@entity179 's opinions concern hypothetical situations with the same interrogation techniques , as well as some others not mentioned in the 2002 memo			1
those memos also conclude , for varying reasons , that the techniques did not violate prohibitions against torture			2
the @entity11 report reveals new information about @entity90 and @entity91 use on accused enemy combatants held at @entity122 -- which president @entity46 plans to close within a year			0
" by early october [ 2002 ] there was increasing pressure to get ' tougher ' with detainee interrogations " at @entity122 , according to testimony cited in the @entity11 report from a military behavioral scientist , maj. @entity198 , who worked with interrogators at the facility in @entity20			0
so , @entity198 and a colleague drafted a memo proposing aggressive interrogation techniques at the facility			0
the scientist testified that @entity122 's intelligence chief told him the memo needed to contain coercive techniques or it " was n't going to get very far , " the report said			2
@entity50 said that despite " serious legal concerns raised by the military service lawyers , " @entity44 general counsel @entity211 recommended that then - defense secretary @entity214 approve 15 of the interrogation techniques -- including stress positions , removal of clothing , use of phobias ( such as fear of dogs ) and deprivation of light and auditory stimuli			1
after @entity214 's december 2 , 2002 , approval , senior @entity122 staff issued a memo on the use of aggressive techniques , saying , " the premise behind this is that the interrogation tactics used at @entity19 military @entity235 schools are appropriate for use in real - world interrogations , " according to the report			1
the report details how @entity214 's approval prompted interrogators in @entity21 and @entity22 to adopt the aggressive techniques			2
military officials essentially copied and pasted interrogation policies from @entity122 , and posted them as their own in @entity21 and , ultimately , @entity246 in @entity22			0
in september 2003 , @entity249 lawyers raised concerns about the interrogation techniques authorized for @entity246 , which included stress positions , sleep deprivation and exploiting fears of dogs , the report said			1
the report reveals a newly declassified september 16 , 2003 , e-mail from a @entity249 lawyer , maj. @entity258 , who warned that " many of the techniques appear to violate [ @entity260 and should not be used			1
... " dozens of military personnel who served at @entity246 confirmed that the interrogation techniques cleared by @entity214 had made their way to the prison , according to the @entity11 report			2
an army dog handler at @entity246 told military investigators in february 2004 that " someone from [ military intelligence ] gave me a list of cells , for me to go see , and pretty much have my dog bark at them			0
... having the dogs bark at detainees was psychologically breaking them down for interrogation purposes			0
" the @entity11 report said that an interrogator told military investigators in may 2004 that it was " common to see detainees in cells without clothes or naked " and said it was " one of our approaches			1
" @entity50 noted that , despite the revelation of widespread use of aggressive and abusive interrogation techniques , there is still the question of whether the senior officials who approved the policies should be held accountable			2
@entity46 on tuesday left open the possibility of criminal prosecution , saying it would be up to attorney general @entity296 to decide whether to prosecute the former officials			0
" with respect to those who formulated those legal decisions , i would say that is going to be more a decision for the attorney general within the parameter of various laws and i do n't want to prejudge that , " @entity46 told reporters			0
" there 's a host of very complicated issues involved there			0
as a general deal , i think we should be looking forward and not backwards			0
i do worry about this getting so politicized that we can not function effectively and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations			0

lawyer 's e-mail says , " many of the techniques appear to violate " @entity76
investigator says " one of our approaches " was to keep detainees naked
report : officials *encouraged* use of stress positions , phobias , deprivation of light
techniques came from program used to train troops to resist enemy interrogation
