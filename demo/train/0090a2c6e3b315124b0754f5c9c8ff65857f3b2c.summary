-- it seems that in at least one part of the world , the golden arches have lost a little luster			0
the reason lies in a proposal by @entity9 - based fast food giant @entity8 to build a restaurant in @entity11 , a small @entity12 town in the lush foothills of the @entity15 east of @entity16			1
the corporation 's move has sparked a two - year battle with locals , who say they resent the influx of an international restaurant chain and feel that the restaurant will spoil an area of outstanding natural beauty			1
under the banner " no @entity8 in @entity11 , " residents of the town of 2,000 have held several protests against the proposed restaurant , such as the one depicted in this @entity31 in early march , shot by @entity32 and sent in by resident @entity33			1
why such anger over one burger joint ? the reasons are manifold , says campaigner @entity37			0
@entity31 : @entity11 says no to @entity38 's " for me , personally , i will be living only 400 meters from the proposed development , so the issues were litter and traffic , " he said			1
" for young families , it is the fact that it will be built almost opposite a primary school and kindergarten			0
for the local doctors , it 's about health , while others are concerned it will be only 800 meters from a national park			2
" @entity38 's , which says it has kept in regular contact with the local media , community and interested parties over the restaurant plans , has 780 restaurants across @entity12 , employing about 85,000 people			1
amongst the values listed on its website is the promise " we give back to our communities			0
" a spokeswoman for @entity38 's said in a statement that it had been " diligent " in addressing concerns of the community , altering the external design of the restaurant to reflect " the aesthetic of the area " and consulting third - party traffic engineers to ensure minimal impact			1
@entity33 said that the @entity15 were an iconic place for @entity12 and that many were " horrified " @entity8 could think such a development would be appropriate			2
she also said increased traffic , vandalism and crime might affect her children			2
" the presence of a 24 - hour restaurant will mean ( an ) increase of littering , vandalism and worse and the leaving of items such as used condoms or broken bottles , meaning children are more likely to be injured or harmed in some way , " she said			2
for a small campaign , its reach has been extraordinary			2
campaigners have been quick to engage in a pr war , harnessing the power of social media , developing a website punningly titled @entity103 to promote their cause and creating a @entity106 page with almost 6,000 likes			0
more than 75 local volunteers have also pitched in , with one academic spending eight weeks wading through three years worth of local newspapers in the state library to tally up incidents of crime purportedly involving @entity38 's restaurants			1
@entity38 's changes its name to " @entity8 " in some @entity12 restaurants others have helped with fundraising , developed contacts with similar campaigns across @entity12 or attended peaceful occupations of the proposed site , where a community garden was built			1
in february , protesters held a garden gnome " invasion " of the @entity8 's headquarters in @entity129 , a @entity16 suburb , where hundreds of the garden ornaments were placed on the office steps			1
but despite an increasingly fraught battle on both sides , campaigners have stressed that it is the corporation and its franchise holders they have an issue with , not staffers , who they say are just doing their job			0
what they are angry about is what they describe as a lack of dialogue			0
" ( @entity38 's ) say they look forward to engaging with us , so we say come and meet , and they wo n't return our calls , " @entity37 said			1
" they speak with both sides of their mouth			0
" the @entity38 's statement said the company was " proud to contribute to the local community everywhere we operate " through creating jobs , offering training opportunities and providing financial benefits to local businesses and sporting clubs through sponsorships			1
" we have absolutely followed established legal processes to ensure that the restaurant is afforded the same rights and privileges as any other business looking to settle in the area , " the spokeswoman said			0
it is not the first time such a burger battle has been fought on @entity12 soil			1
in 2011 , a proposal by @entity8 to build a fourth restaurant in @entity178 , north of @entity179 , was rejected by the @entity180 , local media reported			0
residents had argued that the site was in a residential area and was an environmental concern			2
in @entity11 , after councilors initially rejected the plan , @entity38 's appealed to a planning court			1
in september , the @entity188 found in favor of @entity8 , and the @entity11 campaigners say they do not have the funds to take the case to the @entity193			0
after months of court battles , site occupations , meetings , allegations and counterallegations , the original @entity38 's franchisee backed out of the project this month			1
a new one has stepped in , but the small success has emboldened the protesters , who feel that victory in this battle could lead to winning the overall war			0
" it 's a case of dollars over democracy , and that 's the heart of any issue that involves communities and large businesses , " @entity37 said			0
" our community is not a cookie - cutter suburb ; it 's unique			2
all those on the campaign want the same : we do n't want a multinational fast food outlet			0
