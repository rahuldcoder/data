-- a former @entity2 , @entity3 , police captain who was convicted of murdering his wife in 1997 has been cleared of the crime and released after more than 14 years in prison			1
@entity7 walked out of the @entity8 around 4:30 p.m. tuesday , @entity0 affiliate @entity9 reported , a few hours after @entity11 common pleas judge @entity10 ruled he was innocent of the crime and ordered him released			1
county officials said they will appeal the decision			0
@entity14 , a popular doctor , was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds in her vehicle in her office 's parking lot in november 1997			1
@entity7 was indicted for aggravated murder the next february and convicted in september of that year			2
he was sentenced to life in prison			0
the case dominated local headlines for months and was the subject of crime shows on national tv			0
although dna tests conducted at the time were inconclusive , the main evidence against the captain was a bite mark on the victim 's arm and lab coat that a prosecution expert matched to her husband 's teeth			1
no weapon was found and prosecutors produced no one who witnessed the killing			2
with help from the @entity44 's @entity43 , @entity7 appealed the conviction and eventually won a ruling from the @entity47 in 2010 that allowed the dna evidence to be retested using newer methods			1
when the results came back , none of the dna evidence could be matched to @entity7			0
" the defendant has been conclusively excluded as the contributor of the male dna on the bite mark section of the lab coat or anywhere else , " @entity53 wrote in her 26 - page ruling tuesday			1
@entity53 also cast serious doubt on the reliability of bite - mark evidence , leaving the prosecution with little to go on			0
" the dna results prove what @entity7 has said all along , that he is 100 % innocent , " @entity66 , @entity7 's @entity43 lawyer , said after a hearing last summer			1
" the court is not unsympathetic to the family members , friends and community who want to see justice for dr. @entity7 , " @entity53 wrote			1
" however , the evidence that the defendant presented in this case is clear and convincing			0
based on the review of the conclusive @entity81 dna test results and the evidence from the 1998 trial , the court is firmly convinced that no reasonable juror would convict the defendant for the crime of aggravated murder with a firearm			2
" she ordered that @entity7 be released from prison " forthwith			2
" @entity11 law enforcement officials were dismayed at the decision			0
" this is a gross misapplication of the law , and we will be appealing @entity99 's exoneration , " county prosecutor @entity93 said in a news release			0
" all of the evidence clearly points to @entity99 as dr. @entity14 's killer , " @entity2 police chief @entity100 said in the same release			1
" he was proven guilty in front of a jury using a substantial amount of other evidence			0
" if @entity3 's @entity110 reverses @entity53 's ruling , the state will have 30 days to file a motion seeking a new trial , @entity93 's office said			2
" i feel like my life is in danger and my family 's life is in danger now			0
( dr. @entity7 and her mother ) are probably turning over in their graves , but @entity125 will have the final say , " @entity119 , @entity14 's nephew , told @entity0 affiliate @entity120			1
" the decision is unfair and unjust , in my opinion , " @entity127 , a niece , told the station .			0
