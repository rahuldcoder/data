editor 's note : @entity2 and @entity3 are attorneys for the @entity5 and co-authors of " @entity7 : a @entity8 from @entity9 to @entity10 and @entity11 "			1
@entity2 is counsel to the plaintiffs in @entity5 v. @entity13 , a lawsuit that has forced the release of more than 100,000 pages of government documents concerning the abuse of prisoners			1
@entity3 is lead counsel in the suit seeking disclosure of photographs of @entity24 personnel abusing prisoners at overseas locations			0
@entity2 says the courts have ruled that refusal to disclose the abuse photos was unlawful			1
( @entity30 ) -- last week president @entity31 announced that he would suppress prisoner abuse photographs that he earlier said he would release			1
given the president 's stated commitment to government transparency , this reversal was both surprising and profoundly disappointing			2
the @entity5 has sought release of these photos for almost six years			1
in october 2003 , we filed a request under the @entity41 for records -- including photographs -- relating to the abuse of prisoners in @entity24 detention facilities overseas			1
in 2005 , a federal judge in @entity48 ruled that the @entity51 administration 's refusal to disclose the photographs was unlawful , and in 2008 a federal appeals court unanimously affirmed that decision			2
the @entity51 administration continued to suppress the photos , and now president @entity31 has vowed to do the same			2
the photos are a critical part of the historical record			2
the government has acknowledged that they depict prisoner abuse at locations other than @entity10 , and it 's clear that the photos would provide irrefutable evidence that abuse was widespread and systemic			1
the photos would also shed light on the connection between the abuse and the decisions of high - level @entity51 administration officials			1
as the district court recognized , the photos are " the best evidence of what happened			2
" in explaining his change of heart , president @entity31 said that the release of the photos " would not add any additional benefit " to the ongoing public debate about the abuse of prisoners			1
but the ongoing public debate is rife with false claims , and the photos would expose the truth			2
the @entity51 administration told the public that abuse was aberrational and isolated , and many media organizations adopted this fraudulent narrative as their own			2
but even president @entity31 , in explaining his reversal , perpetuated the myth that the abuse of prisoners " was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals			0
" president @entity31 's statement was meant to explain why the photos would not inform the public debate , but it only underscored why the release of the photographs is so important			1
many @entity24 still believe that abuse took place in spite of policy rather than because of it			0
the truth is that senior officials authorized the use of barbaric interrogation methods that the @entity24 once prosecuted as war crimes , and even abuse that was not expressly authorized was traceable to a climate in which abuse was tolerated and often encouraged			0
the photos would help tell this story			0
president @entity31 's other rationale for suppressing the photographs is that they would " inflame anti-american opinion and put our troops in greater danger , " an argument that was repeatedly rejected by the courts when made by the @entity51 administration			0
nobody , of course , wants to see anyone get hurt by the release of this or any other information			0
but the fundamental problem with the government 's argument is that it lacks a limiting principle			0
any photograph of prisoner abuse , civilian casualties in @entity140 , or @entity24 military operations in @entity142 could be used to " inflame anti-american opinion " ; indeed , the same is true of any news article that discusses ( for example ) torture , @entity146 , or the @entity148 's secret prisons			1
ireport.com : did @entity31 make the right decision on photos ? to give the government the power to suppress information because it might anger an unidentified set of people in an unspecified part of the world and ultimately endanger an ill - defined group of @entity24 personnel would be to invest it with a virtually unlimited censorial power			1
and by investing it with such power , we would effectively be affording the greatest protection from disclosure to records that depict the worst kinds of government misconduct			1
president @entity31 has inherited a legacy of lawlessness and abuse , and it 's not easy to untangle that			0
but the idea that suppressing the photographs will help the country turn the page on the last eight years is misguided			0
we can not make a clean break with the past until the public knows what happened in the detention centers and why			0
blinding ourselves to the ugly consequences of the @entity51 administration 's policies only deprives us of the opportunity to learn from recent history			0
and if we fail to learn from this history , we are bound to repeat it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity3 .			0

@entity5 lawyers : we filed @entity193 for abuse records
they say courts have ruled that government ca **n't** *withhold* the photos
lawyers : release of photos would show *extent* of prisoner abuse
they say government should **n't** stop release because of possible *negative* *reaction*
