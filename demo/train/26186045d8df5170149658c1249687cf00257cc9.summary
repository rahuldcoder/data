@entity0 -- before @entity3 and @entity4 , before @entity5 , @entity6 and the cottage industry of cable news legal pundits , there was the shocking case of @entity11			1
ten years after his pregnant wife and two young daughters were butchered in their home in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity11 was convicted of the killings and sentenced to life in prison			1
while a jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of @entity11 's guilt , many people were still left with one lingering question : did he really do it ? the drama surrounding the heinous crimes and the subsequent trial fascinated the public for decades			1
it sparked controversial best - selling books , an immensely popular television miniseries and an explosive " @entity36 " interview that was watched by tens of millions of viewers			0
today , more than 40 years after the murders , questions are still being raised about @entity11 's guilt			1
" we 've been sold a bill of goods about this case , " said filmmaker @entity39			1
" it 's as phony as a three dollar bill			2
" @entity39 , an @entity46 - winning documentary director whose acclaimed movies include " @entity48 " and " @entity49 , " has made that opinion the centerpiece of a new investigative book , " a wilderness of error : the trials of @entity11			1
" at more than 500 pages , it aims to prove that an innocent man is in prison			0
" the evidence is neither clear nor convincing , " @entity39 told @entity1			1
" there are many things about this case that rub me the wrong way , but principal among them was how the jury was asked to make decisions about his guilt or innocence with incomplete evidence , evidence that was withheld , corrupted and suppressed			1
" flawed forensic analysis , a contaminated crime scene , damaged and destroyed evidence and an effort to bury a confession all contributed to a miscarriage of justice , according to @entity39			1
" this has nagged me for so many years , " @entity39 said			1
" i felt i should do something			0
" what is not in dispute is what happened at 544 @entity83 in the early morning hours of february 17 , 1970			0
military police officers responding to a call from @entity11 found his wife , @entity87 , beaten and stabbed to death in the master bedroom ; the couple 's two daughters , @entity92 , 5 , and @entity93 , 3 , were in their beds , also stabbed to death			1
@entity11 , who was wounded with two stab wounds and a collapsed lung , told investigators that he was sleeping on the couch when he heard screaming			1
he said he awoke to find in his home three men and one woman , who he described as having blond hair and wearing a floppy hat			0
they were chanting " kill the pigs " and " acid 's groovy " before attacking him , @entity11 told the investigators			1
@entity11 and his claim of killer hippies made headlines around the country			2
they also turned him into a prime focus of the investigation			0
" the story is so bizarre and unlikely and it might actually be true , " said @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity117			0
" it seems too preposterous on its face that a smart guy might have come up with something better , which raises the possibility that it might actually be true			0
" what is absolutely certain is that a military inquiry into the murders recommended @entity11 not be court - martialed , citing a lack of evidence			1
@entity11 was granted an honorable discharge			2
he moved to @entity132 , where he practiced medicine			0
but the case against him was far from over			0
in 1975 , a grand jury indicted @entity11 for the murders			2
he was ultimately convicted in 1979 and sentenced to life in prison			2
" he is almost the definition of an unlikely murder suspect , " said @entity117			0
" @entity143 graduate , medical doctor , @entity142 , these are the kinds of credentials we associate with people at the top of the heap in this country , not convicted murderers			0
" was @entity11 the victim of injustice or a manipulative , cold - blooded killer ? " @entity155 , " the 1983 book on the case by @entity158 , portrayed @entity11 as a cunning sociopath			1
asked to comment on " @entity160 , " @entity158 issued the following statement to @entity1 : " @entity11 was convicted of the murders of his wife and two young daughters in 1979			1
in all the years since , every court that has considered the case -- including the @entity167 -- has upheld that verdict in every aspect			0
@entity11 is guilty not simply beyond a reasonable doubt , but beyond any doubt			2
" a key figure in @entity39 ' bid to show @entity11 is innocent is @entity174 , the woman who confessed to being in the home the night of the murders			1
@entity174 , who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse , and who died in 1983 , testified that she had no involvement in the murders			0
@entity39 said she was encouraged by a prosecutor to alter her testimony			2
" @entity174 was crucial to the defense case because she gave us reason to believe that @entity11 was telling the truth , " @entity39 said			1
" but if you cut her out of the story by pressuring her to change her story , you are going to change the outcome of the trial			0
" @entity193 , the prosecutor who @entity11 said threatened @entity174 , would not comment on the charge because of pending litigation			2
" i was the prosecutor in the case , and i did that job to the best of my ability , " @entity193 told @entity1			0
" i did it in great reliance of the evidence the government had and we presented an honorable case and it was straightforward and it was based on good and competent evidence			0
and i agree with the jury 's verdict			0
" today , @entity11 , who will be 69 in october , still has his believers			1
in addition to @entity39 , they include @entity211 , who served as a legal adviser during the @entity15 military inquiry into the murders			1
" i think those of us that are on the side that believes he is totally innocent ca n't believe this happened , " @entity211 said			0
" this guy has not only lost his wife and kids but loses his career and ends up in prison for the rest of his life			2
" " the army got it right , the federal courts royally screwed it up , " @entity211 added			0
" i do n't think this will ever go away until justice is done			0
" @entity39 doubts the conviction will be overturned			2
still , he is hopeful @entity11 will one day be freed from custody			2
" it 's a principle of fairness , " @entity39 said			1
" you do n't want to convict an innocent man			0

@entity11 's wife and two daughters were murdered in 1970
a military inquiry recommended he not be tried for the killings , citing a lack of evidence
he was later tried and convicted in *criminal* court and is serving a life sentence
today , a new book by filmmaker @entity39 seeks to prove @entity11 's innocence
