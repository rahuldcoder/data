@entity0 -- technology and globalization are putting the jobs of millions in @entity6 's middle class at risk , says analyst @entity8			1
in a cover story for @entity10 called " how to restore the @entity11 , " @entity8 writes , " we have just gone through the worst recession since the @entity13			1
the light at the end of the tunnel is dim at best			0
sixteen months into the recovery , the unemployment rate is higher than it was in the depths of all but one of the postwar recessions			0
... " @entity6 are far more apprehensive than usual , and their worries seem to go beyond the short - term debate over stimulus vs. deficit reduction , " according to @entity8			1
" they fear that we are in the midst of not a cyclical downturn but a structural shift , one that poses huge new challenges to the average @entity6 job , pressures the average @entity6 wage and endangers the average @entity11			1
" the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity38 " spoke to @entity1 on friday			2
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : you wrote in your @entity10 cover story that the @entity6 middle class is being " hollowed out			1
" what does that mean ? @entity8 : well , if you think about it , middle class to most @entity6 means somebody who has a good high school education , somebody who did n't go to fancy schools or grow up in a fancy suburb , but somebody who is working on a factory floor as a foreman , or a manager , or maybe in sales or administration			1
what 's happened to these people is that these jobs have a certain kind of routine nature to them			2
what technology has done over the last 10 or 15 years , it 's become possible to do many of these tasks through computer programs			1
now computer programs need to be monitored and supervised , but it takes far fewer people to do that ... and the people supervising computers need to be more high - end , more skilled people			1
@entity1 : how does that work out in practice ? @entity8 : take the example [ former @entity82 ceo ] @entity79 gave			1
he said information technology been around since the 1980s and 1990s , when it was mostly streamlining back offices			2
now it 's transformed every department from sales to marketing to administration			2
you used to just use computers to streamline , for example , the payroll system			0
now it 's completely ubiquitous , affecting every aspect of business			2
@entity96 's " how to restore the @entity11 " @entity79 gave the example of a company he 's involved in buying			2
it had $ 12 billion in revenue in 2007 with 26,000 employees			0
with the greater efficiency that comes with technology , the same company , when it returns to that level of revenue in a few years , will have only 14,000 employees			0
that 's roughly half the people generating the same revenue			0
that 's the basic dilemma -- companies have gotten so efficient , and there 's enormous pressure on these simple routine tasks that used to employ lots of people			1
@entity1 : is globalization of companies also a factor in hollowing out the middle class ? @entity8 : clearly , the second big part of this is globalization			1
most big @entity6 companies are now global companies			1
the world market has tripled or quadrupled over the last 20 years , as the number of potential consumers greatly increased once the @entity130 system collapsed , and @entity131 and @entity132 liberalized their economies			1
it 's added as many as a billion and half consumers to the world market			1
companies have benefited enormously from it , but these new consumers are willing to work for much less			2
that 's a huge factor , you ca n't deny it			0
technology may be a bigger driver than trade , but globalization is easier to understand -- when you have an autoworker in @entity149 willing to work for $ 7 an hour versus $ 28 an hour in the @entity6 the best way to think of it is that technology and globalization are working together to produce these results			1
@entity1 : you give the example of a radically cheaper car that is being produced in @entity132 ? why is that important ? @entity8 : it 's called the @entity159			1
it costs a little more than $ 2,000 in @entity132 and when it 's sold in the @entity6 , it will cost about $ 7,000 once it has safety features such as air bags and meets @entity6 crash requirements			1
it 's a good car			0
this is a perfectly nice car , looks a lot like @entity167 ' @entity166 , except that the @entity166 costs $ 22,000			0
the most important thing may be the parts -- every part in that car costs a fraction , as little as 1/16 , of what it costs to manufacture in the @entity6			2
so where will the @entity6 car companies get their parts made if they 're trying to be competitive ? they will be tempted to buy those parts manufactured in @entity132			1
you ca n't even call it outsourcing since these are global companies with global supply chains			0
they will invest more in their @entity131 operation , or their @entity186 operation , and less in the @entity6 operation			2
they will be doing what they need to do to survive in a competitive global market			0
@entity1 : so what can be done ? @entity8 : we are going to have to move up the value chain			2
ultimately you do n't want to be making products that people can make somewhere else in the world at half or a quarter of the price			0
you have to take on the more complex aspects of manufacturing			0
the car is becoming two things , it 's a manufactured product , but it 's also a very highly sophisticated computer			1
think of your gps system , audio system and so on			0
each of these components has to be coordinated			0
can we make the high - end aspects of the car ? can the @entity6 be dominant in design , in the computer electronics part of it			1
it 's very tough to be competitive on the pure manufacturing of the chassis			0
@entity1 : what 's the impact on people ? @entity8 : they have to hone their skills so they are really good at this stuff , at the skills of complex manufacturing and electronics			1
i do n't mean to say everyone has to become a brain surgeon , but there 's a difference between skilled labor and highly skilled labor			1
the @entity234 have maintained their manufacturing base because they 've concentrated on complex manufacturing			0
they do n't try to make @entity239 cars ; they make @entity241			0
that means a lot of education and retraining			0
and the most important thing is education			0
you can only retrain somebody who knows how to read and write and do math. to the extent that @entity6 schools are failing at this , there is a basic problem			2
you ca n't retrain somebody who has a fourth - grade reading level , and when they do n't have any basic math in the first place			0
we 've gone from having the best test scores 25 years ago to having the worst in the industrialized world today			0
that 's probably the single most important problem .			0

@entity8 : technology , globalization threatening middle - class jobs
@entity8 says companies have become so much more efficient *due* to computer technology
world market has grown , with many willing to work for far less than those in the @entity6 , he says
@entity8 : @entity6 's middle class must become more highly educated and skilled to compete
