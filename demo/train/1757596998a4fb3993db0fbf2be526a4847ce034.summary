-- " until death do us part " is what generations of couples have vowed at the altar			0
but a legislator in @entity8 wants to give people a much shorter option			1
@entity11 from the leftist @entity12 wants to make it easier for couples to divorce if things do n't work out the way they hoped in the first two years after tying the knot			1
the bill is at the center of a controversy about family values and the definition of marriage in @entity8			1
but @entity11 , who introduced the bill at @entity8 's @entity25 last week , says his measure is simply a reflection of reality			1
" almost 50 % of couples in @entity8 end up in divorce , " @entity11 says			1
" what we 're trying to do is acknowledging reality and creating a mechanism that will allow couples to end their marriage without going through the additional pain and suffering of a legal battle			2
" @entity11 uses statistics from the @entity8 registry to illustrate his point			1
out of 33,000 couples who got married in the past two years in @entity8 , around 16,000 filed for divorce			1
ending the marriage , @entity11 says , costs approximately $ 3,500			1
the couple normally spends anywhere from $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 in legal fees and attorneys and the @entity8 legal system absorbs the rest			2
under @entity11 's bill , couples would sign a marriage contract that would last two years			1
once that term was over , the couple would have the option to renew			0
the contract would specify if property is owned by both spouses or separately			0
it would also state who would get custody of the children , if any , and how benefits would be distributed			0
the bill is now in committee			0
it may take up to three weeks before it is voted on in front of the full legislative assembly			0
if approved , the bill would apply only to couples getting married in @entity8			1
but is there a demand for it ? @entity73 , a sociologist at @entity74 who has researched marriage and divorce in @entity8 , said that at first glance , the proposal seems like an unnecessary law that would simply create more bureaucracy			1
as it is , she said , the majority of marriage dissolutions in @entity8 -- 70 % -- come not from a formal divorce but from informal separation			1
costs , as @entity11 pointed out , are an obstacle to divorce , but to date , couples have dealt with that simply by splitting and starting new families in many cases			1
@entity92 did say , however , that a temporary contract could provide additional protection for children whose parents split , whose needs are often overlooked in informal separations			0
@entity99 , a @entity8 resident , said the bill would benefit many couples who tie the knot in a rush			1
" it 's like renewing your vows ( after two years ) if you want			0
if there 's a fight , they can plan what to do from the beginning " of the marriage , @entity99 said			0
@entity113 , who also lives in @entity8 , strongly disagrees with the bill			2
" if you 're making a commitment to share your life with someone , it better be for more than two years			0
it has to be for the rest of your life , " @entity120 said			0
as a country , @entity8 has the second largest @entity125 population in the world after @entity127 , and many say the bill goes against the beliefs of most @entity131			2
but things are different in the capital , where the population tends to be less conservative than the rest of the country			0
two years ago , the liberal majority in the @entity8 legislature also made gay marriage legal in the @entity131 capital			2
the @entity140 denounced that law then and is strongly opposed to the passage of the two - year marriage bill			1
the rev. @entity144 , a spokesman for the @entity145 of @entity146 and the @entity147 , has denounced the bill			0
" @entity8 is suffering very serious problems precisely because we 're losing family values			2
i think that instead of creating all kinds of comfortable rules for political purposes , legislators should focus on promoting strong marriages and family values , " he said			0
@entity11 , the bill 's author , said the chances of getting the measure passed are good			2
out of 66 legislators in the @entity161 , 34 belong to his party and are likely to vote in favor of the bill			0
@entity11 said he 's working on getting votes from the left - leaning @entity166 to ensure he gets the majority needed for passage			2
@entity0 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			0

legislator @entity11 wants to make it easier for couples to call it *quits*
*newlyweds* would sign a two - year marriage contract , then *decide* whether to renew
the law would apply only to @entity8
