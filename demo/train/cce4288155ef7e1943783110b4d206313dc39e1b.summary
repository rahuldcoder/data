it 's been called " the sacred place where life begins			2
" yet , until a surprising announcement from the @entity7 administration on sunday , that 's rarely what the public has heard about @entity11 's highly politicized @entity10			1
we heard that it was full of oil			2
that it would create a bunch of jobs			2
that it would solve the energy crisis			2
or , you know , maybe not			2
a former @entity24 rep actually said " there 's no wildlife " there			2
but after decades of fighting over data and political talking points , the refuge -- also called @entity10 -- started to emerge for me this week as an actual , living - breathing place			1
the shift came in how the @entity35 announced that it would now treat the refuge as wilderness , which has infuriated @entity11 @entity37 since it could prevent oil and gas drilling on a contentious piece of land , at least for now			1
the administration asked @entity42 to give a disputed part of the refuge a wilderness designation			1
and the @entity46 released a new conservation plan that aims to protect the area			1
instead of arguing the demerits of drilling , the @entity35 basically turned the old @entity52 argument on its head			1
" the @entity59 of the @entity10 , one of the few remaining places in the country as pristine today as it was when the oldest @entity64 communities first set eyes on it , is too precious to put at risk , " @entity54 , a counselor to @entity7 , and @entity56 , head of the @entity57 , wrote at @entity58			1
" by designating the area as wilderness , @entity42 could preserve the @entity59 in perpetuity -- ensuring that this wild , free , beautiful , and bountiful place remains in trust for @entity64 and for all @entity24			1
" instead of " @entity75 baby , drill , " it 's " protect , baby , protect			1
" or maybe @entity79 , president of the @entity80 , put it better : " some places are simply too special to drill , " he said in a statement			2
that 's a sorta new -- or at least very retro -- way of talking about the refuge , said @entity86 , executive director of the @entity87			1
the go - to arguments for environmentalists , she said , have concerned a lack of economic impact from drilling			1
" the most compelling arguments are the ones we forget about using -- and that is the beauty and the special nature and the wildness of the place , " she told me			2
" it 's not everybody 's cup of tea , but the fact of the matter is it is unique			2
it truly is the last great wilderness			0
a lot of people like the idea that there 's a place like that that 's still left , and they want it to be left for future generations			0
" it sounds corny , but it really is the last place we have left to do this			0
" it 's a throwback to @entity119 , the @entity120 founder , who wrote , according to that group 's website , that " our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air , and the scenes in which pure air is found			2
" to underscore the rhetorical shift , the @entity35 released a nature video about the refuge in which president @entity7 says he hopes this " amazing wonder can be preserved for future generations			1
" the administration is proposing that 12.3 million acres of the refuge be protected as wilderness			1
now , about 7 million of the far - north @entity11 refuge 's 19.8 million acres are managed in that way			2
" if @entity42 chooses to act , it would be the largest ever wilderness designation since @entity42 passed the visionary @entity139 over 50 years ago , " the @entity24 @entity46 said in a news release			1
if the administration wanted to take this a step further , it could argue that the @entity10 is not just threatened by oil and gas development in its backyard , but also by oil and gas development worldwide			1
the @entity10 is warming twice as fast as the rest of the @entity148 , according to the @entity149			1
already , substantial changes are being seen			0
" ( the @entity10 and @entity158 ) are kind of the canary in a coal mine of global warming , " says @entity151 , a research scientist with @entity153 's @entity152 , in this video about climate change and the melting of the @entity10 sea ice			1
another scientist in the video says the @entity10 is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet			1
but back to the central argument here : i tend to get overwhelmed by sweeping generalizations about the grandness and wonderment of nature			0
i mean , how wonderful is it ? or in what way ? why should we all be happy it 's there ? so i asked @entity86 , from the @entity87 , to give me a little more detail about what 's actually going on in this epic wilderness			0
what lives there , and why is it unique ? she told me about the porcupine caribou , of course , which migrate along the @entity187 and are somewhat analogous to the migratory animals of the @entity189			0
that 's a parallel that had n't occurred to me before and really puts it in context			0
" like antlered gypsies , barren ground caribou are always on the move , " the @entity193 says on its website			0
" exactly when and where they go is impossible to predict			0
most herds , however , are drawn to a specific calving area			0
the 169,000 member porcupine caribou herd has such a connection with the @entity10			1
" @entity86 told me about the birds , such as the lesser yellow legs and the plovers , which migrate into the " @entity208			0
" she told me how this is " the only place that all three kinds of bears hang out " -- polar , black and grizzly			0
but the factoid that made me most love this refuge was also the strangest and most apocalyptic : there are so many mosquitoes in the @entity10 in the summer that they literally can swarm and kill large mammals , such as caribou			1
they get in their noses and jab their backs			0
it 's so brutal , so panic - inducing , that the caribou retreat to the ocean			0
" it 's really awful , but that 's the wilderness right ? that 's wildlife , " she said			0
well , at least it 's wild			0
so much of the @entity24 has been carved up by people -- from the farmers ' plows on the @entity234 to the mountain - blasting miners in @entity237 -- that it 's comforting to know this place is left			0
bears , caribou -- and , yeah , mosquitoes			0
but maybe i 'm too swept up in this			0
i 'm curious what you think of the president 's framing of the @entity10 -- and his request that @entity42 protect it more permanently			1
do those arguments convince you , especially at a time when oil and gas prices are low and when the @entity24 is already , without @entity10 , the top oil and natural gas producer in the world ? or do you agree with sen. @entity257 , @entity11 , who said called the move a " stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us , our children and our grandchildren to thrive			1
" let me know in the comments or by writing me on @entity267			0
i 'm @ jdsutter .			0

the @entity7 administration asks @entity42 to protect the @entity10
@entity271 says the way the administration made the request is *important*
the @entity35 is arguing , essentially , that the refuge is " too pristine " for drilling
