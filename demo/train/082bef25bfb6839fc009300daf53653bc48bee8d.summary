-- it has become a commonplace that it is hard to comprehend the disaster in @entity5			1
if so , and if we hope to provide @entity5 with anything like the help that they need , then we must understand where our minds fail us			1
one problem that we do not yet face is having our compassion numbed by the sheer magnitude of the calamity			2
indeed , it has evoked a deep visceral response , as we see graphic images of individual suffering on a background of mass devastation			2
when our local tea store is devoting 20 percent of sales to relief and cell phone donations keep pouring in , the scope of the tragedy is mobilizing , not paralyzing			2
the threat to our compassion comes , rather , from feeling ineffective			2
we risk that failure if we can not grasp the realities facing @entity5			1
here , we face two deep mental challenges			2
one is that we must struggle to comprehend how many interdependent threads of @entity5 's social fabric have been ripped apart			1
people lost family , friends and communities in an instant			0
children were orphaned in a nation already struggling to care for many orphans			0
hospitals , factories and government agencies disappeared			0
essential aid organizations lost brave people and resources			2
communications and transportation were ruined , including the port that brings almost all goods into the nation			0
here , imagining ourselves in the @entity5 ' plight might help			1
can we imagine trying to recover , if our country faced the most massive disaster in its history , without work , food , medicine , transportation , commerce or government ? the second challenge is that our minds also struggle to reason quantitatively about events beyond our normal experience			0
here , a back - of - the - envelope calculation might help			0
assume , plausibly , that everything that 3 million @entity5 need must be brought in from outside their country for a period of time			1
assume that each @entity5 needs 5 pounds of goods per day ( food , water , medical supplies , soap , cooking fuel , the gasoline needed to distribute these supplies and more )			1
assume that everything must be flown in ( at least until the port can be reopened )			0
that means 15 million pounds ( 7,500 tons ) of airfreight per day			0
if a cargo plane can carry 75 tons , then that means 100 flights per day , or one plane landing every 15 minutes , then having its goods unloaded and distributed to victims across the country			0
one way to understand what those numbers mean is by analogy			0
the @entity99 was another crisis that required a massive mobilization to supply an isolated population in desperate need			2
@entity104 was cut off by a hostile power , rather than by an ocean			1
it was devastated by war rather than by an earthquake			1
its 2 million citizens needed roughly 5,000 tons of goods per day , delivered through limited entry points , over distances comparable to those of @entity5 's island neighbors			1
the airlift required an unprecedented logistics operation , which @entity121 and @entity120 authorities believed impossible			1
it encountered serious organizational problems in coordinating @entity125 forces among themselves and with our allies			1
it drew resources from other military theaters			0
it was enormously expensive , in both money and the lives of aviators			0
in some ways , supplying @entity5 is easier			1
technology is vastly improved and the world much wealthier			0
but in other ways , supplying @entity5 is even more difficult than the @entity99			1
@entity104 was occupied territory , under @entity141 military rule ; while @entity5 has little functioning government , and those trying to help are struggling to work out their division of labor			1
if we are not thinking in terms of an effort as massive and risky as the @entity99 , then we have not gotten our minds around the problem			0
unless we grasp the complexity and magnitude of the task , then we may be expecting brave , dedicated relief workers to do the impossible -- and be disappointed when they can not do it all			0
as a nation , we may fail to support our leaders in providing the sustained resources that the mission requires			2
if our collective imagination and our sense of history fail us , then we will not achieve the results that our compassion demands -- and will fail @entity5 and its people in their long , difficult road to recovery			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 and @entity172 .			0

the earthquake devastated @entity5 's families , social *networks* and economy , authors say
they say it 's difficult to conceive of the *dimensions* of the need
the @entity125 and others will have to supply essentials of life for a time , they say
authors : in some ways , the aid operation is equivalent to airlift that sustained @entity104 in *1940s*
