a @entity1 man has settled with local authorities for $ 1.6 million after claiming police forced him to undergo " multiple digital penetrations and three enemas " on an invalid warrant and without finding any of the illicit drugs they were looking for			1
@entity11 " feels gratified that the city and county acted quickly , and ... that they recognize his dignity and humanity , " his lawyer , @entity9 , said thursday			0
" he expects that it wo n't happen to anyone else ever again			0
" @entity19 , @entity1 , manager @entity20 , the top official in the county involved in the settlement , declined to comment on thursday			1
and a @entity24 call to @entity25 , @entity1 , police chief @entity26 was not immediately returned			1
@entity11 , 54 , who sued the county and police departments last year , said that he feels he " got some justice , as i think the settlement shows they were wrong to do what they did to me			1
" " i feel grateful to live in the @entity38 , " @entity11 said in a statement posted on his lawyer 's facebook page			0
" bad things happen , but in @entity38 there is a way to get justice			0
" the lawsuit laid out in vivid detail @entity11 's version of his 12 - hour ordeal early in january 2013			1
lawsuit : cops forced man to undergo enemas , colonoscopy according to a police affidavit accompanying that lawsuit , a detective asked a different officer to pull over @entity11 's 1998 brown @entity56 pickup truck for not properly stopping at a stop sign			1
after @entity11 was pulled over , a @entity25 police officer said that he saw @entity11 " was avoiding eye contact with me , " his " left hand began to shake , " and he stood " erect ( with ) his legs together , " the affidavit stated			1
@entity11 was told he could go home after a third officer issued him a traffic citation			0
but before he did , @entity11 voluntarily consented to a search of him and his vehicle , according to the affidavit			2
a k - 9 dog subsequently hit on a spot in the @entity56 's driver 's seat , though no drugs were found			0
" @entity19 k - 9 officer did inform me that he had dealt with mr. @entity11 on a previous case and stated that mr. @entity11 was known to insert drugs into his anal cavity and had been caught in @entity19 with drugs in his anal cavity , " the affidavit said			2
while @entity24 could not corroborate that claim , a search of @entity11 's criminal history indicated he has been arrested several times on drug possession charges , though many of those charges were dismissed			2
outrage over highway body cavity search @entity11 was then put in " investigative detention " and transported around 2 p.m. to the @entity90			2
sometime after that , a judge signed a search warrant " to include but not limited to his anal cavity			0
" his next stop was @entity95 , where the lawsuit states " no drugs were found " in " an x-ray and two digital searches of his rectum by two different doctors			1
" one doctor at this time found nothing unusual in his stool			0
three enemas were conducted on @entity11 after 10:20 p.m. a chest x-ray followed , succeeded by a colonoscopy around 1:25 a.m. again , in all these tests , authorities found " no drugs " on @entity11 , according to his lawsuit			1
" ( @entity115 ) acted completely outside the bounds of human decency by orchestrating wholly superfluous physical body cavity searches performed by an unethical medical professional , " the plaintiff asserted			0
because @entity11 " merely looked nervous during a traffic stop , " the lawsuit claims that authorities ended up violating his constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures on a number of grounds			1
one was that " the language in the warrant was overly broad and , therefore , invalid , " said the plaintiff , asserting that the chest x-ray and colonoscopy , for instance , were n't related or confined to the " anal cavity			2
" moreover , many of the tests took place outside the 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. timeframe for which any such search warrant ( unless otherwise authorized ) is legally valid under @entity1 law , according to the lawsuit			1
@entity11 agreed to the $ 1.6 million settlement on december 20 , according to his attorney , but it became public only in recent days			2
the @entity1 man said , in his latest statement , that he wants to maintain his privacy and -- to whatever extent he can -- not have his " face ... be linked with jokes related to anal probing			0
" at the same time , @entity11 said that he was heartened by those who relayed their sympathy and their own horror stories involving police on online articles about his lawsuit			1
" i felt very helpless and alone that night , " he wrote			0
" the comments i have read on news stories from people have made me feel much better and not so alone			0

@entity11 sued , saying police *subjected* him to " digital penetrations , " enemas
these actions and a colonoscopy occurred over 12 hours in early 2013 in @entity1
authorities never found drugs ; his lawsuit says the warrant used for search was invalid
@entity11 says the settlement gives him " some justice " and " shows they were wrong "
