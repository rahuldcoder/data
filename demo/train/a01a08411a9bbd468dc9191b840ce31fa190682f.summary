-- @entity2 inspectors returned to @entity3 on wednesday to look into at least a half - dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the regime , others allegedly by rebels			1
the team has already confirmed the august 21 use of chemical warfare near @entity12 but did not explicitly say who was responsible			2
according to @entity16 estimates , that attack left more than 1,400 people dead			2
the move came the same day a @entity2 diplomat told @entity0 that three basic premises have been agreed upon for a @entity22 resolution on @entity3 's chemical weapons disarmament			1
@entity25 has basically agreed to the points , but " small issues " remain to be decided , the source said			2
the deal could still fall apart			0
according to the source , the three premises are : 1			0
accountability for attacks on august 21 ; 2			0
binding and enforceable language for measures against @entity3 in case of violations in the disarmament regime or the use of chemical weapons ; 3			1
the council will remain seized of the matter , meaning that further discussion will be expedited			0
the resolution would not authorize automatic use of force if @entity3 is said to be in violation , as was previously sought by the @entity16 , the source said			2
among their tasks , investigators will try to figure out if chemical weapons were used in the northern city of @entity53 in march			1
state - run media blamed rebels for the attack , which it said killed 25 people and injured more than 110 others			1
@entity3 rebels , meanwhile , accused government forces of a chemical weapons attack on the rural @entity12 suburb of @entity63			1
@entity3 rebels reject interim government , embrace @entity65 but the inspectors face a litany of challenges , like trying to find physical and forensic evidence from more than six months ago			0
then there 's the security situation			0
during the inspectors ' last visit , mortar shells landed near their hotel in @entity12 , and their convoy came under fire while en route to a scene			0
and just like their investigation into the august 21 attack , the inspectors will only try to determine whether chemical weapons were used during this trip , not who was responsible			1
@entity0 's @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 contributed to this report .			0
