investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves , @entity21 state attorney general @entity24 told reporters sunday			1

a tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites , authorities said			1
the missing students , who were studying to become school teachers at @entity41 , were mostly young men in their 20s , according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search			1
" help us find them ! " the website says , offering a reward of 1 million pesos ( $ 74,000 ) for information leading to the missing students			1
state officials , who 've faced sharp criticism over the students ' disappearance , released a statement sunday detailing their investigative efforts			1
so far more than 30 people have been detained , including 22 local police officers			2
the police have denied attacking anyone , according to a government statement on their detention			0
but protesters from the school have said officials are n't doing enough			2
" now it is more dangerous to be a student than a criminal , " one post on a @entity66 page dedicated to the school said			2
witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings			0
" the goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had , " one student from the school told @entity77 en @entity78			1

@entity146 among them : who gave the orders to open fire , and what was their motive ? state prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses , and city police opened fire			2
