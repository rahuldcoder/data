@entity0 -- president - elect @entity3 's january 17 train trip from @entity4 , @entity5 , to @entity0 is intended to make the inauguration the most open and accessible in history			1
president - elect @entity3 's train ride from @entity4 to @entity0 will pose myriad security risks			2
but it is also presenting the @entity11 with security problems			1
miles and miles and miles of them			0
in addition to the well - publicized " whistle stops " in @entity4 ; @entity18 , @entity19 ; and @entity20 , @entity21 , the @entity17 says the public will have the opportunity to view the train at other locations along its 137 - mile route			0
but the committee has not indicated where those sites will be , and the @entity11 has yet to release what security restrictions will be in place			1
security experts say the train ride presents traditional threats to the @entity36 on board , as well as countless buildings , homes and warehouses along the route			1
and there are non-traditional vulnerabilities : scores of bridges and tunnels that could be sabotaged			2
and , two environmental groups have warned , terrorists could take a page from @entity51 's playbook , using existing infrastructure , in this case chemical plants along the route , as an attack method			1
in a letter to the @entity11 , @entity57 and @entity58 wrote that they were worried that security efforts focused on the @entity3 entourage " might not extend to the larger community which may suffer serious consequences in case of even one moderately successful terrorist release of ultrahazardous chemicals			1
" " we will be urging mr. @entity3 and [ vice president - elect @entity68 to re-consider " plans to travel by train , the groups wrote			0
in response , @entity11 spokesman @entity70 told the groups , " please be assured , the @entity11 is working closely with federal , state and local agencies to maintain a safe and secure environment for all of our protectees			2
" homeland security secretary @entity77 , whose department includes the @entity11 , said he is confident of the agency 's abilities to protect the president - elect			2
" remember , the @entity11 has taken the president to @entity83 and to @entity84 , to some very hostile places around the world			2
i 'm comfortable that we have the skills , working of course with state and local authorities , to protect the president - elect in @entity5 and @entity20 and @entity0 , " @entity77 said			0
@entity77 said he is aware of the environmental groups ' concerns			1
" i suspect it 's being done , frankly , largely as a public relations ploy , " he said			0
" i do n't think there 's any particular threat from chemical plants along the train route			1
" ireport.com : send your photos from the train stops a former @entity11 agent said the agency has had experience with presidential train trips and said authorities typically install chemical , biological and radiological detectors along the route			1
@entity113 and the @entity11 will not say whether @entity3 's train car will be armored , though experts say special cars have been used in the past			2
" @entity120 will be provided in the air , on the ground and in the water , " said @entity119 chief @entity118			0
" it 's a daunting challenge , but there are many , many police departments that are working together to make this happen			0
" once the train reaches its final destination , the presidential inauguration itself will offer an attractive target for terrorists because of " the historic significance of the nation 's first minority president , " a @entity129 intelligence assessment said			0
the report hastened to add that no specific threat has been detected thus far			0
the document says the swearing - in of the first minority president " increases the potential threat , particularly stemming from individuals on the extremist fringe of the white supremacist movement			0
" but it adds that no such groups are known to have threatened the inauguration so far			0
the report further noted that " lone offenders " not connected to organized groups pose the greatest potential threat because such offenders are often the most difficult to detect			1
the document says there have been some reports of lone offenders making threats but no indication that any of the potential threats " have progressed past rhetoric to operational planning			1
" @entity1 's @entity165 contributed to this report .			0

security experts say trip poses threats to buildings , bridges , tunnels along route
environmental groups say terrorists could use chemical plants along route in attack
former @entity11 agent says chemical detectors could be installed along route
at inauguration , lone offenders pose greatest risk because of difficulty detecting them
