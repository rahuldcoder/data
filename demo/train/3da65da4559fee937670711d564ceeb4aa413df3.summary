the officer , who recently received rapid response training , went to his vehicle to get a protective vest and more ammunition and returned			1

" will you let them go ? you 're obviously upset at me , so why are they here ? " he asked on the video			0
at one point , @entity84 told @entity44 , " i do n't want anybody to get hurt			0
i 've got a feeling that 's what you want , is you want the cops to come in and kill you because you are mad , because you said you are going to die			2
but why ? this is n't worth it			0
" @entity44 then pointed the pistol at @entity84 , who said , " please do n't			0

@entity58 told @entity107 on wednesday that her husband , who she described as having bipolar disorder and unable to get work recently because of his prior criminal record , intentionally fired over the people and did not intend to harm them			2

it was instinct and training			0
" @entity8 told reporters he feels @entity84 deserved the accolades for asking @entity44 to let the other school board members go			1
" @entity41 and his timing saved our lives , " @entity84 said			1

" i 'm known as @entity180 , this nice guy			0
now i 've taken somebody 's life			2
" @entity58 said she has no animosity toward @entity8			1
" i do n't fault you for ( the shooting )			0
i know you were just doing what you were trained to do , and i 'm sorry that @entity54 had to choose you to do that because you are a very kind , sweet , generous man , " @entity58 told @entity107			2
@entity84 said the district would re-evaluate security in the wake of the incident but said he doubted security would have made a difference			2
