@entity0 is holding many more @entity2 hostage than previously thought -- and it is reportedly planning to release a message wednesday threatening to kill them			1
@entity6 , founder of the @entity7 , told @entity1 that the extremist group is now believed to have 150 hostages , citing the latest information from the network 's team on the ground			1
initial estimates put the number seized at between 70 and 100 people , among them women , children and the elderly			0
the video message will be directed to president @entity21 and other members of the @entity24 - led coalition against @entity0 , @entity6 said from @entity25 , @entity26			1
the @entity2 were kidnapped early monday from villages near @entity28 in northeastern @entity29			1
@entity6 , who has family in the area attacked by the terror group , said the latest information from the ground indicated the hostages had been moved to an @entity0 - controlled location			1
the activist organization @entity38 is being slaughtered silently also said on @entity39 that @entity0 has moved a number of @entity2 captives to @entity38 , which has been called the @entity44 extremist group 's de facto capital			1
the last message received from the hostages was a text from a kidnapped woman to her husband , @entity6 said			1
she said the kidnappers were interrogating the hostages about whether the women were members of local militias			0
@entity6 said he feared the hostages would face the same fate as @entity2 targeted in @entity57 and the more than 20 members of @entity61 's @entity60 minority slaughtered by @entity0 in @entity62 last month			1
" maybe they are facing the same destiny			0
that 's why we call on all over the world , like the @entity24 , @entity68 , coalition forces -- protect @entity2 , save @entity2 in @entity29 , " he said			1
" they are facing death , people are unarmed , they are peaceful			0
and they need help , they are just left alone -- no one 's protecting them			0
" @entity6 said some 35 @entity2 villages and towns had now been taken over by @entity0 , forcing thousands of families to flee			1
some 600 of these families have taken refuge in @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity29			2
after years caught up in the middle of a civil war , many of these @entity2 lack food , water , blankets and other basics			2
the @entity2 are a proud group that 's overcome a lot in their history			1
they can trace their roots back some 4,000 years to the time of @entity95 , considered one of the cradles of civilization and birthplace of writing and literature			0
while their first religion was @entity103 , @entity2 have been predominantly @entity60 since the third century			2
" how can @entity29 be @entity29 without the @entity2 ? " @entity6 said			1
" we gave the country our name			0
" @entity0 has proven , time and again , its willingness to ruthlessly go after minority groups who do n't subscribe to its extreme , twisted take on @entity110			2
some of their targets -- the @entity2 included -- have taken up arms in an attempt to defend their communities , fighting alongside @entity118 militia , which have made some recent gains against @entity0 in @entity29 's northeast			1
thus , while kidnapping women and children is unacceptable by any measure , @entity0 going after the @entity2 community in @entity122 may have an element of military , as well as religious , motivation			1
but @entity0 has faced some opposition			2
according to the @entity130 , members of the @entity132 -- or @entity133 -- have taken control of 70 villages in the @entity29 province			2
they 're on the cusp of taking some inhabited by @entity2 and were clashing wednesday with @entity0 forces around @entity28 , the @entity138 - based monitoring group reported			1
embattled civilians are also getting help from the the @entity143 and other fighters , as well as from @entity24 - led coalition airstrikes			0
the @entity130 claims that 132 @entity0 militants have been killed since saturday			2
of course , this is n't the only place where @entity0 has been blamed for atrocities or has encountered pushback			2
the militant group also holds vast swaths of territory in @entity57 , including its second - largest city of @entity154			0
yet @entity57 's once beleaguered military has made progress of late , liberating most areas of the long besieged town of @entity159 , according to the @entity57 @entity160			0
videos released by the ministry tuesday showed convoys moving toward @entity164 and patrolling parts of the city as well as lawmakers visiting the nearby @entity169 al - asad air base , where some 400 @entity24 military personnel are stationed to train @entity57 pilots in the fight against @entity0			0
when contacted by @entity1 , an @entity174 official , @entity173 , said @entity57 security forces aided by @entity24 - led coalition airstrikes had secured about 80 % of @entity164			0
the @entity160 said on its website that it is working to secure the rest of the town			0
elsewhere in @entity174 , video posted online shows @entity57 security forces ' discovery of tunnels presumably dug by @entity0 to give them an underground route to reach a central government compound in @entity189 , about 70 miles ( 110 kilometers ) west of @entity190			1
this can all be seen as progress			0
even then , they 're only small steps toward eradicating a threat that , in many ways , remains as savage and dangerous as ever			0
@entity1 's @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			0
