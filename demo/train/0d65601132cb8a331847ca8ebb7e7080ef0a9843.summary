@entity0 -- internet - based rip - offs jumped 33 percent last year over the previous year , according to a report from a complaint center set up to monitor such crimes			1
the report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of internet fraud were men			1
the total dollar loss from those crimes was $ 265 million			1
that 's $ 26 million more than the price tag in 2007 , the @entity11 said			2
for individual victims , the average amount lost was $ 931			0
" this report illustrates that sophisticated computer fraud schemes continue to flourish as financial data migrates to the @entity22 , " said @entity16 , the @entity17 's assistant director of the @entity18			1
@entity24 filed 275,284 reports claiming to be ripped off on the @entity22 , the highest number reported since the center began keeping statistics in 2000			1
the dollar loss has been on a steady increase since 2004 , while the number of cases referred to law enforcement has decreased steadily since that same year			0
complaints to the center have resulted in several arrests , the center said , although information comes only from agencies that voluntarily provide the results of investigations			0
@entity16 said the figures show the need for computer users , in businesses and in homes , to be wary and use sound security practices while using the @entity22			2
the center said the top three most frequent complaints were about merchandise that was n't delivered or payment that was n't received , internet auction fraud and credit / debit card fraud			2
other scams include confidence frauds such as ponzi schemes , check fraud , the @entity58 letter fraud and identity fraud			2
one popular identity fraud scam used during 2008 involved sending e-mails crafted to appear as if they 'd been sent by the @entity17			1
sometimes the scammers went so far as to say the mailings were from fbi director @entity64 himself , according to the center			0
the e-mails would ask the recipient for personal information , such as a bank account numbers , claiming the @entity17 wanted the information to look into an impending financial transaction			1
one variation of the scheme , according to the center , was to send an e-mail saying the recipient is entitled to lottery money or an inheritance and the funds can be moved as soon as bank account information is supplied			0
the @entity17 has issued warnings about such scams in the past , and monday 's report included a new one : " the @entity17 does not contact @entity24 citizens regarding personal financial matters through unsolicited e-mails			1
" the report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of internet fraud were men , and about half lived in either @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity0 , @entity96 or the @entity0			1
more than 55 percent of those who filed complaints were men			1
but the report noted that anyone who uses the internet can be a victim , and that the ages of victims have ranged from 10 to 100			2
internet crime offers unique challenges to investigators			0
the report said the offender and victim often live in different states and sometimes different countries , requiring multiple law enforcement agencies to cooperate and conquer any issues of jurisdiction			0
another big problem is the anonymity of using the @entity22			0
in most instances , a victim never meets the criminal			0
the @entity121 is a partnership of the @entity17 and the @entity123 .			0
