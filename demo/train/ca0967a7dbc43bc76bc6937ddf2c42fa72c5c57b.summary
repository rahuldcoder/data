-- @entity1 continues to brew controversy , as opposing sides of the nation 's gun debate clash over the giant coffee chain 's policy to support state " open - carry " laws for legal firearms and , where permitted by law , to permit guns in their stores			1
on friday , the @entity14 , a grassroots organization founded by @entity15 , @entity16 , residents in support of gun policy reform , posted on its website an open letter to @entity22 , ceo of @entity1 , encouraging him to ban guns in all @entity1 stores			1
" if you make the decision to ban guns , your company has the chance to honor the 26 innocent lives lost here in @entity15 and the 32,000 @entity33 lost annually to gun violence by becoming a leader in educating the public about firearm safety			2
we know by having observed and admired your continuing advocacy that your company not only understands but takes pride in its responsibility to promote the growth of a safe and just society , " the open letter said			0
" that is why we would like you to invite you to join us for a cup of coffee at our @entity1 in @entity15 at a time and date of your convenience so we can talk about your company 's policy and gun violence in @entity33 ... " the letter continued			1
the letter was signed by 13 family members of victims in the deadly december shooting at @entity15 , including the family of @entity15 , a teacher and @entity1 barista who was killed			1
many other @entity15 residents also signed the letter , as did @entity16 gov. @entity63 , sen. @entity64 , sen. @entity65			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity66 responded friday by saying , " we welcome the opportunity to meet with the @entity15 family members who have signed this letter to discuss their concerns			1
" on wednesday , the group @entity72 -- an organization for what its members term common - sense gun reforms -- called for a national boycott of @entity1 stores on saturday			1
on its website , the group is attempting to gather 25,000 signatures calling for a ban on guns at all @entity1 stores , and plans to hand - deliver the petition to @entity1 headquarters			1
" millions of @entity33 moms visit neighborhood @entity1 , often with their children in tow			0
but many moms do n't realize that they may be standing next to someone carrying a loaded gun inside @entity1 , " the group said			0
the organization allied with the @entity14 and other gun law - reform groups on friday , placing its support behind the signers of the letter to @entity96			0
@entity1 was most recently brought into the gun debate when gun rights advocates staged a national " @entity1 appreciation day , " in support of the coffee shop 's open - carry policy			2
" @entity1 is allowing us to lawfully carry firearms in their store			0
recently , they have been the target of unjust attacks from certain groups that do not support our right to bear arms			0
we will thank starbucks ( sic ) for standing up for our right to bear arms by going there on friday , august 9th , " said the @entity113 page for the event			0
the @entity1 in @entity15 closed that day , but the debate raged on			2
in a statement to @entity0 at the time , @entity1 spokesman @entity119 said , " these events are not endorsed by @entity1			1
that said , our stores are gathering places for the communities we serve and we respect the diverse views of our customers ... we comply with local laws and statutes in the communities we serve , abiding by the laws that permit open carry			0
" friday 's letter to @entity96 further challenged @entity1 ' stance			0
" since your company has been a champion of admirable causes in the past , such as lgbt rights and environmental sustainability , some gun owners in this country cite @entity1 ' stance on this issue as justification of the reasonableness of their choice to carry guns anywhere and everywhere , even into a place as unthreatening as a coffee shop ... we as a society must prioritize the sanctity of human life over the individual 's ' right to carry , " the letter said			2
@entity0 's @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0

where state law allows , legal guns are permitted to be carried in @entity1 stores
a group in @entity15 , @entity16 , wants the giant coffee chain to end that policy
@entity15 was the site of a deadly elementary *school* shooting in december
a @entity1 spokesman says " we welcome the opportunity " to meet with the group
