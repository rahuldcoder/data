-- hundreds of inmates in @entity2 whose fight among themselves spiraled into a riot were back in their cells monday afternoon , leaving authorities to mourn the death of one guard and express thanks that things did n't turn out worse			1
" when we first ... learned of the situation , i had a high degree of anxiety because there were so many guards who were unaccounted for , " @entity12 sheriff @entity11 said , praising the efforts of law enforcement and those with the private company that runs the facility			1
" i know it when i see it when something is handled correctly			0
" by monday afternoon , all of the roughly 2,500 inmates at the @entity29 in @entity30 were secure in their cells on lockdown , which @entity11 said will continue indefinitely as the investigation continues			0
guard killed , several others injured in riot at @entity2 prison , officials say it was a far different scene about 24 hours before			1
@entity11 said that , about 2:40 p.m. sunday , a fight broke out either among members of one gang or between members of rival factions in a prison yard and soon ballooned out of control			1
with a core group of about 300 inmates involved -- meaning most others were simply caught up in the chaos -- the disturbance quickly spread through the grounds			0
" it turned into a mob mentality , and ... it just expanded so quickly , " the sheriff said			2
sometime early in the riot , a guard was assaulted and ended up on the roof of a building , @entity11 said			1
that guard -- later identified as @entity60 , 24 -- was brought out through the facility 's gates within an hour , only to be later pronounced dead due to blunt head force trauma , according to the county coroner			1
the disturbance continued for hours more around the western @entity2 facility , which houses illegal immigrants from around the region who are serving time after convictions for both violent and nonviolent crimes			0
the @entity73 - based @entity72 operates the facility and employs all those within			2
at one point , inmates pulled out some mattresses , rags and other materials into a prison yard and started a fire			2
others used an array of weapons , such as mop and broom handles , in their fight			2
meanwhile , the facility 's employees at once tried to maintain order and take cover			0
@entity11 said earlier monday that at least 24 or 25 hostages were being held at one point			0
county and state authorities were on site within an hour to maintain the perimeter and help the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) bring the situation under control , according to @entity11 , who noted that @entity100 agents were also there			0
no gunshots were ever fired , and @entity11 praised the " restraint " by law enforcement			1
authorities did use " pepper balls , " which the sheriff said are shot from something akin to a paintball gun			2
" the whole thing was probably over by 11 or 11:30 p.m. sunday , " at which point all the inmates had been forced out into a prison yard , @entity11 said			0
but it was n't until 3:30 a.m. monday that every prisoner had been searched and brought back to his housing unit			0
in addition to @entity60 , about 10 workers at the facility were injured , including one who suffered head trauma and was transported about 100 miles northwest to the @entity122 in @entity123 , according to the sheriff			1
@entity72 , meanwhile , has reported that 16 of its staffers at the prison were treated and released from the hospital			0
four inmates had to be taken to area emergency rooms for treatment -- for injuries such as a stab wound , a concussion and rib injuries -- though @entity11 said he did n't think any of them needed to be admitted			0
@entity72 had said three inmates received such treatment			0
the sheriff stressed that the public was never in danger , as the riot was confined within the facility and there were no breaches of its perimeter			1
while he did n't know what exactly caused the riot , @entity11 did say that , " from the outside looking in , i ca n't see anything that would have prevented it			2
" he lavished praise on the decisions made by @entity72 and law enforcement , saying , " i do n't think they could have handled it any better			1
" the sheriff added that the facility has " not had anything of this magnitude at all " since opening in 2009			0
" this could have happened anywhere , anytime , " @entity11 said			0
yet the @entity163 said the riot was n't surprising because companies like the @entity72 " have incentives to cut corners even at the expense of decent and safe conditions " ; they employ " too often poorly paid and trained " staff ; and they run facilities with conditions that " are often woefully inadequate			1
" " this weekend 's riot should make clear to @entity2 and every other state that for - profit incarceration must end , " the advocacy group said in a statement			1
" we need to save taxpayer money by ending the nation 's addiction to incarceration , not give money to private companies whose profit depends on locking up as many people as possible			1

new : the @entity163 blasts " for - profit incarceration , " says the riot was n't surprising
the riot began with a fight among prisoners , a sheriff says
guard died due to what the coroner thinks was blunt force trauma
the sheriff praises law enforcement efforts and the private firm that runs the prison
