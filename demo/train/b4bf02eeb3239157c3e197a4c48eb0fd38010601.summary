-- @entity1 and her family went to the headquarters of the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , to deliver a petition of 300,000 signatures asking the organization to end its ban on gay scouts and gay scout leaders			1
the @entity4 's policy of " not granting membership to open or avowed homosexuals " is a travesty			1
it led to the dismissal of @entity1 , who was the den leader of her own 7 - year - old son 's troop in @entity21 , @entity22			2
by reaffirming its anti-gay policy , the @entity4 is telling the entire nation that maintaining its legacy of discrimination is more important to them than strengthening the bond between a mother and her son			1
the @entity4 clearly has its priorities backwards			1
in spite of calls for change from its own board members , from high - profile @entity36 and from @entity38 of all stripes , it refuses to budge			2
other organizations , such as the @entity41 , @entity42 clubs , the @entity43 and even the @entity44 , have put an end to such discrimination			0
it might not be easy for an organization to admit it is wrong			2
especially since the @entity4 has had this policy for decades ; it has even gone all the way to the @entity52 to try to preserve it			1
but just because you have a right to discriminate does n't mean it is right to discriminate			0
no matter how much the organization digs in its heels , it has to acknowledge that @entity60 's story is widely accessible to the @entity38 people			1
and it is n't only @entity1 and her son who are affected by the policy			0
parents in @entity21 are angry that the @entity4 has put them in the position where they had to explain to their children why their favorite den leader would not be allowed back			1
parents should not have to explain to their children why their favorite after - school activity discriminates against their friends and their friends ' families			0
over the past few months , i 've gotten to know @entity1 very well			0
her eyes light up when she speaks about her time with her son 's troop			0
i 've seen those same eyes well with tears when she recounts what the @entity4 did to her , simply because she is who she is			1
her son , @entity83 , is going to grow into a remarkable young man			0
but right now , he 's a young boy who had been told for the first time , by an organization he wanted desperately to join , that his family is n't good enough			2
@entity1 and @entity83 are n't alone in being tremendously hurt by the @entity4			2
there are countless @entity4 and @entity91 leaders living under the fear that they could be kicked out at any moment , simply for being gay or lesbian			1
someday , this wo n't be the case			0
it is inevitable that the @entity4 will need to change its policy of intolerance			1
i believe the change will come soon			0
and the more we continue to speak out , the more we stand beside moms such as @entity1 , the more we demand that discrimination end , the sooner that " someday " will arrive			0
if the @entity4 's aim is to teach children about leadership qualities and moral values , it needs to start by treating the members of its community with fairness and decency			1
for more than 100 years , the @entity4 has prided itself on building tomorrow 's leaders			1
but it can not continue to do so by clinging to yesterday 's antiquated and hateful biases			0
the time to change is now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity118 .			2

the @entity4 is not granting membership to gays and lesbians
@entity118 : the organization 's policy is a travesty
he says the @entity4 has prided itself on building tomorrow 's leaders
@entity118 : how can it do so with a discriminatory policy toward its members ?
