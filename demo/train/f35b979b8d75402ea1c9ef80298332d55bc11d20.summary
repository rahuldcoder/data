-- a month ago , @entity2 's three - year effort to push its web browser , @entity3 , took a major step when analysts said it had passed @entity7 's @entity6 to become the second-most popular tool of its kind on the @entity10			1
today , that climb continues and has some tech observers wondering whether @entity3 could do the unthinkable and topple perennial leader @entity13 from atop the browser rankings			1
according to web analytics firm @entity16 , the most popular version of @entity2 's browser , @entity3 15 , edged out @entity20 in early december to become the world 's most used edition of a browser			1
( for those keeping score , the totals were 23.6 % of worldwide browser usage compared to @entity20 's 23.5 %			1
) when all versions are considered , @entity3 accounted for more than 27 % of all worldwide browser use at the beginning of december , an increase of about 1.5 % over the previous month			1
that 's compared to about 37 % for @entity13 , which dropped 2 % from november , according to @entity16			1
now in third place , @entity6 remained mostly steady with about 25 % of the browser market			1
trailing far behind is @entity34 , with about 6 %			2
the numbers can vary in the browser race depending on who is counting			0
web surveying firm @entity38 still has @entity13 at 52 % , @entity6 at 22 % and @entity3 at 19 %			1
but that represents a 10 - point drop by @entity13 since 2010 , while @entity3 use more than doubled and @entity6 remained flat			2
@entity42 analyst @entity41 thinks @entity3 has gathered momentum because it is a strong product			1
" people like it because it 's fast , " he said			0
" @entity2 has done a nice job advertising it recently , so that 's increased awareness			2
" since its rollout , reviews have been generally positive about @entity3			2
while some call it a work in progress , many have praised its features and speed			0
" super-fast browsing performance , now with hardware acceleration			0
excellent security through sandboxing and malware warnings			0
instant site prediction and loading , " @entity65 wrote in a review of @entity3 , giving it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars			2
the review also praised it for strong support for the emerging @entity73 coding system amd built - in flash player , while dinging it for still not being compatible with a handful of sites			0
@entity41 also said people are more aware than ever that they have a choice of browsers			0
internet explorer has been the dominant browser for more than a decade , at least in large part because it comes installed on @entity84 machines			0
" this was happening even more so when there was a real big difference between what you could get from someone else and what explorer was , " he said			0
" now , that 's not the case			0
explorer 9 is pretty competitive with the other browsers , so maybe there 's not as much need to go away from it			0
" @entity16 ceo @entity100 attributed at least part of @entity3 's rise to its increased use among businesses			1
" @entity2 announced @entity3 for business exactly a year ago and it administrators appear to have embraced it in a remarkably short time , " he said			2
chrome use already had overtaken explorer on weekends , when personal use presumably trumps office use , since october			0
but @entity3 15 became the more popular from monday to friday on december 5 , he said			0
@entity117 , putting a positive spin on the numbers , emphasized that @entity13 's latest ( and generally well - received ) version , @entity119 , is rapidly gaining ground as use of @entity20 drops			1
@entity119 was released in march			0
( to its credit , @entity117 is also celebrating the demise of @entity124			0
widely reviled by web developers and many users from the start , use of that version dropped below 1 % in the @entity130 last month , with @entity117 spokesman @entity131 writing on the @entity84 blog that the company is breaking out the champagne and " as eager as anyone to see it go away			2
" ) the statistics @entity117 used on its blog , which showed @entity3 use mostly flat , only looked at browser usage on @entity117 's @entity142 operating system			1
the rise of @entity3 comes as @entity2 has expanded beyond its core product -- its search engine -- into such areas as mobile operating systems ( @entity148 ) and social networking ( @entity150 )			1
@entity3 has been a high point for @entity2 in what has developed into a two - front clash of tech titans with @entity117			1
while @entity2 tries to erode @entity13 's browser share , @entity117 is taking aim at @entity2 's longtime dominance in search			1
launched in 2009 , @entity117 's @entity158 has tried to make web search a true two - way race			1
and while @entity2 's stranglehold on that market is still strong , @entity158 has chipped away			1
in december , @entity158 captured about 15 % of the search market , compared to 61 % for @entity2 , according to @entity164			2
one victim of @entity2 's success ( not to mention deep pockets ) has been @entity6 , long a favored browser among tech - savvy types			1
" they ( @entity7 ) were not coming out with a lot of releases and new features for some time , " @entity41 said			0
" they 've really tried to change that in the last year , but perceptions got made during that time frame			0
" they were the ones that were the sole recipient of the browser change -- they were the alternative browser for most -- but now they have to split that role with @entity2			2
" whether @entity3 's rise will continue remains to be seen , he said			1
web users only tend to seek out a new browser if the one in front of them is lacking , and internet explorer appears to have stemmed that tide somewhat			2
" three or four years ago , if you wanted tabs , you had to go to another browser			0
if you wanted something fast you had to go to another browser , " @entity41 said			0
" that 's not the case any more			0

@entity2 's @entity3 browser continues to gain on market leader @entity13
analysts say @entity3 has 27 % of the browser market , trailing only @entity20 at 37 %
@entity3 's rise is part of a two - front @entity2 *vs.* @entity117 duel that *includes* web search
@entity42 analyst : new @entity119 may help slow @entity3 's rise
