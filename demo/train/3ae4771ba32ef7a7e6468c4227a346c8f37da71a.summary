@entity0 -- twenty - five years on from the fall of the @entity3 , much has changed			1
but former @entity5 leader @entity4 says the lessons learned back then could help restore calm to today 's increasingly volatile world			1
speaking to @entity1 in @entity0 , where he is attending anniversary celebrations , @entity4 called for efforts to rebuild trust between @entity11 and @entity12 and for leaders to again work together for the common good			1
" a lot depends on @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 -- they have to work together more productively , " he said			1
" we have to reestablish the cooperation and the trust that has been destroyed			1
we must start by dialogue -- we must meet and not just talk past each other			0
" @entity4 , now 83 , is often praised for his decision to avoid using force to quell uprisings in @entity17 , helping pave the way for @entity3 to fall in 1989			1
while @entity5 leader -- from 1985 until his resignation in 1991 -- he embarked on a process of change and increased openness to the @entity12 that became known as " perestroika			1
" he was awarded the @entity34 in 1990 for helping end the @entity36			0
now , with the conflict in @entity39 plunging @entity41 relations to their lowest point since then , many wonder what might happen next , as a bullish @entity18 seems determined to forge its own course despite pressure from the @entity12			1
leaders today ' looking askance at each other ' while the nuclear weapon reduction agreements signed at the end of the @entity36 still have a positive influence , @entity4 said , current events in @entity17 could undermine the situation			1
" straight after the end of the @entity36 , when we signed those important agreements , we used to be more peaceful , people trusted more			0
people trusted that things got better , " he said			0
" now is a troublesome time			0
let us not engage in mutual accusations , let us rebuild the trust that has been wrecked and let us cooperate , let us look for ways out of any difficult situation , " he said			2
defeating radical groups like @entity67 " requires a common effort on our part , " he said			0
but while the possibilities and the resources are there , leading countries have been looking to serve their own advantage			0
this is wrong , he said , and the first steps to correct it must include political decision making and dialogue			0
some people 's impression that things have moved backward today is correct , he said , adding , " this is because the common approach has been destroyed			1
" when leaders took decisions on nuclear disarmament or on ending the @entity36 , he said , " with all these things we were meeting each other halfway , we cooperated			0
but now we are just looking askance at each other			0
" report : ex-soviet leader @entity4 leaves hospital media ' sow division and mistrust ' @entity4 said some irresponsible media outlets were fueling international tensions			1
the media should convey the truth , he said , rather than taking part in " information warfare " that " sows division and mistrust			0
" he characterized recent reports of @entity18 sending tanks and troops into @entity39 as examples of dangerously irresponsible reporting			2
@entity4 called for those who benefit from manipulating media coverage to be revealed , even if that carries some risk to those doing the revealing			1
he did not single out any media outlets , but said it is up to politicians to prevent " information warfare " while also defending freedom of the press and civil institutions			0
asked what lesson people should draw from the historic events of 25 years ago , @entity4 said : " we made the right choice			2
we made the right decision , these decisions required courage , these decisions required a lot of work -- and this is the only right approach , acting responsibly , acting with a view to common efforts			2
" no one can single - handedly solve the problems of the world today , he said , even @entity16			2
@entity4 : @entity135 must stand firm as for president @entity135 , the former @entity5 leader had some positive words -- and encouragement for the difficult days ahead for the president 's @entity140 , which was hammered in the midterm elections			1
his election in 2008 was a response to the @entity16 people 's desire for change and reform -- their own perestroika , @entity4 said			1
" at first he showed himself as a person who could be trusted , a smart person , an intelligent person , and his first term i would say he was quite satisfactory , " @entity4 said			2
now , with both the @entity156 and @entity157 in @entity159 hands and a raft of other problems stacking up , @entity135 must " stand firm , " he said			0
" it 's not the most important thing to be in power			0
it 's important to withstand the pressure of those who would like to bend your knees			0
" @entity1 's @entity170 reported from @entity0 and @entity171 wrote in @entity172 .			2

@entity4 : @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 must work together more productively
" we have to reestablish the cooperation and the trust that has been destroyed , " he says
