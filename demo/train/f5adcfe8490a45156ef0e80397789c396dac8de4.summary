-- attorneys for @entity2 on wednesday blasted a university - funded review that accused the former @entity6 president of complicity in the alleged coverup of a child sex abuse scandal involving former coach @entity10			1
@entity11 called the review led by former fbi director @entity13 a " blundering , indefensible indictment " and " a flat - out distortion of facts " that was " infused with bias and innuendo			1
" @entity13 's 267 - page report was released in july and blamed @entity2 , legendary football coach @entity21 , suspended athletic director @entity22 and @entity24 president @entity23 with taking part in a coverup to avoid bad publicity			1
@entity29 blasts report , says he was abused as a child the scandal led to @entity2 's ouster and shocked the nation after @entity13 's team concluded that the school 's top administrators had " empowered " @entity10 to continue his abuse			1
@entity13 also said @entity21 could have stopped the attacks had he done more , though neither graduate assistant @entity39 , @entity10 nor @entity21 -- who died in january -- were interviewed by his investigators			1
the former defensive coordinator was convicted in june of sexually abusing 10 young boys over several years			1
he continues to maintain his innocence			0
in @entity2 's first interview since the scandal unfolded , he spoke with @entity47 magazine in an interview published wednesday			1
@entity2 reiterated his position about e-mails he is accused of exchanging with top university officials over two specific allegations of abuse involving @entity10 : one in 1998 and another in 2001			1
" i have no recollection " of the exchanges from the 1998 incident , he told @entity54 , a staff writer for @entity47 and @entity0 senior legal analyst			2
" i am aware , as i said in my letter to the board of trustees , that i was apparently copied on two e-mails			0
i did n't reply to them			0
the first e-mail that i saw did n't mention anybody 's name			0
it simply said something to the effect of ' the employee will be interviewed tomorrow , ' something like that , no name mentioned			0
then , about five weeks later , i think it was , i was copied on another e-mail that said , ' the interview has been completed , the investigation has been completed , nothing was found , @entity10 felt badly that the kid might have felt badly			2
' " @entity6 to host sex abuse conference @entity2 then said @entity22 and @entity79 came to him " with a heads - up " after the 2001 incident , in which @entity39 reported that he heard " rhythmic slapping sounds " coming from a university shower room and saw @entity10 directly behind a young boy			1
" they said we received a report that a member of the athletic department staff , after a workout in one of our athletic facilities , saw @entity10 in the locker room with one of his kids , meaning one of his @entity102 kids , " @entity2 said , referring to @entity10 's former foundation			1
" and it was reported that they were horsing around in the shower			0
now , they either used the word ' horsing around ' or ' horseplay			0
' and the staff member was n't sure what he saw , because it was indirect and around a corner			0
" the former president then said he recalls asking whether the administrators were " sure that 's how it was described to you , as ' horsing around ' ? " and the answer was yes from both @entity23 and @entity22 , " @entity2 recalled			2
" i remember , for a moment , sort of figuratively scratching our heads and thinking about what 's an appropriate way to follow up on ' horsing around			0
' i had never gotten a report like that before			2
" @entity2 then said that he decided @entity22 should speak with @entity10 " and explain to him that this is unacceptable to us			2
" @entity6 football loses star tailback to @entity130 " he was no longer an employee at the university ; he 'd been retired for three years			1
so we did n't have any hold over him in that way			0
but he was with the @entity102 , and we thought , we should tell the president of the @entity102 that we 're going to give @entity10 this directive , and we 'd like their support for that , and we do n't want any @entity102 kids being brought into the athletic shower facilities			0
" @entity22 and @entity79 still face felony perjury counts amid accusations of lying to a grand jury and failing to report suspected child abuse			2
they have pleaded not guilty			0
" as mr. @entity2 's lawyers said today , there is one thing about which there is no doubt : @entity22 did not tell dr. @entity2 that mr. @entity10 sexually abused a young boy in 2001 , " said @entity22 's attorney , @entity153			1
" and that is because @entity39 never told anyone , including @entity22 and @entity23 , that he witnessed mr. @entity10 sexually abusing a young boy in a @entity6 shower			1
" she said the truth will be determined at trial and not by the " baseless opinion of a so - called independent investigation			0
" @entity79 's attorney , @entity164 , said the @entity13 report was " inaccurate , incomplete and unfair			1
" @entity79 testified to a grand jury that @entity39 never told him that the assistant had witnessed sexual abuse , @entity164 reiterated			0
attorneys : @entity10 voice mails released @entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			2
