-- since the day i rocked my first pair of door - knocker hoop earrings and a baby blue velour @entity6 sweatsuit , @entity1 has been my guy			1
his swagger , his street cred gone corporate , his lyrical genius and his uncanny ability to tap into the ethos of my hip - hop generation through the decades have inspired millions from the @entity15 to bleakest corners of @entity17			1
we ca n't knock the hustle			0
we love @entity1 because he eloquently raps to the world the words we often want to say but keep tucked away behind our public faces			1
he 's been our voice for so long that many of us think it unfathomable that he finds himself tongue - tied and on the wrong side of a racial profiling case at @entity30 luxury retail store in @entity31 , after two @entity26 customers charged that they 'd been wrongly detained and harassed by police after making expensive purchases			1
for a while now , @entity1 has been planning a collaboration with @entity30 for an " exclusive " line of luxury items for the holidays			1
in his first statement on why he has n't gone along with calls to dump the deal , he said , " i move and speak based on facts and not emotion			1
" i am waiting on facts and the outcome of a meeting between community leaders and @entity30			1
why am i being demonized , denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately ? " he asked after his face was splashed across the @entity51			0
not exactly fighting words coming from the man who has spent decades demanding respect and railing against racism			2
this is the man who led a boycott of cristal sparkling wine and other products when he believed the companies were disrespecting the black dollar			0
@entity1 's partnership with @entity30 -- called " a @entity65 " -- was designed in collaboration with luxury fashion houses			1
the products range from a $ 70 t - shirt , the cheapest item in the line , to a $ 33,900 watch			0
reportedly , the deal may bring in millions , but a quarter of the profits will go to his @entity75 , which helps underprivileged young people get a college education			0
and for that reason alone , i say @entity1 should stay at the table with @entity30 and use his leverage to force a change in the retailer 's discriminatory security practices			1
it would n't be the first time " dirty money " was flipped and used for a better purpose			0
nearly everything @entity1 touches goes platinum , from street wear fashion lines like @entity6 to the new @entity92 ' sports arena			2
so it 's easy to understand how @entity30 , no longer a must - shop for serious fashionistas , would need @entity1 and the community that supports him to help return the retailer to relevance			1
@entity1 delivers dollars , especially african - american dollars			1
we 've helped him build a fashion empire and sell more than 50 million albums worldwide while receiving 17 @entity103			0
and when we saw him at @entity104 on the 2012 @entity106 list of hip - hop 's wealthiest artists with a net worth of nearly $ 500 million , we celebrated , because we knew his success was not possible without us			1
now , it 's time for him to give something back to the hip - hop nation that has made him a global brand			1
retailers have to be vigilant about theft : more than $ 13 billion worth of goods are stolen each year , more than $ 35 million a day , according to the @entity118 for @entity119			0
so what 's the " profile " of a shoplifter ? @entity124 studies show that 70 % of people arrested for shoplifting are white			0
in some regions of the country , two - thirds are white women			0
and experts on retail crime prevention say most theft is committed by the employees			0
the two @entity30 customers , @entity135 and @entity136 , said last week that they were racially profiled and detained by police after making expensive purchases			2
@entity139 sued @entity30 , saying he was accused of fraud after using his debit card to buy a $ 349 @entity144 belt in april			1
@entity145 filed a notice of claim saying she would sue after she was stopped by detectives outside the store when she bought a $ 2,500 @entity152 handbag in february			0
it 's nearly impossible to find a black person , including myself , who can say he or she has never been harassed while shopping			0
it happens so frequently that we 've accepted it as a normal part of life			0
it 's one reason why i 've never spent my hard - earned cash in places that make me feel unwelcomed			1
it 's just not worth the frustration of dealing with ignorant retail workers , especially in upscale department stores , who too many times show disdain for the very customers who make their jobs possible			1
for now , i 'm sticking with @entity1 and trusting that he 'll find a way to step up and lead a national dialogue about retail racial profiling			1
it 's a conversation that is long overdue			0
the trick with having power is learning how to wield it wisely			0
staying at the table and confronting @entity30 is a stronger position from which to negotiate change			2
and @entity1 , along with other community activists , is the right voice to further this conversation			2
as the criticism grew , @entity30 said thursday that it had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures			2
ceo @entity190 offered his " sincere regret and deepest apologies			0
" but beyond a review and apology , @entity30 and other retailers need to have a strong , clearly defined policies against racial profiling			1
if members of the security or sales staff are found guilty of this offense , they should be fired			0
all employees should be screened for racial biases when they are hired and be trained on how to respectfully serve the diverse customers who are keeping the doors open			0
because retailers like @entity30 need us a lot more than we 'll ever need them			2
racial profiling has been business as usual for too long			1
@entity1 has the power to bring change			2
and i 'm betting @entity17 's finest will rise to the occasion			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			2

luxury store @entity30 accused of racial profiling ; hip - hop icon @entity1 has deal with store
@entity217 : @entity1 , who has fought racism in his career , has ignored calls to dump the deal
@entity227 is on @entity1 's side ; he can make public the everyday damage of racial profiling in retail
@entity227 : all stores need strong policies against racial profiling and must fire staff who do it
