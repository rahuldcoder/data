-- this summer , @entity1 in @entity2 will be the venue for @entity5 volleyball , but last night @entity6 hired this vast space to launch a single product -- its new flagship phone , the @entity10 ( we really liked it incidentally , check out our hands - on preview here )			1
hiring such a large space and filling it full of tech heads from all over the world was a sign of extreme confidence from the @entity22 electronics giant , and you only have to take a look at its last set of figures to see where the bravado is coming from			2
net profit for the quarter was 5.05tn won , up 81 % , and the main driver for this success was @entity6 's @entity32 range of phones			1
the @entity32 range has certainly been selling like hot cakes			0
this week , trend - watchers @entity36 put the company ahead of the competition in its latest state of the market analysis			2
what 's interesting to me is how different @entity6 's strategy is to its other major smartphone competitor , @entity46			1
there is only one @entity49 released every year , and design-wise , each one has been broadly the same as the previous model , with the same size screen			0

this might seem like a recipe for confusion , but it also means that that @entity6 has a phone to suit pretty much every potential customer			1
want something pocketable that 's cheap ? there 's a @entity32 for that			0
need lots of power , a massive screen and a stylus to draw pictures with ? @entity32 can help			0
@entity46 is fantastic at making a product that 's very aspirational , and it makes an enormous amount of money on every @entity49 , but in terms of simply shifting a lot of phones and achieving huge scale , it 's @entity6 that has the winning strategy			1
both @entity46 and @entity6 are so successful in fact , the battle for the top smartphone slot is starting to look like a two - horse race			1
but it wo n't necessarily always be this way			0
@entity88 was the darling of the mobile industry a while back until @entity6 arrived to eat its lunch			2
the transformation in the company 's fortunes was rapid , and there 's every possibility that @entity6 could see an equally rapid turnaround at some point in the future -- in mobiles , you 're only as good as your last hit product			1
there 's also a chance that @entity6 's scale could turn out to be a weakness as well as a strength			1
in some respects , @entity6 reminds me of @entity110 in the years before it all went wrong			1
there are lots of divisions that do n't appear to communicate with each other very well , making a vast number of different products , most of which are decent , but not outstanding			0
read more : new @entity6 ' not for everyone ' there 's a desire to be the number one player in every category @entity6 is in , which is laudable , but probably unachievable			1
does @entity6 really need to be the number one maker of cameras in the world ? or mp3 players ? probably not			2
i ca n't help but wonder whether its smartphone profits are covering up some deeper organizational problems			0
then again , it seems to be working for now , so it may all turn out fine			0
if a company was to snatch the smartphone crown from @entity6 , which would it be ? one answer might be @entity140 , which may seem like a crazy thing to say following its latest set of disastrous financial results			1
but there is still a chance that it might not be game over			0
@entity140 's flagship mobile running @entity149 's @entity148 , the @entity150 900 , has recently appeared in @entity151 to decent critical acclaim			0
in the @entity151 , @entity153 does n't have quite the same grip on the market that it does in the @entity157 in particular , so there 's an outside chance @entity140 could sell enough handsets to convince developers deal with the platform 's biggest problem -- a lack of apps			0
if that happens , the launch of @entity167 could open the whole field up again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity172 : @entity6 's strategy different to its main rival , @entity46
the @entity22 company has a phone to suit pretty much every potential customer
but @entity6 's scale could turn out to be a weakness as well as a strength , says @entity172
