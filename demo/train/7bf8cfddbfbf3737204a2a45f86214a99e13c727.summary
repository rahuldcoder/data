@entity4 when it comes to access to their favorite shows , millions of @entity1 fans of @entity3 tv series find the plot thickening as 2014 draws to a close			1
in late november , many found their entertainment lifeline cut off as authorities shut down two of the country 's most popular file - sharing sites -- one with countless episodes of @entity3 tv series , and the other with meticulously translated @entity1 subtitles for those shows			1
state media called the sites known copyright infringers			0
the sites themselves claimed to be free platforms for people who want to learn about @entity3 language and culture -- not money - making ventures			1
worse still , fans quickly realized their only viable alternative -- @entity1 's legitimate video streaming sites -- may soon fall victim to the censors ' tightening grip			1
fleeting optimism almost no current @entity3 tv series air on @entity1 's broadcast and cable networks			1
in february , viewers and critics hailed the release of hit political thriller " @entity52 " on video site @entity45 at the same time it aired on @entity48 in the @entity3 as a sign of liberalization in @entity1 's strictly - controlled media market			1
many @entity45 users binge - watched all 13 episodes of the second season , which appeared uncensored despite unflattering story lines about @entity1 's ruling @entity58 elite			2
it had clocked more than 103 million views by mid-december , more than double @entity48 's 50 million global subscribers			0
but the sense of optimism among fans quickly dissipated when in april , without warning , the government banned four popular @entity3 tv series -- including the top - rated sitcom " @entity70 " -- on all streaming sites			1
officials cited violations of copyrights laws and content regulations without giving specifics , even though the shows had been purchased and allowed to stream online for several seasons			0
stockpiling shows fans are bracing for more disappointment			1
@entity1 's broadcast regulator has strongly hinted from april 2015 it would only approve " healthy " content to be streamed online -- a troubling prospect for followers of such shows as zombie horror drama " @entity89 " and steamy period drama " @entity88			1
" what 's more , online broadcasters may have to wait for a show 's entire season to air in the @entity3 before streaming it in @entity1			1
hardcore followers say they dread the prospect of having to wait to watch chopped versions of their beloved shows on streaming sites			0
many young , urban and well - educated fans insist , given the rising government restrictions , only illicit file - sharing services offer the quick and unfettered access they crave			1
" i 've been stockpiling shows by downloading as much as possible -- it 's the only way to make me feel safe , " explained @entity106 , 30 , a @entity4 lawyer who considers watching @entity3 legal dramas like " @entity108 " -- one of the four shows banned in april -- on his @entity110 in the gym a daily highlight			2
" i understand copyright concerns , but the policy just seems arbitrary , " said @entity115 , 23 , a social work graduate student in the @entity1 capital who breathlessly lists more than a dozen @entity3 tv shows that she regularly watches			1
ideological threat ? what alarms censors , fans and analysts argue , is the immense popularity of those shows -- with a new episode often attracting millions of views or downloads within hours			0
" the following used to be small -- but now it 's gotten so huge that officials become nervous about the impact and feel compelled to do something about it , " said @entity130 , 32 , a @entity4 - based corporate publicist who compares watching @entity3 tv series to getting a cup of @entity134 coffee -- another of her addictions			1
@entity141 , a leading commentator on @entity1 's media landscape , said it was surprising how @entity3 tv series posted on @entity1 video sites had been allowed to proliferate with very little government interference			1
" they are now putting these measures in place to make sure it does n't become an ideological threat , " he said			0
" this helps them better micromanage the content and frighten @entity155 companies into complying with regulations			0
" even shows that manage to get into @entity1 sometimes disappear			2
" madam secretary , " a new political drama that debuted this past autumn , is widely streamed online in @entity1			0
nowhere to be found , however , is its fourth episode , which features some of @entity1 's taboo subjects : the @entity164 crackdown , the one - child policy , and a territorial dispute between @entity1 and @entity167			2
people will wearily accept the " new normal " of rising censorship under an increasingly powerful and hardline president @entity169 , predicts @entity141			0
" anybody associated with thought work or ideology or the image of @entity1 -- everything is being squeezed or tightened or limited , " he said			0
new normal @entity141 also said the new rules have a commercial rationale			0
" they do n't want people to get too hooked on foreign shows and not to watch any @entity1 content			2
" @entity182 , the president of @entity183 , a major entertainment company based in @entity184 , told @entity5 that the new policies help domestic tv producers like her			0
" we 'll have plenty more high - quality original programming to conquer not just the @entity1 but the global market			2
" fans of @entity191 are not so sure			0
for now , many try to explore technical workarounds to new government restrictions and insist that , no matter what happens , they wo n't watch domestic shows known for their over-the - top propaganda and low production values			0
" if they totally shut the door to @entity191 , it would be tragic , " said @entity130 , the corporate publicist who equates her desire for @entity3 shows to that for caffeine			2
" it would be just tragic if you could n't even choose your own entertainment			0
