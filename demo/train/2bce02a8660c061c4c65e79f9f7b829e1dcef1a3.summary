on february 1 , deadly riots at a football match in @entity2 plunged @entity3 into mourning and despair			1
the national league was canceled and the future of one of @entity11 soccer 's traditional powerhouses seemed bleak			0
however , a tiny bit of that gloom lifted just weeks later when @entity14 made history by making his 179th international appearance -- a new world record that gave a glimmer of hope in a time of turmoil			2
but , as he prepares to continue the @entity23 ' rebuilding phase , @entity14 says that @entity3 -- a country where sport and politics are inextricably linked -- faces a long road to recovery before it can resolve its problems and move out of a " dark tunnel			1
" " the whole country is suffering from a lack of ethics , as well as a general lack of security , and this is causing problems in all facets of life , " the 36 - year - old told the official website of world football 's governing body @entity32			1
" there is no doubt that football will bounce back but the whole country has to make it out of this dark tunnel			0
stability will only return when all members of the community , whether they be players , fans , referees , journalists or security staff , recognize their role , stick to it and respect the role of others			0
" @entity58 is coach , protester in @entity3 @entity14 's landmark appearance came on february 27 in a friendly against @entity63 in @entity64			1
the @entity3 team has not been able to play at home since the riots , which killed 74 people after a game between top - tier clubs @entity71 and @entity72			1
more lives were lost as fighting spread across the country			0
@entity14 , who has returned to the national squad for thursday 's friendly against @entity77 in @entity78 , was deeply moved by the tragedy			1
an outspoken figure against football hooliganism , @entity14 took to the streets the following day in protest against the clashes			2
" it 's depressing to see the sport that everybody loves become a source of such sadness but , ultimately , what happened was a result of fanaticism , " he said			0
" i have to say that the media also played a large role by stirring up the fans ' aggression instead of attempting to calm things down			0
" @entity14 captained @entity3 to @entity99 titles in 2006 , 2008 and 2010 -- his fourth overall			1
but the @entity23 ' form has plummeted in recent years , failing to qualify for the 2012 edition of the tournament			2
@entity14 said the @entity105 uprising last year , which saw @entity3 president @entity106 overthrown in a wave of protest , was a factor in the team 's fall in fortunes			1
" we 're all part of this country and anything that goes on affects us , so naturally our concentration levels drop and we can not remain focused when such turmoil is happening at home			0
on top of that there 's the fact that we could n't play for a very long time with the league being suspended for almost four months , " he said			0
@entity14 said @entity3 had taken for granted its ability to qualify			1
" after being on top for all those years , we simply underestimated our opponents , but we have learned our lesson well and we have learned it the hard way			0
" @entity14 carved a successful football career in @entity132 for 10 years , before returning in 2008 to play for @entity72 and , now , that club 's fiercest rival @entity135			1
both teams , like @entity71 , are supported by militant fan groups known as " ultras			0
" " it is a great thing if they stick to supporting their teams within the reasonable and ethical limits , but once it crosses the line and turns aggressive or becomes a vehicle for something completely beyond football then it becomes unacceptable and can lead to disasters , " @entity14 said			2
" all over the world , ultras support their clubs using organized cheering which can be very entertaining , and this is what we as players like to see in the stands , but if they cause violence in the stadiums then no , we can not tolerate that			2

most - capped player in history , @entity14 , says @entity3 is suffering from a lack of ethics
former @entity3 captain *blames* " *over-confidence* " for team 's failure to qualify for 2012 @entity99
he was deeply moved by the fatal football riots in @entity2 on february 1
@entity14 says the activities of " ultras " can cause problems in the stadiums
