-- imagine going in for a cancer screening , and the technician turns to you and says , " we 're finished , but if i push this button over here , the machine can detect even smaller cancers			0
but here 's the hitch : you have to pay $ 700 if you want me to push this button			1
" " you 'd be enraged , " says @entity11 , director of cancer genetic counseling at @entity12			0
" you 'd want to know why you have to pay extra to push that button			0
why did n't they just do it right the first time ? " doctors and genetic counselors interviewed by @entity0 say that @entity19 in @entity20 is doing something very similar with tests that determine if a woman has a potentially dangerous genetic abnormality linked to breast cancers			1
most breast cancers do not seem to be genetic			0
instead , they 're the result of cells gone wild for no apparent reason			0
however , some women get breast cancer because a bad gene runs in their families			1
when testing shows that a woman carries such a gene , she has a much higher chance of getting breast cancer			1
these women usually then get more frequent @entity42 , ultrasounds and mammograms to detect a cancer , and sometimes even choose to remove their breasts to prevent a cancer from growing in the first place			0
@entity19 owns the patent on breast cancer genes and so is the only company that can test for them			1
it offers one test that catches most , but not all , abnormalities , and then charges nearly all patients $ 700 for a second test that catches the rest			1
if a woman ca n't afford the $ 700 fee , she may miss an abnormality , which could mean the difference between life and death			1
" what @entity19 's doing -- charging extra for this test -- is really sleazy , " @entity11 says			1
" they 're collecting blood money off my patients			0
" @entity19 defends the $ 700 charge for its second test , called @entity73 , even though many patients ca n't afford it and insurance wo n't pay for it			1
" the @entity73 test is based on different and separate technology , " @entity76 , a @entity19 spokeswoman , wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" [ it 's ] based on a sophisticated new technology developed exclusively by @entity19			1
" she added that @entity19 is trying to persuade insurance companies to pay for the test and that it offers financial assistance to patients who meet certain criteria , and monthly interest - free payments to those why do owe the $ 700 fee			1
" @entity19 's mission is to improve the patient 's quality of life and to save lives , " she added in the e-mail			2
understanding the furor to understand the anger and bitterness that patients , doctors and genetic counselors harbor toward @entity19 , it 's important to know the basics of genetic testing			2
in 1996 , @entity19 offered its first test for breast cancer genetic abnormalities			1
known as the @entity109 test , it 's been revolutionary and has saved countless lives : if the test reveals that a woman has a genetic abnormality , it means she has a very high chance of getting breast cancer in the future , and some women then opt to remove their breasts as a pre-emptive strike against cancer			1
women who test positive for brca also sometimes opt to have their ovaries removed , since having a breast cancer gene abnormality gives them a higher - than - normal chance of getting ovarian cancer as well			1
" genetic testing has been a godsend for so many women , " @entity11 says			0
@entity19 calls its test the @entity130 , but it soon became clear that it was n't truly comprehensive			1
it did not catch all genetic abnormalities linked to cancer , and so in 2006 , the company began selling @entity73 , the newer test that catches genetic defects that the original test misses			1
doctors and counselors expected @entity19 to offer @entity73 as part of its original test , but instead the company offers it separately and charges nearly everyone $ 700 to take it			1
" this is so irresponsible of @entity19 , " says @entity142 , director of genetic counseling at @entity143 in @entity144			2
she and other genetic counselors have been fighting to get @entity19 to stop the $ 700 charge			1
they say they worry that women who tested negative under the first test feel assured that they do n't have a bad gene when in fact they might , and would n't know they 're at increased risk for getting breast cancer			1
@entity155 and other genetic counselors say that when @entity19 came up with an improvement in its colon cancer test , it wrapped it into its original screening at one price			1
the counselors say they think @entity19 handled the breast cancer test differently , charging a separate fee , because it has no competition			1
" from a business perspective , i guess i understand why @entity19 is doing what they 're doing , because this is a good chunk of money for them , " says @entity166 , the senior genetic counselor at the @entity167			2
" but i feel really strongly that @entity19 is doing the wrong thing			2
" " that accusation is incorrect , " @entity76 wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" i 'm so angry " for @entity178 and @entity179 , money was n't the issue			0
the two sisters were stunned three years ago when @entity178 was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40			1
they breathed a sigh of relief when @entity178 tested negative for the brca gene using @entity19 's original test			2
this meant @entity178 's cancer was a fluke , and not something her sister or other relatives needed to worry about			0
then two years later , at the age of 47 , @entity179 found out she had ovarian cancer			0
surgeons removed her ovaries and found the cancer had spread to her abdomen			0
after chemotherapy , the cancer came back a year later			0
" i told my surgeon my sister had genetic testing , but it came back negative , " @entity179 says			0
" my surgeon just hung her head down and shook it back and forth			0
i was like , ' what ? how weird is that ? ' " the surgeon told @entity179 that her sister 's test might have been incomplete			0
she instructed @entity212 to ask her sister , who lives in @entity144 , to find out if she 'd received the second test , @entity73 , in addition to the original breast cancer genetic test			1
@entity178 found out she had not had not received @entity73			2
she went back to @entity143 to have it done , and the test was positive			0
@entity179 and her father then had @entity73 , and it turns out that they , too , carry a genetic abnormality			2
women who have genetic abnormalities like @entity223 's have a 50 % to 85 % chance of getting breast cancer , and a 10 % to 40 % chance of getting ovarian cancer			1
she says that if her sister had had @entity73 from the beginning , she also would have taken the test , and the positive result would have made her remove her breasts and ovaries " in a minute			2
" " if @entity73 had been done from the beginning , it could have saved @entity179 from getting ovarian cancer , " says dr. @entity233 , @entity179 's surgeon at the @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity236			2
" it could have prevented my cancer , or at least caught it early , " @entity179 adds			0
" now my cancer is so advanced , i have only a 20 % chance of being alive five years from now			0
" @entity155 , the genetic counselor at @entity143 , says she never mentioned @entity73 to @entity178 , nor to most of the women who came in for testing at that time			2
she says information from @entity19 led her to believe that @entity73 mutations were extremely rare among women like @entity178 without an extremely strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer			1
when some women do have a very strong family history , @entity19 will do a @entity73 analysis for free as part of its original test , and has spent $ 20 million on these tests			1
" we were left with the impression that @entity73 was n't necessary for families like @entity178 's , " @entity155 says			2
" it just did n't seem urgent			0
" but over time , it 's become clear that @entity19 might have been wrong about who needs @entity73 testing , counselors say			1
several studies , such as one done by @entity166 at the @entity167 , show that a substantial number of women had @entity73 mutations even without a very strong family history			2
now , @entity155 and others offer @entity73 to all their patients , but many ca n't do it because of the cost			2
" this is all really frustrating , " @entity155 says			0
" we know we 're missing women out there with @entity73 mutations because they ca n't afford to pay			2
if you miss just one @entity73 mutation , that woman could be in danger , and so could her mother , her sisters and her other relatives			2
" " it 's heartbreaking , " says @entity282 , @entity223 's genetic counselor at the @entity234			0
" it 's so sad that now @entity179 is fighting for her life when something could have been done to avoid it			0
" @entity76 , the @entity19 spokeswoman , says studies show " less than one percent of all women tested " have a @entity73 mutation			1
what to do when you get breast cancer genetic testing if you 're about to get breast cancer genetic testing , specifically ask if you 'll receive @entity73 testing			1
if you 've had breast cancer genetic testing , do n't assume you received the @entity73 test			1
also , do n't assume that the place where you had the testing will get back in touch with you to let you know about @entity73			0
@entity0 contacted four genetic testing centers , each of which did something different : one center quickly contacted all patients to tell them about @entity73 ; another contacted only patients they considered high risk ; the third contacted patients three years after @entity73 became available ; and the fourth still has n't contacted patients to tell them about @entity73			0
genetic counselors recommend that you call the place where you had testing every year or so to see if there have been any improvements in the test			0
most women will have to decide whether they want to spend $ 700 to get @entity73 testing			1
@entity178 wishes she 'd had the opportunity to spend that money			0
" i 'm so mad at @entity19			0
it 's even hard just to talk about it , " @entity178 says , starting to cry			0
" a test could have put the information in our hands that could have prevented my sister 's cancer			0
it 's frustrating and really hard to comprehend			0
" @entity333 contributed to this report .			0
