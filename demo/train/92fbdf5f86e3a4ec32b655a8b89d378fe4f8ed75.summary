-- @entity1 considers herself an amateur genealogist , spending hours online searching for information about family members she never knew			2
among them : @entity1 's great - great - grandmother @entity7 , who died in the @entity9			1
the circumstances surrounding her death are still murky			0
" they were living in this town called @entity17 , which is currently in @entity19 , and when the @entity20 were coming , some of her children and her grandchildren said , ' ok , we 're going to leave			0
we 're going to go with the @entity23 army			0
' and she said , ' i 'm too old			0
i 'm going to stay behind			0
' and that was the last they saw of her			0
" through her research , @entity1 determined that her great - great - grandmother was probably killed in that town , like other elderly people , rather than transported by the @entity33 to the @entity35 extermination camp			0
she is still looking for information about other family members			0
@entity1 has also embarked on another project , one that will help others -- strangers -- find clues about what happened to their loved ones in the @entity9			1
" i just think that it 's really important to keep the memory of these people who died alive			2
i 've heard stories so many times where they said , ' we had survivors who are our relatives , and they just did n't want to talk about it			0
we just do n't know what happened			0
' " @entity1 is one of more than 2,100 volunteers around the world who have signed on to the @entity56 , a joint effort by the @entity58 and @entity59 , a family research website , to create the world 's largest online searchable database of records related to victims of the @entity9			1
it 's a massive undertaking : the museum has more than 170 million documents about victims of @entity70 persecution , including @entity70 concentration camp records and transport lists , records created by @entity75 communities and @entity77 government documents about people displaced by the war who later emigrated to the @entity77			1
the project , which began in may , recruits volunteers like @entity1 to put names and other key words from the documents into an online database , which is then searchable by anyone in the world			1
the first data sets became searchable this month			2
once people locate information online about family members , they can request copies of the full documents from the museum			2
the service is free and will remain so permanently			0
volunteers have added more than 765,000 records to the database in the six months since the project began , and the number goes up everyday			1
compare that with the process before the project 's launch , when a museum intern indexed the records and managed to complete about 1,000 records a month			1
speed is a key part of the @entity56			1
" clearly , we 're in a race against time to help survivors find out what happened to their loved ones before it 's too late , " said @entity112 , director of the project			1
it allows survivors and family members who are unable to travel to the museum in @entity124 to access the information from the comfort of their own homes , said @entity129 , director of @entity59 's content acquisition			1
and for anyone who wants to contribute to the project , they can do so from anywhere in the world			1
" you can do it at 2 o'clock in the morning in your pajamas , " @entity129 explained , just by going to worldmemoryproject.org and following the steps to download the software , which was developed by @entity59			0
no special skills are required , no computer or language expertise , he said			0
to ensure accuracy , two volunteers index each document			2
their work is reviewed by a third , more experienced arbitrator , who resolves any discrepancies			0
both @entity129 and @entity112 describe the response to the project as overwhelming			2
volunteers include those as young as 12 , with help from their parents , as well as some @entity9 survivors who are in their 70s and 80s			1
" this project is about restoring the identities of the victims , the people who the @entity33 tried to erase			2
they -- the @entity33 -- gave them numbers , and we are giving them back their names , and the public can help us do this , " @entity112 said .			1
