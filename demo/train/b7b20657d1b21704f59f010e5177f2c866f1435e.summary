-- a manufacturer of military - style rifles says it is leaving @entity3 and is encouraging other companies to do the same after last week 's signing of sweeping gun legislation			1
@entity7 of @entity8 said the bill approved by the @entity10 was " fraught with ambiguous definitions , insufficient considerations for the trade , conflicting mandates and disastrous consequences for the fundamental rights of the people of @entity3			1
" in a statement , the company said it hopes to pick a site by summer and move by the end of the year			0
gov. @entity22 on thursday signed what advocacy groups call the strongest and most comprehensive gun legislation in the nation			1
compromise sets up likely @entity29 debate the law bans some weapons as well as the sale or purchase of high - capacity magazines like those used in the @entity36 , @entity3 , shooting in december that left 20 children and six adults dead			1
it also requires background checks for all gun purchases			0
the @entity3 measure adds more than 100 guns to the state 's list of banned assault weapons , limits the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 rounds and bans armor - piercing bullets			2
@entity3 governor signs sweeping gun measure while the new law allows current owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds to keep them , it requires those people to register the magazines with the state and forbids owners from loading them with more than 10 rounds outside their homes or while at a gun range			1
" at any given time , we own 100,000 or more 20 - round magazines , " @entity7 ceo @entity65 told @entity0 affiliate @entity66			2
" how are we supposed to individually register all of those magazines ? " no more gun sales where semiautomatic used in @entity73 shooting with the restrictions and loss of sales , @entity65 said , his company will be unable to make payroll			0
@entity80 , vice president of sales , said @entity7 has 42 employees			2
" indirectly , we employ 15 to 20 local vendors at any given time who have up to 15 to 30 employees each , " he told @entity0 on wednesday			0
all of the company 's rifles are semiautomatic			0
@entity7 sells its products to national distributors , and they are resold to federally licensed retailers across the country , said @entity80			2
@entity80 said he did not have data on current sales in @entity3 , but he said the law makes the company 's rifles illegal for sale or transfer within the state			1
" our governor has decided that he wants our business to stay here and sell the guns he feels deemed illegal to other states , but not our own , " said @entity80			0
" we do not agree with that logic			0
" why is passing new gun control legislation so hard ? critics have argued the @entity3 legislation will do nothing to stop someone like @entity112 , who carried out the @entity73 school killings december 14 with an assault - style weapon and high - capacity magazines			1
" in his case , he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage , " @entity117 , president of the @entity118 , previously has said			0
" limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law - abiding persons , not criminals bent on murder			0
" @entity132 @entity131 minority leader @entity130 , a member of the bipartisan task force that drafted the bill , reassured gun owners they would n't lose their guns or ammunition magazines , " so long as they follow our rules and register , " he said			2
on thursday , when he signed the gun law , @entity145 said , " we have come together in a way that relatively few places in our nation have demonstrated an ability to do			2
" however , he noted , " today does not mark the end of our efforts " to combat gun violence			1
president @entity149 has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws			0
background checks on gun sales : how do they work ? @entity7 said the safety of children was " at best questionably improved " since the shootings			1
" due to an improperly drafted bill , manufacturing of modern sporting rifles in the @entity165 has been effectively outlawed , " the company said in tuesday 's statement , adding it made the decision with " heavy heart			1
" @entity7 called on other gunmakers to leave @entity3 and " show our politicians the true consequences of their hasty and uninformed actions			1
" in february , @entity171 house speaker @entity170 invited gunmakers such as @entity173 to relocate to his state from @entity3 and elsewhere			0
@entity173 is based in @entity175			0
the gun industry in @entity3 is being attacked and " demonized " because of national politics , @entity170 said in a letter to @entity173 's ceo before the gun law 's passage			1
@entity183 sen. @entity182 , a @entity3 @entity184 , said @entity170 sent letters to three gunmakers in his state and called @entity170 's proposal " preposterous			0
" @entity3 residents support the @entity189 and responsible gun ownership , " far from demonizing firearms products made here , " @entity182 said in a statement			1
before the play date , the gun talk parents defend rights to keep guns in the home			0
