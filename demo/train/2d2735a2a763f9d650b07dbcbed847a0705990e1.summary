no other funeral arrangements were yet known			0
no autopsy is expected since @entity0 died under a doctor 's care in a hospital			1
the immediate cause of death was from sepsis caused by an ulcerated bedsore , the family member said			0
@entity0 's family feud in may , a @entity54 judge awarded @entity8 temporary power of attorney after @entity69 took her husband out of a nursing home and moved him to @entity11 amid family feuding			1
a @entity11 judge later allowed @entity8 to visit her father in that state			0
@entity0 was hospitalized after an argument between @entity41 and @entity8 in which his wife threw meat at her stepdaughter			1
last week , a @entity80 judge gave daughter @entity8 the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water , food and medicine			0
@entity0 was already a popular disc jockey in @entity80 when he became the host of " @entity4 " in 1970			1
the syndicated show , which counted down the 40 most popular songs in the @entity90 based on @entity93 's @entity92 music chart , began on just seven radio stations but quickly became a mainstay of thousands , all around the world			2
" when we first went on the air , i thought we would be around for at least 20 years			0
i knew the formula worked			0
i knew people tuned in to find out what the no. 1 record was , " he told @entity101 in 1989			0
@entity0 's first no. 1 , concluding the " @entity4 " premiere show of july 4 , 1970 , was @entity107 's " @entity108 ( not to come )			1
" his last on successor show " @entity4 , " almost exactly 39 years later , was " @entity110 " by @entity111			2
but the show was n't just about finding out who was no. 1			0
its features , included biographical details on performs , flashbacks , album cuts and @entity0 's " long - distance dedication " for listeners who wrote to dedicate songs to friends and loved ones far away			1
@entity0 , whose baritone was always friendly and upbeat , delivered these in his most sympathetic voice , warm enough to melt butter			1
" @entity134 , " he began , and would read an emotional letter from a listener who wanted to connect with an old flame , express regret to a new love or send wishes to a far - flung family member			0
the first one , for example , was from a male listener who wanted to dedicate @entity141 's " @entity139 " to a sweetheart named @entity139 who was moving to @entity140			0
the show , originally three hours , expanded to four in the late ' 70s			0
tributes : ' keep reaching for the stars ' in many ways , even as @entity145 moved from the @entity146 to the @entity148 dial and took on the name " @entity145 , " " @entity4 " remained a throwback to the way the format was in the 1960s , with frequent number jingles ( " @entity156 ! " ) and a fast - moving mix , though @entity0 , in temperament , practically defined the laid - back hosts of the @entity159			1
( the exception to the laid - back rule was a much - copied outtake , now readily available on the @entity163 , of @entity0 exploding in anger over a long - distance dedication that succeeded an up - tempo record			2
) the show inspired several imitators , including a television version , " @entity171 , " hosted by @entity0 himself			2
@entity0 left " @entity4 " in 1988 over a contract dispute with @entity173 and signed with competitor @entity174 , for whom he started a show called " @entity5 " in 1989			1
the new show used a different publication 's chart , but it was the same old @entity0 : smooth , cheerful , full of information			1
" the magic of @entity0 is that he is the ultimate professional in whatever he does			2
... he enlightens , he explores , he suggests , he provokes and he informs , " fellow dj @entity184 told @entity93 in 1997			0
@entity0 acquired the name " @entity4 " and in 1998 resumed hosting the program with a new syndicator			1
( the @entity173 show , with @entity188 replacing @entity0 , had been canceled in 1995			2
) he handed off to @entity189 in 2004 , though he continued with two other shows , " @entity4 " and " @entity4 , " until signing off in 2009 -- as always with his trademark line , " keep your feet on the ground , and keep reaching for the stars			2
" @entity0 was born in @entity196 in 1932			1
he first tried radio while in high school but found he had a talent for it while serving in @entity201 with the @entity202			2
he was a dj on the @entity203			0
@entity0 's global reach : long - distance dedications after stops in several cities , including @entity208 , @entity209 ; @entity211 , @entity212 ; and @entity213 , he joined @entity214 in @entity80 in 1963 , partly in hopes of an acting career			1
he did earn roles in a number of low - budget movies -- the most famous of which was probably " @entity231 " ( 1971 ) -- but his voice was always his ticket to fame , whether appearing on a @entity225 - produced tv show , " @entity226 , " or voicing the character of @entity228 on the cartoon " @entity230 , " which premiered in 1969			0
( he also was the voice of @entity232 on " @entity233			0
" ) that voice became ubiquitous			0
he was @entity236 's promotional announcer in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , and heard on dozens of commercials			0
but " @entity4 " remains his legacy			2
" @entity0 started the show in 1970 , a curious time to start a show about top 40 mainstream pop , because the format had just been pronounced dead and progressive album - oriented radio was on the rise , " wrote @entity239 in a 1990 @entity241 profile			1
" he infused the show with corny reverence for conventional @entity90 values exactly when cynicism had become the more fashionable posture			0
" @entity0 attributed his success to that everyday voice			2
" it 's not a clear - toned announcer 's voice , " he told the @entity257			2
" it 's more like the voice of the guy next door			0
'' @entity0 is survived by his second wife , @entity41 , whom he married in 1985 ; and four children			0
all - time great @entity267 people we 've lost in 2014			0

@entity0 had a progressive dementia , had been hospitalized for weeks
he began " @entity4 " in 1970 , was known for his friendly baritone voice
he was born @entity0 and became a dj while in the @entity202
' we are heartbroken , " @entity0 's daughter says in announcing his death sunday
