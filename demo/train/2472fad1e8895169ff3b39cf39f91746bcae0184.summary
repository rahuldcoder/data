a judge on friday ruled against @entity1 , dismissing its claims " in their entirety " against the federal government over its enforcement of immigration laws			1
the ruling by @entity11 district judge @entity10 is an apparent blow to @entity1 gov. @entity13 and her allies , who last year passed a controversial law known as @entity16			1
the @entity18 administration has challenged @entity1 , claiming that enforcing immigration matters is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government			2
and in a separate ruling in july 2010 , @entity22 blocked four key elements of the state legislation from taking effect -- including one requiring local police officers to check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws			0
this past august , state officials filed a petition to overturn that ruling , with @entity34 saying she wants the @entity11 @entity36 to decide the matter			1
@entity1 has argued that the law aims to merely assist and cooperate with federal authorities , which it says @entity41 has blessed			2
the focus of friday 's ruling was @entity1 's counterclaim to a federal lawsuit intent on blocking @entity16			1
@entity34 released a statement friday calling @entity22 's latest decision " to dismiss @entity1 's suit against the federal government ... frustrating but not entirely surprising			1
" " it is but the latest chapter in a story that @entity53 know all too well : the federal government ignores its constitutional and statutory duty to secure the border			0
federal courts avert their eyes			0
@entity11 citizens pay the price , " the statement said			0
passed last year , the @entity1 law aimed to " discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the @entity11			1
" in its counterclaims to the federal lawsuit , @entity1 stated that @entity70 does not have " operational control " over the @entity1 - @entity73 border , fails to protect @entity53 from invasion and domestic violence and has n't lived up to its statutory responsibility to enforce immigration laws			2
@entity1 also cited the 10th amendment , which states that powers not delegated to federal authorities rest with the states			0
but @entity22 wrote in her ruling that the " invasion clause protects against ' armed hostility from another political entity ' and does not permit @entity1 to sue the federal government for its alleged failure to protect the state from unlawful immigration			2
" @entity22 also said it is up to the political branch , not the courts , to decide if the " domestic violence clause " applies to the immigration debate			0
@entity1 also argued that it faces greater costs due to what it calls federal authorities failure to properly address immigration -- including to " provide education , medical care and other benefits " to illegal immigrants in violation of the @entity78			0
" the judge countered , claiming " @entity1 does not point to any federal immigration policy that mandates or compels @entity1 to take action			1
" " the complained of expenditures arise entirely from @entity1 's own policy choices and independent constitutional obligations and are not incurred as a result of any federal mandate			1
these state costs do not give rise to a claim under the @entity78 , " she wrote			0
@entity1 also alleged that the federal government " failed to comply with and enforce federal immigration law , " including a requirement that the @entity11 homeland security department have " operational control " of the border and construct at least 700 miles of barriers			1
the judge found that these laws do n't require " any discreet action ' with the clarity necessary to support judicial action , ' " noting that the term " operational control " is broad and that there are no deadlines for the fencing , infrastructure or other developments			0
in her statement following @entity22 's ruling , @entity34 vowed that the state 's efforts on the matters would continue			0
" this decision makes it even more critical that the @entity11 @entity36 hear our defense of @entity16 , " she said			1
" if the courts wo n't hold the federal government accountable -- as today 's decision makes clear -- then states like @entity1 need clarity in terms of the authority they have to combat illegal immigration			2

the judge rules that @entity1 's claims on immigration are without merit
@entity1 's governor vows to take fight to the @entity11 @entity36
@entity1 passed a controversial immigration law last year , *triggering* lawsuits
