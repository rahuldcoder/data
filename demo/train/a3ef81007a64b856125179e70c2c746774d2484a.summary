@entity0 -- @entity2 is a stalemated cesspool of government shutdown showdowns that could come straight from an @entity6 tv series			1
but on the issue of using military force in @entity10 , bipartisanship is coming from unexpected places			1
@entity13 members of @entity2 are joining forces with some of the most conservative to rein in the president			1
for instance , two lawmakers who legislate from complete opposite ends of the political spectrum are calling for the president to back down from a possible military strike			1
" the president 's line in the sand may have been a strategic blunder			1
but it is not enough reason to go to war , " sen. @entity26 , @entity27 , said in an opinion piece on @entity1 on friday , referring to president @entity30 's declaration that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable			2
rep. @entity36 , @entity37 , was even stronger in his opposition			2
" we are not the world 's policemen			2
that is not our responsibility , " he said thursday on @entity1 's " the lead			2
" while @entity36 and @entity26 are urging the president to take a step back from deploying the @entity51 military , a large number of @entity46 and @entity47 have joined together to demand that he allow @entity2 to have a say on @entity51 involvement			1
it 's a message almost identical regardless of political party			2
@entity51 to release information on @entity10 chemical weapon use said one lawmaker : " ( @entity59 ) he president has the responsibility to seek authorization from our nation 's elected leaders before initiating military action			1
" and another : " for too long , the legislature 's responsibility to authorize military force has been overlooked			2
" the first statement was made by liberal @entity72 @entity51 rep. @entity71 of @entity73 , and the second by @entity51 rep. @entity75 of @entity76 , a @entity46			2
more than 100 members of @entity2 , mostly conservative @entity46 but nearly two dozen @entity47 as well , have signed on to a letter to the president urging that he " consult and receive authorization from @entity2 before ordering the use of @entity51 military force in @entity10			1
" how much say will @entity2 have on @entity10 strike ? while partisanship has kept @entity2 from agreeing on the budget , gun control , and immigration , lawmakers have been able to find commonality on the issue of war			1
" those decisions are very tough decisions , and you 'll find some strange bedfellows , " said @entity94 , a former @entity46 congresswoman from @entity95 who was one of seven @entity46 and 147 @entity47 who voted against the use of military force in @entity98 in 2002			2
analysts tell @entity1 that uncommon alliances have become more common in recent years			2
" we used to have this model that bipartisan was when the center - right and the center - left compromised each other , " said @entity106 , executive director of the @entity107			1
" now it works when legislators vote because it makes ( them ) more conservative ... or more liberal			0
" the coalition of the right and the left has especially been evident over the issue of war			1
the last decade has left many lawmakers full of skepticism when it comes to @entity51 foreign policy			1
many members felt lied to by the @entity123 administration in the lead - up to the @entity98 war and worn out from a 12 - year - old war in @entity127			1
" there 's an increasing skepticism amongst those on the right and left when it comes to these types of foreign entanglements , " said @entity128 , former communications director for @entity130 majority leader @entity129 , @entity131			1
" members who were around ( during the @entity123 administration ) are determined that 's not going to happen again			1
" that is a sentiment made evident by @entity72 rep. @entity71			0
" the past decade has amply demonstrated the folly of military commitments poorly conceived , " he said			0
" our brave men and women in uniform deserve better			0
" @entity26 echoes @entity71 in his editorial			0
" understandably , @entity51 are not eager to be plunged into another questionable or misguided war , " he said			0
like with anything in politics , however , there 's a bit more to the story			0
it 's not just about the merits of war and congressional responsibility , but also about , well , politics			0
how the latest chemical weapons claim differs from others some lawmakers demanding congressional oversight " want to resist anything @entity30 does , " says @entity167 @entity166 , director of the @entity168 at @entity169			0
he says it looks good to their constituents back at home who oppose anything the president proposes			1
@entity166 speculates that if a @entity46 were president , the number of @entity46 who signed that letter would be less than 98 and @entity72 signatures would number more than 18			0
@entity106 said that war does n't suspend politics			0
" i 'm not sure that was ever true in the past , and it 's definitely not true now , " she said			0
" issues of war show up these fissures that are there all the time			0
" a bipartisan group of lawmakers challenging the president is only half the story			0
some lawmakers are much more measured			0
although many strongly urge the president to seek congressional authorization before any military strike , some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support a military strike			1
sen. @entity204 , @entity205 , chairman of @entity206 , said after a congressional briefing by the administration that " a decisive and consequential @entity51 response is justified and warranted			0
" sen. @entity210 , @entity211 , said on @entity1 's " @entity212 " on thursday that the @entity51 " should be helping ( the @entity10 rebels ) attain the goal of freeing themselves from one of the most brutal dictators in history			1
" @entity106 says many senators are old - guard lawmakers who have been dealing with issues of war and peace together since @entity222 and @entity223 in the ' 90s			0
it " reflects that those in the @entity130 have been chewing on these issues for 20 years , " she said			0
if @entity30 does allow @entity2 to vote on the use of military force , it 's unclear if the unholy alliance of the right and the left would stay united to oppose any military attack			1
there are " not so many consequences for posturing on the issue , " @entity106 said			0
but there are a lot more consequences for taking a vote on it .			0
