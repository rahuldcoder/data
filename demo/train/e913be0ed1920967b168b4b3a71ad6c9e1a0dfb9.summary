-- @entity1 has spent much of the past few weeks watching the action unfold on the television -- but the @entity4 says his injury - enforced absence has rekindled his passion for tennis			1
the @entity8 , who reached the final at @entity10 last year , returned to @entity11 thursday to finish off his rain delayed game with @entity14 before sweeping aside @entity16 's @entity15 6 - 2 6 - 2 in 56 minutes			1
and after shrugging off a recurrence of the back injury which he suffered at the @entity19 in may , @entity1 is far more grateful for the time he spends on court after being forced to withdraw from the @entity21			1
" i think it can be easy to take things for granted sometimes , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" you know , i played pretty much every slam for about seven years and i missed it			2
it was difficult watching and not being there			0
" you realize how much you love competing and you love being around the tournaments			0
" when everything is good and you 're healthy and you 're playing every week you do n't often think about it that much			0
" and when you 're away from it and you miss one of the biggest tournaments , one of the tournaments you prepare extremely hard for and put the hard work in for , then it 's tough			2
" i was really looking forward to getting back on the court again and hopefully i can have a good week			2
" @entity1 was beaten by @entity39 in the final at @entity10 just over 12 months ago but got revenge on the @entity42 by taking @entity44 gold in fine fashion			1
and after coming through the best part of two games in a single day , the 26 - year - old is confident he 's well on the way to regaining full fitness			1
that was what was most pleasing about the matches , " @entity1 said			1
" there was a lot of stops and starts on wednesday , having to warm up and cool down and stuff			0
" but everything felt good and i woke up this morning with no real stiffness , which is good			0
" i thought i moved pretty well			0
normally the first couple of matches here the court is quite slippery , and that 's something i have struggled with the last few years			1
" this time i have n't slipped down once			0
that has been a good sign			0
" @entity1 , who will be back on court friday to face @entity71 's @entity70 in the quarterfinals , added : " i probably feel a bit more confident coming into this grass court season because of how i played on it last year			1
" i think because i managed to win some big matches and play well on the grass last year , i know what i did well and what i need to keep doing			1
" elsewhere , @entity80 continued his impressive run of form with a 5 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 4 win over @entity85 @entity84			0
@entity80 , 32 , will face former @entity87 winner @entity86 , who needed less than an hour to see off @entity89 wildcard @entity88			0
second seed @entity90 eased through to the last eight with a 6 - 3 6 - 4 win over @entity95 's @entity94 and will now face defending champion @entity96			2
@entity97 was forced to play two three set matches in one day to book his place in the quarterfinals and a meeting with @entity85 's @entity102			1
@entity97 , seeded fourth , defeated fellow @entity103 , @entity106 6 - 3 6 - 7 6 - 3 early thursday before seeing off @entity105 @entity104 7 - 5 5 - 7 6 - 3			2
elsewhere , @entity107 continued the defense of his title at the @entity110 by reaching the last eight with a straight sets win over @entity113			0
@entity107 will play @entity114 for a place in the last eight			0
