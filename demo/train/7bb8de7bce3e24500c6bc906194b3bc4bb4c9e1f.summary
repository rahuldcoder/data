-- oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 on fears that tensions with @entity5 have the potential to disrupt supplies through the @entity8			1
the price of a barrel of brent crude hit $ 128.40 a barrel and eclipsed $ 110 on the @entity13 after a disputed report thursday on @entity5 's @entity15 and other @entity17 outlets of a pipeline explosion in @entity19			1
prices for brent crude dropped to $ 125.45 and $ 108.50 on the @entity13 early friday			0
" i think the main problems are coming from some supply disruptions , or some fear to supply disruptions , particularly @entity5 , " @entity22 chief @entity21 told a @entity24 @entity23 on wednesday			1
" so i 'm not sure what could provide relief in the very short term			0
" the price of @entity34 brent crude has risen more than 15 % this year , while @entity13 crude has risen more than 8.5 % on growing tensions surrounding @entity5 and fears that may lead to the closure of the @entity8 , a critical pathway for petroleum exports			1
opinion : @entity24 , quit whining about gas " frankly , it has nothing to do with supply and demand there -- these are geopolitical situations , " @entity43 , head of the @entity44 , told @entity0			2
" so it has to be solved at that level			0
" while worries in the @entity17 have caused a spike , oil prices face longer - term pressure due to increased demand from @entity57 and other emerging economies			1
at 9.4 million barrels a day , @entity57 consumes half the amount of oil of the @entity24 , according to 2010 data from the @entity62			1
but while @entity24 usage has remained flat , @entity57 's oil consumption rises about 5 % per year			2
@entity57 is now the world 's largest automobile market			2
last year , 18 million vehicles were sold in @entity57 , compared with about 13 million in the @entity24			2
@entity68 on soaring gas prices : no silver bullet " it 's not just more people driving , it 's also every product that you buy is made of plastic or synthetic materials out of @entity57 is made with oil , " said @entity71 of @entity72			1
after the @entity24 and @entity57 , @entity79 is a top consumer with 4.4 million barrels a day , followed by @entity81 ( 3.1 million ) and @entity82 ( 3 million )			0
if oil prices continue to rise , analysts worry it will hurt developing economies whose growth has helped buoy @entity89 economies struggling with tepid growth and the threat of recession			1
" very high oil prices will dampen any kind of recovery and any kind of growth even during normal times , " @entity43 said			1
" it 's not desirable			0
it is something we would like not to have			0
" @entity24 gas high ? not as high as @entity103 rising oil prices , however , present a silver lining for @entity79 , which has been struggling with deflation for years , says @entity107 , managing director of research of @entity109 in @entity110			1
" oil is rising because global demand for goods and services is accelerating			2
and @entity79 is a big beneficiary of that because @entity79 is such a powerful exporter , so volumes are picking up much , much faster than costs are picking up for corporate @entity79 , " @entity107 said			0
" bad news would be a supply shock - if you did have a blockade of the @entity8 or a war in the @entity17 , " @entity107 said			0
" you 'd have a big supply disruption , that would be cost push and @entity79 would get a double punch with declining global growth as well as an increase in costs really squeezing profits			0
" @entity0 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report			0
