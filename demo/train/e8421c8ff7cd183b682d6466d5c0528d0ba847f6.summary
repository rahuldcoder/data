-- for nearly two weeks , i was a failure -- a complete and utter failure			2
ever since october 1 , when @entity3 went live , i 've tried to go on the site and enroll			1
i do n't need health insurance -- i get it from my employer -- but i wanted to see how easy ( or difficult ) it is for the millions of @entity9 who do need insurance and want to shop on the new exchanges set up by @entity13			1
for about a week , i could n't even create a login and password , the necessary first step for shopping			0
then finally i could , but when i tried to log in , i received error messages ; sometimes i even saw the dreaded twirly thing that just went ' round and ' round			1
when i tried to make a new account , that did n't work either			0
i called the @entity3 1 - 800 - number for help , and the representatives said the site was very busy			1
they suggested i try at off - peak hours , such as early in the morning or late at night			0
following their advice , i made attempts at 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. still no luck			0
apparently those hours were n't off - peak enough , so on saturday night i kissed my husband and daughters good night and set my alarm for 3 a.m. for a date with @entity3			1
but in the wee hours of sunday morning , i was to meet with only more disappointment			0
" the system is down at the moment , " read the message on the screen			0
" we 're currently making system improvements			0
" i tried to go back to sleep but could n't			0
i 've covered health care reform for 25 years , first as a print reporter in @entity46 and then for @entity0			0
i interviewed sen. @entity47 about catastrophic coverage in the late 1980s , reported on @entity50 's health care plan in the 1990s and have followed every twist and turn of the health care reform debate since 2009			1
over the years i 've watched countless people suffer because they could n't get insurance			1
in my @entity57 column i 've tried to help the uninsured muddle through by explaining how to negotiate hospital fees or get help paying for prescription drugs , for example			0
but i knew my words were @entity64 -- flimsy , torn @entity64 without much sticky stuff , at best			0
these people needed insurance , plain and simple			1
it 's been a roller - coaster ride for them as health care reform passed in 2010 and was then challenged in the @entity72			2
in the weeks before that decision , @entity73 , a dad in @entity74 , cried in an interview with me , worried out of his mind about what would happen if the court overturned @entity13 and his young daughter , who has a rare and devastating illness , lost her insurance			2
@entity73 cried tears of joy the day the @entity72 upheld the @entity13			0
millions like him were relieved that health insurance would finally be a sure thing , not something they had to yearn for or worry over			2
success on day 14 of @entity13 site october 1 was supposed to be the big day -- the day they could finally buy a policy without worrying about denials for pre-existing conditions or sky - high premiums that only millionaires could afford			1
but when the big day rolled around , after years of waiting , for many their hopes were dashed as they could n't enroll on the site			2
their frustration practically jumps off the pages of the government 's @entity105 , where they 've lodged their complaints			1
the @entity109 administration ascribes the trouble to " glitches " due to high traffic on the site			1
the president compared it to a glitch with @entity117 's recently launched @entity116			2
but @entity117 's glitch was fixed quickly and , even more importantly , was never a big deal in the first place -- the operating system was functional even with the glitch			2
@entity3 's glitches , on the other hand , are so overwhelming that @entity125 of the @entity127 's @entity126 has deemed it a " failure , " at least so far			1
' a failure , " @entity125 wrote			0
' @entity131 ' system still has ' glitches ' there is , however , a light at the end of the tunnel			2
the government continues to work on the site , and monday morning , i finally tasted some victory			1
three times , i tried to log in and failed			0
twice i tried to create new accounts but could n't			0
the third time , however , i was successful			0
i managed to log in and proceed with an application			0
i should n't have had to create a new account , of course , and the site is still spotty -- i could n't log back in monday afternoon , and then i could log in tuesday -- but at least it 's a start			1
we 've been hearing from others , too , that the site seems to be getting better			2
this snafu is not completely without precedent either			0
in 2005 , the launch of the @entity155 's website was considerably delayed and riddled with glitches			1
they fixed the problems though , and the program is now generally considered a success			0
what we do n't know is how long it will take to fix the major problems with @entity3			1
people who want insurance by january 1 need to sign up by december 15			1
will the site be fully functioning by then ? i 'll be going back to @entity3 every day to see how it 's doing			1
i hope to get no more error messages , no advice to try again later , and goodness knows , no twirly things			1
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity3 users have been *plagued* by glitches and error messages
government attributes site 's troubles to high *volume* of traffic
people who want insurance by january 1 need to sign up by december 15
