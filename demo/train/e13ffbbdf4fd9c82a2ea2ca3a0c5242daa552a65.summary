a @entity2 college student died from the same strain of meningitis seen in an outbreak at @entity6 , the @entity0 said tuesday			1
the @entity8 student died march 10 from meningitis b , or " @entity11 meningococcal disease , " the @entity0 said in a statement			1
lab analysis showed the disease matched the strain seen at @entity6 through " genetic fingerprinting , " health officials said			1
" the public health investigation of the @entity8 student revealed that the student had been in close contact with students from @entity6 about a week before becoming ill , " the @entity0 said			1
the death raises concern the outbreak strain may still be present in the @entity6 community , health officials said			1
starting in december , a " high percentage " of @entity6 undergraduates and eligible graduate students received an unlicensed meningitis vaccination called @entity26			1
while the vaccine is approved for use in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , it is not yet approved for use in the @entity37			0
the @entity0 and the @entity38 granted approval for the vaccine to be distributed at @entity6			1
last month , @entity41 was also distributed to students at the @entity43 , @entity43 , which had an outbreak involving four cases of of meningococcal disease unrelated to the @entity6 outbreak			1
meningococcal disease can cause meningitis or blood infections			2
nine cases of group b meningitis have been associated with the @entity6 outbreak , @entity6 said on its web site tuesday			1
eight cases were previously reported ; the new number includes the @entity8 case , said @entity6 spokesman @entity57			1
the @entity0 noted no new cases have been seen at @entity6 since the vaccinations began on december 9			1
" available data show most adolescents that get two doses of this vaccine are protected from getting meningococcal disease , " the @entity0 said			0
" however , vaccinated individuals may still be able to carry the bacteria in their throats , which could infect others through close contact			0
" no related cases have been reported at @entity8 , the @entity0 said			2
health officials were investigating whom the student may have been in contact with and providing antibiotics			2
a statement on the @entity6 website tuesday urged members of the university community to " continue to be vigilant in following good health practices to prevent the spread of this illness			2
" meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord , known as the meninges			0
infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation , according to the @entity0			0
college students are especially vulnerable , and dorms are the perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak , health officials say			2
@entity99 spreads through coughing , sneezing , and kissing			0
it can also spread when people forget to wash their hands or clothes , or among people who drink out of the same cup			0
@entity106 is tricky , since students who catch it may first think they have the flu			0
it starts with flulike symptoms : fever , headache , stiff necks , vomiting and delirium			0
if the bacteria spread to the meninges , patients can suffer hearing loss , permanent neurological damage and even death			0
in 2012 , there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the @entity37 , according to the @entity0			0
of those , 160 were group @entity126			0
