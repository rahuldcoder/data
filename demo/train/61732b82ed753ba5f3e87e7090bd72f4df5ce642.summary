-- @entity1 has decided not to make a charitable donation to the victims of the @entity4 as part of the social projects it has opted to support during @entity9 , which is being co-hosted by @entity10 and @entity11			1
a botched reactor safety test at @entity4 in @entity10 -- then part of the @entity14 -- set off the worst nuclear accident in history , with the radiation effects of the 1986 explosion about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on @entity20 during @entity21 , and nearly 14 times greater than the disaster last year at the @entity24 plant in @entity25			1
" there are no plans to make donations to the victims of the @entity4 , " @entity1 said in a statement given to @entity0			1
" however , children from chernobyl disaster regions in @entity10 and @entity32 have received an invitation , extended by @entity1 president @entity34 , to attend one of the @entity9 matches			1
there will be a total of 125 children attending the match in @entity41 on june 19 between @entity42 and @entity43			0
" the chairman of the @entity45 described @entity1 's decision as paying ' lip - service ' to the victims of @entity4			1
" this is a hugely significant tournament and a unique opportunity to highlight the ongoing consequences of the @entity4 , " said @entity49			1
" hundreds of thousands of children in @entity32 , @entity10 and @entity54 are still affected today			0
ironically , charities from the 16 nations participating in the @entity57 are working in the affected regions , trying their best to mitigate the consequences of @entity4 with very limited resources			2
" this could have been a golden opportunity to raise both awareness and funds for the ' children of @entity4 ' while simultaneously giving much - needed credibility and kudos to @entity1 and @entity34			1
" more than 200,000 people were evacuated following the disaster , never to return			2
a 2005 report by " the @entity70 " ( the most comprehensive to date ) estimated that more than five million remain in what have been termed " contaminated territories , " and 250,000 live in " highly contaminated territories			2
" figures released by @entity75 in 2010 showed that more than 20 % of adolescent children in @entity32 , which neighbors @entity10 , suffered from disabilities and chronic illness			0
@entity32 absorbed 70 % of @entity4 's fallout			2
" twenty - six years after the @entity4 catastrophe , hundreds of villages and towns remain radioactively contaminated and millions of people , many of whom are children , live in these areas , " said @entity49			1
" these children and their families have had to adapt and ' forget ' about the radiation as they have no choice but to live where they are			0
popular pastimes like collecting berries and mushrooms and walking in the forest are forbidden in contaminated areas but as time progresses the radiation signs are often ignored			0
" @entity49 added : " the government is now systematically declassifying villages and towns as contaminated , " added the @entity45 chairman			1
" this is not based on any scientific evidence and entire towns and villages that may well still be radioactively contaminated are now being classified as ' clean ' and ' safe ' to live in			0
" this is purely economical as families living in the ' zones ' are entitled to certain ' privileges ' -- a free holiday in a different part of the country for children , once a year and a meager allowance for the family			0
" @entity1 , which made a net profit of $ 312.5 million during @entity118 , is to make a contribution of $ 3.75 million to its respect campaign -- @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and respect your health			1
the respect diversity project is being run by @entity127 ( @entity127 )			0
two fare international monitors will attend each match during @entity9 to identify racist behavior and far - right banners			0
former @entity133 defender @entity132 has warned fans not to travel to @entity11 or @entity10 following a @entity136 documentary accusing football fans from the two countries of racism and also questioned why both nations were awarded the tournament in the first place			0
@entity1 says the profits for the 2008 tournament were used to finance all its youth and women 's competitions until 2012 , its complete refereeing and coaching programs and some of its administrative costs .			2
