" whether that 's my @entity15 party or their @entity36 party , they 're not getting my help			2
i do n't want to help them , " he said emphatically			0
but his political expertise -- especially with the @entity22 campaign - helped make his business boom			1
" i do n't pretend to know how to market a restaurant but i do know something about social media from all that we were doing in 2008 , so we built a lot of our reputation , we built a community on @entity45 and @entity53 and other social media outlets , " said @entity16 , who added that the café has 7,100 people on its @entity45 page , and has done no paid advertising			1
