@entity0 -- he was talking about health care , but president @entity4 could have just as easily been summing up his entire first year when he made some blunt comments in a closed - door meeting with @entity8 @entity7 last week			1
@entity7 sources who were in the room say @entity4 , pressed by liberals angry about the reform package getting watered down , decided to quote sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , who said recently : " what we 're building here is not a mansion , it 's a starter home			1
it 's a starter home , but it 's got a great foundation for expanding health care coverage to 31 million @entity23			2
" @entity4 's point was that he believes the health bill -- if it can pass ( and that 's in real doubt now ) -- would be a dramatic step forward but is just the first draft			1
he hopes to come back later in his presidency to pass a second reform package that finishes the job			0
the same goes for other big @entity4 promises like energy reform to deal with climate change and financial regulatory reform to clean up @entity36 -- " mansions " that have not been built yet , even though a strong " foundation " has been put down to meet these promises in the future			1
but @entity44 @entity43 's stunning victory in @entity45 on tuesday suggests @entity4 may not even get the first draft of health care reform through @entity48 , because of a huge split in his own party : angry liberals in the @entity8 are signaling they will not rush through what they consider to be the @entity54 's weak version of reform before @entity43 gets seated in the @entity54 , while skittish conservative democrats in the @entity54 , like @entity57 of @entity58 , may no longer be on board with any kind of reform , out of a fear of becoming the next @entity63			1
the broader problem @entity4 has been facing , even before @entity45 , is that securing a mere " starter home " on health care or any other major issue is a far cry from the sky - high expectations he set for his supporters one year ago , when they were shouting " @entity75 ! " after a campaign in which he laid out plans for dramatic change			1
to be fair , the president warned in his inaugural address , one year ago wednesday , that all of the nation 's problems would not be solved so quickly			0
" they are serious , and they are many , " he said then			0
" they will not be met easily or in a short span of time			0
" nevertheless , most @entity23 skipped past that section of the speech , and focused instead on @entity4 's promise to end the bitter partisan divide in @entity0 on the way to shaking up the system			1
that goodwill from the early days evaporated quickly , and the president 's approval ratings have dipped as disappointment has grown among the very independent voters who helped elect him in 2008			0
that 's why he very deliberately tried to recalibrate expectations at a @entity0 church this sunday as he delivered remarks celebrating the birthday of the rev. @entity104 " there was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that i swore that oath , " @entity4 said			1
" of course , as we meet here today , one year later , we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled			0
because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise , because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations , because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe , we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before			0
" poll : 51 percent approve of @entity4 after first year channeling the outrage that fueled @entity43 's upset victory in @entity45 , @entity132 @entity131 of @entity133 said the reason for the disconnect is that the president dropped the talk of unity too quickly and instead " forged ahead with a narrow ideological agenda that has compromised his ability to create sustainable jobs and thereby fix our nation 's most pressing problems			1
" in an op - ed on the new conservative web site @entity149 , @entity131 charged his party has offered to work with the president but he has " paid our proposals mere lip service when the cameras are on , only to rebuff our ideas in their entirety once the meeting ends			0
as a result , the history books may well look back on the beginning of the @entity4 presidency as the era of squandered opportunities			2
" @entity8 press secretary @entity164 insists republicans have not made serious overtures to meet the president halfway , perhaps hoping instead that @entity4 's struggles will help the @entity44 in the november midterm elections			1
and @entity164 says the real reason for @entity4 's problems stems from the fact that he made some tough decisions on unpopular -- but necessary -- government interventions to save the economy			1
" ensuring that the banks did n't collapse was not a popular decision , " @entity164 said			0
" the president strongly believes it was the right one			0
ensuring that two domestic auto companies did n't go out of business -- not popular			0
again , the president believed it was the right decision to make			0
" @entity4 also frequently reminds the public that in addition to inheriting that financial crisis , he was also handed two unpopular wars , in @entity188 and @entity189 , and a continuing threat from @entity191 , that have tested his mettle as commander in chief			2
all of that has weighed on @entity4 's approval rating , especially the difficult decision to send more than 50,000 additional @entity23 troops to escalate the war in @entity189			2
the terror incident on @entity200 was a fresh reminder that national security is a wild card for any president			0
as each day in office passes , it will become harder and harder for @entity4 to continue pointing the finger of blame at former president @entity209 for all of the " inherited " problems			2
and in a strange way , tuesday 's election loss could help @entity4 refocus his agenda at the start of year two			1
a top @entity7 strategist close to the @entity8 said that it 's a lot better for the @entity8 to take its lumps now and readjust priorities in the weeks ahead to avoid much larger losses in the midterm election -- rather than coasting along now and then getting hit with an awful surprise in november			1
but will @entity4 and his top aides dig in and refuse to move to the middle a bit ? or will they acknowledge that @entity45 is a wake - up call , as @entity229 sen. @entity228 and other moderate @entity7 have suggested , and make some adjustments ? then - president @entity231 was briefly humiliated by the 1994 midterm election debacle caused in large part by his overreaching health care effort , but he quickly picked himself up off the canvas and started focusing on bite - sized initiatives that won @entity44 support and positioned him for an easy re-election victory in 1996			1
@entity239 , head of the liberal health group @entity240 , is pushing @entity4 to finish off health reform quickly before @entity7 lose their 60 - vote supermajority in the @entity54			1
but @entity239 also said he thinks on some of the other big issues after health reform , like climate change and @entity36 regulatory reform , " they will have to get some @entity44 " lawmakers on board , and the new political reality may force some compromise on both sides			2
but @entity239 added that it 's " way premature " to suggest the @entity45 race will bring a major shift to the political climate			2
he 's still confident that as the unemployment picture improves down the road , " people will see the good in @entity4 's policies " on health and other matters , and his standing will improve			2
of course , there 's also the possibility the public mood continues to sour on the economy and @entity4 's other key initiatives like health care			2
@entity43 seemed to be warning in his victory speech tuesday night that the anti-incumbent anger @entity4 rode into office could wind up blowing up in his face in november			0
" what happened here in @entity45 can happen all over @entity23 , " @entity43 said to cheers			0
in fact , when @entity43 talked about scrapping the health reform effort and starting over because " we can do better , " the @entity44 crowd started a chant that had to send a tiny shiver down the spine of even the most confident @entity8 staffer			1
" yes we can ! " @entity43 's supporters shouted			0
" yes we can ! "			0

@entity4 stresses building foundation for future steps toward his agenda
@entity44 win in @entity45 could create split among @entity7
@entity4 also faces gap between high hopes at his inauguration and reality now
one expert says it 's better for @entity8 to take its lumps now , before midterm elections
