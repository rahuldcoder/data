, is rolling out some marked improvements to its @entity10 product			0
these upgrades include hi - res photos , photo - download links , bulk tagging options and an elegant lightbox interface for viewing images from anywhere on the site			1
the lightbox in particular reminds us of similar features recently rolled out by @entity23 ; and some of these improvements , such as hi - res and downloading capabilities , are what have prevented @entity1 from serious competition with @entity23 as a photo - sharing destination			1
in the recent past , @entity1 photos were best for capturing memories of places , people and events through small images and mobile snapshots ; however , these changes allow a whole new class of image - sharing , up to and including photography , modeling and graphic design portfolios			2
with its 500 million users around the world , @entity1 is now poised to take over the photo - sharing market			2
beginning today and rolling out to all users soon , you will be able to upload and download hi - res photos up to 2048 pixels wide or high -- that 's large enough for print - quality images			1
( currently , @entity1 only displays 720 pixels ; larger photos simply get resized			0
) each photo will come with a link to download the jpeg file , as well			0
follow @entity0 social media on @entity58 the site 's new bulk tagging options will allow the uploading individual to temporarily group images and tag friends by simply clicking on thumbnails			2
another interesting change is @entity1 's @entity66 , which strongly and clearly puts the focus on images			1
starting soon , any time you click on an image anywhere on @entity1 , be it in an album or in your @entity75 or on a friend 's @entity76 , you 'll see a black box hovering over the rest of the screen with some minimal navigation controls and relevant social features , allowing you to concentrate completely on the image at hand			0
while we do n't love the ads in place here , we do realize that hosting hi - res photos costs a lot more and will attract a lot more usage -- both from uploading parties and from viewing individuals -- all of which puts more strain on @entity1 's servers			1
we 'll sacrifice an ad - free experience for higher quality photos			0
what do you think about these changes ? do you think @entity1 -- which already competes with @entity58 as a status service , @entity104 as an advertiser , and every major social network as a digital hub for friends -- will soon be competing with @entity23 for the photos of pros and amateurs alike ?
