-- @entity2 candidates @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have captured the attention of the country this election season , but they 're just a few of the record number of women pursuing office this year			1
more than 160 women congressional and gubernatorial candidates won their primaries and will be on the ballot next week , leading some observers to dub 2010 the " @entity18			0
" this year 's record - breaking numbers are encouraging , but deceiving , said @entity20 , president of the women 's @entity21			1
" we 're ranked 90th in the world in the number of women in elected office			1
we trail behind @entity33 and @entity34 , " she said , citing data from the @entity29 on the percentage of women in national parliaments			0
" [ people ] look at @entity37 's run for @entity38			0
she 's secretary of state			0
they look at [ house speaker ] @entity41 and say , ' oh , we got there ! we have parity , ' " @entity43 said			0
" nothing could be further from the truth			0
" @entity43 worries that for the first time in more than 30 years , we 'll see a backslide in the percentage of women in @entity38 , particularly among @entity51			1
democrats are expected to lose seats in the @entity54 and @entity55 , and the female lawmakers in office are overwhelmingly @entity51			1
there are 13 @entity51 women in the @entity55 , compared to just four @entity2 women			1
in the @entity54 , there are 56 women who are @entity51 and 17 who are @entity2			1
" the deeper problem underneath all this is we do not have a pipeline or a bench of women prepared to step up and run for the inevitable number of women that we are going to lose this cycle , " added @entity43 , who was the @entity51 nominee for @entity65 's @entity64 in 2008			1
" she should run , " a program run by the women 's @entity21 , is an effort to recruit and equip women candidates			2
the program also encourages women to ask other women to consider making a bid for office			2
@entity85 : @entity86 shares her thoughts on women in politics in a potential blow to the current crop of female candidates , women voters are n't as pumped about heading to the polls this year , according to national surveys			1
" we have n't seen this in the past , but this year it does look like women are less enthusiastic about voting than men are , " said @entity0 polling director @entity96			2
in a commentary for @entity0 , @entity103 and @entity104 , both with ms. @entity105 , pointed to a number of factors leading to lower levels of excitement : women feel overburdened by the state of the economy , turned off by the current state of @entity116 political affairs			0
" the rhetoric of this political season may not be what we want or like , but times are simply too tough for millions of women to sit this one out , " they wrote			0
@entity123 , a former congressional candidate and current director of the @entity125 at @entity126 , says it is not specifically women who are low on enthusiasm this year			0
" women are disproportionately registered as @entity51			2
so it 's not necessarily that women are less excited and less interested -- it 's that @entity51 are , and that indirectly means women are , " she said			2
based on her experience campaigning for the midterms , @entity136 , president of the @entity137 , said she thinks interest among @entity2 women is higher than ever			1
" the enthusiasm that i 'm seeing as i travel across the @entity116 has just been overwhelming , " she said			0
" the enthusiasm i think is at its peak			0
i do n't know that i 've ever seen in the past 12 years at the national level such a camaraderie for our women in moving forward and running as candidates			0
" the female candidates , she added , are bringing a new tone to the @entity2			2
" my adrenaline is pumping , " @entity136 said			0
" it is the year of the @entity2 woman			1
i pray to @entity155 that on november 3 i 'm right			0
" @entity123 , who is less optimistic about @entity156 , says she expects at best , women will hold steady at 17 seats in the @entity55 and lose four to six seats in the @entity54			1
" all of the pieces were in play for an anti-establishment , @entity162 , anti-incumbency year , and we 've seen that happen , " she said			0
" @entity2 women running this cycle have an opportunity to represent that which is not currently in power -- which tend to be @entity51 establishment candidates			1
" 1992 -- the previous " @entity18 " -- was really the year of the @entity51 woman , because that was who represented the anti-establishment candidate at the time , @entity123 said			1
" it 's shaping up to look like the year of the @entity2			2
and it turns out that in some of the most high - profile races , the @entity2 actually have women running			2

a record number of women run for office , but experts fear women will actually lose seats
democrats expected to lose seats , and female lawmakers are mostly @entity51
@entity191 predicts women will hold steady in @entity55 and lose a few seats in @entity54
but *veteran* campaigner @entity136 says , " it is the year of the @entity2 woman "
