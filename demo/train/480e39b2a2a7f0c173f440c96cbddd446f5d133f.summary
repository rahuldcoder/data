-- @entity1 in @entity2 is as busy as any restaurant might be during the lunch hour rush			0
nestled in a part of the market area known as @entity7 , @entity1 is run by @entity8 from @entity9 , providing a home away from home for other @entity9 jews			1
@entity15 , the matriarch of her family , is just one of tens of thousands of @entity9 jews who immigrated to @entity18 during the course of the last 60 years			1
she arrived in @entity18 in 1964 from @entity20 , where her sister still lives to this day			2
in @entity9 there are an estimated 25,000 @entity8 remaining in the country , making it the largest @entity25 population center for the religion outside of @entity18			1
@entity15 , like many @entity9 jews in @entity18 , still keeps in touch with relatives back home			1
she says there are no problems between @entity8 and @entity33 in @entity9			1
@entity8 , she explains , can practice their faith freely in @entity9 and are not persecuted			1
but for most in @entity18 , talk of @entity9 focuses on the country 's nuclear program and what the government here believes is @entity43 's drive to develop nuclear weapons			1
the @entity9 government steadfastly maintains its program is peaceful in nature			2
for @entity9 jews living in @entity18 , the debate about their homeland can not be escaped and in their market community in @entity2 there 's a keen awareness of the potential for an @entity18 strike			1
take @entity57 , a spice shop owner			0
he came to @entity18 from @entity9 forty years ago			1
he says the @entity9 nuclear issue is a big mess , hard to understand with both @entity18 and @entity9 waiting to see who will act first			1
there are between 100,000 and 200,000 @entity9 jews and their descendants in @entity18 , and despite the hostile relations between @entity18 and @entity9 , they 're still able to closely follow events in their country of origin through internet radio stations like @entity69 in which broadcasts from @entity2			1
one caller from @entity9 to the station says he wo n't be voting in the country 's upcoming elections as he believes they will be rigged			2
@entity76 , one of the station 's presenters , says that after hearing stories from other callers , he believes the economic sanctions are really beginning to hurt the @entity9 regime			2
it 's a view shared by analyst @entity84 , himself originally from @entity9 and who is now at the @entity87 college in @entity18			1
he says the regime in @entity43 is in danger because the economic price being paid for its nuclear program as a result of sanctions is actually " a bigger existential threat to the @entity9 than to the @entity18			2
" the sanctions are beginning to bite , says @entity84			0
a strike by @entity18 , he continues , should be only as a last resort			0
a strike , he argues , would be " bad for two reasons			0
number one , it would help the longevity of the @entity9 regime			0
number two , it could motivate it more to build the bomb			0
" back at the restaurant , @entity15 is not concerned about the tension over @entity9 's nuclear program			0
" i do n't believe it , " she says			0
" it 's a bluff			0
we believe in good things			0
@entity114 told us to believe in the best			0
" on her wall , as if a throwback to earlier and presumably better times for @entity15 and before the creation of the @entity119 of @entity9 , hangs a portrait of the @entity122 and his son			0
@entity9 @entity8 like @entity15 and @entity57 may be hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as politicians negotiate the future in the corridors of power , far away from this bustling @entity2 neighborhood .			2

@entity9 is largest @entity25 population center for @entity8 outside of @entity18
jews can practice faith freely in @entity9 without persecution , says one @entity9 jew
