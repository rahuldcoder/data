@entity1 's governor estimated friday it will take about $ 15 million to fix a bridge on @entity4 that collapsed into a river after being struck by an 18 - wheeler , shutting down a portion of the state 's main artery to @entity9			1
the news came at the start of the busy holiday weekend as state and federal investigators worked to figure out what led to thursday 's collapse of the bridge , which sent vehicles tumbling into the @entity18 near @entity19 , about 60 miles north of @entity20			1
while at least three people were taken to hospitals , there were no fatalities			0
gov. @entity25 declared a state of emergency in @entity1 's northwestern counties of @entity18 , @entity28 and @entity29 , noting that the highway is a major conduit and its closure -- for a " significant period " -- will hurt the area 's economy and its residents			1
it 's unclear how long the interstate will be closed for the bridge repairs			1
@entity40 inspectors were expected to spend 7 to 10 days investigating the crash , said @entity40 chairwoman @entity42			1
showing ' its age ' an initial investigation shows the 1,111 foot - long bridge collapsed when a tractor - trailer hauling an oversized load hit one of the bridge 's overhead tresses , known as the " superstructure , " @entity42 said			1
" obviously , this is a bridge that has lived a very long life , " she told reporters			2
while the bridge built in 1955 is showing " its age , " it appears to have been structurally sound			2
as part of the investigation , the @entity40 will review the state 's maintenance and inspection records as well as any damage reports and repairs made to the bridge , @entity42 said			1
a heavy traffic backup along @entity4 was reported in both directions by midday friday as cars and trucks inched along a cumbersome detour that took vehicles off the interstate and onto county roads			0
roughly 70,000 vehicles travel that portion of the interstate a day , according to the @entity77 of @entity78			0
the collapse apparently was the result of a collision between the tractor - trailer 's cargo and the bridge , @entity80 sgt. @entity79 told @entity87 on friday			1
the truck was hauling equipment for a drilling rig , he said			1
' hold on ' @entity91 was driving behind the 18 - wheeler when he saw it strike one of the bridge 's overhead support structures , and then saw the bridge give way			1
he slammed on the brakes , but the momentum of his pickup and camper trailer carried @entity91 and his wife off the bridge and into the water dozens of feet below , he told @entity87 affiliate @entity105 , hours after the incident some 60 miles north of @entity20			2
" you hold on as tight as you can , " @entity91 said			0
then , a " white flash and cold water			0
" the impact dislocated his shoulder , but the @entity113 veteran just popped it back in and dragged his unresponsive wife to safety			0
a second vehicle with one person inside also fell from the bridge , according to state officials			1
amazingly , no one died			0
@entity91 's wife , @entity121 , was the only one of the three who remained hospitalized friday			2
she was in stable condition , according to @entity124			0
" rough day , " @entity91 told @entity105			0
" glad to be here breathing			0
" ' functionally obsolete ' the bridge had been rated " functionally obsolete , " according to a federal database , but state officials said it was safe to drive on			1
that category is for bridges that may have narrow lanes or shoulders , or spans that do n't provide enough vertical clearance to let tall trucks pass , according to @entity1 's @entity137			1
the bridge was inspected as recently as november , said @entity139 , a spokesman for the @entity140			2
" we would n't be having drivers drive on this bridge if we thought there were any concerns whatsoever , " he said friday			1
@entity91 told @entity105 he was traveling south on the interstate behind the tractor - trailer when he realized the load appeared to be about four feet too wide to fit through the bridge 's superstructure			1
" any time he wants to go over to the left would be ok , " @entity91 said he told his wife			0
but another tractor - trailer appeared to hem the truck in to the right lane			2
" there was a big puff of dust , and i hit the brakes			0
" @entity162 told @entity87 affiliate king that he was driving near the tractor - trailer 's pilot car when he saw a device on that car designed to indicate whether a truck can clear an obstacle hit the top of the bridge			1
he then watched in his rear - view mirror as the truck struck the bridge , he told @entity175			2
" it almost tipped the truck over but it came back down			0
it tipped it up to about a 30 - degree angle to the left and it came back down on its wheels , and almost instantaneously behind that i saw girders falling in my rear - view mirror , " he said			0
the tractor - trailer did not go into the water			0
the driver was questioned but not detained , state police said			0
emergency funding the @entity191 @entity140 released $ 1 million in emergency funding for the bridge , @entity25 said friday on @entity194			1
@entity25 said the accident starkly demonstrates the need for additional funding for roads and bridges			0
" we have some work to do on our bridges whether or not this accident happened , and we have some discussions in @entity206 " -- the state capital -- " about making sure that we make investments in bridges to prevent this kind of thing from happening , " he told reporters			0
in march , president @entity211 called on @entity212 to provide $ 21 billion for infrastructure construction , including improvements to existing @entity215 : how safe is that bridge you 're driving on ?			2
