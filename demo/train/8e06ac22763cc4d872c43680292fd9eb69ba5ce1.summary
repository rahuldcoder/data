@entity0 -- on a chilly saturday afternoon , a man with all the time in the world stands outside the bus he calls home			2
while he takes in a view of the @entity8 , @entity6 boasts he lives on 84 square feet of pure luxury			1
" it 's a cherished spot for me , " he says , " something that is a little sacred			2
" @entity6 , 58 , a retired father of three , is in the middle of a 10 - year journey to spread kindness across the country			1
so far he 's logged almost 60,000 miles on a school bus he bought and has lived in for four years			1
his @entity18 terrier , @entity17 , keeps him company			1
the bus advertises his mission in giant letters painted on one side , " @entity24			2
" it 's a goal , he says , a person under 30 can realistically meet if he or she makes it a point to be kind to someone every day			1
" it 's a constant reminder that i have chosen this path to be as kind as i can in every possible way , " he says			1
the impact of @entity35 @entity6 says he felt compelled to champion kindness after learning a gunman had killed 32 people on april 16 , 2007 , at @entity39 he had begun a period of introspection , realizing he was n't satisfied with his lifestyle , which he considered " cushy			1
" his construction business had become just a job , and he felt unfulfilled with the direction of his life , especially with his kids headed off to college			2
" it seemed like there was a higher meaning in going forward with life , " he says			2
" that 's when @entity39 happened			1
" @entity6 drove to @entity39 the week of the shootings and talked to people about their experiences dealing with the tragedy			1
it was n't just one conversation that affected him but the range of emotions he saw that week , which , he says , motivated him to change his life			1
he returned to his home near @entity63 , and the single father told his children that he planned to sell all his belongings and drive to university campuses across the country to talk about kindness			1
daughter @entity70 , 23 , says she and her siblings were taken aback but not surprised			2
they always said @entity73 was kind			1
" it was a different step than most people take in their life , " his 25 - year - old son , @entity74 , says			2
" i was proud that he left and he was going to do something he felt was right and needed to do			0
" reminders april 16 -- the date is as familiar to @entity6 as it is to anyone the @entity39 shootings personally affected			1
meeting recently with the @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity86 , he told the group what that day meant , but @entity6 says he was saddened to see a crowd of blank faces			1
" that 's how these events end up being lost in the public memory , " he says			0
" the @entity18 bombings ( were ) on april 15 , and there was so much coverage on april 16 , april 17 and april 18			1
here was an event that was so big six years ago that hardly got a mention			0
" @entity6 says we live in a " post-it note " society , where people need constant reminders to love and care for one another			1
he sets at least four alarms each day to remind him to think about others and what he can do to spread kindness			1
small gestures can help folks get into the habit of being kind , he says			2
" if you want to say a prayer , or a moment of silence , " he says , that 's what you should do			0
" whatever you need to do to honor someone			0
" on the road @entity6 made good on his vow to sell his home and belongings , taking an early retirement to embark on his journey of kindness			1
he funds it with his savings and retirement checks but also accepts small donations			0
" it 's all a buck here , 20 bucks there , that sort of thing , " he says			0
he drives to places where the weather is nice , visiting elementary schools and senior centers to drop off fliers announcing his mission			0
those organizations will call him up ( sometimes up to a year later ) and ask him to come give a talk			2
a couple of years ago , he added a bike to his travels and has ridden it nearly 18,000 miles to spark up conversations with the people he encounters about issues such as domestic violence and child abuse			2
he placed two stickers on the back of his bike telling people what they should do : " be a man			0
do n't raise a hand			0
stop domestic violence , " and " stop childhood sexual abuse now			0
" by the handlebars , a big black - and - white sign reads : " boys should never hit girls , " a message to which the children respond			0
" these are issues as i 'm driving across the country i 'm hearing so much , " he says			0
" i 'm having firsthand conversations with people losing loved ones because of suicide			0
i 've had adults break down and cry 30 to 40 years later because of something that happened in high school			0
" @entity6 likes to hand out " kindness certificates , " so people can frame a visual reminder of the mission of his trip			1
hold the door for someone			0
let everybody go through traffic			0
these are the things @entity6 says he does when he 's on the road and recommends for others			1
a living memorial on this trip to @entity8 , a dozen people from places as far away as @entity190 stopped by his bus to read the messages people left behind			0
" there is a sense of wonder that turns him into a joy , " says sister @entity195 , who lives in @entity196 , @entity197			0
" you come outside and say hello to him , and he 's just so thrilled to see you			0
what can be better ? " there is no heat inside @entity6 's bus -- or air conditioning for that matter -- but the walls are filled with more than 400 messages , written by children and adults who stop by and chat			1
it 's a living memorial , he says , of the people who took the time to write on it			0
but it also speaks to the future , when days are long and he needs a reminder to keep going			0
he likes the simplicity of one note that a 3 - year - old left with the help of his mother : " just be nice			0
" and the wisdom of a 92 - year - old man who was married for 60 years : " tell your love , you love her every day			2
" even on a cold day , @entity6 says , " it warms the soul			1

@entity6 has traveled nearly 60,000 miles across the @entity232 to talk about kindness
after the tragedy of the 2007 @entity39 shootings , he *decided* to change course
he rides with his @entity18 terrier , @entity17 , as company and sometimes bikes
