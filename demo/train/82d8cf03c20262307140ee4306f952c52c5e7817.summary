@entity1 , @entity0 -- when @entity5 - positive @entity4 was invited to speak on the subject at the @entity7 in @entity8 last june , she never expected that her condition would prevent her from obtaining a visa			1
@entity5 positive @entity4 was repeatedly questioned before being allowed into the @entity11			1
@entity4 has been living with the disease for over 20 years			2
preparing for her trip , @entity13 - based @entity4 discovered that the @entity11 was one of 70 countries worldwide that either banned or restricted inbound travel for people with @entity5			1
" i was told i needed to come to the @entity11 embassy for an interview and bring a doctor 's letter stating i was fit to travel , " @entity4 , @entity5 coordinator for charity @entity19 , told @entity2			1
" at first , the embassy told me that the first available appointment for my interview would be at a date past the @entity7 high - level meeting i was meant to attend			0
" only when the @entity7 intervened on @entity4 's behalf was she granted an earlier interview date			0
@entity4 was relieved when she finally received her visa on time			0
but the hurdles were far from over			0
at the airport in @entity8 , @entity4 was detained twice for further questioning			0
" it was so humiliating , " @entity4 said			0
" the immigration officers were asking me very personal questions about my health			2
" a month after @entity4 's ordeal , the @entity40 passed the re-authorization of president @entity43 's @entity44 ( @entity44 ) , including an amendment to the ban on travel and immigration for @entity5 - positive non-citizens			1
but the @entity11 travel ban still remains in effect , and will continue to be the law until the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) modifies its regulations			1
fifty - eight members of @entity56 have sent a letter to the @entity53 , urging them to take action			0
@entity59 also places restrictions on travelers with @entity5			1
affected visitors are not permitted to stay in the country for more than three months			2
anyone applying for a visa for long - term stay must present a certificate stating that they are @entity5 negative			1
the @entity59 embassy 's spokesperson in @entity1 told @entity2 no changes to the ban were currently being considered and declined to comment further			1
crusading against these bans is " @entity75 , " a @entity13 - based organization that attempts to engage youth to combat global and social injustices			0
the organization argues that there is no public health rationale for " restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of hiv status			2
" are these laws outmoded ? what do you think ? tell us in the @entity91 below			0
the fight against stigmas associated with @entity5 and @entity94 has been widely adopted by the organization 's young members			1
many are joining @entity75 's protests across @entity1			0
last week , following two protests at the embassies of @entity102 and @entity103 -- both countries ban @entity5 positive travelers from entering their borders -- the organization launched its third protest in front of the @entity59 embassy in @entity1			1
" the level of proliferation of the hiv virus in countries that do not implement bans on @entity5 travelers is proof that these bans have no impact whatsoever , except for reinforcing the stigma , " said @entity110 , @entity75 's project manager			1
@entity110 told @entity2 that the bans and restrictions further the spread of the epidemic by driving the issue underground and force people to lie about their health on visa applications			1
@entity128 , a 22 - year - old @entity13 rap artist , was also present at the protest			0
" i 'm here because many young people are not aware of these issues , but if they knew these bans existed , they would want to do something about it , " @entity128 explained			2
eighteen - year - old @entity135 agrees			0
@entity136 believes it is bad enough to live with @entity5 and that these regulations make life " even harder			2
" " some people are completely not at fault , they might have gotten the virus through blood transfusion and @entity59 does n't take that into consideration , " @entity136 said			1
" science has moved on from the days where @entity5 was an unknown virus			2
now the world needs to move on too , " @entity4 said			0
" @entity150 remains our biggest challenge			0

@entity59 is one of 11 countries worldwide that restricts @entity5 positive visitors
the @entity11 lifted *similar* ban last july , but has not yet been implemented
protesters argue that ban forces people to lie about health to gain entry
