-- a panel of @entity3 citizens is expected to set the tone thursday for a planned constitutional referendum to better recognize the indigenous population that inhabited the vast continent long before @entity8 settled there			1
the diverse group includes @entity11 leaders , business executives , legal experts and members of the main political parties			1
it spent the past year crisscrossing @entity3 to gather opinions in order to provide recommendations to the government			1
" at the moment , the @entity24 denies that there was a prior presence of @entity11 people in @entity3 , " said @entity21 , an associate professor of history at the @entity23			1
" they 're pretty much invisible			0
" the panel faces a daunting task -- changes by referendum rarely do well in @entity3			1
only eight of the 44 referendum proposals have passed in the country 's history , with the last successful one in 1974			1
" this is a rare , once in a lifetime opportunity if the federal government proceeds to referendum , " @entity37 , director of the @entity38 at the @entity39 and an expert member of the panel said in an e-mail			1
though it appears political parties support a change in the @entity24 , they differ on the details			0
prime minister @entity53 's @entity52 government has said it is committed to holding a referendum on the subject during its current term or at the next general election			1
and the opposition @entity58 has also voiced support for the measure			0
politicians generally agree the existing wording of the @entity24 could be improved			0
" it 's bringing the @entity24 into line with what everyone has pretty much accepted now , " said @entity63 , noting a key @entity65 decision over land rights in 1992 that rejected the notion that @entity3 was " terra nullius , " or " empty land " before the arrival of @entity8 settlers			1
in 2008 , then - prime minister , @entity75 , apologized for the state 's mistreatment of indigenous people in the past , describing it as a " blemished chapter in our nation 's history			1
" but the @entity24 is yet to clearly reflect that , with the original document , which dates to 1901 , a product of its time			0
it took a narrow , 19th - century view of who is defined as a citizen with full rights and gave little thought to @entity94			0
the @entity3 stance was similar to that of other nations such as the @entity98 and @entity99			2
" at that time , it was thought that the @entity11 people would die out , " @entity63 said			2
the indigenous population declined to about 93,000 in 1901 , from between 300,000 and 750,000 in 1788			0
but the population subsequently recovered			0
in the 2006 @entity105 , 455,031 people identified themselves as being of @entity11 or @entity106 descent out of a total national population of more than 21 million			2
a step toward updating the @entity24 was made in 1967 , when more than 90 % of voters approved the removal of two references to @entity11 people that were deemed negative			2
many people feel , however , that the 1967 referendum left some unfinished business			2
while their numbers have increased , indigenous people have struggled to keep pace with the economic gains of the broader @entity3 population			2
" on all the major indicators -- be they economic , social , health or education -- aboriginal people are way behind , " @entity63 said			2
the panel apparently intends to improve the constitutional standing			0
" the prime minister will be told that the @entity24 needs to be changed and that this is backed by a majority of @entity3 , " @entity128 , a professor of law at the @entity39 and a member of the panel , wrote in an opinion article published tuesday in the @entity131 , a daily newspaper			1
there are two provisions that are still considered to have racist connotations : one that allows states to disqualify people of " all persons of any race " from voting at elections ; and another that authorizes parliament to make " special laws " for " the people of any race			0
" the panel is expected to recommend that removal of those two provisions , a move likely to receive broad political support			0
the delicate issue will be how to go about inserting a positive recognition of indigenous people 's status into the document			0
some commentators and politicians fear that any new provision in the @entity24 that actively asserts indigenous australians ' rights to advancement could result in too much power for the courts			0
" any proposal to include in the @entity24 a measure that might open the door to endless litigation and judicial second - guessing of parliamentary decisions about what policies best secure the " advancement " of @entity94 , is not only undesirable in itself , it would surely spell the defeat of the referendum , " @entity166 , a senior official who deals with the @entity58 legal issues , wrote in an opinion piece last month for the @entity3 , a national newspaper			1
but if the proposed changes are too slight , they may disappoint @entity11 leaders and other advocates of more significant measures			1
" positive words and symbolic change will not be enough , " @entity128 said in the @entity131			0
all sides recognize , though , that a lack of bipartisan support will prevent the referendum from succeeding			0
even if the process results in a change that is more symbolic than legally binding , it may still have positive consequences			0
" @entity199 as the first people of @entity3 is a critical step to support the improvement of @entity94 mental health , " the @entity196 wrote in its submission to the panel			1
" the lack of acknowledgment of a people 's existence in a country 's @entity24 has a major impact on their sense of identity , value within the community and perpetuates discrimination and prejudice which further erodes the hope of indigenous people , " the college said .			1
