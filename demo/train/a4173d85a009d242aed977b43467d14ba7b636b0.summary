-- @entity4 , @entity2 's complete do - over of its mobile operating system , is off to a promising start with the @entity6			1
despite a few imperfections with usability and web browsing , the big @entity7 has polished a gem with this os , and it truly shines through this @entity15 lookalike 's beautiful display			1
the @entity16 feels slick and smooth the first time you pick it up			0
it 's a teensy bit longer , wider and thicker than the @entity15 ( 4.84 x 2.56 x 0.39 inches compared with the @entity15 's 4.5 x 2.31 x 0.37 inches )			1
and the @entity16 is lighter at 4.07 ounces , versus the @entity15 's 4.8 ounces			1
holding it in your hand , you can tell the @entity27 phone 's plastic parts are a bit cheaper than @entity30 's luxury glass - and - metal components			1
that 's not to say the @entity16 is n't a sweet device , though : the vivid @entity34 display makes @entity4 's colorful tile - based interface a visual treat			1
selecting a tile brings you into a " hub " containing integrated experiences for different features			1
for example , the @entity42 hub displays the four different software stores where you can purchase media : third - party apps , games , music and @entity49 , a separate app store serving software made by @entity27			1
wired : general download of @entity4 interface you can move tiles around on the home screen to suit your preferences just by holding your finger over them and dragging			1
the tile interface is plenty intuitive , so you probably wo n't need an instruction manual when you 're setting up the phone			1
the @entity63 tile is pretty fun : it blends your contacts list with your @entity68 account			1
when you dial a friend 's number , his or her @entity68 mug appears next to the call			2
selecting a contact brings up the person 's phone number , e-mail address and @entity68 profile all in one screen			2
the mail hub is especially impressive			0
you select your service ( @entity86 , @entity85 , @entity87 and others ) , enter your login info and boom -- the inbox is a tile on your home screen			2
the e-mail app in general looks great : @entity68 integration comes into play here , too , so when you load an e-mail it 's accompanied with the sender 's @entity68 portrait as well			2
to me , this visual experience makes e-mail far less boring			2
for transferring music , photos and video you can sync media from your computer to the @entity16 with a usb cable			0
i tested syncing on a @entity110 the official syncing program for @entity110 users is n't available yet , but i had a chance to try the beta version , and it was surprisingly smooth at syncing music from my @entity116 library and photos and video from @entity119			2
( do n't get your hopes up , though : this is a feature that @entity30 is most likely going to break with future @entity116 updates , just like it did with the @entity124 's @entity116 sync feature			1
) as for snapping photos , there 's a dedicated shutter button on the right side of the phone to load the camera app and to take a picture			2
in the photo hub , you can also enable pictures to automatically sync to a free @entity135 folder stored online in your @entity86 account , sparing you the need to manually upload them			0
overall , this entire camera experience is a lot snappier than photo features on the @entity15 and @entity142 devices			0
however , the pictures shot with the @entity16 's 5 - megapixel camera are only passable , and are a little blurry even in good lighting conditions			1
with all that said , there were a few minor gripes that drove me a bit crazy			0
to wake up the phone , you have to press the physical power button on the right side			0
it feels unnatural to have to grip the phone and push a button on the side whenever you want to quickly check an e-mail or send a text message			0
i wish you could power on the device just by pressing the main menu button , which is centered under the screen -- similar to how you can press the @entity15 's home button to turn it on			2
and then there 's the mobile version of @entity167			2
it 's not as bad as @entity2 's desktop browser , but it 's not much better			1
the mobile browser does n't seem to load text properly on some websites , such as @entity173 and @entity174			1
small text does n't render smoothly , which is evident even when loading @entity176			2
also , photos on some websites appear over-sharpened , making rough pixels become visible			0
long story short , two thumbs down for @entity167			0
oh , yeah -- and just like the @entity15 , there 's no support for @entity184 on @entity4 ( yet ) , so @entity186 junkies wo n't be thrilled			1
the phone seemed more reliable at holding a call than the @entity15 , but it was n't any better at pulling in a signal in areas where @entity193 's coverage is weak ( like @entity195 's @entity194 )			1
my testing was hardly scientific , though			0
texting is surprisingly fast on the @entity16			0
hitting send shoots out a text almost instantly			0
there 's no progress bar or anything			0
why ca n't the @entity15 do that ? overall , the @entity6 is a solid all - around device , and the pros heavily outweigh the cons. most of the listed problems will probably be fixed in software updates			1
and with @entity4 , @entity2 has largely redeemed itself after putting that bloated carcass known as @entity210 to rest			1
rest in peace -- and good riddance -- @entity210			0
@entity0 @entity214 - based ui laced with large , smooth text does n't rip off the @entity15 's app interface			1
provides a rich dose of social savvy thanks to tight @entity68 integration			0
physical camera shutter button is a nice shortcut for shooting quick photos			0
tired internet explorer lives up to its super-lame reputation			0
camera shots too blurry to be taken seriously			0
