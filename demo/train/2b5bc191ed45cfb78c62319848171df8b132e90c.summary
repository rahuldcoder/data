-- private businesses are better placed than governments to tackle global warming because they can act faster , according to panelists at @entity0 's climate change debate			1
high profile figures in the private sector and the @entity8 agreed the urgency to reduce carbon emissions was such that business could not afford to wait for politicians to act			1
@entity13 , executive secretary of the @entity14 , said at the @entity0 @entity17 's @entity16 debate in @entity18 , @entity19 , that business should be " pulling governments along			1
" she said : " the difficult thing is to balance two realities			0
one reality is the urgency of it , which science tells us and we can see and economics has already figured out , with the political pace with which governments can move			0
" that 's where private sector comes in , that 's where private sector , seeing the opportunity , should be not waiting for governments but taking the lead and pulling governments along			2
" @entity13 was joined in the debate by @entity42 , president of @entity19 , and @entity44 , vice chairman of @entity45 , discussing who should pay to combat climate change			1
@entity44 agreed : " the business community is doing this already			2
they see the risk , see the opportunity			0
i think we are ahead because business thinks longer term than politicians			2
" @entity42 , who has pledged to make @entity19 one of the first developing countries to take a lead in combating climate change , said everyone should contribute to avert disaster			1
" we will need a lot of public money , we will need a lot of private money , we will need the market , we will need new rules , we will need taxes			0
" but , in any case , it will be cheaper than to pay the consequences of climate change			1
" he added that all countries should pay according to their circumstances			2
" you have more money , you pay more ; your consumption of carbon is larger than mine , you must pay more ; but the point is everyone is going to pay the consequences , everyone has to contribute			1
" during the debate , hosted by @entity0 anchor @entity88 , @entity44 praised the efforts of @entity19 , @entity90 and other emerging economies in tackling carbon emissions			1
he said : " i think countries like @entity19 and @entity90 have understood that this is compatible with growth , job creation and eradicating poverty			1
" there 's a huge potential for competitive advantage and technological leap - frogging if you go for green growth , if you go for the big transformation that 's coming our way			0
" some call it the next industrial revolution , where you go for much more natural - resource saving generally and low - carbon future growth path			0
" i think @entity19 , @entity90 and other emerging economies are more vigorous than some mature market economies			1
" the panelists discussed the establishment of a global carbon market to make the highest polluters pay for their emissions			1
@entity44 , a member of the @entity8 @entity118 on @entity119 , said this could best be brought in by building on individual country pledges			1
he said : " i 'm skeptical , unfortunately , that we will have in the foreseeable future a global carbon market , but what we will have is domestic schemes spring up			0
we have the @entity128 experience , of course			0
" @entity90 is thinking as part of its next five - year plan about establishing carbon markets and we could link domestic markets , create regional markets and eventually lead back to an international agreement			2
" he added : " we need a carbon price -- get the incentives right and humankind will be very innovative in responding			0
" @entity141 , the environmentalist , speaking to @entity0 separately , said a country 's individual circumstances need to be taken into account instead of trying to impose a one - size - fits - all solution			0
he said : " if we really want to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels , if we really want to change technology , we really need to do it country by country , or perhaps bilateral agreements among countries that have similar circumstances			2
" one of the main reasons that @entity159 has failed is that every country is different , some countries are rich , some countries are poor			0
" he added : " how can you expect countries as disparate as this to have some kind of common cookie - cutter agreement on what everyone is supposed to do ? it 's impossible			0
