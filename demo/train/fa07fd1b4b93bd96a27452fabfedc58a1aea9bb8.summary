@entity0 -- the @entity2 agreed monday to review whether a federal law outlawing the sale of graphic videos of animal cruelty amounts to a violation of free - speech rights			1
the @entity2 will hear a case on dogfighting , which usually involves pit bulls , shelter statistics say			1
the justices accepted the @entity15 appeal of a case dealing with a tape showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations			1
a federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of @entity24 , a @entity25 man who sold videos through his " @entity28 " business			1
according to court records , undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in " @entity33 , " an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting			0
among the products @entity24 advertised was " @entity46 , " featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a " gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig , " according to the @entity45 - based appeals court			2

he was later sentenced to 37 months in prison , and promptly appealed			0
it was the first prosecution in the @entity52 to proceed to trial under the decade - old law			0
the divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question , " research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty			0
" the court noted many state and local jurisdictions have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals			0
the government had argued a " compelling interest " in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions			1
growing in popularity are what are called " crush " videos , in which women , with their faces unseen , are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked - heel shoes or with their bare feet			2
