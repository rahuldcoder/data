-- a manufacturer that has been inscribing @entity3 references on rifle sights used by @entity6 troops in @entity7 and @entity8 announced thursday that it will stop putting scripture references on products the @entity6 military uses			1
gen. @entity12 , commander of @entity13 , said wednesday -- apparently before learning of the company 's announcement -- that the references were a " big concern " to the @entity18 and the @entity19 , which have contracts for the scopes			1
" i hope you can sense ... this is of serious concern to me and the other commanders in @entity7 and @entity8 because it can indeed create a perception that is absolutely contrary to what it is that we have sought to do , " he said			0
he said @entity6 troops are much more sensitive " about this kind of thing , " apparently , than is the contractor involved			2
on its web site wednesday , the @entity35 said the references " feed into the violent extremists ' narrative that the ongoing wars in @entity8 and @entity7 are a ' crusade against @entity41			1
' " @entity43 , the manufacturer , said in a written statement that it has " offered to voluntarily stop putting references to scripture on all products manufactured for the @entity6 military -- and will provide , free of charge , 100 modification kits to the @entity51 to enable the removal of the references that are already on products that are currently deployed			1
" there was no immediate reaction from the @entity51 in response to the announcement , but a response was being prepared , maj. @entity60 in the @entity51 's public affairs office told @entity0			0
the @entity19 said it was " concerned " when it learned about the biblical references			2
" we are making every effort to remove these markings from all of our scopes and will ensure that all future procurement of these scopes will not have these types of markings , " it said in a written statement			0
" we will remove the markings from the scopes currently delivered			0
@entity43 will also remove the markings from all scopes that have not been delivered			2
" earlier , after it emerged that the @entity79 - based manufacturer was putting codes for scriptures on the scopes , @entity43 issued a statement saying that it has put scripture references on its products for more than two decades			1
" as long as we have men and women in danger , we will continue to do everything we can to provide them with both state - of - the - art technology and the never - ending support and prayers of a grateful nation , " it said wednesday			0
@entity94 first reported the story on monday , saying that some of the citations on the sights included " @entity99 , " an apparent reference to 2 @entity101 of the @entity102 , which reads , " for @entity106 , who said , ' let light shine out of darkness , ' made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of @entity106 in the face of @entity113			0
" another , according to @entity94 , included @entity115 : 12 , apparently referring to @entity116			0
that reads , " when @entity119 spoke again to the people , he said , ' @entity116			0
whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life			0
' " @entity43 has a $ 660 million contract for the @entity19 and the @entity18 , according to @entity60			1
he said slightly more than 300,000 scopes have been delivered so far , with most going to the @entity19			2
after the initial news report , the @entity35 called on defense secretary @entity130 to withdraw from combat use weapons that have sights with the biblical references			2
" allowing religious references to be placed on @entity6 weaponry , which are bought and paid for by @entity6 taxpayers , is unacceptable , " @entity35 executive director @entity134 wrote in a letter to @entity130 , according to the council 's web site			1
" such inscriptions not only run afoul of the @entity142 and @entity6 military rules , but they also feed into the violent extremists ' narrative that the ongoing wars in @entity8 and @entity7 are a ' crusade against @entity41			1

@entity43 offers not to put them on new scopes , alteration kits for deployed ones
inscriptions feed into the narrative that @entity6 is against @entity41 , @entity35 group says
@entity158 says it 's been putting such references on its products for more than two decades
@entity43 has a $ 660 million contract for @entity19 , @entity18 , defense official says
