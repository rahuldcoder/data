@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has come to this remote swath of @entity1 desert to say goodbye			1
to his brother , @entity6			1
his sister - in - law , @entity7			0
his two nephews , 4 - year - old @entity9 and 3 - year - old @entity10 all four ended up here , in an unincorporated area north of @entity0 , in a pair of shallow graves , for reasons no one has been able to explain			0
there 's no bringing them back			2
but @entity3 promises they will get justice , once their killers are found			1
" you guys are cowards , " he said			0
" and all of @entity23 is coming after you			0
and we 're going to find you			1
and we 're going to prosecute you			2
" if and when authorities track the person or people responsible down , as they 're taken through the criminal justice system , they will have company			2
@entity3 vows : " i 'm going to be there every step of the way			1
and i 'm going to be there when you meet your fate			0
" so who are the culprits ? why did they kill the @entity41 ? and how did they end up here -- the husband and wife in one grave , their two sons in the other -- their bones visible in the dirt to a motorcycle rider going through ? all good questions without answers , officially at least			2
in february 2010 , the @entity41 had a busy but seemingly happy life in @entity55 , a community of about 30,000 people about 18 miles from the @entity58 and 50 miles north of @entity59			1
in addition to chasing after their two little boys , @entity63 -- who married three years earlier -- were remodeling their home			1
" they were happy , " @entity3 told @entity66 's @entity65 earlier this month			1
" and that 's part of the mystery			2
" the last documented sighting of them was february 4 , 2010			1
the family 's locked , abandoned @entity73 was located four days later in @entity74 , @entity1 , having been towed from the @entity76 border			1
did they cross over ? surveillance video taken that night shows a family fitting the description of the @entity41 walking into @entity76			1
but it has never been confirmed it was them			0
or , if it was , that they ever came back			0
@entity3 , for one , says he does n't believe this video shows his brother			1
" that 's certainly part of this huge puzzle , " @entity89 spokeswoman @entity88 said of reports that the family crossed into @entity76 and ate dinner and drank cocktails there			1
" what happened here ? was that part staged ? did they actually cross into @entity76 ? " @entity88 added , " we still think that there 's a strong possibility that they did			1
when did they come back ? were they under duress ? i mean , these are all questions that we we want to find out			2
" on february 15 , relatives called the sheriff 's department to report the family missing			1
at the home , there were eggs on the kitchen counter , bowls of popcorn in the living room , and two dogs			2
but no trace of the @entity41			0
the next three years were filled with speculation , fear and hope			0
@entity126 published a book , " @entity130 , " on their plight			0
@entity3 and other family members tried to keep the case alive			1
then came the call to the @entity135 sheriff - coroner @entity89 around 10 a.m. on november 11			0
a motorcyclist said he had spotted skeletal remains in a sandy , scrubby @entity139 area between @entity140 and @entity141 - 15 , the highway @entity142 take to get to and from @entity144			1
otherwise , though , it could well have been considered the middle of nowhere -- some 105 miles north of the @entity147 's hometown of @entity55 , and 160 miles north of @entity74			1
four days later , the sheriff 's identified the victims as the @entity41			0
the @entity150 has deemed their deaths homicides , but it did not give a cause in order " to protect the investigation			0
" " every available resource will be utilized in this investigation to identify the suspects involved in this heinous crime and bring them to justice , " said sheriff @entity155			0
their bones gone , large crosses now mark the spot where the @entity41 ended up			0
approaching their makeshift grave for the first time , @entity3 said what he sees indicates to him that the guilty party knew what they were doing			2
" you see how this is kind of sunken down ? " he said			0
" it gives you a little cover from the road			0
somebody had to know the area , had to know you needed a four - wheel drive			0
" couple lost on snow - covered road writes goodbye letters , prepared to die @entity2 's @entity184 reported from north of @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity2 's @entity185 reported and wrote this story from @entity187 .			2

@entity6 , his wife and their two boys were reported missing in february 2010
their *car* was found near the @entity76 border ; their home offered few clues
a motorcyclist saw their remains this month in desert 100 miles from their home
@entity3 's brother promises the family 's killers : " we 're going to find you "
