-- it was little surprise that @entity3 described the end of his career as " perfect			1
" even the @entity7 scriptwriters down the road would have struggled to come up with a more fitting finale for the man many acclaim as the greatest footballer in @entity14 history			0
on sunday , the player with a record goal tally in the @entity17 -- and for the @entity14 national team as well -- left the pitch for a final time , with yet another trophy and a very last record as well			1
as @entity24 beat the luckless @entity25 2 - 1 in sunday 's @entity27 final , the 32 - year - old won the tournament for a record sixth time			1
as sporting farewells go , it was near perfect			2
even more so given earlier this year @entity3 had been controversially left out of the @entity14 @entity33 squad by coach @entity34			1
in august , the pressure increased a notch after @entity3 revealed that the current season would be his last , declaring his desire to " pursue other opportunities that will challenge me and allow me to grow as a person			1
" at the time , there was no way of knowing that @entity24 were once again on the way to the title , their third in four years			1
nor that the season - ending finale would come at the @entity46 , the stadium he has called home for the last decade ( with @entity24 's home advantage coming courtesy of winning more points during the regular season )			1
neither could he known that after @entity24 's @entity56 and the @entity25 's @entity57 traded goals , there would be the drama of an extra-time winner as @entity61 slotted home in the final period of @entity3 's career			1
his sixth cup took him clear of @entity68 and current @entity67 midfielder @entity66 , both of whom boast five championships			2
" it 's a dream to finish like this , " @entity24 's brightest star said in his post-match press conference			1
" for me , it 's perfect			2
all my family , more than 80 of my friends and family , were in the stadium and it 's a perfect day because they know what we have gone through in the last 16 years -- and all are very happy			2
" with fans waving banners saying ' thank you ' and ' in @entity87 ' in the stands , @entity3 -- who had a relatively quiet game -- only dared to believe in the perfect finish with just nine minutes left , after @entity61 punished slack defending			1
" when we scored the second goal , i began to think that we were going to win another championship , " said the @entity93 , who ventured that @entity25 , who have now lost all five @entity27 finals , were better for much of the game			1
filling the void a man who spent time on loan at @entity102 ( 2009 ) and @entity103 ( 2010 & 2012 ) in his career also admitted that he will struggle to replace the drama of his old career as he looks to pastures new			2
" there is no experience like what just happened , " he said			0
" if you work a desk job or a nine - to - five job there is no real experience where you get to feel that			2
" i ca n't imagine anything coming close to that in my life going forward so i am going to miss that greatly			0
" i think that is why a lot of athletes struggle after they retire , you ca n't get that back			0
i have to be aware of that and find other things that i am passionate about			0
" @entity3 's @entity17 debut came in 2001 , for @entity129 , and he promptly won the championship in his first season -- before winning a second in 2003			1
the triumphs were achieved while on loan from @entity135 , the @entity136 side he left in 2005 to join @entity24			2
the highest @entity33 goalscorer in @entity14 history would promptly win a title that season as well , adding further silverware in 2011 , 2012 and then this year as well			1
as he admitted this week , he started out in an @entity17 league that was vastly different to today 's offering -- which has been graced by @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity61 in recent years , while players such as @entity147 and @entity33 winner @entity148 are arriving next year			2
where once matches were played in stadiums owned by gridiron teams and which were seldom filled , now large crowds in new purpose - built football arenas are the norm			0
" i 'm excited , i 'm pretty exhausted to be honest , " said @entity3 while he celebrated on the pitch one last time			1
" i 'm so proud , so happy for our guys			0
as you get older , you realise how difficult this is , so to have this moment is really special for us			0
" tomorrow , i can think of other things -- at the moment , i am happy and in the moment of winning this cup , " he added later			0
@entity168 ' joy sunday 's match also completed a remarkable journey for @entity24 's @entity168			1
in february 2013 , the defender came out as gay and duly quit football at the same time			0
three months later , he became the first openly gay man to play in an @entity14 sports league after joining @entity24			1
now he has a second @entity17 trophy in the bag , having failed to fully celebrate his first title with the @entity179			0
" i could n't even enjoy it -- i remember just being alright it , " he told the official @entity17 website			0
" i 'm such a different person ( now ) , " the 27 - year - old told reporters			1
" i ca n't explain it			0
it 's been a difficult but amazing journey			0
" in no small part thanks to donovan himself			0
" for me personally , @entity3 was one of the guys that helped me get back into the game , " @entity168 said			1
" he 's been a supporter of mine throughout my career and i 've always looked up to him			2
" to let him go on this vacation , start the adventure of his new life and figure out what he wants to do , i 'm just so happy he can leave the @entity24 with his head held extremely high			2
' greatest player in @entity14 soccer history ' " he 's the best player for @entity14 soccer ever and in this league , and has done so much			0
to get him the extra silverware , i 'm just very proud of the team and i 'm happy i was able to share it with him			0
" with 144 goals and a record 136 assists in the @entity17 , as well as an unsurpassed 57 strikes for the national team , @entity3 leaves with a widespread reputation as the finest @entity14 player in history			1
one that was endorsed by @entity24 head coach @entity215 , the man who led the @entity14 to the quarterfinals of the 2002 @entity33 , when @entity3 won the ' @entity218 ' award			1
he would also play at the @entity33 in 2006 and 2010 , when he scored a dramatic goal that enabled the @entity14 to top their group , and won four @entity222 ( 2002 , 2005 , 2007 , 2013 )			0
" do n't we all wish to be able to leave what we do like the way @entity3 did today as a winner ? can you write that any better , that script ? " @entity229 asked			2
" i 'm happy for him			0
he 's spent , he 's done , and my hat is off to him			0
" yet @entity229 's comments before the match better capture the underlying reasons for the enduring popularity of the departing @entity3			1
" i would think his legacy is that he left the game as the greatest player in the history of @entity243 , and he 's a damn good person			0
that 's a pretty good legacy			0
