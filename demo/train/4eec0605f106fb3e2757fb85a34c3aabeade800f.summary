-- after more than a dozen trips to the @entity2 and 14 months of unbridled optimism on the prospects for peace in the region and his own ability to negotiate it , @entity10 on friday finally sounded defeated			1
while @entity10 has made the peace process his priority since taking office , his focus has been challenged by the civil war in @entity17 , nuclear negotiations with @entity19 and , now , @entity21 moves against @entity22			1
he acknowledged the @entity25 - @entity24 conflict was still a global concern , but that the @entity27 had a full agenda			2
" we have an enormous amount on the plate , " he said , adding what were possibly the toughest comments he has made about the parties ' intransigence			0
" there are limits to the amount of time and effort that the @entity27 can spend if the parties themselves are unwilling to take constructive steps in order to be able to move forward , " @entity10 said			1
the past week was particularly frustrating for @entity10			2
@entity25 reneged on a scheduled release of @entity24 prisoners and the @entity24 responded by signing on to join 15 international bodies in defiance of their own commitment not to seek international recognition as a state			0
@entity10 blindly stated the obvious when he called both moves " not helpful			2
" since beginning his peace mission , @entity10 's lofty goals have become significantly more modest			1
in july , he announced a bid to reach a peace deal within nine months			2
but as time rolled by with little progress , @entity10 sought to get @entity25 prime minister @entity60 and @entity24 president @entity61 to agree to a framework , which would form the basis for a comprehensive peace treaty			1
with the deadline set to expire on april 29 , @entity10 and his aides have struggled to get the parties to extend the talks , even putting the potential release of @entity25 spy @entity70 on the table to secure the @entity24 prisoner release			1
@entity10 said " neither party has said that they 've called it off			0
" and one @entity24 source close to the negotiations told @entity0 's @entity77 that @entity24 were still committed to the talks until the april deadline			1
after that , he said , " we are free			0
" neither of those are ringing endorsements			0
even if both sides are willing to mark time for another month , it 's clear the peace process is on life support			0
while @entity10 is n't ready to pull the plug entirely , he said the @entity27 would " evaluate what is possible and what is not possible , " suggesting @entity91 may recalibrate its role as broker of the peace process as a result			1
" we 're not going to sit there indefinitely			0
this is not an open - ended effort , " @entity10 said friday in @entity99			0
" it 's reality check time			0

@entity10 had high hopes of deal in announcing talks nine months *ago*
he has made more than a dozen trips to the region to facilitate negotiations
he had been optimistic , but now he sounds resigned with deadline for progress fast *approaching*
@entity10 says the @entity27 will now evaluate what 's " possible and what is not possible "
