-- as @entity2 count the votes following the first parliamentary elections since @entity6 troops withdrew from the country at the end of 2011 , they agree on one thing : the fierce urgency of change			1
although the vote is an important milestone in @entity16 's fragile state , it is unlikely to resolve the country 's severe political crisis and generate a new social contract and a constitution that enshrine equal citizenship before the rule of law			1
at the heart of @entity16 's structural crisis lies a dysfunctional political system based on muhasasa or distribution of power along communal , ethnic and tribal lines , a system put in place after the @entity6 invaded and occupied the country in 2003			1
ever since , the dominant social groups have fought over the division of political spoils , unwilling to put the interests of the nation over their own sects and tribes			1
although the rules of the game influence the conduct of the political class , politicians of all colors ( @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 ) have not transcended their narrow parochial concerns and have not risen up to the historic challenge			0
@entity16 faces a two - pronged systemic and leadership challenge			1
the ruling political class is as much responsible for @entity16 's predicament as structural conditions			1
the structure is not destiny			0
having taken ownership of the country after @entity6 occupation and ouster of @entity63 , the @entity42 leadership has treated @entity43 like second - class citizens and has equated its numerical majority with a license to monopolize power at the expense of others			1
in a similar vein , the @entity43 leadership has not come to terms with the new realities of @entity16 and still entertains illusions about ruling @entity16			1
@entity76 leaders would not mind if @entity16 burns as long as they preserve a separate @entity77 -- a quasi-independent entity			2
of all actors , prime minister @entity79 bears greater responsibility for the steep deterioration of the security situation and the quality of life of @entity2 , including corruption that infects all aspects of @entity2 society			2
after eight years in office and monopolizing power , @entity79 has failed his countrymen and has delivered neither security nor prosperity			0
he was blind and deaf to the gathering storm among @entity95 who feel excluded by what they view as his sectarian - based policies			0
under his watch , @entity100 factions -- or the @entity101 in @entity16 and @entity102 ( @entity103 ) known by its @entity105 acronym , " @entity106 " -- has revived and found shelter among dissatisfied @entity95			2
indeed , @entity16 is deeply polarized along social , ideological and communal lines , witnessing a resilient @entity43 insurgency in late 2012 that has exacted a heavy human toll and has almost plunged the country to the brink of civil war			1
since last may , almost 1,000 civilians get killed each month and the insurgents , a mix of tribesmen and @entity100 extremists , control neighborhoods of the provincial capital , @entity122 , and nearly all of the nearby city of @entity124			0
the conflict in @entity103 has aggravated communal tensions in @entity16 and polarized the country further			2
it is now almost forgotten that the @entity101 in @entity16 and @entity102 established @entity129 in @entity103 , @entity100 's official arm , and built a potent jihadist infrastructure in the war - torn country			2
the two insurgencies in @entity103 and @entity16 feed on one another and supply the fuel that powers their deadly engines			2
yet @entity79 , who leads the mainly @entity138 , is shamelessly running on a triumphant slogan presenting himself as a strong @entity42 leader who can defeat @entity100			0
" together , we defeat terrorism " , one of his campaign posters declares			0
instead of pledging to form a genuine national unity government that tackles @entity16 's structural problems , @entity79 is also asking voters to give him an absolute majority to form a stronger central rule , as if he has not already accumulated too much power , blaming weak governance on political rivals who blocked his efforts			1
" partnership with other political factions has hampered the government performance , " @entity79 told his supporters during a campaign rally in @entity157 south of @entity158			0
it is doubtful if either @entity79 's coalition or any other would gain an outright electoral majority because of the extent of inter- and intra-communal fragmentation			0
more than 9,000 candidates from nearly 280 political entities are vying for 328 seats in parliament			0
not unlike the last parliamentary vote in 2010 , intra-sectarian @entity42 rivalries mark this round			0
the prime minister 's bloc is challenged by @entity176 , led by @entity177 of the @entity178 , @entity177 , and the @entity179 , formed by followers of the @entity182 populist @entity181			0
although in 2010 @entity184 played a key role in convincing @entity186 and @entity187 to back @entity79 and provide him with a majority to form a government , it might not be able to do so now given that the gulf among the three reluctant @entity42 allies has widened			0
@entity43 are as divided as the @entity42			0
in a consolidated democracy , electoral division would produce a broadly - based coalition government			0
not so in @entity16 's case , a fragile country with deep sociological rifts , dysfunctional political system , and absence of a viable progressive non-sectarian alternative			1
far from beginning the complex process of nation - building and social reconstruction , an urgent task , the vote would likely prolong the crisis of authority and legitimation			1
many @entity2 whom i speak to say they have low expectations of the vote ; they are cynical about the politicians who promise deliverance but fall far too short			1
i have not met a single @entity2 who believes that the elections would signal either a new beginning , a different direction , or inject fresh blood in the veins of the cloaked body politic			2
rather more modestly , @entity2 hope that the new leadership will prevent the country from sliding to all - out war and putting its house in order			2
