if republicans do n't wield their congressional majority next year to pass immigration reform legislation , a @entity6 takeover of the @entity7 in 2016 will be " difficult , if not impossible , " sen. @entity0 of @entity1 said during a @entity9 interview released on sunday			1
@entity0 , a @entity6 who has long - favored comprehensive immigration reform , said he believes the @entity6 has hurt itself with @entity13 voters due to its resistance to reforming the current system			1
and without a major change , @entity16 will get another four years in the @entity18 , @entity0 told @entity9 's @entity19 on " @entity20			2
" " if we do n't at least make a down payment on solving the problem and rationally dealing with the 11 million [ illegal immigrants believed to be in the @entity25 ] , if we become the party of self - deportation in 2015 and 2016 , then the chance of winning the @entity7 i think is almost non-existent , " he said			1
but @entity0 , who is mulling a 2016 presidential run , slammed president @entity32 's executive action last month to safeguard as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants			2
he accused the president of " acting in a rogue fashion " for " political reasons			0
" republicans , though , need to " do more than just fight the executive order , " he added			0
@entity0 supports giving a pathway to citizenship to the so - called @entity40 -- undocumented immigrants who crossed into the @entity25 illegally as children and have lived in the @entity25 since			2
and in 2014 , @entity0 showed the political viability of his position by successfully beating back a tough primary challenge in his conservative state by reaffirming -- rather than running away from -- his stance on immigration			2
" if the @entity6 can not muster the political courage to deal with the @entity40 children in a fair and balanced way after we secure our border , that says a a lot about the @entity6 's future regarding the @entity13 community , " @entity0 said			1
" i do n't believe most @entity25 would fault the @entity6 if we allowed children who have been here since they 're babies to assimilate into society with a pathway to citizenship after we secure our borders			2
" @entity0 was one of the most ardent supporters of a bipartisan immigration bill he helped negotiate in 2013 that passed the @entity68 but did not get a vote in the @entity7			1
the bill would have bolstered border security and created a path to citizenship for millions -- many of whom are now getting temporary relief under @entity32 's executive action			0
and while @entity0 's name did n't make the cut in the latest @entity9 / @entity84 poll , another candidate who supports immigration reform is leading a crowded field of potential @entity6 presidential candidates			1
former @entity88 gov. @entity87 snagged 23 % of @entity6 support in the survey released sunday			0
while @entity0 said @entity87 would be " an excellent candidate " who could win the presidency in 2016 , he insisted the race for the @entity6 nomination is still " wide open			1
" related : @entity87 says he has ' no problem ' defending expanding immigration " it 's like preseason polling in football			0
you really do n't know , do the pads connect ? but i think it 's good news for @entity87 at least initially , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 has n't yet decided on a 2016 run , which he will consider more seriously next year , but he did tout his " unique " qualifications to be president in a period of tumultuous global affairs			1
" i think over the last several years i 've been more right than wrong when it comes to foreign policy , that the next @entity112 has got a world on fire , " @entity0 said			0
" i think i have a unique capability to do things like that			0
" @entity0 suspects @entity118 involved in @entity120 attack			0

sen. @entity0 says @entity6 need to tackle immigration reform in order to win the @entity7 in 2016
he has not yet decided if he will make a bid for the @entity6 nomination
