-- it was the 2013 @entity4 , " our president 's now infamous line : " if you like your health care plan , you can keep it			2
" now all @entity8 are realizing what @entity9 have known from the beginning : president @entity12 is a master of deception			1
lest people forget , passage of the @entity15 happened in part because @entity12 struck a deal with a single @entity20 holdout : @entity21 , @entity22			1
@entity21 agreed to vote for the bill in exchange for an executive order protecting conscience rights and preserving the @entity28 's ban on the use of federal funds for abortion			1
@entity21 had insisted on an amendment			0
instead , he took the president 's word			0
the president turned around and stuck in the knife : he used the @entity15 to mandate that all employers , regardless of religious objection , pay for and provide what many of us in the anti-abortion movement consider abortion drugs in their health care plans			1
now , those mandates go into effect for most religiously affiliated charities in just a few days , on january 1			0
@entity47 to take up @entity15 contraception case this came after the president assured @entity9 in his commencement address at @entity52 that he would " honor the conscience of those that disagree with abortion and draft a sensible conscience clause " and after assuring @entity58 that " under our plan , no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions , and federal conscience protections will remain in place			1
" in speaking to @entity8 's pre-eminent @entity20 university , it was as if the president was speaking to @entity8 @entity9 everywhere			1
yet it 's now clear that the promised separate accounts for abortion coverage funded by separate abortion premiums billed directly to the insured were not what they appeared to be , and the president is facing one of the largest religious liberty lawsuits in @entity8 history			1
the lawsuit now boasts more than 200 plaintiffs , one recent addition of note being the @entity80 , an order of nuns that cares for the impoverished and dying elderly			0
cases from the for - profit sector have already reached the @entity47 , and in just a few days , the mandate goes into effect for religious charities			0
in the words of @entity21 , " i am perplexed and disappointed that , having negotiated the executive order with the president , not only does that @entity91 mandate violate the executive order , but it also violates statutory law			0
i think it is illegal			0
" splice and dice it how you like			0
some say @entity15 mandates and subsidizes abortion coverage with taxpayer dollars			1
under the provisions of the @entity15 , abortion drugs such as @entity106 , or @entity106 , are not covered or mandated			2
however , drugs known as " morning after " or " week after " pills that delay ovulation â € ” such as @entity111 and " ella " â € ” are covered under @entity15			2
some of these forms of contraception -- in particular " ella " or ulipristal acetate -- carry @entity118 labels that include a warning that they can destroy embryos by rendering the endometrium inhospitable			0
it is these drugs that are in debate in the @entity125 case and others before the @entity47 , as objectors consider the destruction of an embryo to be an abortion			0
some @entity8 catholics feel that the president deceived the most high - ranking @entity20 in @entity8 , cardinal @entity133 , then the president of the @entity134			2
in a now infamous meeting at the @entity137 , the president promised @entity133 that he would respect the conscience rights of @entity9 and their institutions and would not force them to cover things such as abortifacients -- a drug or substance that can induce an abortion -- and that the administration would change its policy with regard to religious institutions			1
@entity133 has made it clear that he felt misled			0
what many @entity8 catholics do n't know is that the president told the same untruth to the previous @entity154 himself			2
according to a @entity157 insider , the president assured pope @entity158 in 2009 that constitutional religious liberty protections for @entity8 @entity9 would remain strong in his first breath when visiting the @entity157			1
since then , @entity133 has become the face of @entity20 opposition to the mandate			0
under his bold shepherding , the entire conference of @entity20 bishops has held firm in defending the conscience rights of religious employers			1
he has led the @entity9 in @entity8 through one of the most appalling and puzzling periods of deception and legal harassment since the @entity173 became the law of the land			1
as archbishop @entity176 of @entity177 steps into his shoes , he has the daunting task of trying to negotiate religious liberty with a leader who excels in equivocation right as the mandate finally takes effect for scores of @entity20 and other religious charities facing enormous fines for refusing to comply			0
so this @entity191 , as @entity8 put away the glitter and the tinsel , perhaps people will finally realize what some @entity9 have been saying all along : our president threw quite a party , but it 's over			1
and now the truth sets in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity199 : @entity9 knew @entity12 was deceptive ; now rest of @entity8 knows
she says @entity12 went back on his word regarding conscience rights and types of birth control
her bottom line : @entity15 subsidizes abortion pill coverage with taxpayer dollars
