@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's @entity3 opens june 15 at @entity5 , and it 's big , bold and amazing			1
as @entity8 says , " if i 'm lying , i 'm crying			2
" kids of all ages will rev their engines and step on the gas			2
@entity3 is the capstone of a five year , estimated $ 1.1 billion dollar reimagining of @entity5			1
while @entity3 shifts @entity5 into the fast lane , only time will tell if it will save the town ( as @entity17 did for @entity18 ) and turn @entity19 into the world - class destination it aspires to be			1
no doubt the top dogs at @entity4 hope the renewed focus on movie magic will mean magic for the resort that executives have admitted is not up to brand standards			1
@entity3 is the centerpiece to the relaunch of @entity5			1
during the past five years , @entity4 has added more than 20 attractions , including @entity32 and @entity34 rides , upgraded hotels and new shops			1
the upgrades are important considering a big complaint about @entity5 was that the attractions did n't measure up to other @entity4 parks			1
it did n't have enough of the @entity4 magic : strong themes , characters and stories			1
perhaps the main problem was that @entity5 was too nostalgic for the @entity1 of yesteryear , especially @entity49			2
@entity50 does n't appeal to the younger audience			2
the makeover embraces the movie icons the younger generation has grown up with			1
considering that @entity4 is rumored to have spent more for the relaunch than it cost to build the original park ( which opened in 2001 and cost approximately $ 1 billion ) , everyone 's expectations are going to be high			1
along with @entity3 , other changes being unveiled on june 15 include the addition of @entity61 , the new entrance to the park and a nostalgic look at @entity64 in the 1920s and 1930s , when @entity4 arrived			1
again , it 's not just nostalgic , but connected to the movies			1
the park 's icon has changed from @entity70 ( a man - made mountain in the shape of a @entity76 , @entity1 's state animal ) to the @entity78 , the theater where " @entity75 " debuted in 1937			1
" cars " itself is a movie about nostalgia			1
good old @entity82 with its zany cast of characters changes the brash @entity17 into a racer with heart			2
@entity3 invites guests to cruise low and slow down the main street of @entity18			1
thankfully this is the version lightning repaved			2
the major attraction is @entity92 , but fans will also love @entity94 and @entity8 's @entity95			2
the estimated $ 200 million @entity92 ride is a giant slot car system that also features elements that take place in the dark			1
the cars are electric , and work much like a gigantic version of the slot cars kids play with			2
this is the same technology that powers @entity107 , an @entity109 ride			0
after boarding the six - person car , you take a leisurely , scenic tour of @entity113			0
soon you enter a nighttime section , where you 'll find old friends from @entity18 and have adventures including tractor tipping with @entity8			0
next , after an upgrade of tires or paint , and a quick visit to @entity123 , your crew chief , the ride turns into a thrilling race for @entity126 glory			0
@entity4 has brewed a potent mixture here , a cross between the animated character fun of @entity131 's flight with the thrilling excitement of a 40 mph race through the desert			1
the scariest ( and most fun ! ) part was when the car plunged through a wall of fog			0
this ride is destined to have long lines for years to come			0
( my kids went crazy , then immediately demanded to ride again			0
) though not as thrilling as @entity92 , @entity94 is still unlike anything you 've ever ridden , unless you happened to ride @entity146 at @entity19 between 1961 and 1966			0
or you have shrunken down and ridden on an air hockey puck			0
in this update of the @entity146 concept , giant tires float on a cushion of air supplied by a bunch of small air jets			0
riders lean to make their tires move			0
adding to the fun is a bunch of beach balls that riders can run into , poke and bat at each other			0
( thumbs up from the kids			0
) riders of @entity8 's @entity95 sit in a cart mounted to a baby tractor and the tractors square dance to seven songs sung by @entity8 himself			2
( a simple ride , but it got big smiles from the kids )			0
@entity3 spends a lot of time on the little details , including funny set decoration			1
there is excitement enough for the kids and humor for the parents			0
also , @entity3 embraces an important " cars " cast member that people forget , @entity18 itself			1
the movie would n't be the same without @entity82 , @entity188 or the @entity189			2
cars land really embraces the scenery , right down to the blinking stoplight			0
as @entity196 says in maybe the most poignant line in " cars , " " well , the road did n't cut through the land like that interstate			0
it moved with the land , it rose , it fell , it curved			0
cars did n't drive on it to make great time			0
they drove on it to have a great time			0
" @entity4 seems to be taking this to heart .			1

updates to @entity4 's @entity207 open june 15
the centerpiece , @entity3 , makes the most of the *popular* movie
*revamping* the park cost an estimated $ 1.1 billion
