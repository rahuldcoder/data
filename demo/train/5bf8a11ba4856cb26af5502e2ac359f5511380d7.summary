-- @entity1 finally had reason to smile at the @entity3 , winning the 13th stage to make up ground on @entity6 in the race for the green jersey			1
but @entity1 's fellow @entity9 , @entity10 , did n't have as good of a day since main rival @entity11 cut into his overall lead			1
" it was a difficult stage , it was a nervous stage , but finally i 'm so excited to win , " said @entity1			1
" it 's been a difficult few days and it 's nice to be on the podium again			0
" @entity1 , who won his second stage this year and 25th all time , became embroiled in controversy tuesday when he collided with @entity20 as part of a sprint finish			1
although he was cleared by race officials , @entity20 heavily criticized @entity1 and called for him to be thrown out of cycling 's most prestigious race			1
@entity1 was then sprayed with urine by a fan as the difficult days continued and edged by @entity28 on thursday in another sprint finish after seemingly looking in control			2
on friday , though , @entity1 cruised past @entity6 at the finish line			1
he was part of a group of racers who broke away from the pack -- @entity11 included -- with about 18 miles of the relatively flat 107 - mile stage remaining			2
@entity1 said his @entity38 teammates carried him throughout the stage			2
" they gave everything for me yesterday and i let them down , " said @entity1 , now 84 points behind @entity41 's @entity6			1
" today i just sat there while eight guys rode until their legs fell off			0
" i did n't really do anything today			0
i just crossed the finish line first			0
in the end it was just @entity6 and myself			2
i was really happy to beat him			0
" @entity53 was unable to keep pace with the breakaway pack as crosswinds became a factor , leaving @entity10 behind two - time race winner @entity11			1
@entity10 did n't benefit from the support of @entity60 , who was ruled out of the tour after breaking his shoulder thursday			2
" i desperately wanted to get on to the @entity11 move but i was sitting a little too far back , " said @entity10			1
" i was just behind @entity1 's wheel when he sprinted across			2
" i think he was the last guy to get across and again it 's another reminder that this race is 100 percent open and that there is still everything to race for			0
" his lead of three minutes , 25 seconds shrunk , although it was n't @entity70 in second			0
the @entity73 rider slipped to 16th overall when he collided with another racer and damaged a wheel			0
@entity77 @entity76 moved into second , 2:28 behind @entity10 , and @entity79 's @entity11 shaved a minute off @entity10 's advantage to pull to within 2:45			1
" i knew i had a really good buffer already -- almost four minutes on @entity11 , " said @entity10			1
" and okay , i worked really hard to get that time gap but you ca n't win them all			0
" it was a really tough day			0
i do n't think anyone was expecting it to be this hard			0
" on paper it was a flat day and it should have been a bunch sprint but with those crosswinds it definitely made the race a lot more exciting			0
