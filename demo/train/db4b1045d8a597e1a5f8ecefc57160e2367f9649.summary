-- @entity1 is investing in its infrastructure , and travelers know the results are breathtaking			0
with the @entity7 tunnel , trains speed from @entity8 to the @entity9 in about 2.5 hours			1
you zip under the @entity7 in 20 minutes ... looking out the window for fish			1
@entity1 's high - speed rail is so successful that one airline is considering getting into the business			1
more travelers now connect @entity17 and @entity18 by train than by air -- and high - speed rail between these two cities may get even faster and cheaper in the near future			1
@entity24 , a joint service of the @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 railways , is the speedy passenger train that zips you ( and up to 800 others in 18 sleek cars ) from downtown @entity18 to downtown @entity17 more easily than flying			1
direct @entity24 service from @entity17 to @entity35 also takes 2.5 hours			1
the actual tunnel crossing is a 20 - minute , black , silent , 100 - mile - per - hour nonevent			1
your ears wo n't even pop. in the 15 years that the bullet train has been running , not much has changed except @entity17 's @entity24 station -- it 's now @entity45 ( in @entity18 it stops at @entity47 ; in @entity35 it 's @entity49 )			1
but starting this winter , the pace of change is speeding up			0
in december , a high - speed connection between @entity35 and @entity53 opens , cutting the journey from @entity17 to @entity53 by an hour			1
in january , @entity24 's monopoly on using the @entity56 -- the tunnel beneath the @entity7 -- expires			1
with its @entity17 - @entity18 flights suffering , @entity58 realized if you ca n't beat ' em join ' em. in 2008 it announced a competing high - speed rail service between @entity17 and @entity18 to start in late 2010 -- but the economic downturn could put that service on hold			1
@entity58 will use the same tracks , but says its trains could run faster than @entity24 's ( a claim that @entity24 disputes )			1
the competition can only be good for travelers , but for now , you 'll have to use @entity24			2
their fares are reasonable but complicated			0
prices vary depending on how far ahead you reserve , whether you can live with refund restrictions , and whether you 're eligible for any discounts ( children , youths , seniors , round - trip travelers , and railpass holders all qualify )			2
fares can change without notice , but typically a one - way , full - fare ticket ( with no restrictions on refunds ) runs about $ 425 first - class and $ 300 second - class			1
cheaper seats come with more restrictions and can sell out quickly ( figure $ 80 to $ 160 for second - class , one - way )			1
unlike our cheapo airlines , you can take two large bags and one small day bag per person for no extra fee			0
since only the most expensive ( full - fare ) ticket is fully refundable , do n't reserve until you 're sure of your plans			1
but if you wait too long , the best deals will get bought up			0
when you 're ready to ride , you 'll find the process is similar to an airport check - in -- without all the drama , sole - baring shoe inspections , and waiting			2
you must be at the station at least 30 minutes in advance of your @entity24 trip			1
you 'll pass through airport - like security , show your passport to customs officials , and find your departure gate listed on a tv monitor			2
there are a few shops , newsstands , snack bars , and cafes ( i usually bring better , cheaper food for the trip from elsewhere ) , pay - internet terminals , and a currency - exchange booth with rates about the same as you 'll find on the other end			2
i like to ride in second class ( @entity131 class ) to save money			0
first class ( also called @entity134 ) gets you a little more leg and elbow room , a newspaper , a classy meal , and power plugs at your seat			0
as you zoom along at speeds up to 185 miles per hour , consider how long it took to link @entity28 and @entity29			0
since the days of @entity144 there had been talk about a tunnel under the @entity7 , but it was n't until 1986 that the two countries finally reached an agreement to build it together			2
once the digging started , crews crept forward 100 feet a day until june 1991 , when @entity29 and @entity153 workers broke through and shook hands midway across the @entity7			2
voila ! cheers ! the tunnel was complete			0
with 24 miles underwater , it 's the world 's longest undersea tunnel			0
the ambitious project helped to show the @entity1 community that cooperation between nations could benefit everyone			0
high - tech know - how , a shared @entity1 vision , and people 's love of travel have created incredibly fast trains that crisscross , link and strengthen @entity1			0
whizzing along on a @entity1 bullet train is the greenest way to go -- far more fuel - efficient and less polluting than flying			2
every time i ride through the @entity56 -- caught up on my research , well rested and unfrazzled -- i 'm thankful for @entity1 's comfortable rail network			0
@entity178 writes @entity1 travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio			0
