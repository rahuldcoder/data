-- what is going on inside the heads of those nine @entity4 justices ? this week 's legal drama around same - sex marriage makes me worry that they 're all thinking more about politics than doing right by the @entity10			1
do n't get me wrong			0
by deciding on monday to turn down all pending same - sex marriage cases , the @entity4 managed to bring marriage equality to at least five new states and many thousands of couples			1
in one sense , the @entity16 court has done more good simply by doing nothing than they 've been able to do in volumes and volumes of actual rulings			0
but i ca n't help but feel that the @entity4 's decision to turn down all those cases passed the buck on their core constitutional responsibility to do justice			1
over the past few years , we 've learned that the @entity4 does n't have a care in the world about taking up huge , hot button issues and issuing sweeping rulings that change the future of this country			1
crippled our campaign finance system			0
continued the war on women by putting their reproductive health decisions in the hands of corporations			0
( i do n't know about you , but i hear a lot from my @entity48 friends about " judicial activism			0
" those are the rulings that sound like judicial activism to meâ € ” striking down portions of critical laws that help make this a better , more equal country for all			0
) when it came down to guaranteeing the right to marriageâ € ” a fundamental constitutional rightâ € ” the court just passed the buck			1
the justices simply turned down the opportunity to do what 's right			1
and , yes , the court 's decision to turn down those cases on monday meant that some states won marriage equality by default			1
but what about everyone else ? what about a gay couple living in one of the states that is still being left behind , like my own home state of @entity79 ? there are folks in these states who have been living together for decades , going to church , volunteering , or working for a better future			1
if one of those folks gets in a car accident tomorrow , their partner , their spouse , has no legal right to survival benefits , to pensions , to being on the death certificate ! and the @entity4 wants to tell us that there 's no dispute here ? no federal issue that merits their immediate attention ? it 's absurd			2
campaign finance laws say a billionaire ca n't give a candidate a million dollars ? the @entity4 's on it like flies to honey			1
a little old lady 's partner of 40 years dies , but her state says they were never married in the eyes of the law ? " eh , " the @entity4 says , " we 'll get to it later			2
" it 's just wrong			0
people are suffering , the nation 's marriage laws are in chaos -- so what on @entity119 is the point of delay ? to me , the only reason seems to be politics			2
i worry that most of those justices did n't want to get their hands dirty by dealing with this deeply emotional and human issue			2
but folks , that 's just not how this social contract is supposed to work			0
if you 're a @entity4 justice , the @entity133 people have elevated you to one of the highest offices in the land out of the goodness of their heart and out of deference to your legal wisdom			1
you get a lifetime appointment , limitless prestige , a great office , and what i have to assume is a very comfortable chair			0
and as @entity133 , all we ask in return of our justices is that they do what 's right			0
the justices failed in that duty this week , and i hope they get a chance to remedy that decision sooner rather than later			2
after all , when deep , fundamental constitutional rights are at stake , we know from history that we can not tolerate two nations divided against one another			1
we need one nation , with liberty and justice for all			0
i hope we get one soon .			0

this week the @entity4 turned down all pending gay marriage cases
@entity169 : it seems like the justices are more concerned about politics
she says guaranteeing the right to marriage , a fundamental constitutional right , is critical
@entity169 : those who live in states that do n't *approve* of gay marriage deserve justice
