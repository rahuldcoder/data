-- the exhumation of three bodies from a @entity4 crypt may have brought @entity6 researchers a step closer to confirming the identity of the woman believed to be the subject of @entity12 's famous " @entity13 " painting , also known as " @entity13			1
" " @entity13 " refers to @entity14 , the second wife of a @entity4 silk merchant , @entity14			2
the remains of @entity17 , his son by @entity14 -- @entity21 -- and @entity14 's stepson @entity22 have been uncovered in their family crypt , the authority of @entity4 has announced			0
a team led by @entity26 accessed the remains beneath the @entity28 , in @entity4 on august 6 , it said in a statement			0
last year , @entity26 's team exhumed the remains of eight women from the ruins of a @entity35 convent in @entity4 where old city records said @entity14 had been buried			0
a laboratory at the @entity39 had established that three of the skeletons at the @entity43 convent were consistent with the age at which @entity14 had died , the statement said			0
further carbon testing to establish which of those skeletons dated from the 16th century -- when @entity14 died -- was being carried out at the @entity48 , it quoted @entity26 as saying			0
if @entity51 taken from the @entity14 family remains matched one of the skeletons found in the convent ruins , the skeleton could be confirmed as @entity14 's , he said			1
scientists could then reconstruct @entity14 's face and compare it to @entity12 's mysterious portrait			1
talking to @entity0 's @entity59 when the convent skeletons were found last year , @entity26 said the reconstruction would have a margin of error of just 2 to 8 % -- once researchers factored in that @entity14 had probably been in her early 20s when she posed for @entity12			1

for starters , the famous smile was not @entity14 's , he said			0
analysis of the " @entity13 " had shown that " when @entity12 began painting the model in front of him , he did not draw that metaphysical , ironic , poignant , elusive smile , but rather he painted a person who was dark and depressed			2

remains of *relatives* of the woman believed to be the " @entity13 " model have been found
researchers plan to check their **dna** against the **dna** of a skeleton found at her burial site
if there is a match , they will reconstruct the skeleton 's face and compare it to the portrait
