-- a small town in @entity2 is setting a precedent in eco-friendly road construction , breaking ground this week on one of the greenest streets in the nation			1
the tiny port town of @entity10 in @entity11 is billing the thoroughfare as the greenest on the @entity13			0
the road will help clean and filter toxic storm water pollution that drains into rivers , and eventually into @entity17			1
" what we 're hoping to do , from top to bottom , is build a street that is completely environmentally sustainable , " said @entity10 mayor @entity18			0
@entity18 says the blueprint incorporates native tree cover to cool off the streets , wind - powered street lights that use high - efficiency led bulbs , and pedestrian and bicycle access but most important , says @entity18 , is the plan for all that water that rolls down the streets when it rains			1
" [ it 's ] not going to be flushed into our local rivers			0
instead it 's going to be naturally filtered			0
and that 's very important for us to save our rivers and to help save the @entity17 here in @entity2			2
" storm water runoff often carries toxins and pollution from parking lots and city streets , and from farms and agricultural lands in rural areas			1
most cities and towns have underground concrete drain systems that collect the runoff and dump it into rivers and streams , pollutants and all			2
" what we 're going to do , instead , is divert that water into natural gardens			1
to the naked eye it just looks like a regular garden , but actually it 's very specially engineered to absorb a lot of water and naturally filter it before it gets into the water table , and to keep it from washing all those pollutants into the river , " according to @entity18			0
the storm water runoff in @entity10 drains into the nearby @entity70 , which feeds into the @entity71 , then empties into the @entity72 and eventually @entity17			1
the eco-street project includes using porous bricks in building the road and creating bioretention cells or rain gardens			2
the idea is to trap the polluted runoff water , sending it through natural filter systems so that when it makes it into the @entity70 , it 's a lot cleaner			1
@entity2 @entity83 deputy secretary @entity82 hopes this new main street in @entity10 is just the first of many			0
" this kind of green infrastructure project to reduce storm water and energy consumption is exactly the kind of thing we need to do around the bay watershed to reduce pollution			1
" @entity82 says the benefits of this project are twofold : a reduction in storm water pollution and , through the energy efficiency in powering lighting , a reduction in air pollution and fallout			1
but how much can converting one street really help in cleaning up an area the size of the @entity17 ? @entity82 acknowledges this is just the beginning			2
" we need to grow it by leaps and bounds			0
" the @entity10 green street project is funded by the @entity112 through a $ 1.1 million @entity114 grant			0
@entity82 says the state of @entity2 has already allocated $ 20 million for other green projects and that this is the first of many projects			0
the @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121 are also reviewing this green technology to eventually help do their part to clean up @entity17			2
and in the @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity71 , and @entity127 , @entity128 , have already taken steps to clean and control polluted storm water runoff			1
" our goal is that other towns and cities and communities will steal our ideas , " @entity10 mayor @entity18 said			0
" we 'll know we 're successful when we see these technologies used in other places			0

new road will help clean storm water pollution that drains into rivers , @entity17
road will divert runoff into natural gardens designed to filter water
plan also uses native tree cover to cool streets , wind - powered street lights
project aims to reduce storm water pollution , air pollution , fallout to the bay , official says
