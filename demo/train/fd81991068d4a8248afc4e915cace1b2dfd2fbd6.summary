-- if you have n't heard , " @entity2 " is coming back			1
on monday , @entity3 announced that the early - ' 90s @entity5 series would return for a limited run in 2016			1
' @entity2 ' returns -- on @entity3 a new " @entity2 " could be intriguing , since the show was so labyrinthine to start with			1
indeed , the @entity9 erupted with enthusiasm at the news			0
other ideas , such as the possibility of a " @entity15 " tv series , have n't been so well received			0
nowadays , there 's no reason that a show has to die completely			2
thanks to the endless appetite for content and nostalgia , old noble failures can be repurposed , rethought and recast to make shiny new failu -- uh , hopefuls			1
( besides , as the saying goes , there 's nothing new under the sun. ) what could these shows be ? a long time ago -- back in the ' 90s and ' 00s -- there was a program on the now - defunct network @entity36 called " brilliant but cancelled , " which was a way to showcase a number of notable network programs that died before their time			1
it was a chance to look anew at shows such as @entity44 's " @entity43 , " the prescient " profit " and the bizarre " @entity45 , " starring @entity46 and created by @entity47 and @entity48			2
( @entity36 , which had an interesting mix of old talk shows , @entity53 reruns and a smattering of new programming , also died before its time , with its plug pulled in 2005			2
) we 've come up with our own list of tv series that we would n't mind seeing get a second shot			0
with the right brain trust , some of these programs can be better than they were			0
the best example is probably " @entity67 , " which in its original incarnation was an old - fashioned space opera			0
when it was brought back in 2004 , it became a trenchant commentary on terrorism , religion and its impact on society			0
