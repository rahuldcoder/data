-- @entity1 is suddenly back at the top of the news			1
the drawdown of " combat " troops has been completed , the handover to the @entity8 looks shaky , violence is ticking up and there is still no new @entity1 government , more than five months after the march elections			1
all these are real , but they are only the most immediate manifestations of deeper and longer term issues that the @entity16 will need to manage			0
our diplomats face big challenges			1
let 's start with the @entity1 government			0
superficially , it looks as if former prime minister @entity25 and present prime minister @entity26 -- who came in first and second in the elections -- are in a huge personality clash			0
why ca n't one of them be a statesman and step aside ? the answer is that both they and other @entity1 politicians are worried about whether this will be their last opportunity to gain power			0
the @entity16 troops have de facto guaranteed for the past seven years that some sort of broad , representative democracy would continue in @entity1			1
but if the troops all leave by the end of 2011 , as currently agreed , who will guarantee the political system ? who will prevent a drift back to autocracy , or even a coup ? the transfer of lead responsibility from @entity16 troops to diplomats has done little so far to answer these questions			1
this is a big diplomatic challenge : to find ways to convince politicians in a country that has known little other than violent political change that their next political choice will be made at the ballot box			2
this is an even bigger challenge in @entity1 than elsewhere because of sensitivities about national sovereignty			2
@entity66 and @entity67 ( not to mention @entity68 and many others ) have welcomed both foreign troops and civilians deployed to their territory to maintain their newly minted democracies			0
@entity1 , while complaining that the foreign troops have made a mess and failed to clean it up , wanted the @entity16 out			1
the @entity8 needs to focus on finding ways to guarantee whatever solution the @entity1 work out			1
should it be " term limits " for @entity26 , as outgoing ambassador @entity80 has suggested ? a political pact that would allow @entity26 to remain for two years and then be replaced by @entity25 ? an agreed reduction in the prime minister 's powers , particularly his control over the armed forces ? someone outside the @entity1 political context is going to have to seal the deal with a commitment to make sure it is implemented			2
the most obvious vehicle for this is a new @entity94 resolution , but getting one is complicated by the fact that @entity1 wants an existing @entity94 resolution lifted			0
sounds like a classic diplomatic challenge			0
another option is the @entity100 , a bilateral commitment to continued @entity16 cooperation with @entity1 that the @entity1 sought and continue to think important			1
fully implemented , it would be little short of an alliance relationship with @entity1 , one that would encourage foreign investment and open up economic , educational and cultural opportunities for @entity1			2
@entity109 needs to convince the @entity1 that full implementation of the agreement depends on the continued existence of a broad - based democratic regime in @entity114			2
that also sounds like a classic diplomatic challenge			0
so , too , does another underlying issue : the @entity120 / @entity119 dispute along a lengthy confrontation line in northern @entity1 , where the @entity122 and its @entity124 military forces claim territory that lies beyond the territory @entity127 controlled during the @entity129 period			0
@entity16 military forces have been proactive in building confidence between the @entity124 and the @entity132 and ensuring that they do not come to blows			2
who will take on this role once the @entity16 forces withdraw ? the diplomats face many other challenges : they are going to be responsible for training the @entity1 police , they are going to have to protect themselves as they move about the country , they need to do much more to get @entity145 and other friends and allies engaged in @entity1 , they need to help @entity1 regain its regional role and settle its relations with the neighbors			1
some in @entity150 are asking , why do the @entity8 and @entity151 need $ 9 billion for @entity1 next year ? the better question is this : how much should we spend to protect an investment of over $ 700 billion that we have made over the past seven years ? the war is over , sort of , but the peace - building will go on for a long time			1
peace - building is expensive , but a lot cheaper than war			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			0

as @entity16 combat troops leave @entity1 , diplomats face challenge of building peace , says @entity162
he says @entity16 needs to guarantee the solution @entity1 develop to their political *impasse*
he says spending on diplomacy protects $ 700 billion investment @entity16 has made in new regime
