over the years , he 's taught us everything from where to buy quilts at a discount price to what teen spirit smells like			0
but now , " @entity1 " is no longer just doing funny spoofs of @entity15 and @entity16 ; he 's educating the internet on how to properly use the @entity19 comma			1
while he 's sold more than 12 million albums , earned three @entity21 and racked up four gold records , @entity1 may be at his artistic peak with the sublime new single , " @entity24			1
" @entity1 has turned @entity26 's not so humble brag about his dangling participle into something that could follow in the grand tradition of " @entity30 " and , he says , " ostensibly be part of a school curriculum			1

" there 's no lead single on this album because i do n't know what people are going to respond to the most			0
