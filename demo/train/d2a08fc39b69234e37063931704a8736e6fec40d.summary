-- while reading a story on this site about rare video games , @entity4 of @entity5 , @entity6 , recognized one of the games -- @entity9 for the @entity10			1
he found the thirteenth known copy of the game in his garage and put it on @entity15			1
it sold last sunday for $ 31,600 , the second - highest price ever paid for a video game			1
@entity4 bought the game when he was 11 or 12 years old at a store called tuesday morning in @entity21 , @entity6			2
the store bought overstocked or undersold goods from other retailers and sold the items at a discount			0
8 very rare and very expensive video games @entity4 said he paid between $ 5 and $ 10 for @entity9 in the mid- 1980s			1
this is important because none of the other twelve people who possess @entity9 cartridges were the original owners -- they bought them at auction , secondhand stores , or through private collectors			2
learning a collectible item 's " provenance , " or owner history , is key to proving its authenticity			0
since @entity4 was the original owner , his cartridge had more credibility than one found in a box at the local thrift store			2
6 more people who accidentally found a fortune oddly enough , @entity4 remembered that this much sought after game was n't really all that great			1
in fact , the only reason he still had it was because it was so bad			0
he and his friends used to borrow games from each other all the time -- sometimes you 'd get your game back , sometimes you would n't , and that was ok			2
but no one wanted to keep @entity9 , so it kept coming back to him			0
he 's not complaining now			0
while it 's impressive that @entity4 had the thirteenth known copy of @entity9 , he also had the original packaging , which changed everything			1
why ? because his was the only known @entity9 box in the world , making it the only known complete copy of the game in existence			2
but he could n't start counting his fortune just yet			0
if you 're willing to pay thousands of dollars for a video game , you 're going to make sure it 's legitimate			1
@entity4 knew this , so he went straight to an expert , @entity76 of @entity77 , a forum for fans of anything @entity10 , to get his professional opinion on the authenticity of the find			1
the two both live in @entity5 , so @entity76 met with @entity4 and examined both the game and the box in person			2
after some thorough research , @entity76 declared everything was real ( or the most impressive forgery he 'd ever seen )			0
with expert confirmation behind him , @entity4 pulled his stand - alone cartridge auction on @entity15 and replaced it with the complete game package			1
the starting price was $ .50			0
@entity4 's @entity15 auction ended on april 10 , 2010 at about 10:15 p.m. est. with only 5 minutes to go , the highest bid was $ 14,600			1
it sat at this price until the very last few seconds , when it jumped to $ 17,528 , and then made a giant leap to $ 31,500			0
the final bid was $ 31,600			0
this sets a new record price for the game , blowing away the previous record of $ 3,000			0
that also makes it the second - highest price ever paid for a video game cartridge , just behind the $ 43,300 paid for a factory - sealed copy of @entity112 for the @entity113 back in february			1
i asked @entity4 what he intended to do with the money and he was n't quite sure yet			0
he did know that he wanted to buy something tangible ; something he could point at it and say , " i bought that with a video game ! " now if you 'll excuse me , i have to go look for something in my garage			1
