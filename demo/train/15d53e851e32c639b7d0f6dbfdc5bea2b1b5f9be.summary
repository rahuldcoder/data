-- for listeners of police scanners , last week 's tragic events offered one real - time drama after another			1
during the fertilizer plant explosion in @entity9 that claimed 14 lives and the @entity12 bombings and subsequent manhunt , dispatchers ' static - filled audio feeds offered periodic clues about what was happening on the ground			2
listeners hungry for the most up - to - date police reports did n't need a scanner to keep up with the news -- many scanner feeds are available online , while some @entity24 users type out what they hear on scanners in real time			1
technology has given people more access to what 's being said on scanner feeds , often to the dismay of law enforcement agencies worried about the spread of misinformation and criminals eavesdropping on authorities ' tactical plans			1
early friday , as the night 's manhunt for the bombing suspects stretched into daylight , @entity43 , the primary online source for scanner feeds , did something it had never done before : it voluntarily took all the @entity49 law enforcement feeds offline			1
@entity43 licenses its streams to mobile apps such as 5 - 0 radio for @entity53 or @entity54 on @entity55 and is powered by an army of hobbyist volunteers -- local reporters , neighborhood watch members , off - duty public safety officers -- who just want to share what they 're hearing			1
they plug their scanner or radio into a computer and use special software to broadcast it online			1
@entity43 streams around 3,500 scanner channels , including local law enforcement , fire departments , weather service , emergency medical services and the @entity70			1
during peak traffic times last week , some 180,000 listeners were tuned in to @entity43 feeds at once -- by far the most traffic the service had ever seen , said founder @entity75			1
but when the @entity49 police posted a plea on @entity24 asking that people not compromise the safety of officers by broadcasting what homes were being searched , @entity43 obliged			1
online , the curious quickly found alternative ways to tune in			2
some people with their own scanners started live video streams of chatter from the radios in their homes			1
others with access to scanners began tweeting out snippets of what they heard			0
concerns about the safety of broadcasting police feeds have been amplified as technology has moved from clunky , home - bound radios to handheld radios , the @entity101 and now mobile apps available on any smartphone			1
while law - abiding citizens can now listen in anywhere , criminals can , too			0
" they ( criminals ) always carry radios or carry cellphones that have police scanners on them , " said sgt. @entity107 of the @entity108 , @entity109 , police			2
@entity43 's @entity115 stands by his decision to take down the @entity49 channels , but he maintains that scanner feeds do more public good than harm			1
" you 're going to be hard - pressed to evade law enforcement ( by ) reading stuff on @entity24 , " said @entity115 , who added he has never heard of a criminal successfully using the service to escape police			1
safety first even so , a number of safety precautions are already in place			0
more sensitive public safety information is often communicated over discreet channels , not the well - known dispatch channels			2
there is no law requiring public agencies to keep feeds publicly available , so many cities have opted to encrypt some or all of their transmissions			0
" the decision to go encrypted was for the safety of officers and security of the community , because when you can hear us on a scanner so can bad guys , " said @entity107 , the @entity108 police sergeant			1
his department made the move from open radio channels to an encrypted system in 2008			0
since then , most complaints about being cut off have come from local reporters who use scanners to get tipped off to crimes			0
upgrading to an encrypted system is n't a quick fix			0
the new equipment is expensive , and encryption comes with its own issues			0
it makes it difficult to communicate with other departments and agencies during an emergency			0
for example , the manhunt in @entity49 was a multiagency effort , involving federal and local command centers and various groups all trying to communicate with each other , which could n't have been done using just encrypted communication channels			1
for its part , @entity43 time - delays all feeds for 30 to 90 seconds			1
its terms of service prohibit providers from streaming sensitive feeds such as tactical , @entity182 , narcotics and fire investigation channels as well as most federal government channels			2
a bad game of telephone the bigger concern for some is the spread of misinformation , which can contribute to confusion , panic and , in the case of the @entity49 bombings , mistaken identity			2
people communicating over the radio are often just as confused about fluid situations as their listeners are			0
officials say anyone tuning into a live scanner feed , or reading a transcription of a feed on social media , should not assume that everything they 're hearing is accurate			0
@entity107 said the earliest information to come across scanners can often be wrong , and that the first eyewitness reports can vary wildly from what investigators eventually discover to be true			2
" you have to be very careful of what we hear , " he said			0
for example , a tweet surfaced thursday night that incorrectly named a missing @entity219 student as one of the suspects , citing police scanners as the source			2
the missing student 's family temporarily took down a @entity227 page asking for help finding him after being bombarded by negative comments			0
in this way , an incorrect tweet can take on a life of its own as it is quickly retweeted and quoted			0
any subsequent correction is seen only by people following that original person			0
even with these challenges , @entity115 has found that many agencies are happy to have people following the nonsensitive channels			0
a number of departments even share their official feeds with @entity43			1
" on the law enforcement side , they welcome public involvement ; more eyes and ears on the ground , " @entity115 said			0
" a lot of agencies see the benefit of making available what they do			0

police scanner streams and @entity24 accounts saw traffic surge during events in @entity49
experts warn that chatter on police feeds can be misleading and not always true
the old hobby of listening to police reports has moved online and to mobile apps
@entity43 , the primary source for scanner feeds , streams around 3,500 scanner channels
