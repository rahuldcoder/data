-- while @entity2 climbed into the crowd to hug his friends and family after clinching a record seventh @entity7 title on monday , @entity1 sat disconsolate at the side of the court			1
the world @entity11 's bid to become the first man since 1969 to hold all four grand slams had come to a disappointing end -- with a double - fault			1
one of the most anticipated finals in recent tennis history was largely sabotaged by wet weather , which meant the match was held over from sunday for only the second time			2
second - ranked @entity2 had been quickest out of the blocks after the resumption of play , breaking @entity1 's serve immediately , and even another downpour could not stop the @entity26 sealing a 6 - 4 6 - 3 2 - 6 7 - 5 victory as he won six of the nine games played			1
it took the 26 - year - old past @entity32 's mark of six successes at the clay - court major and extended his winning record at the tournament to 52 - 1			1
he has now joined the legendary @entity37 on 11 grand slam titles overall , along with @entity40 @entity39 -- who was the last man to hold all four major titles at one time			2
they trail another @entity40 , @entity44 , on 12 , @entity46 @entity45 on 14 and @entity47 -- beaten by @entity1 in friday 's semifinals -- on 16			1
" it 's an honor but the most important thing is this tournament			0
it 's unforgettable , one of the most special moments in my career , " @entity2 said			1
" it was a privilege to play against one of the best players in the world			0
" @entity1 , who lost in the semifinals last year , was left on five grand slams			2
he has won the @entity61 three times , including a record - breaking near six - hour final against @entity2 in january , plus last year 's @entity65 and @entity66 tournaments			1
" i feel really privileged to be in this position , being in the final at @entity7 for the first time , " the 25 - year - old said			0
" the playing conditions were not good			0
but it 's not anybody 's fault , and it 's not the reason why i lost today			0
" he is definitely the best player in history on this surface , and results are showing that he is one of the best players that ever played this game , and he is only 26 years old			2
hopefully we can have many more battles			0
" the tennis season now moves onto grass ahead of the next grand slam , @entity65 , which starts in @entity87 on june 25			0
the @entity89 tournament will also be held in the @entity91 capital .			0

@entity2 moves past @entity32 with record seventh @entity94 crown
