@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new tool that allows doctors to use laser surgery in complex operations has been hailed as a breakthrough in minimally invasive laser technology			1
this fiber optic tool is made from the perfect mirror , making it possible to reflect co2 lasers for the first time			1
originally designed as a military tool for the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , the fiber - optic invention is revolutionizing the ways surgeons carry out brain surgeries			1
the " omni directional dielectric mirror " was created by professor @entity19 , a then - 29 - year - old student in @entity20 at the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) in 1995			0
" i was asked to participate in a project funded by the @entity15 to create the perfect mirror , " @entity19 told @entity23			0
" the perfect mirror reflects light from all angles and does not absorb any of it			0
it could have been used , for example , to reflect back enemy laser beams , " he continued @entity32 , the @entity32 , a subsection of the @entity15 , specialize in technologies they believe are about 25 years away from being realized and try to make them happen in five years ' time			2
but they did n't have a long wait before they found their perfect mirror			0
" to my own surprise , i found the answer during the very first meeting			0
i thought everyone would laugh at my suggestion , so i waited until the last two minutes to talk and after i did , the room just fell silent , " @entity19 , a former commander in the @entity43 army , told @entity23			0
he found that by taking two materials with different optical properties ( one being a semi-conducting glass and one being a polymer ) and stacking these two up in very tight and ultra thin layers , around 1 micron each ( 1/1000 of a millimeter ) , they create an omni - reflector			0
the most important part of his discovery , however , was that by changing only the thickness and distance of the layers , the " perfect mirror " could reflect any type of electromagnetic energy in any wavelength			0
this meant @entity19 's invention was useful not only in the military and telecommunications field , but could also be used in minimally invasive laser surgery -- the use of lasers rather than scalpels to operate on everything from tumors , deafness and spine injuries			1
this type of surgery is known to reduce recovery time , the likelihood of complications and incision size			2
in many cases , patients also spend less time " under the knife			2
" @entity19 then set about creating a pen - shaped fiber - optic tool that could allow surgeons to easily manipulate the laser and bend it to reach almost any tissue in the body			1
the results , according to some surgeons who have used it , are astonishing			2
dr. @entity94 , a renowned @entity95 surgeon and former president of the @entity97 told @entity23 : " when @entity19 first called me to show me his fiber - optic tool made out of this perfect mirror , i was very skeptical as i had seen many unsuccessful trials			1
" " but as soon as we did the first tests , i was simply blown away , " he added			0
dr. @entity94 has now performed over 100 operations with the " perfect mirror laser " and says he finds it almost easier to use than a scalpel			1
dr. @entity107 , a senior neurosurgeon at @entity108 in the @entity109 , along with his partner , otolaryngologist dr @entity110 , also rave about the benefit of the fiber optic tool in minimally invasive surgery			1
in a recent case , dr. @entity107 's patient had a tumor at the base of the brain , a tumor that could have been more difficult and dangerous to remove without @entity19 's device			1
" using the scalpel could have caused a stroke , " dr. @entity110 told @entity23			2
" instead we used @entity126 laser to melt the tumor and then shave it off			1
" the whole operation took less than an hour and the patient recovered in only three days			2
according to dr. @entity94 , the perfect mirror is also an important development because , for years , doctors were able to treat patients with lasers in only limited circumstances and with many complications			0
until the " perfect mirror " came along there were no fibers that could transport the safer co2 lasers			0
surgeons had to shoot the laser beam directly from its large generator and could do so only at a straight angle , rendering it impossible to reach deeper tissues			2
" at the time , co2 lasers were like the perfect weapon for soldiers , but one that also happened to weigh five tons			0
they were very cumbersome , " says dr. @entity94			0
the surgeons believe laser technology will now become more widespread with the avenue of this tool that is " easy and intuitive to use			1
" next on @entity19 's to - do list is to take his fibers worldwide , especially in @entity158 , the @entity159 and @entity160			1
his company , @entity161 , aims to expand the tool globally : most clinics using it are currently in the @entity109			1
" i hope it can help patients around the world , " he said .			0

@entity167 is used to simplify and expand use of minimally invasive laser surgery
some surgeons say new tool is easier to use than a scalpel and safer for patients
senior neurosurgeon saw patient with brain tumor recover in three days
company plans to *market* fiber optic tool beyond the @entity109 to @entity158 and @entity160
