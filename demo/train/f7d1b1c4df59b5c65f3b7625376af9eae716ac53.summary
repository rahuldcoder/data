-- @entity3 is tightening security at all of its airports in the aftermath of a plot to send bombs from @entity3 to the @entity10 , the country 's @entity1 said monday			1
" every piece of cargo and luggage will go through extensive searching " at all of its airports , the agency said			2
cargo companies such as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 will be required to make more stringent checks before accepting any packages , according to the committee			2
other countries also put restrictions in place monday in reaction to the security concern			0
@entity29 banned all incoming flights from @entity3 , air traffic control officials said			1
and in the @entity32 , home secretary @entity31 told @entity33 that all passenger and cargo flights , as well as all flights holding unaccompanied freight from @entity3 and @entity38 , will be banned for a month , at which time the measure will be reviewed			1
@entity38 was included in the ban because of the possibility of contact between @entity43 in @entity3 and terrorist groups there			1
@entity32 banned passengers from carrying toner cartridges larger than 500 grams in hand baggage on flights departing the country			1
@entity51 is stepping up security ahead of a summit of world leaders next week , it announced monday			0
@entity56 will inspect all air cargo coming from destinations on the list of nations that sponsor terrorism , @entity51 customs said monday			0
the @entity63 has dispatched teams of explosive experts to the @entity32 and @entity66 to help examine the explosives found late last week , a federal law enforcement official said			1
the parcel companies also remained on alert			0
@entity18 , for instance , is not transporting or accepting any parcels originating from @entity3 , spokesman @entity70 said			1
the company continues to work with @entity10 authorities to assure that the highest safety levels are met , he said			2
it also is working to clear packages that have been held since friday			0
an embargo on shipments from @entity3 , which was set to expire monday , was extended through november 8 , a @entity10 @entity79 official said			1
a senior @entity3 government official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media , said the decisions to cancel flights and shipments out of @entity3 will be interpreted as a " collective punishment " against the country			1
the @entity3 public will see it as a collective punishment for unclear gains , the official said			1
nobody benefits from this except @entity43 , he added			0
meanwhile , @entity3 authorities are intensifying operations to capture militant cleric @entity100 and to capture or kill @entity43 bomb maker @entity101 , the senior official said			1
investigators in @entity3 strongly suspect that @entity101 , @entity43 's top bomb maker in the region , is behind the explosive devices sent in the parcels , he said			1
@entity10 authorities are also looking at @entity101 because the parcel bombs used the same explosive , @entity109 , as last year 's foiled underwear bomber , also linked to him			2
authorities , however , have not divulged details about the purported links between @entity101 and the explosives			2
@entity3 needs " a lot of help " to fight @entity43 , an aide to the country 's prime minister said monday			1
" @entity43 has got a global sort of agenda , so you need global collaboration and regional collaboration , " @entity120 said			0
" we need a lot of help as regards security information , logistics , " and new ways to confront them , he said , even as he emphasized that @entity3 does not want foreign troops on its soil			1
" we have got our security and our armed forces on the ground there , " he said , saying the country does not want to become another @entity135 , presumably referring to the 2003 @entity10 invasion			0
the @entity10 military commander credited with helping reduce violence in @entity135 said @entity143 had been concerned about @entity3 for some time			1
" when i was the commander in @entity135 , we already saw the problems starting to loom in @entity3 , " gen. @entity144 said			1
he said that when he was in charge of all @entity10 military forces in the region , " we did focus a great deal of additional attention on helping our @entity3 partners there , and the events of recent days have shown why that was valid			1
" on friday , authorities in the @entity66 and @entity32 found two packages with explosives that were destined for synagogues in @entity158 , @entity159			1
the explosive found in the @entity66 may have traveled on passenger planes to get there , airline officials said sunday			0
both explosives appear to have been designed to detonate on their own , without someone having to set them off , the top @entity165 counterterrorism official said			0
" it is my understanding that these devices did not need somebody to detonate them , " said @entity169 , president @entity170 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism			0
@entity10 investigators believe that bomb maker @entity101 , 28 , is linked to that package and another one found on an airplane in @entity32 's @entity185 on friday , a federal official , who was briefed by authorities , said sunday			1
@entity186 , who is thought to be in @entity3 , is a @entity187 who was high on @entity187 's list of most wanted published in february 2009			1
he is also believed to be the bomber who designed last year 's attempt to blow up an airliner on december 25			0
" the thinking is it 's the same person or group of people that built the underwear bomb because of the way it 's put together , " said a @entity10 government official , who had been briefed by multiple @entity10 authorities and law enforcement sources			1
" but this one is about four times as powerful			0
" separately , an engineering student arrested in @entity3 was released sunday , along with her mother , according to her father , @entity208			1
human rights attorney @entity209 earlier identified her as @entity210 , a fifth - year student at @entity211 in the @entity3 capital			2
a high - level source in the @entity66 said @entity210 's name was found on the cargo manifest of the device found in @entity217			0
she said monday that she was not guilty			0
" i am totally innocent , and there is no proof against me , and that 's why i have been released , " she said			0
authorities do not have any @entity10 suspects , a @entity10 official said			2
two schools in @entity3 were being looked at in connection with the plot and had been on the radar of @entity10 officials , the official said			2
the explosive device found in @entity217 , @entity66 , was contained in a @entity233 printer and had a motherboard originating from a mobile phone but did not have a sim card in it , the high - level source said			2
the device was professionally assembled , the source said			0
the motherboard was connected by a striker to the printer head and then to the cartridge , which was filled with explosives			2
authorities have the serial number of the motherboard and the printer , and they are searching to see where it was sold , how it was paid for and what information they can glean about the people who performed those transactions , according to the source			2
authorities believe an explosive device found at the @entity185 airport flew from @entity3 to a @entity257 state and then to @entity258 , @entity29 , the official said			1
the device was then transferred onto a @entity19 plane			0
investigators are still attempting to retrace the route of the @entity217 device , according to the high - level official			0
some believe that it went to @entity267 , @entity268 , on @entity269 , where it spent the night before traveling to @entity217 the following day			0
however , it does appear the devices flew on commercial passenger planes , the high - level official said			0
screening the devices would have been difficult , since printers normally contain computer parts and wires , according to @entity278 , @entity0 's aviation correspondent			0
@entity10 authorities are now endorsing @entity32 prime minister @entity282 's position that the explosives were designed to take down an airplane , the official said			1
however , a @entity10 official said sunday that the @entity10 has not drawn any conclusions on the intent of the bombs and whether they were intended to explode in flight , at the synagogues or somewhere else			0
@entity10 and @entity32 authorities think @entity43 's branch in @entity3 is linked to the plot			1
a key figure in the group is @entity100 , the @entity10 - born @entity3 militant cleric whom @entity10 authorities have linked to @entity297 shooting suspect maj. @entity298 and the man accused in the @entity301 bomb attempt			1
on friday , @entity169 declined to name @entity100 specifically as a suspect			0
" anybody who 's associated with @entity304 is a subject of concern , " he said			0
the @entity10 @entity79 is sending six inspectors to @entity3 to help improve cargo security , an official with the agency said sunday			2
" even before this incident , 100 percent of identified high - risk cargo on inbound passenger planes was being screened , " @entity79 administrator @entity311 said in a statement sunday , noting that security procedures will evolve based on the latest intelligence information			0
over the past several months , @entity3 , which wants to be seen as a committed partner in the fight against terrorism , has launched several offensives against @entity43 in its country but has not captured @entity100			2
@entity0 's @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 and @entity330 contributed to this report .			0
