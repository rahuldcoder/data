" he has been in an @entity6 prison for more than three years without any charge			1
on what basis does @entity6 arrest him ? he was not carrying any explosives , only his football outfit and his football shoes			0
@entity6 is violating international law , my brother does not belong to any militant organization , " @entity65 said			2
human rights lawyers contest @entity6 's detention of @entity2 and say it is politically motivated			1
" the use of the ' illegal combatant law , ' like in the case of @entity2 , is a political reason and not a security reason as @entity6 is claiming , " said @entity70 , the director of @entity71 , a group that advocates human rights and provides prisoner support			2
@entity80 went further , accusing @entity6 of detaining him to damage his career			0

they also said pulse disruptions are endangering his life			0
@entity105 , the director of prisoners and detainees for @entity90 , told @entity1 that " @entity2 is the longest @entity3 on hunger strike , and we are afraid that the medical center of the @entity6 prison service is not the right place for him to be , because they are not able to give him the proper treatment , especially if something happens in his condition while on hunger strike			1
the fear is that there will be rapid deterioration ; they can not perform medical tests such as blood tests and ultrasound or an x-ray on the spot			0
" @entity15 , the statement said , has lost muscle tissue and a drastic amount of weight , and needs immediate hospitalization			0

the statement called for the strikers to be moved to civilian hospitals with access to independent doctors and family members , and urged the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 to pressure @entity6 to end administrative detention			2
an @entity152 report released wednesday calls on the @entity6 government to release all prisoners held under administrative detention or to give them fair trials			2
titled " @entity165 , " the report says that the nonviolent protests , which brought several detainees close to death , drew global attention to the fact that @entity3 prisoners held by @entity6 continue to be starved of justice			0
