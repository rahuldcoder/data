ladies : i know you 've heard the news that some doctors think you should just say no to your annual pelvic exam			1
" doctors are examining your genitals for no reason " and " @entity13 " were just a few of the headlines that followed last week 's report from the @entity9			1
but before you hop out of those stirrups , listen to what happened to this woman			0
she went in for her yearly checkup , and the gynecologist did a regular pelvic exam -- one hand in her vagina , one hand on top of her belly -- and it was unusually painful			1
the doctor felt some inflammation and sent the patient for an ultrasound			0
more testing found pre-cancerous polyps in her colon , which she promptly had removed			0
the patient was in her late 40s and would n't have started regular colonoscopies until she was 50 , so her pelvic exam caught the pre-cancerous condition early			1
" i feel like my astute gynecologist saved my life , " the patient told me			0
and this patient knows a few things about medicine : she 's dr. @entity42 , the former director of the @entity43			0
so if pelvic exams can find bad things , why did the @entity9 recommend doctors skip them ? this group of internal medicine doctors -- they 're not gynecologists -- said that while there may be some success stories , those are merely anecdotes			1
the group said there are no actual studies showing pelvic exams help women , and it believes the exams could actually hurt them			1
as someone with a master 's degree in public health , this made sense to me			0
but since my own annual exam is coming up , i decided to take a closer look			0
my conclusion : the @entity9 has made some judgments based on some very thin research			1
so i am going to continue getting my exams			2
here 's why : during a pelvic exam the doctor inserts a speculum to open the vagina and look inside for things that should n't be there , such as growths on the cervix			1
if you 're due for a @entity83 smear , the doctor will do one at this point in the exam			0
since the doctor ca n't see the uterus , fallopian tubes and ovaries , he or she then removes the speculum and inserts two gloved fingers into the vagina and places the other hand on the lower abdomen to feel for abnormalities , such as inflammation , tumors or cysts			2
doctors have been doing this exam on women with no gynecological symptoms for as long as anyone can remember			0
there are plenty of studies showing the @entity83 smear saves lives , but does a visual and manual inspection do any good ? the @entity9 looked and did n't find a single study that assessed whether routine pelvic exams save lives or make women healthier			1
" i do n't want to do an exam that does n't have any documented benefit , " said dr. @entity115 , who , with funding from the @entity117 , reviewed the medical literature for the @entity9			1
i get it , but just because no one 's ever sat down and studied these exams does n't mean they 're useless -- it just means no one 's studied them			1
so i called up a handful of gynecologists to ask if they 'd ever made any great saves like @entity42 's gynecologist			0
while the catches might not be as dramatic , they 've all caught bad stuff women would n't have known about otherwise : warts on a woman 's cervix ; @entity141 lesions that could have spread to a sexual partner ; benign ovarian cysts that were n't painful but could twist and rupture ; and , on occasion , they found ovarian cancer			1
that left me thinking i do want this exam , unless it causes me too much harm			0
the @entity9 says " physical harms may include urinary tract infections			1
" yikes , i do n't want a urinary tract infection			1
but what 's the evidence that this actually happens ? strangely , the organization 's guidelines did n't give any , so i called dr. @entity157 , the lead author			2
he told me he got his information from the evidence report written by @entity160 , but when i looked at that report , there was nothing			2
so i gave @entity160 a call			0
" the data about urinary tract infections is bad data , so i did n't include it in the final version of my report , " she said			1
" i do n't know why they put that in the guidelines			2
" the past president of the @entity9 , dr. @entity174 , says , both as a doctor and a patient , urinary tract infection does n't " figure into my benefit / harms calculus			1
" okay , i thought to myself : if the former president of the @entity9 is n't worried , i wo n't be either			1
so what should i worry about ? unnecessary surgery , according to the college			0
sometimes your doctor will do a pelvic exam and see or feel something that they think is worrisome but is actually a big nothing , and you have surgery you did n't need			1
but again , where 's the evidence ? the @entity9 cites one study			1
that study , done in @entity197 , looked at 174 healthy women whose doctors found something worrisome on their pelvic exams			1
these women had more testing , and doctors decided to do laparoscopic surgery on 31 of them			0
ovarian cancer was found in two of these women , so the @entity9 concluded that the other 29 had " unnecessary " surgery			1
there are two problems with this conclusion			2
one , while these women did n't have ovarian cancer , during the surgery doctors did find other things , such as benign ovarian cysts , that were removed			2
@entity160 , the associate chief of staff for research at the @entity222 in @entity223 , agreed that some of these surgeries she deemed " unnecessary " might actually have been helpful			0
it 's impossible to know because the @entity197 paper contains very few details			0
the second problem with labeling these surgeries " unnecessary " is that the @entity197 women got their care from 1991 to 1993			0
doctors are now much more adept at weeding out people who do n't need surgery because of better imaging technology			2
5 questions to ask before surgery " to extrapolate anything from a study done in @entity197 in 1992 to the @entity244 in 2014 is unconscionable , " says dr. @entity239 , vice president of health policy at the @entity241			0
the professional organization is not going to change its recommendations in light of this report , saying they believe pelvic exams can still be valuable			1
so we have different doctors with different opinions			0
you and i get to be empowered patients and decide who we agree with			0
for me , i do n't want to miss something that could be serious			2
i 'll take the small chance that an exam will lead me to an unnecessary surgery because before i would have that surgery i would ask good questions and get a second or third opinion if necessary to make sure i really needed it			0
so ladies : if you choose to have a routine pelvic exam , do it with your vagina and your eyes wide open			2
know that science is n't perfect			2
but also know that you , and not a group of doctors looking at that imperfect science , will make that decision .			0

the @entity9 recommend against pelvic exams
the data backing the report was *sketchy* at best
asked about exams causing urinary tract infections , the data did n't hold up
pelvic exams have caught problems regularly
