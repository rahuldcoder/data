@entity0 -- president @entity2 threw his full support behind a comprehensive overhaul of @entity6 immigration laws on tuesday , saying " now 's the time " to replace a system he called " out of date and badly broken			1
" the president specified three pillars of immigration reform : better enforcement of immigration laws , providing a path to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country , and reforming the legal immigration system			1
speaking at a majority @entity21 high school in @entity0 , @entity2 said " a broad consensus is emerging " behind the issue across the country , with signs of progress in @entity27			2
@entity29 ' welcomes ' new @entity6 immigration reform push however , he acknowledged a fierce debate ahead on an issue he described as emotional and challenging , but vital to economic growth and ensuring equal opportunity for all			2
" at this moment , it looks like there 's a genuine desire to get this done soon			0
and that 's very encouraging , " @entity2 said , later adding : " this time , action must follow			1
we ca n't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate			2
" the president spoke a day after eight senators -- four from each party -- introduced a framework for overhauling the immigration system that would provide an eventual path to citizenship for most of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in @entity6			1
while touted as a breakthrough by its drafters , the plan was similar in many aspects to previous immigration reform efforts that have failed in recent years			1
@entity2 described the blueprint as a sign of renewed desire by @entity62 and @entity63 to tackle the issue , saying the plan was " very much in line with the principles i 've proposed and campaigned on for the last few years			1
" @entity69 : @entity70 or path to citizenship ? he was criticized by @entity21 activists for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise to make overhauling immigration policy a priority of his first term			0
as his re-election campaign heated up last year , the @entity2 administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the @entity21 community			1
exit polls in november indicated that @entity21 voters overwhelmingly supported @entity2 over @entity63 challenger @entity89 , who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves			2
@entity2 won @entity92 , a battleground state with a large @entity21 population			2
@entity2 appeared on tuesday at @entity94 , which has a 54 % @entity21 student body , according to @entity96 rankings			2
to earn the opportunity for citizenship , @entity2 said undocumented immigrants must first pass a background check , learn @entity102 , pay a penalty , and then get " in the back of the line " behind people trying to come to @entity6 legally			2
immigration plan : a new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity ? millions of undocumented immigrants would get immediate but provisional status to live and work in the @entity6 , under the compromise plan crafted by the senate group			1
that outline also called for strengthening border controls , improved monitoring of visitors and cracking down on hiring undocumented workers			0
only after those steps occurred could undocumented immigrants already in the country begin the process of getting permanent residence -- green cards -- as a step toward citizenship , the senators said at a news conference on monday			1
before @entity2 spoke on tuesday , @entity130 sen. @entity130 of @entity131 said any legislation based on the framework he helped draft must include tougher law enforcement sought by conservatives to get his vote			1
@entity138 ' days filled with fear , uncertainty , separation " we need border security , we need workplace enforcement , we need a visa tracking system , " @entity130 said , adding later that would oppose a bill that lacked language guaranteeing that " nothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place			2
" @entity130 and other senators involved in the bipartisan immigration effort said monday they plan to provide a bill to the @entity154 in march , with hopes of getting the measure passed over the summer a few hours later , @entity2 said he would propose his own immigration bill if @entity27 failed to act on the issue in a timely manner			1
on the @entity163 side , a similar effort on immigration is said to be under way involving a group of @entity63 and @entity62			1
two senior @entity163 @entity62 sources briefed on that effort told @entity1 the group was working to release some sort of outline of its plan soon , possibly as early as this week , but concede " they are not as far along as the @entity154			1
" by the numbers : immigration and naturalization @entity154 lays out blueprint the principles described by @entity2 on tuesday were similar to the framework proposed monday by the eight senators			1
conservatives split on reform other conservatives immediately voiced their opposition to what they called amnesty , a code word on the political right for providing undocumented immigrants a path to legal status			0
" our immigration laws are n't broken , they just are n't enforced , " argued rep. @entity191 , @entity192 , after @entity2 's speech			1
" ... we 've been down this road before with politicians promising to enforce the law in return for amnesty			0
and then after the amnesty , they fail to make good on the enforcement promises			0
the @entity6 people should not be fooled			0
when you legalize those who are in the country illegally , it costs taxpayers millions of dollars , costs @entity6 workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration			0
" @entity63 sen. @entity212 of @entity213 objected to the framework by his @entity154 colleagues , saying the guidelines " contemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to undocumented immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country			0
" what 's in @entity154 immigration plan ? @entity130 rejected such a characterization on tuesday , saying that the framework would require undocumented immigrants to undergo a background check and face immediate deportation if they committed any serious crimes			1
otherwise , they then would have to pay any taxes owed as well as a fine to get what @entity130 called " the equivalent of a non-resident visa that allows you to work here			2
" an opportunity to get a green card and possible citizenship would only come after the government undertakes other steps , such as increasing border security , he added			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , signaled disagreement with @entity63 over the state of border security , saying in his speech that the @entity247 border was more secure than ever			0
he mentioned steps to crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers , as well as unclogging the legal immigration system to encourage highly skilled and educated workers already in the country to remain instead of taking their expertise abroad			0
@entity62 senators backing the framework unveiled monday plan include @entity258 of @entity259 , @entity260 of @entity261 , @entity262 of @entity263 and @entity264 of @entity265			0
on the @entity63 side were @entity130 , @entity267 of @entity268 , @entity269 of @entity270 and @entity271 of @entity268			0
@entity260 said tuesday that immigration reform must have bipartisan support to work , so it wo n't include everything everyone wants			1
path to citizenship : senators outline bipartisan immigration plan " it 's going to look different than what i might write , or the president might write , " he said			1
like the @entity154 framework , the @entity163 plan will include a path to citizenship , but details of how that will work are still being discussed			1
the @entity154 proposal is a good starting point , rep. @entity293 , @entity131 , said tuesday on @entity1			0
" i think it puts us in a very good place , " he said			0
a litany of left - leaning advocacy groups spoke out on the senators ' plan , praising it as a good first step but cautioning against harming the rights of workers			0
" the people of this country are ready for us to be one country again without second - class people being mistreated simply because they lack paper , even though they are already contributing to our economy and our tax system , " @entity306 president @entity305 said			0
opinion : worker visas are the key to immigration reform @entity320 president @entity319 told @entity321 on tuesday that his labor federation representing 12 million people will mount a " full - fledged " campaign in support of comprehensive immigration reform			2
" we think everybody ought to have the right to work hard and to progress to citizenship , " @entity319 said			0
meanwhile , @entity6 @entity332 president @entity331 has been in talks with @entity319 on the issue			0
he said after @entity2 's remarks that @entity6 business hoped for changes this year			1
" we should seize this opportunity to create an immigration system that serves the interests of our economy , our businesses , and our society , " @entity331 said			0
in a sign of the heated public debate on the issue , a group of about two dozen protesters standing across the street from the @entity0 high school waved signs opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants as @entity2 's motorcade drove past			1
lawmakers : @entity63 needs to back immigration overhaul @entity1 's @entity357 in @entity0 and @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 and @entity364 contributed to this report , which was written by @entity366 in @entity367 .			0
