-- @entity3 's " @entity2 " co-stars may accept his decision not to support their film because of its intense violence , but that 's not to say they agree with him			1
returning stars @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , who were all in 2010 's " @entity2 , " told @entity0 that they view the story of everyday citizens who create superhero alter egos to fight crime as a form of escapism rather than an encouragement to behave the same way			1
" here 's the thing : you know , it 's a movie , " said @entity10 , 16			2
" i think if you are the type of person who 's going to be affected by a movie , you should n't go see anything			1
you should n't go see a princess movie because then you 're going to think you 're a princess ! ... i make movies for fun			2
and i think movies are for people to escape and to see stuff that is completely unrealistic			0
" like its predecessor , the sequel 's adapted from the graphic novels by @entity37 , who 's said that while his work lives up to its title , it 's meant to be pure entertainment			1
for @entity3 , though , the debate is a matter of conscience			1
" i did kickass a month b4 @entity47 and now in all good conscience i can not support that level of violence , " he tweeted in june			1
" ( m ) y apologies to others involve with the film			2
i am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart			0
" " i think with all the tragedies that happened ( in the past ) year with the movie theater shooting , and @entity47 , and all that stuff ... he had to step back and he 's like , ' i ca n't promote this movie , it 's not in my heart			1
' and i respect that opinion , " @entity11 told @entity0 of @entity3 's announcement			1
" i see movies as a kind of escape to get away from the real world for a couple hours			0
but i do n't know what kind of people are out there			0
like chemically imbalanced in their minds , you know , what they think , what inspires them			0
" portraying a teen character named @entity82 , @entity10 said she always thinks about how her job can impact society , but the answer to her is a separation of fact from fiction			0
" i 'm not playing myself , you know ? and as @entity90 , i would never in a million years do it , and i know that difference , " @entity10 said			0
" even when i was 11 , i knew that difference			0
" the reality , said @entity9 , who plays the titular @entity2 , is that moviegoers buying tickets for an r - rated film are going to have certain expectations -- even from @entity3 's new character , @entity100			1
" @entity3 brings such a fantastic element to this movie			1
the same kind of mad kookiness that ( @entity106 ) @entity105 did in the first ( ' @entity2 ' ) , " @entity9 said			2
" that 's kind of what ' @entity2 ' is , it 's so off the wall			1
but the violence is all comic book violence , and it 's a fictional piece			2
i think that 's what people are expecting to see -- it 's an r - rated movie			1
" for the fans who are anticipating the same tone as the first film , @entity9 promises they 've kept that level of darkness in tact			0
" at the end of the day , it 's entertainment , " he said			2
" this is even darker			0
... i think there 's so much packed in that they 're not going to come out going , ' aw , i wish i saw her do this or do that			0
' they 're going to be like , ' @entity133 , ' what ? ! ' just processing it all is going to take a couple days			0
" @entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
