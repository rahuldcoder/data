-- steps were being taken to guard against a new threat of " body bombs " planted inside passengers aboard flights heading to the @entity9 from overseas , a government official with knowledge of the threat said tuesday			1
authorities have increased aviation security , especially on air carriers heading to the @entity9 from the @entity20 , other parts of @entity11 and the @entity12 in the days surrounding the one - year anniversary of the death of @entity16 leader @entity15 , said the official , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the information and to protect the specifics of how the risk came to light			1
@entity27 reported on monday officials fear @entity16 may soon attempt to explode @entity9 - bound aircraft with the body bombs			1
the body bomb threat has surfaced before , but the renewed concern is based on new information originating overseas , the official said			1
details of the threat have been shared among intelligence agencies in the @entity9 and the @entity20 within the past two weeks , the official said			1
an @entity37 official declined comment on the information , but said , " the @entity37 takes all threat stream information seriously and runs it down to the best of our ability with all available resources			2
" @entity45 spokesman @entity44 said monday authorities have " no indication of any specific , credible threats or plots against the @entity9 tied to the @entity15 anniversary			1
" @entity51 killed @entity15 during a raid on a @entity54 compound on may 2 , 2011			0
" @entity45 will continue to monitor intelligence reporting and respond appropriately to protect the @entity9 people from an ever - evolving threat picture , and as always , encourage the public and our partners in law enforcement and the private sector to remain vigilant in promptly reporting any suspicious activities , " he added , declining comment on the @entity27 report			1
speaking before the @entity27 story was published , a separate law enforcement official claimed not to know of any security increases but said each locality makes its own decision			2
the official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , similarly said that there is " no intelligence to indicate a credible threat " of attack to coincide with the anniversary of @entity15 's death			2
body bombs gained worldwide attention in 2009 when @entity16 's chief bomb - maker , @entity83 , built a device containing around 100 grams of @entity85 , a difficult - to - detect powdery explosive , that was designed to be inserted inside the rectum of a suicide bomber			1
the suicide bomber was his younger brother , @entity89			0
their target was prince @entity92 , the head of @entity94 counterterrorism , whose security services had driven them out of @entity94 two years earlier			0
their group , @entity97 , was determined to show that even well - protected targets outside @entity100 were not beyond their reach			0
in the end , the attack failed			0
despite gaining entry to @entity92 's residence by claiming to be defecting , @entity89 killed only himself ; the head of @entity94 counterterrorism was just slightly injured			0
but even in failure , his brother and comrades were emboldened			0
never had @entity16 come so close to killing a member of the @entity94 royal family			2
