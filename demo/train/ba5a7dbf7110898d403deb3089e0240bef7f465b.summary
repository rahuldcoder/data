liberals feared that a @entity2 presidency could mean the end of the most significant piece of social legislation in half a century			0
conservatives feared a second @entity8 term would allow implementation of another massive entitlement program			1
but for hospital administrators and businesses like health insurance companies and drug makers , the biggest fear on election night was that they would be left with an enormous mess to clean up			0
although the @entity18 , passed in 2010 , wo n't be fully in place until 2014 , billions of dollars have already been distributed and the wheels of reform have begun to turn			1
seniors with @entity24 prescription drug coverage are getting cash rebates			0
young adults have joined their parents ' insurance policies			0
@entity29 with pre-existing conditions are getting health coverage through @entity18 programs			2
some states are setting up health insurance consumer assistance bureaus and drawing up the architecture for new exchanges where private health insurance will be sold and regulated			0
stopping all of that , which @entity2 vowed to do if not by edict then by throwing truckloads of sand in the government 's regulatory gears , would have created chaos			2
@entity46 : @entity18 's ' health panel ' the ability of critics to challenge the law 's legitimacy was drastically reduced with the @entity52 upholding its constitutionality earlier this year			1
but it is also important that @entity8 administration officials will be in charge during the law 's full implementation			1
hospitals , insurers , drug companies and patients can now expect a more orderly rollout of the @entity18 over the next few years			2
as @entity65 reported in @entity66 last week , the @entity8 administration recently reduced the flow of new regulations defining precisely how the legislative language of @entity18 would work in practice			1
the purpose of holding back new rules was to avoid controversy close to the election			0
as @entity65 reported , there 's now a backlog of new regulations that are expected to be unveiled soon , including some that could affect wide swaths of the population			1
we still do n't know , for example , what health services and expenses insurers will be required to cover under @entity18			1
at the same time , governors will soon decide whether to set up their own health insurance marketplaces to regulate individual and small business health plans			0
many @entity90 governors had held off making this call until after the election			0
states that opt not to set up exchanges will open the door for the federal government to run them instead			0
thanks to a part of the @entity101 ruling that left the law 's large @entity103 expansion as optional instead of mandatory for states , governors and state legislatures will also have to decide whether to widen eligibility for the public insurance program			1
( here 's a reliable timeline of @entity18 provisions and when they are scheduled to go into effect			1
) as @entity116 reported for @entity117 , some state - based republicans may be persuaded to get on board with such pieces of the law now that it 's definitely staying on the books : " @entity122 , a @entity90 and one of the longest serving @entity125 lawmakers , said with the president 's win , the @entity90 - dominated state legislature would ' take a hard look ' at expanding @entity103 â€” despite the opposition of @entity131 gov. @entity131			2
" @entity122 , who is moving from the @entity132 to the @entity133 next year , said @entity125 ca n't afford to miss out on new revenue without having its own plan to help more than 4 million residents who lack health insurance			2
he acknowledged that challenging @entity131 would be an uphill battle but said the governor 's waning popularity might embolden lawmakers			2
" @entity46 : what the health care decision means for the country despite the @entity18 's more certain future under an @entity8 second term , controversy over the law is n't over			1
the public is still largely split on its merits			0
@entity90 state lawmakers and governors wo n't suddenly and universally back the law			1
republicans in @entity156 still have say over funding for some of its programs			0
but the health care industry is now free from a great deal of uncertainty			0
or at least it 's free from this round of uncertainty			0
any policy , business sector or law that 's tangled up with politics will always retain a tinge of the unknown			2
this article was originally published on @entity46 what @entity8 's re-election means for health care			1

@entity8 administration officials will be in charge during the law 's full implementation
there 's a backlog of new regulations that are expected to be unveiled soon
