one of the nation 's foremost experts on keeping clients off death row is joining boston marathon bombing suspect @entity5 's defense team			1
@entity7 , a @entity8 lawyer , has successfully fought for the lives of @entity10 , aka the @entity10 ; @entity11 , the gunman who killed a judge and wounded @entity15 rep. @entity14 ; and other high - profile defendants			1
in many of @entity20 's cases , a life sentence is a victory			1
she has made a specialty of defending people accused of the worst crimes imaginable			2
there 's nothing flashy about @entity20 , nothing to announce " here 's the high - profile criminal attorney " as she arrives in court to defend clients the rest of society loathes			1
she is , perhaps , the best defense lawyer you 've never heard of			0
a longtime colleague calls her lack of ego " almost freakish			0
" public defenders are the embodiment of a criminal justice system that believes everyone is innocent until proved guilty , that even people accused of horrific crimes deserve someone to stand up for them and find their humanity			0
many of @entity20 's colleagues believe she is the perfect lawyer for the job			1
@entity49 , a law school classmate and occasional legal colleague , spoke with @entity51 in january 2011 , when she was appointed to defend @entity11			1
" @entity7 is as genuine as a person can be , " @entity49 said			1
" she explodes every myth about lawyers			0
she is motivated by a passion to stick up for the little guy , and there is nobody littler than a defendant accused of a horrendous crime who everybody wants to string up			0
" federal prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty against @entity5			1
but few legal observers will be surprised if they do			0
nor would they be surprised if the defense raises issues about @entity5 's mental state			1
" i 'm glad she 's on the case			2
she 's a great lawyer , " said @entity72 , a former federal public defender from @entity73 , @entity74			2
@entity76 recruited @entity20 to help him with the @entity10 case			1
" she 's a walking encyclopedia , she knows the law , and she has great empathy for the client , " he said			2
" she does it all			0
" @entity84 , a professor at @entity85 and a former federal prosecutor , said of @entity20 , " she is familiar with the federal death penalty , insanity defenses , high - profile cases , and difficult clients			1
" @entity20 has no taste for designer clothes , sound bites or talking heads			1
in fact , she has absolutely no use for the media			0
as a public defender , she did n't need publicity to hustle up paying clients			0
she was on a government salary , and there was no shortage of poor defendants			0
for much of her 30 - year career , @entity20 ran the federal public defender offices in @entity8 and in @entity109 , @entity110			1
in the mid- 1990s , she became the first federal public defender to head the @entity112			0
now , even though she is in private practice , other public defenders seek her help on the tough cases			2
and so @entity20 prefers to do her talking to judges , juries , other lawyers and law students			1
not surprisingly , @entity20 did not return @entity51 's calls for comment			1
but she spoke freely last year with the magazine at @entity110 and @entity125 , where she and her husband teach , as does @entity49			0
she is a visiting professor , teaching third - year law students , and she articulated the philosophy that defines her as a defense lawyer : " we stand between the power of the state and the individual , and in doing so defend the core values that make this country great , " @entity20 said			1
" none of us , including those accused of a crime , wants to be defined by the worst moment , or the worst day of our lives			0
" colleagues say @entity20 is highly effective			1
an ardent opponent of the death penalty , she has kept some of the nation 's most despised criminals -- baby killers , bombers , white supremacists and terrorists -- off death row			1
you might know some of her clients by the public nicknames they acquired : the @entity10 , the @entity159 bomber and the 20th hijacker			1
@entity20 is so relentless , her work ethic so formidable , that she often seems driven			1
but her ambition is not for herself , colleagues say			0
she believes in the system			0
she was raised in @entity166 , @entity167 , and graduated in 1974 from @entity168 in @entity169 , @entity170			0
she received her law degree in 1977 from the @entity172 , where @entity49 was a couple of years ahead of her and served as a student adviser			0
her talent was immediately apparent , he said			0
later , as a defense attorney in @entity170 , @entity49 recruited @entity20 to help him defend @entity178 , the emotionally disturbed mother who in october 1994 strapped her two boys into her car and let it roll into a lake , drowning them			1
the defense argued that it was a failed suicide attempt			0
it was @entity20 's first capital case			1
" this is not a case about evil , " she told the jury as the trial began in state court during the summer of 1995			0
" this is a case about despair and sadness			0
" @entity20 did n't argue insanity but brought her client 's abusive childhood and adult depression alive for the jury			1
she portrayed @entity178 as a woman so tormented by her failures in life that she even failed at her own suicide and jumped out of the car			1
" she snapped , and @entity208 and @entity209 are gone , " @entity20 told jurors			1
" @entity178 broke where many of us might bend			1
" she let jurors feel @entity178 's confusion and pain , and they took 2½ hours to convict @entity178 of murdering her sons			1
but they spared her life			0
afterward , the judge was so impressed with @entity220 work , he increased her pay to $ 83,000			0
she paid the taxes and donated the money to a nonprofit agency that defends the poor in capital cases			1
state officials were not so impressed			0
they passed a law that prohibited out - of - state lawyers from working on @entity231 death penalty cases			2
that law is still on the books , @entity49 said			0
we 've been hit before on home soil @entity20 went on to join the defense teams in other high - profile capital cases in the federal courts			1
all were settled through plea bargains that took the death penalty off the table			2
among them : @entity10 : the mathematician known as the @entity10 pleaded guilty in january 1998 to making and transporting bomb materials that killed three people			1
federal prosecutors in @entity73 , @entity74 , backed away from the death penalty after their own expert diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic			2
@entity249 : the @entity251 member pleaded guilty in 2001 and was sentenced to five life terms for a racially motivated shooting spree at a @entity255 @entity254 and the fatal shooting of a @entity258 - @entity15 postal worker in 1999			0
prosecutors dropped the death penalty when the defense documented and charted @entity263 's long history of psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder			2
the decision later was criticized by the victims ' families			0
child shooting victims : what they 've learned from the past @entity271 : the man known as the @entity159 bomber pleaded guilty in 2005 to bombing a women 's clinic in @entity275 , @entity276 , and other bombings , including at the @entity278 in @entity279			2
he was a survivalist and spent years on the @entity282 's most wanted list			2
prosecutors dropped the death penalty after @entity271 led them to several dynamite caches in the @entity167 woods			2
@entity287 : the 9/11 conspirator is sometimes referred to as the 20th hijacker			0
@entity20 worked only briefly on this case			2
he repeatedly fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself , abruptly pleading guilty to terror conspiracy charges in july 2002			0
his life was spared in 2006 when a lone juror held out against a death sentence after a trial punctuated by the defendant 's outbursts			2
@entity11 : the suspended community college student pleaded guilty to 19 murder and attempted murder counts in the @entity303 shooting rampage that killed a federal judge and a 9 - year - old girl and seriously wounded @entity15 rep. @entity14			2
two mental health experts diagnosed him as paranoid schizophrenic , and he was sentenced to life in prison under a plea bargain .			0
