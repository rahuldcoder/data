-- taken at face value , a @entity2 presidency should be a big deal for @entity5			1
on election day i attended an all - nighter organized in @entity9 by the @entity11 @entity10 to celebrate @entity11 's democracy			2
two large screens relayed @entity0 's coverage while a succession of speakers -- including a recently re-elected @entity18 governor -- took to the stage to reflect on @entity11 and its democratic ideals			2
outside the hall sat a mock polling booth , where guests filled a ballot paper and dropped it in a box , watched over by life - size cardboard cut - outs of the two contenders			0
in the early hours of the morning the results were tallied and announced			0
@entity2 took 219 @entity18 votes , to @entity30 's 30			2
a friend standing with me when the results were announced could n't help wondering aloud who those 30 people were who had chosen @entity30 over @entity2			2
as i pointed out in a recent @entity0 piece , @entity18 , like the rest of @entity5 , have an " instinctive fondness " for mr. @entity2 , and for an obvious reason : he is a " son " of the continent -- his father was born in @entity43 ; his grandmother still lives there			1
just before i left the event , a friend observed that he still had n't found a single @entity18 who could point to any reason why they were rooting for @entity2 , beyond his @entity53 roots			1
that obsession with @entity2 appears to obscure the fact that his predecessor -- the white , @entity58 @entity56 -- demonstrated a more obvious commitment to the continent during his first presidential term			1
in 2003 , a few months after the @entity11 invasion of @entity62 , @entity56 signed into law a bill establishing the @entity11 president 's @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , in fulfilment of a promise made during his @entity69 earlier that year			1
under the terms of the plan , @entity56 pledged $ 15 billion towards fighting @entity72			2
in 2008 he renewed the commitment for another five years			0
before him , president @entity75 -- honored by the @entity76 , months after he left office , as @entity11 's " first @entity65 " -- created the @entity77 and @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , a landmark piece of legislation that opened up @entity11 markets to @entity53 countries			1
@entity2 , on the other hand , has demonstrated what has been interpreted as a studied detachment towards @entity5			1
his only visit in his first four years , to @entity88 in 2009 , lasted less than 24 hours			0
dr. @entity89 , director of the @entity9 - based @entity90 , argues that @entity2 is in a " conflicted position " -- compelled to exercise caution in his engagement with @entity5 " for fear that such a position will become ammunition in the hands of the lunatic right , @entity100 types and those who insist he is not an @entity11 and is really a @entity102			1
" but if the affection of the continent towards mr. @entity2 -- at an all time high in 2008 when he first took office -- has cooled in the last few years ( ostensibly as a response to his perceived nonchalance ) , his re-election appears to have reawakened the enthusiasm			2
" we look forward to the deepening of relations between our two countries during your second term in office , " @entity43 president @entity111 said in a congratulatory message			0
from @entity18 came a message by a presidential spokesperson , saying " president @entity122 looks forward to continuing to build on @entity18 and @entity5 's developmental collaboration with the @entity11 in the next four years			1
" with the pressure of re-election now gone , @entity89 says " the second term would be a more opportune time for @entity2 to work with @entity5			1
" while @entity129 visited the continent in 2011 , the least that many @entity53 will be expecting from @entity2 during his second term would be a powerfully symbolic visit of his own to @entity5			1
but that trip , if it ever happens , would be the easiest of the @entity5 - focused tasks in the @entity136 in - tray			0
and it would also do little to clarify the monumental complexity of dealing with a rapidly changing @entity53 landscape			0
for one , there 's @entity143 's aggressive engagement with the continent , which appears to be happening at the expense of countries like @entity11			2
in 2009 , @entity2 's first year in office , @entity143 overtook @entity11 as @entity5 's largest trading partner			1
@entity11 's discomfiture with that state of affairs bubbled to the surface most recently last august , when secretary of state @entity152 , during a visit to @entity154 , lamented that " the days of having outsiders come and extract the wealth of @entity5 for themselves , leaving nothing or very little behind , should be over in the 21st century			1
" there is also the aftermath of the @entity160			0
the murder of the @entity11 ambassador to @entity163 is evidence of how much things have changed in the region in the last two years			0
and then there is the rise of extremist @entity169 in @entity170			0
in january 2009 , @entity152 told a @entity172 committee that " combating @entity176 's efforts to seek safe havens in failed states in the @entity179 " would be a key part of @entity11 's @entity5 policy			2
the years since then have seen the rise of @entity181 in @entity18 , @entity5 's most populous nation , and of extremists in @entity183			0
last june , the @entity184 unveiled a new @entity5 strategy built around four " objectives " : @entity187			0
but it remains to be seen whether @entity2 will unveil an @entity5 project on a scale comparable to @entity79 and @entity66			1
not that he is obliged to , anyway			0
and with the @entity11 economy still in dire straits , and requiring full time attention , he is unlikely to get much backslapping at home for expending his energy on matters that have no direct bearing on @entity11 's near future			0
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity2 , " son " of @entity5 , remains *hugely* popular on the continent
@entity202 : @entity56 showed more commitment to @entity5 in first term than @entity2
@entity2 unlikely to see @entity11 *political* *benefit* in launching @entity53 aid programs
