@entity0 -- in the early hours of march 22 this year , cruise ship worker @entity2 made a mysterious phonecall			1
no one knows who she spoke to , or what the call was about			0
minutes later she hung up , walked away -- and apparently vanished without a trace			2
six months later , her parents still have no idea what happened to their 24 - year - old daughter on board the @entity16 ship as it sailed off the coast of @entity18			1
and like the loved ones of scores of others who have vanished from cruises in international waters , there is little they can do to find out			1
while millions of people around the world take cruises every year , at least 168 people have vanished from cruise ships and ferries in international waters since 1995 , according to the @entity33			1
maritime law states that crimes are to be investigated by police in the country where the ship is registered			1
so while @entity2 , who is @entity41 , went missing off the coast of @entity18 , her case was taken up in the @entity42 , where the @entity16 is registered			1
@entity2 's parents , @entity44 and @entity45 , were shocked to learn that rather than @entity47 or @entity41 police boarding the ship to gather evidence , @entity16 and then @entity42 law enforcement were to handle the investigation			1
the @entity51 flew to @entity52 where they were shown @entity55 footage of their daughter making a phone call in the early hours of the morning she went missing -- the only piece of evidence they 've been shown in the investigation into her disappearance , they say			0
" we do n't know what was in the phonecall and when she finished the call she just walked away , " @entity44 told @entity1			0
" that 's all we really know to this day			0
" a single police officer from the @entity42 flew into town but failed to interview any of the roughly 3,700 passengers and crewon the cruise ship -- and that appears to be the extent of the investigation into their daughter 's disappearance , her parents say			1
superintendent @entity80 of the @entity42 police told the @entity41 newspaper @entity82 : " i have been in touch with the family and have no further comment			0
" " we get very little information coming back to us as to what the investigation has found out , and that 's partly because of the problems of where the ship 's registered , " said @entity44			2
@entity2 's parents are demanding new regulations similar to a new @entity47 law which allows the @entity95 and @entity96 to investigate cases of missing @entity47 citizens regardless of where the ship is registered			1
" the law we want is what president @entity101 signed up to last year in the @entity47 , " said @entity44			0
" we want the same in the @entity41 and @entity104 and elsewhere			2
" the @entity105 have met with @entity41 shipping minister @entity106 , who has pledged to raise the issue with the @entity108 -- but progress has been slow			0
" it 's been absolutely awful , " said @entity110			0
" we just miss her desperately now -- it 's the longest we 've ever gone without seeing her , and it 's not getting any easier at all			0
" at the time of her disappearance a @entity16 spokeswoman said : " we have been doing everything possible to find @entity2 including conducting multiple shipboard searches			2
in addition , we have been working with all of the appropriate authorities			0
@entity2 's disappearance has been difficult for everyone at @entity124			1
" " we 've been in close contact with the @entity2 family , and we 're assisting them in any way we can			2
" @entity44 blames the culture of cruise ships , and not @entity16 or the @entity42 police , for the lack of action over @entity2 's disappearance			1
and with the recent news that the @entity41 cruise line company @entity136 is considering moving its ships ' registrations to a different country , even more cruise passengers could be exposed to the problems the @entity141 have faced			1
with little more support than that of their own family , the @entity105 say they are focused on finding out what happened to their daughter -- and preventing others from going through the same trauma			0
" we 've got to find out what 's happened to her -- you do n't just vanish off of a ship with all those people , " said @entity110			2
" we 'll keep on and keep strong for her until we find answers			0
