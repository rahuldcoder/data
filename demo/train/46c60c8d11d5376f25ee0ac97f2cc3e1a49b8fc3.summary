-- do you want to understand why president @entity2 is visiting @entity3 so early in his second term ? think of two words : management and legacy			1
right now in the cruel and unforgiving foreign policy world in which @entity10 is trapped , @entity2 stands to be the @entity10 president on whose watch two catastrophes loom : bomb @entity13 or see @entity13 with a bomb , and the demise of the two - state solution			1
@entity3 figures centrally in both issues			2
if the president is to manage these issues effectively , he needs to find a way to work with @entity22 and the new @entity3 government			1
that effort begins this week			0
since the state of @entity3 was created in 1948 , only four @entity10 presidents have visited the country while in office ( @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 43 )			2
and only one -- @entity30 -- achieved a truly significant result by brokering the terms of an @entity37 - @entity3 peace treaty that was signed at the @entity38 in march 1979			1
so a visit by an @entity10 president can be important ; but it is rare			0
the logic behind @entity2 's visit , however , is not to hammer out immediate results or to achieve a breakthrough in a box			1
@entity2 is already an historic president -- but he is not yet a great one			1
if he were to achieve that status , it would probably be through big pieces of domestic agenda such as health care , immigration reform , gun control , and of course , economic recovery			0
he 's unlikely to get there by chasing windmills abroad like @entity59 or @entity3 - @entity61 peace			1
@entity3 president : no doubt @entity2 has @entity3 's back still , he ca n't forget about the world , least of all the broken , angry and dysfunctional @entity64 that could cause him more headaches and undermine his domestic agendas if left unattended			1
the @entity13 nuclear issue could rattle regional stability , send markets plunging and oil prices rising			0
@entity2 needs a new approach			0
trying to repair his relationship with @entity22 is smart politics			1
if the president wants to regain control of the @entity38 in 2014 and take an issue away from the @entity79 in the process , he needs to remove the image that somehow he 's against @entity22 and does n't care emotionally about @entity3			1
an early trip to @entity3 that allows him a chance to connect is just what the doctor ordered			0
the president spent most of his first term unsure of whether to pander to @entity22 or pressure him			2
now , he can test to see if he and @entity22 can get on the same page			0
will it work ? @entity3 , of course , is n't the only actor in these stories			2
there are @entity13 and @entity61 , too			0
but working with @entity22 may give the president the time he needs to pursue diplomacy with @entity13 and perhaps a deal with the @entity61			2
the @entity3 election has weakened @entity22 and brought in new coalition partners who may well want to improve relations with a @entity10 president			1
@entity22 knows that his political career ca n't last forever			2
at the moment , he 's being challenged by two newcomers -- @entity106 and @entity107			0
@entity22 's best chance in regaining momentum is to shift the conversations to @entity13 and foreign policy where he 's strongest			2
and for this , paradoxically , he needs @entity2 's help			1
the @entity10 , @entity3 and the art of relationship maintenance moreover , next year @entity22 will have served longer than any other prime minister in @entity3 's history			1
he may be thinking about his legacy and avoiding the charge that he was a do - nothing leader			2
again , the @entity10 is the key ; and @entity22 ca n't afford to alienate @entity2			1
what makes all of this potentially realistic -- and not a fantasy -- is that the deals on the table are not transformational ones where weak and constrained leaders need to push for impossible goals or make decisions beyond their capacities			0
no grand bargains or conflict - ending agreements are possible now with the mullahs or between @entity3 and @entity61			2
there 's not enough confidence , too little trust , too much domestic politics and too many gaps on the big issues			0
but smaller deals may be possible			0
for example , the two leaders can pursue an interim approach that caps @entity13 's uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief which would give @entity13 and the international community a way out of the current choices -- bomb or allow @entity152 to get the bomb			0
on the @entity61 issue , the @entity3 and @entity61 can quietly explore with the @entity10 and with one another how much common ground they may have on the core final status issues while trying to improve the interim situation through security cooperation , loosening up of economic restrictions , and international support for @entity61 institutions			0
@entity3 minister says she hopes @entity10 helps restart peace talks none of these strategies are perfect , but they are starters			0
and so smartly and rightly , president @entity2 is going to @entity3 early ( when there are no expectations ) and with a view toward giving himself time to reshape his relationship with @entity22 , building one with the @entity3 public , and testing the proposition that he can try to develop some consensus in @entity3			1
fighting off and on over the past four years clearly has n't worked			1
maybe trying to cooperate over the next four just might			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

president @entity2 is visiting @entity3 , will meet with @entity22
@entity178 : @entity2 's attempt to repair relationship with @entity22 is smart
he says @entity22 is *mindful* of his legacy to avoid being seen as a do - nothing leader
@entity178 : fighting has n't worked before ; @entity2 and @entity22 can try to cooperate instead
