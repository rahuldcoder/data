editor 's note : since the @entity3 arrested a @entity5 businessman in late july on federal charges of organ trafficking , @entity2 has been conducting a worldwide investigation into the sale of kidneys using willing donors and willing recipients from @entity13 to @entity14 to the @entity15			1
@entity16 says he got $ 20,000 to donate his kidney and lied to the hospital 's transplant team			1
@entity20 , @entity14 ( @entity2 ) -- four years ago , a young , cash - starved @entity14 answered an ad in a newspaper for a kidney donor			1
" i decided i wanted to make a positive change in my life and do something different , " @entity16 told @entity2			1
" so i saw an ad in the paper and it said , ' @entity29			0
' and called the ad in the paper , and they asked me my blood type			0
" ultimately , @entity16 flew to @entity33 and underwent surgery at @entity35 to remove one of his two healthy kidneys			0
" let 's say i donated a kidney and received compensation , " he said			1
@entity16 's story is one of several that have come to light in recent weeks as part of a worldwide @entity2 investigation into what appears to be a widespread black market in human organs currently under scrutiny by authorities in the @entity15 and @entity14			1
@entity16 says he was paid $ 20,000 for his kidney -- something he admits he lied about in interviews with the hospital 's transplant team			1
watch @entity16 explain how he sold his kidney Â» what @entity16 did -- and what the man who received the kidney did -- violated a 1994 @entity15 federal law that forbids the selling or purchase of live organs for cash			1
he not only got his money , but made an 11 - minute documentary film he called " @entity68 " to show how easy it was to sell an organ			2
a portion of the documentary shows him lying on a bed , covered in cash he says he was paid			0
in a written statement , @entity35 told @entity2 : " the pre-transplant evaluation may not detect premeditated and skillful attempts to subvert and defraud the evaluation process			1
" " @entity35 's transplant screening process is rigorous and comprehensive , and assesses each donor 's motivation , " the hospital said			2
a hospital medical source put it more bluntly : " we were duped			2
" according to kidney transplant doctors , the process of pre-screening , blood - type matching and other related medical issues normally takes two months before any surgery			2
during that time , both recipient and doctor have to make several visits to a team of doctors , social workers and perhaps even ethicists before a final decision is made			0
hospitals often ask donors to sign documents which ask whether they have received any compensation for donating a kidney or other organ			1
but no documentation is required to prove a family connection			0
the chief of nephrology at @entity35 later said hospitals and doctors are primarily concerned with medicine			0
" we 're not detectives			0
we 're not the @entity3 , " dr. @entity113 said			0
" people can , on occasion , deceive us			0
" but what @entity16 did was not unique , according to the @entity117 , which says 10 percent of kidney transplants worldwide are believed to be illicit			1
dr. @entity119 , a leading kidney specialist , teacher and researcher at @entity123 in @entity5 , said the @entity15 leads the world in kidney transplants			1
about 16,000 of them are performed every year , he said			0
" that would mean that somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 transplants in the @entity15 might fall in the categorization of being illegal , " @entity119 said			1
he added , " i have had several experiences with patients with data that says they got a kidney from their brother , their sister or from their parent when they do n't have a brother or a sister , " dr. @entity119 told @entity2			1
" the transplant was performed under false circumstances			0
" and @entity119 said he 's been offered bribes of $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 by kidney brokers			1
" of course i was very happy to see them leave the office very rapidly , " he said			0
the extent of the underground network came to the surface in late july , when @entity3 agents arrested a @entity5 businessman on charges of organ trafficking			0
a federal complaint against @entity154 said he had offered to provide a new kidney for a relative of an undercover @entity3 agent for about $ 160,000			1
according to the complaint , @entity154 told the agent he could buy the kidney for about $ 5,000 and gave instructions on exact procedures and methods to avoid detection			1
the complaint quoted @entity154 as bragging : " so far , i 've never had a failure			0
" @entity165 , the attorney for @entity154 , told @entity2 he could not comment on the @entity3 complaint " because i have not had enough time to assess the information			1
" he said @entity2 's " assertions are incorrect , " and that law enforcement 's account of @entity154 's network was inaccurate			2
but law enforcement sources said @entity154 had been the centerpiece of a kidney - for - sale operation , which he called " @entity176 , " that operated extensively for nearly a decade			2
the donors and patients in this network were linked by one common theme -- they were @entity182			0
investigators say the donors usually came from @entity185 , were mostly poor and willing to sell their kidneys to @entity15 and @entity14 patients			2
according to one expert on organ trafficking , the @entity3 had been alerted to @entity154 's activities years ago			0
@entity191 , an anthropologist at the @entity192 and founder of a newsletter called " @entity195 , " said she had told the @entity3 about @entity154 and her suspicions about him seven years ago			0
" i think they thought it was a very few bad apples , " @entity191 said			0
the @entity3 said would not officially comment on her assertions , but an @entity3 source later said , " we developed our own leads			0
" according to @entity191 , the same day she spoke to @entity2 , she had learned of another illegal transplant surgery taking place at @entity205 in @entity206			1
the donor , she said , was a young @entity209 national who had received more than $ 25,000 for one of his kidneys			2
" this is a kid that does not speak much @entity214 , who is terrified and shaken , " she said			0
" and he thought , ' maybe i 've made a mistake to do this , but $ 25,000 is a good amount of cash			2
' " @entity191 said the cash had been handed over in two increments , with the second paid to a relative in a hospital bathroom			0
in a statement , @entity205 spokeswoman @entity226 said living donors " must state they are not receiving payment for their kidney			0
" " if at any time during the evaluation process , the transplant team suspects the donor is inappropriately being paid for a kidney , the transplant is canceled , " she said			0
but a hospital source later told @entity2 , " we do not give lie - detector tests to our patients			1
" according to @entity191 , who is in the final stages of writing a book on organ trafficking , much of the world 's illicit traffic in kidneys can be traced to @entity14			2
" @entity14 is the top , " she said			2
" it has tentacles reaching out worldwide			0
" until march 2008 , @entity14 law allowed @entity14 citizens to go abroad for live organ transplants from non-related donors			1
but there was no way for @entity14 authorities to keep track of how many of those cases involved money changing hands , the country 's @entity254 said			1
@entity14 investigators are looking intensively at illegal organ trafficking under the new law , the ministry said			1
and prosecutors in @entity268 sent nine @entity14 to jail in 2007 after uncovering a black - market ring that was buying and selling organs			1
@entity272 , the assistant district attorney for @entity14 's @entity273 , said he was shocked by the case			2
secretly recorded conversations showed that @entity277 and @entity278 newspapers were targeting low - income @entity14 and @entity280 with ads saying there would be payment in exchange for providing a kidney			1
" the idea was the people were calling out of despair , out of urgent need who needed a quick way to make money , " he said .			0
