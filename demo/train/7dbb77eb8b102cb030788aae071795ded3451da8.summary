-- the @entity1 is at a strategic inflection point			1
the choices we make now will have an enormous effect on our national security for decades			0
the war in @entity8 has ended , and we have begun a transition in @entity10 that will lead to a smaller @entity1 commitment in 2014 and beyond			2
on the horizon , we can see the end of a decade of war			0
but as we look to the future , a very different but still daunting set of challenges confronts us : the rise of @entity19 and shifting power dynamics in @entity21 ; the unfolding promise and perils of the @entity24 ; @entity26 's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and the risks of conflict and proliferation it could spark ; the near demise of @entity33 's leadership in @entity34 and the emergence of dangerous regional affiliates in places such as @entity38 ; growing cyberthreats and new technologies and operational concepts that are transforming warfare			0
even more daunting , we must address these challenges at a time of severe budgetary austerity and profound political paralysis			0
after more than a decade of deficit spending , mounting national debt and the global financial crisis , we must shore up the @entity1 economy as the foundation of our prosperity and security			1
this will require hard choices to bring government spending and revenues into balance while still investing in the long - term drivers of @entity1 economic competitiveness			1
republicans and @entity62 have been unable to reach consensus on how to make these hard choices , bringing @entity65 to a standstill			1
the super committee 's failure to reach agreement on deficit reduction highlighted another more worrisome deficit -- one of political courage , vision and classic @entity1 pragmatism			1
these qualities are sorely needed at a time when partisan ideological discipline seems to have trumped the other nobler forms of discipline that have made this country great			0
in this context , @entity1 must decide what kind of military we need for the future			1
the @entity86 requires the @entity87 to reduce its expenditures by about $ 487 billion over the next decade , $ 259 billion of which must be cut over the next five years			0
in practical terms , this means the base defense budget will be about 9 % smaller than planned , while spending on overseas contingency operations also declines			2
in order to determine how best to sustain @entity1 's global leadership in this time of austerity , the @entity94 administration conducted a defense review based on four key principles : first , the @entity1 must maintain the world 's finest military , one that supports and sustains our unique leadership role in the world			1
second , the @entity87 must avoid the mistakes of past drawdowns , which have resulted in a " hollow force			2
" a smaller , ready and well - equipped military is preferable to a larger force without adequate investment in readiness and modernization			1
third , everything must be on the table , including politically sensitive areas that will likely provoke opposition from some members of @entity65 , industry and advocacy groups			2
there can be no sacred cows			0
fourth , we must preserve the quality of our all - volunteer force and keep faith with our men and women in uniform and their families , particularly after a decade of such great sacrifice on their part			1
these principles shaped the @entity87 's @entity136 defense budget request , which envisions a smaller force that is highly flexible , agile and -- above all -- ready to conduct the full spectrum of missions			1
importantly , the review called for a strategic rebalancing toward @entity142 , the region that will have the greatest impact on @entity1 economic and security interests long term			2
this does not mean taking our eye off the ball in the @entity150 or turning our back on allies in @entity153			0
it does mean increasing our presence , access and partnerships in @entity21 , particularly @entity158 and the @entity159			0
it also means increasing investment in capabilities that can ensure @entity1 power projection in contested environments and protecting low - cost , high - impact programs that build the capacity of critical partners in other regions to address shared challenges			1
at the same time , the @entity87 is protecting investment in areas critical to the future , including : @entity174 ; unmanned intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ; cybersecurity ; counter-wmd measures ; and long - range precision strike			0
great care was also taken to ensure that the @entity1 military will remain able to deal effectively with aggression in more than one theater at a time			2
this standard has long been a pillar of @entity1 strategy and is essential for a global power with global interests , let alone the world 's indisputable leader and ally of choice			1
nevertheless , the @entity1 will no longer size its ground forces for sustained , large - scale counterinsurgency and stability operations			2
both the @entity198 and the @entity199 had to grow over the past decade to sustain multiple rotations to @entity8 and @entity10			0
as this decade of war winds down , these forces are being reset to be ready to respond to a wider range of scenarios			0
lastly , the @entity87 has planned for " reversibility " -- that is , the ability to surge , regenerate and mobilize to counter any threat around the world			0
given our poor track record in predicting past wars , we must be able to adjust quickly if and when we get it wrong			0
this concept is shaping the department 's investment in areas ranging from the @entity217 and reserves , to the number of experienced leaders it retains , to the industrial base			0
in sum , this administration has put a smart , strategy - driven and fiscally responsible blueprint for the @entity1 military on the table			1
now , the onus is on the @entity65 to exercise the discipline , pragmatism and political courage to reach a budget deal that avoids sequestration and its devastating effects on our national security			1
join us on @entity238 / @entity237 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : as wars wind down , @entity1 faces hard choices on defense spending
she says global power shifts *prompted* @entity94 administration defense review
she says @entity1 must keep strong , small , ready military and keep faith with volunteer force
@entity241 : @entity65 must have courage , agree on budget , avoid across - the - board cuts
