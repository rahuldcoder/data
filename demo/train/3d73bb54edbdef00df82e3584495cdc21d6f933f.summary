the top @entity3 leading the charge against @entity5 is now signed up for it and will take thousands of dollars in government support to help with its costs , a spokesman for @entity2 speaker @entity1 confirmed to @entity9			1
@entity1 's premiums for his new plan under the @entity12 will nearly double from his current monthly payments , even with the federal contribution			1
all of this was set in motion last week when the speaker enrolled for coverage on the @entity19 exchange established under the health reforms championed by president @entity21 but opposed by @entity3 on @entity22			1
@entity1 said the experience was " pretty frustrating " and his office sent pictures of him trying to log onto the website , the rocky rollout of which has been a rallying point for renewed @entity3 criticism of the law as unworkable			1
once he got through the system , @entity1 's office said he chose an individual plan that was similar to the @entity35 one he has now as part of the federal employees health package			1
if members of @entity40 want health coverage facilitated by the government acting as their employer , they now must sign up with @entity5			2
@entity1 saw an eye - popping jump in cost as he moved from a plan set up for millions of federal workers to the @entity19 exchange , which is designed for small businesses and individuals			1
the current cost for @entity1 and his wife ? they " pay a monthly premium of $ 433 , " said @entity1 spokesman @entity54			2
the new plan for the two of them ? it " would cost $ 802 per month in premiums , " @entity54 said			2
that is an 85 % leap			0
but , @entity1 's wife is about to go on @entity65 , so he will get an individual plan			1
that cost ? $ 449 a month			0
@entity1 's office notes he will now be paying more for one person in the @entity5 exchange than he was for two people in the federal employees plan			1
deductibles for the @entity74 will jump from $ 700 to about $ 2,000			0
why did @entity1 's premium go up so much ? one reason , his age			1
@entity5 sign - up concerns congressional staff under the @entity12 , health insurers can no longer set different prices based on health			2
the law instead gives just a few variables they can consider			0
at the top of that list is age			0
many congressional staffers were shocked to see how much more a 60 - year - old staffer would pay for the same plan than a 26 - year - old colleague			0
" the monthly formula for older workers is a serious , serious hit , " one congressional employee said at the time			0
" in addition to what i 'm paying now , it will be another $ 300 to $ 400 a month			0
" @entity1 , who turned 64 last week , is at the upper end of the age spectrum for @entity5			1
at 65 , members can sign up for @entity65			0
many may point out that he is also a smoker , a condition for which insurers could charge more under the law			0
but , @entity1 may be in luck			2
the @entity19 exchange has ruled smoking should be considered a pre-existing condition and insurers in that market can not increase premiums because of it			2
but the biggest help for the speaker is a contribution offered to federal workers on the @entity19 exchange to help with premiums			2
private employers pick up some of the cost for their employees as well			0
@entity1 's office confirms he will accept the contribution , despite his public push against such assistance for plans covering members of @entity40			1
he will receive $ 5,113 in federal premium support over the next year			0
when asked why his boss is accepting the contribution now , @entity1 spokesman @entity133 told @entity9 that " @entity19 @entity136 chose not to make that change			0
" @entity9 pointed out that several other members of @entity40 chose to return their premium support to the @entity140			0
@entity1 's office did not respond further when asked whether he considered that option			1
@entity142 : @entity5 website ' on track ' to meet nov. 30 goal @entity2 pushes back on @entity5 reports @entity9 analysis : no @entity5 subsidy for some @entity5 site 's @entity149 shelved @entity5 playbook : spread negative perception			1
