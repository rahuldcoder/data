-- @entity2 monarchs appear to be falling like dominoes			0
queen @entity4 set the ball rolling in april 2013 when she stepped down in favor of her son and heir prince @entity9 following a 33 - year reign			1
in july 2013 , 79 - year - old @entity11 gave up his throne citing advancing age and health issues , and now comes word that @entity16 of @entity17 , 76 , has decided to abdicate after a reign that has spanned almost four decades			1
the popularity of the @entity17 monarchy has nose - dived in recent years			2
@entity16 's secret luxury trip to @entity22 to hunt elephants at the height of his country 's financial crisis in 2012 did n't help ... especially given his role as honorary president of the @entity29			1
then there 's the ongoing investigation of his son - in - law , @entity32 , who faces preliminary charges of embezzling millions of euros in public funds through his charity			2
through his lawyer , @entity32 has denied the charges , which could still be dropped			0
add to that the king 's slew of health issues -- five operations over the course of two years -- and it seems rather a sensible decision to hand over to his son , prince @entity46 , 46 , who has seen his own popularity steadily increase			0
while @entity16 's abdication comes as no surprise , it does beg the question : will @entity53 's @entity52 follow suit ? she has after all put in an impressive tenure , 62 years to be precise ( today marks the 61st anniversary of her coronation )			1
she 's currently enjoying a surge in popularity -- always better to go out on top -- and at 88 she has surely earned the right to put her feet up and bask in her twilight years			0
so will we see her throw in the towel next ? in a word , no. in 1947 , on the occasion of her 21st birthday , during a tour with her parents to @entity71 , a then princess @entity52 made a pledge in a broadcast to the @entity74 in which she said : " i declare before you all that my whole life , whether it be long or short , shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong			1
" in a speech to both houses of parliament commemorating her @entity85 in 2012 , the queen rededicated herself to her country and its people , vowing to serve , " ... now and in the years to come			2
" the queen is a deeply religious woman , and in 1953 she took her oath before @entity90			0
for her that means a lifetime of commitment			0
due to her advancing age , prince @entity94 has stepped in to represent his mother at several high profile engagements over the last year , most notably at the @entity98 in @entity99 last november , but this by no means indicates that he 's planning a coup			0
@entity52 continues to fulfill a jam - packed royal schedule and will travel to @entity104 later this week to mark the @entity106 commemorations alongside her " strength and stay " prince @entity108 who will celebrate his 93rd birthday next week			2
the @entity52 is for all intents and purposes the royal equivalent of the @entity113 and the only way she will ever step aside is if she becomes incapacitated			1
come september 2015 , @entity52 will surpass @entity52 @entity116 's record as @entity53 's longest reigning monarch , and if one was to think optimistically , should she live to the ripe old age of 108 , she would break former @entity120 of @entity122 's reign as the world 's longest serving monarch			1
while that is a record that stands to remain unbroken , you can rest assured that as long as she remains healthy , the queen is not going anywhere , and for that we should be immensely proud and grateful			0
i quit , says king who defied coup @entity16 : all you need to know @entity134 's @entity11 gives up throne to son the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			1

@entity16 has announced he is abdicating after almost four decades on @entity17 's throne
it follows the 2013 abdications of @entity134 's @entity11 and the @entity146 ' queen @entity4
@entity148 says @entity52 swore on her 21st birthday to serve her whole life
@entity53 's @entity52 , @entity148 says , would only step down were she incapacitated
