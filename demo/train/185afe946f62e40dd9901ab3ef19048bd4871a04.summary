so where , exactly , is @entity1 ? president @entity2 knows			1
but @entity4 's chief snooper is n't telling			1
the @entity6 officer and master of doublespeak described @entity1 as a " free man " ( biding his time in a " transit area " in @entity14 's @entity13 airport			1
so free , of course , that the young @entity17 ex-surveillance officer -- watched around the clock by hawkish @entity4 security agents - has become as ubiquitously and transparently invisible as the brightly lit subject of a dystopian @entity22 story			1

the truth is that anyone who uses the @entity25 is also all in that brightly lit " transit area			2
" i 'm afraid we are all in danger of becoming @entity1 now			1
" mr. @entity1 really did fly into @entity14 , " @entity2 said , with just the glimmer of a secret policeman 's smile			1
" for us it was completely unexpected			2
" oh , yes , it must have been totally unexpected			0
so unexpected , indeed , that the area between passport control and the arrival gates in @entity13 airport has been transformed into a high security hotel designed to both shield @entity1 from public view and to watch him			1
yes , @entity45 is beginning to mirror the @entity25 , a vast all - seeing digital panopticon , a network in which somebody might be watching everything we do , a place where individual privacy no longer exists			0
and @entity1 's fate -- of being watched around the clock , of having zero privacy -- could easily become all of our fates			1
opinion : in digital age , everyone is becoming a spook ironically , it 's @entity1 himself who has most clearly revealed to us our fate			1
in secret @entity67 ( @entity67 ) documents which @entity1 gave to the @entity70 newspaper , we now know that for more than two years , the @entity72 administration allowed the @entity67 , to continue -- as the newspaper put it -- " collecting vast amounts of records detailing the email and internet usage of @entity17			1
" doublespeak is n't , of course , unique to the @entity4 security apparatchik			1
the @entity17 are pretty skilled at it too			0
" i 'm not going to say we 're not collecting any internet metadata , " thus one @entity84 official told the @entity85			0
but , as the @entity70 notes , the distinction between metadata and data is mostly semantic			0
the truth is that the @entity67 has been data - mining us all of us to death -- americans and foreigners alike -- in their paranoid search for enemies of the @entity17 state			0
last year i wrote a book warning about this and called it " @entity100 " -- in homage to @entity103 's nightmarish movie about a @entity105 private eye whose life is destroyed by both surveillance and voyeurism			2
some people said i was exaggerating			0
now they know i was n't			0
by being able to read our emails and internet usage , by harvesting over a trillion metadata records , the @entity67 knows absolutely everything about us			0
they know our tastes , what we think , where we go , what we eat , how we sleep , when we are angry , when we are sad			0
they have become our eyes and our brains			0
@entity103 's 20th century movie about surveillance and voyeurism really has become the truth about 21st century digital life			2
more from @entity126 : should we fear mind - reading future tech ? it 's almost as if the agents at the @entity67 have become as omniscient as @entity131 or @entity132			1
the really terrifying thing about @entity1 's revelations is the doublethink articulated by the @entity137 technology companies whose pipes and platforms have been hijacked by the snooping @entity67 bureaucrats			1
@entity131 , @entity132 and the rest all , of course , claim , in the sophisticatedly obtuse doublespeak of their lawyers , both ignorance and innocence about the @entity67 allegations			2
but , as @entity153 founder @entity152 notes , the truth about @entity137 's complicity is this horror story is much murkier , much more like the dark transit area in @entity13 airport where @entity2 's spooks are monitoring @entity1 's every movement			1
@entity137 's fetish with radical transparency , with encouraging us to broadcasting everything we do and think , is destroying our privacy			0
and without privacy , i warn , our individuality , the very thing that defines us as unique human - beings , is fatally compromised			0
@entity1 's fate , whether he ends up in @entity170 or @entity171 or stays in @entity13 airport , is to be watched by spooks for the rest of his life			1
@entity1 , the " free man " in @entity2 's doublespeak , will never truly be alone again			2
to avoid becoming @entity1 , we need to be much more critical of the invasiveness of @entity137 's big data companies			2
we must recognize the creepiness of all - seeing location devices like @entity180			2
most of all , we need to remember that the @entity25 is never really private so our most intimate thoughts are best kept to ourselves			0
remaining free in our digital age requires us to be alone			0
we have to teach the internet how to forget			0
we must build an off - switch to the internet , to reinvent it as a dark space , a place where nobody can know what anyone else is doing .			0

@entity1 is stuck in the transit zone in @entity14 , watched by @entity4 security *services*
@entity126 : presumably it is his fate to be watched for the rest of his life wherever he ends up
@entity126 says we are with him , as we *embrace* devices that monitor all our activities
