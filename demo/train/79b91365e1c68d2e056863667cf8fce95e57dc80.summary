-- it 's one of the top 10 most - visited sites worldwide , with over 2 million articles in its @entity5 language edition			1
but is online encyclopedia @entity8 's strength -- that anyone can edit it -- also its greatest weakness ? @entity8 : an invaluable repository of global knowledge or a magnet for digital vandals and hoaxers ? this june , former president of the @entity18 , @entity16 hit out at academics who endorsed the use of @entity8 to their students , saying in the @entity24 blog that " a professor who encourages the use of @entity8 is the intellectual equivalent of a dietician who recommends a steady diet of @entity30 with everything			1
" @entity16 added that @entity32 and @entity8 were creating a generation of " intellectual sluggards incapable of moving beyond the @entity35 , " with no interest in exploring non-digital resources			1
@entity16 's remarks received a mixed response			2
some said that students should be taught to discern whether a source was authoritative			0
others pointed to academics who cite @entity8 , saying it was unfair to prevent students from doing the same			1
@entity48 , research fellow in the center for computing and social responsibility at @entity52 , @entity53 , was quoted in the @entity54 saying that @entity35 resources had made research more efficient and removed some of the " drudgery out of producing good work			0
" @entity16 's position was that he was not taking issue with the technology per se , but was concerned by the lack of peer review based on an intellectual meritocracy , adding , " that meritocracy must be based on respect for expertise and learning			0
" perhaps surprisingly , this view is shared by @entity71 , who was with @entity8 from the start and is often referred to as a co-founder			1
( though that 's up for debate on the site , too			2
) when he parted ways with @entity8 , @entity71 felt that the site 's vulnerability to vandalism could undermine its reputation			1
that spurred him to set up " @entity83 , " a rival wiki - based project where articles are vetted by known experts and authors are required to use their real names			0
@entity83 launched this year with the aim to become " the world 's most trusted knowledge base , " though with just 3000 articles to hold to @entity8 's 2 million , some would question whether the site can ever catch up			1
for the most part , @entity8 is working			2
a 2005 study by @entity99 journal @entity100 found that the online encyclopedia was about as accurate as its competitors on science			1
but a commonly cited peril of @entity8 's anonymity is vandalism			1
in one notorious example , journalist @entity107 was listed as a suspect in both @entity111 assassinations by a prankster : the entry remained up for four months in 2005			0
such abuse tends to get quickly swept away by the site 's volunteers , especially if an article has been placed on a watch list by editors who are interested in the subject			1
still , at any given point , @entity8 visitors ca n't be sure of what they 're getting			2
look no further than the @entity107 entry : for 31 hours last september , he was said to have killed and eaten @entity126			0
@entity107 slammed the site in an opinion piece in @entity129 , berating @entity8 's " volunteer vandals with poison - pen intellects			1
" some might say that the edits in @entity107 's profile would never have made it into the mainstream media			0
but those seeking proof of just how much emphasis even professional journalists can place on @entity8 need look no further than the example of @entity141 , a @entity99 composer of tv theme tunes for shows including " yes , minister " and " @entity145 , " who died this october			1
according to several high - profile obituaries , including the @entity148 , @entity149 , the @entity150 and @entity151 , @entity152 , at the age of 72 , also penned " reach , " a 2000 hit for @entity157 pop combo @entity155			0
the unfortunate writers had omitted to double - check his @entity8 discography , and collectively fell victim to wiki - hoaxers			1
even those who spot errors in their own profiles can be reluctant to address them			0
in april this year , @entity167 - winning author and academic @entity168 told the @entity170 of his @entity8 entry , " [ it ] is filled with inaccuracies , and it kind of depresses me			1
" when asked why he did n't fix it , he replied , " the next day someone will fix it back			0
" @entity8 recognizes that to - and - fro tussling -- or " edit warring " -- is damaging to its reputation , and some of the more controversial topics -- such as those on @entity181 , @entity182 and abortion -- have been locked to limit who can alter them			1
but as its reputation as an online resource has grown , the encyclopedia has also become a target for corporate spin			1
in january this year , the @entity190 reported that @entity191 had offered a blogger cash to alter @entity8 articles			2
@entity191 claimed that the articles contained inaccuracies on an open - source document standard and a rival format put forward by the software giant			0
then , this summer , @entity199 , a 24 - year - old @entity200 graduate student , unearthed some eyebrow - raising data			1
@entity202 reported in august that @entity199 created an application called @entity204 that tracks edits that have been made to @entity8 articles and cross-references them against ip addresses , which can be traced back to companies ' offices			2
@entity199 proved what many had suspected for some time : that edits on company profiles were often originating from ip addresses owned by those companies and even their competitors			0
just a few of the corporations listed included @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity191 and @entity221 , along with several politicians ' offices			0
" " it was dead easy , " @entity199 told @entity224			0
" i just combined two databases and -- poof -- you have these public relations disasters			0
" some of those edits , @entity230 reported , appeared to be " transparently self - interested , either adding positive , press release - like material to entries , or deleting whole swaths of critical material			0
" @entity230 cited the example of voting - machine company @entity238 , " with someone at the company 's ip address apparently deleting long paragraphs detailing the security industry 's concerns over the integrity of their voting machines , and information about the company 's ceo 's fund - raising for president @entity249			0
" the deleted text was restored by a @entity8 contributor , who added : " please stop removing content from @entity8			2
" so should we turn our backs on @entity8 -- scratch it and start again ? absolutely not			1
as a project -- to gather together our collective knowledge -- @entity8 is admirable			1
as a repository for human knowledge , it is invaluable			0
as an introductory resource on anything from scientific formulae to walk - on characters in tv sitcoms , its breadth is unmatched			0
its content is also a priceless reflection of humanity and its concerns			0
only a tiny fraction of its vast repository is polluted by vandals , hoaxers and ne'er - do - wells , who in turn are chased down by its dedicated band of editors and administrators			2
but a resource that can be edited by experts and non-experts alike will always carry risks , and perhaps that 's @entity8 's greatest lesson for us all : that its very existence must force us to question notions of accuracy and reliability , while giving us a means to correct errors and add to the global knowledge pot. two things are certain : no encyclopedia will ever be perfect , and we will never reach consensus on all @entity8 articles			1
and in the meantime , while an invaluable first port of call , those using @entity8 would be well advised to confirm their facts elsewhere			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... do you take @entity8 at face value , or with a pinch of salt ? should we learn from the experts , or does each of us have a part to play ? share your views and read others ' thoughts in the @entity316 forum			2
