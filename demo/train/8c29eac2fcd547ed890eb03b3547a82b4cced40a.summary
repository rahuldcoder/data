-- @entity1 ! celebrity controversies ! endless self - congratulation ! what , you think sunday 's @entity5 are about the movies and the fashion ? yes , there is quite a race between best picture contenders " 12 years a slave , " " gravity " and " @entity13			1
" ( there are six other nominees , but they 're not expected to make waves			2
) @entity17 2014 : @entity5 ballot however , the @entity5 are full of unexpected moments -- whether it 's a host 's divisive jokes , a winner making political points or simply awkward stage approaches			1
here are five things to watch for : 1			2
" 12 years " and @entity5 diversity			1
a number of films from 2013 were rightly touted as showcasing @entity29 , including " @entity30 , " " 42 , " " @entity31 " and " @entity32 : @entity33			2
" @entity34 even highlighted the diversity on its @entity37 cover			2
but excepting " @entity32 , " which earned a best song nomination , the only one of those films to get any @entity5 love was " 12 years a slave , " about the experience of a free man taken into slavery			1
its studio , @entity47 , has run ads that say " it 's time , " a simple phrase that has multiple meanings			2
will the message carry the day ? we 'll find out sunday			2
@entity1 received kudos for her first @entity5 hosting stint in 2007 -- " crisp and unpretentious , " in the words of tv critic @entity60			1
since then , she has only become more popular , with her top - rated daytime tv show and 25.2 million @entity63 followers			2
she 'll be nice , of course , but maybe a little pointed			0
" i do think it should be classy			0
it 's the @entity5 , " she told @entity66			1
" ( but ) it has lately turned into something that 's a little more about the clothes than the performances , and i will comment on that			0
" and who knows ? the married and openly gay @entity73 may have something to say about the recent debate over same - sex marriage laws			0
some @entity5 nights seem to be all about momentum , with one film sweeping its way to best picture			1
other @entity5 nights spread the wealth			1
you may want to keep an eye on certain categories to see which way the wind is blowing			0
2014 @entity5 predictions moreover , it could be a big night for a few individuals in particular			1
with her fourth win , best actress nominee @entity94 , who now has 18 nominations , could tie @entity97 as the performer with the most @entity5 wins			1
best supporting actress nominee @entity100 could be the first performer to win back - to - back @entity5 in different categories ( best actress , and best supporting actress )			1
and with an @entity5 victory , best song nominee @entity104 , who co-wrote " @entity106 's " " @entity105 , " will become an @entity108 -- a winner of an @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity5 and @entity112			1
he would become just the 12th person to do so competitively			0
controversy ! if @entity115 wins best actress for " @entity117 " -- as she 's widely expected to do -- will she thank the film 's director , @entity118 ? she was called out in @entity121 's open letter and has been diplomatic when asked about the controversy , but did n't mention @entity118 in her acceptance speech at the @entity125 @entity124			2
then there 's the " @entity128 " segment			0
if the @entity130 is essentially a gigantic outrage machine , then nothing gets people angrier than having their favorite performer left out of the academy 's annual tribute to the deceased			0
who will it be this year ? @entity137 ? @entity138 ? @entity139 , the crew member who was killed in a @entity141 train accident ? and will there be complaints over who gets the " anchor " position ? 5			0
sing it ! in recent years , the best song race has been little more than a footnote to the @entity5 proceedings			1
( two years ago , there were just two nominees -- total			0
) but this year is shaping up to be an interesting competition			0
you 've got @entity104 and his tune , sung by @entity157 , which hit @entity160 's @entity159			0
you 've got rock heavyweights @entity161 , who wrote and performed " @entity163 , " from " @entity32 : @entity33			0
" you 've got indie darling @entity164 , who performed " @entity166 " from " her , " and be-hatted @entity167 , the mastermind behind " @entity169 's " " @entity168			0
" in other words , you 've got four songs people have actually heard -- and like			0
you almost might want to keep an eye on space and time			2
space , because the weather in @entity178 has been rainy			0
the precipitation is expected to let up by sunday afternoon , but if it does n't , the rainswept streets might make @entity181 proud			0
and time , because it 's the @entity5 : " two hours of sparkling entertainment spread over a four - hour show , " as @entity182 once said			1
of course , if it 's an entertaining show , nobody will notice -- except those people who use the show 's running time as an @entity5 pool tiebreaker			1
back to you , @entity1 .			1

@entity5 2014 feature a tight race for best picture
" @entity198 " shows off diversity , but will it win ?
@entity1 hosting a second time
*oscars* often bring controversy , the unexpected
