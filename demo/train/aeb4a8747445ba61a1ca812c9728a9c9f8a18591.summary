@entity0 -- a two - year legal battle over who was responsible for @entity5 's sudden death came to a dramatic close monday as a @entity7 jury found dr. @entity8 guilty of involuntary manslaughter			1
dr. @entity8 appeared to show no emotion as the verdict was read by court clerk @entity13 , but @entity14 , the late pop icon 's sister , let out a loud , but short , scream			1
a loud celebration erupted among @entity5 fans outside of the downtown @entity0 courthouse , where emotions ran so high at least one woman fainted			0
@entity8 was immediately handcuffed and taken away by deputies after @entity24 judge @entity23 denied bail			1
" this is not a crime involving a mistake of judgment			0
... this was a crime where the end result was the death of a human being , " @entity23 said in explaining his decision to remand @entity8 to police custody			1
" that factor demonstrates rather dramatically that the public should be protected			0
" sentencing was set for november 29 , with @entity8 facing up to four years in prison on the conviction			1
defense attorney @entity42 told @entity1 the defense team 's main job right now is to prepare for sentencing and limit the amount of time that @entity8 spends in jail			1
" what matters most right now is trying to keep dr. @entity8 from taking up a prison cell in this community , " @entity50 said			1
" that 's what we 're focusing on right now and we 'll deal with an appeal after that			0
" when asked if he was shocked by the verdict , @entity50 said , " no. " another of @entity8 's lawyers , @entity63 , told @entity1 on monday night the outcome may have been different had the defense been able to introduce additional evidence -- like on @entity5 's past drug use and " financial condition			1
" @entity63 described his client as " devastated " by the verdict , adding @entity8 is trying to stay positive with more legal options ahead of him			1
" we 're hoping that the appeals court will have something to say about this , " the lawyer said			0
@entity8 served as @entity5 's personal physician as @entity5 prepared for his comeback concerts , with @entity8 giving him the surgical anesthetic propofol to help him sleep nearly every night for the last two months of his life , according to testimony			1
@entity5 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was caused by " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with two sedatives , the @entity0 coroner ruled			0
the verdict followed about nine hours of jury deliberations , which began friday morning in the downtown @entity0 courthouse			2
@entity0 district attorney @entity89 thanked jurors " for their hard work and thoughtful deliberation , " and expressed gratitude that they recognized the " overwhelming " evidence against @entity8 in finding him guilty			1
prosecutor @entity96 personally expressed his sympathies to the @entity5 family who he said lost " not a pop icon , but a son and brother			0
" fans gathered outside of the courthouse ahead of the verdict with signs of support for @entity5 including one banner that read , " we miss @entity5			0
" the crowd began celebrating once word of the guilty verdict reached them , chanting " rest in peace			2
" passing cars honked their horns , as people nearby hugged , cried and yelled out in joy			0
an emotional @entity14 on monday thanked all those involved in the trial , calling the decision a " victory			0
" " everybody was wonderful , " @entity14 told @entity123 's @entity122 as she left the @entity0 courthouse			0
crowd outside erupts in jubilations the seven men and five women on the jury heard 49 witnesses over 23 days , including @entity8 's girlfriends and patients , @entity5 's former employees , investigators and medical experts for each side			1
a statement released by @entity5 's estate monday said that " justice has been served			0
" defense lawyers contended the matter was a negligence case that should instead be heard by the state medical board			2
" if it were anybody else but @entity5 , would this doctor be here today ? " lead defense lawyer @entity42 asked in his closing			0
jurors were left to decide if the propofol overdose was infused into @entity5 's blood by a steady intravenous drip , as the prosecution contended , or if @entity5 injected himself using a syringe left nearby by @entity8 , as the defense argued			1
" he was just a little fish in a big , dirty pond , " @entity50 said , pointing the finger at other doctors who treated @entity5 , and @entity5 himself			0
deputy district attorney @entity160 attacked the defense for trying to blame " everybody but @entity8 , poor @entity8			2
" " if allowed more time to argue , i am sure they would find a way to blame @entity5 's son , @entity165 , " @entity96 said in his closing rebuttal			2
@entity96 painted @entity8 as a selfish doctor who agreed to take $ 150,000 a month to give @entity5 nightly infusions of propofol in his home , something prosecutors argued an ethical doctor would never do because of the dangers			2
@entity8 's license to practice medicine is now suspended , according to the @entity175 , which decides if a doctor can legally work in the state			1
in the light of the conviction , the board now will open an investigation to determine whether or not to fully revoke @entity8 's right to practice medicine in the state , spokeswoman @entity178 said			1
the main criteria in deciding whether to revoke , suspend or take other action against any doctor is assessing how substantial a crime is related to the practice of medicine			0
there is no timeline as to when the board might act regarding @entity8 , said @entity178			2
@entity1 's @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
