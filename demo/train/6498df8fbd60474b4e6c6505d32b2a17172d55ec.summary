-- @entity1 flips through hundreds of job applications he 's filled out during the last 20 months of unemployment			1
" i feel that i am going to get a job , " he says			1
" i just feel it in my bones and my spirit that i am going to get a job			1
... it 's just a matter of when			2
" fields , 59 , is an @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , with a bachelor 's degree who has been unemployed since february 2009			1
he was let go from his job as a vice president at a large insurance brokerage firm			1
he had worked there for more than 25 years			2
he is also a devout @entity18 with an enormous amount of faith that he soon will be employed again			2
unfortunately , there are a slew of statistics that suggest his optimism may be unwarranted			1
" it 's been a devastating recession for @entity29 society			2
we have n't seen unemployment rates like this since the ' 40s or around the @entity35 , " says @entity30 , co-author of " @entity31 : @entity36 on @entity37			2
" " for african - americans , it 's been a tsunami			1
it 's been just a catastrophic event			0
" for black male college graduates 25 and older , the unemployment rate is 7.8 percent , as of august , according to the @entity45			1
it 's 4.4 percent for white male college graduates older than 25			1
the unemployment rate for whites was 8.7 percent in september , according to the @entity45			0
for blacks , it was 16.1 percent			0
the difference is often explained by a lack of college education among many blacks			1
but even college - educated blacks are unemployed at a higher rate than whites			1
" the college - educated black population is still predominantly in government jobs , which we 've seen a lot of cutbacks , " @entity30 says			1
" they 're predominantly in the retail sector and they 're in parts of the corporate sector that are the first to go			0
and this is one of the issues that we have : that our highly educated african - americans are still getting trained in areas that are most vulnerable in the economy			1
they 're not the dynamic , growing parts of the economy			0
" the unemployment rate does n't tell the whole story			0
the @entity80 also issues an employment - population ratio , which tracks what percentage of a given population is employed			1
a little more than 64 percent of black males were employed in december 2007 when the recession began			1
by last month , that figure had dropped to 56.9 percent			0
while not all of the people represented in that drop are involuntarily out of a job , a significant portion are			1
economist @entity92 says the employment - population ratio represents " families that are not accumulating [ wealth ]			2
these are families that have children who are going to college			2
and they 're saying , ' i ca n't help you			0
i do n't have anything for you			0
' " that 's the case for @entity1 and his wife , @entity105			1
@entity106 , the youngest of their children , was attending @entity109 until last spring			0
he had to leave , partly because his grades were poor , and partly because the @entity111 did n't have the money for him to stay			0
" the financial condition of this family says we ca n't afford you to [ be ] back at @entity109			0
we can not afford that level of tuition			0
it just can not happen , " @entity1 says			1
@entity106 is now in community college , and his grades are better			2
he hopes to return to @entity109 soon			0
" when my blessing comes through , then there will probably be a blessing extended to @entity106 to go back , " @entity1 says			1
" we 're not sure when that will be			0
" fields ' next " blessing " may not be as profitable as his last job			2
a @entity129 says that " underemployment " for blacks was 28.3 percent in may			0
that means more than a quarter of employed blacks are working for less money at jobs beneath their skill or education levels			0
@entity1 says he realizes and accepts that he may not ever work in a job at his skill level ever again			1
every day he goes to the library to surf the job boards and fill out applications			2
" not all of those are in my career discipline , " he says , nodding to the jobs pulled up on a computer screen			0
" it does n't really matter			0
... i 've been out of the picky mode for quite some time			0
" this former vice president has recently applied for positions as an administrative assistant and warehouse clerk			0
one version of his résumé leaves off his vice president title so that employers do n't automatically weed him out as " overqualified			0
" in addition to the online applications , @entity1 has attended more than a dozen job fairs , but he says he leaves every one feeling frustrated			1
" i go despite the results because i never know if the next job fair is going to be the one where that job , the next career will come from			2
it causes me to keep going , " he says			0
in the end , it may be his faith -- or at least his church -- that leads to a job			1
when @entity1 ' influential pastor , the rev. @entity174 , found out he was looking for work after more than a year and a half , the minister asked some of his more connected members to put some feelers out for @entity1			1
that has n't yielded fields a job ... yet			2
but he says he 's still hopeful .			0

@entity1 , 59 , is an african - american with a college degree who has been unemployed for a year and a half .
he is one of many black males unemployed , which statistics show are almost *double* the number of white males .
@entity1 is also looking to his church for not only spiritual *guidance* but help in finding a job , too .
