-- a chemical used in the manufacture of common household products -- such as some food packaging , carpets , paint , and nonstick cookware -- may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease , a new study suggests			1
the chemical , perfluorooctanoic acid ( @entity13 ) , is present in trace amounts in up to 98 % of @entity15			1
previous research has linked pfoa exposure to unhealthy cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart disease , but the potential health hazards posed by the chemical remain largely unknown			1
in the new study , which included a nationally representative sample of adults , those with the highest levels of @entity13 in their blood had double the odds of having a history of heart disease , heart attack , or stroke , compared to adults with the lowest pfoa levels			1
the highest pfoa levels also were associated with 78 % higher odds of peripheral artery disease , a condition related to heart disease in which the arteries in the limbs narrow and harden			1
although these numbers may sound alarming , the researchers say the results should be interpreted with caution			1
because the study looked at the relationship between pfoa and heart disease at a single point in time , it does n't show that pfoa exposure causes -- or even precedes -- heart disease			1
@entity0 : surprising heart attack risks the researchers did factor in numerous health and demographic measures ( such as race , education , obesity , smoking , and cholesterol ) , but they emphasize that unknown factors besides @entity13 may explain some or all of the association seen in the study			1
" what we are finding is that high levels of pfoa and cardiovascular disease coexisted for some reason			2
that is all , " says lead author dr. @entity68 , an epidemiologist at the @entity69 in @entity70			0
" it is possible that we are seeing something that is just a bystander and is there because of confounding associations			0
" the study , which was published this week in the @entity78 , was based on data from the @entity80 , a large government health survey conducted annually			2
@entity0 : 11 things it 's best to buy organic although the study is merely a " red flag " and more research is needed , minimizing exposure to @entity13 still may be prudent in the meantime , says dr. @entity87 , chief of cardiovascular medicine at the @entity89 in @entity90			2
for instance , people whose drinking water may be contaminated by nearby factories that use @entity13 could use bottled water or filtered water , says @entity87 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the study			2
avoiding nonstick cookware and other consumer products that may contain @entity13 is another way for individuals to limit exposure , he adds			0
according to the @entity103 , the trace amounts of @entity13 found in consumer products are generally a remnant of the manufacturing process and do not appear to pose a threat to human health			0
still , the agency is working with several large companies to eliminate pfoa and related chemicals from products and factory emissions by 2015			0
prior studies in humans , animals and petri dishes have suggested several pathways through which @entity13 might affect heart health			0
pfoa exposure has been associated , for instance , with blood - vessel dysfunction , high " bad " cholesterol ( @entity128 ) , low " good " cholesterol ( @entity130 ) , and insulin resistance , all of which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease			0
@entity0 : 10 ways to lower cholesterol even if this preliminary research is borne out , however , it 's important to remember that obesity , smoking , high blood pressure , and other classic risk factors are responsible for an overwhelming majority of heart attacks , says dr. @entity144 , a cardiologist and internist at the @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148			1
" not smoking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle should be part of any kind of prevention program for cardiovascular disease , " @entity87 says			0
" we do n't want to forget the 900 - pound gorilla in the room			0
" @entity157 linked to rise in kids ' cholesterol @entity160 2011			0

@entity163 acid is present in up to 98 % of @entity15
study : those with the highest levels may have an increased risk of stroke or heart attack
researchers say the numbers should be interpreted with caution
