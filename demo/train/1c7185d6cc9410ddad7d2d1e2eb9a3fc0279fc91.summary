his voice became hauntingly familiar as the masked man with a @entity5 accent who appeared repeatedly in brutal beheading videos from @entity7			0
but the identity of " @entity9 " remained a mystery -- until thursday , when two @entity12 officials and two @entity12 congressional sources confirmed it			1
the man , the officials said , is @entity17 , a @entity18 - born londoner			1
the officials , who 've been briefed on the matter , spoke to @entity2 after a @entity22 report first revealed @entity17 's identity			1
@entity17 is believed to have traveled to @entity24 in 2012 , according to the newspaper , and later to have joined @entity7 there			2
even with a name and face for the man behind the mask , uncertainty still swirled thursday			0
@entity32 police and @entity5 officials declined to confirm his identity			1
officials from a @entity32 - based human rights and @entity39 advocacy organization who 've interacted with @entity17 said they could n't be 100 % certain it was him			1
and a key question remained unanswered : what inspired him to join @entity7 ? the answer depends on who you ask			0
some terrorism experts said @entity17 's history shows someone who 'd been on a path toward extremism for years			1
but @entity54 , the @entity32 advocacy group that worked with him , said if he is the man who 's appeared in @entity7 videos , it 's a sign that @entity5 authorities ' tactics pushed him to radicalize			1
@entity17 was born in @entity18 in 1988 and moved to the @entity5 when he was 6 years old , cage said on its website			1
he studied at the @entity63 in @entity32 and graduated in 2009 with a degree in computer programming , the group said			1
@entity17 , according to @entity54 , " hoped that with this degree , he could build a successful career in @entity68 countries , as he was fluent in @entity69 , @entity70 and had a @entity5 accent			2
" did something change to send him on a different path ? according to the @entity22 , friends of @entity17 said they believed his path to radicalization began when he went on a trip to the @entity79 nation of @entity80 in 2009			2
he was supposed to be going on safari there , but was reportedly detained on arrival , held overnight and then deported			0
he was also detained by counterterrorism officials in @entity5 in 2010 , the @entity22 said			2
authorities have n't provided any reasons behind those reported detentions			2
@entity32 police declined to confirm the reported identity			1
" we have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk , " said @entity90			0
@entity98 of the @entity100 's @entity99			1
" we are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation			2
" a @entity5 @entity108 spokeswoman told @entity2 : " we will neither confirm nor deny the current reporting as to the identity of @entity9			1
" there are " striking similarities " between @entity113 and the man known as " @entity9 , " according to @entity115 , cage 's research director			1
@entity115 told reporters thursday that he could n't be 100 % certain that @entity17 is @entity9 because the man 's face is covered in the videos			1
but @entity115 said the man he knew was very different than the merciless figure from @entity7 videos			0
@entity17 was a " polite " and " beautiful young man " who would drop into the @entity54 office with treats to thank the group for helping him			1
@entity17 came to cage in 2009 looking for support when he felt that @entity5 authorities were -- in @entity115 's words -- " harassing " him			1
if @entity17 is indeed @entity9 , @entity115 said , that makes him sad			1
but in some ways , he said , it 's not surprising			2
" it 's hard to imagine the trajectory , but it 's not a trajectory that 's unfamiliar , " he said			2
many @entity39 feel alienated in their society , like @entity17 did , he said			2
" when are we going to finally learn if we treat people as if they 're outsiders ... they will look for belonging elsewhere ? " @entity115 said			0
" our entire national security strategy for the last 13 years has only increased alienation			0
" the @entity22 's report includes emails @entity17 purportedly wrote after @entity5 counterterrorism officials detained him and stopped him from flying to @entity18			1
" i had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started , " he wrote in a june 2010 email to @entity115 , the @entity22 reported			0
but now " i feel like a prisoner , only not in a cage , in @entity32			1
a person imprisoned & controlled by security service men , stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country , @entity18 , " the email said			0
@entity54 points the finger at @entity5 security services , who they say have " systematically engaged in the harassment of young @entity39 , rendering their lives impossible and leaving them with no legal avenue to redress their situation			0
" @entity165 , managing director of the @entity166 , a @entity5 - based counter-extremism think tank , said the advocacy group was pointing the finger in the wrong direction			1
it 's clear @entity17 had been radicalized before 2010 , he said			1
and , according to @entity165 , intelligence agencies who stopped @entity17 traveling to @entity80 believed there was evidence that he intended to join the extremist group @entity177 in @entity178			1
@entity165 added that it was " very upsetting that an organization like cage would spin this in the way that they 've done , " by blaming intelligence agencies			0
former @entity184 counterterrorism analyst @entity183 told @entity2 that blaming radicalization on alienation was oversimplifying @entity17 's story			1
" we 're only seeing half of this story , " he said			0
" the government does n't spend the resources and take the risk , the legal risk of pulling somebody aside , preventing them from traveling , searching through their luggage , just because somebody looks funny			0
there is something else going on here in terms of whatever triggered the government to undertake this investigation that we 're missing here			0
" the masked , black - clad figure believed to be @entity9 appeared to be the @entity7 militant shown in a video last month demanding a $ 200 million ransom to spare the lives of two @entity214 journalists			1
a similar figure appeared in at least five previous hostage videos			0
@entity12 and @entity5 officials have previously said they believed they knew who the man was , but were n't disclosing the information publicly			0
that could be because @entity224 intelligence agencies believed they had more to gain from keeping quiet , @entity221 , a former @entity184 officer , told @entity2 last month			0
" they can put pressure on his family , put pressure on his friends , " he told @entity2			0
" maybe they have a line to him			0
maybe they know who his cousins are who are going to @entity24 who can identify him			0
however , if you publicly tell everybody who he is , his real identity , then maybe he 'll go to ground and he 'll disappear			0
" the man 's reported background gives some clues as to why he might have been recruited , said @entity245 , director of international security at the @entity247			2
" we know that @entity7 recruits a lot of @entity224 who are skilled in new media , understanding of the @entity253 , because they use that as their platform as an oxygen of publicity , " he said			0
but by not revealing his name for operational reasons , one expert said , officials may have created another problem			0
" it created more speculation in the media , " he said			0
" in some ways , the @entity264 of @entity9 gave this individual a form of notorious celebrity			2
" opinion : why ' @entity9 ' is so worrying @entity2 's @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			2
