for attendees who do have those coveted badges , gaming also has been incorporated into convention panels			0
" @entity125 " creators @entity123 and @entity124 are in town to talk about their collaboration with developer @entity128 on the role - playing game " @entity125 : the @entity131			1
" and fans will learn what 's next for the groundbreaking hit " @entity135 " at a panel with creators and actors from the hit tv show plus game developers who have launched a massively multiplayer online ( @entity143 ) action game set in the same universe			1
here are five promising games from @entity4			1
" @entity147 : @entity148 " ( @entity104 ; october 25 ; @entity81 , @entity149 , pc , @entity67 ) with @entity152 taking over this popular franchise , gamers will take control of the @entity155 very early on in the @entity147 mythology			1
this prequel , which is set on christmas eve in a snow - swept @entity159 , has the @entity157 putting a hit on @entity147			2
gamers must use all of @entity147 's resources as they contend with eight criminal masterminds , including the @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and the @entity167 , along with their assorted thugs			0
this @entity147 is aggressive and athletic , and he has a few new toys like the @entity171 and the remote claw , which allows him to target multiple enemies in one swoop			0
players will also explore new areas from the comic book mythology like @entity178 , @entity179 and the city 's docks			0
much like @entity185 's films , the " @entity183 " franchise has excelled at bringing a fresh take to the @entity147 , and this third game is shaping up as another crossover hit			2
" @entity189 " ( @entity190 ; november ; @entity35 ) it would n't be comic - con without zombies			2
this latest game from @entity194 may be set 10 years after the events of " @entity196 , " but everything about this next - generation horror game is different -- beginning with the horror			1
the humorous tone of previous iterations is taking a back seat to real scares in this open world game			1
these zombies are frightening and a lot tougher to deal with			0
the city of @entity208 offers plenty of challenges ( it 's so large , you can actually fit the first two game worlds inside it ) , since it 's been overrun by the undead			2
it 's a huge seamless playground that 's completely destructible			0
vehicles , including a hearse , are at your disposal as transportation and another weapon against zombies			0
players take control of mechanic @entity225 , who has the ability to build some very cool customized weapons			0
the game also utilizes @entity230 voice , allowing players to distract zombies with voice commands			2
and the @entity234 opens up exclusive missions and second - screen functionality for what looks like a bloody good time			2
share your mini-interviews from @entity4 " @entity28 : @entity29 " ( @entity241 ; 2014 ; @entity30 , pc ) @entity20 has embraced independent developers with its @entity30 console and invited them onstage during its @entity246 news conference last month			1
one of those featured games comes from the @entity248 - based @entity241 , and it 's unlike any next - generation game out there			1
players take control of an orange octopus somehow passing as a human by wearing a blue suit			0
the challenge is in accomplishing mundane tasks like shopping at a grocery store or cooking on a grill while controlling your tentacles to walk and pick things up			0
those suction cups quickly get in the way , however			0
the objective is to remain unnoticed by the humans ( who do n't seem to mind an octopus until he starts flinging plates across the room by accident )			0
the challenges get progressively more difficult , as players must navigate a wedding ceremony without tripping on banana peels or knocking over the priceless vases that line the aisle			0
this game offers plenty to laugh at and requires a lot of skill to complete			2
" @entity282 : @entity40 " ( @entity64 / @entity283 ; september 3 ; @entity242 ) in this real - time strategy game , players must assume control of a powerful ruler from the earliest days of the @entity288 with the goal of conquering the world			1
this sequel to the popular pc game returns us to the rich history of ancient @entity40 and incorporates everything from epic battles featuring hundreds of soldiers , horses , catapults and @entity301 war elephants to the political intrigue of diplomacy and nation - building			1
players can zoom in to the battles as soldiers slice and dice their way through enemy lines			0
the game also allows naval battles , meaning warships can destroy enemy vessels , and sailors can board and fight the survivors			2
even novices can command huge battlefields , moving from skirmish to skirmish with the click of a mouse			0
if you have a higher - end @entity242 , the developers have brought every detail , from the weapons to the landscapes , to life in high - definition glory			1
history has never been so much fun			0
" @entity329 " ( @entity53 ; november 19 ; @entity81 , @entity149 , pc , @entity67 , @entity35 , @entity30 ) @entity53 is introducing a massive open - world game that recreates the city of @entity248 and allows players to control every camera , traffic light and @entity337 train within it			1
playing as @entity339 , a hacker with a smartphone that connects to @entity248 's central operation system , players can access every element of the city 's infrastructure and learn about every citizen who surrounds them			2
all of this power creates superhero - like capabilities through technology			0
players must decide how to use this power and gauge their own morality level by choosing to help crime victims or aid the bad guys			0
every action will have repercussions , as the police and even citizens will get involved			0
the game utilizes @entity234 , allowing a second player to either help or hinder @entity339 as he explores this world .			1
