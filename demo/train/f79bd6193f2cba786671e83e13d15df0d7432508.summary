@entity0 , @entity1 -- they come from all walks of life			0
one teenage girl cuts her thighs after piano lessons to avoid the crushing pressure for perfection			0
she sees a therapist twice a week , but she never gets better			2
another young woman makes dangerous cuts to her arms and wrists when she is anxious			0
she is on her fourth foster placement because no one can handle her behavior			0
another burns her fingers with a cigarette lighter when she hears her parents fight			0
she 's been hospitalized twice in the past year			2
stories such as these are heard daily by those of us who study and treat self - injury -- that is , any activity resulting in intentional bodily damage to oneself			1
it is a syndrome found across cultures and socioeconomic classes ( although it tends to be a bit more common among the more well - off ) , and it appears to be on the rise			2
though cutting the skin with sharp objects is the most common method used , especially by girls , other means of self - injury including head banging , overdosing , burning , hanging , drowning and shooting			1
given its potential for death and serious injury , this phenomenon has received increasing media attention , with a number of movies , such as " secretary " in 2002 , portraying the phenomenon			2
from my perspective , this is an urgent public health issue , yet funding for research and treatment lags well behind funding for other behavioral disorders , such as autism			2
self - injury is troubling for several reasons			1
first of all , almost 400,000 adolescents and young adults were treated medically for self - inflicted injuries in 2006 , the most recent year for which these injuries were counted			2
one recent study revealed that the number of children and adolescents in the @entity75 who were hospitalized for depression , which is sometimes accompanied by self - injury among youth , increased by 27 percent between 1997 and 2007			1
second , self - injury is associated with crippling psychiatric distress			1
girls who engage in such behaviors score lower than their peers on almost all measures of positive psychological adjustment , such as sociability , and higher than their peers on almost all measures of negative psychological adjustment , such as depression and delinquency			2
third , adolescent self - injury is linked to adult borderline personality disorder -- a chronic and difficult to treat mental health condition characterized by impulsive behaviors , difficulties self - regulating emotions , mood instability and high rates of suicide			1
finally , self - injury is the single best predictor of suicide			1
intentional self - injurers are about 75 times more likely to kill themselves than others in the population , an especially alarming statistic			2
scientists are not sure why rates of self - injury appear to be on the rise , or how to stop the trend			1
when teens who self - injure are asked why they do it , most say the behaviors help them regulate overwhelming negative emotions , including anger , sadness and rejection			1
this emotion - regulating function may occur because injuries trigger the release of endogenous opioids , chemicals produced by the body that relieve pain			0
over repeated episodes of self - harm , the endogenous opioid system may become more efficient at reducing physical and psychological pain			0
recent studies conducted at high schools and universities reveal that almost 20 percent of individuals self - injure at least once , and about 11 percent self - injure repeatedly			1
given how common the behavior is -- and the alarmingly high risk of eventual suicide -- one might expect self - injury to be a major public health priority			1
one might also expect considerable investment into basic science aimed at understanding the brain mechanisms involved and treatment - outcome research aimed at developing effective interventions			2
unfortunately , this has not been the case			0
@entity148 is known about the brain mechanisms of self - injury , particularly in adolescence , and traditional approaches to treatment usually involve inpatient hospitalization , which is more cost - effective than individual care			1
however , when treated in groups , as is often the case in hospitalization , self - injuring girls often become worse , not better , an effect known as contagion			0
( note that this can also occur through access to web sites and web postings in which self - injurers share strategies			0
) nevertheless , there has been some progress toward understanding and treating adolescent self - injury			1
on the basic research side , @entity170 , a graduate student in my lab , is conducting a study in which the brains of adolescent girls who engage in self - injury are imaged as they cope with negative emotions			1
on the treatment side , dr. @entity180 's @entity179 at the @entity1 is signs of hope			0
the therapy is a variant of cognitive therapy and an effective treatment for adults with borderline personality disorder			0
it has been adapted to adolescent patients with encouraging results			0
despite these positive developments , a much greater investment is needed			0
for fiscal year 2010 , the @entity195 -- far and away the primary source of funding for health research in the world -- projects spending $ 41 million on suicide and suicide prevention ( @entity195 does not report specific funding figures for self - injury )			1
in contrast , @entity195 expenditures for autism are expected to be $ 141 million in 2010			0
corrected for the higher prevalence rate of suicide , this translates into a six-fold greater investment per person with autism			0
indeed , across the past five years , @entity195 has spent more than $ 700 million on autism research , with impressive results in terms of treatment effectiveness and our understanding of the genetic and neural underpinnings of the disorder			0
given the urgency of preventing suicide among our youth , a similar investment is needed in self - injury research .			1

@entity230 says he sees rise in youth self - injury , such as cutting , burning
syndrome crosses culture , class ; it 's linked to suicide , yet research funding lags , he says
kids say they self - injure to help deal with negative emotions , he says , but studies are *sparse*
@entity230 : @entity75 must boost funding for study of self - injury
