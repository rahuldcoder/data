@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 state rep. @entity3 never bought the official version of what happened 15 years ago monday at the @entity6			1
even though authorities prosecuted a small group of extremists , whose homemade bomb killed 168 people , @entity3 claimed that there was a government conspiracy to hide the truth			1
he said at a 1998 news conference , " it 's obvious that there 's more to this case than what some in the government want you to know			2
" today , his distrust of the federal government is as deep as ever			1
@entity3 stands for many of the issues that attract @entity27 protesters to a rally on the @entity30 steps : less government , lower taxes and more liberty			1
" i was talking about these issues before the @entity27 movement came into existence , " he said			1
using the rhetoric of colonial revolutionaries defying the @entity39 monarch , @entity3 says today 's federal government is " dictatorial , " on its way to becoming " more of a tyranny			1
" @entity3 's outspoken views once cost him his job			1
a retired @entity46 agent , @entity45 , had worked in the @entity6 building , knew many of the victims and was outraged over @entity3 's claim that federal agents knew of the bomb plot and did not stop it			1
" i could n't believe that at all , " @entity54 said			0
" having served with these people , i know there 's no way somebody would have covered it up			0
" @entity54 beat @entity3 in the 1998 @entity60 primary and went on to serve four consecutive terms in the state legislature before stepping down			2
by then , the raw memories of domestic terrorism on april 19 , 1995 , had been eclipsed by foreign terrorists on september 11 , 2001			0
the time was right for @entity3 to make a comeback			2
" when i ran in 2006 , the @entity0 bombing was not on the radar screen , " he said			0
" i have moved past it			0
" @entity3 's former political nemesis also supports many of today 's @entity27 positions			1
" i believe the @entity74 people are fed up with the system and the robbery of our personal rights and privileges , " @entity54 said			0
but he worries that a legitimate political debate will have an unintended consequence			0
" my concerns are that there are going to be some radicals who are going to think it 's ok to do things that are illegal , like killing people , " @entity54 said , " because they think it 's going to be approved by the @entity27 movement or other people who are upset with the government			1
" it 's just the opposite , @entity3 said			2
" if [ the @entity27 movement ] does anything , it 's an avenue that people need to have so they can express themselves to the government " without violence			1
@entity3 warns that if there 's another domestic terrorist attack like the one on the @entity6 , it will be the fault of the federal government			1
" history tells us that it 's government becoming too heavy - handed , going out of its proper role , is what fuels extremism , " @entity3 said			1
" people get their buttons pushed , to put it one way			0
they get their buttons pushed , and some people will take violent actions			0
" @entity3 's current agenda is inspired by the 10th amendment to the @entity119 , which limits federal authority over the 50 states and over individual citizens			1
he legislative proposals include @entity124 , which would fund roads and bridges , not by taxing @entity127 or selling bonds but by having state - chartered banks create their own money			0
another proposal , @entity124 2810 , the @entity131 , would have @entity1 withhold federal excise taxes from @entity134 if the state legislature determines that the @entity74 government has violated the @entity119			2
" i understand that this legislation is different than your typical legislation , " @entity3 said			2
an editorial in @entity141 called the bills " a waste of time " and sympathized with residents of @entity144 " if they 're having second thoughts " about re-electing @entity3			2
is key once again out of step with his constituents ? he says no. " i was elected to look out for their rights			0
that includes life , liberty and property			0
" but time is running out for @entity3			2
assuming he is re-elected in 2010 , he will become the victim of a populist anti-government movement from the 1990s : term limits			0
under @entity1 law , legislators are limited to 12 years			0
even those who rail against the government .			0

many of issues rep. @entity3 stands for attract *members* of the @entity27
@entity3 has mistrusted government since 1995 attack on @entity6
key : today 's federal government is " dictatorial , " on way to becoming " tyranny "
