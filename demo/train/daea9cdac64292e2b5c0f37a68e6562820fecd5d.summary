-- actress @entity1 is an ambassador for @entity2 , an international alliance of 15 organizations striving to find lasting solutions to poverty and injustice			1
the group works directly with communities in 98 countries			1
as part of her efforts , @entity12 advocates for vulnerable women around the world			1
she recently spoke with @entity0 's @entity17 about the need to help people improve their lives			2
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity0 : what inspired you to get involved with @entity2 ? @entity1 : @entity2 is unique in helping people become independent			1
one of the reasons i got involved was that after the tsunami , i remember all of the fishermen whose entire lives had gotten washed away in @entity34			0
i thought , " how are they ever going to get their livelihoods back ? " @entity2 was committed to staying there until those fishermen got their own livelihoods back together so that they could be self - sufficient			1
. @entity0 : you are specifically interested in helping women receive job training and education			2
why is that important to you ? @entity12 : a lot of times , these women have been left alone or their husbands have died of @entity49 or different things			1
i was interested in helping women who may live in a world where they were n't trained to do anything and they were n't afforded an education			2
@entity2 will go into these communities and try to help out			1
it might be raising chickens , it might be sewing beaded necklaces ; they 're helping the women empower themselves			1
and , especially for women , that 's a huge , huge life - changing thing to be able to be self - sufficient			2
the women can then support their children , and usually the women send their children to school and it changes the next generation			2
@entity0 : what is your role as an ambassador ? @entity12 : the way i perceive my role as an ambassador -- which i think is personal for everyone -- is that i travel to places that i 'm interested in , where there 's a story or a particular situation with women usually , and i just talk to people and i 'm a witness to their story			1
i come back and try to tell their stories			0
just going is such an inspiration for me that i would do it ( if ) no one asked me at all			0
but it 's wonderful for me to be able to talk about it to other people , because i think sometimes we 're not aware of how other people are living			0
@entity0 : what is a hero to you ? @entity12 : i think right now our world is somewhat chaotic			1
there 's a lot to be upset about and a lot to complain about , and the heroes are the people who are getting up and doing something about it			0
that 's what i love about the @entity108 program : that it 's people all over the world who may just be on their own trying to fix something			0
and i think that 's great			0
it 's great to be able to support people who are involved in maybe a small - scale way , trying to make the world better			0
i think there are so many people trying so hard to change things , and the news just does n't get to cover them all			0
so it 's nice that @entity108 does cover it .			0
