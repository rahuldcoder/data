-- it turns out that consumers like the idea of watching tv shows with no other ads. and , surprise , the television networks are less than thrilled			0
on friday , news was continuing to emerge about a flurry of lawsuits between @entity10 , which last week released a tool to let its dvr customers do exactly that , and the major television networks			1
it 's a battle over a new technology tool			2
but , in some ways , it 's a microcosm of the fight for the future of television and how we watch it			0
" with @entity10 's aggressive move to please the end customer rather than advertisers , it 's clear that in the fight for tv revenue the gloves have finally come off , " @entity23 , an analyst for @entity24 , told @entity25			1
" the fact that @entity10 would be willing to anger some of its most important content partners just goes to show how desperate these times we live in really are			1
" two weeks ago , @entity10 rolled out @entity37 , a feature for its @entity39 that lets users who subscribe automatically skip ads while watching recorded shows			1
it did n't take long for the lawsuits to start flying back and forth			0
@entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 all filed suit in federal court on thursday , and @entity10 fired back with a claim of its own against the networks			1
the scuffle is the latest in a series of fights between traditional entertainment providers and web - based delivery systems that can be traced back to @entity56 vs. @entity57 and beyond			0
whether it 's illegal downloads ( the target of the failed @entity61 in @entity62 ) or dvr systems that let users quickly and easily zoom past advertising , the new - media landscape offers a host of hurdles that have left some entertainers and , by extension , entertainment companies , struggling to adapt			2
it 's an argument that will sound familiar to those who have followed those fights			0
the tv networks are saying that @entity39 has , in effect , violated their copyrights by stripping away the traditional way they make money			0
" how does @entity80 expect me to produce ' csi ' without ads ? " @entity46 chief executive @entity84 said this week , referring to @entity10 's ceo			1
for their part , @entity10 argues that people have been skipping tv ads , in one way or another , since the invention of television			1
viewers have muted ads for decades , and the @entity39 's fast - forward function only hastened the process			2
" we are giving them a feature they want and that gives them more control , " said @entity98 , @entity10 senior vice president of programming , in a statement			1
@entity107 analyst @entity106 said the tool might not make that much difference for the typical tv watcher , though			2
@entity112 's commercial - skipping powers only kick in at 1 a.m. the day after the original program airs			1
he says that means the overwhelming majority of @entity39 viewers will watch when ads are still intact			2
an @entity120 article that highlighted @entity106 's comments also noted that , according to @entity122 , 82 % of broadcast tv viewing and 90 % of cable viewing still takes place the day a show airs			0
as @entity128 noted , this is n't the only front on which the entertainment vs. tech war is being waged			0
on wednesday , several local @entity133 stations , including the local @entity44 , @entity134 and @entity136 channels , filed suit against a new technology called @entity139			1
@entity139 would allow consumers to watch and record broadcast tv online by hooking up a small antenna to an internet connection			0
the broadcasters are seeking an injunction against @entity139 , claiming the company is allowing consumers to bypass cable retransmission fees .			0

a new @entity10 tool would let viewers skip commercials
the company rolled out the dvr tool , @entity112 , earlier this month
@entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 have filed suit , saying it violates copyright
@entity10 says viewers have always skipped commercials in some way
