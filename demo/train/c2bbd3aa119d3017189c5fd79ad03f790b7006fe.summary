@entity0 , @entity1 -- a feisty @entity3 attacked her @entity5 opponent but also stumbled in wednesday 's debate with @entity7 in their election battle for @entity1 's @entity11 seat held for nearly four decades by vice president @entity12			1
the highly anticipated showdown between two candidates considered surprise contenders featured @entity3 displaying her conservative credentials that gained @entity17 backing while @entity7 , put on the defensive at times , generally backed @entity5 policies favored by president @entity21			1
@entity3 's primary victory over a veteran mainstream @entity24 candidate last month shook up the @entity24 establishment , with party strategist @entity26 even questioning her qualifications			1
now trailing badly according to the latest polls , she appeared nervous at the start but quickly went on the attack , accusing @entity7 of raising taxes and offering a " rubber stamp " to @entity21 administration policies if elected			1
" my opponent wants to go to @entity35 and rubber - stamp the spending bills " that she said are hurting the nation and @entity1			0
later , @entity3 said , a vote for @entity7 would cost the average @entity1 $ 10,000 " instantly " in tax hikes and energy reform costs			1
at other times , her attacks were less precise and drew scorn from @entity7 , such as when she said the influence of a @entity51 college professor on @entity7 ' political beliefs should " send chills up the spine of every @entity1 voter			1
" " if it were accurate , if it were true , i 'd agree , " @entity7 responded			1
" it 's not accurate and it 's not true			0
" he emphasized his experience as @entity59 executive but also attacked @entity3 , calling some of her positions extreme and accusing her of lying about his record in campaign messaging			1
" most of them are untrue , " @entity7 said of claims about him on her campaign website			1
" some of them are just flat - out lies , some of them are mischaracterizations , some of them are just factually untrue			0
" both candidates framed the election as a clear choice for voters , and their stance on issues showed that			2
@entity80 : tell us how you think the candidates did @entity7 said he supports abortion rights and embryonic stem cell research while opposing the ban on openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service , and he backed most @entity21 administration policies , with a few refinements			1
for example , he said @entity93 - era tax cuts should be extended to the vast majority of the county but questioned @entity21 's plan to limit the extension to those families making up to $ 250,000 a year			0
he also said the health care reform law needed some adjustments			0
@entity3 backed @entity24 positions such as calling for tax cuts and spending cuts to balance the budget , and she repeatedly said tough social issues such as abortion rights and teaching creation theory in public schools should be state or local issues instead of federal decisions			1
when pressed on a comment from more than decade ago when she questioned evolution theory , she responded : " what i believe is irrelevant			0
what i will support in @entity35 , is the ability of the local school system to decide what is taught in their classrooms			0
" in one testy exchange , @entity3 referred to @entity21 administration policies creating what she called " a culture of dependency " by expanding the number of people getting food stamps			1
@entity7 immediately tried to portray her as insensitive saying : " to simply denounce people as being dependent because they 're applying for and receiving food stamps in the worst recession in modern times is frankly slandering people who are in incredibly difficult times			1
" @entity3 interrupted , saying , " that 's not fair			2
that 's not fair of you to say that because that 's not at all what i 'm doing , " and then counter-attacking by declaring : " i 'm not the person who would cut the tax benefits of disabled and low - income citizens as you did as county executive			0
" the most serious problem for either candidate came when @entity3 was asked to cite any specific recent @entity150 rulings that she opposed			2
" oh gosh , give me a specific one , " she said , and when told the question required her come up with cases , @entity3 responded , " i 'm sorry , " and promised to put the information up later on her website			2
@entity7 quickly referred to the @entity158 ruling in january in which the court lifted some limits on corporate contributions to campaign spending			2
the debate produced a few humorous moments , such as when @entity7 said @entity3 's well - publicized statements from a decade earlier that she dabbled in witchcraft and questioned evolution theory were distractions instead of a substantive campaign issue			1
" you 're just jealous that you were n't on ' @entity173 ' , " @entity3 said , referring to the comedy show 's satirical skit about her			2
" i 'm dying to see who 's going to play me , " @entity7 responded with a smile			2
@entity3 scored a major upset last month when she defeated rep. @entity177 to win @entity1 's @entity179 nomination			2
she had support from the @entity181 , a major endorsement from former @entity184 gov. @entity183 , as well as the strong anti-establishment and anti-incumbent feelings among voters this year in topping @entity188 , a moderate @entity24 who served nine terms in the @entity191 and eight years as governor before that			0
however , her victory made a race considered relatively safe for @entity24 based on the expected nomination of the popular @entity177 into one in which the little - known @entity7 suddenly became the favorite , due to @entity3 's inexperience and questions about her past			1
since @entity3 's primary victory , she has had to deal with controversial and colorful comments she made about a decade ago when she was a spokeswoman for conservative causes			1
her first campaign commercial began with @entity3 declaring , " i am not a witch " in response to her statement years ago on the program " @entity211 " that she " dabbled in witchcraft			2
" she acknowledged in an interview with @entity2 that the resurfaced clips have forced her to reinvent herself in the final weeks of the campaign			2
" i have n't been embarrassed			0
and i 'm not saying that i 'm proud , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity217 last week			1
" i 've matured in my faith			0
i 've matured in my policies			0
today you have a forty - something woman running for office , not a 20 - year - old			0
so that 's a big difference			0
" the debate at the @entity226 in @entity0 was co-moderated by @entity2 's @entity227 and by longtime @entity1 news anchor @entity228 of @entity229			1
results of a @entity2 / @entity232 survey released wednesday showed @entity7 with a 19 - point lead over @entity3			1
however , @entity3 enjoys a lead in campaign cash , which is one reason both president @entity21 and @entity12 are coming to @entity1 on friday to help @entity7 raise money			1
@entity3 , 41 , ran unsuccessfully for @entity11 twice before , in 2006 and 2008			2
since winning the primary , she 's had to deal with controversies involving unpaid income taxes and allegations of misusing campaign donations , as well as attacks from @entity5 and some @entity24 , including @entity26 , on her qualifications			0
@entity7 , the 47 - year - old executive of @entity59 , the state 's most populous county , faced no serious opposition in the @entity5 primary			1
while he is running his first statewide campaign , @entity7 is neither a political novice nor a party outsider			0
in 1988 , @entity7 served as a policy researcher for the failed @entity11 campaign of then - lt. gov. @entity253			0
he went on to earn a degree from @entity255 , as well as a master 's in ethics from @entity258			0
the winner in november will fill out the remaining four years of @entity12 's final term in the @entity11			0
@entity12 stepped down from his seat after his election in november 2008 as vice president			0
former @entity12 aide @entity264 was named as an interim replacement , and did not seek a full term			0
@entity2 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity217 , and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
