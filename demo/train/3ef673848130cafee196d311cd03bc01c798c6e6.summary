when the love child of the doughnut and the croissant was created by the @entity4 in @entity5 , fans queued for hours to sample the tasty hybrid snack			1
with only 300 cronuts made each day sold at $ 5 a pop , they are so coveted that they can go for up to $ 40 on the pastry black market			1
even supermodel @entity11 had to wait weeks to try one			0
though the cronut has gained worldwide attention on social media since its debut in may , few in the @entity17 have had the chance to taste the unique pastry -- until now			1
" it just went viral because it 's new , " @entity4 told @entity20 '			2
" it 's fun ; it 's unusual ; it 's good			0
" one @entity17 bakery described it as the most exciting pastry launch since the sausage roll			1
but although they have proved extremely popular with @entity17 customers , the intense enthusiasm for cronuts in @entity5 is unlikely to be replicated in @entity32			1
" cronuts are called " @entity34 " in this country and you can buy them in [ the supermarket @entity44			0
we 've had them for decades , " wrote @entity38 , the owner of @entity32 's @entity40 steakhouse , in an email to his business partner			0
@entity46 , co-owner of the @entity48 and @entity49 cafe in @entity32 says @entity17 cronut - eaters are attempting to master the treat with a knife and fork			1
" i think using your hands is the best way , " he says			0
back across the pond , a young woman in the queue outside the @entity4 declared the cronut a typically @entity60 invention			2
" a croissant is a great pastry in the morning ; a doughnut is a great pastry in the morning			2
really to combine the two is representative of the @entity60 way			0
it 's really efficient and delicious and fattening and great			0
" @entity4 has copyrighted the term " cronut , " prompting bakeries to come up with alternative names like " doissant " , " croissant - doughnut " and " doughssant "			1
the much - loved @entity17 bakery chain @entity76 launched the @entity77 in september			1
" there 's nothing unique about it , " says @entity46			0
" it 's just a simple thing that 's really taken off			0
" now bakeries in the @entity17 are desperate to create their own viral dessert -- anybody fancy a waggle ( waffle meets bagel ) ? or a crookie ( croissant meets cookie ) ? how about a townie ( tartlet meets brownie ) ? whatever your preference , it looks like this particular trend will be with us for a while .			2

the cronut - half croissant , half doughnut - has *finally* arrived in @entity17 bakeries
the pastry was created by @entity104 chef @entity4 for his bakery in @entity5
@entity107 can sell for up to $ 40 on the pastry black market in @entity5
