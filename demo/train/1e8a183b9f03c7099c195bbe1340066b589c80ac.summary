-- bankers get a bad press			0
if they are not in news studios trying to defend their annual bonus being more than most people earn in a lifetime , they are attempting to brush off the latest multi-million pound fine they received for ripping off the public			0
not so in the latest edition of the @entity12			0
representatives from the banking sector talk enthusiastically about how they 've reformed their risky business practices and raised billions to fight against poverty and climate change			0
they herald the introduction of a " @entity24 " tax , where speculators pay around a 0.1 % tax on their financial transactions , as a " triumph			2
" ok , so it may not strictly be real life			0
the news anchor is played by " @entity29 " star @entity30 , he quizzes characters played by some of @entity34 's biggest stars -- @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 who says the tax was " a profoundly important moment -- it 's been good for business and it 's brought billions for jobs in @entity34			1
" yet fiction is not so far away from reality			0
eleven @entity34 countries , including @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 are signed up to a @entity50 which could raise up to 30 billion pounds annually and be implemented as early as next year			1
it is the best chance we have of ensuring those responsible for the crisis pay their fair share to put things right			2
unfortunately the @entity57 is refusing to join in , even attempting to block the proposal with a groundless legal challenge in the @entity60			0
as @entity35 's character demonstrates masterfully as he squirms out of questions over how the money could help stop cuts to public services , it means the @entity57 will also lose out on the benefits			1
@entity35 has been involved with the " @entity24 " tax campaign since its inception in 2010			1
he came with us to see first - hand the impact of the financial crisis only a few miles away from its epicenter in the @entity74			1
a food bank in the @entity77 borough of @entity78 , where emergency food parcels are given out to those in the most dire need , had seen numbers increase 50 % in a year			0
there are now over 350 @entity85 food banks across the @entity57 , at one point opening at the rate of one a week , as people struggle to make ends meet in a perfect storm of public service cuts and decreasing standards of living			0
yet the devastation wreaked by the crisis rippled out far beyond national borders			1
@entity97 estimates it left a $ 65 billion dollar hole in the budgets of the world 's poorest countries -- the people least responsible for the crisis are paying the heaviest price			1
meanwhile back in the financial sectors of @entity77 and @entity107 , bankers were cushioned from impacts of their own actions -- public money bailed them out and continues to subsidize them today			2
but it 's not just about ensuring banks give something back , it 's about refocusing our economy away from the fool 's gold of financial sector riches			1
financial products such as derivatives can be useful for the economy -- they allow a haulage company , for example , to buy a petroleum future , meaning their costs are predictable over time			2
but all sense of proportion has been lost , the market in derivatives is now a mind - boggling 70 times the size of global gdp			0
this frenetic swarm of speculative trades may earn a small cabal of the super-rich ever more money , but it brings with it huge risks and when things go wrong , as they did so spectacularly five years , ago billions can be wiped from the real economy			0
the low rate of the tax would help curb these speculative trades whilst avoiding impacting on people 's pensions and savings			2
as the film 's director @entity150 , best known for directing the final four films in the @entity153 , said : " i agreed to direct the film because the " @entity24 " tax is a simple yet brilliant idea			1
we need to learn the lessons of the financial crisis and ensure that banks and hedge funds work in the interests of society not the other way around			1
" he 's not wrong			0
as @entity46 and @entity47 are due to make an announcement on the tax and countries will agree the details in coming weeks			1
let 's hope they agree the best possible tax that raises the most money -- it will help create a financial sector we can all be proud of			2
