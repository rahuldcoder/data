situated where the @entity1 meets the @entity3 , @entity0 had the look and feel of a tropical paradise -- replete with surf camps , resorts and pristine white beaches			1
its location on @entity14 's southeastern tip , in many ways , had been @entity0 's greatest blessing			2
and now ? it could be seen as its greatest curse			0
when @entity19 came ashore early friday -- bringing sustained winds of 315 kph ( 195 mph ) and gusts as strong as 380 kph ( 235 mph ) -- it did so in @entity0			1
buildings collapsed , palm trees snapped , shelters ceased to be			0
and with devastation came desperate needs for , as one @entity0 put it , " food , tents , everything			2
" as he noted : " everything is gone			0
" @entity0 was cut off from outside communication and many basic necessities until recently , when a c - 130 military cargo plane flew over the ravaged area and landed at its small airport			1
the aircraft 's cargo bay was packed with supplies and @entity1 troops			2
once there , where should they start to help ? that 's hard to say , admits @entity0 mayor @entity46 , given the scale of what 's happened			1
almost all of his community 's 50,000 people are now homeless , thanks to @entity53			1
" if you want to look at our municipality , " @entity46 said , " it 's total damage ; 100 % damage			1
" the troops do n't waste any time , quickly unloading drinking water and bags of rice , as residents watch from a safe distance			2
some troops stay to participate in search - and - rescue operations in a place where the death toll is still far from settled			0
within 20 minutes , the @entity70 is back buzzing again			0
its new load includes some people hurt by the storm , some with spinal injuries			0
other more able - bodied people have found seats , hoping to get far from the misery that is likely to forever be associated with a place that many had considered paradise .			0

@entity19 came ashore in @entity0 in the eastern @entity1
days later , the community is *largely* cut off and in need of basic necessities
" it 's total damage , 100 % damage , " community 's mayor says
