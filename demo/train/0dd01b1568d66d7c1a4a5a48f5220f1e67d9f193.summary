they 're a relatively small group of parents in a big country			1
but their decision not to vaccinate their children can have a profound impact on public health			1
opponents of vaccines against diseases like measles are simply on the " wrong side , " @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity7 says			2
just how many people are we talking about , and what do we know about them as a group ? here 's a look at some key numbers			0
according to the @entity20 , in the @entity19 : 95 % of children in kindergarten have had vaccines for preventable diseases , including two doses of the measles , mumps , and rubella ( @entity30 ) vaccine			2
but that figure is not spread evenly across the country			0
82 % of children in @entity34 have had the two - dose mmr vaccine that doctors say is necessary			1
in @entity38 , virtually all children in kindergarten ( 99.7 % ) are vaccinated			1
26 states have not reported meeting a government target of 95 % coverage for @entity30			1
the differences stem from varying laws over when exemptions are allowed			0
the @entity46 reports : 48 states and the @entity48 allow religious exemptions from vaccines 20 states allow philosophical exemptions			2
even within states that have high exemption rates , " vaccination exemptions have been shown to cluster geographically , so vaccine - preventable disease outbreaks can still occur where unvaccinated persons cluster in schools and communities , " the @entity20 says			1
because of health complications , some children should not be vaccinated , doctors say			2
these children are also one of the biggest reasons vaccination is so important			1
those unvaccinated can carry the disease and infect vulnerable children			1
families with medical exemptions make up a small portion of those who do n't vaccinate			0
the @entity20 reports : in @entity76 , there were about 1,000 medical exemptions in the 2013 - 2014 school year , and more than 17,000 philosophical exemptions			0
@entity79 had less than 800 medical exemptions and about 4,000 religious exemptions			0
@entity79 does not allow philosophical exemptions			0
@entity38 and @entity83 do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions , and they reported only about 50 medical exemptions combined			1
( see a full state - by - state breakdown here			0
) why do some parents opt out ? they 're more likely to have vaccine safety concerns and to " perceive fewer benefits associated with vaccines , " a study found -- despite the scientific evidence and debunking of a study that suggested vaccines could trigger autism			1
most of these parents do believe vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children			1
but many also believe their children could suffer from the vaccines themselves			2
the study was published by @entity101 , the official journal of the @entity103 , in 2011			0
it found that among parents who delay and refuse vaccines : 70 % say they believe the vaccines are necessary to protect the health of their children ( compared with 96 % of parents who vaccinate ) 63 % say they fear their children could have serious side effects ( compared with 31 % of parents who vaccinate )			1
57 % say they have concerns about autism			2
78 % say they believe children get too many shots			1
there 's also more mistrust of the medical community among those who do n't vaccinate			0
while 95 % of parents who vaccinate said medical professionals in charge of vaccinations have their children 's best interest at heart , 77 % of parents who delayed and refused vaccines agreed			1
the @entity101 study also found that families of unvaccinated kids are more likely to be : wealthier on average , with annual incomes more than four times the poverty level non-hispanic white married couples in @entity140 - speaking households educated , with college degrees , and covered by private health insurance			1
in the medical community , conversations are underway about how to reach out to these parents			2
" there 's not much we can do about the small core of people who oppose vaccines based on ideology , " @entity146 , a brain injury doctor in @entity148 , wrote in a @entity0 column			0
" ... but we have a better shot with the larger and more rational border zone of the vaccine hesitant who may base their concerns on genuine cases of vaccine harm , such as the very small but accepted link between influenza vaccination and a temporary paralysis called @entity165			2
" cultivating " a strong patient - doctor relationship is the most successful method of reversing vaccine opposition , " he wrote			0
that means carving out a system in which " your doctor is granted the time to truly understand you , while at the same time allowing your doctor to treat you appropriately			0
... if we 've done our job right , you 'll seek out the insights we 've earned from treating many challenging cases over many years			0
and we 'll know we 've succeeded in our new relationship when you let us vaccinate your children			0
" what is your message to those who do n't vaccinate ?			0

26 states have not reached a *federal* target for vaccination
@entity38 has the highest level of vaccination ; @entity34 has the lowest
many parents of unvaccinated children are concerned about side effects , autism and children having too many shots
