-- we just knew they were going to be huge stars , internationally famous , wealthy beyond imagining			2
it was summer 's end , 1965			1
my buddies and i , along with hundreds of other people , gathered in the parking lot of the @entity12 shopping mall in @entity13 , @entity14 , to watch the @entity15			1
the bands were all local kids , just like us , and one of those bands -- the @entity20 -- had something special going for it			1
the lead singer , 18 - year - old @entity22 , possessed the onstage electricity , the lithe movements , the command of each moment , of a @entity27 @entity26			1
you could n't take your eyes off him			1
the band had a terrific , hard - driving new song called " @entity32 " ( it pre-dated the smooth @entity34 tune with similar wording ) , and the @entity36 went to no. 1 with it on the hometown rock station , @entity39			1
we stood there on the surface of the parking lot and watched them in that summer 's waning days , and we felt elevated just to be spending the afternoon in their presence			1
the @entity36 would make two more records -- both of them @entity51 covers : " @entity54 " and " connection " -- each of which also went to no. 1 on @entity39			1
they opened for @entity57 once at a show at @entity59 in @entity13			2
but somehow , despite their talent , nothing happened for the @entity63 nationally			2
three years later , they disbanded			2
and @entity22 ? we did n't know what became of him			1
as this summer of 2012 was winding down , i was visiting central @entity14 and saw that on a friday night , at a place in the town of @entity71 called the @entity73 @entity72 , there was going to be a band called the @entity76 ( " fully tenured rock and roll " ) playing			1
no cover charge , no minimum			0
the lead singer 's name was @entity22			1
so , just before 9 p.m. , i walked in the door			0
i took a seat at the bar as the band was setting up			1
@entity22 came over to say hello			1
he said that for the last 16 years he has worked a daytime job at the @entity87 , arranging guided tours for the public			1
he 's had a number of other jobs , including work at the @entity94 assembly plant in @entity95 , @entity14			1
" what are you doing here ? " he said			0
" seeing you , " i said			0
" it 's the end of the summer , is n't it ? " he grinned , and i told him about watching him sing , 47 summers ago , at the @entity15 at @entity12			1
" you won , " i said			0
" we did n't win , " he said			2
but that was a good thing , because it made us work harder			2
we won the next @entity15 at @entity107			0
" we stood there laughing together , and he told me that all of the guys in the @entity76 do this mainly because they just like it so much			0
the youngest member of the band is in his mid- 50s ; most of them work regular jobs during the week and do this on the weekends			1
there 's not a lot of money in it			0
" i 'd do it for free , " @entity22 said			1
he had been away from music for decades , and he thought he had lost it forever			0
three years ago , he formed this group			0
" @entity127 go play , " he said			0
he , and the @entity76 , did			0
they were wonderful , from the tough , insistent first chords			0
all of the songs were ones made famous by the most renowned bands of their boyhoods : @entity138 ' " @entity137 , " the @entity139 ' " feel a @entity127 , " @entity140 's " like a @entity141 , " the @entity142 ' " @entity136 , " the @entity143 ' " @entity135			0
" to look into the faces of @entity22 and his new bandmates -- @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 -- was to see men who , far along in their lives , had given themselves , on this night , three hours of gladness			1
they were giving it to their audience , too			0
people were up and dancing , singing along			0
later @entity22 would tell me : " it 's the one thing in my whole life that has ever made any sense			1
it 's the one thing i 'm good at			2
" it 's what i am			0
" he knows , now , that he will never be a rich man			0
he knows , now , that fame will not be arriving			0
but he has found this again , after fearing it was gone for good			0
and he has discovered an essential truth that all of us might do well to keep in mind : doing the thing you love -- finding , somehow , a way to do it -- should be mandatory			1
you should n't put it off -- if you wait , if you think you 'll get around to it someday , someday may never come			2
as midnight approached in @entity71 , he was singing lead on the @entity51 ' " @entity178 " : "			0
this could be the last time , this could be the last time			2
" he asked , into the microphone , how the volume was			0
from the bar i caught his eye , smiled , and made a little clockwise motion with my thumb and forefinger			2
i pointed toward the ceiling			0
may be the last time , i do n't know			1
. " none of us knows when that last time -- the last chance to do the thing we were meant to do , the thing that makes us whole -- will come			1
this is the last full weekend of summer			2
next weekend , autumn begins			0
and opportunities for joy , like summer nights , are fleeting and finite			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 : the @entity36 were local band which seemed bound for big time
this summer he saw @entity36 singer playing with new band , the *professors* , in an @entity14 bar
@entity36 did n't make big time , split up and singer @entity22 worked at different jobs
@entity202 : but @entity22 was back performing , doing thing he loved . that should be mandatory
