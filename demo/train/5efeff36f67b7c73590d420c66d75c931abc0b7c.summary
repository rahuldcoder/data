-- @entity1 graces the cover of @entity4 's annual swimsuit issue , barely suited up in @entity6 's early spring weather of about 24 degrees @entity7			1
( with wind chill , it felt like minus 20 degrees )			2
@entity10 does n't show any signs of goose bumps in the pictures			2
she no doubt got the chilliest assignment of the 17 models who posed for this year 's swimsuit issue on seven continents			1
those logistics are the work of @entity4 's senior editor for the swimsuit issue , @entity24 , and her team , who spend most of the year on the road shooting			1
for this year 's 50th annual issue , years of negotiating visas and access paid off in shots on each of the world 's seven continents			1
( @entity4 , like @entity0 , is a division of @entity35			1
) @entity6 was " the ' @entity37 ' pass of our year , " said day , using perhaps the only sports metaphor applicable to the issue , on newsstands february 12			1
" i could have had a blizzard			2
@entity1 could have had shivering fits you could not shoot around			1
( instead ) we had six days of perfect weather			2
" day packed coats and wool socks for that trip in addition to the items more typically in her travel bags : some 500 to 800 bathing suits , double stick tape , clothespins , safety pins , binder clips , liners from the cups of bathing suits ( for use as knee pads ) , suntan lotion , bug spray and flip - flops			1
while @entity67 is a veteran road warrior traveling to many places most people will never see , even she was taken by her adventures this past year			1
here are @entity67 's favorite spots from her year 's travels on each of the continents			1
8 getaways we wish we could afford @entity6 : @entity78 the @entity4 team traveled to @entity6 in early december ( early spring on the frozen continent ) on the @entity82 ship @entity83 , enjoying a rare " six - day stretch of perfect weather " on the journey from @entity87			1
" @entity6 was my favorite place on @entity89 , " said @entity24			1
" i 'm one of the most jaded travelers you will ever meet , but the whole thing was a religious experience			2
" on the journey , they crossed a channel called @entity78 , where twilight arrived around midnight			2
" the sun sets in a shade of orange and mountains turn pink -- not a hint of pink , but as if someone poured pink paint over the mountains			2
you ca n't sleep because it 's too awe - inspiring			1
" the photographer could only shoot @entity10 outside for a couple of minutes at a time before the crew , all bundled from head to toe , would rush to put heating pads in her bathing suit and cover her with electric warming coats			1
" the entire crew surprised her the last day of her ( six - day ) shoot wearing bathing suits as a sign of support and thanks , " said @entity24			1
" i was probably in my suit for five minutes and went so numb			2
" @entity130 : @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 @entity134 is a group of lodges and camps that are part of the privately held @entity132 in the southwest @entity138			2
" i 've been to sandy places such as @entity140 and the @entity141 and seen those endless dunes , but the dunes here were the most intense shade of red i 've ever seen in my life , " said @entity24			0
" the sand in @entity133 has such a high iron content			0
as the iron oxidizes , the redder it becomes			0
the further inland you go , the redder the sand gets : white to orange to insane red			0
" the @entity134 runs on solar power , which means no sounds of generators to disturb the natural beauty			0
the lodge grows some of its own food and runs in partnership with a culinary school , " so the food is incredible , really wholesome , delicious and natural			0
you feel like ' i 'm living and i 'm living right			0
' " " the level of quiet you experience is surreal			0
this is the perfect place to go to when you need to rest your soul			0
" the perfect beach for you @entity169 : @entity171 's @entity170 , @entity172 it took more than two years to negotiate the visas to get into @entity172 to shoot , and @entity24 was n't sure it would ever happen			1
the shoot came to life at @entity171 's @entity170 , an 800 - year - old terraced rice paddy built into the mountains in @entity180			1
" it 's the most ethereal , beautiful , surprising place on @entity89 to me , " said @entity24			1
" these incredibly distinctive mountains were like what kids draw , up and down and up down			0
they were incredibly green , rich , lush and misty in the mornings			0
" the hike is so strenuous up the mountain stairs that many visitors hire the local @entity191 women to act as guides			0
the women of the @entity191 ethnic minority group , who are known for their brightly colored clothing and long hair styled atop their heads , helped the crew haul equipment for the shoots at the bottom and top of the hike , and at points along the way			0
@entity89 's most romantic islands @entity208 : @entity209 , @entity210 it takes a lot for a beach to impress day , who is not impressed by the backdrop that most beaches have to offer a photo shoot			1
@entity209 also was n't an easy spot for a shoot : it takes a 20 - minute seaplane ride or longer boat ride to get there , and there were n't any amenities			1
( just a handful of the 74 islands known as the @entity228 have accommodations			0
) so the team stayed on nearby @entity231 , another one of the @entity210 islands and took off at first light for two days of shooting on the white sand silica beach			0
" it 's quite honestly one of the most beautiful striking and isolated beaches i 've ever been to , " said @entity24			1
" people claim it 's the most pristine beach in the world			1
the water is right off the barrier reef , and it 's this incredible shade of turquoise			1
it 's not close to anything			1
you have to pack in and pack out			0
" @entity247 : @entity248 , @entity249 may adored the elegance of @entity248 , with its blend of @entity253 and @entity249 culture			0
while she and her team usually work wearing t - shirts , baseball caps and jeans , she dressed up a bit for the @entity248 shoots and packed dresses and heels for dinner after work in the capital of @entity249 's sun - splashed @entity267 province			1
" it 's an incredibly ornate city , " she said			1
" people are so regal			0
they get dressed to go out ( anywhere )			0
i do n't think i saw a pair of sweats when i was there			0
and everywhere you look there 's another shot			2
" while she had trouble choosing a favorite spot in @entity248 , she did enjoy shooting in the @entity282 and near the @entity283 , the largest @entity284 building in @entity247			0
they also did photo shoots with horses at an equestrian school " with amazing white stallions , jumping			2
" 7 swanky ski hotels on @entity292 slopes @entity293 : the @entity294 , @entity295 back to the beach , @entity24 chose a spot where she has worked before to shoot the swimsuit issue 's body painting story			1
she values the @entity294 , an archipelago of 365 cays about 35 miles from @entity304 , for its privacy and solitude			0
" you 're not fighting for blanket space on the beach and the waters are perfectly turquoise , " she said			0
" we saw the most glorious sunsets you 've ever seen in your life			0
every day , the tide would change and look different			0
" @entity317 : @entity318 , @entity319 visiting @entity318 has been on may 's bucket list for some time , but even after landing in the remote island , she was n't sure she would get her shot			2
lots of on - site negotiation went into getting permission to shoot close to the sacred @entity329 statues , more than 800 of which were carved from the island 's volcanic stone sometime between the ninth and 17th centuries			1
" everyone knows about it but they 're just getting their hook into tourism , and they 've embraced ecotourism , " she said			0
the differences in topography on @entity318 made for a great shoot : " there are black rocks , deforested planes , the @entity329 jutting out , " said @entity24			2
" they 've replanted a lot and a couple spots look like you 're in @entity352 with white sand beaches			0
" it 's a tough job , but someone 's got to do it			2
can airliners really fly upside down ?			0
