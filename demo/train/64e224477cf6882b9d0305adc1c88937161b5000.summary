helping families build homes was a job that @entity3 excelled at			1
as a sales consultant in @entity6 , @entity7 , she walked people through buying homes , selecting floor plans and customizing everything from doors and windows to counters			0
then the housing market crashed in 2008 , and she was laid off while she was eight weeks pregnant with her first child			1
like many @entity16 who lost their income sources when employers cut more than 1.2 million jobs in the first 10 months of 2008 , she struggled to find her footing			2
as the ripple effects of the recession continue , with monthly unemployment claims up in july , people like @entity22 are seeking alternatives to traditional office jobs and gambling on their passions			1
for @entity22 , that meant learning how to transform her childhood zeal for baking into profits			1
" i wanted to know how to take what i loved doing and make it into a job , " the 35 - year - old mother of two said			2
" i was good at working in the housing market , and it was good to us			2
but being a baker , i am so much more creative now			0
" @entity22 thought she would go back into construction sales , but no jobs materialized			1
instead , she divided her time among caring for her young children , baking and budgeting household expenses on a single income			2
amid the @entity50 spreadsheets and extreme couponing , she wondered what would come next			0
to save money on holiday gifts , she started baking biscotti and realized she loved the process of creating the traditional @entity58 pastry , from dreaming up flavor combinations to kneading dough			1
she never thought baking biscotti was something she could actually do as a career			1
but looking back on her old job , she realizes it did n't stimulate her creative impulses like baking does			1
" every day at my current job , i am being challenged and inspired , " she said			2
" when raspberries come into season , i might start thinking of new recipes			0
my wheels are always turning , and that is what i love			0
" a business without a storefront @entity22 has been baking since she could climb onto a kitchen stool			1
her fondest memories from childhood are sitting in her mother 's kitchen , watching her pipe out elaborate icing designs onto towering wedding cakes and cookies			0
whipping up pumpkin chocolate bread for friends was easy for @entity22			1
but she thought she could n't have a successful business without a brick and mortar store			1
when she started to calculate the cost of opening a kitchen and storefront , the price added up			0
" how do people do this on their own ? " she wondered while visiting farmers ' markets			0
a simple @entity101 search for " how to bake out of your own home " led her to an intriguing alternative : cottage bakeries , in which people cook , grow or make things in their homes to sell to consumers			1
but it did n't take long for her to discover that there was a lot of research , paperwork and technicalities involved			2
each state has its own laws for cottage food operations ( @entity118 )			1
@entity22 researched the rules and regulations of cottage bakery laws ( @entity118 ) , taking out an insurance policy and a limited liability company certificate			1
then , she realized she needed customers			0
her biscotti were already receiving praise from friends and family			2
that encouraged her to drop off three flavors at @entity132 , a @entity133 gourmet grocer , during a manager 's meeting in january			0
within hours , she had her first order			0
since then , she has rolled them out to all three of @entity138 's in - store bakeries			0
since her first order in january , @entity141 's business and confidence have grown			2
she secured a spot at her local farmers ' market and launched her business under the name bites of @entity148			1
her biscotti were even featured on the dessert menu at the @entity150 , an upscale restaurant in downtown @entity133			2
finding a niche she attributes her success to finding a niche market			1
most biscotti sold in stores are made in factories that produce the same typical flavors , like traditional @entity58 almond , anise , orange and pignoli			2
" surprisingly enough , there is little biscotti out there in bakeries , " she said			0
" so it was n't that hard to break into			0
" @entity22 came up with five flavors based on combinations that play on popular culinary trends , like sweet and savory			1
one of her best - sellers , chocolate - caramel pretzel , was inspired by her husband , who challenged her to re-create his favorite candy , salted caramel			0
for those who like to stick with tradition , she has a lemon poppy seed , a cranberry pistachio and a classic @entity58 almond - anise flavor			0
with a recent order of 600 biscotti cookies for a wedding , @entity22 says , she is creating her own @entity16 dream			1
for years , her friends and family worked at and retired from the same companies			0
" but for my generation , things are different , " she said			0
" life can be in stages			0
" for those in a new stage of life right now , @entity22 recommends doing what she tells herself each day : just keep looking forward			1
and if it 's not the plan you came up with right out of college -- or even before college -- do n't be scared			0
" sometimes , we get it wrong , " she said			0
" and sometimes , you need to branch out if what you are doing is n't inspiring you			1
