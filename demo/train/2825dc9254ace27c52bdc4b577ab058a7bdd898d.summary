-- a liberal @entity2 congressman who came under fire for a lewd photo that briefly appeared on his @entity6 account over the weekend told @entity0 wednesday that he did not post the image			1
@entity2 rep. @entity8 spoke to @entity0 's @entity9 a day after a contentious exchange with reporters in which he refused to directly answer any questions about the picture			1
on wednesday he said he had hired a law firm to look into the matter			1
but he declined to directly answer whether he appeared in the photo			0
" photos can be manipulated			0
photos can be of one thing and changed to something else			0
we 're going to try to get to the bottom of what happened , " he said			0
the photo showed the lower body of a man wearing underwear			0
a conservative blogger who broke the story has called for a full investigation of what he said was either the hacking of a congressman 's account or something @entity8 wants to hide			1
but @entity8 told @entity0 he did not think such steps are necessary to deal with what he said was internet spam , an issue that many @entity41 face			1
" just because it happened to @entity43 on his personal account does n't mean that the taxpayers should pay for an investigation , " he said			1
" i 'm going to turn it over to some people who are going to give me advice on what to do next			0
" this seems like it was a prank to make fun of my name , the name @entity8			1
it happens a lot , " he added			0
asked whether he was protecting anyone , @entity8 replied , " yes , i 'm protecting my wife , who every day is waking up to these insane stories that are getting so far from reality			1

" he also declined to say what he had written in direct messages to @entity6 followers			2
" i 'm not going to get into how i communicate with people on social media			0
there was nothing ... inappropriate , " he said			0
an e-mail that @entity6 sent to members of @entity74 wednesday lists several online security tips , according to a copy of the e-mail @entity0 obtained			1
the message does not specifically mention the photo posted on @entity8 's page , but notes that questions about account security have surged recently			1
" some of you inquired today about the security of @entity6 accounts , " @entity6 's @entity83 wrote			1
" while we wo n't comment on individual accounts , news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials			0
" @entity8 on tuesday told reporters he was n't interested in talking about the issue any more , saying he already made statements over the @entity97 weekend after the photo turned up on his @entity6 account friday night			1
in a heated exchange with reporters , he repeatedly dodged direct questions about the photo			1
" if i were giving a speech to 45,000 people , and someone in the back threw a pie or yelled out an insult , i would not spend the next two hours of my speech responding to that pie or that insult			0
i would return to the things that i want to talk about , " @entity8 said in response to a question about whether he sent the lewd photo to a @entity116 woman			1
he also refused to say why he has n't asked law enforcement to investigate if in fact his account was hacked , as he has said it was			2
despite repeated efforts by reporters , @entity8 did not directly answer questions about the photo			1
in earlier comments , when asked if the photo was of him , @entity8 deflected the question			1
" i 'm not going to talk about this anymore , " he said , adding : " i 'm going to get back to the conversation i care about , " including economic issues and what he calls a conflict - of - interest situation involving conservative @entity133 @entity132 on the health care reform law			0

when asked if he was concerned about being hacked , he responded : " i 'm going to return to working on the things i care about			0
i participated in the story a couple of days now , given comments on it			0
this is a distraction and i 'm not going to let it distract me			0
" when a reporter noted the distraction might go away if he answered the questions , @entity8 answered : " i 'm not convinced of that			2
" i 'm not convinced there 's any value of me talking about it , " @entity8 said			2
asked again if he was the man in the photo , @entity8 responded again that he had made previous statements and now it was time for him to get back to work			1
on wednesday , @entity8 told @entity0 that he regretted " the way that i handled it yesterday and i 'm trying to do a better job today			2
" previously , @entity8 blamed the photo on a hacker who got control of his social - networking accounts and played a prank			1
@entity8 's spokesman , @entity169 , said monday the congressman has retained an attorney to look into the situation			2
no formal criminal investigation has been launched , which rankles @entity174 , whose conservative website biggovernment.com first reported the photo on @entity8 's @entity6 account in connection with a tweet to a @entity116 woman			1
@entity174 , who has been involved in questionable tactics against @entity2 and liberals in the past , told @entity0 on tuesday that the case warrants further investigation			2
" there 's something fundamentally different between a prank and a hack -- a prank is innocuous , a hack is criminal , " @entity174 said , later adding he wanted a full investigation by the @entity185 and @entity186			0
however , @entity0 legal analyst @entity193 said tuesday he believed the situation was a harmless prank unworthy of further investigation			2
" @entity6 is not a very secure environment , " @entity193 said , noting that information on the site can be unreliable " and does n't even come from the people it appears to come from			0
" he added : " there 's a famous expression -- do n't make a federal case out of it			0
" @entity0 's @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this story .			0
