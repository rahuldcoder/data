-- @entity1 likely never made it to the @entity3			1
the 18 - year - old set out 10 years ago from his native @entity4 in search of opportunity and a better way of life			2
but he had to travel north through @entity10 first			2
a short while after leaving , he called his parents to tell them he had been beaten and robbed in @entity10 , left penniless and without shoes or clothes			2
it was the last they heard from him			0
while it 's not certain that @entity1 is dead , he probably suffered the same fate as 72 migrants from @entity20 and @entity21 whose bodies were found this week in a ranch in northern @entity10 , just 90 miles from the @entity3 border			1
officials are investigating whether they were the victims of human traffickers or drug cartels that prey on migrants			1
it 's a fate that officials say befalls thousands of @entity20 and @entity21 every year			1
" it 's brutal , " says @entity30 , president emeritus of the @entity31 , a non-partisan @entity32 policy institute			0
" this is very big business			2
" it is indeed big business			0
human trafficking is one of the most lucrative forms of crime worldwide after drug and arms trafficking , the @entity37 said in april			2
in @entity10 , it is a $ 15 billion - to $ 20 billion - a - year endeavor , second only to drug trafficking , said @entity46 , founding director of @entity47 , an online information network focused on @entity49			1
" and that may be a conservative estimate , " @entity46 said			0
that money , which used to go mostly to smugglers , now also flows into the hands of drug cartel members			2
the @entity56 , a bipartisan , nonprofit policy institute based in @entity32 , noted in an august report that human smuggling and other illegal activities are playing an increasingly important role as narcotraffickers diversify their activities			1
" the drug cartels have not confined themselves to selling narcotics , " the report said			1
" they engage in kidnapping for ransom , extortion , human smuggling and other crimes to augment their incomes			1
" some cartels have come to rely more in recent years on human smuggling			1
" for the @entity75 , it 's been one of their main revenue streams for years , " @entity46 said about the vicious cartel , which operates mostly in northeastern @entity10			1
cartel involvement has increased the risk for migrants crossing through @entity10 to get to the @entity3 , said @entity10 's @entity82			1
an investigation by the commission showed that 9,758 migrants were abducted from september 2008 to february 2009 , or about 1,600 per month			0
no one knows exactly how many people try to make the passage every year			0
the human rights organization @entity89 estimates it as tens of thousands			1
more than 90 percent of them are @entity20 , mostly from @entity4 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity89 said in a report this year			2
and the vast majority of these migrants , the rights group said , are headed for the @entity3			1
" their journey is one of the most dangerous in the world , " @entity89 said			1
" every year , thousands of migrants are kidnapped , threatened or assaulted by members of criminal gangs , " the rights group said			1
" extortion and sexual violence are widespread and many migrants go missing or are killed			0
few of these abuses are reported and in most cases those responsible are never held to account			0
" an indication of how many people attempt the trip can be found in statistics compiled by @entity10 's @entity117 , which tracks how many migrants are detained and returned to their countries of origin each year			1
experts note that these are only the migrants who get caught , and that many -- even most -- are not apprehended			0
nonetheless , the @entity10 agency said it detained 64,061 migrants last year , 60,383 of whom were from @entity4 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
about 20 percent of them were females and about 8 percent were under the age of 18			0
officials in @entity4 , where the teen - aged @entity1 started his trip , estimate that about 10,000 @entity20 migrants suffered some kind of abuse in 2009			1
" the vast majority has been committed by these organized crime gangs , such as the @entity75 for example , in the route along the @entity141 ( of @entity10 ) , which is where they operate most frequently , " said @entity135 , the @entity4 vice minister for citizens living abroad			2
" but we also have found events in which ( @entity10 ) authorities have participated , " @entity135 said			2
the @entity4 @entity147 estimates up to 150 citizens leave each day for @entity10			2
some analysts put that figure at closer to 300			0
for most @entity20 , that journey begins with a human smuggler , commonly called a " pollero			1
" in the @entity3 , the smugglers are better known as " coyotes			1
" for a set fee , usually ranging from $ 850 to $ 5,000 a head , a smuggler will deliver a migrant to the border of the @entity3 or even offer passage across			1
problems often arise when smugglers and migrants approach the border and organized crime organizations get involved			2
" this is where things get complicated , " said @entity46 , who is writing a book on the @entity75 and is the author of " this is for the @entity170 : inside the @entity175 's @entity174			0
" the drug - trafficking organizations charge the " polleros " a price per person for the right to cross over their territory , a practice called " @entity184 , " or right of passage			0
or they will abduct the migrants and hold them for ransom from their relatives and friends in the @entity3 or family back home			1
often times , the @entity37 said , migrants who are abducted are subjected to sexual or labor exploitation			0
if the migrants are being held for ransom and the money is not paid in time , the situation can get ugly			0
" sometimes the @entity10 organized crime group says , ' the hell with it			1
we 're not going to deal with these people , ' and they kill them all , " @entity46 said			0
that 's what may have happened , @entity46 said , to the 72 people whose bodies were found tuesday in a ranch building in @entity211 state , about 14 miles ( 22 kilometers ) from the town of @entity213 , near the border with @entity215			0
or the migrants may have refused to work for the cartel , which is one possibility that has been mentioned in news accounts			0
a bloody turf war between the @entity75 and the @entity141 cartels also may have complicated matters because the smugglers may not have known who to pay or may have paid one group and angered the other			1
" in @entity211 , it 's very hard for a pollero to know who is who , " @entity46 said			0
" the @entity75 and @entity141 cartels were once allied and now have split			0
" at any rate , the involvement of the drug cartels has changed the dynamics of human smuggling in @entity10 , said @entity237 , director of the @entity239 's @entity238			1
@entity237 remembers living in northern @entity10 a few years back and knowing that a father - son duo who lived on his block were " polleros			1
" " that 's gone , " @entity237 said , noting that the costs of having to pay cartels for the right to cross their territory has driven out small - time smugglers			2
" they now have to be big enough to handle those costs , " @entity237 said			0
@entity237 and the @entity31 's @entity30 point out that increased border security and interdiction by the @entity3 also has led to cartel involvement because of the level of sophistication and complexity now often involved in getting someone across the border			2
the cartels already have the routes and other facilities in place they use for smuggling drugs			2
" we 're no longer talking about a simple process that involves one or two individuals , " @entity237 said			0
" this has become much more dangerous			0
" as always , profit is the motive			0
" the smuggling became profitable the more the @entity3 began to build barriers to immigration , " @entity30 said			1
on thursday , @entity89 called on the @entity10 government to take swift action about the slayings of the 72 people in @entity211			2
" @entity89 issued a report in april highlighting the failure of @entity10 federal and state authorities to implement effective measures to prevent and punish thousands of kidnappings , killings and rape of irregular migrants at the hands of criminal gangs , who often operate with the complicity or acquiescence of public officials , " the rights group said in a release			1
" this case once again demonstrates the extreme dangers faced by migrants and the apparent inability of both federal and state authorities to reduce the attacks that migrants face			0
the response of the authorities to this case will be a test			0
" it 's too late for the families of the victims			0
for the parents of @entity1 , the @entity4 who disappeared 10 years ago , much of the anguish lies in not knowing what happened			0
" if only he would call me on the telephone and i would know he is alive , even if i never saw him again , that would satisfy me , " said his father , @entity312			0
for thousands of @entity20 families , the phone does not ring			1
journalist @entity318 contributed to this report .			0

the road to the @entity3 goes through @entity10 for @entity20
the journey is " one of the most dangerous in the world , " rights group says
thousands of migrants are abused each years by smugglers and drug cartels
human smuggling may be a $ 20 billion business in @entity10
