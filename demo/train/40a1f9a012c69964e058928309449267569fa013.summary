-- @entity1 is moving from the " @entity2 " to the " @entity3			1
" soccer star @entity4 will take former popstar wife @entity5 and their four children back to @entity8 , with big - spending @entity10 club @entity9 confirming that the former @entity12 captain has passed a medical and signed a short - term deal ahead of thursday 's transfer deadline			1
the 37 - year - old was later unveiled at a press conference , ending speculation about his next destination following the end of his six - year spell with @entity24 @entity23 team @entity22 in early december			1
@entity1 said he will donate the wages earned during his five - month contract to a children 's charity in @entity3			1
" it 's something exciting and something i 'm not sure has been done before , " he told reporters , and revealed that his family will be based in his hometown @entity32			1
he had been linked with a host of clubs around the world but , in the twilight of his career , has decided to join a team on the rise thanks to the injection of hundreds of millions of dollars by its @entity44 owners			2
" it 's simply a very nice piece of short - term brand alignment that will be mutually beneficial to both parties , " sports business expert @entity45 told @entity0			1
@entity1 is one of the world 's most recognisable names , both for his sporting prowess and numerous off - pitch endorsement deals , and his pulling power could provide a valuable income stream for @entity9 -- which must conform to @entity58 football 's financial fair play rules that restrict over-spending by club owners			1
" i think it 's very difficult to quantify , " @entity45 said			2
" he 's been away from @entity8 for too long -- he 's now really in his twilight years , we do n't know what part he 'll play in the team , we do n't know how he 'll be used for commercial purposes , we do n't know how the @entity10 public will respond			1
" and we do n't know how international fans will engage with and consume the @entity9 / @entity1 brand			1
we may see a spike in activity such as increases in ticket sales , but i am not entirely convinced that there 'll be a significant sustainable stream of revenues			2
" however , one leading football executive who had unsuccessfully tried to persuade @entity1 to join his team said that the midfielder still had a strong role to play on and off the pitch			0
" not only were we looking for a playmaker in midfield but also a leader in the dressing room and someone to set the standards on and off the pitch			0
@entity1 would have brought all that , " the executive told @entity0 on condition of anonymity			0
" @entity93 would have ensured exposure and possibly commercial opportunities , but without the quality as a player it would n't have been at all interesting			0
" @entity1 had the chance to join @entity9 in january 2012 , but opted to stay in the @entity24 , ending his @entity24 mission with his second @entity101 title before announcing that he would not fulfill the second year of his contract extension			1
" i chose @entity3 because i can see what the club are trying to do			1
i can see who the club are trying to bring in , " he said thursday			0
" it 's an exciting city and now there 's a club that 's going to have a lot of success over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years			1
i 'm very honored i 've been picked to be part of the future of @entity9			1
" one man who saw him up close in the @entity24 believes the former @entity116 and @entity117 star still has what it takes to perform on the big stage			1
" at first it is like the marketing -- you bring in him more for the brand than the player , " said former @entity9 defender @entity121 , who played in the @entity23 for @entity122 in 2011			1
" but when i watched him in the @entity23 he still has the physical condition to play at the highest level			0
on the pitch he can add a lot			0
" they are not signing him for his ability to sprint -- it 's his technique and vision			2
he has that ability to elevate his game depending on the opposition			0
he can play a part for @entity9 in both @entity140 and @entity141			1
" " @entity146 " are seeking to win the @entity10 title for the first time since 1994 , having been runner - up last season			2
the club 's owners , the @entity149 , have splashed out on top players such as @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 since taking over in 2011			2
@entity156 's team tops the @entity140 table on goal difference after 22 of 38 rounds in the 2012 - 13 campaign , and will play in the knockout phase of @entity8 's top club competition in a two - legged tie against @entity165 club @entity164 on february 12 and march 6			1
former @entity166 coach @entity156 managed @entity1 during the former @entity12 captain 's first loan spell with the @entity170 club in 2009			2
however , @entity1 might be struggling to be fit for those matches , according to the manager of @entity12 club @entity173 -- who allowed the veteran to train with his squad this month			0
" he told me that he does n't look at all to be in shape			0
@entity1 is super-ambitious , " @entity179 told reporters this week			0
" if , in his mind , he wanted to play in the @entity182 he would not have gone on holiday			0
he would have prepared and come in and tried to impress me			0
he told me he has done nothing at all			0
" @entity1 admitted it might take " a few weeks " to get fully fit			0
" it wo n't take long , " he said			0
he explained that he could not play for another club in @entity12 except @entity116 , where he won six @entity182 titles and the @entity141 before moving to @entity165 in 2003			0
" it 's the team i support and the team i dreamed of playing for , " said @entity1 , who to @entity189 as a teenager and progressed through the club 's academy			2
" i 'm very honored by the offers i had from other @entity182 clubs but i did n't want to play there unless it was for @entity116			0
