@entity0 -- a designer has come up with a unique and futuristic solution for speeding up rail travel : he does n't want to change the engines , or the tracks -- he wants to get rid of the stations			0
determined to take rail transport into the 21st century , @entity8 , director of @entity10 design group @entity9 , is the man behind the " @entity12 " concept , which he believes could potentially revolutionize the rail industry			1
his scheme would see travelers served by a carousel of trams and high - speed trains that would take passengers from their homes to their destinations without them ever having to use a bus , car or taxi			2
" the idea with moving platforms is that ... if you were going on holiday or on business for instance , you could get onto a tram on your street and then seamlessly travel from that onto the high - speed line and then get off at your destination in another city , then onto a tram and then end up at your destination without ever having gone in your car or perhaps got on a bus , " says @entity8			1
" it 's totally integrated into a sort of larger transport system , " he adds			2
the idea is to have a city - wide network of trams that travel in a loop and connect with a high - speed rail service			0
read more : how green is @entity50 ? but instead of passengers having to get off the tram at a rail station and wait for the next @entity50 service to arrive , the moving tram would " dock " with a moving train , allowing passengers to cross between tram and train without either vehicle ever stopping			1
" the trams speed up and the high - speed train slows down and they join , so they dock at high speed , " explains @entity8			1
" they stay docked for the same amount of time that it would stop at a station , " he adds			0
" there are big doors , there are wide doors , they 're all the same level so you can seamlessly go between the two vehicles quite peacefully ; there 's no hurry			0
" then , when everyone 's done that , the doors shut and then the trains separate and the tram then goes back into the city or town and picks up more passengers and drops off passengers			1
" instead of using paper tickets to pass through a barrier , passengers would used an @entity87 ( radio - frequency identification ) system to transfer from tram to train			1
similar systems that let passengers scan pre-paid smartcards are already used on many public transport networks			0
while @entity8 admits that it will be some time before his vision could be implemented , he says the time has come to rethink how we travel			2
" this idea is a far - future thought but would n't it be brilliant to just re-evaluate and just re-think the whole process ? " he says .			0

" moving platforms " is an integrated tram - to - train concept
passengers would cross between tram and train without either vehicle stopping
it 's the work of @entity10 designer @entity8
