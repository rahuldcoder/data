-- responding to simmering controversy among @entity3 bloggers about her new birth control program , @entity6 -- a practicing @entity3 -- said she will not shrink from her role as an advocate for poor women			1
" part of what i do with the ( @entity6 ) foundation comes from that incredible social justice i had growing up and belief that all lives , all lives are of equal value , " said @entity6 during a recent interview with @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity12			1
about the flak over her @entity3 she said : " we 're not going to agree about everything , but that 's ok			2
" @entity6 is promoting an ambitious family planning program -- which includes raising billions of dollars to provide contraceptives to 120 million women worldwide -- at the @entity29 on @entity30 july 11			2
while most @entity34 , in the @entity33 , at least , according to polls , seem to agree with @entity6 that contraception for women is not controversial , some @entity3 bloggers are taking issue with the plan			1
one blog in particular , @entity40 , has frequently published diatribes against @entity6 , calling into question her faith , and calling her plan a " blatant attack on @entity3 sexual morality			1
" as far as the broader catholic church stance on the @entity6 program , @entity0 requested a comment from the @entity50 , but did not get a response			2
my take : catholic bishops against the common good for her part , @entity6 is trying to deflect the controversy , and concentrate on what she describes as a real need for contraception to empower women			2
" i think we made birth control and contraceptives way too political in the @entity33 , " said @entity6 , co-founder of the @entity61			1
" i think if people understood that 200 million women want this around the world they would start to say , ' ok that makes sense			0
' ... we should n't make it such a political issue			0
" overheard : contraceptives and @entity3 according to the @entity61 website , the focus of the family planning initiative will be on urban areas in @entity78 and @entity79 , areas where maternal and infant mortality rates are high and contraception use is low			1
" @entity78 's the one place really in the world , for the most part , that contraceptives have n't been available and it 's really been a crime , " said @entity6			2
" if you see what 's happened in other countries that have had contraceptives , they use them first of all and the birth rates go down			0
... the question is could it have come down even more quickly ? " @entity6 frequently cites research from a decades - long study in @entity98 as a rationale for family planning			0
given the ability to space out their children using birth control , women can begin what @entity6 calls a " virtuous economic cycle			1
" the study , started in the 1970s in @entity109 , compared a group with access to contraception and birth - control education to a similar group that did not have access to those things			1
my take : the myth and reality of the @entity3 vote " ( in ) the community that had access to contraceptives , the women chose to use them , the families grew up wealthier , fewer women died in childbirth , " said @entity6			1
" and what we 're seeing happening with that is that it 's playing out again all over the world			0
these small scale things you have in terms of giving a family the access leads to huge economic changes			0
" to effect that cascade of economic change worldwide will take $ 4 billion , according to @entity6			0
the @entity143 summit kicks off the @entity61 's official campaign for support and funding for that effort			0
no doubt , the family planning initiative will roll out despite @entity3 protestations , and @entity6 says this is the issue for which she hopes to be remembered			1
" i work on a broad set of foundation issues , " said @entity6			2
" but this one for me has really grasped my heart and my mind			0
she added : " this will be my lifetime 's work at the foundation			0
