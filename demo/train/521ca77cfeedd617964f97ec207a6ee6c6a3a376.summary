-- the pilot of a tanker that crashed into the @entity4 in 2007 , causing a major oil spill , was under the influence of multiple prescription medications that impaired his judgment , federal officials said in a report wednesday			1
the november 2007 crash left a gash in the tanker 's side and led to an oil spill that killed more than 2,000 birds			1
the @entity16 said the pilot of the @entity19 - registered @entity18 , was " medically unfit " on november 7 , 2007			1
that , and a master pilot 's poor oversight of his performance , were major factors in the crash that dumped 53,000 gallons of oil into the bay , the @entity16 said			1
" how a man who was taking a half - dozen impairing prescription medications got to stand on the bridge of a 68,000 - ton ship and give directions to guide the vessel through a foggy bay and under a busy highway bridge is very troubling , " said acting @entity16 chairman @entity28			1
the pilot , @entity38 , was charged with criminal negligence in federal court last year			0
he faces two misdemeanor charges that could result in up to 18 months in prison and $ 115,000 in fines			0
the 901 - foot ship left @entity45 , @entity46 , en route to @entity48 when @entity49 gave orders that steered the ship directly toward a support tower on the bridge			0
while the ship avoided a direct hit , it hit a support system at the tower 's base , cutting a 212 - foot gash in the ship 's side , the @entity16 said			2
the board ruled that @entity49 and @entity65 master pilot @entity63 never thoroughly discussed a plan before they took off on a foggy night when visibility was less than a quarter - mile			2
the oil spill killed about 2,500 birds of 50 different species , according to the report			1
the crash caused more than $ 70 million in environmental cleanup costs , $ 2 million in damage to the ship and $ 1.5 million in damage to the bridge			0
the report also blamed the ship 's operator , @entity78 , for not properly training crew members and the @entity81 for not providing adequate medical oversight of the pilot			2
it said the @entity81 should have revoked the pilot 's license , the pilot should have given a meaningful pre-departure briefing about plans for the voyage and the master pilot should have taken a more active role in ensuring the ship 's safety			0
" there was a lack of competence in so many areas that this accident seemed almost inevitable , " @entity28 said .			0
