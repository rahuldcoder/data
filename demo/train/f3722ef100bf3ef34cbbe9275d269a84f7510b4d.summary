with the release of her new lp , " @entity16 , " the world is getting a glimpse of a more adult @entity18			1
@entity0 sat down with the multi-hyphenate on the morning of her birthday , and she opened up about how much she 's grown since leaving teendom behind			1
" the past year and a half has been really transitional for me , just personally , as well as transitioning into becoming a woman , " she said			1

" for this album , @entity18 drew inspiration from her favorite pop star , @entity32 , as well as from her good friend @entity33 for a more mature sound			1
the former " @entity36 " starlet revealed she is most proud of this album because it is the first time she was able to dedicate herself fully to her music			1
" i was able to have full creative control over it			0
before , i would have maybe a month or two to record an album , and i 'd have to do my series at the same time and tour on the weekends			1
i was n't in the right mindset to fully give my all			0
" @entity18 began acting professionally at a young age , nabbing roles in children 's programs such as " @entity52			1
" as more former child stars are seen heading down dark and destructive paths , @entity18 has always made a conscious effort to keep from falling down the same rabbit hole			1
the secret ? it all comes down to the company you keep			0
" i truly believe that you are who you surround yourself with			0
to me , it 's that easy			2
i have a great family , i have great friends , and my mom is like my mama bear			0
she 's the one that 's going to tell me ' no ' when everyone around me says ' yes			2
' it 's a good thing to have a tight group that will keep you in check			2
" " @entity16 " is a very personal album , @entity18 said			1
expectations for the disc are high , following three @entity77 debuts from her previous albums			2
" @entity80 " marked @entity18 's first single to break into the @entity77 on the @entity81			1
with a 64 - date arena tour on the horizon , the performer is determined to strike while the iron 's hot			2
" i really just want to give it my all			0
i 've never been this tired			0
dancing so much , singing constantly , just getting it tight			0
we want the show to be really big			0
i want it to be big , but in a grand way , just having my dancers and just bringing it to life			0
" despite her hectic schedule and speculation about whether she 'll rekindle her relationship with @entity98 , @entity18 said she has no plans for a break in the near future			1
in fact , it may not be long before fans will be treated to album no. 5			2
" i 'm already in the studio now			0
