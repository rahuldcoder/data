-- the @entity1 is the most famous horse race in @entity3 -- and , arguably , the world			1
dating back to 1780 , it has spawned many imitations -- 140 countries now have a " @entity1 , " perhaps most notably in the @entity9 state of @entity10			1
indeed , the word " derby " is now generally used to describe any race for three - year - olds			2
" to me it 's the most significant race in the world , " says trainer @entity15 , whose @entity17 stables have yards named after great @entity1 winners of the past , such as @entity19 and @entity20			1
" there are more valuable races , but you ca n't buy 200 years of history			0
it is a very special event for anyone who is @entity3			2
it 's still very much the race that everyone wants to win			2
" the @entity1 counts the @entity31 as one of its biggest fans			1
she has attended all but two derbies during her reign and will be there on june 2 as she kicks off her weekend of jubilee celebrations with a visit to @entity40			1
the race is named after its founder , the 12th @entity43 who , along with his friend sir @entity44 , conceived the idea of a race to establish which horse was the best of his or her generation			2
today it draws crowds of up to 200,000 people , attracted by the sight of the best three - year - olds from @entity56 -- and ever further afield -- competing for a purse of more than $ 2 million			0
@entity19 won the race in 1886 , while fellow @entity60 champion @entity20 -- also stabled at @entity17 -- did so in 1899			0
but there 's one name that means more to the folk at @entity15 's @entity17 headquarters than any other -- @entity65			1
trained by @entity15 's father @entity66 , @entity65 was considered by many to be the greatest racehorse of his day			1
he easily won the 1971 @entity1 by two lengths from @entity70 before going on to capture the @entity71 in @entity72 later that year			1
he does n't just have a yard named after him , he has his own statue			0
now , 41 years after @entity65 's victory , @entity15 believes he has a colt capable of emulating the feats of one of the greatest racehorses of the last century -- a sleek dark bay by the name of @entity82			1
the horse booked his place in saturday 's race thanks to a sparkling performance in the @entity87 at @entity88 in may			2
but @entity15 concedes that his spirited personality makes getting the best from the colt something of a challenge			2
" he is very talented but he is quite a character -- not the most straightforward to train ! " as such he has been only lightly raced , and will go into @entity94 with just three starts under his belt			0
" it 's not ideal , " concedes @entity15			2
" at least he 's got @entity99 experience ( the sport 's top level of competition ) from last year , so we know he is the caliber of horse that should be running in the @entity1			1
" @entity15 took over the reins of the racing operation from his father in 2003 and tasted immediate success when his filly @entity110 captured the @entity111 -- the fillies ' equivalent of the @entity1 -- in june of that year			1
@entity66 remains a familiar presence on the yard , riding out every day on his retired racehorse , @entity117			1
he is an avuncular figure to many of the young exercise riders , although where training matters are concerned he is happy to defer to his son these days			0
the legacy of @entity65 is harder to shake off			2
his statue takes pride of place at @entity17 , an imperious presence watching over his young pretenders as the mist rolls in from the @entity131			0
bred in the @entity9 , the half - cousin to the great @entity133 was sent to the @entity3 as a yearling as it was thought that his action was better suited to the turf tracks of @entity138 than the dirt courses of his native continent			2
it was a gamble that paid off			0
in 14 starts , he failed to win just twice , most memorably in the @entity143 -- the first of the @entity56 " classics " -- when he was beaten by brigadier general , who would go on to prove himself one of the greatest milers of all time			0
but it was his performance in the @entity1 that year that earned @entity65 his place in the pantheon of greats : cruising around @entity157 in fourth place , any doubts over his ability to handle the mile - and - a - half distance were dispelled as soon he passed the two - furlong pole			1
from that point on the result was never in doubt			0
but if it was his exploits in the @entity1 that brought him to the attention of those outside the racing world , it was what happened to him next that cemented his position in the public 's affection			0
it was during a routine training gallop that the colt stumbled and shattered his leg , bringing his racing career to a grotesque and bitter end			0
an injury such as @entity65 's is almost always fatal			0
but rather than euthanize the colt , a veterinary specialist was flown in to operate			0
during the course of the six - hour operation , a metal plate and three screws were inserted into the damaged leg			0
he would never race again , but his life had been saved			0
if @entity82 is to emulate his illustrious predecessor , he will have to get past a strong field including @entity192 's unbeaten colt @entity193 , who goes into the @entity1 having already captured the @entity143			1
@entity192 's second and third strings , astrology and @entity197 , have both impressed on recent outings			0
in any other year , @entity82 would probably be considered the favorite to land @entity56 's premier @entity201 , but @entity193 holds that position with the @entity3 bookmakers			1
@entity82 will be partnered in the @entity1 , as usual , by @entity204 , who will be hoping for better luck in running than their last outing at @entity99 level , when he finished third behind @entity209			1
@entity210 is adept at managing @entity82 's quirks but he 'll need all his experience to cope with the famously fast @entity94 course ( the track rises 150 feet in the first half - mile , leveling out before a downhill stretch round @entity157 )			0
" my father managed to win the @entity1 with a great horse , who was one of the most famous horses of the last century , " says @entity15			1
" it would be lovely to do it again			0
" the stone masons of @entity17 had better be prepared to work overtime after @entity1 , because there might just be a yard with @entity82 's name on it .			1

@entity15 hoping to emulate his father @entity66 by training an @entity1 winner
the racehorse trainer is hoping that stud by the name of @entity82 will win famous @entity3 race
@entity237 enjoyed success in the 1971 derby with his horse @entity65
@entity31 will attend @entity1 on june 2 as part of her @entity244 celebrations
