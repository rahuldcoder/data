@entity0 , @entity1 -- the dragon is the @entity5 counterpart of the phoenix rising from the ashes of destruction			1
and as we bring in the @entity10 monday , the most important of the years in the @entity11 , let 's consider a great opportunity -- and an awe - inspiring responsibility -- to create an ethical world together			1
the challenge we must face : every day , throughout the world , mothers , fathers , sons and daughters are arbitrarily detained , tortured and denied access to counsel and basic due process rights -- causing untold human suffering , perpetuating patterns of violence and impunity , and sapping vast economic potential			2
we may think of torture as a last - resort instrument of authoritarian regimes or rogue groups to extract information from political prisoners , but torture is a much more common occurrence than that			1
more than 100 countries -- including some we describe as democratic -- practice some sort of torture , often on a massive scale , and most of the tortured are not even political prisoners			1
torture is actually used most of the time just because it is the cheapest form of investigation , less expensive than building a proper legal system			1
@entity49 : what 's the right thing to do ? in the midst of this crisis exists an urgent opportunity			2
of the 113 developing countries that , according to our database , practice torture , 93 have taken a strong first step in favor of human rights by signing international conventions and adopting domestic laws that safeguard the rights of ordinary citizens			1
unfortunately , many of these laws remain unenforced due to a lack of trained lawyers , a lack of awareness of what respect for human rights really means , and a lack of resources to turn the situation around			0
these critical gaps allow entirely preventable human rights violations to occur over and over again , despite a legal framework being in place and governments being willing to accept international support			1
i first came to this realization in 1994 when i walked into a prison in @entity86 and met a 12 - year - old boy who was tortured and denied counsel -- for stealing a bicycle			1
over time , i came to realize that the vast majority of torture cases actually happen to everyday citizens throughout the world and not to political prisoners			1
and yet the global community spends the majority of its efforts on political prisoners and on punitive measures as opposed to preventive measures that create positive change			0
suddenly , when i looked into that @entity86 boy 's eyes , it became clear : precisely because he was not a political prisoner , the @entity86 government had no interest in the boy , for better or worse			0
this was the way the police did their work			0
they did n't need to build a case based on evidence ; they roughed up the suspects to get a confession			0
thus , we recognized the opportunity to help him , and the many thousands like him throughout the world			0
this is the mission of @entity126 ( @entity126 ) , which was born 12 years ago , in the last @entity10			0
@entity49 : the global power shift in those years , defenders from throughout the world have joined our cause , seeking justice for the poorest of the poor , training local officials , and literally defending life and human dignity			0
from @entity5 to @entity136 , from @entity137 to @entity138 , we see the seeds of justice starting to grow			1
our starting point is not instances of torture and broken legal systems			1
we focus instead on the attainment of functioning courthouses , competent police officers , trained legal defenders , resulting in ordinary citizens everywhere encountering justice rather than brutality			1
our challenge is to breathe life into existing legal frameworks , to stop investigative torture before it occurs , and to create a culture where the rule of law and respect for due process and human rights is the norm			1
yes , this sounds incredible			0
many would say it is simply not possible			1
yet in in the country where i first encountered the 12 - year - old tortured boy , @entity126 today now represents indigent defendants in 13 out of @entity86 's 24 provinces			1
in those provinces where @entity126 has its legal aid centers , investigative torture today is virtually eliminated , a dramatic turnaround from a culture of abuse and impunity in a few short years ' time			1
@entity86 's government has asked @entity126 to work on helping to build a legal aid system			2
we trained the police , we empowered the defense lawyers , we raised the population 's awareness -- and where we work , torture is now the exception and not the rule			2
imagine a 36 - year - old @entity187 woman , held in pretrial detention for nine years			2
only after an @entity126 lawyer intervened did she regain her freedom and see her children again			0
and this story is one of the least unpleasant ones			0
at least she had not been severely tortured , raped or abused			0
despite overwhelming challenges , courageous defenders are having the prophetic imagination to see a world without abuse and torture and are fashioning this hope into reality			2
they are enabling their countries to rise from the ashes of destruction by rebuilding stable societies through the safeguards of their legal system			1
for the latter half of the 20th century , as human rights became an important factor in international relations , activists played an excellent role in raising awareness of problems			2
but we 've reached a point where there is only so much that this can accomplish			0
if we learn about abuses and only prosecute abuse after the fact , what good does that do ? instead of optimizing the approach by doing the same thing only a bit more effectively , we need to innovate -- that is , we need to do something new entirely			0
we ca n't play the game by the rule of the tormentors , whereby they torture and we decry			2
we wo n't always lose , but we 'll never win			0
we need to act before the torture happens in the first place			2
a shift is taking place toward upholding human rights through legal rights -- using the infrastructure of the public justice system to ensure that basic protections are upheld			2
the payoff is preventing abuse , rather than exposing mistreatment and prosecuting after the fact			0
just having a lawyer supervise the process of a suspect 's detainment puts police and prosecutors on notice that they are being watched not just by a defender , but by society at large			0
there was a time when it was impossible to imagine a world without polio			0
there was a time when it was impossible to imagine the abolition of apartheid			0
but that did not stop those who believed in a better world , and i believe we can stop the use of investigative torture in the 21st century			1
let us rise up from the ashes of destruction and create our ethical future together			0
join the conversation on @entity280 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity283 .			1

@entity283 : in too many countries , torture is simply a cheap investigative tool
she says the way to stop such torture is to develop functioning legal and court systems
@entity283 : use the most important year in the @entity5 *zodiac* to end the use of torture
