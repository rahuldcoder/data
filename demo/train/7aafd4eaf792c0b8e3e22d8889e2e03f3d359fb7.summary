-- they were elected to serve their small towns , but recently , mayors throughout @entity5 have found themselves the targets of violent killings believed to be perpetrated by drug cartels			1
as the cartels face challenges from the military and rival cartels , many of the groups have sought to increase their influence over the towns in the areas where they operate			1
not only do they traffic in drugs , but cartels have diversified into human smuggling , extortion , and even into public works			2
a typical drug trafficking organization has a network of lookouts on city streets , " tax " collectors who collect protection money , and hit men who enforce their will on populations			1
the result has been situations where the duties of mayors -- to collect taxes , provide security , and carry out public works -- have butted against the interests of the cartels , oftentimes with fatal results			1
thirteen mayors have been killed so far this year in @entity5 , in states around the country			1
the killings represent just a fraction of all the mayors throughout the country , but illustrate a disturbing new development in the drug war			1
the turf wars that the cartels are fighting are reflected in the office of the mayor , said @entity58 , a television and radio political commentator in @entity61			2
" these groups are demanding more from the mayors , " @entity58 told @entity0			1
the cartels seek information , police protection and means of communication from the local governments , she said , adding that she was surprised that more mayors have not been killed			1
this year , the largest number of mayors -- four -- have been killed in the border state of @entity74 , a hotbed of fighting between the @entity78 cartel and the @entity79			1
killings have also been recorded in hot spots such as the state of @entity83 , home to the @entity85 cartel			1
also affected have been @entity86 and @entity87 , two border states where the @entity90 drug cartel is battling an alliance comprised of the @entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity95 cartel			1
@entity96 , a @entity5 expert and professor of government at the @entity99 , said that he sees the @entity90 , who got their start as army defectors , as a force behind some of the killings			1
the @entity90 have been on the defensive against the alliance that formed against them , as well as from the government forces			2
" they are trying to demonstrate they are still important players , " @entity96 said			0
" they want to regain the reputation they think they have lost as the most ruthless organization in the @entity117			0
" while the @entity90 are not known for doing public works , some of their illicit activities -- collecting money for protection , for example -- shadow the responsibilities of the local government			0
" you are expected at least to turn a blind eye , if you are a mayor , especially , " @entity96 told @entity0			0
most of the violence against mayors has happened in small towns in drug cartel territory , where the leaders are more vulnerable than their big - city counterparts			1
one example is the small border town of @entity137 , known locally simply as @entity137 , in @entity74			1
a year ago this month , the mayor , @entity138 , was kidnapped and then found executed			1
@entity137 , located across the border from @entity140 , @entity5 , literally scrapes along the border with the @entity142			1
as a town , it is known as a staging area for immigrants looking to steal across the border , and lacks an industry of its own			0
" it 's been a difficult challenge , " @entity150 , the current mayor of @entity137 , said of her position			0
but since that killing , things have been relatively calm			0
" i have not had any problems , thank @entity157 , " she told @entity0			0
at first , she says that she was not scared when she succeeded @entity138			0
then , she restated her answer			0
" i first i was scared , why should i lie ? but not anymore " no drug traffickers have come to negotiate with her on any issues , she said			1
@entity161 says she does n't know who killed @entity138 , though speculation is that it was one of the cartels that work in the area			1
i do n't know what is behind it , " she said			0
@entity138 had been in a quarrel with local teachers at the time of his death , but she does n't think they were the ones who ended his life			0
other killings offer more clear evidence of cartel involvement			1
in september , in the town of @entity184 in @entity185 , witnesses saw four armed and hooded men exit a white truck in front of city hall in the early afternoon			0
two men waited in front of the building while the other two went inside mayor @entity161 's office and shot him			0
other killings have been even more violent			0
the mayor of @entity196 , @entity83 -- @entity197 -- was found stoned to death on the side of the road			0
an aide who was with him met the same fate			0
being a mayor in @entity5 these days requires great courage because they face intimidation , threats and bribes , mayor @entity210 of @entity211 , @entity74 , told @entity0			1
" as mayors we are under a lot of risk , " he said			2
@entity210 says that he tries to focus on his job , helping the people of his community with infrastructure and water projects in his agricultural town			0
the only crime he is concerned with are local ones , such as robbery and domestic violence			2
drug trafficking and murders fall to the state and federal authorities to investigate			2
" our job is to work closely with the community , " he said			2
" i feel safe , i feel secure			0
" still , he wishes for more federal and state help for issues such as social development and security			0
" in a way , this ( violence ) was expected , " @entity58 said , referring to how cartels continue to push the limit to who they can kill			2
before the mayors were targeted , cartels had been targeting police chiefs throughout the country			2
" i think the death toll will rise with the mayors			2
" could governors be next ? a leading gubernatorial candidate in @entity86 state , @entity254 , was gunned down in june .			0

thirteen mayors have been killed in @entity5 this year
most are from small towns where they are more vulnerable
drug cartel operations sometimes clash with the work of mayors
the violence against them could increase , *analysts* say
