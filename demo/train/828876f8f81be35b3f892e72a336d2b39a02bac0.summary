-- they left the field with their heads bowed			2
looks of shock , anguish , disbelief spread like wildfire			2
as @entity16 's players walked off the turf at @entity18 , the remnants of their title challenge were left in tatters			1
in the space of nine second half minutes , @entity16 's hopes of winning a first league crown in 24 years were obliterated by a @entity24 side which continues to produce wonders			1
leading 3 - 0 courtesy of goals from @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity16 appeared perfectly set to take the title race down to the final day of the season			1
but @entity24 hit back in style -- scoring three dramatic , late goals to snatch a point and leave @entity36 in pole position to win its second @entity39 crown			1
" it is 99 goals we have scored , which is a phenomenal achievement by the team -- but you have to defend , " @entity16 manager @entity40 told the @entity41			1
" it is no good scoring all those goals if you defend as we did tonight			2
" there is no doubt			0
@entity36 will go on and win it			1
we needed to win to keep the pressure on going into the last game and we did not do that			2
" you have to have that maturity to see it through and we did not do that			0
it was bitterly disappointing and i would expect @entity36 to go on and win their two home games			1
" congratulations to @entity24 , they produced a great fightback and punished our mistakes			1
" with 78 minutes of the contest having elapsed , @entity16 led 3 - 0 and was cruising to the top of the @entity39 and a three point advantage			1
@entity24 , a revelation under manager @entity72 , had rarely threatened and appeared to have run out of steam			1
but what followed would have shocked even the most seasoned of football supporters as @entity16 imploded			1
this was carnage -- carnage which would have been greeted with glee by those in the blue half of @entity81			0
first , with 11 minutes remaining , @entity83 's deflected drive reduced the deficit			0
merely a consolation , or so one thought			0
two minutes later and @entity24 scored another , substitute @entity88 firing home from 10 - yards to reduce the arrears further			1
@entity16 , whose defense has been fiercely criticized so often this season , appeared dazed and confused as if it had been hit with a right hook from a heavyweight boxer			1
and with just two minutes of normal time remaining , @entity88 lashed home an unlikely equalizer to break @entity16 hearts			1
" it was obviously very frustrating , " added @entity40			0
" for 75 minutes we were outstanding			0
we scored three goals , we created many chances , then we conceded with 12 minutes to go and we have to see the game out better than that			0
" you can not come here against a very good side , be the threat that we were and then defend as we did			0
" it is the fault of the team , coach , manager , everyone			0
we win and lose together			2
the supporters were brilliant for us			0
they helped us get in front but we ended up conceding three goals in the last 12 minutes			0
we win and lose together , so we will take the blame and move on			2
" it had been inconceivable that @entity16 would fail in such spectacular fashion following their impressive start to the second half			1
leading through @entity28 's first half header , @entity29 's deflected effort gave the visiting side a two - goal cushion before @entity30 added a third in the 55th minute			2
it looked as if @entity16 would simply continue to score at will , gradually chipping away at @entity36 's superior goal difference			1
that it did n't owed much to the team 's poor defending as much as @entity24 's grit and determination			2
this result will surely allow @entity36 to take the crown -- but @entity40 is not giving up just yet			2
he added : " we go top tonight as well , with 81 points with a week to go in the season and we are sat here devastated			0
" we finished seventh last season			0
we are ahead of schedule			0
we have made great strides but i am certainly here to fight and win titles and i will be relentless in that			2
" we are trying to build something sustainable			0
this season has shown we will be capable of doing that			0
next year i believe we will make more strides forward and hopefully be up there challenging again			0
" @entity16 must now wait and see how @entity36 gets on against @entity152 on wednesday night			1
@entity40 ' side lead the table by one point but has played a game more			0
victory for @entity36 would leave it requiring victory in its final home game against @entity161 to seal the title			1
@entity164 triumph meanwhile , in @entity166 , champion @entity164 celebrated winning the title with a 1 - 0 victory over @entity169			1
@entity171 's 72nd minute strike was enough to give the home side all three points			0
in the night 's other game , @entity174 was held to a 3 - 3 draw by @entity177 .			1

@entity16 held 3 - 3 by @entity24 at @entity18
@entity16 led 3 - 0 before @entity24 fought back
@entity36 now in pole position to win title
