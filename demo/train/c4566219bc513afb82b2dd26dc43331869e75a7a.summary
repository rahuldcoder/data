-- @entity1 deserves a ban from baseball more than any sympathy			1
it is sad to hear his quavery confession of a career filled with steroids , his sorrow over the pain it caused his family and fans , his revelation of a life of lies that burned inside him like a hidden disease and consumed the game he loved			2
but for those of us who also love baseball , the damage he did was too deep and his further threat to the integrity of the game is too great to justify his return			1
@entity1 's entire playing career is indelibly stained and his judgment is not to be trusted			1
what else are we to make of a man who cheated and did n't come clean for 20 years ? can he be trusted to coach other players who may be using steroids ? is he fit for any job that is also a test of character and personal standards ? @entity40 should bar him from coaching and never again allow his name on a @entity44 ballot			1
@entity46 manager @entity45 , @entity1 's longtime apologist , is leading the charge to rehabilitate him in his new role as the @entity50 ' batting coach , saying monday 's admission and expression of regret is worthy of respect			1
this from a manager who either closed his eyes to drug use on his teams , did n't know what he should have known , or kept conspiratorially silent about it through all the years with @entity1 on the @entity62 ( along with @entity63 ) and on the @entity64			1
so , too , with commissioner @entity65 and the @entity50 ' general manager and the players who would like to see the whole cancer of steroids in baseball vanish in a wash of tears and belated contrition			1
a mea culpa does n't undo the enormous harm that @entity1 and his pumped - up colleagues inflicted on baseball -- worse than all the gambling that has kept @entity78 out of the @entity44 and from returning to the game			1
@entity80 : time to forgive @entity1 @entity1 chose the wrong path years ago and stayed on it -- making the mistake of all public figures who try to stonewall their way out of trouble , from @entity88 to @entity89			2
in the end , everybody knows and many will forgive , but the guilty have to live with the consequences of their transgressions			0
when i saw the then - legal steroid androstenedione in his locker and reported it during his glorious , now - bittersweet , 70 - homer summer of ' 98 , his first instinct was to deny it			0
pressed , he admitted using it for more than a year and defended it			0
he lied about juicing up on more potent steroids and human growth hormone			2
now he wants to put behind him the past he famously refused to talk about with @entity107 when he was called to testify in 2005			0
he says it was hard to tell the truth to his family , but it 's difficult to believe even that			0
one of his brothers had already revealed it			0
did n't those close to him suspect what everyone else did as they watched him balloon into a freakish hulk during his career ? for two decades -- from the time @entity1 now says he started using performance - enhancers , through his retirement in 2001 and self - imposed exile -- he cheated , covered up and remained ignobly quiet while others were exposed , prosecuted and punished			1
he put the " code of the clubhouse " above the truth in not speaking out about his and others ' drug use years ago , at a time when he might have stopped a generation of young athletes from emulating his physique or gaining his advantages			0
he put legal consequences ahead of baseball 's reputation when he dodged questions from congressmen because he was n't granted immunity			1
could he be trusted to do the right thing if he comes across another player on drugs ? he 's a compromised man			2
he still has n't detailed all the drugs he used and where he got them , though his much - scorned former bash brother , @entity63 , seems to have been the bearer of a fair amount of truth all along , no matter how self - serving or uncomfortable his revelations were to baseball			1
why @entity1 does n't get it @entity1 explains away all his drug use by saying it was mainly to help him recover from injuries , not just to power him up to hit home runs			1
he argues that steroids and human growth hormone alone did n't make him a great slugger , saying that he had good and bad years when he was juiced , just as he had good years , such as his record - setting rookie season , when he claims he was n't chemically enhanced			2
he trots out the fact that he always worked hard , on and off the field , and that he had @entity164 - given talent			0
i believe him about all that , though no one should excuse him for it , as he seems to wish			0
but i believe , too , he became addicted to his strength , his size , the power it gave him , the high arc of his homers , even if he always felt awkward in the spotlight			0
ireporter : @entity1 's " ball most foul " anabolic steroids and other performance - enhancing drugs wo n't give a player the kind of hand - eye coordination , the skills , the quick , sweet swing that @entity1 had that enabled him to launch so many balls so far			1
and he would n't have gotten so big , even with hundreds of injections , if he had n't pumped iron day after day			0
sure , he put in the work in the gym , and , sure , he put in the hours at batting practice			0
but the drugs are what helped him put in those hours , enabled him to recover more quickly from workout to workout , to maintain a higher level of lean musculature and energy than those who played it straight			0
they were his shortcut to greatness at the plate			2
if @entity1 's admissions can serve any good now , it would be to prompt other steroid users to come clean			1
confession is not only good for the soul , it would be very good for the game to get it all out now , once and for all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

@entity215 broke the story of @entity1 's use of the drug andro
@entity215 says it 's too late to excuse @entity1 for damage he did to baseball
@entity215 says the drugs did n't give @entity1 his swing and coordination
but he says steroids did give @entity1 a shortcut to greatness
