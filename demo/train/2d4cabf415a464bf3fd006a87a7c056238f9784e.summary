-- okay , you 've decided what model of car you want to buy			1
and you know , more or less , how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford			2
you 've kicked tires , talked to salesmen , taken a few shiny new numbers for a test - drive and you 're ready to make the deal			2
if you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections			1
except , you 're not quite done			2
you still need to decide whether to buy any of those " extras " that your salesperson will always suggest			2
some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding			2
others ... maybe not so much			0
the list of " extras " offered by most dealers , may include paint sealant , fabric protection / leather care , extended warranties , extended ' one price ' service contracts , rust / underbody coatings and anti-theft systems , to mention a few			1
we wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without			1
to get to the bottom of it , we thought we would consult an expert -- @entity36 , manager of @entity37			0
as it turns out , like most things in life , the answer often just comes down to what 's best for you , depending on your own situation , budget or locale			0
let 's address these add - ons one by one : paint sealant " i think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days , so in most cases you probably do n't need that anymore , " said @entity36 , who offered one caveat			1
" but that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is , whether you get a lot of snow and ice , and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt , or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint			0
but generally , as long as you keep your car washed , and wash that salt off of it , and get it waxed regularly , that paint should last without getting the ' add - on ' sealer at the dealership			1
also , if you get a chip or a ding , get it fixed so the rust does n't get a chance to set in and spread			1
" fabric / leather protection these extras are fairly self - explanatory -- the dealer " treats " the upholstered or leather seating with a " protection " product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks			1
" this can be a good purchase , but the first question you should ask before buying it is , ' what kind of lifestyle do i lead ? ' suggests @entity36			0
" do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things ? or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults ? " do you eat in the car with some regularity ? if so , and you 're just too darn messy for your own good , a stain protection might be a good way to go			1
" also , look at exclusions in the plan , " advises @entity36			1
" if you 're a smoker , and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes , and you 're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short , that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion			0
each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different , and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase , because it might not be a good one for you			1
" if you want to save some cash , one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner			1
to remove spots from a leather seat , use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth			0
if the spot still remains , let it sit for a few hours			0
repeat , as they say , if necessary			0
it 's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance			0
@entity148 this is when the dealership applies various rust - inhibiting chemicals , waxes or sealers to the vehicle 's undercarriage			0
it can also be applied to other rust - prone areas			0
rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years			0
keep in mind that some guarantees require annual " checkups " to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged			0
" i do n't think this is necessary in most cases , " opines @entity36			2
" the way most vehicles are constructed today , they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north , where they get a lot of snow			0
" @entity180 / anti-theft systems : the folks at @entity183 report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the @entity185 using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle			1
but if you want to go the more high - tech " tracking " route , using a security system like @entity183 may give you more peace of mind			1
the @entity194 , includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle			0
@entity197 uses a code that is tied into the @entity199 ( @entity199 )			0
then , when you report that your car has been stolen , the state police crime computer can match code against the state vin database			2
this automatically activates the @entity194 in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal			0
then , police cruisers and aviation units that have the @entity183 tracking system can identify the vehicle 's location , track it and recover it			1
@entity183 claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system , with over 100,000 of those in the @entity185 " whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors			1
if you live in a high - crime area , a system like this could provide you with peace of mind , " advises @entity36			0
" but even if you live in a safe , low - crime district , your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage , " he notes			2
one caveat : some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen , especially if it has been seriously vandalized , or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems			1
another thing to consider is that owners of @entity237 vehicles that come with its patented @entity240 system , probably wo n't need a theft tracking program , says @entity36			1
" because the system allows @entity240 operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen			1
so if you buy a @entity237 car with the @entity240 system , you may want to pass on a @entity183 or similar tracking system			1
" extended warranties " this really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle , because most of these extended warranty plans do n't kick in until the manufacturer 's warranty expires , " advises @entity36			1
" and these days , those manufacturers warranties are three or five years , sometimes longer			2
" so if you plan on selling the car after three or five years , it probably does n't make sense to buy the extended warranty			1
" some warranties offer transferable policies , which let you " sell " the warranty along with the vehicle			1
others allow you to " return " the warranty for a pro-rated refund			0
@entity36 also explains that not all warranties are created equal			2
" they usually have three levels of warranties : a basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain , for example ; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an ' exclusionary ' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed			2
at the top end , the best warranty just covers everything , but that is also the most expensive			0
" @entity36 gives an example of one manufacturers warranty			0
" for a 2007 @entity286 , the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage , and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles			0
in fact , that 's the same warranty @entity237 offers on their @entity292 and @entity293 brands			1
" " that 's a pretty good warranty , so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less , the extended warranty is probably money you do n't need to spend			2
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity237 owners wo n't need @entity183 because cars come with @entity240 option
smokers considering fabric protection should check for policy exclusions
but generally , as long as you keep your car washed you do n't need sealant
some warranties offer transferable policies that let you " sell " it with car
