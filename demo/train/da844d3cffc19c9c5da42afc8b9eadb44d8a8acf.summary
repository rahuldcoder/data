if @entity3 intelligence did n't do it , then sen. @entity1 's legal team has a list of other theories about who was behind a prostitution smear that surfaced in 2012 as the powerful senator ran for re-election			1
an april letter to the @entity12 lists a litany of possible conspiracies -- in addition to the @entity3 spy caper -- behind the mysterious tip that alleged the @entity19 @entity18 was a sex tourist who flew to the @entity20 to meet underage prostitutes			1
the letter from @entity24 attorney @entity23 to the @entity12 's public integrity section asks the department to investigate possible " criminal activity intended " to unseat him " and to prevent him from becoming chairman " of the @entity31			1
" public integrity prosecutors are leading a corruption probe of whether @entity1 violated the law in advocating for campaign donors			1
@entity23 declined to make his letter public			0
but @entity37 reviewed a copy of it and verified its contents with three sources who have seen it			1
@entity3 intelligence the letter begins by raising the allegation , sourced to an unnamed " senior government official , " that @entity3 intelligence agents may have been behind the smear campaign			0
but @entity23 's letter also suggests the possibility of a conspiracy either -- knowingly or unknowingly -- between @entity3 intelligence and @entity53 enemies of the senator			0
among the other theories : that a former @entity57 ambassador with a beef against @entity1 was the tipster who called himself " @entity66 " and who shopped the prostitution story to news outlets in @entity63 , a government watchdog group and to the @entity65			1
@entity19 politics another more complicated theory offered in the letter , citing an unnamed witness : that @entity53 operative @entity71 offered the story to the conservative news outlet @entity74 , which refused to publish it			0
the same witness allegedly claimed that @entity71 had a goal in mind -- to ensure gov. @entity79 could appoint @entity1 's interim successor in the event he had to resign			1
" @entity79 is my ultimate client , " the letter says the witness quoted @entity71 as saying			0
@entity23 suggests ties to other @entity19 political figures who would want to help sink @entity1 's campaign and notes : " governor @entity79 's connection to the fraud can be explained from a motive standpoint			1
" the letter makes no allegation that the governor was part of or even knew of the smear campaign			0
@entity71 denied the allegations in a telephone interview with @entity37 and called them " patently false			1
" @entity57 officials familiar with the matter told @entity37 earlier this week that the government was aware of the @entity3 espionage allegations and had found no evidence to support it			2
the @entity3 government - run website also dismissed any ties to @entity3			0
corruption probe the @entity65 's foray into the prostitution allegations dovetailed with a federal investigation focused on a @entity1 donor in @entity111 , who for years has fought allegations that he overbilled @entity114			1
investigators soon began looking into @entity1 's relationship with the donor			2
@entity1 's legal team believes the false prostitution story taints the entire investigation of the senator and wants it looked into further to see where it came from			1
" this entire matter began with a campaign of lies to smear senator @entity1 to affect his election and the chairmanship of the @entity128 , and those lies included a fraud against the government , " @entity23 said in a statement			2
" the @entity12 has the responsibility to investigate who committed that crime , so when i have received from credible sources information that merited further review , i have sent it to them			2
we do n't know who was responsible for the smear against senator @entity1 , but it is my hope that the @entity12 will demonstrate some urgency in getting to the bottom of it			1
" whoever perpetuated this fraud against the government to smear a @entity149 and potentially influence @entity57 policy should be held accountable to the full extent of the law , " he added			0
@entity1 weighs in @entity1 told @entity37 earlier this week that the @entity3 intelligence involvement was plausible			1
" well , let 's put it this way , for 22 years , between the @entity157 and the @entity128 , i have had a firm position in opposition to the @entity3 regime that violates the human rights - the democracy of the people of @entity3 , " he said			0
" i have been outspoken in that regard			0
and i would n't be surprised that the regime would do anything it can to stop me from being in a position that ultimately would impede their hopes of being able to get a different relationship with the @entity57 based upon their interests , but not the interests of the @entity3 people , " he added			0
important development additional content from the lawyer 's letter matters because it casts new light on the @entity1 legal team 's efforts to force the government to reexamine the beginnings of their ongoing probe of the senator			1
the variety of theories offered -- and lack of proof to back them up -- does n't indicate @entity1 's legal team knows what gave rise to the prostitution story			2
another letter @entity23 sent to prosecutors in january did n't mention the theories			0
the april letter came at a time when the @entity1 probe was intensifying , with investigators using a grand jury to issue subpoenas , according to people familiar with the probe			1
any possible charges are n't imminent , according to these people			0
should charges ever be brought against @entity1 , @entity23 's letter offers a glimpse of at least part of the defense team 's possible strategy			1
by raising questions about the beginnings of the @entity65 probe , the defense could attempt to put the government 's own investigation on trial			1
the letter also shows how a well - funded defense can try to complicate criminal investigations			0
it 's common for @entity65 investigations to begin with dead ends before finding a viable prosecutable crime			2
but most defendants do n't have money to pay for lawyers who can expose those dead ends , and try to make them a liability for prosecutors			0
the tipster , media coverage the episode began in april 2012 when a tipster calling himself " @entity66 " emailed the @entity236 , a watchdog group , offering to supply evidence that @entity1 was involved with underage prostitutes			1
@entity236 shared the information with the @entity65			2
an @entity65 agent in @entity241 exchanged emails with the purported tipster , but the tipster appeared evasive in emails and would never agree to meet or talk with the @entity65 agent			2
after months of investigating , the @entity65 decided there was n't any merit to the allegation			2
reporters at several news organizations in @entity63 also looked into the allegations , also after receiving emails from a purported tipster , but did n't publish a story			0
then in november 2013 , the @entity256 , a conservative website , ran with the story			0
by early 2013 the story began falling apart , and the alleged prostitutes who had claimed to be involved recanted their story			0
@entity1 , who is of @entity3 descent , won reelection and is now chairman of the @entity31 panel , which has given him a perch from which to thwart any @entity266 administration plans to relax economic sanctions to improve ties with the island 's communist regime			0
for good measure , @entity23 offers one more suggestion to the @entity12 : that a combination of @entity3 intelligence tricksters and @entity57 political enemies were behind the smear			0
he writes : " we encourage the department to show some sense of outrage that a foreign intelligence agency operated by a government that has every reason to harm senator @entity1 to the @entity57 has combined with dirty tricks political operatives to successfully use the @entity12 to accomplish its goals			1

first on @entity37 : possible conspiracies listed in letter to @entity12
sen. @entity1 was accused of *cavorting* with prostitutes in the @entity20
the alleges surfaced as he ran for re-election , but later *discredited* by the @entity65
however , federal authorities have launched a federal corruption investigation
