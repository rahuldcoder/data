-- @entity1 's a big place			1
it sounds obvious , but it 's an important fact to remember when planning a visit , because you wo n't get to see everything in one trip			1
i spent the first 24 years of my life in four different @entity1 towns , and there are still new things to do when i go back to visit			1
so tip no. 1 is to make some decisions : do you want to camp in a national park ? hike to the top of a glacier ? go backcountry skiing ? catch and / or eat some of the best seafood in the country ? see the northern lights ? you wo n't be able to do it all , but with a bit of planning you can pack quite a few adventures into a week or two			2
here are some ideas for activities based on a recent trip i took with some friends : as the state 's largest city and home to its biggest airport , @entity34 is the place where many will start their adventures on the @entity1 -- and our trip was no different			1
the city is surrounded by water on two sides and a mountain range on the third			2
at sea level , the @entity48 skirts the city along the water			2
it 's an 11 - mile paved trail available for walking and cycling , or skiing and snowshoeing , depending on the season			1
for those looking for more elevation , @entity57 is just east of the city and has several trails			1
i recommend heading up @entity62			2
it 's a relatively short hike , just 1.5 miles from the trailhead to the mountain top , but the trail is steep in parts , especially near the summit			2
with a bit of care , though , most people should n't have too much trouble making it up and enjoying the sweeping view of the city and surrounding scenery			0
on our trip , we left @entity34 after a couple of days and drove 130 miles south to @entity79			1
from there , we spent a day hiking alongside @entity82 in @entity83			0
the @entity84 calls this 7.4 - mile hike " strenuous , " but seeing the ice field at the top makes the hard work worthwhile			0
and it does n't get much better than an @entity1 @entity91 beer and fresh halibut once you make it back down			1
if your legs are tired from hiking , you can work out your arms with a sea kayaking trip in @entity99			0
the clouds were low the day of our excursion , but we saw bald eagles in the tree tops and were escorted by sea lions as we paddled along the rocky shoreline			0
to finish off our @entity1 adventure , we left @entity79 and drove 360 miles up to @entity108 , home of the tallest peak in @entity110 , @entity111			1
the public is allowed to drive only a few miles into the park , but there are buses that provide access farther into the wilderness			0
on our bus ride we saw bears , mountain goats , moose and coyotes			0
a few lucky visitors will get to see wolves , but sightings are rare			0
after a few nights of camping in the park , it was time to drive back to @entity34 and catch our flights home			1
and even though we experienced a lot during our visit , there are plenty more adventures to be had when we go back			0
like fishing for king salmon on the @entity136 , or watching the northern lights while relaxing in natural hot springs , or downhill skiing in @entity140 , or sailing along the @entity142 , or panning for gold in the @entity144 , or ...			0
