-- faster than you can catch the red - eye from @entity6 to @entity7 , the world 's airlines have to keep evolving in order to stay resilient in the global world of commercial aviation			1
with 8 million passengers taking a plane each day , the 3 billion journeys made last year are more than just a flight for many			2
they are the hopes and dreams of deals to be done , families to be reunited and ambitions to be realized			0
the first commercial flight 100 years ago was a 23 - minute journey in a flying boat across @entity23 , @entity24 in 1914			1
the mayor of @entity26 , @entity24 , at that time paid $ 400 -- about $ 9,000 today -- to become the world 's first paying passenger			1
since the birth of commercial aviation the airline industry has been characterized by the concept of risk versus reward , with some of the best - known names failing , many merging and consolidating along the way			2
@entity38 was one of the first to blaze a trail across the @entity41 with its spacious cabins , ladies - only powder rooms and modest overhead lights			0
but even for @entity47 it was n't enough to keep the company financially astute			0
" these names have gone , the @entity57 and the @entity58 and others , but of course their businesses went into other businesses , and that tells us that consolidation is the way forward in this industry , " @entity49 , ceo of @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , told @entity0 's @entity51 at the group 's 70th agm in @entity54 , @entity55			1
the industry has suffered as much turbulence in the pocket as it has in the air , and @entity71 is another example of risk versus reward			0
after its recent bankruptcy , it was the last major @entity75 carrier to merge , with @entity75 airways			0
there 's no better example of risk and reward than the @entity81 , the @entity82			2
the world 's first wide - bodied , double decker plane , it was built by @entity81 in the 1960s , which literally bet the company on the plane 's success			2
according to @entity49 , a key to success in the future is sticking to a global mindset			0
" the point is this is a global industry , it 's become global over the last 100 years , " he told @entity94			1
" we are the industry that makes global possible and what that means is that everyone in it needs to understand they are part of a global network			0
they 're part of a global system and they need to think globally in everything they do			0
" while today 's airplanes are a century away from that flying boat that crossed @entity23 , there 's no doubt that the risk and reward still remain just as high as they did 100 years ago			1
timeline : 100 years of commercial aviation			1

the first commercial flight took place 100 years ago in @entity23 , @entity24
since then , many airlines have been consolidating
today 's airlines must be global in every way in order to survive , says @entity50 chief
