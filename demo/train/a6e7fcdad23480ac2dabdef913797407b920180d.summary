@entity30 's government , for its part , kept up the war of words			2
state - run @entity1 tv late wednesday quoted a military source as saying a " civilian location was shelled tonight in the city of @entity37 by the colonizing crusader aggression			1
" amid debate on whether the allies will arm the retreating and undertrained rebels , a @entity21 intelligence source told @entity2 the @entity4 is in the country to increase the " military and political understanding " of the situation			1

" i will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in @entity1 , " said @entity51 press secretary @entity58 in a statement			1
" we 're not ruling it out or ruling it in			2
we 're assessing and reviewing options for all types of assistance that we could provide to the @entity1 people , and have consulted directly with the opposition and our international partners about these matters			1

@entity2 's @entity134 , who has been reporting from @entity1 for several weeks , said that @entity131 's departure is a significant blow , but not a critical loss to the regime			1
a @entity127 spokesperson said @entity131 was one of the most senior figures in @entity30 's government " and his role was to represent the regime internationally -- something that he is no longer willing to do			0
" the department provided no other details on the surprise move			0
@entity2 's @entity148 , who previously met with @entity131 , said the former head of intelligence once was a stalwart defender of the government			0

they have been pushed eastward over the last two days after @entity2 reported on sunday that rebels took @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 and reached a town just east of @entity175			0
rebel forces have now lost @entity173 and the key oil town of @entity172 and are backed up to the @entity171 area , @entity163 said			0

in the outskirts of @entity179 -- which was recently taken over by opposition forces -- @entity30 's regime planted several dozen land mines , @entity225 said in a statement wednesday			2
