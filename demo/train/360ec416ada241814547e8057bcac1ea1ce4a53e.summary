-- many angry @entity1 are urging a punishment on @entity3 in the killing of @entity5 : a boycott			1
musician @entity7 wo n't perform there			0
@entity9 is considering deploying the tactic -- often used by his famous father in the civil rights era -- against @entity3 products like orange juice			1
social media activists advance boycott plans even on the state 's official tourism page on @entity19			1
their actions seek the repeal of @entity3 's " stand your ground " self - defense law , which was at the center of a national debate in the wake of @entity5 's shooting death			1
@entity30 's lawyers did n't invoke @entity3 's " stand your ground " law in court , but it was included in the instructions to the jury that acquitted him			1
but will a boycott work ? and when are they effective ? ' @entity41 ' laws up to states , not @entity39 or @entity43 the win column is spotty for boycotts against controversial state laws , experts say			1
the matter becomes further complicated by the fact that more than 20 states -- not just @entity3 -- have such a law			1
" for boycott organizers , it 's more difficult with a state , " said @entity52 , a professor at @entity54 's @entity53			2
" let 's say your goal is to change a particular law , " he continued			2
" if you think about a political process , you could have multiple chambers and a governor			0
the political process is much slower and messier than a corporate decision process			0
" one example of success -- at least economically , one group says -- is the recent boycott of @entity71 for its immigration laws			1
@entity80 to the @entity3 " stand your ground " law , the @entity71 immigration law " triggered a fierce , national public - opinion backlash against the state and led many national organizations and opinion leaders to call for economic boycotts , " said a 2010 report by the left - leaning @entity74			1
@entity71 lost at least $ 141 million after groups canceled their conventions there , according to estimates in the 2010 study			1
" this report provides a clear window into the potentially catastrophic impacts of pursuing harsh , state - based immigration policies , " the center said			2
but other analysts point out how @entity71 did n't change its immigration laws , despite the boycott			1
it took the @entity1 @entity96 to do that , in a decision last year striking down key parts of the state law that sought to deter illegal immigration			1
" it did n't impact the state in such a manner that people considered changing the rules and regulations , so all of this was done with very little positive results , " said @entity102 , a tourism professor and dean of the hospitality management college at the @entity105 in @entity106 , which is also home to @entity108			2
protesters stand up to ' stand your ground , ' but laws likely here to stay but the center said the boycott did send a warning : " other states considering immigration legislation should pause before rushing to adopt measures like ( the @entity71 law ) @entity129 and understand the potentially disastrous economic and fiscal consequences of such a decision			1
" in general , boycotts have three functions : to cause economic damage , to keep a spotlight on public issues and to achieve a stated objective , @entity52 says			2
while boycotts can be effective in the first two aims , the third goal can be murky			0
" do they accomplish the objective ? there , the record is spotty , " @entity52 said			2
" they are driven by outrage and anger , but they ( sometimes ) do n't have a clearly specified objective			0
" the occupy movement in 2011 had such results : " they never accomplished a specific objective			0
it was more of a channel for outrage , " he said			0
among the better - known cases of boycotts producing major political change is in the apartheid era of @entity161 , when many nations imposed an economic and cultural boycott so intense that the country became an international pariah			2
the boycott lasted several years			0
finally , under the international pressure , @entity161 ended apartheid , the system of legalized racial segregation			0
that was more than 20 years ago			0
" many said that ( boycott ) had an effect , but it lasted a long time , and it was supported by a large number of countries , and it was supported by the vast population , " @entity102 said			2
" that 's a different situation than we have now " with " stand your ground " laws , @entity102 added			1
" there are people in @entity3 -- i know some of my colleagues -- who feel the ' stand your ground ' law is the right thing to do in @entity3 , so you do n't have 100 % support " for a boycott , he said			1
in addition to needing widespread support , a boycott would have to offer consumers easy alternatives			0
for example , can @entity1 easily cancel their family vacation to @entity106 's @entity108 ? can they easily find a substitute for their favorite @entity3 orange juice brand , especially when growers say they had nothing to do with the jury 's acquittal of @entity30 ? " for a boycott to be successful , we have to ask people to do things against their economic interests , " said @entity206 , a professor at the @entity207			1
" people are going to visit @entity108 or not			0
they are going to visit @entity213 or not			0
" boycotts require a commitment , such as when the rev. @entity217 led a successful boycott against buses and other public transportation in @entity221 , @entity222 , in the 1950s as part of the civil rights movement , experts said			1
a clear and simple goal must be present , with " a protracted feeling of outrage , " @entity102 said			0
the sliding scales of self - defense remember how @entity1 boycotted @entity231 wine after @entity231 declined to join a @entity1 - led coalition to invade @entity233 in 2003 ? " the feelings that we have today are not the feelings that we 're going to have in six months , " @entity102 said			1
" just as we were upset at @entity231 and might have chosen an @entity238 wine over a @entity231 wine a dozen years ago , i think you would be hard - pressed to find an @entity1 avoiding @entity231 wine			2
" boycotts can backfire , such as when the president of @entity244 provoked a consumer boycott by denouncing same - sex marriage and saying his fast - food chain backs the traditional family unit			1
traditional family supporters , however , organized a counterboycott -- a " buycott " -- and even a " @entity251			0
" " there were some groups that went and actually started frequenting @entity244 more , " @entity206 noted			0
corporate boycotts can yield more immediate results because @entity256 can act faster than elected lawmakers , but the activism requires key ingredients : consumers must care , customers must be able to easily shop elsewhere , issues must be understandable , and the boycott needs mass attention , often enhanced by speedy social media , @entity52 wrote in the @entity266 last year			1
one successful effort was @entity269 's 1995 boycott of @entity270 -- a specific target -- which reduced sales in @entity273 by 40 %			0
the " @entity274 : i 'm hatin ' it " campaign by the @entity280 , however , has had " limited impact " on @entity283 because the issues are " complex and not intuitive , " especially in comparison with the more easily grasped notion of a fur boycott , @entity52 wrote			2
the analysts were pessimistic about a successful @entity3 boycott , even if @entity7 is calling upon fans to avoid doing business in @entity3 and any other state with a " stand your ground " self - defense law			1
@entity9 , the civil rights scion , is also weighing a multistate boycott , such as against @entity295 peaches because that state also has a " stand your ground " law			1
" these are things that my father considered in his era , " @entity9 said			0
but a @entity3 boycott faces overwhelming odds because it lacks an easy target and uses economic pressure to seek political change , experts say			1
moreover , the gambit may even hurt african - americans and other minorities because they often work in the @entity3 's vast tourism industry			2
" business will suffer the least , and employees will suffer the most , " said @entity102 , the @entity3 tourism professor			2
" it 's good - intentioned people who do n't realize the unintended negative consequences that will hurt the ones they want to help			0
" added @entity206 about a @entity3 boycott : " it 's ridiculous			1
it 's an expression of frustration , and i think that frustration is valid			0
" but i do n't think there 's sufficient groundswell to motivate a campaign that a boycott would require , " he continued			0
" for boycotts to be successful , people have to have easy alternatives			0
either you 're going to visit @entity213 , or you 're not			0
and there are n't easy alternatives			0
" juror pushes for new laws following trial			0

boycotting state laws has a spotty record , analyst says
some boycotting @entity1 want @entity3 to repeal its ' stand your ground ' law
@entity71 boycott led to $ 141 million in losses , but experts *dispute* its effect on laws
consumer boycott can succeed if public can easily shop elsewhere , analysts say
