two days after the grisly discovery , the case of the @entity2 hotel water tank corpse is a mystery with many unanswered questions			1
the decomposing body of @entity7 floated inside a water tank on the roof of the @entity10 while guests brushed their teeth , bathed and drank with water from it for as long as 19 days			1
a maintenance worker , checking on complaints about the hotel 's water , found the 21 - year - old @entity22 tourist inside one of four water cisterns tuesday morning , @entity16 sgt. @entity15 said			1
how and where did @entity7 die ? @entity2 robbery - homicide detectives are treating this as a suspicious death for obvious reasons , @entity15 said			1
falling into a covered water tank behind a locked door on top of a roof would be an unusual accident			1
an autopsy was completed , but the cause of death is deferred pending further examination , assistant chief coroner @entity35 said thursday			1
that may take six to eight weeks			2
it will be several weeks before investigators have the toxicology lab report which would show whether @entity44 had any drugs in her system			1
any marks , injuries or wounds may suggest @entity44 died elsewhere and was dumped into the tank by her killer			2
water in @entity44 's lungs could be a sign that she drowned , but it might not tell why she was inside the small tank			1
one clue comes from security camera video of @entity44 inside a hotel elevator the last day she was seen			1
she is seen walking into the elevator , pushing the buttons for four floors and then peering out of the opened elevator door as if she is hiding or looking for someone			2
clad in a red hoodie , @entity44 at one point walks out of the elevator before returning to it , pushing the buttons again			0
she then stands outside the open elevator doorway , motioning with her hands , before apparently walking away			0
@entity44 checked into the @entity10 five days earlier , january 26 , on her way to @entity80 , @entity81 , according to police in her hometown of @entity85 , @entity86			0
why did it it take so long to find @entity44 ? @entity44 's parents reported the @entity90 student missing in early february			0
her daily calls home stopped on january 31 , police told reporters on february 6 at a @entity2 news conference			0
because it was an international case -- and her parents and sister flew to @entity81 to find answers -- the case may have gotten more attention than most of the several thousand missing person reports made in @entity2 each year			1
a search of the hotel then found no sign of @entity44 , including a trip to the roof with a police search dog , @entity15 said			1
strange things began happening with the hotel 's water supply later in the month , according to @entity113 and @entity114 , a @entity86 couple who spent eight days there until checking out wednesday			1
the water pressure dropped to a trickle at times			1
" the shower was awful , " @entity117 said			0
" when you turned the tap on , the water was coming black first for two seconds and then it was going back to normal			1
" the tap water " tasted horrible , " @entity114 said			1
" it had a very funny , sweety , disgusting taste			1
it 's a very strange taste			1
i can barely describe it			0
" but for a week , they never complained			0
" we never thought anything of it , " she said			0
" we thought it was just the way it was here			0
" knowing now what they did n't know then about the water is sickening , @entity114 said			1
" it makes you feel literally physically sick , but more than that you feel it psychologically			0
you think about it and it 's not good			0
" eventually , the hotel maintenance department investigated the water problem , sending a worker to look into the tank , police said			1
he saw @entity44 's lifeless body at the bottom			0
a hard - working family @entity154 , a spokesman for the @entity90 , said @entity44 was registered in a class in august , but was not registered in any classes this year , according to records			1
" unfortunately , we do not have much more to say , other than to extend our deepest sympathies to the family , " said @entity154			0
according to @entity2 police , @entity44 tended to use public transportation			0
@entity162 , manager of a hostel in @entity164 , @entity22 , said @entity44 stayed a week there in early december			1
@entity162 called the young woman friendly and outgoing			2
flowers and signs were left thursday outside the temporarily - closed @entity44 family restaurant in @entity171 , @entity86			0
@entity172 , who works nearby , said she was saddened by the loss and the fact the family did not know what happened to the young woman			2
" they are a hard - working family			0
they immigrated here , " she told @entity181 affiliate @entity179			0
" they 've been in the neighborhood for nine years working			0
... they 're honest people			0
" why did hotel stay open after discovery ? new guests continued to check into the @entity190 in the hours after firefighters removed @entity44 's body from the water tank			1
but each guest was asked to sign a waiver releasing the hotel from liability if they become ill. " you do so at your own risk and peril , " the hotel 's release said			1
guests who already paid for their rooms would not get refunds if they move out , it said			0
@entity181 's repeated calls to the hotel for comment were unreturned wednesday and thursday			2
the @entity2 @entity212 immediately tested the water supply , but told the manager they could stay open as long as they provided bottle water and warned guests not to drink the tap water			2
the results of the testing showed no harmful bacteria in the tank or the pipes , according to @entity224 , director of environmental health for the department			1
chlorine in the city 's water may be the reason it is safe , he said			2
all of the tanks and pipes in the building still must be drained , flushed and sanitized , @entity224 said			0
the water will be retested after that process , which should take several days , he said			2
several guests interviewed by @entity181 on wednesday indicated the hotel management did not tell them about the body in the water supply they had been drinking and bathing in			1
@entity242 learned about it from a @entity181 reporter wednesday morning			0
he decided not to sign the waiver and instead find a new hotel			2
many of its guests are tourists from other countries drawn by the hotel 's billing as a " @entity256 - style " hotel that is the perfect accommodation for " spend - thrifty travelers			2
" but if they take @entity258 's tour bus ride through the neighborhood , they would hear about the @entity190 being the former temporary home to at least two convicted murderers , including " @entity262 " serial killer @entity262			0
@entity262 paid $ 14 a day to stay on the 14th floor during his 1980s killing spree , @entity258 said			0
the @entity10 is " in the heart of the action , allowing our guest to embrace the city and the surrounding areas that make @entity2 famous , " according to the description you 'll hear when you call there and are placed on hold			2
in fact , the hotel is just a few blocks away from the infamous @entity279 district in downtown @entity2 , but 16 miles from the beaches of @entity281 , eight miles from @entity283 's @entity282 and 12 miles from glamorous streets of @entity285 that are prominently featured on the @entity190 's website			2
if you want a reservation at the @entity190 you will have to wait until next month			0
the website said the hotel is " sold out " until march 1			2
after then , you can book a room for $ 65			0
