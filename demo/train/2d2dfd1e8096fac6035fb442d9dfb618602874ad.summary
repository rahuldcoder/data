@entity0 , @entity1 -- dr. @entity2 sees himself as a pioneer			2
where others in the medical community believe injections of human growth hormone should be given to adults in only rare cases , @entity4 believes it is a crucial part of keeping people young and vital			2
dr. @entity2 says the patients requesting @entity15 from him are getting younger and younger			1
@entity4 , who has been practicing anti-aging and holistic medicine for 30 years , says he is now prescribing injections of @entity15 to about one out of every four people he treats at his @entity21 in @entity22			1
" people come here for generally two reasons ; they want to look better , and they want to feel better , " @entity4 says			2
while @entity4 says most of his patients are middle - aged , he 's now getting calls from @entity28 30 - somethings wanting @entity15 and rap artists inquiring about illegal steroids , something he does not offer			1
" they feel that part of being a rap star is looking buff and having big muscles , etc. , so anything they can do to bring themselves to look like that is going to enhance the whole image , " he says			0
@entity15 has been used since the 1950s to help children with growth problems , but it stayed under the radar for other uses until 1990 , when dr. @entity48 reported in the @entity49 that men taking a six - month course of @entity15 reduced their body fat by 14.4 percent while increasing lean muscle mass by 8.8 percent			1
the study included just a dozen men , but it inspired a flood of anti-aging literature touting the benefits of growth hormone , along with countless web sites selling @entity15 creams and sprays			1
endocrinologists say those products , though , are worthless -- the body can use @entity15 only when it 's injected to treat patients with @entity15 , @entity4 says they must be diagnosed with a deficiency of @entity15 , which happens naturally as the body ages			1
" it 's a very important hormone , but it 's not something to be taken in isolation , " he says			0
@entity4 says he prescribes @entity15 to restore normal levels of the hormone and makes it part of a broader long - term treatment program including diet , nutritional supplements , exercise and other hormone replacement			1
@entity80 , a 60 - year - old @entity22 entrepreneur , says five years ago , he was having trouble keeping up with the younger people he was doing business with , so he started treatments , which included hgh injections			2
" my skin tone got a lot better			0
i just felt better , " he says			0
" my eyes got a lot brighter			0
my hearing , i swear , got better			0
" @entity80 says hgh injections , along with a healthy diet , exercise , and supplements has made him feel 10 years younger			0
" i can keep up with people who are a lot younger than me , " he says			0
" i am not trying to set records , i am just trying to stay in the game , i am doing business here			0
" but critics argue that doctors are taking huge risks by administering @entity15 because it has n't been studied extensively long - term and says many of the same benefits can be found in diet and exercise alone			1
" there are serious side effects associated with using growth hormone for these individuals including an elevated risk of cancer , diabetes , " says dr. @entity105 of the @entity106			2
@entity105 , who has studied anti-aging for over 20 years , contends that many of the claims are just false and says that only in the rarest of cases can @entity15 be prescribed legally			1
" it can be prescribed in adults for only two things ; muscle - wasting associated with hiv / aids , which is extremely rare , and for adult growth hormone deficiency , " he says			1
still , celebrities including @entity124 and @entity125 who have openly supported the use of @entity15 , have attracted those just seeking a new lease on life			2
marketers for @entity15 therapies claim it 's become a $ 2 billion - a - year business , thanks in large part to aging baby boomers willing to pay big bucks to emulate the stars whose looks never seem to fade			1
the @entity138 recently reported , citing unnamed sources , that rapper @entity140 and singer @entity141 were among celebrity customers allegedly identified in a @entity144 probe of doctors and pharmacists who illegally prescribe steroids or @entity15			1
the @entity138 report did not suggest there was evidence @entity141 or 50 cent took the drugs			0
@entity141 denies taking any performance enhancing drugs , and @entity140 has not commented			0
neither star is accused of breaking the law			0
