@entity0 , @entity1 -- a federal judge ruled wednesday that the government is liable for illegally wiretapping an @entity5 charity without a valid search warrant			1
the ruling in @entity8 reaffirmed an earlier decision that the warrantless wiretaps conducted on an @entity12 - based @entity5 non-profit organization were illegal			1
in wednesday 's ruling , district judge @entity13 said the government is liable for damages from the illegal wiretapping			1
the @entity18 has designated the @entity12 - based @entity19 as a terrorist organization			0
the group , which has sued the government over alleged warrantless wiretapping , is demanding classified information about the program launched by president @entity27 's administration			2
@entity18 officials have refused to tell the charity 's lawyers whether the group was subjected to presidentially authorized , warrantless , foreign intelligence surveillance in 2004 and , if so , what information was obtained			2
the @entity18 stance originated under the @entity27 administration in what is called the " state secrets " defense , which allows courts to block lawsuits against the government on grounds that the litigation could harm national security			2
under @entity27 , the government refused to turn over any classified evidence			0
attorney general @entity48 , appointed when president @entity49 took office in january 2009 , has so far maintained the state secrets defense in the @entity19 case , but indicated a willingness to consider sharing information with judges in certain cases			0
" an additional review was conducted at the highest levels of the @entity61 to determine whether continued invocation of the privilege was warranted , " the government told the court last may			1
" based on that review , it is the government 's position that disclosure of classified information ... would create intolerable risks to national security			2
" @entity13 's ruling wednesday rejected that defense , saying that for the purposes of the case , the court decided there was no warrant for the wiretaps because the government refused to confirm one existed			1
" defendants have foregone multiple opportunities to show that a warrant existed , including specifically rejecting the method created by @entity85 for this very purpose , " the ruling said			0
@entity61 spokeswoman @entity87 said the ruling was under review			1
@entity87 noted that the @entity49 administration policy on the state secrets defense has changed so that it is " narrowly tailored			0
" the government , which has previously appealed rulings against it in the case , has 45 days to notify the court if it intends to file an appeal this time			0
in 2007 the 9th @entity98 overturned a ruling by @entity13 in the same case in which he had rejected the government 's state secrets privilege			1
the ruling , however , left unanswered whether applicable laws could pre-empt the state secrets privilege , so @entity19 went back to court to continue the fight on that issue			0
