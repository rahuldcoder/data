-- a fledgling force of @entity3 military deserters said it struck an important government security complex on the outskirts of the capital overnight , a bold strike reflecting the resolve and confidence of the regime 's opposition			1
the assault came ahead of an @entity14 meeting wednesday to reaffirm a decision to suspend @entity3 's membership , a move the group made over the weekend after president @entity20 's government failed to abide by a proposal to end a brutal crackdown on protesters			1
also wednesday , @entity25 recalled its ambassador to @entity3 , the @entity24 said			1
the move followed attacks on @entity25 missions in @entity3			1
the defector group , called the @entity30 , said it attacked an air intelligence base in @entity32 and planted " powerful explosions inside and around the compound that shook its foundations			1
" @entity36 , an expert on @entity3 at the @entity37 , said air intelligence has been deeply involved in the eight - month - long crackdown by the @entity3 government against protesters , a grinding civil conflict that the @entity43 says has left more than 3,500 people dead			1
@entity36 said the strike reflects the growing sophistication of the @entity30 , which has brigades across the country and has been in existence since the summer			1
" it opens up a new era of the conflict , " he said , adding that the development represents " a bad direction " for the country			1
" until now , most of the protests have been peaceful			0
" the @entity30 said it " carried out special operations in various areas in @entity60 in order to spoil the plan that the regime is preparing against our people and our homeland			1
" the regime should " take note " that the deserter force " is capable of striking them in any place and at any time we want , " the group said			0
activists said the deserter army used rocket - propelled grenades and the intelligence complex was damaged			0
activists also reported damage at the complex in @entity32 , an eastern suburb of the capital , @entity60			2
free @entity30 lt. @entity84 , speaking to @entity0 in @entity82 , @entity83 , called the late - night operation brief			1
he said 20 defectors armed with rocket - propelled grenades and kalashnikov rifles participated and that it involved people from inside as well as outside the security branch			0
he did n't know whether security forces suffered casualties but he said no rebels were hurt			0
he called air intelligence " one of the most terrifying secret service departments in @entity3 " and said such security entities will be targeted by defectors			2
" this branch is responsible for many of the crimes against @entity3 people and political prisoners , " @entity84 said			2
" we will announce the whole story to the world in the correct time			0
" it was one of five actions reported by the opposition force , which has recently emerged as an important factor in the opposition movement as more and more soldiers have left the @entity3 army			1
the opposition force also reported clashes with personnel loyal to @entity20 in several areas			0
they include @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity60 neighborhoods , and @entity124 , a suburb			0
there was also fierce fighting in @entity128 , a city in the @entity3 countryside			2
" a clash between the @entity30 and @entity20 's criminal gangs and his mobsters ( the shabiha ) in @entity128 , our free @entity3 military caused the @entity20 's gangs a lesson that they will never forget and heavy losses at the roundabout in the @entity140 , " the army said			1
the shabiha are pro-government militias			0
@entity36 said the @entity30 consists of soldiers who 've left their posts instead of obeying orders to fire on protesters			2
they 've also had active operations in and around @entity147 , @entity148 and other areas recently , he said			0
opposition groups like the @entity30 have been calling on the international community to help protect protesters			2
they have urged the @entity43 to impose a no - fly zone , as it did in the @entity156 conflict , and a naval blockade			0
@entity30 leaders have said such policies could allow them to establish a base of operations to launch a campaign to bring down @entity20 's regime			2
the group surfaced when seven military officers , believed to be original members of the @entity30 , announced their defection in a video posted on @entity169 in july			2
the group 's leaders , who had been exiled to @entity83 , say they 're directing a guerrilla war effort against the @entity20 regime , which acknowledges an increasing number of deadly attacks on its soldiers , including a bombing of a @entity3 army tank near @entity180 recently			1
col. @entity181 , a 30 - year veteran of the @entity3 air force , claims to lead a force in @entity3 cities of some 10,000 mainly low - ranking soldiers , a number impossible to verify			2
but the opposition fighters are believed to have little firepower -- planting bombs and carrying out hit and run attacks -- and they 're a small force in comparison with @entity3 's military , which numbers in the hundreds of thousands			2
the group has a @entity198 page , which calls on other soldiers to join it			0
the @entity14 , meeting in @entity202 , @entity203 , said @entity20 did n't stick by his pledge to release detainees , withdraw armed elements from populated areas , and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and @entity14 monitors			0
the league has also called for unspecified sanctions against @entity3 and called on member states to withdraw their ambassadors from @entity60 , a decision that will be up to each nation			2
the @entity217 , a state - run outlet , quoted a government source as saying that " @entity3 decided not to participate " in @entity202 , where there was a ministerial meeting of the @entity14 council and an @entity223 - @entity83 cooperation meeting			1
@entity83 foreign minister @entity224 told the @entity223 - @entity83 group that the @entity14 's move to suspend @entity3 's membership was " a responsible and well - timed step that put forth the gravity of the situation			1
" he said @entity3 had n't fulfilled commitments to the league and the @entity83 to rein in the instability			1
a former ally of @entity3 , @entity83 has threatened to cut off power supplies if @entity3 does not change course			1
@entity83 's @entity236 said it has suspended negotiations with @entity3 over joint oil exploration			1
" the @entity3 administration should read the message of the @entity14 correctly , and by ending the violence it is inflicting on its people open up the way for the inevitable process of democratic transformation			2
it is not possible for any administration to win a struggle against its own people			0
it is not possible for an administration based on collective punishment and everyday killing people on the streets to be successful , " @entity224 said			0
" the @entity3 administration must know that public opinion in neither the @entity223 world nor the world at large can bear these heart - wrenching images forever			2
@entity260 is working against the @entity3 regime			2
all of the credit and the helping hands that have been extended to the @entity3 regime to date have been wasted , " he added			1
the final communique tuesday from the @entity223 - @entity83 forum " emphasized the necessity of halting the bloodshed and violence against @entity3 citizens , and the importance of taking urgent measures to assure the safety of civilians			1
the ministers stressed the importance of the stability and unity of @entity3 and the need for the resolution of the crisis without any foreign intervention			2
" the @entity223 ministers also " expressed their appreciation to @entity83 for providing temporary protection on its territories for @entity3 citizens who fled to @entity83			1
" @entity288 , @entity203 's ambassador to @entity3 , told @entity0 a demonstration occurred in front of his country 's embassy in @entity60 on wednesday			1
" there was some improper behavior in front of the embassy			0
the protesters threw tomatoes and rocks at the embassy and they brought down the @entity203 flag and raised the @entity3 flag instead , " @entity288 said			0
" i asked them to send in a delegation so i can listen to their demands and what they were protesting against			0
i explained to them @entity203 's stance in the @entity14 and then they left			0
the demonstration is over now			0
no one was physically attacked or injured			0
" @entity203 's @entity24 condemned the attacks on its embassy , the country 's official news agency reported			0
the @entity317 denounced an attack on its embassy			0
a @entity320 diplomat in @entity60 told @entity0 in an e-mail that windows were broken there			0
" the @entity3 government will shoulder the responsibility on maintaining the security of its diplomatic mission and the respect and safety of its staff , " said foreign affairs undersecretary @entity323			1
" it is clear that there was negligence on the part of the @entity3 government in providing the necessary measures to ensure the protection of the @entity317 diplomatic mission in @entity60 , and the protection of its staff			1
" on saturday , pro-government protesters attacked @entity223 and @entity83 entities in @entity60 , @entity341 and @entity342			0
the @entity83 have demanded compensation for damage to their buildings and they have evacuated families of diplomats and some nonessential personnel			0
on monday , @entity3 's state news agency reported that @entity3 's foreign minister publicly apologized for the embassy attacks			1
and @entity353 's @entity352 said this week that a person in @entity20 's position would step down , a statement observers interpreted as a call for the @entity3 president to do just that			0
for its part , the @entity3 government freed 1,180 detainees tuesday as part of the @entity14 peace plan			1
but opposition groups said the gesture was too little , too late			0
the death toll keeps mounting , they said , with at least 81 killed in clashes monday -- making it one of the deadliest days of the uprising			0
the number of civilians killed wednesday was 20 -- 11 in @entity147 , 7 in @entity148 , and 1 in each @entity180 and @entity60 suburbs -- said the @entity373 of @entity3 , a coalition of activists			1
@entity0 is not able to independently verify claims of fighting and casualties because the @entity3 government has restricted international media access to the country .			1

@entity30 says it knows of no casualties in assault on government complex
" it opens up a new era of the conflict , " a *scholar* says
a @entity83 diplomat says " helping hands " to @entity3 have been wasted
