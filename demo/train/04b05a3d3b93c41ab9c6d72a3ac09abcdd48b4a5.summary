-- the capture of @entity2 could be compared to a large group of trappers quietly snaring rare and dangerous prey			1
for days , @entity11 @entity10 commandos , the @entity6 and @entity8 intelligence agencies lay in wait for one of the alleged masterminds behind the deadly september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18			2
then over the weekend , they lured @entity2 to a point south of the eastern city and nabbed him			1
@entity8 officials said he did not put up a fight			1
not a shot was fired			2
but @entity2 had a reputation for hiding out in the open , relaxed and self - assured			1
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity26 last year , he said he was ready to talk to @entity8 investigators but " not as an interrogation			2
" he will now have that conversation , just not on his own terms			2
where he is now @entity2 is on the @entity33 heading to the @entity8 , a @entity8 military official said			1
after he was captured sunday , he was put on the @entity35 ship in the @entity36 and was interrogated by the @entity6 - led @entity37 , or @entity38			1
taking him by sea , rather than by air , allows investigators " maximum time to question him , " @entity8 officials said			2
but the sea transport is largely being done for logistical reasons			2
it 's difficult for the @entity8 to find countries in the region that will allow their territory to be used to transfer prisoners captured in operations such as this			1
@entity18 called the capture of @entity2 by the @entity8 a " kidnapping			1
" the @entity8 action was a violation of @entity18 sovereignty and was carried out without informing @entity18 officials , the @entity18 government said			2
there was already a @entity18 arrest warrant for @entity2 , but @entity18 justice minister @entity62 said an arrest had not been made because of the deteriorating security situation in the @entity17 area			1
@entity2 should be tried by a @entity18 court , the justice minister said			1
he called the @entity8 a country friendly to @entity18 but said it must discuss such operations with @entity18 beforehand			2
the @entity18 government said it expects the @entity8 to guarantee @entity2 's safety and rights , especially when it comes to a fair trial			1
where he is headed when he arrives , @entity2 is very likely headed to a federal trial			1
that 's what the @entity76 administration wants , a position at odds with some of the president 's @entity80 critics			2
sen. @entity82 of @entity83 wants to postpone criminal prosecution to give interrogation more time			2
" we should have some quality time with this guy			2
weeks and months , " he said			2
" do n't torture him , but have some quality time with him			0
" @entity93 sen. @entity92 wants to see @entity2 in the @entity8 military prison in @entity95 , @entity96			1
" where else can you take him to ? " @entity92 said @entity98 may be out of the question			0
it 's a prison the @entity76 administration has been trying to shutter			0
and no detainees have been added there since the president took office , said national security spokeswoman @entity106			0
where he will be tried the administration boasts that past prosecution of terrorism suspects in civilian courts has had a nearly 100 % conviction rate			0
aspiring @entity113 bomber @entity112 , the so - called underwear bomber @entity114 , radical cleric @entity114 , and @entity116 propagandist @entity115 were all convicted and sentenced in @entity8 courts			0
hundreds more were as well , according to @entity120 lawmakers on armed services committees			1
many of them are locked away at the " @entity127 " prison in @entity125 , @entity126			0
by contrast , there have been a mere handful of @entity95 convictions			0
the prosecution of the confessed mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , @entity135 , has hit one snag after the next and is still in the pretrial phase			0
@entity138 weighed in on wednesday , asking for @entity2 to be provided access to a lawyer and to appear promptly before a judge			1
the @entity8 " is obligated under international law , regardless of the manner in which @entity2 was taken into custody , to provide him due process protections and a fair trial , " the group said			1
it is possible that the @entity18 lack the capability to arrest some suspects or provide a fair trial , but the @entity76 administration should provide the legal basis for why it made the arrest without alerting the host country , the group said			1
what his defense is @entity2 says he was directing traffic in @entity17 when fighters attacked the @entity8 mission with mortars and rockets that night			1
ambassador @entity164 and it expert @entity165 died of smoke inhalation			0
more than 30 @entity8 were evacuated			0
early the next morning , attackers assaulted a second @entity8 facility , killing two former @entity169 working there as security contractors : @entity171 and @entity172			0
@entity2 was at the @entity8 mission during the first attack			1
but he chalks that up to happenstance			0
" i did n't know where the place was , " he said			0
" when i heard , we went to examine the situation			0
when we withdrew and there was shooting with medium guns , and there were @entity181 's in the air and people panicked , we tried to control traffic			0
" but a @entity186 investigation describes his role as less than nonchalant , reporting that @entity2 helped lead the onslaught			1
@entity8 investigators have collected evidence , and the accused will be tried on three charges in federal court that include killing while attacking a federal facility , and conspiracy and material support of terrorism			1
" we retain the option of adding additional charges in the coming days , " @entity8 attorney general @entity197 said			0
what the political ramifications are the word " @entity17 " has had the ring of @entity120 partisan politics from day one -- literally			1
with the 2012 presidential election just two months away , a @entity80 candidate issued a statement criticizing @entity76 just hours after the attack			0
with the prospect of former secretary of state @entity211 running for the @entity212 in 2016 , @entity17 remains a sore spot that opponents have continuously prodded			0
last year , @entity212 @entity80 leaders released a 46 - page report on @entity17 , in which they accused @entity217 of slashing security at the @entity8 compound there			0
they also accused the @entity76 administration of a politically inspired cover - up when former @entity223 ambassador @entity222 , now @entity76 's national security adviser , blamed the unrest on spontaneous protests against an @entity228 video made in @entity8			0
on tuesday , @entity217 told @entity0 in a televised interview that she 's " very pleased " that special forces captured @entity2			1
but she was met with a new potential critic , the mother of one of the men who died in the attack			0
@entity235 delivered a message to @entity217 through @entity0 , demanding answers about security concerns at the @entity17 mission that preceded the attack			0
@entity217 said that she is still looking for those answers herself			0
hiding in plain sight : captured @entity17 suspect an enigma @entity17 attack time line lawmaker : if @entity0 can interview @entity2 , why ca n't @entity6 ? @entity0 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity2 is being held on the @entity33
terror suspect @entity253 did not put up a fight when captured
he is to face trial in federal court
his capture may have political ramifications in @entity120
