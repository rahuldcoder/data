-- @entity1 was logging onto @entity2 on thursday morning when something happened that she found deeply unsettling			1
ireporter @entity4 says @entity2 needs a competitor so users do n't panic when it goes down			1
" i got some weird error message , and i 'm like , ' what 's going on ! ? " the 24 - year - old said			0
that error message was the scourge of online social networkers worldwide on thursday as cyber-attacks shut down @entity2 and caused sustained glitches in other social - media sites like @entity15 and the blogging site @entity17			1
@entity2 co-founder @entity18 wrote the sites were the victims of what " appears to be a single , massively coordinated attack			1
" and a pro-georgian blogger , whose accounts on @entity15 and @entity2 reportedly were the targets of the denial - of - service attack , told @entity0 the online strike was timed to coincide with the one - year anniversary of the @entity31 - @entity30 conflict			1
what may prove more lasting about the day social networking suffered its first major blackout is the degree to which people cared			2
near - panic erupted in some corners of the internet as people lost cherished links to their online friends , family members and news feeds			2
watch @entity0 @entity45 talk about the attack part of the panic relates to the sheer popularity of the sites			2
@entity2 saw a more than 1,300 percent jump in unique visitors between february 2008 and february 2009 , according to @entity52			1
the site , which lets users post messages of 140 characters or less , had more than 44 million worldwide users in june , according to @entity58			2
more than 120 million users log onto @entity15 at least one time each day , the site says			1
to be sure , not all @entity15 and @entity2 users freaked out because of the attacks			1
some people even reveled in the mayhem			0
blog : could the attacks be our fault ? but for people like @entity1 , who said she " felt naked " without access to @entity2 , the attacks were a serious reality check -- a chance to evaluate just how dependent they 'd become			1
" you know how you pat your pockets for your cell phone and your keys ? well it 's that same kind of phantom [ limb ] with @entity2 , " she said			1
" it 's like , ' i ca n't update ! i ca n't update ! ' it 's just one of those bugs that gets in you			0
" she added : " i was pretty upset , actually			0
it feels like a lifeline for me ... pretty much everyone knows almost every detail of my life by what i 'm doing on @entity2			1
" it 's not worth analyzing whether these online connections are good or bad because the reality is that @entity2 and @entity15 are now an important part of our lives , said @entity100 , a journalism professor at the @entity101 's @entity102			1
" for many people , and not just young people , the @entity104 is not just media , it 's actually a place where they conduct their lives or a portion of their lives , " he said			0
" so the panic [ thursday ] morning is only reflective of that			2
this is not just a hobby or an amusement or another accoutrement , it 's actually deeply woven into their lives and is integral to their social interaction			2
so when it 's cut off , it 's a problem			0
" others saw @entity2 's existence as the problem and relished the chance to make fun of a web site that has become so omnipresent in news cycles			1
" horrors ! ! ! people will have to communicate face to face ! " one user commented on @entity0 's @entity132 blog			2
another commenter said , " turn off your computers and read a book or get outside and discover there is more to life than cyberspace			0
the @entity142 has become nothing more than the new cocaine			0
" now that @entity2 is back online , the no. 1 conversation thread on the site is called " whentwitterwasdown , " where users discuss what they did without their real - time @entity2 updates			1
some people are mocking the blackout			0
a user named @entity155 , for instance , wrote , " i took up juggling			2
" i did absolutely nothing			0
it 's like my heart was gone , " wrote a user named @entity159			2
" i felt so empty inside , " wrote another @entity2 user called freinhar			1
some business people on thursday realized just how much they depend on @entity15 and @entity2 to do their work			1
@entity166 , editor - in - chief at @entity167 , a blog that covers social media , said the outage made it difficult for his organization to cover the news and to promote its stories			2
" for someone like myself who spends all day on @entity2 , it 's incredibly frustrating , " he told @entity0			1
@entity176 , a 31 - year - old who works in web strategy at a marketing company near @entity179 , @entity180 , said thursday 's attack made him realize just how dependent on @entity2 he had become			1
" when something that 's so central to how you do your business or how you gather information goes down , yeah , you get a little jittery -- like , when 's it going to be back , " he said			0
" i did n't break out in hives or anything like that , " he said , jokingly			0
@entity4 , an ireporter in @entity192 , said he thinks @entity2 needs a competitor so users will have an alternative if the site is down			1
watch @entity4 's talk about the issue on @entity0 's @entity199 and @entity200 , who writes about social media on a blog called @entity203 , said all technologies can break down , so people need to make contingency plans			0
" @entity207 , when you get down to it , you can lose your voice or break your writing hand or have a stroke and be unable to communicate			0
we are fundamentally social creatures , and when we lack our usual communication channels it 's scary , " she writes			0
have a backup plan , and be prepared			0
" @entity100 , the @entity101 professor , said the fuss surrounding thursday 's attack is a sign that instant , online communication is here to stay			1
fighting the trend would be like trying to stop the ocean 's tides , he said , but it 's unclear where the technology will take our society			0
" the bottom line is that we do n't know			0
all of this is too new , " he said			0
" it 's like sitting around in the year 1500 and trying to figure out where the printing press was going to take us			0

some @entity2 and @entity15 users panicked as the sites went down thursday
several online social networks were the victims of cyber-attacks
one @entity2 user says she felt " naked " without her *micro-blog*
another says he felt " jittery " during the time @entity2 was down
