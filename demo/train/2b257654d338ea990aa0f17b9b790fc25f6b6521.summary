@entity0 , @entity1 -- the deaths of two @entity1 teens are about to put a national focus on a little - recognized problem			1
@entity7 , 16 , and @entity8 , 18 , were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in @entity0 , in southern @entity1			1
local teenagers said the site is a popular hangout because it 's quiet and secluded			1
but the dead teens ' parents say the explosion could have been prevented if some warning signs had been posted -- " something simple as fences , gates and signs , probably very inexpensive , and certainly a lot less expensive that what a child 's life is worth , " said @entity8 's father , @entity26			1
police say they do n't know exactly what ignited flammable vapors inside the tank			2
when it exploded , the teenagers were killed instantly			1
their bodies were found about 40 yards from the tank 's base ; the tank landed another 20 yards from them			2
investigators say they found a lighter , but do n't know whether it was involved			2
" i could n't believe that my child was gone , " @entity8 's mother , @entity40 , told @entity2			2
the @entity8 and @entity7 families have an ally in their camp			0
the @entity45 , created by @entity46 , investigated the accident and found at least 40 other deaths involving oil and gas wells in the past 25 years			1
most of them involved young people			0
the @entity45 says it found a patchwork of laws nationwide that do n't uniformly address security around oil and gas wells			1
it 's asking the industry to police itself by voluntarily installing fences and warning signs			1
" if these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere , no protection around them , no warning , they are just an accident waiting to happen , " @entity45 chairman @entity63 told @entity2			2
@entity72 , the company that owns the tank that blew up , told @entity2 it could not discuss the accident because of pending negligence lawsuits filed by the families			2
a spokesman called the boys ' deaths tragic , but the company says it is complying with all rules			2
however , authorities tell @entity2 there are no state regulations requiring locked gates or no - smoking signs			1
" he may be in compliance , " @entity87 sheriff @entity86 told @entity2			0
" but there 's nothing in the rules for him to be in compliance with			0
" @entity0 is about 40 miles north of the @entity94			1
in nearby @entity96 , city zoning laws require oil and gas tanks to be fenced in with warning signs , according to emergency management district executive director @entity100			1
the @entity45 asked family and friends of @entity7 and @entity8 to help them make an educational video about the dangers of oil and gas production sites			1
it 's called " @entity111 to hang out , " and it 's part of a national campaign starting this week to teach young people about the potential danger of tanks			0
but it also urges the industry to improve itself			0
" there 's nothing we can do to bring @entity117 and wade back , " said @entity8 's girlfriend , @entity113 , 16			0
" but if it can save someone else 's life , i 'd like to see it happen			0
" " like @entity123 , " added another friend , @entity122			0
" they have to put ' caution			0
this coffee 's hot ' ( on their cups )			0
i really think they need signs warning ' this is a dangerous place			1
' " @entity1 state sen. @entity132 told @entity2 he plans to introduce a state law requiring barbed - wire - topped fences , locked gates and " @entity136 " signs			1
" there 's no guarantees , " @entity132 said			0
" you could cut the fence with a bolt cutter , or you can shoot off a lock			0
but it 'll be a deterrent , and it 's a step in the right direction			0
" @entity8 's father says his son would be proud that friends and family are speaking out : " he 'd be proud that we 're trying to do something to keep other kids and other families from going through what we 're going through			0
