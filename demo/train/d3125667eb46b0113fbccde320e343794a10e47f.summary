-- he had the firm backing of world no. 1 @entity3 as well as @entity6 's @entity5 talisman @entity4 , and on tuesday night it was made official -- @entity9 will captain the continent against the @entity11 in 2014			1
despite a late bid from successful 2010 captain @entity13 , who was keen to do the job on home soil in @entity16 , player power won out as the @entity18 was confirmed at a press conference in @entity20			1
the 46 - year - old played in three winning @entity5 teams and holed the clinching putt for @entity6 during the 2002 clash at @entity25 , in @entity26			1
@entity9 was trumpeted for the role by @entity3 several times on monday , and also by @entity29 duo @entity4 -- one of @entity6 's heroes who inspired their dramatic comeback in @entity33 last year -- and former world @entity34			1
@entity3 said @entity13 -- an eight - time @entity37 winner -- had " nothing to gain " by reprising his role and @entity9 told reporters he was proud to be the first ever @entity41 @entity5 captain			1
he said : " i 'm obviously absolutely thrilled and delighted to lead the team with the strongest , in - depth @entity37 in history ; to be leading the cream of the crop is a huge honor			0
" i knew i had the strong backing of the players			2
i thought the more i would say the more my chances would lessen			0
i watched with interest in the last few weeks as my chances went up and down like a yo - yo			0
" to be honest it is quite a humbling experience to be sitting in this seat			0
it 's a week i 'm really looking forward to			0
i 've been there many times as a player and as a vice captain but i 'm looking forward to being a captain			1
" @entity6 has won five of the last six installments of the biannual team competition , including a stunning comeback victory at the last meeting in @entity33 last year , when @entity9 was vice captain to @entity67			1
despite taking a big 10 - 6 lead into the final day singles matches , the @entity11 were stunned by a @entity6 comeback as the visitors won @entity72 to @entity73 in what has become known as ' the miracle of @entity76			2
' @entity3 was one of the @entity6 stars , alongside @entity4 , and @entity9 said the backing he got from the world 's best player was a big factor in him getting the job			1
" its humbling when the new star of world golf comes out in your favor , " he said			0
" that means a lot to me			0
" there 's a couple of good things that have happened for me in terms of getting this role			0
one of those is @entity3 and @entity96 ( 2010 @entity97 champion ) played in the @entity98 , which was my first captaincy			1
" i had the opportunity of captaining him , and @entity3 and @entity96 were huge for me that week			2
i was fortunate i had that situation where @entity3 played underneath me and that 's why he spoke with such authority on the subject			1
" after their painful defeat in @entity33 the @entity11 turned to one of the game 's greatest ever players , @entity110 , who was the last man to captain a winning @entity11 team on @entity6 soil back in 1993			1
@entity9 said he was honored to be squaring up against the eight - time major winner			2

@entity37 chief exec @entity135 added : " it 's a wonderful achievement for @entity9			2
it was a unanimous decision of the players ' committee and was testimony to the democracy of the process			0

@entity9 named @entity6 @entity5 captain for 2014 clash in @entity16
players had backed @entity18 instead of 2010 captain @entity13
@entity3 , @entity4 and @entity34 all threw *weight* behind @entity9
@entity9 was vice captain to @entity67 during @entity6 's win in 2012
