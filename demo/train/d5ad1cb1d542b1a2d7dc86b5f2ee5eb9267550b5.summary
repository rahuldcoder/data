@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration appealed friday to the @entity5 @entity4 to delay next week 's scheduled execution in @entity7 of a @entity9 national convicted of kidnapping , raping and murdering a 16 - year - old girl			1
the execution of @entity31 , who was sentenced to death for the 1994 crimes , " would place the @entity5 in irreparable breach of its international - law obligation to afford ( @entity18 ) review and reconsideration of his claim that his conviction and sentence were prejudiced by @entity7 authorities ' failure to provide consular notification and assistance under the @entity29 , " wrote solicitor general @entity13 , in a friend - of - the - court brief			1
in a separate document , a letter to @entity7 governor @entity36 , the @entity37 asked that he commute the sentence to life in prison , according to @entity42 , a spokesman for @entity43			0
the two requests were based on the failure of @entity7 authorities to grant the 38 - year - old @entity47 -- who has lived in the @entity5 since he was 2 years old -- access to a @entity9 consular official at the time of his arrest			1
" the lack of consular assistance and advice raises concerns about whether or not mr. @entity31 's right to a fair trial was fully upheld , " @entity42 said			2
the case " raises questions " regarding compliance with a 2004 @entity61 ruling in what is known as the @entity64 case that the @entity5 failed to fulfill its obligations to 51 @entity9 on death row in @entity5 jails when it did not inform them of their right to contact their consular representatives " without delay " after their arrests , he said			1
" if the scheduled execution of mr. @entity31 goes ahead , the @entity5 government will have implemented a death penalty after a trial that did not comply with due process rights , " said @entity75 , the @entity76 on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions			1
" this will be tantamount to an arbitrary deprivation of life			0
" in its 30 - page brief , the @entity3 administration said that complying with its obligations to notify consuls in such cases would serve @entity5 interests as well as those of the condemned man			2
" these interests include protecting @entity5 abroad , fostering cooperation with foreign nations , and demonstrating respect for the international rule of law , " it said			0
evidence introduced at his trial included two statements he made to the police on the day of the murder " during noncustodial interviews " that incriminated him			0
his lawyers have said that the failure of @entity7 to notify and give him access to the @entity9 consul " required suppression of the incriminating statements he made to the police , " the filing said			1
he is scheduled to be put to death thursday			2
but the @entity7 trial court found that , because he was not in custody at the time he gave the statements , @entity29 obligations did not apply			0
the @entity61 said the remedy to the 2004 @entity64 case " consists in the obligations of the @entity5 to provide , by means of its own choosing , review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of ( affected ) @entity9 nationals			1
" in 2005 , then - president @entity137 said the @entity5 would discharge its obligations under @entity64 by having state courts address them			2
that was called into question by a 2008 case that found that " neither @entity64 nor the president 's memorandum constitutes directly enforceable federal law that pre-empts state limitations on the filing of subsequent habeas petitions			0
" but it said that @entity151 could pass a law addressing the obligations imposed by the @entity64 decision			0
the administration noted in its filing friday that the recently introduced @entity159 bill -- the @entity160 -- would put the @entity5 into compliance with its international obligations under @entity64			0
it added that , since passage of that legislation by the @entity167 may take until early next year , @entity47 's death sentence should be delayed until then			2
that argument did not persuade the district court , which noted that " the filing of proposed legislation which might one day afford petitioner a remedy in the state or federal courts does not , standing alone , justify a stay of execution			0
" the court of appeals has backed up the lower court , concluding that @entity18 does not have " a due process right to remain alive until the proposed @entity64 legislation becomes law			0
" but the administration said that going ahead with @entity47 's execution would cause " irreparable harm " to @entity5 foreign policy interests by putting the @entity5 " in irremediable breach " of its international - law obligation			1
" that breach would have serious repercussions for @entity5 foreign relations , law - enforcement and other cooperation with @entity9 , and the ability of @entity5 citizens traveling abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in the event of detention			1

@entity31 was sentenced to death for the 1994 rape and murder of a 16 - year - old girl
@entity47 , a @entity9 national , has lived in the @entity5 since he was 2 years old
he was not granted access to the @entity9 consul prior to making incriminating statements
his execution is scheduled for thursday
