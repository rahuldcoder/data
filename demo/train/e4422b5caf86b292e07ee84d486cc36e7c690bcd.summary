-- what happened in @entity2 in the last nine months is momentous , an ongoing event of real historical importance			1
when in january of this year zine el abidine @entity5 left the country after he indulged in a ' presidency ' that lasted almost 24 years , @entity2 were hopeful , yet also slightly anxious about the future			1
now they have voted in the first free and fair elections in the country 's history			0
voter turnout has reportedly been very high			0
international observers confirmed that the electoral process has been sound			0
tunisians have rallied around these elections as a focal point for a new chapter in their history			0
the islamically oriented @entity23 has won more seats than any other party			1
previously banned , the party is heavily influenced by the ideas of @entity28 who returned to @entity2 from exile in @entity31 earlier this year			1
if at the beginning of his political career , @entity28 flirted with rather more radical forms of @entity36 , including the revolutionary model in @entity38 , he made it clear upon his arrival in @entity40 that he should not be compared to @entity42 , the leader of the @entity44 revolution of 1979			1
the success of @entity23 is indicative of a wider ideational trend that has engulfed the @entity48 - @entity44 world for quite some time now : the shift from ideological @entity44 to civic @entity44 ( @entity50 ) or what i have called a " post-modernised @entity44 " elsewhere			1
the democratic commitment of movements such as @entity23 , but also the @entity58 in @entity59 , the @entity53 in @entity54 and the reformists in @entity38 is the outcome of changed attitudes towards the functions of religion in the political sphere			2
what is slowly being engineered is an @entity44 that is geared to cultural emancipation , rather than ideological indoctrination			1
post-modern @entity44 is politically secular and operates in a distinctly pragmatist mode			2
as such it is entirely promiscuous in its choice of strategies and allies			0
there are almost no taboos when it comes to this new breed of " islamists			0
" this is very different from the heydays of modern @entity36 whose godfather , @entity82 , and @entity58 founder @entity83 had very specific and rather doctrinal ideas about the function of @entity44 in politics			1
from the perspective of @entity82 , @entity44 was a revolutionary ideology that required a vanguard of committed and pious activists in order to take over the state and to establish an " authentically " @entity58 order			2
political power had to be assumed , if necessary by force			0
@entity44 would function not only in the cultural sphere as a nodal point for @entity58 - majority societies			1
@entity44 would constitute the sovereignty of the state and its organs			2
it would be a total @entity44 , intrusive and radical			2
today , post-modern @entity44 is primarily geared to the cultural and socio - economic preferences of the burgeoning middle - classes in the region whose politics is certainly not revolutionary			1
neither does the emergence of this post-modern @entity44 necessarily translate into virulent anti-americanism			2
nonetheless , parties like @entity23 are very likely to steer toward a rather more equidistant relationship to the @entity115			2
they are also likely to confront @entity117 more vigorously on the @entity119 issue , quite comparable to the current policies of @entity54 which has suspended military and intelligence cooperation with @entity117 over the killing of @entity54 aid workers on the flotilla that was bound for @entity126 last year			0
as such , " post-modern @entity44 " retains the emphasis on independence demanded by the first generation of @entity44			0
so with the emergence of electoral politics out of the @entity48 revolts , we are witnessing the establishment of viable democratic structures that are carried forward by functioning civil societies			0
the time of one - man dictatorships that are subservient to outside demands because of a lack of domestic legitimacy is over			1
during this process of confrontation between state and society , @entity44 politics have been transformed from revolutionary @entity36 which peaked in @entity38 in 1979 to the emergence of a post-modern , secularised , democratic , civic @entity44 that is a part of the political mix in muslim - majority societies today			1
@entity2 made the first step to that end in the @entity48 world and the elections must be considered a milestone in their struggle for freedom and democracy			0
the @entity2 government that will emerge in the next weeks and months will rule with the mandate of the people and the momentum of a mass revolt behind it			0
in light of the evidence on the ground , one has to remain hopeful that the new @entity2 will not squander the opportunity that history has given it .			0

moderate @entity36 party @entity23 wins *plurality* of votes in @entity2 election
@entity177 : election signals shift from ideological @entity44 to civic @entity44
@entity177 : time of one - man dictatorships in region is over
