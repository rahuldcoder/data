@entity0 -- the @entity4 administration is lifting the moratorium on deep - water oil drilling -- put in place after the @entity9 oil spill disaster -- for operators who comply with tough new rules and regulations , interior secretary @entity2 announced tuesday			1
" there will always be risks associated with deep - water drilling , " @entity2 said			1
" we have reached a point where we have significantly reduced those risks			0
" the six - month moratorium was first issued by @entity2 in may after the april 20 explosion of @entity23 's @entity22 drilling rig in the @entity9 that killed 11 people and triggered one of the worst environmental disasters in @entity28 history			1
an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 206 million gallons ) of oil gushed into the @entity9 before the broken well , 5,000 feet below the surface , was capped			0
@entity2 's initial moratorium was overturned by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by an appeals court			1
the interior secretary then issued a second ban in june that was scheduled to expire in november			0
critics of the ban , including @entity40 leaders , @entity9 state officials and @entity43 residents , said it would only hurt oil and gas workers in the already hard - hit coastal communities , where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster			1
environmental groups and other supporters of the moratorium argued it was necessary due to a lack of effective regulation of deep - water drilling that allowed the @entity22 explosion and subsequent spill to occur			1
tuesday 's decision came three weeks before congressional elections in which @entity59 are expected to lose seats in both chambers , and possibly lose control of the @entity63			2
asked if the move was politically motivated to help @entity9 state candidates in tough races , @entity63 press secretary @entity64 said it was based on the completion of a proper policy review			1
" this is a very deliberative policy process , " @entity64 said			1
" it puts in place some important safety steps to ensure that when it is done again , it is done safely			0
" @entity2 said the moratorium provided time to make sure similar accidents involving a failed piece of equipment called a blowout preventer would n't occur , and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worst - case scenarios if it did happen			1
under the new requirements , operators must show that their proposed development and exploration plans can deal with potential blowouts and undergo detailed inspections and design reviews of blowout preventers by independent third parties , said @entity94 , the new head of the federal agency that oversees offshore oil drilling			1
@entity94 said it might take time for companies to come into full compliance , but he expected some permits for resumed drilling to be approved by the end of the year			1
" we will not approve permits without vital supplemental information required by the rules , " said @entity94 , director of the @entity105			1
@entity59 sen. @entity110 of @entity111 , a critic of the moratorium , called tuesday 's announcement a good first step but said more was needed to help the region 's oil and gas industry get back to work			2
" this means that the administration must continue to accelerate the granting of permits in shallow and deep water , and provide greater certainty about the rules and regulations industry must meet , " @entity110 said in a statement			2
@entity110 has blocked @entity127 consideration of president @entity4 's nomination of @entity129 to become the new director of the @entity131 to protest the moratorium			2
her statement said she would study the situation in coming weeks before deciding whether to lift her hold on the nomination when the @entity127 returns from recess after the november 2 congressional elections			0
@entity64 told reporters that the @entity129 nomination was unrelated to the oil spill issue and he criticized @entity110 for playing politics			1
" we have said from the beginning that the hold was unwarranted and outrageous , " he said			0
the chairman of the @entity148 subcommittee , @entity59 rep. @entity146 of @entity149 , praised the moratorium as a necessary step to instill safety in the drilling industry			1
" this deepwater drilling suspension was always about keeping the @entity9 workers and waters safe from another oil spill , and it has been effective in doing so , " @entity146 said in a statement			2
" the new rules that the @entity160 has issued will help ensure that if oil companies are going to drill ultra-deep , they are doing so in a manner that is ultra-safe			0
" environmental groups questioned if enough had been done to prevent another rig explosion and spills like the one that took oil giant @entity23 and the government months to contain			0
" today 's actions are premature , " said a statement from @entity170 , executive director of the @entity171			0
" the difficult clean - up process in the @entity9 has taught us prevention is key			0
to ensure a disaster like this never happens again , we must know what caused it in the first place			2
we 're still waiting for that answer and until we get it -- the moratorium should remain in place			2
" @entity184 , an attorney for @entity185 , said it was " surprising the federal government thinks it has so quickly resolved all the problems that contributed to the spill			0
" " we learned from this spill that we have only a tiny fraction of what 's necessary to control deep water oil spills , " @entity184 said in a statement			0
" while we 've now got some new regulations that address technology and safety , the federal government still has n't come up with any new regulations addressing oil spill response			0
we still do n't have the equipment or technology to control or contain the oil from a major blowout in the @entity9			0
" however , @entity203 gov. @entity203 of @entity111 said the moratorium should have been lifted sooner , and that he now worried that " severe bottlenecks in the federal permit review process have resulted in a de facto moratorium for shallow water drilling , " the moratorium affected 36 operators , half of which were able to continue some level of work such as helping to dig relief tunnels that capped the broken well , @entity2 said			1
lifting the moratorium means applications for 18 exploratory wells can again move forward , providing they comply with the tougher new regulations and rules , he said			2
" the policy position we 've articulated today is that we 're open for business , " @entity2 said			1
" we will be taking applications for drilling in the deep water and we 'll be processing those applications under the road map ... created in the last six months			0
" @entity1 's chief national correspondent @entity227 contributed to this story .			0
