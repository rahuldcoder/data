@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity5 approached an impromptu checkpoint leading to this tiny village in eastern @entity1 , four men blocking the narrow path started marching toward him in menacing unison			1
" i am here to see @entity16 , " the " @entity10 " actor said and i translated , with correspondent @entity12 and cameraman @entity13 next to us			2
" go away ! " the plainclothes guards barked , pushing us back			0
amid the scuffling and yelling , dozens more guards in olive - green , military - style overcoats -- and two gray minivans -- emerged from the other side of the checkpoint , all coming toward us			0
" why can i not visit this free man ? " @entity5 asked repeatedly , only to receive punches from guards aiming for his small camera as they tried to drag him away from the rest of us			2
as we retreated , i recognized the ringleader -- the same burly man who had hurled rocks at the @entity2 team 10 months earlier to force us out of the same location			0
a precarious scene ensued thursday as one of the gray minivans chased our car at high speed on bumpy country roads for some 40 minutes			0
when the dust settled , we counted a broken car , a damaged camera -- and a @entity48 star disappointed at -- but not shocked by -- his failure to see a personal hero			0
" what i really wanted to do was to meet the man , shake his hand and say what an inspiration he is , " @entity5 said			2
the man , 40 - year - old @entity16 , has been confined to his home along with his wife , mother and daughter , and watched around the clock by dozens of guards since he was released from prison in september 2010			1
a local court had sentenced him to more than four years in prison for damaging property and disrupting traffic in a protest			0
@entity1 activist recovers amid call for his release his supporters maintain authorities used trumped - up charges to silence @entity16 , a blind , self - taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices by @entity1 's family - planning officials			1
@entity5 first learned about @entity16 through news reports , including our coverage in february , when he was in @entity1 filming " @entity85 , " a wartime drama set in 1930s @entity87 in which he plays a mortician trying to save a group of schoolgirls from the clutches invading @entity93 soldiers			1
blind lawyer makes @entity96 officials jittery the injustice faced by the activist and his family stirred such strong emotions in @entity5 that , upon hearing his impending return to @entity1 to promote the movie , he decided to do something unusual to raise the international awareness of @entity16 and thereby to turn up the heat on the @entity96 government			1
" this does n't come naturally to me , this is not what i actually enjoy -- it is n't about me , " he explained during our eight - hour drive from @entity109 to the eastern city of @entity111 , where @entity16 's village is located			2
" but this was just a situation that said i ca n't look the other way			0
" known to be a media - shy celebrity , @entity5 reached out to @entity2 and invited us to join him on his journey to visit @entity16			1
in the car , he lamented the @entity126 public 's lack of knowledge on @entity16 's case , despite senior @entity126 officials ' increasingly vocal support for his freedom			2
secretary of state @entity133 and @entity134 , the @entity126 ambassador to @entity1 , have both championed @entity16 's cause			1
@entity5 appeared a little surprised to learn that @entity136 , which produced his 2010 @entity138 - winning " @entity137 " and recently filmed a comedy in @entity111 , was accused by activists of cozying up to the same officials who ordered @entity16 's detention and torture			1
the studio has issued a statement denying the allegation			0
although @entity1 's state media has largely ignored the story , @entity16 's plight has spread online and outraged a growing number of @entity96 " netizens			1
" many have tried to visit @entity16 , and activists say nearly all would - be visitors have been turned back , often violently , by plainclothes police and local thugs			0
" i 'm not brave doing this , " @entity5 emphasized			0
" the local people who are standing up to the authorities , who are visiting @entity16 and his family and getting beaten or detained , i want to support them			0
" as our car sped toward @entity109 in the dark , @entity5 wondered aloud if he would never be allowed back -- a prospect he is prepared to accept -- even as " @entity85 " became @entity1 's official entry into next year 's @entity138			1
" really , what else can i do to help @entity16 ? " he kept asking as the clock struck midnight , with his latest movie -- partially funded by the state -- about to open nationwide in @entity1 .			2
