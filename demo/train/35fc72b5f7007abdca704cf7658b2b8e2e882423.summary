-- @entity2 's decision to step down as @entity4 manager after more than a quarter of a century in charge leaves the club 's hierarchy with the unenviable task of replacing the @entity9 , given his phenomenal success at @entity11			1
@entity2 has won more than 30 trophies , including 13 @entity14 league championships and two @entity15			2
it is a record that most managers might wilt under given the level of expectation that will inevitably accompany @entity2 's successor			1
" it 's impossible to emulate @entity2 and deliver what he has done , " according to former @entity24 technical director and chief executive @entity25			1
" the brief for manager is to keep winning trophies			0
but @entity4 want to re-establish themselves as the no. 1 club in the world and they are a long way from that , " @entity25 told @entity0			2
" the club is a massive worldwide brand and is now judged on its @entity35 performance			0
on a worldwide basis the @entity36 is the @entity38			0
" perhaps the one criticism that could be made of the current squad is that it does n't have a @entity41 , a @entity42 or a @entity43			0
" @entity44 and @entity45 are two of the potential candidates in the frame to fill @entity2 's shoes -- @entity0 profiles the duo below and asks @entity25 to give a boardroom view on the two men 's chances at @entity11			1
@entity45 @entity44 has been heavily backed to succeed @entity2 despite hinting at a return to @entity54 , but @entity55 manager @entity45 is the favorite to take over from the 71 - year - old @entity9			1
appointed by the @entity58 - based club in march 2002 , @entity45 is very much in the @entity2 mold			1
both were born in @entity61 , though @entity2 played for @entity62 while @entity45 featured for city rivals @entity63 at the start of his playing career			1
the steely - eyed , taciturn @entity45 is now the third longest - serving manager in the @entity67 , behind @entity2 and @entity69 's @entity68			1
despite a lack of financial resources , @entity55 have consistently exceeded expectations under @entity73 and in 2005 the club qualified for the @entity36 , while also reaching the @entity75 final four years later			1
prior to joining @entity55 , @entity45 managed @entity76 , winning promotion from the third tier of @entity14 football to the brink of the @entity67			1
the question mark against the 50 - year - old is that he has never won any of the three major @entity14 trophies -- the @entity67 , the @entity75 and the @entity84			0
remarkably his @entity55 side has never been able to win at @entity4 , @entity54 , @entity69 or @entity58 in 44 attempts			1
his record in the transfer market is mixed			0
while @entity93 and @entity94 have been notable successes , the likes of @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 were underwhelming acquisitions			0
how would he cope with a bigger budget and better players at his disposal ? there is also the question of @entity45 ' relationship with one of @entity4 's star players -- @entity105			1
in 2008 , the @entity55 manager accepted " substantial " undisclosed libel damages when he sued @entity105 , his co-author @entity108 and @entity109 , the publishers of " @entity105 -- my @entity111 , " following allegations that he leaked details of a confidential conversation with the player			1
a year later @entity105 phoned @entity45 personally to apologize			2
if the @entity4 board do plump for @entity45 , they will not have to pay any compensation as the @entity9 's @entity55 contract runs out at the end of the season and no agreement has been reached over a new deal			1
@entity25 's verdict : " @entity45 is the favorite , but i think he is the conservative option			1
" if @entity45 is appointed , the club would be in good hands			2
he 's a balanced and sensible option			0
" i do n't think he would have a problem in taking charge of a club of @entity4 's size			1
he would also have the advantage of @entity2 potentially mentoring him			2
" on the flip side , there is @entity45 ' lack of @entity35 experience			2
there is also the lack of experience of working with star players			0
the bigger the ego , the harder they are to manage -- that is a special art. " having said that , @entity45 deserves a big job -- arguably it was n't realistic for @entity55 to qualify for the @entity36			1
" @entity44 over the last few weeks the coach of @entity152 club @entity151 has been strongly linked with a return to the @entity67 as his old team @entity54 seeks to replace interim manager @entity155			1
@entity44 offers the complete package as manager -- an unparalleled track record of success allied to an ability to motivate players that inspires loyalty long after he has moved on to new teams			2
he has the knack of getting journalists to eat out of his hands as he delivers a succession of quotable quotes			0
no coach gives better press conferences than @entity44 , evidenced by his pre-match briefing ahead of @entity151 's game with @entity176 this week as he skilfully squashed criticism from one of his own players and defiantly gave away no clues about his future			1
however , given he is the only coach to win @entity35 football 's top three leagues , @entity44 's time at the @entity183 has been mixed			2
the 50 - year - old @entity186 has won one @entity188 title , last season , but looks set to miss out to archrivals @entity190 this time around			0
he has also guided real to a @entity192 win , while his team will play city rivals @entity194 in this year 's final			0
but @entity44 's quest to win the @entity36 for a third time in his career has faltered at @entity151 , losing in the semifinals for three years in a row -- last month being beaten 4 - 3 on aggregate by @entity202 club @entity201			1
@entity44 has made no secret of his desire to return to @entity14 , with media reports claiming he has already negotiated a return to @entity54 at the end of the season			2
his previous spell in charge saw him lead the @entity211 to their first top - flight title for 55 years in 2005			2
he won five trophies in his three seasons in @entity215			0
@entity44 forged his reputation when his @entity218 side famously knocked @entity4 out of the @entity36 at @entity11 in 2004 , running down the touchline to celebrate the late clinching goal			1
@entity218 went on to win the @entity36 that year			0
after @entity218 and then @entity54 , @entity44 coached @entity221 , winning the @entity36 , the @entity223 league title and the @entity224 in his second and final season with the club , before leaving to join @entity151			1
but with that unimpeachable track record of success , comes volatility			0
as well as the incendiary media conferences , @entity44 has occasionally overstepped the mark -- no more so than in his 2011 altercation with the now @entity190 manager @entity233 , when the @entity186 coach poked his opponent in the eye when the @entity237 was @entity239 's assistant			1
" i 'm there to win , " @entity44 , who often refers to @entity2 as " @entity240 " , told @entity0 last year as he reflected on his coaching philosophy			1
" i 'm there with my team to try to win			0
i 'm there and i live the game , i live the match as if it was the last match of my career			0
" so people look at me and they see what they see			0
after that , in press conferences , it 's the other place where people know me			0
" in press conferences , there is still a match to play			0
before the match , press conference is pre-match and after the match , press conference is post-match , but it 's a match			0
" @entity25 's verdict : " @entity44 is the ideal candidate			2
he is the only manager who can offer you a guarantee of success			0
" with a manager with a lesser profile , if the next season does n't start well then they will come under immense pressure			0
" but given @entity44 's track record no - one can criticize @entity44			2
he has proven that he could work under the most intense pressure			0
" that is the biggest threat to a manager -- the environment that they are working in -- and when the pressure becomes too much , you become reactive rather than sticking to the plan			0
" you would never have that problem with @entity44			2
" as for whether @entity44 's combative personality would damage the @entity4 ' brand , ' he is clever enough to tone it down			1
do n't forget that @entity2 often thrived on conflict as a way of putting pressure on @entity4 's opponents			1
" the @entity4 job is a role where your persona is almost as important as your man - management skills -- it is about the statement that you make			2
" @entity44 fits the bill			0
he has that charisma that made @entity2 so special			0

@entity4 manager @entity2 is *retiring* after *26* years in charge
@entity55 manager @entity45 is the *frontrunner* to succeed @entity2
but one expert says @entity151 's @entity44 is the perfect choice
@entity300 : " it 's impossible to emulate @entity2 "
