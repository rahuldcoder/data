similar to many married couples , @entity10 and @entity50 envisioned owning a house perhaps two or three years down the road , they say			1

back in his hometown of @entity150 , a small city in western @entity23 , @entity10 's family and friends threw a benefit , raising $ 12,000 toward the costly medical bills			1

@entity50 found the home through a real estate agent on her lunch break one afternoon in early january			2
