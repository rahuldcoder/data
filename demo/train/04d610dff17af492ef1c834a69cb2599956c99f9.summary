@entity0 dreams of a new house away from the sea that almost killed her and her family , when @entity5 slammed into the eastern @entity6 one year ago			1
" we 're afraid to stay here , but we do n't have a choice , " the 25 - year - old mother said , as she looked out from their makeshift house near the shore in the coastal village of @entity12 , @entity13 , which was worst hit by @entity5			1
@entity0 said she and her 7 - year - old daughter still have nightmares about the typhoon , referred to locally as @entity5 , which left thousands dead or missing , and millions homeless			1
" when it rains , my daughter would hug me tight and cry , " she said			1
" i try to be strong but i am also scared			2
i do n't want to stay here , but i have to wait for the government because we ca n't afford to move on our own			2
" " the government said they have a plan for us			2
i just hope it will come soon			2
" ' danger zones ' @entity31 is among more than 70,000 residents living in coastal communities designated as danger zones by authorities in @entity13 , a bustling regional hub of 220,000 people			1
so far , only 250 of the residents have been relocated to permanent resettlement sites			1
providing safe homes for survivors is a top priority for @entity13 mayor @entity43 , whose seaside mansion was among those destroyed by the tidal surges			1
" we are in great need of transitional shelters , " he said			2
" we do n't have enough temporary homes , that 's why we ca n't relocate those in the danger zones			1
" but the construction of new houses has been hobbled by a lack of funds , available land , building materials and even manpower			2
bad weather has also slowed down work in some areas , @entity43 said			1
the government initially ordered that areas 40 meters from the coast would be designated as no - build zones			1
but the restriction was modified to a no - dwelling zone after commercial establishments warned of the impact on industries such as tourism and fishing			1
@entity75 , who heads the shelter cluster of @entity13 's recovery effort , said authorities were assessing the hazard risks of all 138 villages to come up with a building code tailored for the city			2
" it 's like going to war			0
i have a bulletproof vest and you do n't have one , then i will be more secure , " she said			0
" in a storm or whatever hazard , the building code will specifically say what kind of structures will be resilient in this place			0
" " the strategy is to lower the density of people in the high risk areas , " she added			1
" only those who have bulletproof vests , or houses that are sturdy , can stay in the firing line			0
" livelihoods ruined haiyan survivors also worry about their livelihoods , especially since many of the identified resettlement sites would take them far away from their places of work			1
@entity0 said she used to be a sales clerk at a warehouse near their house , but the store was forced to close after @entity5 , which triggered storm surges up to 10 meters high that ripped apart homes , commercial establishments and infrastructure			1
in @entity123 , eight cargo and passenger vessels slammed into houses , including @entity31 's			0
she said her family , together with her nine siblings and parents , ran to the highest location nearby and stayed there until the water subsided			0
" we ate anything we could to survive , " she said			0
" i remember seeing these ships smashing into the houses			0
" @entity0 's husband , who used to be a cargo handler at the pier , now works in one of the ships that ran aground in @entity12			0
he earns 250 pesos ( nearly $ 6 ) a day to help refloat the vessel that the new owner hopes to sail again			1
other ships have been chopped up and sold as junk			0
praying to endure the measly salary is not enough even for their small family , @entity0 said			0
" we have to buy everything here , from water for cooking and drinking , even water for taking a bath and washing clothes and wood for cooking , " she said			0
" we have to make do with what my husband earns daily , but my worry is what happens when the ship is gone and there is no more work			0
" @entity0 would love to work again , but she does n't have extra money to go out and prepare the usual requirements for employment			0
" i just pray to @entity171 that he gives us the strength to endure , " she said			0
we will survive this hardship			0

more than 70,000 live in coastal areas designated as danger zones in the @entity6
these areas were *ravaged* when @entity5 struck a year ago , killing thousands
only 250 residents have been relocated to permanent resettlement sites
the typhoon wiped out industries , making life a struggle for many survivors
