@entity0 , @entity1 -- the heads of state of @entity4 , @entity1 and four @entity6 partner nations signed a statement thursday opposing outside intervention in @entity9 and @entity10			1
" we believe any attempts to resolve the @entity10 issue by force are unacceptable , " the statement from the @entity12 read			2
" such attempts could lead to unpredictably serious consequences , which would threaten stability and security in the region and the entire world			0
" the heads of state of the other member nations , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , who attended the meeting hosted in @entity0 , also signed the statement			0
on @entity9 , the @entity12 statement was less blunt , calling for " dialogues that respect @entity9 's sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity			2
" but on wednesday , @entity4 president @entity35 and @entity1 president @entity36 had stronger words about @entity9 , once more presenting a united front on the crisis that stands in opposition to tough measures discussed by @entity43 powers			1
" both sides firmly oppose any attempt to resolve the @entity9 crisis through foreign military intervention as well as promoting forced ' regime change ' at the @entity50 and other venues , " the two presidents said			1
instead , they reiterated support for the mediation efforts of @entity50 special envoy @entity54 and called on all parties in the conflict to stop violence and engage in dialogue			0
as permanent members of the @entity50 , @entity1 and @entity4 have veto powers and are important players in the @entity9 conflict , having vetoed draft resolutions that called for sanctions against the @entity9 regime			1
in february , they vetoed a draft resolution calling on president @entity67 to step down , claiming it lacked balance			0
and last friday , they both vetoed a @entity50 resolution condemning last month 's massacre in @entity73			0
the vetoes drew criticism from the @entity9 opposition and @entity43 powers			2
pressure has been mounting on @entity1 and @entity4 to use their influence on @entity9 and join efforts led by the @entity82 to impose more sanctions on the @entity67 government and force it to step down			1
last tuesday , @entity82 secretary of state @entity86 urged @entity1 and @entity4 to be " part of the solution in @entity9 " by backing a political transition from the @entity67 regime			1
based on the tone of the joint statement , observers say it seems unlikely that @entity1 and @entity4 are going to change their positions on @entity9 anytime soon			2
this year , the @entity12 granted @entity98 " observer status " in its organization			0
in its closing statement , it called for the country to become " an independent , neutral , peaceful and prosperous nation			0
