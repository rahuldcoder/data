-- more than 20,000 confidential @entity2 documents will be released thursday identifying more than 1,000 leaders and volunteers banned from the group after being accused of sexual or inappropriate conduct with boys			1
the public release of the @entity10 ' 1,247 " ineligible volunteer files " from 1965 to 1985 will not contain the identities of the boy victims and witnesses			1
the national files are being distributed with the approval of the @entity16 by a law firm that won an $ 18.5 million judgment in 2010 against the @entity10 in a case where a scoutmaster sexually abused a boy			1
@entity22 , president of @entity23 , said the group is deeply committed to youth protection , but he acknowledged that in some cases , the organization 's response to allegations of abuse by volunteers " were plainly insufficient , inappropriate or wrong			1
" " where those involved in @entity35 failed to protect , or worse , inflicted harm on children , we extend our deepest and sincere apologies to victims and their families , " @entity22 said in a statement issued wednesday evening			1
" while it is difficult to understand or explain individuals ' actions from many decades ago , today scouting is a leader among youth - serving organizations in preventing child abuse			0
" police : couple hosted strip club , abused kids the @entity10 opposed the release of the internal records and said their confidentiality has encouraged prompt reporting of questionable behavior and privacy for victimized boys and their families			1
" while we respect the court , we are still concerned that the release of two decades ' worth of confidential files into public view , even with the redactions indicated , may still negatively impact victims ' privacy and have a chilling effect on the reporting of abuse , " the organization said			1
the @entity10 also released a september report from a @entity72 psychiatry professor , @entity71 , who concluded that the system " has functioned well in keeping many unfit adults out of @entity35			1
" but the attorneys representing victims in several lawsuits against the @entity10 say the group hid evidence from the public and police and that the so - called " perversion files " offer insight into what they deem a serious problem in the organization			1
the secrecy protected more than 1,000 suspected child molesters , said the attorneys , who will publicly release the documents during a news conference in a downtown @entity93 hotel			2
the attorneys are also seeking the release of post- 1985 files from the @entity10			1
victim to @entity97 : ' because of you , i trust no one ' the files will show that the expelled @entity2 leaders and volunteers -- all men -- " are sociopathic geniuses , " said attorney @entity106 of @entity93 , who has reviewed the 20,000 pages and is among the attorneys releasing the papers thursday			1
" they fool everybody , " he said			0
" and then they are able to coerce , convince or threaten these kids to stay silent			0
and you see that play out over and over again in the files			0
" @entity106 said he represents more than 100 men who as children were in the @entity10 , and he estimates that more than 50 % of his clients have drug or alcohol problems			2
at least three of them have committed suicide , he said			0
@entity125 , an attorney in @entity126 , said the abuse allegedly inflicted on the men as boys " has a corrosive effect " in which trust , relationship and sexuality issues develop with adulthood			0
one former boy scout represented by @entity125 , @entity137 , joined the group at 12 , recruited by an assistant scoutmaster who was a married firefighter with three children and led scout meetings in a church in @entity143			2
early , now 18 , was sexually abused by the scout leader while helping build a boy scout camp on his 42 - acre ranch , he said in an interview with @entity0			0
the assistant scoutmaster was convicted of abusing @entity137 and another boy and is now serving a prison sentence of 10 years to life			0
" i felt like i was all alone , " @entity137 said			0
" just thinking about it makes me angry ... because how could you do that to somebody ? how could you bring yourself to do that to somebody who is so innocent and has done nothing wrong ? " @entity159 volunteer gets 15 years for abuse the number of files started each year ranged from 25 to 75 at a time when about 5 million scouts and volunteers were active , according to @entity167 's report			1
in most cases , " police , courts and public were aware of the information in the files , " and 58 % " included information known to the public			1
" there were " a small number of files where an alleged offender was allowed back into scouting after offending , " often after psychiatric treatment , " those cases were extraordinarily rare , " wrote @entity167 , who was an expert witness for the @entity10 during the court case			1
@entity184 , a @entity185 , @entity186 , attorney who 's representing allegedly abused scouts who are now adults , said the released documents could provide information about possible pedophiles			1
" we 're talking about hundreds , if not thousands , of unidentified men who should be registered sex offenders who are roaming free in society , free to volunteer with other youth organizations , to work at schools and that sort of thing , " @entity184 said			0
the @entity10 disputes that characterization of their files			1
in a september 20 statement released by the @entity10 , @entity167 rebutted the characterization that the documents were " secret files of hidden abuse " by pedophiles			1
" the files show a significant amount of public knowledge of the offenders and their unlawful acts			1
for example , over 60 % of the files being made available to the public include some kind of public information			1
these public domain sources included newspaper articles , police reports , criminal justice records , and records of civil litigation			1
the majority of men in the files were arrested at some point in their lives for a sex crime , " @entity167 wrote			0
scouts study says kids safer with them than at home the files are also " very limited in their ability to answer important research questions about sexual abuse , " she said			2
" while some have attempted to categorize these files as a ' treasure trove ' of information about pedophiles and their actions , that simply is not the case , " @entity167 said			2
" these files tell us precisely what researchers already knew , and have known for many years : some small number of men will use a position of trust and access to young people to pursue illegal sexual gratification			0
this is a sad reality that has been with us throughout human history			0
" the @entity10 say they have improved their youth protection policies the past decade and have initiated such practices as third - party , computerized background checks on all new adult volunteers			1
also , at least two adults are present at all scouting activities , the group said			0
the @entity10 , founded by congressional charter in 1910 , instituted character reference checks for scoutmasters in 1911 and , by the 1920s , began using an ineligible volunteers list deemed not having " the moral , emotional or character values for membership , " the group said			1
opinion : what scout abuse scandal teaches us in june , the @entity16 upheld a lower - court decision to release the documents as requested by media outlets			0
" the court had discretion to order , on good cause shown , the release of those documents subject to the redaction of names set out in the exhibits to protect victims of child sexual abuse and reporters of child sexual abuse from embarrassment , retaliation or other harm , " the state @entity16 said in its order			1
" the court in this case properly exercised that authority			0
" the media companies seeking the release of the files were the @entity307 , the @entity308 newspaper in @entity93 , @entity309 , @entity310 ( a @entity0 affiliate ) , the @entity311 and @entity312			2
those media outlets intervened in a 2010 lawsuit in @entity315 that resulted in the largest judgment against the @entity10 in a molestation case			2
that year , an @entity315 jury found the @entity10 liable for the sexual abuse of a 12 - year - old boy more than 25 years earlier , returning a verdict of $ 18.5 million in punitive damages			2
catholic bishop convicted of shielding abuser the plaintiff , @entity325 , then 38 , allowed his name to be used publicly during the trial , according to his attorneys			0
he was among six men suing the @entity10 over allegations of sexual abuse			2
@entity325 ' attorney , @entity106 , produced documents during the six - week trial that he said were part of an archive of previously secret @entity2 files chronicling decades of abuse of boys			0
@entity106 said that when his clients were boys during the 1980s , the @entity10 knew that at least one of them had been abused by a former assistant scoutmaster			2
at the time of the 2010 trial , that former assistant scoutmaster was a 53 - year - old convicted sex offender released from prison in 2005 and paroled until 2013			0
@entity106 also alleged that though the scout leader was removed , he was allowed to stay on as a volunteer and the abuse continued			0
in 1983 , the assistant scoutmaster told troop leaders he abused 17 scouts , according to plaintiff 's attorneys			2
in its verdict , the jury held the @entity23 60 % negligent ; the @entity357 , which oversees scouting activities in the region , 15 % negligent ; and the @entity360 25 % negligent			0
the church has sponsored a number of @entity2 troops , including the one to which the plaintiff belonged			0
a lawyer representing the church said then that the verdict had no impact on the church , because it settled the case out of court more than a year earlier			0
