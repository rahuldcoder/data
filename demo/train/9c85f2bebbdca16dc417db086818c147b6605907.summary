accidentally brought your marijuana to the @entity3 / @entity2 ? do n't worry			0
@entity2 sheriff @entity4 plans to install amnesty boxes at the airport , possibly as soon as next week , for people traveling out of state			2
" we 'll have signs around the airport saying that although marijuana is legal in this state , it may be illegal in your final destination , " @entity4 told @entity9			1
" this is an opportunity to dispose of your marijuana with no legal consequences			0
" but do n't try to fly with that marijuana , not even departing from the pot - happy states of @entity24 and @entity25			1
both states allow adults 21 and older to have up to an ounce of marijuana , but those policies are at odds with federal law			2
leave the brownies at home , too -- even in states where it 's legal , it 's not yet clear how marijuana - laced food is evaluated under those limits			1
the @entity42 seized 36 ounces of marijuana - laced food in a passenger 's checked luggage at the @entity3 airport earlier this month , and the federal agency referred the case to the @entity48 , @entity41 confirmed			1
( the edibles ' amount of @entity51 , the active ingredient in cannabis , was much less than the weight of the food			0
the sheriff 's office declined to press charges			0
) the story was first reported in the @entity59			0
@entity24 's recreational marijuana stores make history in fact , the @entity42 has called the sheriff several times over the past six months to report passengers carrying marijuana and related products , @entity4 said			1
his office offers to dispose of the product before passengers depart the state			1
" most everybody heeds our warnings , " he said			0
the larger conflict is between state and federal law			0
while @entity24 and @entity25 allow some marijuana use , federal law has n't changed			1
and it 's probably not a good idea to test the @entity42 or other federal agencies at the nation 's airports			2
if they find a substance that violates federal law , they can refer possible violations to federal , state or local law enforcement in any state			0
still , pot is n't exactly the @entity42 's top priority			2
@entity91 bans pot despite @entity24 's new marijuana law " @entity42 's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers , " @entity42 spokesman @entity94 wrote in a statement			1
" @entity42 's screening procedures , which are governed by federal law , are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers			1
as has always been the case , if during the security screening procedures an officer discovers an item that may violate the law , @entity42 refers the matter to law enforcement			2
law enforcement officials will determine whether to initiate a criminal investigation			0
" it can be hard to sort out the competing state and federal regulations , especially for the dazed and confused passenger			0
the @entity121 airport has already placed amnesty boxes for people to get rid of their marijuana before clearing security or getting on an airplane			0
the @entity91 decided not to play with pot , banning the substance entirely at the airport , a spokeswoman confirmed			1
@entity131 does n't ban legal amounts of marijuana at the airport			1
that 's because @entity25 state law does n't allow facilities to add any additional regulation , airport spokesperson @entity135 said			1
a word of caution to @entity143 fans from @entity24 and @entity25 : do n't try to take your marijuana to less pot - friendly states			1
we know your ( possible ) cannabis consumption wo n't get in the way of the game , but consider where the @entity143 is being played			0
if your pot makes it to your destination , you could be dealing with the @entity155 and police guarding @entity158 and @entity159 airports in @entity160 and @entity162 airport in @entity163			2
how do you think will they react if your goods are discovered ? " if they 're possessing contraband in @entity160 or @entity163 , " @entity155 spokesman @entity166 said , " the prevailing laws would apply			0
" recreational pot sales : where the grass is much greener			0
