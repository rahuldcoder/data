-- repeat after me : " flower sir ? " now say it again -- 341 times			0
@entity4 must have been on the verge of tears after director and actor @entity7 made her perform one scene -- in which she says just two words in a silent film -- an excruciating 342 times			1
to be fair to @entity4 , she was not a professional actress , but a 20 - year - old socialite @entity7 had spotted in the crowd at a boxing match			1
the comedic legend , who defined the silent era with his trademark bowler hat , shuffling gait , and toothbrush mustache , had n't even spoken to @entity4 when he hired her as the love interest in one of his most successful movies of all time -- 1931 's " @entity26			1
" " @entity7 was a perfectionist , the king of the re-take , " said @entity27 , historian and author of " @entity7 's @entity29 and the @entity30			1
" " this was just a three minute sequence in the finished film , " he added			0
" but he took her to task -- even though it was a silent film			0
" now for the first time we can see the making of the memorable scene -- in which blind flower girl @entity4 mistakes @entity7 the tramp for a wealthy man -- in rare behind - the - scenes footage released by film archive the @entity50			1
watch the scene here practice makes perfect it 's a remarkable insight into the @entity56 - winning comedian 's work ethic , perhaps better known for his iconic role as the loveable " @entity58 , " than director			1
" he was a one man show -- not only was he the director , he was the writer , he was the producer			0
when music came in , he was a composer too , " said @entity27 , who narrates the flickering black - and - white footage			1
in a career spanning 75 years -- from @entity68 to 1950s @entity69 -- @entity7 became one of the most recognizable screen stars in the world , negotiating a $ 670,000 film deal when he was just 26 , a phenomenal amount at the time			2
it was not uncommon for @entity7 to re-do one scene 10 or 20 times			1
but 342 ? " this was extraordinary even by his standards , " said @entity27			0
why so many attempts at such a seemingly simple scene ? " @entity7 rehearsed on film -- he 'd try out an idea and do it over and over again , " explained @entity27			1
" and since he was the director , he could n't see his performance so he had to record it			0
" at the time , sound had also started to come into movies , and @entity7 worried " @entity26 " would be his last silent film -- he wanted to make it a masterpiece			1
as producer , he invested all his own money into the film -- had it been a flop , it could have destroyed him			0
luckily , it turned out to be a box office success			0
rags to riches growing up in an impoverished @entity103 home -- his mother was committed to a mental asylum , his alcoholic father died from liver failure -- @entity7 spent his early years in orphanages			2
" he identifies his mother as his greatest influence , " said @entity27			0
" as a child , they would sit in their apartment and she would mimic all the people who were walking down the street			0
" it 's no coincidence that " @entity26 " is about a blind woman -- a lot of @entity7 's heroines have a physical disability , which comes back to his mother			1
" cut ! after joining various theatre troupes as a teenager , @entity7 was taken on by the prestigious @entity121 comedy company			0
he toured @entity122 , gaining the attention of @entity124 -- and launching his career on the big screen			0
he became the master of physical comedy , with his exaggerated facial expressions , silly walks , and bumbling demeanor influencing generations of slapstick artists ; from @entity134 to @entity135 , and mr @entity136			0
yet despite his blundering on - screen persona , @entity7 was also disciplined director			2
watch this : meet the world 's greatest clown " he was very tough on set , " said @entity27			0
" he knew exactly what he wanted and he would have preferred not to have any other actors in his films -- he even tried making a film once where he was the only person in it			0
" it was a style @entity152 apparently struggled with on the set of @entity7 's 1967 film " a countess from @entity156			1
" " @entity152 was a method actor and really wanted to understand what his character was feeling			2
he said to @entity7 : ' i do n't understand my character 's motivation in this scene , ' and @entity7 said : ' forget about motivation , just do it as i tell you to do it , that 's your motivation , ' " said @entity27			1
time capsule after leaving the @entity122 in the 1950s and moving to @entity171 with wife @entity172 -- the couple remained married until his death in 1977 and had eight children -- @entity7 ordered many of his outtakes to be destroyed			2
" we 're very lucky to have this " @entity26 " footage , " said @entity27			2
" it was shot by his friend @entity180 , who committed suicide not long after , and certainly @entity7 would not let anyone else , other than his brother , film on set			2
