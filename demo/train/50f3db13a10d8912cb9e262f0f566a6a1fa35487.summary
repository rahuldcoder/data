the testimonies , one after another , have been damning , disturbing and , at points , excruciating			2
a @entity4 prison camp survivor told of a pregnant woman in a condition of near - starvation who gave birth to a baby -- a new life born against all odds in a grim camp			1
a security agent heard the baby 's cries and beat the mother as a punishment			2
she begged him to let her keep the baby , but he kept beating her			2
with shaking hands , the mother was forced to pick up her newborn and put the baby face down in water until the cries stopped and a water bubble formed from the newborn 's mouth			2
it 's just one example of the kind of testimony heard during an 11 - month inquiry into alleged violations of human rights in @entity4 , and documented in a report released by the @entity37 @entity36 on monday			1
the commission concluded that @entity4 has committed crimes against humanity			1
the commission investigated issues regarding the right to food , prison camps , torture and inhuman treatment , arbitrary detention , discrimination , freedom of expression , the right to life , freedom of movement , and enforced disappearances , including abductions of other citizens			1
the panel reported a stunning catalog of torture and the widespread abuse of even the weakest of @entity4 that reveal a portrait of a brutal state " that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world			1
" it remains to be seen what impact the report might have and whether @entity70 , a member of the @entity68 and staunch ally of @entity4 , will block action seeking human rights redress			1
collection of evidence since its creation last year , the commission of inquiry has examined satellite imagery , evidence and testimonies from more than 100 victims , witnesses and experts regarding @entity4			1
some of the testimonies were held confidentially because of protection concerns for family still remaining in @entity4			1
international attention on @entity4 has previously focused on halting its nuclear weapons program , but , in response to increasingly detailed reports of human rights abuses emerging from the isolated state , the @entity37 's @entity85 elected in march to establish the commission			1
for many @entity4 who testified , it was an acknowledgment of the sufferings they endured living and fleeing the regime			1
@entity4 is said to practice " guilt by association " -- punishing members of a person 's family and succeeding generations for one person 's perceived misdeeds			1
@entity106 has refused to cooperate with the investigation and rejects the commission 's validity			1
the commission of inquiry requested access to @entity4 and also invited its authorities to examine its evidence and also contribute in the process			1
in may 2013 , @entity4 sent a letter saying it " totally and categorically rejects the @entity36 " and has not answered subsequent letters , said @entity117 , the chair of the @entity37 @entity36			1
the commission comprises three appointees , chaired by @entity117 , a former @entity121 high court judge , along with @entity122 of @entity123 and @entity124 of @entity125			2
through its official news agency , @entity126 , @entity4 in august condemned the hearings as a " charade " to " hear testimonies from human scum			1
" a life in imprisonment throughout public hearings held in @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 , former @entity4 told of torture and imprisonment for watching soap operas or trying to find food to sustain their families			1
many of them ended up in prison camps for crossing the border to @entity70 or for having family members who were suspect to the regime			2
the @entity4 prison camps have survived twice as long as @entity154 's @entity153 gulags and much longer than the @entity156 concentration camps			1
one witness said that young male inmates in @entity4 prison camps became so desperate for food they would eat live worms or snakes caught in the field to feel something in their stomachs			1
" because we saw so many people die , we became so used to it , " one prison camp survivor told the commission			2
" i 'm sorry to say that we became so used to it that we did n't feel anything			2
in @entity4 , sometimes people on the verge of dying would ask for something to eat			1
or when somebody died we would strip them naked and we would wear the clothes			0
those alive have to go on , those dead , i 'm sorry , but they 're dead			0
" @entity181 told the commission of her time in a @entity4 prison			1
she was sent there after being repatriated from @entity70			0
she befriended a young girl , named @entity188 and became like a sister to her			0
while they were forced to work in the fields , they were looking for a type of grass to eat , as their prison rations were not enough			0
" we finished our work and we were about to pick up this grass or the plant that we knew we could eat , " @entity196 told the commission			0
" and then the guards saw us , and he came running and he stepped on our hands and then he brought us to this place and he told us to kneel			0
" they were forced to eat the grass along with the root and the soil as punishment			0
@entity188 became increasingly sick with diarrhea after eating the soil			0
" there was nothing i could do , " @entity196 said			0
" i could not give her any medicine			0
and when she died , she could n't even close her eyes			0
she died with her eyes open			0
i cried my heart out			0
" she wrapped @entity188 's body in a plastic bag and the other prisoners buried her and about 20 other bodies from the prison on a hill			0
orphaned and homeless in @entity4 " we covered the hole with clumped and frozen earth , but after a week when we went to the tomb , it was gone , the bodies were not there			1
we felt strange when we were going up that hill			0
we later found out that the old man who was guarding the place had his dogs eat the bodies			0
he raised five dogs and the dogs were eating the heads and the body parts of dead bodies			0
" this is the reality of the @entity4 prison , @entity196 stated			2
she ended her testimony saying : " i am embarrassed , i am ashamed to be here			2
there are people dying but because i was so desperate to make ends meet for myself , i was not able to help and i 'm guilty of it			0
" " i live like a prisoner , the reason for my living , the reason that i had to come to @entity249 , in addition for my own freedom , is to survive and live on behalf of those who did n't make it			0
people died for no reason			0
to help their souls rest in peace i have to be accountable for their lives			0
