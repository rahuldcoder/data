-- @entity2 , @entity3 , weapons of mass destruction -- it 's easy to understand why these threats to global stability consistently make the headlines			1
but it does n't take a nuclear device to devastate countries			0
while the international community has mobilized to tackle global threats posed by terrorism and nuclear proliferation , hundreds of thousands of people have already been killed by conventional weapons that have largely been overlooked by headlines and policymakers			1
despite the immeasurable human suffering caused from @entity21 to the @entity22 by conventional weapons such as machine guns and grenade launchers , it has been an uphill battle to generate the international will to control and regulate this trade -- until now			1
after years of difficult negotiations , governments joined together to adopt the @entity30			1
the treaty , which enters into force this week , is the only global , legally binding defense against the irresponsible and largely unregulated international arms trade			1
i spent more than five years advising the @entity36 and the diplomats that drafted it , and the treaty has enjoyed widespread global support since the @entity41 adopted it in april 2013			0
indeed , only three countries opposed its adoption : @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
and it 's a good treaty			0
it 's not a perfect one , but for the first time , the estimated $ 85 billion annual trade will have clear rules : outright prohibition of some arms transfers , greater scrutiny over others and government obligations to consider whether a transfer would contribute to violations of international humanitarian law , human rights law or be used to commit gender - based violence before a transfer is granted			0
in short , the treaty represents a global foundation from which countries can build and adapt their own policies			0
and , by formalizing the global rules of the road to help prevent powerful weapons from falling into the hands of bad actors , the security of the @entity70 and our allies will be strengthened			1
so why is the @entity70 suddenly absent from the front lines of recent discussions to shape the treaty 's future ? to its credit , the @entity83 administration actively participated in treaty negotiations , demanding that the text meet @entity70 requirements , including that there be no change in @entity70 law			1
these concessions allowed the @entity70 to sign the treaty three months after it was opened for signature , and as a result the @entity70 maintained that it wanted to be part of the treaty and help plan for its future			1
yet at a meeting to discuss the future of the @entity30 last month in @entity101 , the @entity70 was conspicuously absent			1
the @entity83 administration said it skipped the gathering because it was protesting the decision not to allow all @entity70 civil society organizations and industry into the meeting			2
the @entity101 meeting was only open to those organizations that could demonstrate a record of actively promoting the @entity30 and supporting its objectives and purpose , preventing groups that have worked to try to undermine the treaty , such as the @entity114 , from admission			2
as a result , other governments are now questioning the depth of @entity70 commitment to the treaty			2
and while missing one meeting may not harm the @entity70 moving forward , its strong - arm tactics hardly seems constructive			2
insisting other governments give in to @entity70 demands and open the meeting to treaty opponents and nonsignatories alienates treaty supporters			2
after all , the treaty is no longer being negotiated -- after wednesday it is international law , and it is time to set the treaty up for success in the long term			0
of course , the @entity30 is far from a panacea -- it is not going to put an end to all global illicit arms transfers			0
but it will help states develop laws , regulations and good practice to inhibit illegal and irresponsible transfers and better regulate the legitimate flow of weapons to help reduce human suffering			0
the @entity70 reluctance to engage constructively is all the more disappointing because it has good practices and experiences on the arms trade to promote and share with other countries , and also , as the largest arms producer and exporter , its views and actions carry significant weight internationally			0
this treaty has been years in the making , and will help address an issue that is far too often overlooked			0
the @entity70 should therefore embrace the leadership platform -- something it ca n't do from the sidelines .			1
