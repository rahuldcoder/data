something incredible is happening this week in @entity1			1
people in more than 170 communities -- from @entity4 to @entity5 -- are planning to hold public " @entity7 " rallies in honor of survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence			1
for the state with the highest rape rate in @entity14 , that 's a massively important undertaking			1
it sends a message to people in the state and across the country that silence is the poison that lets rape and sexual violence continue			1
" we have extremely high rates of domestic violence and sexual violence in @entity1 , " said @entity24 , a senior policy adviser to the governor			1
" when victims and survivors see their communities standing up for them , they see a great deal of strength			2
... and they see help , when they may not have ever sought help before			2
" it 's a topic about which i care a great deal -- and i know you do , too			2
@entity45 readers voted for me to cover rape in the @entity14 as part of my @entity49 project			1
after spending more than two weeks in @entity1 , i published a series of stories about why the rates of sexual violence are so shockingly high there -- and what could be done to change that			1
my biggest takeaway : people have to talk about this difficult issue			2
otherwise , too many victims who come forward are n't believed			2
and too many suffer in silence , thinking they 're to blame for what 's happened to them			0
they 're not alone , and these " @entity7 " rallies are just the sort of awareness - raising events that could push @entity1 off the bottom of the list			1
the demonstrations -- which are coordinated by the office of @entity1 's @entity73 governor , @entity72 , and are sponsored by the state -- started in 2010 with only 18 communities participating , @entity24 told me			1
this year , she expects more than 170 communities			1
the rallies start thursday and will continue through the weekend in some locations			0
i hope @entity45 readers will join the state in demanding an end to the violence there and elsewhere			1
take a photo of yourself with a sign that says " @entity86 " and upload it to @entity87 , @entity88 or @entity89 with the hashtag # chooserespect			1
the images will appear on this page -- and maybe in future coverage			2
@entity72 invited me to march with him in @entity1 on thursday			1
in a february 24 letter , he called @entity45 's coverage of rape in @entity1 " exceptional " and said it " pulled back the curtain and cast a new light on the issue " of sexual violence			1
i 'm unable to attend , but i appreciate the invitation			0
as for his kind words about the series , @entity45 shares the credit with the brave people in @entity1 who told me their stories -- and with the dozens of readers and viewers who shared their stories of survival in solidarity with @entity1			1
you can read some of those harrowing and heartfelt accounts on this page : " we are the 59 %			0
" fifty - nine percent of women in @entity1 face intimate partner or sexual violence in their lifetimes , including threats of violence			1
that statistic should horrify every @entity14			1
and it should provoke action , as it already has for many			0
after the series , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and others took up the issue , too			0
on thursday , as thousands of @entity1 are marching , my thoughts will be with all the incredible people i met on my trip to the state in december and those who shared their stories online			1
they will be with the people of @entity141 , @entity1 , which is one of a reported 75 communities that do not have any local law enforcement presence			1
a @entity45 reader started a petition asking the state government to change that			0
to date , i 'm told that request has not been heeded			0
people there do not have access to the same level of justice as elsewhere in this nation			0
unless geography determines a person 's worth , that should change immediately			0
" where are the boots on the ground in our village ? " asked @entity159 , principal of the school in @entity141 and one of many people there who wants a local officer			0
currently , state troopers usually must fly in from other villages to respond to emergencies -- a process that takes 45 minutes at best and sometimes , in bad weather , can take days			2
the state troopers have told me they 're having difficulty finding someone who would take the job in @entity141			0
it 's a tough economy these days , and i 've been told funding is available for the position			0
if you 'd like to apply , e-mail me ( ctl@cnn.com ) and put " @entity141 " in the subject line			0
i 'll be happy to connect you to the troopers			0
my thoughts will be with the young people who helped organize a panel discussion in @entity4 called " @entity188 " -- part of a national awareness - raising campaign			1
and , finally , my thoughts will be with @entity191 , a victim of child sexual assault from @entity193 who , i 'm told by a local lawmaker , will be traveling @entity1 this week campaigning for a bill that would require state school districts to teach about the warning signs of child sexual abuse			1
currently , @entity1 does not require school districts to teach that essential information or sex education			2
the bill -- " @entity207 , " which has been passed in ten other states , according to the group 's facebook page -- is expected to come before the @entity209 education committee on friday			2
i hope her upcoming testimony will encourage legislators to push this bill forward			0
the lawmaker who proposed the legislation , rep. @entity215 , an @entity4 @entity216 , told me she 's optimistic it can pass this session			0
she handed out copies of my articles , again , which @entity45 readers commissioned , in hopes representatives will realize the scope of this problem			0
" it 's really been a good conversation starter , " she said of the stories			0
" there 's too much coverage ( for legislators to ignore sexual violence )			1
once you start to be in national press for this , that really is a catalyst for change			0
that 's not the kind of notoriety you want for the state			0
" i do n't want to paint @entity1 as an awful or isolated place			2
the stats are horrifying , as are many of the stories i heard			0
but sexual violence is a serious concern across the country , and states like @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 have rates of reported rape well above the national average			1
it does n't have to be this way			0
i will anxiously await photos from the " @entity7 " rallies			0
@entity1 is also a beautiful place full of strong people			2
and this week , all of us will get a chance to see them -- and , hopefully , you -- demanding a safer future .			2

@entity1 will rally this week in 170 communities to end sexual violence
join them by uploading a photo of yourself and tagging it # chooserespect
@entity279 recently featured @entity1 as part of his @entity49 project
@entity1 has the highest rate of reported rape in the country -- three times the @entity14 average
