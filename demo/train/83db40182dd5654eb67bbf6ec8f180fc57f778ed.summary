@entity0 -- ten years after its formation , the @entity2 on wednesday got the type of birthday card no one wants to receive -- a blistering report from @entity9 lawmakers who said the agency is " bloated " and " inefficient " and has done little , if anything , to improve aviation security			1
rep. @entity14 , @entity15 , a longtime critic who has fought to privatize @entity2 screening jobs , said @entity17 never intended the agency it created in november 2001 to " mushroom " into a workforce of 65,000 employees , " top heavy " with bureaucrats			1
" i can tell you , in our wildest dreams ... no one ever envisioned 4,000 administrative personnel in @entity0 , making on average ... almost $ 104,000 , and then nearly another 10,000 out in the field , " @entity14 said			1
but the most scathing comment came from rep. @entity32 , @entity33			1
" @entity34 have spent nearly $ 60 billion funding @entity2 and they are no safer today than they were before 9/11 , " @entity32 said			1
pressed on the accuracy of that statement , @entity32 and @entity14 said the @entity2 has never stopped a terrorist attack , and gave credit to private citizens or others for terrorist plots disrupted thus far			1
" unfortunately , the focus has been diverted from security ... into managing a huge bureaucracy , " @entity14 said			1
" we must focus on identifying terrorists and stopping them instead of patting down grandma and children			0
and we must stop worrying about political correctness , " he said			0
" @entity2 needs to put their resources into intelligence and technologies that can be more effective when it comes to catching highly elusive and dangerous terrorists			1
" the lawmakers said they are preparing legislation to reform the @entity2			1
a @entity2 spokesman called the @entity9 report " an unfortunate disservice to the dedicated men and women of @entity2 who are on the front lines every day protecting the traveling public			1
" the country 's aviation system is " safer , stronger , and more secure than it was 10 years ago , " spokesman @entity66 said			1
the agency has screened more than 5 billion passengers over the past decade , he said , and has prevented more than 1,100 guns from being brought onto passenger planes this year alone			0
@entity14 and @entity73 released the @entity9 report at a news conference held in the main concourse of @entity77 - @entity76			2
their remarks criticizing the state of aviation security were amplified over a loudspeaker , and drew sidelong glances from passengers headed to airport checkpoints			0
one day earlier , @entity2 administrator @entity86 stood in the same location to discuss holiday travel preparations , touting advancements in screening technology and saying passengers are happy with changes that have reduced the number of pat downs of children			2
the report released wednesday was prepared by @entity9 staffers on @entity98 and oversight committees			0
it is largely a compendium of earlier critical reports of the @entity2 , looking at its deployment of failed technology , such as puffer machines ; the failure to interdict terrorists , such as 2001 " shoe bomber " @entity109 and 2009 " underwear bomber " @entity110 " ; and the lack of card readers for the 1.8 million id cards issued to transportation workers			2
the report says the agency has grown nearly four-fold since its inception , from 16,500 workers to more than 65,000 , while commercial passenger traffic has increased less than 12 percent			0
but a @entity2 spokesman said the agency had approximately 56,000 security officers in 2002 , the year it started screening , and has approximately 52,000 today			1
the report by the @entity9 contains 11 recommendations , saying the @entity2 must act with greater independence from the @entity127 , and the administrator 's stature must be elevated			2
the @entity2 has become " lost " in the @entity127 bureaucracy , @entity14 said			1
it also calls on the agency to contract out more screening jobs to private industry			0
currently , 16 airports , including @entity135 , have " opted out " of federal airport screening and use private screeners under what is known as the @entity139			0
the screeners wear the same uniforms , use the same technology and follow the same procedures			0
@entity14 advocates the continued privatization of airport screening jobs , but administrator @entity146 has been less supportive , at one point saying he would expand the program only if there was a clear advantage to doing so			2
in other @entity2 news , a travel industry group wednesday said the agency 's screening procedures remain " inefficient and frustrating " for travelers			1
the @entity157 released the results of an online survey it conducted last month of about 600 people			0
according to the survey , " four of the top five air traveler frustrations relate to the checkpoint process , " including the top frustration : " people who bring too many carry - on bags through the security checkpoint			0
" but five of the 11 options on the survey pertained directly to @entity2 checkpoints , and the remaining options did not include some common irritants , such as excess baggage fees			2
the survey says 66.2 percent of air travelers are " somewhat or very satisfied " with the @entity2 's overall performance as it relates to security , 21.2 percent are neutral , and 12.5 percent are " somewhat or very dissatisfied			2
" but frequent air travelers are less happy , with 54.6 percent " somewhat or very satisfied			0
" the group said that despite the @entity2 's new initiatives to improve passenger screening , an " overwhelming majority " have not recognized any improvements in checkpoint efficiency when compared to the previous year			0
it said 81.8 percent plan to arrive at the airport the same amount of time before a flight as they did last year			0
the survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent			0
the @entity2 said it was pleased to see the vast majority of travelers polled believe the agency is moving in the right direction , and said checkpoint screening has gotten speedier , taking less than 20 minutes for more than 99 percent of passengers last year			1
" the increased number of carry - on bags impacts our ability to further reduce wait times , but not the level of security we provide , which remains our priority , " the agency said .			0

the @entity2 is top heavy , rep. @entity14 says
@entity34 " are no safer today " than before 9/11 , rep. @entity32 says
@entity2 spokesman : the agency is " safer , stronger , and more secure than it was "
