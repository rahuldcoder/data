-- they have come to glimpse the miracle			2
they have come to witness the revolution			2
they have come for " watchmen " -- the allegedly unfilmable superhero movie , the long - awaited adaptation of the comic book that changed the face of comic books forever			1
@entity12 plays dr. @entity13 , a powerful superhero in " @entity6			1
" on this warm july morning , over 5,000 fans attending the annual geek pop summit known as @entity18 have assembled inside the @entity19 for a first look			2
many spent the night on the sidewalk			2
some have come in costumes			2
behind the stage , indie - movie icon @entity26 parks himself in front of a closed - circuit tv , a happy grin on his bearded mug			1
" you have to understand , i 've been waiting for this moment for years , " says @entity26			1
" this is it , man			2
" all this , for a violent , ironic superhero epic that does n't like superheroes in the first place			2
directed by " 300 's " @entity40 , " @entity6 " presents a set of familiar superhero archetypes -- and then subverts them completely			1
@entity44 ( @entity45 ) is like the spirit ... except he 's a joyless , hard - line misanthrope			2
the comedian ( @entity49 ) is like @entity50 ... but loyal only to sadistic thrills and a corrupt worldview			2
@entity53 ( @entity54 ) is part @entity55 , part @entity57 ... except he 's also a schlubby , impotent coward			2
@entity59 ( @entity60 ) is the resident genius ... who 's built an empire on superhero toys			2
( you see what we mean by irony			2
) says @entity12 , whose blue , naked dr. @entity13 is an almighty @entity73 dangerously detached from his own humanity : " ' @entity6 ' is a kind of thrilling thought experiment			1
what would people who dress up in costumes to fight crime actually be like ? well , they 'd probably be fetishists who lived on the fringes of society			2
they 'd all be a bunch of freaking lunatics			0
" yet for all its self - awareness and cynicism , " @entity6 " is n't some cheap - and - silly " @entity87 " parody			1
adapted faithfully , if not completely , from the celebrated 1986 comic - book series , @entity40 's film is visually and intellectually ambitious , filled with heady ruminations about savior figures , pop culture , and the politics of fear			1
at a time when superhero stories are commonplace and our shaken country is pinning its recovery on an idealistic new president , " @entity6 's " director believes his movie can serve as a bracing blast of healthy skepticism			1
" someone asked me if i thought that because @entity109 had been elected president , the movie was no longer relevant			1
i said , ' wow , that 's a very optimistic view of the future ! ' " says @entity40			0
" the movie , like the comic , says , ' these superhero stories you 've been feasting on ? what if we took them seriously ? ' ... that 's the fun			1
" but fun for whom ? when " @entity6 " hits theaters on march 6 , the comic - book cognoscenti will be there in droves -- although some are already sweating the heresy of dramatic changes			1
@entity0 : what did n't make it ? and , for mainstream moviegoers , such talk of " subverting superhero archetypes " is liable to elicit a great big " huh ? " @entity0 : a " watchmen " primer " @entity6 's " financial backers are clearly hoping the success of " @entity138 " has primed the market for sophisticated superhero films -- especially one that 's two hours and 41 minutes long			1
but where " @entity138 " transcended genre conventions , " @entity6 " wallows in them			1
created by writer @entity144 and artist @entity145 , " @entity6 " is most often praised as the comic book that brought respect and maturity to a medium long dismissed as juvenile			1
it was the fanboys ' " @entity151 " -- and maybe their first @entity153 , too			0
" i was 13 when i read ' @entity6 , ' and it came to represent my coming of age , " says " lost " co-creator @entity154			1
" i felt like ' @entity6 ' was this very , very bad thing that i should n't be reading , and if my mom caught me with it i 'd be f --- ing doomed			1
" @entity159 was similarly struck by " @entity6 , " but has been much less successful at avoiding the doom			1
in 1986 , @entity161 acquired the comic 's rights for producer @entity164 , but could never get an adaptation rolling			0
over the next decade , " @entity6 " bounced among many studios and between many before finding what appeared to be a happy ending at @entity170			1
but in 2005 , with helmer @entity172 deep into preproduction , a @entity170 regime change killed the project			0
certainly , it 's a hard project to get your head around			0
" @entity6 " is set in the year 1985			1
the @entity177 and the @entity178 are on the brink of nuclear war , and the president is @entity182 , whose success at ending the @entity184 ( he asked dr. @entity13 to blow up the @entity186 ) has earned him five terms of office from a grateful nation			0
conservative politics are popular , as are @entity192 fast food and pirate comics			0
but costumed heroes , once all the rage , are now outlawed			0
when the comedian gets murdered , @entity44 tries to round up his old allies to investigate			0
they eventually uncover an insidious conspiracy hatched by an unlikely villain , one whose grand ambition is n't world domination but something else altogether			0
ireport.com : will you watch ' @entity6 ' ? and that 's only half the comic			1
hence , " @entity6 's " rep as the @entity208			1
but tides changed in late 2005 when @entity210 acquired the property from @entity170 ( or at least they thought they did ) with the hope of rolling on " watchmen " asap			0
( @entity210 is a unit of @entity215 , as is @entity216 and @entity0			0
) the studio turned to @entity40			0
at that point , the director had only done stylish tv commercials and the 2003 zombie remake " @entity222			0
" but he was also deep in the middle of shooting the studio 's action epic " 300 , " another adaptation of a brilliantly brutal comic , and the execs liked what they were seeing			0
@entity40 's approach was simple : he would remain religiously faithful to the comic			0
" we treated that thing like a freakin ' illuminated text , " says the director , who embraced all the peculiar idiosyncrasies , from the @entity233 to the deep - dive digressions into character origin stories			0
( none of this faithfulness can please @entity144 , who feels that no adaptation can do his work justice and has taken his name off the film			1
) the director also believed that an " adult " superhero epic needed to be explicit about its " adult " content			0
he wanted to hear the characters ' philosophical musings			0
he wanted to see the blood spurt			0
and instead of the chaste kisses of most superhero movie romances , he wanted to see some naked getting - it - on			1
" i wanted to make sure everyone understood : this is not a kid movie , " says @entity40			1
and doing that with a @entity262 just dilutes that message			0
" and then there was the worry that all that effort was all for naught			0
last february , @entity161 sought to stop @entity210 from moving forward with " @entity6 's " release , claiming via lawsuit that @entity210 had not properly acquired the distribution rights			1
the dispute exploded in the media last august when a judge declared that @entity275 's lawsuit had merit			0
" how do you not know whether or not you have the right to make a movie ? " says @entity12			1
" but after months of intense press coverage that put " @entity6 " in the mainstream eye , the two studios reached a settlement			1
( @entity210 and @entity161 both declined to comment			0
as for producer @entity164 : " it was unfortunate , " he says simply			0
) now @entity6 " waits to see if any of that notoriety can help make them some money			1
with a $ 100 million - plus budget and a running time of 161 minutes , " @entity6 " will need to launch with a big opening weekend and strong reviews			1
so , will geek love -- and geek dollars -- be enough ? @entity40 hopes so			0
he says he made the film for that crowd			2
" i do n't think there ever has been a movie more custom - made for them			2
not at this scale , " he says			0
" and now they have an opportunity to really influence pop culture in a serious way , just as the comic influenced comics			2
they can say : ' these stories can be used to say something about the world			0
give us more of them			0
