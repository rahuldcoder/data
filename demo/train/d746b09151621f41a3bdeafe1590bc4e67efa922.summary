-- around the world , and in developing nations especially , there is an overwhelming demand for higher education			1
despite worldwide increases in tertiary enrolment numbers , there still remains disparity between those with access to quality education and those without			2
in @entity16 , for example , only 6 % of college - age students are enrolled in higher education			1
@entity18 : the world 's next economic powers do n't need the @entity21 that number rises to 72 % in @entity23 and @entity24 , but hovers around 20 % to 40 % for most developing regions , according to @entity27 reports			2
without higher education , most people face a grim future			1
but once you consider the possibilities provided by an internet connection and the growing availability of quality online education resources , the conversation about accessibility shifts from " where " to " how , " and exciting new opportunities ( and challenges ) arise			1
so how do we actualize the idea of education for everyone ? read more : does @entity44 deserve its ' b ' for @entity46 ? at @entity48 , only one - third of our students are from the @entity49 , and 40 % are from the developing world			1
not surprisingly , three of our biggest countries outside the @entity49 are @entity44 , @entity52 , and @entity53 , where the number of jobs that require a higher education greatly exceeds the number of people with education sufficient to do these jobs			1
in @entity53 , for example , new student enrollments rose 230 % since january 2013 ( surpassing new student growth from the @entity49 , which is up 178 % )			2
our large international growth poses challenges in dealing with cultural and language differences			0
the challenges despite our global reach , most of the course material and lectures found on our platform are in @entity73 , making the courses inaccessible to many students whose native language is not @entity73			0
to address this issue , we are taking a two pronged approach			0
first , we are working with our partner universities in @entity73 - speaking countries to offer courses taught natively in languages other than @entity73 ( currently @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87 )			0
more from @entity88 : top college courses , for free ? we are also building up a network of " translation partners " - non-profits , companies , and universities - to translate @entity48 lectures from popular courses into a selection of languages common among our students			1
reducing language barriers opens up new possibilities and applications of online education			1
experiments in global learning @entity107 - based @entity106 ( one of our translation partners ) has experimented with creative ways to use online education to transcend cultural and language barriers			1
the center for new technology and entrepreneurship recently hosted a multi-national " ideahack			0
" this interactive meet - up centered around the @entity120 's online @entity119 course , and attracted more than 200 live students from @entity107 and 15 students from three continents around the world via video conference , with the event being simultaneously translated for @entity53 and @entity73 audiences			2
@entity128 : how to beat inequality those attending worked in small groups applying principles learnt from professor @entity134 's @entity48 course			0
professor @entity134 participated virtually throughout the event			0
@entity138 's professor @entity137 taught his sociology class to a global audience			0
he says that : " within three weeks i had received more feedback on my sociological ideas than i had in a career of teaching , which significantly influenced each of my subsequent lectures and seminars			0
" these insights have reshaped the way he teaches his @entity138 students on campus			0
one student wrote to him , saying , " it has been an incredible experience for me , one that has not only taught me sociology , but the ways in which other cultures think , feel , and respond			0
" @entity159 : i just do n't see room for education cuts by their very nature , @entity163 ( @entity163 ) foster an open environment where people from all walks of life can contribute to a thriving collaborative community			0
translation of online courses further helps increase access to people from diverse backgrounds , and thereby enables the true globalization of education			2
other models for online education are also being explored , such as the flipped classroom , which makes high - quality course content available in conjunction with local instruction			1
this can provide much needed expansion of education in the many countries that lack qualified instructors			0
the future with the rise of online education , the notion of a " global classroom " is being discussed by educators and the media alike			1
to me , achieving a " global classroom " means using education to erase barriers between people of different cultures and backgrounds ; it means giving people the opportunity to learn without the limits imposed by physical or socio - economic circumstances ; and it means giving schools and instructors around the world the ability to transcend boundaries to bring high - quality education to their students			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity88 .			2

in @entity16 , 6 % of college - age students enroll in higher education
internet and the growing availability of quality online education can change this
