@entity0 -- around the world , hot air balloons are used to give tourists a spectacular view of the landscape , as well as for sport and private recreation			1
but , with 19 people dead after a hot air balloon crash in @entity10 , @entity11 , just how safe are they ? what are the basics of ballooning ? essentially a balloon is a nylon bag -- known as an envelope -- filled with hot air , which is created by burning liquid propane in a steel burner			1
more heat makes the balloon rise , less makes it descend			2
balloons fly in the direction of the wind			0
@entity27 described hot air ballooning as " man 's first form of flight			1
" the @entity32 invented it in 1793 and since then it has been developed for sport and tourist rides			1
balloons have also been used by the military			0
how safe is hot air ballooning ? until tuesday 's incident , the deadliest accident in recent memory happened in 1989 , when 13 people were killed as two hot air balloons collided in @entity44			1
@entity45 : after tragedy , vacationers recall glorious balloon rides in @entity11 @entity49 said while every activity had its risks , ballooning was " one of the safest means of flying in existence			1
" " you are floating in the air like a feather			2
you put some heat into the envelope to get you up and then you float with the atmosphere , there is no speed involved			0
" if the fuel ran out , a balloon could still be landed safely , he said			2
" it 's not like an airline crash			2
it 's like a huge parachute			0
if you do it [ descend ] wisely and if you do it in a controlled way you can come down with cold air in the envelope but it 's still inflated -- it 's still a big balloon			1
" @entity49 added that a fire on board was the most dangerous situation for a pilot because the only way to escape it was by jumping overboard			0
" if passengers are jumping the balloon is getting lighter -- it 's climbing again			2
it 's getting in a more dangerous situation because the higher you go the more dangerous it is to jump out			0
" @entity27 also said fire resulting from contact with power lines was probably the biggest risk for hot air balloonists			1
" if you 've hit a power line there is n't a fire extinguisher made that can put that out			0
" he pointed to a 2012 accident in @entity99 , in which 11 people died			2
" @entity99 was a wire contact and it had fatal results and that 's certainly the balloonist 's biggest worry , " he said			0
so what was the cause of the crash in @entity11 ? state - run @entity109 reported that a gas explosion caused the crash but @entity11 's government said a committee from the @entity114 would investigate			1
the government said the balloon was " flying at 300m [ about 900feet ] when it caught fire and exploded			2
" how safe is hot air ballooning in @entity11 ? the last hot air balloon accident in @entity10 happened in 2009 , when 16 foreign tourists were injured after a balloon struck a cell phone transmission tower			1
@entity27 described @entity11 as having " a rather chequered history " when it came to ballooning			1
the country had probably had more accidents than some others , he said , but on the other hand probably made more flights			0
" they 've probably had half a dozen serious accidents in the last five years			0
if that had happened in the @entity135 there would be a big hoo - ha about it			0
" but @entity49 said @entity11 operators carried a lot of passengers and flew on a daily basis and the @entity10 crash was " quite exceptional			1
" how is hot air ballooning regulated ? there is no body dealing with air ballooning regulations globally			1
around the world , 191 countries are members of the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) , the @entity152 body that issues advice on aviation standards and regulations			1
but @entity27 said there was no legal obligation to comply with the @entity150 's @entity158 ( @entity159 )			0
the @entity150 's recommendations were " sufficiently broad to always need local interpretation , " he said , adding that this was where " things get difficult			0
" " the regulations are pretty similar in every country			0
the question in each different country is to what extent are those regulations enforced , " @entity27 said			0
" the @entity11 civil aviation authority is in ultimate charge of what goes on in anything to do with civil aviation in @entity11			1
" @entity27 said in @entity135 , for example , pilots had to sit regular medical tests and assessments and balloons were checked after every 100 hours of flight			0
he said @entity11 had a similar system but that it was " somewhat less independently supervised			2
" how have @entity11 authorities reacted to the crash ? @entity11 's @entity184 has stopped all ballooning in the country since tuesday 's accident			1
but @entity27 said a blanket ban did n't solve the problem			0
" that kind of knee jerk reaction is symptomatic of the way such problems are approached , " he said			0
in @entity135 , he added , the authorities would look at a particular set of circumstances rather than shutting down everything			2
@entity10 balloon disaster ' blow ' for @entity11 tourism			1

hot air ballooning began in @entity32 , in 1793
nineteen people were killed in a hot air balloon crash in @entity10 , @entity11 , tuesday
there is no global body to regulate *commercial* hot air balloon operations
countries regulate hot air ballooning through their own civil aviation authorities
