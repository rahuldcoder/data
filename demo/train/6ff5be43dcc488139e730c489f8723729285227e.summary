tensions in @entity1 , @entity2 , have simmered since black teen @entity3 was shot and killed by a white police officer in august			1
and with a grand jury expected to soon deliver its decision on whether to indict the officer , a group that represents protesters says it wants 48 - hours notice before the decision is announced so it can help prevent the @entity12 suburb from once again boiling over with anger , violence and confusion			1
a group of community members calling themselves the @entity18 this week released 19 " @entity19 " that touch on major points of contention between protesters and police since @entity3 's august 9 killing			1
witnesses said @entity3 , who was unarmed , had his hands in the air as if surrendering , when he was shot			2
authorities said @entity3 attacked the officer			1
dueling narratives in @entity3 shooting ' prepare for the worst ' @entity1 mayor @entity32 told local media this week that authorities must " prepare for the worst " and he expects demonstrations across the area			1
he and his administration did n't respond to @entity39 's inquiries about whether city officials would agree to the coalition 's requests			2
@entity1 police also did not respond to @entity39 's questions about what that department thinks of the " rules , " but @entity49 police said their department " endorses the statement from the @entity51 regarding the sanctity and preservation of human life			1
to that end , and in the spirit of building communications , members of the @entity57 have met with the coalition to define common goals			0
" many protesters were furious because they feel @entity3 's killing was an example of excessive use of force			1
they and heavily armed law enforcement clashed in the streets for days after @entity3 's death			1
authorities , who drove armored vehicles and wore military gear , were roundly criticized by members of the media , other law enforcement officials and demonstrators for escalating the violence , rather than tempering it			0
law enforcement also was accused of blocking and , in some cases , attacking journalists who were trying to report on the situation			0
@entity83 issues no - fly zone over @entity1 19 ' @entity19 ' some of the coalition 's " rules " ask that police provide information that makes clear law enforcement 's chain of command , who is making what decisions and why , and assurances that neither police nor the government will interfere with the flow of information			2
that means , according to the " rules , " there will be no unwarranted wiretapping or attempts to interfere with internet and cellular access			0
the rules ask the police not to use rubber bullets , armored vehicles , rifles and tear gas			0
the organization also has written stipulations about how it wants police to present themselves , including a request that officers wear attire " minimally required for their safety " and that " specialized riot gear will be avoided except as a last resort			0
" @entity123 would not give details on law enforcement 's plan following the grand jury 's decision , @entity39 affiliate @entity122 reported wednesday			1
but he spoke in broad terms about the approach law enforcement is going to take			0
" it 's not going to be about lining up a fixed line of law enforcement officers somewhere , it 's going to be about being prepared , being reactive , being mobile , being able to respond to wherever an issue breaks out , " the mayor said			2
@entity32 also expects there 's going to be unrest outside of @entity1			1
" it 's not going to be about @entity1 , " he said			2
" the threats that are out there are threats across the region			0
our expectation is that demonstrations will probably break out in several places			1
" the mayor told @entity122 2 that people who are close to organizers and protesters have informed him that demonstrators are planning to focus on areas around @entity12 and the city 's downtown			2
area school superintendents have written a letter urging that when the grand jury comes to a decision that it be announced on a weekend or at least not on a weekday until after 5 p.m. the superintendents are concerned that if chaos happens , that could affect the ability of nearly 20,000 students who use transportation to get to and from school			1
if violence breaks out in @entity1 , people who live there wo n't be behind it , @entity32 told @entity122 2			1
" i think you have to prepare for the worst , but i think we all hope the best out of people , " @entity32 said			2
" i do n't believe that there is even a small fraction of residents in the city of @entity1 who want to do any damage or harm to any other residents or to any businesses ... the concern would be who comes ( from ) outside the area			0
" opinion : @entity1 : the signal it sends about @entity191 are the ' rules ' legal ? do n't shoot @entity51 co-chair @entity194 said the purpose of the group 's proposed rules is to " de-escalate violence " without tamping down on peaceful protest action			1
" what we 're trying to do is make sure that we move everything into a constructive way to create change , " he said			0
@entity39 legal analyst @entity205 and radio personality @entity206 , appearing on @entity39 on thursday , praised the idea of community members working with law enforcement to avoid a repeat of the chaos that raged in august and september			0
" it 's been done in mass demonstrations in the past -- marches on @entity215 , for civil rights , protesting the @entity217 , " he said			2
opinion : what does justice mean for @entity1 ? @entity205 was skeptical that the police would -- or should -- agree to some of the rules , including those that govern what police can wear and when they can make arrests			0
one rule states : " police will be more tolerant of more minor lawbreaking such as thrown water bottles when deciding whether to escalate the use of force			0
" " when you 're out on the street and there 's a huge street demonstration which could go violent immediately , you have to be prepared for that , " @entity205 said			0
" what are they going to do ? go change ? if you 're a cop you have to protect yourself from things being thrown at you			0
" in the days after @entity3 's shooting , @entity206 noted that the police looked like " they were going to war			1
" " and that 's what made the protesters feel that heightened ( fear ) ... because of the way the police were speaking to them , " she said			0
as far as being notified 48 hours ahead of a grand jury verdict , @entity205 said that was legal and could be done , though it would be an unusual step			1
" i ca n't find any cases where the judiciary , which runs the grand jury , gave advance notice to street demonstrators about when an indictment was going to come down , " @entity205 said			1
" on the other hand , it 's not illegal , so theoretically , it could be done			0
