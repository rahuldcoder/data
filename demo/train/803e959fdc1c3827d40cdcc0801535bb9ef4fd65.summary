@entity0 -- while @entity3 waits for regulatory approval on its bid to acquire @entity6 , company executives have repeatedly worked to assuage partners ' fears that the @entity10 software developer is preparing to compete with them			1
partners in @entity3 's mobile - phone venture were understandably skeptical when the @entity10 maker said this summer that it planned to acquire one of their rivals , creating a potential reason to roll out improvements to its popular smartphone operating system on @entity6 phones before offering them to others			1
@entity3 has offered free and open - source versions of @entity10 to anyone ambitious enough to download it and tinker with the code			1
dozens of smartphone and tablet makers have taken @entity3 up on this , and have come to rely on it for their businesses			2
@entity3 , which assured them it is focused on software , not hardware , seemed like a logical partner			0
then , when the company 's intentions to buy @entity6 surfaced , @entity3 execs said they were mainly doing so in order to protect themselves and their partners against patent litigation			1
( @entity6 has about 24,000 patents either approved or pending )			0
the $ 12.5 billion acquisition still has not cleared federal oversight , and so @entity3 has not been talking publicly much about its plans			2
a spokesman declined to comment on the matter last week			0
since @entity1 's inquiries , @entity3 chairman @entity48 has been discussing some plans for @entity6 on a three - city tour of @entity53 this week			1
he told an audience in @entity55 on tuesday that the acquisition will " not change in any material way the way we operate , " and then told a group in @entity57 , @entity58 , on wednesday that @entity3 plans to continue providing legal defenses to @entity10 partners , according to @entity61			1
@entity67 cto @entity66 said at a conference last week that @entity3 still maintains it is buying @entity6 primarily for the patent portfolio of one of the world 's oldest mobile - phone companies			1
" the last thing they would like to happen is to create a vertical , because that would destroy the market share for @entity10 , " he said onstage at the @entity73 here on thursday			2
@entity3 led the market in the most recent quarter , thanks in part to wide adoption by many companies , with 43 % of smartphone owners using @entity10 phones , according to research firm @entity87			1
@entity88 and blackberry - maker @entity89 operate vertical businesses in which they maintain and control their own hardware and software			1
in the nearly three months since announcing a bid for @entity6 , the strategy to remain a neutral player " has been clearly communicated to us by @entity3 , and it makes sense , " @entity66 said in an interview			1
" we are an all - @entity10 company now , " @entity66 said			0
" we do not hesitate to be an @entity10 company			0
" even with @entity6 's help , @entity3 could struggle to transition from a software developer to bringing hardware products to market , @entity66 said			1
" @entity3 is a great software company , but they are not a consumer brand , " he said			0
@entity3 has suggested that it plans to leverage @entity6 's hardware expertise in order to understand how to integrate software more closely with hardware , @entity107 , the senior vice president for @entity109 products , said in an interview			1
patents are perhaps secondary in terms of how the acquisition will benefit partners , he said			0
" i would n't say that it 's black and white about wanting to be vertical , " @entity107 said			2
" @entity3 needs the capability to understand how to deeply integrate with the hardware			0
" that could turn @entity6 , a storied mobile innovator , into a glorified research - and - development arm			2
in the meantime , @entity6 is laying off 800 of its 19,000 workers , and the company is preparing to launch the @entity128 , the spiritual successor to one of the most popular phones of the last decade			0
not surprisingly , the new version runs on @entity10			0
even more so than @entity6 , @entity109 has been very close with @entity3 over the last two years			2
the pair has twice partnered for what 's called the " lead device program , " in which @entity3 and a hardware maker collaborate on the first product that will run a major new version of @entity10			1
together , they developed the @entity141 and the upcoming @entity142			0
@entity3 has also worked with @entity143 for the @entity144 and @entity6 for the @entity146 tablet			2
being chosen as the lead - device partner is a competitive advantage , @entity149 said , because the company gets direct access to @entity3 engineers and to @entity10 code before rivals			2
@entity109 expects to continue to work with @entity3 on some lead devices in the future , he said			0
@entity158 , @entity3 's head of mobile , said during a @entity3 conference call in august announcing the @entity6 acquisition that the new unit will be run as an independent business			1
as for preferential treatment regarding lead devices , @entity158 said @entity6 " will be part of that bidding process			0
" according to @entity149 , @entity109 was chosen for two of the three @entity142 phones because of its hardware expertise and access to components , and there is no bidding involved in the lead - device program			0
the @entity3 spokesman declined to comment on how exactly the process works .			0

@entity3 's mobile partners say the @entity10 maker wo n't be like @entity88
they say @entity3 has no plans to become a " vertical " phone maker
@entity3 has said it plans to run @entity6 as an independent business
