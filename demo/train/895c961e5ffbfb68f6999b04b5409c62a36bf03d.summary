-- when the @entity4 , a @entity7 ship carrying troops , began to sink off the coast of @entity9 in 1852 , the captain and military officers on board famously allowed women and children to board the lifeboats first			1
the captain and many of the troops stayed on the ship until the last , perishing in the ocean as the women and children made their way to safety			1
their chivalrous act of self - sacrifice is considered to have helped set the standard for noble conduct at sea			0
other displays of courage by captains and crew members who put their passengers first have punctuated the decades since , like capt. @entity29 who went down with the @entity30			2
but such bravery has been conspicuously absent from two major maritime disasters in recent times			0
capt. @entity34 of the @entity35 , the @entity37 ferry that sunk last week , has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board			1
dozens of them died and more than 200 were still missing monday			0
@entity34 's actions have prompted comparisons to those of capt. @entity47 who was in command of the cruise ship @entity51 , which crashed into a reef off the @entity54 coast in 2012 , killing 32 people			1
witnesses said @entity57 jumped into a lifeboat to flee the ship , even though hundreds of passengers were still on board			1
in his trial , the captain said he fell into a lifeboat when the ship listed sharply			1
@entity57 is now on trial on charges of manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board			1
the cases of the @entity35 and the @entity51 have raised questions about a captain 's obligations to passengers when a vessel runs into trouble			1
go down with ship ? by leaving the @entity35 soon after it began sinking , @entity34 reneged on some of his key duties , experts say			1
" the captain 's first obligation is for the safety of his crew and passengers , " capt. @entity84 , a maritime consultant , told @entity0			1
" he should stay on board that vessel until he knows everybody is safely evacuated			1
" and then the other reason he stays on board the vessel is for salvage rights			2
for the captain to leave the vessel in an early situation , it 's not the way it should be done			1
" an international maritime convention on the safety of life at sea makes a captain responsible for the vessel and all the people on board , but it does n't stipulate that the captain stay on the ship throughout the crisis			1
" you do n't necessarily want a captain dying with a ship			1
but he has a responsibility for the safety of everybody on board that ship , " said @entity115 , former @entity116 and president and founder of @entity119			1
" he 's got to be there and take care of that , " @entity115 told @entity0			2
" and this guy did n't do that			0
he was one of the first off			0
i mean , that 's kind of unforgivable , basically			2
" murky waters cloud horror facing divers criminal charges some countries , including @entity54 and @entity37 , make abandoning ship a maritime crime			1
and similarly to @entity57 in @entity54 , @entity34 is facing criminal charges over his role in the disaster , including abandoning his ship , negligence , causing bodily injury and not seeking rescue from other ships			1
@entity37 president @entity149 has likened the actions of @entity34 and some of the ferry 's crew members to murder			1
@entity57 and @entity34 are not alone in leaving a doomed ship before their passengers , though			0
as well as the role of honor for captains who went down with their vessels , there is hall of shame for those who jumped ship			2
in one example , the @entity54 steamer @entity164 was wrecked off the @entity168 coast in 1906 , killing more than 150 people			2
its captain was reported to have abandoned the ship at the first opportunity , but he died the following year of " a broken heart " according to a report in the @entity176			2
delayed evacuation @entity34 has drawn particular criticism for apparently ordering passengers to delay the evacuation of the @entity35 as it foundered			2
" the captain should have been passing honest and clear information on to everyone as to the situation , not telling them to just sit , " said @entity181 , a retired captain with the @entity183 @entity182			0
@entity34 has defended his actions			0
" it is a fairly fast current area , and the water temperature was cold , " he said , according to local media			0
" i thought that abandoning the ship without discretion would make you drift off a fairly far distance and cause a lot of trouble			2
at the same time , the rescue ship did not come , and there were no fishing boats or supporting ships around to help at that time			0
" anguish amplified by misinformation leadership vacuum @entity34 's early departure may have exacerbated the crisis on board the ship , said @entity181 , who teaches safety management at the @entity211			1
" when the leadership cuts and runs , it leaves a vacuum that is almost impossible to fill , " he told @entity0			2
" there should have been crewmembers going to the life raft stations			0
there should have been crew members mustering the passengers			0
so you know your head count			0
if there are missing people , there should have been other crew members searching the vessel to find those people			0
" although @entity183 law does n't specify abandoning ship as a crime , it 's a long - standing tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship , according to legal experts			1
" generally speaking , the captain is the last person to get off that vessel , " @entity84 said			0
' safer than any other vehicle ' he cautioned , though , that not all the details have emerged of @entity34 's actions during the crucial moments on the @entity35			1
" we do n't know if the coast guard demanded him to get off at that time , " he said			0
" they may have been alongside and told the captain he had to get off at that time			0
we 're not sure what happened there			0
" @entity34 appears to have been confident of his ability to ensure the safety of passengers in the past			0
in a promotional video from 2010 , he is pictured in the wheelhouse of a ship , looking out to sea through binoculars			0
he praises the security a ship provides to its passengers			0
" i believe it is safer than any other vehicle , " he says , " as long as they follow the instructions of our crew members			0

captains should stay on board until everybody is safe , experts say
the @entity35 and @entity51 captains buck a tradition of staying with the ship
in @entity54 , @entity37 and other countries , abandoning ship can be a crime
a captain 's early departure can leave a leadership vacuum , a safety expert says
