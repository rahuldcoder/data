@entity76 officers had reported plans for its missile test to the commission that monitors the 1953 armistice , @entity69 said during a trip to @entity85			1
he said no heightened alert has been issued for the nearly 30,000 @entity72 troops in @entity35 , which has a mutual - defense pact with the @entity72			1

" my leader , what will we do ? it 's too much ! it 's too much ! " one person sobbed			0
" leader , please come back			0
... you can not leave us			0
we will always wait for you , leader			0
" the network said @entity5 died of " overwork " while " dedicating his life to the people			1
" and the official news agency @entity153 said @entity5 suffered " great mental and physical strain " while on a train			1
@entity5 enjoyed a cult - like status in the nation , with millions schooled to accept him as a divine and benevolent father figure			0
@entity162 , one of two @entity72 journalists arrested after entering @entity2 in march 2009 and sentenced to 12 years hard labor before being released in august 2009 following intervention by former president @entity166 , told @entity0 's " @entity169 " monday that she was allowed to watch television while in custody			1
nearly every broadcast featured images of @entity5 as an " otherwordly figure , " she said , recalling her guards were " moved to tears watching their ' dear leader , ' and they talked about how much he was doing ( for the people			2
) " the guards said @entity5 's health was failing because he worked so hard for @entity76 , she said			1
her sister , @entity181 , filmed a documentary in @entity2 while posing as part of a medical team that performed eye surgeries			0
in a clip from the documentary , a young girl 's bandages are removed and she could see for the first time			0
" it 's all because of the great general , " her jubilant father exclaims			1
" we must bow to our great general for this			1
" there was no independent confirmation of the circumstances reported by the government , which routinely touted the military , technological and artistic genius of the " dear leader " -- even claiming he shot 11 holes in one in his first golf outing			0
but he had appeared frail in his last public appearances , and speculation about his health had persisted for some time			0
@entity153 acknowledged that @entity5 had been treated for " cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for a long period			1
" he suffered a heart attack on saturday and could n't be saved despite the use of " every possible first - aid measure , " according to the agency			1
in @entity90 , the @entity89 said @entity124 spoke with @entity40 on monday morning			0
the two leaders agreed to stay in " close touch as the situation develops , " it said			0

@entity117 president @entity224 visited the @entity76 embassy in @entity226 tuesday to offer condolences , according to the @entity117 state - run news agency @entity228			1
monday night , secretary of state @entity166 issued a statement acknowledging the " period of national mourning " in @entity2			1
" we are deeply concerned with the well being of the @entity76 people and our thoughts and prayers are with them during these difficult times , " the statement said			1
" it is our hope that the new leadership of the ( @entity76 ) will choose to guide their nation onto the path of peace by honoring @entity2 's commitments , improving relations with its neighbors and respecting the rights of its people , " @entity166 said			1
" the @entity72 stands ready to help the @entity76 people and urges the new leadership to work with the international community to usher in a new era of peace , prosperity and lasting security on the @entity50			1
" earlier , @entity258 , a former @entity72 diplomat who led @entity72 delegation in nuclear talks with @entity2 , said any @entity72 statement would require a certain finesse			2
" i 'd be very careful about issuing condolences on the death of someone who 's really been part and parcel of one of the most tyrannical regimes in the world , " @entity258 told @entity0			0
" on the other hand , i think something can be done that will show some sympathy to the @entity76			2
" this just in : up - to - the minute news on the death of @entity7 the deceased leader 's body will remain for a week at the @entity279 in @entity137 , where his father is also interred			2
memorial services will follow on december 28 and 29			0
@entity282 , a former @entity72 ambassador to the @entity283 who has visited @entity2 eight times , said his initial reaction to @entity5 's death was " extreme concern			2
" he said he is more concerned about stability in the region now than before @entity5 's death			0
" the peninsula is a tinderbox , " said @entity282 , who has brokered diplomatic deals in the @entity2			0
" the issue is , will there be stability in the @entity76 leadership ? will they continue their recent efforts of engaging @entity35 and the @entity72 over food aid , over nuclear talks ? " @entity282 said @entity35 was right to go on alert -- " but i think now 's the time to just lie low , watch things as they develop			1
" @entity304 : send us your reaction during @entity5 's tenure , the @entity2 was largely closed off to outside influences and fearful of threats from its neighbors			0
at the same time , it also sought international aid after extensive famines contributed to the deaths of at least 250,000 people , according to the @entity76 government			1
outside analysts suggested the toll could have been 10 times higher			0
both @entity2 and @entity35 have shown signs of concession in recent years			0
but relations between the two rival nations soured yet again when the @entity35 accused the @entity97 of launching an attack on the @entity35 island of @entity325 , killing two @entity35 marines and two civilians			2
and @entity35 says a @entity76 torpedo attack was to blame for the 2010 sinking of the @entity35 warship @entity331 , which left 46 @entity333 sailors dead			1
the @entity97 has denied the accusation			0
now the question is what path his untested son , believed to be either 27 or 28 , will take the country			2
he was educated in @entity340 as a boy , and named a four - star general in 2010			2
" we really do n't know substantively where he stands on anything , " said @entity343 , a senior fellow at the @entity72 - @entity344			1
@entity56 said the @entity2 has built up its military and pursued a nuclear bomb " while children are starving			0
" " this causes a lot of human disasters , " he said			0
" so what worries me is not this @entity17 's personality , but the priority of the @entity76 leadership			1
" after the @entity331 incident , then - @entity72 defense secretary @entity359 said he feared the younger @entity5 may have needed to " earn his stripes " with @entity137 's military establishment by launching further provocations			2
and @entity258 said while the " great successor " is " definitely not ready for prime time , " he is unlikely to take major steps before consolidating his power			1
" i think we 're kind of shifting , at least for the time being , to a sort of military junta , " he said , adding , " i would expect that they will try to show a maximum of stability as they go through what 's obviously going to be a very difficult and dicey time for them			0
" @entity0 's @entity40 , @entity380 , @entity381 and @entity382 contributed to this report .			0
