" the flirtation of young girls can often trigger violence			1
" that 's the message from police in @entity5 , @entity6 , as part of a campaign to raise awareness against rape			1
as if that was n't enough , the message was paired with a video showing a young woman being approached by a hooded man outside a nightclub			0
the young woman is then shown lying on the ground			0
several @entity6 advocacy groups are now voicing " dismay " with the regional police department 's efforts , saying the campaign blames women , rather than characterizing them as potential victims who should be protected			1
" ( the video ) scares and humiliates the victims and exonerates the perpetrators to go unpunished , " the groups said in a joint statement			2
" ... these kind of films evoke misogyny and contempt for women			0
" the video , titled " @entity35 , " was released almost a week ago by authorities in @entity5 in southern @entity6			1
it features young adult actors , including dressed - up women who are out clubbing , partying and flirting with young men			0
the hooded attacker approaches one of the women , later depicted lying on the ground , near the end of the video			2
in a statement posted alongside the video , police say , " experience has shown that , in order to prevent such acts ( of violence ) , how women communicate ... plays a huge role			2
the flirtation of young girls can often trigger violence			1
" the statement goes on to say that if a woman flirts with a man , then rejects him , " this may create anger			0
" police also urge women to " radiate confidence with ... behavior			0
" " self - confidence is important , " the statement adds , " so it is important to believe in ourselves to avoid becoming a victim			0
" the combination of the video of partying young women and the statement outraged a coalition of @entity6 women 's rights groups , which claims it " completely ignores that sexual violence " happens because of a decision by the attacker , not the victim			1
" the mission of the police is to protect and serve the public , rather than blaming the victims , or potential victims , or to pass on the responsibility on them , " the groups said .			2
