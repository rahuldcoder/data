-- this holiday season , many people received e-book readers as gifts -- but what about the books ? it has been surprisingly difficult to give someone an e-book as a gift			1
you could buy them a gift card for the e-book service of their choice , and maybe suggest which book to purchase , but you could n't actually purchase it for them			2
in november , @entity18 changed that			1
you can now buy a @entity22 book as a gift			2
recently i tested this by purchasing a holiday gift for a friend			0
she reported that obtaining my gift was easy -- she got an e-mail notification of the gift , clicked a link in the e-mail , clicked a link on the @entity18 site to accept the gift , and then was able to download the book to her @entity22			2
this process also works for people who use the free @entity22 smartphone or tablet apps , rather than the @entity22 device			0
however if someone you know uses one of the other popular brand - name e-readers , they 're probably out of luck for direct e-book gifting			0
so far , you can not give a @entity48 directly as a gift			1
nor can you give an @entity51 , or a @entity53 e-book			1
you can , of course , buy or obtain e-books in other formats -- there are many : plain text , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , and more			1
but you 'd need to check first whether your recipient would be able to use these book formats , and that would probably ruin the surprise			0
as a @entity22 user who has many friends who also use the @entity22 , i 'm glad that @entity18 finally began offering this option			0
obviously it can be done , and the experiences can be user - friendly for the buyer and recipient			0
but i 'm surprised @entity76 , @entity48 and @entity53 have n't followed @entity18 's lead on this			1
they 're just leaving money on the table -- and in the current tight economy , what retailer can afford to do that ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity86 .			0

@entity18 changed its *policy* to allow *customers* to give e-books as gifts
but you can not directly give a @entity48 , an *ibook* or a @entity53 e-book as a gift
e-book users can , of course , buy or obtain e-books in other formats
