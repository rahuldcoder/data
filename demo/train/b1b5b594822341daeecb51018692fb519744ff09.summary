tired of hokey in - flight movies or spotty @entity3 connections ? @entity4 is adding an option for watching tv during flights that lets passengers stream content directly to their laptop , @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity12 for free			1
the airline announced the new entertainment system in february and will roll it out on @entity16 flights starting in april			0
@entity4 will preload 150 movies and 200 tv shows onto an on - board system			1
passengers with compatible devices will be able to stream directly from a server on the plane , so there 's no need to pay for in - flight @entity27 service , and the airline wo n't have to worry about an entire airplane of people gobbling up bandwidth while binge - watching			1
@entity4 has chosen a combination of new and classic content , including popular tv shows " @entity35 " and @entity37 's " @entity36 " to start			1
eventually the aircraft will swap in fresh movies and episodes every month so frequent fliers do n't run out of things to watch			0
the program does have some limitations			0
the most notable is that it only works with @entity47 smartphones and tablets running @entity49 and above for the time being			0
to watch shows on an @entity54 device , passengers must download the official @entity4 app. @entity56 users are out in the cold unless they have a laptop handy , but @entity4 is working on adding support			2
" we expect to offer the same service for users of @entity56 mobile devices later this year , " said a @entity4 spokesperson			1
passengers can watch the movies and shows only while in the air , but @entity4 plans on making it work from " gate - to-gate " to reflect recent changes in mobile device policies			1
late last year , the @entity71 changed its policy to allow passengers to use mobile devices before and during takeoff and landing , at the discretion of the airlines			2
on computers , the streaming works with @entity81 computers running @entity82 and @entity83			2
it requires the most recent versions of the @entity86 , @entity87 or internet explorer browsers			0
@entity90 laptops must have @entity91 or higher and use @entity92 , @entity86 or @entity87			0
the browsers must run flash 10.3 or higher			0
for security reasons , some of the content can only be viewed with a specific browser plug - in , which can be downloaded in - flight			2
the first planes to offer the feature will be the @entity101 and @entity102 , the @entity104 and some @entity103			0
to decide if you need to download all three seasons of " @entity107 " before getting on a cross-country @entity4 flight , check to see whether the new in - flight mobile streaming service is offered by looking at the list of amenities for your flight .			1

@entity4 is adding free in - flight movie and tv streaming starting in april
