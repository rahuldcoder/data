-- we each spend an average of three years of our lives sitting on them , @entity1 of @entity2 died while on his in 1760 and 2.5 billion people still do not have access to one			1
the humble lavatory is the unlikely subject of global celebration on monday , as one of the world 's most essential inventions but one that too many people still struggle without			2
although many of us tend to take ours for granted , campaigners hope that @entity20 will draw attention to what they 're calling the " global sanitation crisis , " with over a third of people worldwide living without a clean and private place to go			1
this means that one in three people still have to defecate in the open , using fields or bushes , rivers , railway lines or roadsides , or simply a plastic bag			1
others use unsanitary latrines or disease - ridden and foul - smelling buckets			0
the majority of those without access to a toilet live in @entity43 or @entity44 , with over half of people in @entity44 not having proper sanitation , according to the @entity49 - based charity , @entity48			1
@entity50 lives in a slum in the city of @entity53 in the @entity55 province of @entity56			1
she told @entity48 how people in her community have to defecate on a nearby hilltop			1
" there are no trees and privacy at the moment and so we have to wait until night to go there			0
it 's difficult for old people to go and it 's hard to go at night			2
it 's also hard for grown - up girls because of the risk of sexual attack , " @entity50 said			2
this @entity20 , international aid agencies are highlighting the particular risks to women of poor access to toilets			1
@entity48 says women are most vulnerable because they 're not only exposed to disease , but also have additional shame , harassment and risk of attack when they go out in the open			1
@entity84 in @entity85 described to @entity48 how she has to cross a very dangerous bridge every time she goes to the bush to defecate			2
" i think it takes 15 minutes to get to the bridge , " @entity89 says			0
" i come here once a day , between 4 and 5 pm			0
at night it is very dangerous			0
a woman and a boy were killed with knives			0
one woman i know of has been raped			0
" but it 's not just the shame and inconvenience of having no private place to go to the toilet , but a huge public health issue			2
when you consider that one gram of faeces can contain 10 million viruses , one million bacteria , one thousand parasite cysts and one hundred worm eggs ( according to @entity110 ) you can see why open defecation is so harmful to a community 's health			0
without a sewerage system to remove human waste and make it safe , cholera , typhoid and other infectious diseases spread quickly			0
the @entity120 says more than 2.7 million people die each year due to lack of sanitation			1
with diarrhoeal diseases killing more young children in developing countries than hiv / aids , malaria and measles put together , it 's the second biggest cause of death in under fives , according to the @entity132			0
tackling it , says the @entity135 's @entity134 , is extremely cost effective			1
it estimates that poor sanitation costs @entity139 countries around $ 5.5 billion a year and $ 53.8 billion in @entity56 is lost through associated economic impacts			1
the program 's study of 18 @entity139 countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discrete location to use the toilet accounted for almost $ 500 million in economic losses			2
that 's before you examine the cost of healthcare , premature deaths and lost workdays due to illness			0
in fact , according to the @entity20 organization , every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of five dollars			1
its message is that the solution to the global sanitation crisis lies not in any miraculous technological breakthroughs but in stronger political leadership and a commitment to invest in sanitation infrastructure and education			0
@entity171 for one seemed to recognized the value of the toilet to humanity when he said " sanitation is more important than independence			0
" campaigners for @entity20 will be hoping that these words resonate with today 's leaders .			2

@entity20 highlights *plight* of 2.5 billion people who do *n't* have access to basic sanitation
charity *focusing* on dangers for women who must defecate on open ground
the situation causes shame for millions and also leaves them open to attack
lack of basic sanitation costs @entity43 $ *5.3* billion and @entity56 $ 53.8 billion according to @entity135
