-- should the press be more heavily regulated ? share your thoughts here			0
could the phone - hacking scandal prove to be a blessing in disguise for @entity7 ? a year ago that would have seemed a ridiculous notion			1
@entity12 's @entity11 newspaper arm almost collapsed last summer under the weight of a story that dominated @entity11 's news agenda for months , prompting a sting of resignations and a high - profile public inquiry			1
it was a conflagration that briefly threatened to engulf the entire company , forcing a fire - fighting @entity7 to appear before @entity11 lawmakers in @entity22 and declare : " this is the most humble day of my life			2
" yet since @entity12 responded to the crisis by confirming in the spring it would spin off its publishing assets into a separate company , the media conglomerate 's stock has soared			1
@entity12 's share price has risen by 20 % since july 2011 , adding more than $ 5 billion to the value of the company			2
insiders say executives are surprised by the positive way @entity35 received its decision to hive off its print titles			0
the phone - hacking scandal , which resulted in the closure of @entity11 sunday tabloid @entity40 , forced @entity7 to do what frustrated investors had been urging him to do for years : jettison the company 's troublesome newspaper titles , which include the @entity45 and the @entity46 the surge in the company 's share price reflects optimism about the future of the company once it is freed from the deadweight of print in 2013			1
the @entity55 , which @entity12 also owns , is profitable because it has figured out a way to make money online by charging for content , but other titles are struggling			2
shareholders in the @entity61 have long viewed @entity7 's attachment to his @entity22 - based papers , in particular , as an expensive indulgence			1
they approve of @entity12 's renewed focus on broadcasting , a part of the media industry that is growing			2
@entity7 has spent money taking full control of @entity72 's largest pay - tv operator and acquiring the local network that screens @entity75 games			1
@entity77 veteran @entity76 , a reassuring presence , is firmly established as @entity7 's second in command			2
the constant chatter about which member of the @entity7 family will be shoe - horned into the ceo 's chair to succeed the old man has fallen quiet , at least for now			2
a @entity88 set up to deal with the fallout from the phone - hacking affair has been cooperating with @entity91 , uncovering evidence of illegal payments to public officials , but its work is nearly complete			1
it feels as if the company might finally be putting phone - hacking behind it			1
@entity7 is enthused about the creation of " pubco " and bullish about its prospects , convinced there is still plenty of money to be made in print			2
a senior company source describes him as " obsessed " with the business			0
he is planning a spending spree once the company is established , and is busy finalizing a string of executive appointments			0
the company is expected to be run by @entity113 , an @entity72 who once edited the @entity45 of @entity22 and now runs the @entity55 , and there is talk of bringing forward the stock market flotation			0
the business has recovered its momentum and @entity7 has rediscovered his mojo			0
his frequent and combative tweets , covering subjects from @entity11 press regulation to @entity124 's uncertain future , is testament to that			0
yet those who regard the 81 - year - old 's enthusiasm for newspapers as an enduring weakness may ultimately be proved right			0
the new publishing business will be given a large amount of cash by @entity12 , a generous dowry to ensure a good start in life , cash that shareholders may feel would be more effectively deployed elsewhere			2
it is believed @entity7 tried to persuade his oldest son @entity140 to return to the family fold as chief executive of the publishing business , a reminder that succession is the thorniest issue of all at @entity12 his second son @entity147 , who was badly damaged by the phone - hacking affair , is quietly running @entity149 in the @entity61 and reporting directly to @entity76 , but no one doubts his father wants him to run the company when he finally steps aside			1
that could prompt a showdown with investors that @entity7 may no longer be strong enough to win			0
phone - hacking damaged @entity7 and the specter of an @entity160 investigation into alleged payments to foreign officials , a criminal offense under the @entity157 , still casts a long shadow over @entity12 the company has not commented on any potential investigation			1
the most likely outcome is a settlement with the @entity61 authorities that will cost the company millions of dollars , but it would be wrong to assume the hacking saga will end there			0
in april last year , @entity173 , who was then in charge of @entity12 's @entity176 and @entity177 businesses , told a conference the company had successfully put phone - hacking " in a box			1
" three weeks later , three of @entity7 's key executives had resigned and the @entity40 had been dramatically shuttered			1
@entity7 has not been held personally responsible for phone - hacking but further criticism could undermine his authority			1
the @entity186 is critical of the @entity40 and says there was a failure of governance at @entity190			0
but it also says there is no evidence @entity7 knew phone - hacking was rife , or that he orchestrated a cover - up			1
@entity196 is less equivocal about @entity173 , saying there are aspects of his evidence " that cause me some concern "			0
it stops short of criticizing the younger @entity7 further , citing ongoing police investigations into criminality at @entity190 , but the verdict is not a favorable one for @entity147 , and it may harm his chance of succeeding his father			0
that is unwelcome news for @entity7 , who desperately wants to keep his business empire in the family			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			0

@entity7 *claimed* to have been " humbled " by the phone - hacking scandal
*revelations* about *journalistic* practises at the @entity40 led to the tabloid 's closure
since the scandal , @entity12 has decided to split its publishing assets into separate firm
