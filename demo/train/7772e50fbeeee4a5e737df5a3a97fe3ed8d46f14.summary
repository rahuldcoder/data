-- we 've all wondered what it 's like to die			2
now there 's a game that claims it can fulfill our curiosity , without actually killing us			2
" @entity14 -- @entity15 of @entity16 , " is a morbid " escape room " game that uses dramatic special effects to bring players close to what its creators imagine is an experience of death			1
when it opens in @entity20 in september 2014 , it will invite participants to compete in a series of challenges to avoid " dying			0
" losers get cremated -- or are at least made to lie on a conveyor belt that transports them through a fake funeral home incinerator to simulate death rites			1
the faux cremator will use hot air and light projections to create what the organizers call " an authentic experience of burning			2
" after " cremation , " participants are transferred to a soft , round , womb - like capsule , signifying their " rebirth			2
" and the winner ? " he 'll also have to die of course , " says the game 's fatalistic co-founder @entity41			2
as in life , he explains , " everyone will die eventually , no matter what they 've survived			2
" life and death @entity41 and his partner @entity51 went to great lengths researching their game , investigating the cremation process that typically awaits 50 % of @entity56 people after death			1
the pair visited a real crematorium and asked to be sent through the furnace with the flames turned off			0
" @entity41 went in the crematory first and it was stressful for me to observe from the outside , " says @entity51			0
" the controller of the crematory was also very nervous ; he usually just focuses on sending bodies in , but not on bringing them back out			0
" when it came to @entity51 's turn , he found it unbearable			0
" it was getting really hot			0
i could n't breathe and i thought my life was over , " he said			1
the pair say realism is essential to provoke participants into thinking about life and death			1
they 'll operate the game while also running @entity80 , an organization that specializes in providing hospice support to dying patients in an oncology hospital			2
soul searching @entity51 says his interest in death emerged during a period of soul searching after a lucrative but spiritually unrewarding career as a trader			0
" @entity56 made me rich , but it did n't teach me how to live a rich life			1
i was lost , " he says			0
he went on to study psychology and volunteered to help in the aftermath of a 2008 earthquake in @entity56 's western @entity96 province , launching @entity97 shortly after			1
" it opened a new door for me -- i went there to help but i was also saved			0
" @entity41 , meanwhile , had undertaken his own search for a meaning to life by organizing seminars with experts on the subject			1
" i invited ' life masters ' from different religions and other fields to come and talk about what life is , " he says			0
" i did that for two years before realizing that , instead of sitting here and listening passively , i could also do something			0
" that was when the two hooked up to create the " @entity15 of @entity16			0
" morbid curiosity the pair were initially unsure of the appetite for their morbid concept , even though similar ventures have already opened in @entity122 and @entity123			0
voluntary work in a hospice showed them that few people wanted to confront the idea of death , even when it was at hand			1
" the saddest part of the job was n't seeing the patients passing away but how the families refused to face death -- the final days with their loved ones consisted of kind but shallow lies , " says @entity41			1
" we lack understanding of death and the fear can become so overwhelming			0
" to sound out the idea , @entity51 and @entity41 first started a fundraising campaign on jue.so , the @entity56 version of @entity146			1
" we received more than rmb 410,000 ( $ 67,000 ) in three months , surpassing our target , " says @entity51			0
" it turns out many people in @entity56 are curious about death			1
" @entity41 says they hope the experience will promote " life education " -- prompting people to ask questions about what they are doing with their lives and guiding them to face death in a personal way			1
" there are n't any model answers in life and death education , unlike those courses that teach you to be rich and successful , " says @entity51			1
" it is more important for people to experience it personally			2
" " i was in a car crash once and the only thought in my mind then was ' why did n't i buy insurance ? ' " says @entity51			0
" it was n't what i had imagined for the final moments of my life			1
that romantic idea of having a flashback of one 's entire life in the last moments before death -- that did not happen			1
" @entity14 -- @entity15 of @entity16 will be completed at the end of august and is scheduled to open in september			1
sessions will be conducted in @entity56			2
