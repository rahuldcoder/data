@entity0 -- six months to the day before @entity3 , builders have handed the @entity4 over to the @entity6 organizers			1
the first of 16,000 beds have been delivered as organizers start to fit out the rooms			2
" we are starting the huge process to install essential facilities and services ready to welcome competitors from around the world in six months ' time , " @entity11 , chairman of the @entity12 said in a press release issued early friday			1
the beds will soon be joined by 11,000 sofas and even 5,000 toilet brushes , say organizers			2
the @entity24 run from july 27 through august 12			1
@entity4 , a huge housing complex of some 2,800 apartments within walking distance of the stadium in @entity0 , has already been sold as part of the post-games legacy plans			1
nearly 1,400 of the apartments were sold in 2009 for $ 400 million and will be rented by local governments for subsidized housing			0
the remainder was sold to a consortium , including the @entity37 government , as part of a $ 800 million deal to own and manage the entire village			0
local campaigners have pushed for more of the apartments to be social housing as part of the organizer 's pledge to regenerate the area post-games			0
the original plan was for the developer @entity50 to raise the funding privately to build the village , but the work started in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis			0
the government decided instead to the foot the reported $ 1.6 billion bill and is unlikely to recoup the entire cost of the housing			0
the complex will be known as @entity4 once it is turned over to renters and homeowners .			2

@entity4 in @entity0 ready for next *phase*
