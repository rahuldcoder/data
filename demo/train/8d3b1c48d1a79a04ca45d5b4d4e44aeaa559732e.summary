an internal @entity1 audit released monday said tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care , while even more who signed up in the @entity6 system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested			1
the review provides a more complete picture of widespread problems at the agency 's health care facilities -- as reported by @entity14 over the past seven months -- than preliminary findings last month that led to the resignation of @entity1 secretary @entity17			1
" this data shows the extent of the systemic problems we face , problems that demand immediate actions , " said acting va secretary @entity18 , who took over after @entity17 stepped aside			1
deadly waits reports of the sometimes fatal waits , with the @entity6 acknowledging 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care , sparked public anger over problems at the @entity6 that have existed for years			1
despite efforts to address some issues in recent years , including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans , the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care			0
reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in @entity46 and @entity47 , and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment			0
14 - day goal " not attainable " the audit findings , covering 731 va facilities nationwide and based on interviews with more than 3,700 staff members , said a 14 - day goal for providing care to newly enrolled veterans proved " simply not attainable " due to growing demand and a lack of capacity			1
" imposing this expectation on the field before ascertaining the resources required and its ensuing broad promulgation represent an organizational leadership failure , " it said of the deadline imposed under @entity17			2
according to @entity14 's previous reporting , managers in @entity72 and elsewhere used secret waiting lists to cover up the amount of time it took for veterans to get appointments			2
" in some cases , pressures were placed on schedulers to utilize unofficial lists or engage in inappropriate practices in order to make waiting times appear more favorable , " said a fact sheet released with the audit			0
at the same time , the audit said that questions it posed " were not worded to ascertain the reason that policy may have been violated , " adding that its findings " can not be extended to identify deliberate deception , fraud , or malfeasance			0
" keyword search the audit the figures in the audit -- 57,436 newly enrolled veterans facing a minimum 90 - day wait for medical care ; 63,869 veterans who enrolled over the past decade requesting an appointment that never happened -- show the scope of the problem			2
at the same time , both figures represent about 1 % of the total 6 million or so appointments in the @entity6 system now , and do n't reflect possible changing circumstances , such as enrolled veterans who seek care at a different facility than the one where they first signed up			2
@entity18 's statement said the @entity6 has contacted 50,000 veterans " to get them off of wait lists and into clinics " so far , and planned to contact another 40,000			2
steps taken other steps he announced included : removing the 14 - day scheduling goal			2
suspending all performance awards for @entity126 senior executives for fiscal year 2014 , which runs through september			0
a hiring freeze at @entity130 headquarters in @entity131 and the 21 @entity126 regional offices , " except for critical positions to be approved by the secretary on a case - by - case basis			2
" a new patient satisfaction measurement program			0
ordering an independent , outside audit of @entity126 scheduling practices across the system			0
this would differ from a review being conducted by the @entity6 inspector general 's office			1
applying reforms announced for the @entity6 facility to others considered the " most challenged			0
" deploying mobile medical units to provide services to veterans awaiting care			0
@entity14 first reported the extensive problems at the @entity6 facility , including an interview with a whistleblower who said dozens of veterans died while waiting for care there			1
fatal waits in @entity72 changes needed @entity160 spokesman @entity159 said the new audit showed " some personnel changes need to be made and some have already , " in reference to @entity17 's departure and some top managers in @entity72 placed on administrative leave			1
" it 's also clear there need to be some management changes in terms of ... the procedures that the @entity6 has in place to fulfill their responsibilities , " @entity159 said			0
some in @entity176 on both sides of the aisle have called for a criminal investigation , and 21 senators sent a letter monday to attorney general @entity182 asking for the @entity183 to get involved			1
" this challenge requires resources that only the @entity189 can provide in developing and assessing evidence , pursuing leads , and initiating active prosecutions aggressively if warranted , " said the letter from 10 republicans and 11 @entity186			0
bring in the feds the signers included @entity195 in @entity196 , @entity197 of @entity198 and @entity199 of @entity200 -- democrats from traditionally conservative states who face tough re-election battles in november			0
@entity205 , the acting @entity6 inspector general conducting his own review of the system , has said he regularly consults with the @entity189 as part of his inquiry			1
a justice spokesperson said monday that " the department continues to consult with the veterans affairs office of inspector general regarding their ongoing review			1
" declining further comment on an " ongoing matter , " the spokesperson said the department " often consults with inspectors general on legal matters and acts on any referrals should they find sufficient predicate for a criminal investigation			0
" @entity205 said on monday that his office is now looking at 69 va facilities .			1
