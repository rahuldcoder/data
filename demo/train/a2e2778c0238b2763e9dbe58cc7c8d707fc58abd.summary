-- @entity1 was running out for @entity2			2
if the @entity5 frontman was going to make a move it would be soon			0
just days before @entity2 had lost his final bid in @entity9 's highest court to stop his extradition to @entity11 for questioning about sexual assault allegations			2
the court had set a july 7 deadline			0
though the sexual misconduct case has nothing to do with @entity5 , some of his supporters believe that if @entity2 is sent to @entity11 , he would be vulnerable to extradition to the @entity21			1
@entity5 published a trove of @entity24 cables and secret documents , some of them classified , about the @entity29 and @entity30 wars			0
@entity2 is not currently facing criminal charges in the @entity21 so where in the world should @entity2 turn for refuge ? he picked @entity35 , which has just approved his request for asylum			1
" it 's a very smart move to go there			1
@entity35 's president @entity46 and @entity2 have mutual interests -- they both support the idea that the @entity21 is an imperial power that has to be checked , " said @entity40 , a @entity41 international lawyer who 's worked high profile cases involving @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
he said the information contained in the cables @entity5 released has helped in some of his cases			0
@entity46 , a left - leaning economist , has railed against the @entity21 in concert with allies in the region and elsewhere -- @entity58 's @entity57 , @entity60 's @entity59 , @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity64 's @entity63			1
as far as angering the @entity9 government , @entity46 has shown he does n't mind doing that			2
in february , @entity46 called for sanctions against @entity9 for its long - running dispute with @entity70 over who owns the @entity72			2
" from a @entity74 perspective , what a glorious thing to get @entity2 , " @entity40 said			2
" you do n't have to be even anti-american to want to do that			0
when i 'm in @entity81 , they still call the ( @entity21 ) ' the empire			2
' there really is an almost universal hostility toward @entity21 foreign policy			2
@entity2 would be welcomed in many countries just for that fact			2
" @entity88 , an @entity35 political analyst who lives in @entity89 , said that with presidential elections in @entity35 scheduled for next february giving @entity2 asylum in the country could be " useful to @entity46 to give himself a leftist image			1
" " a lot of his base is leftist , " said @entity88			0
" he has to feed that base			0
" @entity46 and @entity2 @entity35 president @entity46 recently appeared on @entity2 's new television show , " @entity102 , " which began broadcasting in april on @entity99 , @entity44 's state - funded @entity101 language channel			1
@entity2 introduced his guest by calling @entity46 " a transformative leader , " and pointed out that @entity46 expelled the @entity21 ambassador after reports that a @entity5 @entity24 cable showed that the @entity21 ambassador was concerned about an allegedly corrupt high ranking police official			1
the cable , published by @entity112 newspaper @entity111 , said @entity46 was aware of corruption by the police high command			0
the website of @entity2 's tv show described it differently , saying the cable showed the @entity21 " embassy exercising influence over members of the @entity35 police force			1
" " your @entity5 has made us stronger ! " @entity46 told @entity2			1
@entity2 and @entity46 seemed to have a rapport , praising each other and at times laughing like old friends who shared inside jokes			1
@entity2 began the interview by asking @entity46 what he thinks of the @entity21			1
@entity46 answered by accusing the @entity21 of meddling in @entity35 's police force , yet then said the countries have a relationship based on " affection and friendship			1
" @entity46 went on to say he lived in the @entity21 for four years and got two academic degrees in the @entity21 " i love and admire the @entity21 people a great deal , " he said			1
" the last thing i 'd be is anti-american , but i will always call a spade a spade			0
" later in the interview , @entity46 laughs about his decision not to renew the @entity147 's lease of @entity148 in @entity149 , which ended @entity21 occupancy of the base in 2009			1
@entity46 sarcastically suggested that he should be able to keep a base in @entity153			0
" i 'm enjoying your jokes a great deal , " @entity2 told the @entity35 president			1
a press freedom fighter in @entity35 ? " that interview was just @entity2 asking @entity46 a bunch of softball questions , " said @entity159 of the @entity160 of human rights group @entity161			1
@entity159 and other experts point out that @entity46 loves disclosures when it suits him , but he has one of the worst reputations in @entity43 for cracking down on journalists			0
@entity46 has filed defamation complaints against journalists who criticized him , forced independent radio and television stations to air lengthy rebuttals of critical reports , pre-empted programming and temporarily shut some stations down , according to the @entity179			2
in a june 9 radio address , @entity46 asked government ministers to stop granting interviews to private media because those outlets are " corrupt			0
" would n't that bother @entity2 , a self - professed pillar of the free press ? well , experts say , @entity2 's show is broadcast by a network financed by the @entity191 and @entity44 is n't known for its press freedoms			1
standing up for @entity193 may seem less important to @entity2 than saving himself right now , said @entity194			0
" if he winds up getting extradited to the @entity21 many people believe he 'd never see the light of day again , " the attorney said			0
" @entity2 is in a very dangerous place , " @entity40 said			0
but he said he feels the information disclosed by the @entity5 releases has " been incredible			0
" a legal and diplomatic ' mess ' if @entity2 thought he was in trouble by staying in @entity9 , he could be in even more trouble if he tries to leave , said international human rights attorney @entity206			1
@entity206 is best known for helping to free @entity208 nobel peace laureate @entity207			0
" the big challenge would be getting @entity2 from the @entity210 to @entity35			1
it would be very difficult , " @entity206 said			0
" he could end up spending years living in the embassy as the @entity213 are n't likely to look too kindly on this stunt and the @entity35 might provide him protection in their mission			0
" but it would be much more difficult to get him out and to a private plane to transit to @entity35			0
" @entity2 is subject to arrest by @entity9 authorities for violating a bail requirement that he spend every night at the home outside @entity225 , police said in june			0
in a written statement , @entity220 said that they were notified @entity2 may have breached one of the conditions of his bail			0
if @entity2 shows up in @entity35 there could be criminal repercussions and diplomatic repercussions			1
" if a fugitive were to show up in @entity35 after escaping from @entity9 territory and be protected by the @entity35 authorities , it would be a diplomatic mess , " @entity159 said			1
" if @entity2 arrives in @entity35 , the first thing the @entity213 would probably do is remove their ambassador from @entity35 , " he said			2
it would also mean @entity21 officials , experts said , would inevitably have to start talking about @entity2 again , two years after the @entity243 first became a thorn in their side by releasing his first batch of secret @entity21 documents			2
@entity0 's @entity248 contributed to this report .			0
