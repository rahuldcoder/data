@entity0 says he 's not running for president again			1
no chance of changing it			0
well , except for his " @entity7 " scenario			1
@entity0 's reference to the @entity10 movie came up as he explained again on the @entity12 radio show tuesday night all the reasons he 's sitting out the 2016 presidential race			1
@entity0 said , " someone else stands a better chance of winning than i do			1
had that not been the case , had i believed i would actually be best positioned to beat @entity18 , then i would be running			0
" despite the calls from some @entity20 for the 2012 nominee to take another shot in 2016 , @entity0 again said , " i actually believe that someone new , someone not defined yet , someone who perhaps is from the next generation , will be able to catch fire potentially , build a movement and be able to beat @entity18			1
" if i thought that were n't the case , " he added , " then i would be running			0
" but @entity12 pressed him , saying that had to be subject to change if circumstances became different			2
" i 'm not going there , " @entity0 responded , laughing			2
" this is something we gave a lot of thought to when i decided early on we 're not going to run this time			2
i had the chance of running			0
" then he added , " circumstances can change , but i 'm just not going to let my head go there			0
i remember that great line from " @entity7 ... " as @entity12 said the line ( " so you 're telling me there 's a chance " ) , @entity0 said , " there you go			1
so you 're telling me i have a chance			0
yes , one out of a million			0
" @entity0 then painted a scenario about as likely as @entity10 's @entity7 winning over @entity49			1
" well , let 's say all the guys that were running all came together and said , ' hey , we decided we ca n't do it , ' " he said			2
" you must do it			0
that 's the one of a million we 're thinking about			0
" which allows the political media to say , so you 're telling us there 's a chance ... opinion : will @entity0 run for president in 2016 ? @entity0 : @entity64 wo n't be able to distance herself from @entity66			1

@entity0 tells radio talk show host @entity12 he has no plans to run for president again
he hopes someone from the @entity20 's " next generation " will " catch fire " and win in 2016
