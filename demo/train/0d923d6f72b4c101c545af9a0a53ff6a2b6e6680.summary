last december 5 , just after 7 p.m. @entity2 time , i got a text message from one member of @entity6 's family			1
" and so that 's how i knew a great man was taking his final breaths			2
" it 's done , " said the next message from those who were with him at the end			2
it was 9 p.m. and @entity6 was gone			2
by that stage , we were all in the @entity19 bureau and ready to go live , to tell the world @entity6 was gone			1
however , i had made a promise to my sources that i would not go to air with any information they gave me about his condition until there were an official announcement by president @entity30			0
the televised address to the nation came just before midnight			0
it was a long wait , but i was so grateful to his family for trusting me with the information -- those three hours of preparation allowed me the time and space to clear my head			0
i am a @entity2 , a white @entity2 whose country was changed for the better by his visionary leadership			2
i had my own personal thanks to give for @entity6 's life			1
then i had the responsibility of delivering this news to @entity19 's global audience			1
that task continued for the next 11 days until he was buried in the rural hills around his boyhood home in @entity53 , @entity54			0
the immediate days after @entity6 's passing created a wonderful celebratory mood in the country -- strange as it might have seemed to others			1
for @entity2 , it was the most natural reaction			2
sadness and mourning had been done already in the months before , when he was critically ill. now , @entity2 gave thanks , paused in gratefulness and came together in ways that reflected the debt they owed to this one man			1
white , black , old , young gathered outside his house in @entity72 , laying flowers and saying a personal prayer of thanks			0
it was astounding to watch			0
the manicured pavement lawns of suburban @entity76 became like an altar of reflection for a time of hope and reconciliation that seemed like an age away			0
it was called " @entity89 " -- and now that he was gone it felt like the ' magic ' that had sustained a battered , racist nation would go with him			1
it was always an ephemeral , false even , suggestion that @entity6 saved @entity2			1
@entity2 did it together , he just led them on the right path			2
still , older @entity2 brought their children , some just babies wrapped in blankets , to his home in the days after he died			1
often , they dressed the kids up in their best clothes , like they were going to church , and solemnly walked to the piles of flowers on the sidewalk or loitered by the exterior walls			0
it was as if a whole generation of @entity2 wanted their kids to feel and breathe in that last little bit of " @entity89			1
' there was an important sense of occasion , a primal need to ' be there			0
' at times , i watched families appear quietly outside @entity6 's home and silently soak up the atmosphere			1
other times , i felt like i was watching worshipers presenting gifts to a deity , pushing forward toddlers and young kids to the front of crowds just so their children could be closer to the place where he died			0
in years to come , a new generation of children will be able to say , " i was there			0
" @entity6 's funeral was a measure of the man			1
i watched from inside the funeral tent and thought how apt it was that his goodbye was both about pageantry and plain - speaking			0
i stood by his casket as it made the final journey and softly said goodbye and thank you as that great man was laid to rest on a simple grass mat , as he had wished .			0
