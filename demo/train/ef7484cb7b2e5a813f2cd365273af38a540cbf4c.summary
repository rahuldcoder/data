-- emergency rooms around the @entity2 are preparing for the people who may have @entity4 and for the people who just think they have @entity4			1
" i have seen several people who had acute illnesses worried that they may have @entity4 , " said dr. @entity6			1
he works as an emergency room doctor in @entity10			1
he 's also president of the @entity11			2
@entity6 says these patients are unlikely candidates , not having been to @entity13 , nor having had any contact with a symptomatic @entity4 patient			1
" but it has gotten a tremendous amount of media coverage and some people are especially concerned about it , even if it is highly unlikely , " @entity6 said			0
emergency rooms typically see a small uptick in traffic after a disease has been in the news a lot			1
a 2010 study that looked at emergency room traffic when swine flu was in the news saw a 7 % increase in emergency room visits			0
parents must also have been worried about their children catching it as pediatric visits increased 19.7 %			0
a recent @entity39 study showed 21 % of respondents are somewhat worried about @entity4 and their personal health			1
dr. @entity43 , the chief medical officer for disaster and emergency preparedness at @entity46 in @entity47 , said officials have not seen a significant patient increase with the @entity4 scare			1
they do , however , get cases from time to time where people think they may have it			1
the hospital is careful , he said to rule it out			0
" our health department and the media does a really reasonable job of educating the community about how people get it , " @entity43 said			0
" i think people are listening and we have not seen this rush of people			0
" " if someone has had contact with someone who has @entity4 symptoms or they have been in one of these countries , we want them to come in if they feel sick , and we are ready for it			1
we will pay close attention " @entity43 said			0
the number of deaths attributed to the current @entity4 outbreak has topped 4,000 , the @entity76 reported friday			2
the latest count brings the total number of confirmed , probable , or suspected cases to 8,399 and the total deaths to 4,033			0
the numbers were reported from @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and the @entity2			1
complete coverage on @entity4 but along with news of the rising death toll , some suspected @entity4 cases around the world -- as fears spread across four continents -- have turned out to be false			1
concerns about protective measures , especially for those caring for the infected , remain high			0
a total of 416 health care workers are among those believed to have contracted @entity4			2
of those , 233 of have died , the @entity76 says			0
' we just do n't really know ' an @entity2 aid worker who contracted @entity4 in @entity86 and overcame the virus was said to have become infected while treating @entity4 patients there , but she told @entity0 on friday that there is no way to be sure			1
@entity111 was working with @entity112 in @entity86 , caring for @entity4 patients , when she became ill and was eventually transferred to an @entity114 hospital , where she recovered			2
the belief has been that she contracted @entity4 while working in a clinic with infected patients , but the survivor said that is n't necessarily the point of infection			2
" well , it 's very possible that i contracted @entity4 outside of the ( medical ) unit , not within , " @entity111 said			1
" of course , i came in contact with people outside of our hospital , and i remember knowing and being with a gentleman one time that later died of @entity4			1
and it 's possible that there was , you know , some contact there			0
we just do n't really know			0
" @entity111 was released from @entity135 on august 19 , once doctors determined she posed " no public health threat			2
" her recovery has been gradual , @entity111 said , but she is gaining strength each day			0
how the ebola virus spreads the lack of clarity about where she became infected is significant as questions are raised worldwide about safety precautions at hospitals and communities as the outbreak stokes fears			0
the sole person to be diagnosed with the virus on @entity2 soil , @entity151 , died this week , as new details of his hospitalization were revealed			1
he had traveled from @entity86 last month			0
@entity151 first went to the hospital on september 25 , but the hospital said he only had a " low grade fever and abdominal pain , " and was released with some antibiotics and a pain reliever			2
on friday , @entity151 's nephew @entity162 told @entity0 that @entity151 in fact had a 103 - degree fever when he left the hospital , according to the discharge papers			1
talking to @entity0 's @entity167 on friday night , @entity162 alleged that the fact @entity151 was black , poor and did n't have insurance affected his care			1
" had that been another or another color , he probably would be living today , he would have survived it , " @entity171 said			0
" and that 's what 's hurting me the most : ... they treated him the way they did because of the color of his skin ... you stand a chance if you 're white , but you do n't if you 're back			0
" while it has n't responded to these latest allegations , @entity187 ' @entity186 did issue a statement thursday explaining and defending its treatment of @entity151			1
why was n't he immediately given an experimental drug ? because one was n't available , the hospital explained			0
why did n't he get a blood transfusion , like other @entity4 patients in the @entity2 ? because " his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors			1
" and as to whether @entity151 got inferior treatment because of his nationality or wealth , @entity186 said more than 50 people cared for him and a 24 - bed intensive care unit was devoted to his care			1
" our care team provided mr. @entity151 with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient , regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care , " the hospital said			2
" ... we have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area			0
" suspected case comes back negative on thursday , a test to see whether a @entity187 sheriff 's deputy had @entity4 came back negative , state health officials said			1
word of the test result was welcome news a day after the death of @entity151			2
the deputy had reported being inside the @entity187 apartment where @entity151 had been staying and having " some contact " with @entity151 's family members , @entity223 fire chief @entity222 told reporters			1
@entity4 spreads through infected bodily fluids			2
the deputy , @entity230 , on friday spoke about awaking after having been on duty at @entity151 's apartment " feeling like a truck had hit me			1
" he identified them as flu - like symptoms , but following the guidance of the county doctor , he went to the clinic , and explained that he had been in the apartment			0
" at that point , i knew all the bells and whistles would start up , but at that point , it was out of my control because i had answered yes to the question , " he said			0
he broke down crying when he learned he did n't have @entity4 , @entity230 said			2
@entity249 director on @entity4 : ' only thing like this has been @entity251 ' @entity90 creates a committee in @entity90 , where a nurse 's assistant was confirmed to have @entity4 , authorities are taking measures to tackle the crisis			1

" to cover those jobs , the @entity90 health service is " making short term contracts hiring nurses that might be unemployed			2
" prime minister @entity286 visited @entity287			0
" the situation is n't a normal situation , " he said			0
