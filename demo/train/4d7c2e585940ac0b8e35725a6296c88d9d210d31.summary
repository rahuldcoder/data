-- i am , by no means , a regular patron of strip clubs			1
but because my show , " this is life , " explores different @entity6 subcultures without expressing opinion or judgment , i found myself in quite a few of them this year for the upcoming episode " @entity11 , " a window into the world of traveling strippers			1
stripping is hardly a new profession , but the @entity18 has allowed women who work in it to more easily access large groups of men congregating for leisure or for business : sporting events like the @entity26 or @entity28 championships , even political events like the @entity30			1
but because of the nature of what they do -- taking their clothes off for money -- strippers have been and will likely continue to be some of the most stigmatized members of society			1
i have n't really known too many strippers throughout my lifetime , but i 've admittedly fallen into the trap of not feeling particularly respectful of women who use their bodies to earn a living			1
perhaps it 's because of my perennial disdain for the objectification of women			1
but what happens when women themselves decide on their own to capitalize on their assets ? during the course of shooting this episode , i met many different kinds of women , but one thing was present in all of them : ambition			1
for some of the women , stripping allows them to make more money than other day jobs			1
some dancers use the job to put themselves through school , like @entity63 , who earned her master 's degree in literature and creative writing			1
others take advantage of the flexible schedule , like mothers who want to spend more time with their children			1
i do n't know any other job that allows for this kind of flexibility in schedule			2
if i want to spend more time with my child , i ca n't just choose when i work			2
they dance when they need money , but no one determines their hours but themselves			2
at many clubs , they are independent contractors who pay a percentage to the clubs for allowing them to dance there , but the rest of what they make goes into their pockets			2
that 's not to say it 's an easy life			1
the money can be highly unpredictable			2
a couple of dancers told me that there have been many nights when they 've returned home with less money than they left with , because guys just were n't feeling very generous			2
trying to remain upbeat and engaged is essential , even if you 're not having a great day			2
a good stripper is skilled in many art forms that go far beyond taking her clothes off			0
in many cases , she is a therapist or even a shoulder to cry on			0
strip clubs have reputations for being havens for drugs and sex trafficking for a reason -- pimps have been known to force women to work as strippers			1
but the clubs i visited do not condone drug use or prostitution			0
the former manager of @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 , told me that if he as much as suspects that a girl is being run by a pimp , he 'll throw them both out			0
so how did i feel in strip clubs ? frankly , i was utterly mesmerized			0
there is an art to seduction , and even if you 've been married for decades or you 're a devoted churchgoer , every one of us harbors the desire to be able to seduce or excite -- even our long - term partner			0
the way these women 's bodies move , the manner in which they play with their patrons : they are veritable masters of seduction , which is something that seems to have unquestionable value			1
so , why should n't these women capitalize on it ? a couple of nights , i went back to my hotel room to see if i could mimic some of the things i 'd seen in the clubs			1
i have a long way to go			0
in all relationships , we long to be able to maintain our partner 's attraction			0
let 's be honest , it takes work , especially if the relationship has spanned years and multiple children			0
a club owner told me that often , men spend time in his establishments and report going home to much friskier interactions with their wives			0
whether that is true or not , i know i was struck by how much sexier i felt			0
i wonder what would happen if we checked our opinions at the door ? if we 're lucky enough , we might run across someone like @entity63 and be able to discuss and debate whether @entity180 's " dark lady " was , in fact , a woman of ill repute -- and be thoroughly excited and entertained while at it			0
perhaps we could learn something			0
i know i did .			0
