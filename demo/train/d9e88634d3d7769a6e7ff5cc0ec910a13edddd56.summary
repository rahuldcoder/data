@entity0 -- with the @entity3 poised this week to hear arguments in the legal challenge to @entity7 's immigration law , it 's a good time to explain what this law and the ruckus surrounding it are really about			1
the left says it 's about racism and political extremism ; the right claims the issues are border security and public safety			1
in the two years since gov. @entity20 signed @entity21 into law , it 's become clear that this law , and the debate over it , are really about three things : fear , power , and freedom			1
as someone who lived in @entity33 and wrote for the @entity34 in the late 1990s , i can tell you that @entity36 only recently reached the conclusion that they wanted to get rid of illegal immigrants			2
the ' zonies i knew could n't live without them			0
not a lot of @entity43 citizens were lining up to do the hard and dirty jobs that the undocumented were doing			1
that includes landscaping or other jobs that require you to work outdoors in 115 - degree weather			2
in 1994 , when @entity52 passed @entity58 -- an anti-illegal immigration ballot initiative that intended to deny public services to illegal immigrants but was ultimately struck down by the courts -- and when president @entity53 launched " @entity57 " to beef up enforcement on the @entity43 - @entity56 border south of @entity0 , hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who had been headed to @entity52 took a detour through @entity7			1
those who crusade against illegal immigration in the @entity7 will say that this is when the " invasion " began			1
in truth , it was more like a gigantic job fair where employers eagerly gobbled up illegal immigrants to do everything from cleaning houses to raising children to cooking in restaurants			2
at the time , few people seemed concerned about verifying legal status			0
i once asked the crew washing my car at a popular @entity33 carwash if they had fake green cards , and one of the young men chuckled and said there was no need , since the employer never asked if they were legally eligible to work			0
fueled by illegal immigrant labor , cities like @entity33 boomed , and this was fine by the @entity89 -- many of whom envisioned their city growing into a desert metropolis with all the amenities			0
but the problem was that they were n't prepared for the demographic side effect : the fear that they were losing control , and the realization that whites would soon become a statistical minority in @entity7 just as they are in @entity52 , @entity104 and @entity56			1
something had to be done to readjust the ethnic balance			0
and that something was @entity21 , or as local activists have dubbed it : " the @entity108			2
" it 's about power			2
one of the main things that makes the law so controversial is also one of the things that the lower federal courts have said makes it unconstitutional -- that it essentially deputizes local and state police , who typically have n't been trained to enforce immigration law , and gives them the power to act as surrogates for @entity123			1
the @entity124 is pretty clear that regulating immigration policy is exclusively a federal responsibility , which is the reason that @entity58 was struck down			2
and the scores of police chiefs who resist enforcing federal immigration law are correct that it erodes the trust between law enforcement and local communities			1
but perhaps the best argument against giving local and state police this power is that they almost always misuse it			1
you see , this job is tougher than it looks , if you want to surgically remove illegal immigrants without harassing or disrupting the lives of @entity43 - born @entity144 , including some whose families have been in the @entity147 for nearly 500 years			1
that is especially true in the place that used to be called the @entity150			0
for those of us who support the role of federal agents to enforce immigration law , including deporting people when appropriate , the problem is n't that the law is being enforced			1
by all means , the law should be enforced			2
the problem is who is doing the enforcing			0
if the dirty work of asking people for birth certificates and other forms of identification to prove they have a legal right to be in this country is being done by amateurs , it is more likely that there will be mistakes			0
dark skins and accents will take the place of hard evidence and probable cause			0
civil rights will be trampled upon			0
that 's the concern in @entity7 , where state lawmakers made a power grab and foolishly gave local and state police officers something that most of them never wanted : the authority to enforce federal immigration law			1
that authority has to be held in check and closely monitored , and that is where the courts come in			0
this is the role that @entity43 district judge @entity194 fulfilled when , in july 2010 , she struck down some of the most grotesque parts of the law -- a requirement that local police determine the immigration status of individuals they suspect of being in the country illegally , a mandate that people carry documents that prove they have a legal right to be in the @entity43 , and a provision making it a crime for laborers to solicit work			1
and it 's about freedom , because @entity43 - born latinos should be free from harassment			1
they should n't have to prove they belong in their own country			0
in this case , they should be spared the additional humiliation of having to prove they have the legal right to be in a region to which they are indigenous			0
they have the right to be left alone without mischief - making bureaucrats or lawmakers calling their " @entity43 - ness " into question			1
they and their families have earned it the hard way -- by answering this nation 's call , enlisting in the military , and often making the ultimate sacrifice dating back to the days of the @entity238			0
conservatives get worked up over perceived threats to freedom all the time			0
whether it 's a smoking ban or a government mandate to buy health insurance , those on the right know how to raise a fuss over big government			0
what could be worse that police agencies using the blunt instrument of racial and ethnic profiling to ferret out suspected illegal immigrants ? how does government get any " bigger " than that ? this debate was never about the rights of illegal immigrants			1
it 's about the rights of those @entity43 citizens and legal residents whom the untrained and uninformed might mistake for illegal immigrants			1
it 's about the kind of country we 've always been , and the kind that we want to remain			0
we sometimes forget that personal liberty is the cornerstone of the @entity43			2
once again , it 's up to the @entity3 to remind us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity273 .			2

@entity273 : @entity7 's immigration law not all about racism or border security
@entity273 : it 's fear the @entity281 immigrants who made @entity7 boom will take over
it 's *dangerous* because it makes deputies out of local and state police , he *writes*
it 's also wrong , he says , because it takes away @entity43 - born @entity144 ' freedom
