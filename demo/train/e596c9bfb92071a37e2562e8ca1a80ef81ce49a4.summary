@entity0 showed up tuesday night talking about " binders full of women " being brought to him when he was governor			1
sounds kind of kinky and certainly not something you want to be touting			0
the phrase was part of @entity0 's answer to a question from an audience member at the second presidential debate about how he would " rectify the inequalities in the workplace			1
" referring to when he took over as @entity14 governor , he said , " i had the chance to pull together a @entity16 , and all the applicants seemed to be men , " he said			2
" i went to a number of women 's groups and said , ' can you help us find folks ? ' and they brought us whole binders full of women			1
" the " binders " moment went viral immediately on @entity29 , spawning @ @entity30 and @ womaninabinder @entity29 handles			2
as of wednesday morning , almost 300,000 people had supported a @entity33 page about what a politically dumb statement it was			0
@entity0 may soon say it was " inelegant " phrasing or he did n't finish his statement or some other excuse , but the comment shows why voters , especially women , do n't trust him and do n't believe he has their back			1
@entity42 : @entity43 snapped up in 90 seconds in fairness , " binders " was most likely a slip of the tongue			0
but @entity0 said it in an effort to obfuscate and pivot from the issue at hand : equality for women			2
he avoided the real question , and that , and his remark , spoke volumes			1
even as a slip of the tongue , this odd phrase betrays @entity0 's true lack of understanding , knowledge and comfort level on women 's equality			1
and besides the binders comment , there are several problems with the story @entity0 told tuesday night			1
first of all , it is not true			0
the " binder " of women 's résumés was prepared before the election by the @entity72 , a coalition of nonpartisan women 's groups			1
when @entity0 won , the women -- not in binders -- gave him the résumés			2
@entity0 told that story in an effort to demonstrate how well his administration had done in hiring women			1
a study by the @entity87 and the @entity88 shows that the percentage of women in senior positions during his tenure actually declined			0
it went from 30 % when @entity0 took office to 27 % when he left and up to more than 33 % after the new governor took over			0
did @entity0 undo gains with women ? also , it boggles the mind that throughout his decades - long career in business , @entity0 had not come across any qualified women he could appoint to his @entity16			2
the @entity0 campaign points to longtime aide @entity105 , but she was not in the @entity16			0
the more reasonable explanation is that diversity of gender , or any kind of diversity , was never an important tenet of corporate leadership for @entity0			0
which is why he did not proactively seek out the " binders full of women " : women 's groups , in fact , came looking for him			1
all of this goes to the heart of why @entity0 has had such a hard time winning over the women 's vote			1
he answered the audience member 's question from the standpoint of a detached ceo who knew that he had to find qualified women to serve in his administration come hell or high water , given the vast disparity between men and women holding management positions			2
he must have known he would be blasted if he did n't do it			0
in this day and age , this should be a no - brainer			0
you should not ask the @entity141 people to give you a medal for hiring qualified women			0
the dissonance when it comes to the governor and women went even further at the debate			0
@entity0 not only could n't answer the question about women ' equality , he could not even answer a question about outlawing @entity153 without bringing up single mothers			2
saying he did not believe in changing gun laws , he seemed to equate children raised by single parents with the " culture of violence			0
" i may be wrong , but i do n't think that is a good strategy to get struggling single moms to vote for you			0
tech : @entity167 world thumbs through ' binders full of women ' president @entity171 , in contrast , answered the equality question not just from a personal standpoint as a father but also as a commander in chief who signed a bill into law that guaranteed women could receive equal pay for equal work , the @entity182			1
@entity0 conspicuously never said whether he supported that act			0
the president 's approach was much more in synch with what women want to hear and with what all @entity141 know to be fair			0
the binders comment was even more unfortunate for @entity0 in that he said it in the midst of @entity171 's very strong showing			1
the president clearly showed that he had the fight , the passion and the commitment to continue to work for middle - class voters -- on jobs , on health care , on taxes , on education , on immigration and , yes , on women 's issues			1
this all underscores @entity0 's inability to really connect with voters			1
although he seemed to win a little more favor among women after the first debate , i predict binders of polling data as to why that movement stopped after tuesday night .			2

@entity0 's " binders full of women " debate remark is a viral *phenomenon*
@entity222 : he avoided the real question about rectifying women 's inequality
@entity222 : " binders " comment shows how out of touch @entity0 is with women 's issues
@entity222 : the story and his claims about hiring women in @entity14 are false
