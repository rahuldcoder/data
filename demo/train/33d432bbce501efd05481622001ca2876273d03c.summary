@entity1 's president declared states of emergency tuesday for three states , blaming " terrorists " aimed at " rebellion " who have caused " fear among our citizens and a near breakdown of law and order in parts of the country			1
" the order , issued by president @entity16 , applies to @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 states in northeastern @entity1			1
he also noted a rise of insurgent violence in eight other states as well , including @entity25 , where scores of police officers were killed last week			2
scores of police officers killed in central @entity1 " we have taken robust steps to unravel and address the root causes of these crises , but it would appear that there is a systematic effort by insurgents and terrorists to destabilize the @entity1 state and test our collective resolve , " @entity16 said in a televised speech			1
insisting they were n't simply criminals , the president said " terrorist groups " were staging a " rebellion and insurgency " that threatened @entity1 's " unity and territorial integrity			2
" some northern parts of @entity17 have already been taken over by such groups , as @entity16 noted			1
such violence over the years has been blamed on @entity51 , whose name means " @entity55 education is sacrilege			0
" according to @entity57 , the group has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict @entity61 law on largely @entity62 northern @entity1			2
attempts at dialogue -- which will continue , the president said -- have failed to curb militants ' efforts " to progressively overwhelm the ... country			0
" he cited several recent examples of violence , including the killing of " innocent civilians and state officials , " attacks on government buildings and facilities and the destruction of @entity1 's flag for " strange flags " instead			1
" these actions amount to a declaration of war and a deliberate attempt to undermine the authority of the @entity1 state and threaten her territorial integrity , " @entity16 said			2
" as a responsible government , we will not tolerate this			0
" the president said he 'll send more troops to the three states , adding that they and other security forces there have orders to " take all necessary action			0
" they have the authority to detain suspects and those who illegally possess weapons , take over any building " used for terrorist purposes " and conduct searches			0
" those insurgents and terrorists who take delight in killing our security operatives -- whoever they may be , wherever they may go -- we will hunt them down , we will fish them out , and we will bring them to justice , " @entity16 said			1
