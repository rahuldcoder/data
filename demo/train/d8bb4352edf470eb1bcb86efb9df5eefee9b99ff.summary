-- @entity1 held his nerve to steer @entity3 into the last four of the @entity4 and end @entity6 's 12 - year reign as champions			1
@entity1 struck a vital 57 not out to ensure co-hosts @entity3 reached their target of 261 with more than two overs to spare and book a semifinal clash with @entity13 rivals @entity14			1
earlier , captain @entity15 had hit an imperious 104 and @entity16 a quickfire 53 as @entity6 reached a competitive total of 260 - 5			1
but half centuries from @entity20 and @entity21 edged @entity3 towards their target before @entity1 and @entity23 propelled them over the line			1
after the game @entity1 told @entity26 : " the pressure was something else			0
people say it 's just another game , but beating the three - time champions i feel is really special for me and our team			2
" defeat came as a bitter blow to @entity15 , who has had to field questions about his future both as player and captain throughout the tournament , but he later insisted he would n't be stepping down			2
" we competed hard , there 's no doubt about that , " he said			0
" we thought we were in with a chance at the half - way stage , and that we had a reasonable total			0
" but we did n't bowl as well as we needed to , we needed more wickets from the middle order			0
it 's disappointing to be bowing out now			0
i wish @entity3 well for the rest of the tournament			0
" @entity6 made a quick start to their innings as @entity16 and @entity59 put on 40 but it was with @entity15 's arrival at the crease that the impetus began to grow			1
despite a shaky start , @entity15 soon punished some wayward @entity66 bowling to record his first century in 13 months , and despite @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 going cheaply @entity67 added a valuable 38 as @entity6 made 260 - 5			1
@entity3 reached 44 in their reply before @entity73 fell but @entity20 ( 53 ) and @entity21 ( 50 ) continued the charge with a partnership of 70 before the batsman known as " the little master " was dismissed by @entity78			0
when @entity79 and @entity66 captain @entity80 were removed in quick succession , @entity6 could sense the game changing			2
but @entity1 showed plenty of character to lead his side home , despite the calamitous run out of @entity21			2
@entity23 added a vital 34 and when @entity1 smashed the winning runs it sparked wild scenes of celebration in @entity92			0
meanwhile , @entity94 spinner @entity93 has flown home from the @entity4 because he is suffering from depression			1
the 30 - year - old , who took two wickets during his three games at the tournament , said on the @entity102 's website : " leaving at this stage of the @entity4 campaign was a very difficult decision to make			1
" but i felt it was the only sensible option for me and i wanted to be honest about the reason behind that decision			0
" @entity108 , the managing director of @entity94 , said : " i would like to offer my full support to @entity68 on behalf of everyone involved with the @entity94 team and the @entity102			0
" @entity68 has been an integral part of the @entity94 set - up in recent years and while he will be missed in the knock out stages of the @entity4 , our priority now is to ensure that he returns home to his family and is able to spend time recovering with a strong support network around him			1
