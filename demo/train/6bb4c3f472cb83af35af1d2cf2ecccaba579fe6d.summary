-- the upcoming @entity1 and @entity2 guarantee that @entity4 's international visibility will continue its rapid ascent			1
the country just has to ensure there are seats for all of the guests			0
@entity4 may be emerging from its reputation as the permanent " land of tomorrow , " but @entity12 suspects it will likely get there only at the last minute			1
as @entity4 's annual @entity16 hangover fades , a more serious road lies ahead			1
it 's crunch time for the @entity19 giant as it prepares to host next year 's football @entity1 and 2016 @entity2			1
the country definitely needs an economic boost given the recent downgraded forecast of barely over 1 % growth for 2013			1
hosting these mega-events was seen as an essential spark to get @entity4 to overhaul its dilapidated infrastructure , but despite the advance notice , politicians are n't yet living up to their continental scale ambitions			1
@entity4 excel at throwing massive parties , but so much is at stake beyond the @entity32			1
can @entity4 really become the " @entity34 , " unchallenged and indispensable to all its neighbors ? @entity4 wants to be the first superpower from the global south , yet with the equator just crossing a sliver of the country 's north , it has quite a long climb still to join the league of the wealthy , not just the large			1
@entity44 's technocrats have been aggressive , even creative , in recent years , using pro-poor policies and monetary intervention to deliver growth and stability			2
yet lower interest rate policy has failed to drive stronger investment , and business confidence is down due to government intrusions large and small in banks , car companies , and other sectors			0
even the major offshore oil discoveries have n't yet borne fruit for energy major @entity58 due to local content requirements that favor less sophisticated domestic suppliers			0
while its currency control policy has effectively been blessed by the @entity65 , the still massively overvalued @entity63 currency has undercut exports in what has been an increasingly diversified economy			0
@entity69 in general , and @entity4 in particular , has been the most urbanized region long before cities became the dominant meme of global socio - economic studies			1
@entity73 very much feels like the second - largest city in the world , but unlike even larger @entity77 , its airport feels third world and public transportation can scarcely cope with demand			0
it ranks alongside @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 in @entity87 's aptly named @entity86			2
and with close to 1,000 new cars joining the traffic jams each day , it 's no surprise that the rich take to the air : paulistas have the highest rate of private helicopter usage in the world			2
overall , the @entity99 's most recent @entity98 ranks @entity4 a measly 107 ( out of 144 ) for quality of infrastructure			1
since taking office just over two years ago , president @entity102 has regularly announced massive infrastructure investment schemes			0
airports , roads and railways have been slated for privatization , hundreds of new airports are planned to link the vast interior , the country 's development bank has pledged an immediate $ 10 billion in related spending , private banks are planning greater lending in the infrastructure space , a @entity73 to @entity118 bullet train has been announced for completion by 2020 , and $ 26 billion has been allocated to modernize the country 's 34 ports which are responsible for more than 90 % of the country 's annual $ 482 billion in trade			2
taken together , the government promises $ 100 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade , while raising $ 65 billion in privatization and auctions			0
discuss these numbers with any @entity4 , however , and they are apt to stare blankly and demand , " but where is all the money going ? " as popular a figure as former president @entity133 was -- and deservedly so for his innovative and transformative policies such as the targeted cash transfer program " @entity136 " -- corruption allegations still dog his still - dominant @entity138 ( @entity139 )			1
@entity141 , the leading daily newspaper , recently added a " corruption library " to its website to track the steady tide of suspicious contracts and spending			0
with the opposition parties fragmented and scattered , however , the @entity139 may well be in power long enough to be held accountable to its plans			0
as @entity4 focuses on its overhauling its cities , it must remember that urbanization itself wo n't drive meaningful growth , but rather empowering the tens of millions in the urban underclass			1
cities like @entity73 are designed for an industrial age while the urban economy has become 85 % related to services			0
the key question then is how to humanize such mega-cities , the theme of the upcoming @entity165 that @entity73 is hosting in june			0
( full disclosure : i serve on the @entity165 board of trustees			0
) the reinvention of @entity73 will begin right at its center with projects such as the @entity173 's @entity172			2
multiple mixed used social and commercial developments designed to be affordable and professional could help to reintegrate a population that has grown accustomed to gated communities			0
in such neighborhoods , @entity4 should find apprenticeships , vocational training , and more public libraries that promote literacy , social inclusion , and citizenship , all topics debated by world - famous architects and experts and locals together in a new series called @entity192 being held around the country			1
there is an opportunity to conduct this urban regeneration in a way that embodies @entity4 's amazing cultural depth			1
like @entity201 , the more modern it gets , the more @entity4 it gets ; its identity is enhanced rather than diluted			2
there is no higher symbol of this than fabled architect @entity207 's buildings , which manage to be both angular yet still in harmony with nature			0
but there are also efforts to restore the lifestyle of @entity213 , a tradition of street culture and music , rather than just an annual bonanza , and connecting @entity118 's favelas closer to its beaches through cable cars			0
in @entity73 , soccer pitches are being hastily laid in the outskirts to remind the nation that its best players have come from conditions of socio - economic adversity			0
the message is clear : @entity4 should resist overly consumerist temptations ; when they become too showy , they ( especially their soccer stars ) get distracted and under - perform			2
in the coming years , @entity4 's image will also be shaped by a new set of stars and issues			1
banks like @entity235 have a healthy balance sheet and appetite to expand across @entity69 and beyond			0
secondary regions like @entity239 are now rivaling @entity118 for visitors reveling in @entity16 culture , while @entity243 's capital @entity242 is attracting innovative industries to relocate			0
given that @entity4 holds approximately one - third of the world 's biodiversity and 20 % of its fresh water in the @entity250 rainforest , it is also becoming a leader in fields ranging from combating deforestation ( which has dropped by 80 % since 2004 ) to plant genetics			1
and @entity4 has become a leading and positive investor in @entity256 , as the country 's eloquent foreign minister @entity257 reminded participants at the recent @entity260			1
the upcoming @entity1 and @entity2 guarantee that @entity4 's international visibility will continue its rapid ascent			1
the country just has to ensure there are enough seats for all of the guests			0
@entity4 may finally be emerging from its reputation as the permanent " land of tomorrow , " but it will likely get there at the last minute			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity12 .			2

@entity4 continues preparations to host next year 's @entity1 and 2016 @entity2
it 's crunch time for the @entity19 giant , says @entity12
an economic boost is essential , says @entity12
politicians are yet to live up to their continental scale ambitions , he says
