-- it would have been unthinkable a matter of months ago , but could @entity3 be set to miss out on the @entity4 ? the 38 - year old failed to make the cut at this weekend 's @entity7 at @entity8 and looked far from content as he struggled with a back injury			1
@entity11 can not now automatically qualify for the bi-annual matchup between @entity13 and the @entity14 which will take place at @entity16 in september and is relying on a wildcard pick from @entity14 captain , @entity18 , to have any chance of making the roster			1
no doubt it was sore , " @entity22 's said of the injury when asked by reporters friday			1
" ( my body ) was telling me on the range it probably was n't a good idea , but i 'm not exactly a nonâ € ‘ stubborn person			2
" " i need to get stronger physically and be back to where i was			0
" @entity3 has missed out on much of the 2014 season with a separate back injury and has struggled for form since his return			1
he only just made the cut at the @entity37 in july and is currently ranked at no. 69 in the @entity14 standings			2
only the top nine players automatically qualify for the @entity4 team with three captain 's picks making up the full squad of 12			1
@entity11 wo n't be eligible for the @entity45 playoffs later this month meaning he will likely not play competitive golf before @entity18 announces his wildcards on september 2			0
@entity49 , who was widely praised for his @entity4 captaincy in a five - point win in 2008 , said he would not pick @entity11 for this year 's team			1
" i do n't think i would , " @entity49 told the @entity53			0
" i do n't see how you can take an injured player who is not playing well			0
" " and also @entity3 has not necessarily been the formula for success either			1
i just do n't see how you can pick him at this point			0
" i am guessing he will call @entity18 and beg out of this and say i am not ready , make @entity18 's decision easier			0
" woods told reporters friday he had not had any conversations about his participation with @entity18			0
when asked of the 14 - time major winner 's chances later in the day , @entity18 said that @entity3 would only be picked if he is " free of injury and he is playing well			1
" the @entity14 team has already been weakened by @entity72 's decision to take a break from the sport to seek " professional help " to deal with personal challenges			0
@entity72 was ranked fifth in the @entity14 standings before his withdrawal and would almost certainly have qualified automatically			2
there was further worrying news for the @entity14 earlier this week as two other likely automatic picks @entity82 and @entity83 both withdrew from the @entity7 event with back and neck injuries respectively			1
" we 're falling like flies right now , some of the players that are either on the borderline or on the team			0
that 's a concern , " @entity18 said			0
" ( but ) there 's time for recovery and there 's certainly a lot of golf to be played between now and september 2 when i make those three picks , " he added .			2
