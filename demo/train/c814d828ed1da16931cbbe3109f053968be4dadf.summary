-- a drive to turn @entity3 's only tropical island into a golfing haven is causing uproar among environmental groups			2
luxury golf resorts are springing up in all corners of @entity9 as the local government steps up its campaign to transform the island into the @entity13 of the east			1
the biggest project is @entity9 , a vast undertaking that when finished will have at least 10 courses and cover an area nearly one and a half times the size of @entity20			2
environmentalists are alarmed by the potentially damaging effects of golf course construction on an island featuring rainforests , mountains , volcanoes and more than 300 endangered species			1
" where does this begin and where does it end ? " said @entity29 , chief executive of the @entity30 , a non-governmental organization aimed at promoting sustainable golf			2
" what level of economic development can @entity36 sustain while still having functioning ecosystems ? you have to set a threshold on the level of development that can hit a region otherwise you will simply destroy its natural and cultural aspects , " @entity29 told @entity0			2
golf development in @entity9 has gone into overdrive since january , when the state announced plans to make the island an international tourist destination by 2020 , sparking a full - scale property boom			1
@entity53 is planning to compliment its three courses with a six or seven star hotel , while @entity56 has bought the land to open a second course			2
but those developments are dwarfed by the scale of @entity9 , where there are three courses , a 525 - room hotel , 11 restaurants and plans for three conference rooms , three shopping malls and a spa			1
in october , @entity70 actors including @entity71 and @entity72 will join multiple major winners @entity73 and @entity75 for the @entity76 , with the winner set to scoop $ 1.28 million			0
the sheer scale of development has also raised eyebrows at international environmental activists @entity81			1
" because @entity9 is known for its vast and dense rainforest , it is very important to @entity3 and to the world , " @entity82 , a forest campaigner for @entity83 , told @entity0			2
" any large - scale construction of golf courses would damage the local ecosystem			1
" we are very concerned about the rapid development of golf courses in @entity9 and we think the local government should take strong measures to ensure the golf projects do not damage the local ecosystems			1
" @entity98 , a @entity3 - based journalist who has visited the @entity9 complex in @entity9 , says although the development mostly occupies an area designated as wasteland , fruit trees have been uprooted and local residents displaced from their homes			1
he told @entity0 : " i met with the head of a local environmental group who thought he had secured rights to open up a forest park on part of the land			0
they had worked for years to get approvals from the government and local village groups			0
" then , all of a sudden , they were told their plans had been shelved			0
they soon found out the reason why			0
it was because of the @entity9 project			2
" @entity9 , which also owns a massive 12 - course golf complex in @entity124 on the @entity3 mainland , say their @entity9 project has created thousands of jobs and was subject to stringent environmental impact assessments			1
" @entity9 has always strived to balance economic benefits to the community with proper stewardship of the environment , " dr @entity129 , group executive vice chairman and group chief executive officer of the @entity131 , told @entity0 by email			0
" by incorporating low - density development with vast open - space greenbelts , our current project in @entity138 has transformed a barren , lava - rock landscape into an economically productive community			0
" their claims are backed up by the local government , with spokesman mr. @entity146 telling @entity0 that the location of the complex followed " careful " investigation			0
" therefore , the project will not pollute the environment , " he said			0
but those statements are not enough to pacify environmental groups , with @entity81 vowing to investigate the case			2
" you have to say that the @entity9 developments have been high - impact in environmental terms , " says @entity29			1
" you ca n't deny that when there 's the level of earth - shifting and movement of land form that there has been in the previous development			0
it 's large - scale and each development could n't really be defined as light touch			0
" then you have the longer - term concerns over where does the water come from , where does the energy come from ? is it all fossil fuels ? how much energy is required to desalinate or treat the sewage water ? " @entity178 , a golf course consultant on @entity9 for six years , says the sport can bring huge benefits to the island 's economy if it is kept in balance with the local infrastructure			1
" @entity30 is great for @entity36 and it 's a vehicle for bringing a lot of foreign exchange , but it 's got to be done carefully and within reason , " he told @entity0			1
" i do n't know who is regulating these people			0
you do n't want 50 golf courses but no buses and no sewage systems -- it 's got to grow together with everything			1
" @entity29 wants to see an end to the clandestine culture surrounding golf course construction in @entity3			0
" what we would like to see is more transparency , " he said			0
" we would like to see the government 's plans for the levels of development in @entity9 clearly depicted so that people can understand the levels and type of development that are likely to take place in such regions			1
" " there comes a point , particularly on an island setting , where too much development puts too much pressure on the natural resources , and the cultural heritage and the landscape of that particular region			0

@entity36 is at the center of an environmental row over development of golf courses
@entity9 has three courses , a 525 - room hotel , restaurants and plans for shopping malls
@entity81 alarmed by trend on island which has rainforests and rare species
@entity30 calls for transparency over course development
