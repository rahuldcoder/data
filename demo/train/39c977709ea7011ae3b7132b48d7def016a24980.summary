-- there was a time when @entity4 teams dominated @entity7 football 's second - tier competition , winning the @entity8 in six of seven seasons starting in the late 1980s			1
but the last @entity4 outfit to win the event , now the @entity8 , was @entity12 in 1999			2
no one would bet against @entity14 ending the drought this campaign and how sweet it would be for the @entity19 giant since the final will be held at @entity14 ' own stadium			2
the runaway leader in @entity23 , @entity14 reached the semifinals thursday after beating @entity25 2 - 1 in @entity19 and 3 - 1 on aggregate			1
for the ' @entity14 ' of @entity4 football , it marked a first @entity7 semifinal since the club lost the @entity31 final to @entity32 in 2003 -- before the ' @entity34 ' match - fixing scandal that resulted in @entity14 being stripped of two @entity23 titles and demoted			1
@entity14 was joined in the last four by @entity36 -- which made history in overturning a 3 - 0 first - leg deficit against @entity39 -- @entity40 and 2013 finalist @entity42			1
" this season , even though the competition is different , we are still having an important journey in @entity7 , " @entity14 manager @entity43 , whose men were ousted in the @entity31 last fall , was quoted as saying by the @entity49 website			1
" @entity14 had n't reached this phase in @entity7 for 10 years			1
" we 've got to keep our feet on the ground and not forget three years ago this team was n't even in the @entity8			0
" we have won a great deal over the last two years and are protagonists this season , too			0
the fans must stay close to the team for 90 minutes and i hope this can happen , so we never forget the past			0
we cared about reaching this objective and hope all of @entity4 can be happy with it			0
" @entity64 struck early for @entity14 before @entity65 leveled in the first half as the visitor enjoyed a good spell			0
@entity70 's own goal settled the affair in the 68th minute			0
" it 's not that just because we are called @entity14 we are greeted by a red carpet ushering us through to certain victory , " said @entity43			2
" anyone who thinks everything is easy just because we are @entity14 is deeply wrong			0
" iberian teams have been the ones doing well lately in the @entity8 , lifting the trophy in three of the four previous years , and thursday 's results ensured at least one more @entity82 side would feature in the may 14 finale			2
no club had ever rallied from 3 - 0 down in a tie to advance since the @entity8 was introduced but @entity87 's hat - trick inspired @entity36 in its 5 - 0 extra-time victory			1
@entity39 had two men sent off in extra time			0
@entity40 , the two - time @entity8 winner , trailed @entity92 1 - 0 after the first leg but three goals in the first 30 minutes at home were enough to see off the 2011 champion			1
even a red card to @entity98 in the 54th minute was n't enough to help @entity92 , which fell 4 - 1 on the night			0
@entity42 , beaten by @entity99 last year in the final , got a double from @entity102 to defeat @entity103 2 - 0 thursday and 3 - 0 on aggregate			1
the semifinal draw takes place friday .			0
