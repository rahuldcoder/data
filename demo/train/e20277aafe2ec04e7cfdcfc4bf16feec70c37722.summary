the detainee hunger strike at @entity1 is entering its third month			1
official reports say 100 of the detainees remaining at the detention camp are refusing food ; lawyers for the detainees say the number is closer to 130			1
twenty - three are being force - fed through nasal feeding tubes and at least 40 additional medical personnel have been flown to the base to help the overwhelmed staff care for those protesting their detention			2
last week , president @entity15 reaffirmed his position that the detention camp at @entity1 needs to be closed and that keeping detainees there without charge indefinitely " is contrary to who we are , it is contrary to our interests , and it needs to stop			1
" closing @entity1 was one of @entity15 's key 2008 campaign promises			2
five years later , the prison complex is populated with 166 detainees , 86 of whom have been approved for transfer to other countries , and is being considered for a $ 200 million renovation			0
opinion : why has @entity15 abandoned his @entity1 pledge ? nearly 70 % of the almost 800 detainees who have been held at @entity1 were released by the @entity36 administration			1
since then , some @entity38 officials have become increasingly worried about former detainees joining militant groups			0
a key reason @entity1 remains open is the fear that released inmates would mount terrorist attacks against the @entity38 , its interests and its allies			1
sen. @entity48 , a @entity50 @entity49 , for instance , last year called @entity1 detainees " crazy bastards that want to kill us all "			2
this view appears to be substantiated by government reports claiming many released inmates go on to join terrorist groups			2
last year the @entity38 director of national intelligence issued an " unclassified summary " estimating that the number of released detainees confirmed ( 15.9 percent ) or suspected ( 12.0 percent ) of joining militant groups was 27.9 percent			2
it is impossible to assess the validity of the government 's assertion that more than a quarter of former @entity1 detainees are confirmed or suspected to have joined a militant group because the government has not publicly released the names of former detainees who have " returned to the battlefield " since april 2009			1
the @entity73 analyzed @entity74 reports , news stories , and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have either joined or are suspected of joining militant groups since their release			0
the list is available here			0
of the 603 former detainees who have been transferred out of the prison camp , we identified only 17 individuals ( 2.8 percent ) who are confirmed to be engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities against the @entity38 or its citizens , while there are 21 individuals ( 3.5 percent ) who are suspected of engaging in such activities			0
we also identified 15 former detainees who are confirmed or are suspected of militant attacks against non- @entity38 targets ( 2.5 percent )			0
for the purposes of our study , for a former detainee to be considered " confirmed " that he had joined a militant group , there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities			0
for those " suspected " of such acts , there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities			0
released prisoners who simply made anti-american statements or propaganda were not considered to be confirmed or suspected to be part of a militant group			2
while it is possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly , we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like @entity121 and the @entity122 are eager to trumpet the identities of released @entity1 detainees who join their ranks and the media is also quick to highlight such stories			1
based on the public record , even if you combine all the released @entity1 prisoners who are confirmed or suspected to have taken part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world , the total comes to 53 , or 8.8 % , which is much lower than the 27 % being cited by the @entity38 intelligence community			1
this 8.8 % rate is also far smaller than the recidivism rate of criminals in the @entity38 , which currently stands around 67.5 % , according to the @entity141			0
interestingly , all but one of these former @entity1 detainees who joined militant groups were released under the @entity36 administration			1
under @entity15 , comprehensive threat assessments have been used to determine a detainee 's eligibility for release , which has contributed to the fact that of the 72 prisoners released under @entity15 we were only able to find one who had joined a militant group after his release			1
still , even if the number of @entity1 prisoners who have " returned to the battlefield " is quite small , they are certainly dangerous			1
take @entity161 , who co-founded @entity162 ( @entity162 ) in 2009			0
transferred to @entity163 in november 2007 during the @entity36 administration , @entity161 completed the kingdom 's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to @entity167 , where he became @entity162 's deputy commander			0
another example is @entity170 , who has emerged as a senior @entity122 commander			0
@entity170 was also transferred from @entity1 to @entity172 in 2007 by the @entity36 administration and rejoined the @entity122 shortly after the @entity172 government released him from custody			1
in 2009 , after the @entity167 - based @entity162 claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing of a @entity178 - bound airliner on christmas day , @entity15 issued a moratorium on all detainee transfers to @entity167			0
of the 86 detainees currently approved for transfer out of @entity1 , 56 are from @entity167			2
@entity183 then passed , and @entity15 signed , the @entity184 of 2011 which barred the use of government funds to transfer detainees into the @entity38 or into the custody of other countries unless certain security concerns , like maintaining effective control over the detention facility housing the detainees , could be met			2
so far , it has been close to impossible for countries in the @entity196 and @entity197 , where most of the remaining detainees are from , to meet the standards set in this legislation			0
yet the fact remains that 86 of the prisoners in @entity1 were cleared for release three years ago following a year - long investigation of their cases by an interagency task force of officials at the @entity209 , @entity74 , @entity210 and the @entity211			1
these detainees , some now on hunger strike , have good reason to despair that they will remain in @entity1 forever			1
their cases have been exhaustively investigated			0
they have found to be guilty of nothing , yet they are being held indefinitely			0
indefinite detention without charge is a policy that we usually associate with dictatorships , not democracies			1
add to this the facts that less than 3 % of the detainees at @entity1 can be confirmed by the public record to have engaged in anti-american terrorism or insurgent actions following their release and those 17 detainees were all released before the intensive review of the cases of the remaining prisoners at @entity1 began under the @entity15 administration in 2009			1
and so the @entity1 prisoners who have been cleared for release remain in seemingly perpetual custody , not because they 've been charged or because the rate of former detainees joining militant groups is at all high , but because @entity245 politics has effectively ensured that there is nowhere else for them to go			1
for these prisoners , attempting to starve themselves to death is an almost rational response to their bleak future			2
it 's a story that @entity253 might have written			0
unfortunately , this one is true .			0

@entity256 : @entity245 talks of @entity1 prisoners as major threat
he says small number of released @entity264 prisoners have returned to ' battlefield '
many prisoners are now engaged in a hunger strike , @entity256 says
@entity270 : indefinite detention without charge is a tool of dictatorship , not democracy
