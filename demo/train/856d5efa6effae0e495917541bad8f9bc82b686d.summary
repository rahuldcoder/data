@entity0 has lived , died and gone through a zombie apocalypse			1
and now , the comic book character is returning to tv			2
@entity0 ' prior big foray onto the small screen was " the @entity6 , " which aired on saturday mornings in the late 1960s			2
@entity7 is now bringing him back , as early as next fall , in a live - action show called " @entity10 " that promises to be pretty different from the traditional @entity11 we 're used to reading			1
( and we wo n't even go into the ill - fated 1990 nbc tv movie			2
) @entity16 spoke to writer @entity17 , who also does the creepy " @entity19 " comic books , about " @entity10 " after the series was announced thursday			1
@entity16 : how long has this idea been floating around ? @entity17 : it 's something we 've been talking about for a while			2
when [ publisher ] @entity25 and i first met , we talked about live action -- we actually were thinking about doing it as a movie			1
we even got so far as selling it to @entity32 , but we soon realized that there were many , many different stories we wanted to tell , and actually it was probably more suited to a tv show			1
it 's been in the works for a few years , but the stars are finally aligning			2
( @entity40 , like @entity16 , is owned by @entity41			2
) @entity16 : will the characters be recognizable as the @entity44 characters we know ? @entity17 : @entity44 's still gon na have red hair , @entity46 is still gon na have blond hair and @entity49 's gon na have dark hair			1
we are definitely not casting them retro - style to look like the comic book characters			1
they will definitely be contemporary kids			2
the pilot is set on the first day of school , after @entity44 was working for his dad 's construction company			2
he 's gon na be all buff and muscular , and that 's why all the girls fall for @entity44			1
we 're tweaking the mythology a bit to answer questions people have had for 75 years			0
@entity67 is still gon na wear that paper crown , it 's so iconic			0
we are explaining for the first time in 75 years why he 's wearing the crown			0
all these @entity73 eggs will have an explanation finally			0
they 'll look like their iconic selves but with an edgier quality			0
@entity67 will be more like @entity78			0
@entity16 : we hear the tone will be quite different from what we know			0
@entity17 : a lot of the subtext is bubbling to the surface			0
one of the big stories we 're telling in the pilot is that @entity88 and her mother , @entity89 , are moving to @entity10 because they 're fleeing a financial scandal that her dad is involved in			0
it 's very real world			0
@entity94 is a big character in the comic books			0
in the comics , he 's completely accepted as being gay , and there 's no question about that			1
in the show , we 'll look at what that really means for kids in a small town coming out -- who accepts them and who does n't accept them			1
@entity110 has always been a frat boy douchebag , and we 've never gotten to the core of why that is , and we 're going to explore that , it has to do with @entity110 's relationship with his parents			0
we 're getting to the realness and the complexity of the characters			1
we 're not going to arbitrarily make it dark , but we 'll get real with these characters and make it a little bit weird , like " @entity123 " or " @entity124 , " which is one of my favorite movies			1
@entity16 : but will it still be funny ? @entity17 : there will absolutely be humor in this			0
the voice will have a sardonic , ironic edge to it			0
the characters will be witty and funny , and every story will be a quintessential " @entity44 " story with a twist to it			1
the humor will always be part of the bread and butter			0
@entity16 : and the show will expand beyond the core characters ? @entity17 : @entity11 have thousands of characters in their library			1
one of the example is how " @entity150 " introduced the @entity148 and spun " @entity149 " off			0
we thought it would be great to have @entity153 as a rival band , and they can spin off their own show .			1

@entity11 characters will return to television in a live action series
the show will have as much in common with " @entity123 " as the comics
the show is aiming for next fall on @entity7
