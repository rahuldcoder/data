-- nearly all underage immigrants waiting for visas to stay in the @entity4 will have to start the process all over again when they turn 21 , the @entity1 ruled on monday			1
the 5 - 4 vote created an unusual bloc of justices with at least five different interpretations of the federal law at issue			0
the case deals with whether those seeking permanent status under a family preference provision , but then " age out " because of the often lengthy visa approval process , have a right to appeal the agency 's order reassigning them to the adults - only category			1
the majority agreed with the @entity25 administration , concluding the @entity26 made a " reasonable " interpretation of what the court called " ambiguous language " in the immigration application rules			1
in the face of such ambiguity , courts typically defer to the agency 's interpretation , as the justices did in this instance			0
the @entity1 appeal came from a @entity41 immigrant , @entity40 , who applied for visas on behalf of her and her 13 - year - old son			1
the lengthy process stretched past the young man 's 21st birthday , at which time he lost his " automatic conversion and priority date retention			0
" that meant he went to the back of the line to begin the application process anew to become a lawful permanent resident , which caused him to wait years longer for the visa			1
the appeal is not related to the recent spike of unaccompanied immigrant children coming over the @entity4 border from @entity61			1
federal officials last week had begun transporting about 1,000 such youngsters from @entity64 to @entity65 , as part of a resettlement process for the minors to their native countries			0
referring to an aged - out applicant , justice @entity71 said , " in the unavoidably @entity75 ¬ - sum world of allocating a limited number of visas , the board could decide that he belongs behind any alien who has had a lengthier stand - alone entitlement to immigrate			1
" " were we to overturn the board in that circumstance , we would assume as our own the responsible and expert agency 's role , " @entity71 added			0
" we decline that path			0
" under the court 's ruling , only a small group of young visa applicants would be eligible under the @entity92			1
that allows them to keep their priority underage status -- " @entity96 " as @entity71 put it -- throughout the immigration process , even after they turn into adults			1
but under complex immigration rules , which @entity71 again said parts of which were " through and through perplexing , " the government says several thousand other visa applicants age out of the process each year			0
some immigration groups had argued that could extend the wait in some cases by nearly a decade			0
the federal @entity111 allows @entity4 citizens and lawful permanent resident aliens to petition for certain family members to obtain visas to immigrate to the country or to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident alien			1
as @entity71 observed , " all of this takes time - and often a lot of it ... and as the years tick by , young people grow up , and thereby endanger their immigration status			2
" chief justice @entity125 agreed the board 's conclusions were reasonable , but he and justice @entity128 had a different idea of what made the law " ambiguous " in the first place			2
justice @entity133 was among three other colleagues who disagreed with the majority			2
" because the court and the @entity26 ignore obvious ways in which [ federal law ] can operate as a coherent whole and instead construe the statute as a self - contradiction that was broken from the moment @entity142 wrote it , i respectfully dissent , " she said			2
justices @entity145 , @entity147 and @entity148 also separately dissented			0
several current and former members of @entity142 had also opposed the administration 's interpretation of the rules			2
@entity154 sens. @entity153 of @entity155 and @entity156 of @entity157 , along with @entity160 colleagues @entity158 and @entity161 , were among 26 lawmakers who said the 2002 law they promoted would preserve family ties and not unfairly punish children who patiently waited for a visa			2
current efforts at broader immigration reform have stalled in @entity142			0
the case is @entity170 v. @entity171 ( 12 - 930 ) .			0

@entity1 ruling will *impact* nearly all underage immigrants waiting for visas to stay in the @entity4
the case involves those seeking permanent status under a certain family provision
