editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity11 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			2
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity11 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- for someone who likes to talk about the virtues of disconnecting , the media critic @entity24 seems surprisingly always on			1
when i visited him at his storefront office near his home in @entity31 on @entity32 , @entity8 , he was preparing to teach a new class , getting ready for a @entity35 interview , writing an essay , staring down a pile of articles to read , trying to figure out his new @entity39 , and hurrying to finish his third book in three years -- a graphic novel called @entity42 , which revolves around gaming culture , celebrity and the pharmaceutical industry			2
" it also asks the question , " he says , " what if attention deficit disorder were n't a bug , but a feature ? " the hyper - speed hyperlinked life is familiar ground for @entity24 , whose first book " @entity56 " made him a popular tour guide to the internet in the early 1990s , and an early prognosticator of its radical potential			1
but much has changed between the awkward days of " the ' net " -- then a non-commercial collection of public networks accessed by local @entity63 -- and the overloaded era of @entity65 , @entity66 and iphones			0
if @entity24 is well - versed in the language underneath the " digital revolution , " he 's also become one of its most outspoken critics			1
" a society that looked at the internet as a path toward highly articulated connections and new methods of creating meaning is instead finding itself disconnected , denied deep thinking , and drained of enduring values , " @entity24 writes in his recent " @entity74			1
" his remedy is simple , if ambitious : once people begin to understand how software works , " they start to recognize the programs at play everywhere else			0
from the economy and education to politics and government , all systems have embedded purposes			0
the less we recognize them , the more we mistake them for given circumstances			0
" understanding how things work in order to make them work better is the basic hacker ethos , but @entity24 has applied it to his broader discussion of the way the culture and politics of the many are driven by the interests of the few			1
between his landmark documentary " @entity116 " to his recent book " @entity118 , " @entity24 has indexed the risks that capitalism and corporate influence pose to democratic society			1
or , to extend the metaphor , he 's sought to show how we the users routinely get screwed by an " operating system " that 's more than 500 years old			0
see the rest of " @entity24 in @entity123 " at @entity9 " we 're leveraged in so many ways , it 's like , our economy is leveraged to produce more than it can in order for it to survive , " he says			1
" it 's leveraged to grow			0
human beings are financially leveraged now			0
so how do you roll that back and say , well , you know , ' this is it ' ? " or , rather , " how do you get the good of a zombie apocalypse without the zombies ? that 's sort of what i 'm trying to help people with			0
@entity24 has watched the movement with cautious optimism , penning editorials on @entity3 and organizing november 's @entity147 , a powwow of net roots activists and open source hackers working to foster new civic - minded apps and hardware			1
to include prizes , @entity24 enlisted the help of @entity155 , which ultimately granted $ 10,000 to the @entity156 , which was profiled in our recent documentary			1
rather than shun corporate sponsors , @entity24 revels in what they bring to the table , and in the contradictions of the movement			1
@entity143 's power , ultimately , is its meme -- the idea that a citizenry can not only protest the system but demonstrate a new way of responding to it and reworking it			0
like his call to program , @entity143 's nebulous mission may be hard to swallow or carry out			0
but that also lends it its own kind of power , he says			0
its radical promise is n't unlike the earlier internets : a distributed and open system that could change civic discourse and remake culture			0
but as on the strange battlefield of the @entity186 , @entity143 could also crash against its own giant ambitions , which will be heavily tested in the next few months			1
progress will have to be made gradually , says @entity24			1
" there are ways to slowly move towards a sustainable life path , and it 's just a matter of doing that , and i 'm hoping that more people in @entity143 start seeing it that way -- in that more subtle way , rather than exclusively in the kind of activist , let 's - get - pepper - sprayed by cops way			0
" much has changed in the decades since @entity24 started critiquing the system			2
but his philosophy is still animated by a big question , one that applies not only to the digital spaces of the @entity186 , built by the @entity206 and the @entity207 , but to other kinds of " public " spaces too , in town squares , @entity211 , and culture : who programmed these spaces , and to what ends , and how can they be hacked into something better ?			2
