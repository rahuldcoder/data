@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sky is overcast , the wind is howling , and - like every day in @entity1 - lashing rain could come at any moment			1
yet @entity7 is walking on a sunbeam			0
this summer , @entity7 will be working in @entity9 for a firm managing the 2012 @entity12 summer games			0
the position is a major coup for the @entity16 student , largely because the prospects in @entity1 are dim			1
" it 's quite limited , " @entity7 explains			0
" we 're such a small country , we do have certain events , but they are on such a small scale compared to other countries			0
" finding a job in @entity1 , @entity7 says , can be a difficult task - especially for young adults			1
the @entity1 economy is in the toilet			1
double digit unemployment , high government debt and a glut of unoccupied housing have silenced the roar of the @entity35 , and left many of its cubs struggling to find employment			0
" i 've had a few interviews and things but it 's really , really tough , " says @entity40 masters student @entity39			0
" there are an awful lot of masters students going for the jobs in @entity1 at the moment , and it 's very difficult for us with just degrees to get a job			1
" for those without degrees , the job search is even harder			0
according to the @entity1 government , a third of young men under 25 are unemployed , in large part because of the failing housing market			1
many young carpenters , bricklayers , plumbers and electricians have left the island country for @entity64 or @entity65 , two countries where building is still a strong sector in the economy			2
contractors in those countries have been quick to exploit the influx of young , semi-skilled workers			2
but @entity7 says the mass emigration of construction workers has made it difficult for young white collar @entity1 workers to find employment outside of @entity1			1
" i definitely feel like we 're being [ painted ] with the one brush , " says @entity7			0
" they think of us as being skilled in electric , or like plumbers and brick layers , but there 's a lot more to the @entity1 culture and the @entity1 people			1
" with each generation , emigration emigration is a rite of passage for many young @entity1 adults looking to explore new cultures and gain a global outlook			1
take @entity96 - long before he became an economist , he left @entity1 to attend college in @entity99			1
but now many of those leaving the country have already been educated and are looking for employment , @entity100 says			0
" you have one person emigrating every seven minutes out of @entity1 , adding up to about 66,000 every year , " @entity100 says			1
" it 's substantial , it 's a very educated portion of the population , and a very young part of the population			2
" many @entity1 economists , including @entity100 , are concerned a prolonged ' brain - drain ' could further slow the country 's financial growth			1
" these kids [ that are leaving ] are clever and hard working , " @entity100 explains			0
" immigration is quite self selecting			0
those that go tend to be the ones with more get up and go , so you lose an enormous demographic catalyst to growth and to prosperity			0
" previous @entity1 emigrants say they also notice a stark difference in the mood of the country during this period of exodus			1
@entity132 lives in @entity133 , on @entity1 's west coast			1
@entity132 says after he came back to @entity1 from the @entity136 in the 1990s , there was a sense of optimism as the country began to excel economically			2
now , @entity132 says , many young emigrants have little idea when they 'll return			1
" everybody is touched by it , " @entity132 says			0
" i have nephews that have left , i have friends that have left			0
and i always think it 's a good thing for any young person to go away and learn another culture and another language			2
but the unfortunate thing is the vast majority are leaving because there is absolutely nothing here			0
" that sense of hopelessness seems to permeate throughout @entity1 , as frustrated family members and job seekers vent to radio call - in programs and newspapers			2
as one woman recently wrote in the @entity164 , emigration used to feel like a life style choice			2
now , " it feels like a life sentence			0
" is ' laziness ' fueling emigration ? for some young @entity1 adults , the mass emigration is more of a fad than necessity			1
as more young @entity1 leave , these critics say , the ones that stay behind feel like they are left out of a mass cultural experience			1
" at the moment , all i 've heard is positive feedback because they 're in a different country and they 're young and they 're living the life , " says @entity1 student union vice president @entity178			1
" it 's just kind of a thing where half the people i went to school with are over there now and they just are going around delivering pizzas and just doing part time jobs that have no relevance to their future , " @entity178 says			2
" i think there 's a certain laziness as well , " adds @entity178 , who believes some people are using the poor economy as an excuse to party abroad			2
there are no wide demographic studies showing why young @entity1 adults are leaving			1
meanwhile , a small number of entrepreneurs have returned to @entity1 after starting successful companies in @entity1 , @entity206 and @entity64			2
overwhelmingly on blogs and other online postings , young @entity1 adults express anxiety about their country 's economy , and seem ready to embrace better financial opportunities abroad			1
yet others , like recent college graduate @entity213 , seem to view emigration as a chance to add some excitement to life			0
@entity213 plans on moving to @entity219 to live with her cousin			0
trained as a personal care assistant , @entity213 says she 's looking for bar work in @entity9 as a way to meet new people			0
" i did special needs assistance and i 'm qualified in that , but there 's no jobs for that at the moment [ in @entity1 ] , " @entity213 says			2
asked if she thinks whether there might be jobs in her field in @entity9 , @entity213 pauses for a moment before laughing			0
" yeah , i did n't really think about that ! " @entity213 says .			0

one third of @entity1 men under 25 are unemployed
many of the young emigrants are *extremely* skilled
some young people blame emigration on laziness
