@entity1 student @entity0 and her former @entity3 boyfriend @entity2 have had their sentences in the murder case of @entity9 student @entity7 upheld by an @entity3 court			1
@entity11 , who is currently living in the @entity1 , had her sentence increased to 28 years and six months			1
@entity2 , who returned to @entity3 during the trial , was sentenced to 25 years			1
why were @entity11 and @entity2 back on trial ? in 2009 , they were convicted of killing @entity16 , 21 , who was found stabbed in november 2007 in the villa that she and @entity11 rented in the central @entity3 university town of @entity19			1
the convictions of @entity11 , from @entity21 , and @entity2 were overturned in 2011 for " lack of evidence			1
" but @entity3 's @entity24 decided in march 2013 to retry the case , saying the jury that acquitted them did n't consider all the evidence and discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered			1
what was different about this trial ? despite the ruling of the @entity24 , there was little difference in the evidence or details of the case , and prior to thursday 's verdict it was unclear how presiding judge @entity41 would rule			2
when @entity11 was first convicted of murder , there was outcry in the @entity1 that she was wrongfully convicted , based on shoddy evidence			1
when she was acquitted , there was nearly as much of an outcry in @entity3 that the courts had succumbed to @entity1 pressure			1
timeline : kercher murder case did the defendants attend the retrial ? the retrial began on september 30 without either of them in court			1
@entity2 was in the @entity59 at the start of the retrial but returned to @entity3			1
he took the stand in november , defending himself			0
" i would like to make you understand that these charges against me are absurd , " he said			0
" there was not a basis to charge me , to put me in jail			0
... i do n't wish anybody on @entity69 to go through what i went through			0
" he said that evidence against him -- including a knife that was a key part of the prosecution 's case -- was " an illusion			2
" @entity11 returned to @entity21 after her 2011 acquittal and has been living there since			2
she says she is afraid to return to @entity3 , where she spent four years behind bars			2
she again maintained her innocence in a written statement to the @entity84 court			0
" i must repeat to you			0
i did not rape , i did not steal ... i did not kill @entity7 , " @entity11 said a lengthy e-mail , written in @entity3 , which was presented to the court by her lawyer			1
what will happen to @entity11 now ? despite thursday 's verdict , the case is not necessarily closed			1
either side can appeal a verdict they are unhappy with , under @entity3 's three - strike trial system			1
this could also mean the case would continue with no immediate outcome			0
even though @entity11 was convicted this time around , it is unclear if she will return to @entity3			1
@entity102 's legal analyst @entity101 said that @entity1 law dictates that a person can not be tried twice on the same charge			1
" because of this tension between @entity3 and @entity1 law it is unlikely that @entity1 law will extradite her			1
when the fight begins those are the grounds that @entity1 attorneys will be arguing			2
" however , another legal expert disagreed			1
" they always forget she was convicted first , " @entity114 , who teaches transnational law at @entity116 in @entity117 , told @entity118			0
if @entity3 does file an extradition request with the @entity122 , @entity11 will have the right to challenge her transfer to @entity3 in a @entity1 court			1
" the chances of her winning that are not high because there has to be some very strong claim she 'd have to make to block her extradition , " @entity114 added			0
" i followed the trial , it was slow but i never got the sense that it was unfair , " he said			0
@entity138 law professor @entity137 added : " as popular as she is here and as pretty as she is here -- because that 's what this is all about , if she was not an attractive woman we would n't have the group love - in -- she will be extradited if it 's upheld			0
" the @entity3 legal system , though i do n't love it , is a legitimate legal system and we have a treaty with @entity3 so i do n't see how we would resist , " he told @entity118			2
" we 're trying to get ( fugitive @entity155 leaker @entity154 ) @entity153 back -- how does it look if we want @entity153 back and we wo n't return someone for murder ? " he asked			0
there is a valid extradition agreement between @entity3 and the @entity1 , but the @entity1 has not set much of a precedence in returning suspects for such matters			1
@entity3 point to a number of high - profile cases over the years in which they say @entity1 suspects have been accused of wrongdoing and criminal acts , but have been let off lightly			2
in 1998 , an @entity1 military jet clipped a ski lift cable , sending a gondola of 20 passengers to their deaths in the @entity3 @entity176			2
@entity3 prosecutors wanted the crew of the jet tried in @entity3 , but an @entity3 court ruled they should face courts - martial in the @entity1 , in accordance with @entity184 treaties			2
the aircraft 's pilot and navigator were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter , even though the military admitted the plane had been flying lower and faster than authorized			0
when it emerged that a video that captured the accident from inside the plane had been destroyed , they were dismissed from the @entity196			0
@entity3 were outraged , referring to the incident as the " massacre of @entity199			0
" in another incident that raised tensions , @entity201 cleric @entity200 was seized off the streets of @entity205 in 2003 and smuggled to @entity201 , where he says he was tortured and released four years later			0
although @entity3 did not request the extradition of any of the suspects , 22 @entity207 agents were convicted in absentia of the kidnapping and sentenced to prison time for their role in the abduction , but none ever served time in @entity3			0
what will happen to @entity2 now that he has been found guilty for a second time ? because @entity2 is an @entity3 citizen and currently living in @entity3 , he will not have to face extradition			1
he is unlikely to be jailed until his appeal has been heard -- and that could take months -- but authorities ordered that his passport be revoked			0
hours later @entity3 authorities stopped @entity2 in the northern @entity3 town of @entity226 , near the border with @entity228 and @entity229 , police said			2
what has been the reaction of @entity16 's family ? the @entity16 family has welcomed the ruling , which overturns the previous decision to acquit @entity11 and @entity2			1
" they are tired of this and want justice , " @entity236 , the family 's attorney , said			0
" i think we are still on the journey to the truth , " said @entity16 's sister @entity241			2
" i think it may be the fact that we do n't ever really know what happened that night , which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with			0
" @entity250 , @entity7 's brother , said the family may have to wait until spring 2015 for a final resolution , since the verdicts reached thursday can still be appealed at @entity3 's @entity24			1
" nothing is going to bring @entity7 back , nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her , " he said			0
" the best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion , having a conviction , and everyone can move on with their lives			0
