@entity0 , @entity1 -- three @entity4 soldiers detailed the shooting death of their platoon leader for an @entity1 judge sunday in an effort to preserve a case that will be tried months after @entity4 troops have left the country			1
it is one of a number of cases in recent months where a @entity4 military attorney and an @entity1 prosecutor have worked together to bring charges against those accused of targeting @entity4 troops , though it is one of the first murder cases to be brought before a judge just weeks ahead of the @entity4 pullout from @entity1			1
" today , we came to court to preserve the testimony of soldiers in a pending criminal case that will be tried in an @entity1 court , and we bring the testimony today because the @entity4 forces are going to be gone soon , " @entity26 maj. @entity25 , an attorney working on the case , told @entity2			1
the @entity4 military took the step of having @entity4 soldiers provide testimony because " we are no longer going to be able to show up here in the court , " @entity25 said			1
the november 3 shooting of 1st lt. @entity42 -- one of the last @entity4 casualties in the more - than - eight - year @entity1 war -- was chronicled by insurgents who captured the sniper shooting on video and posted it online			1
inside a crowded courthouse , one of the soldiers who was with the 25 - year - old @entity42 the day he was killed told the investigative judge that a " few days later a video was posted that claimed the killing of the 1st lieutenant , and it shows the same location we were that day			2
" the video , which was played for the judge , was set to music and showed what appeared to be a soldier on the top of an armored vehicle , at a distance from the camera			0
on his back , which was to the camera , was a superimposed sniper 's crosshair cursor			0
then there is the sound of a gunshot , and the soldier drops from view			0
his comrades testified that @entity42 , of @entity79 , @entity80 , was killed when his convoy stopped in @entity0 's volatile @entity83 district , a mixed @entity86 - @entity85 neighborhood in the northern @entity1 city			1
the convoy stopped to fix an electrical cable on the top of one of @entity42 's armored vehicles -- " then we heard a shot , " one of the soldiers told the judge			0
two of the soldiers testified they got out of their armored vehicle to aid @entity42 , who was shot in the upper right portion of his chest			0
" he was wearing a vest , but it hit the upper side of the vest , " the same soldier said			0
later , the soldiers said , they were told @entity1 police apprehended a suspect			2
the @entity4 soldiers who testified are still carrying out missions in @entity1 and are not being identified at the request of the @entity4 military			1
@entity25 asked to submit the case to the court on behalf of the @entity26			2
the @entity1 prosecutor , who also asked not to be identified as a security precaution , said the case against the suspected sniper could take up to seven months before it is decided by the court			1
in addition to the testimony of the soldiers and the video , the prosecutor told @entity2 other evidence was presented to the judge			0
" we told the judge that we have witnesses and a secret witness , and we will try to bring him to court as soon as possible , " the prosecutor said			0
it was not clear who the additional witnesses were , and the prosecutor did not identify them out of a concern for their safety			0
the @entity4 military has successfully pressed for the prosecution of four people who have been convicted in recent months of targeting @entity4 personnel at @entity137 , the @entity4 base on the outskirts of @entity0 , with rockets or roadside bombs			1
" i think in @entity0 , it 's a big step that at least they allow us to come here to the courthouse , and here we have seen some real results lately , " @entity25 said			2
" they have been willing to take on the cases of the terrorists who have attacked the @entity4 troops , and i think that is a real good sign			1
" @entity42 is the second @entity4 soldier to be killed in @entity0 in a little more than a month			1
a rocket attack in late september killed spc. @entity154 , 23 , of @entity155 , @entity156 , and wounded at least four others			0
while violence has fallen off across much of @entity1 , bombings and shootings are a near - daily occurrence in the disputed city , which is home to nearly a third of the country 's oil reserves			2
@entity0 is populated by ethnic @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity85			0
tensions among the groups run high in the city , to which the @entity1 government in @entity172 and the semi-autonomous @entity174 region have both laid claim .			0
