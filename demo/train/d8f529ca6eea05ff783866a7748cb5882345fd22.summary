-- @entity1 may be most at home on a clay tennis court , but he has always found comfort on the sea			1
the " @entity1 " has racked up countless titles on his favored surface , but hailing from the island of @entity10 , the @entity8 has also been the scene for much personal enjoyment			1
there was no better way , then , for @entity1 to gear up for this week 's @entity17 @entity16 than to sail around @entity19 's harbor while being treated to spectacular views of the @entity22 coastline			1
the world no. 1 -- who is looking to reclaim his title in the principality after @entity27 ended his eight - year reign in 2013 -- jumped on board the @entity30 , manning the rudder and learning the ropes of how to sail the @entity34 's flagship			1
" it was a wonderful way to enjoy an afternoon , " @entity1 told the @entity17 @entity17 's official website			1
" it was a special experience for me			2
i am from an island , so the sea , the sails and everything involved means a lot to me			0
" @entity1 , who will also be looking to avenge last month 's @entity44 final defeat to @entity27 , still lives in the @entity10 town of @entity46 where he was born			1
but while the 27 - year - old is more likely to be found on a motor boat than a sailing ship in the waters outside his house , his experience in @entity48 has left a lasting impression on him			1
" i spend a lot of time on the sea when i 'm at home , especially in the summer			0
i live in front of the sea and the port is three minutes from my home , " he said			0
" i do n't go sailing very often			0
i go more often on a motor boat			0
i do n't have much time at the moment for sailing , maybe in the future			0
" the way that the crew are working together to make the boat perfect and go faster is amazing			0
everybody works for one goal			0
it 's a special thing			0
" @entity1 is due to open his bid for a ninth @entity16 title wednesday and he will be hoping to add to this season 's previous wins at the @entity79 and @entity80			1
@entity27 , meanwhile , started the defense of his crown tuesday with a straight - sets win over @entity86 qualifier @entity84 , winning 6 - 1 6 - 0 in the second - round match after receiving an opening bye			1
the world @entity89 comes into the tournament on a 10 - match winning streak , having won back - to - back masters titles at the @entity96 hard - court events in @entity97 and @entity44			2
he is aiming to become only the fifth player to successfully defend his title in @entity48 , following @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity1			1
@entity105 ninth seed @entity103 also won his second - round match , beating @entity108 's @entity107 6 - 4 1 - 6 6 - 4			2
@entity103 's compatriot @entity109 crashed out , losing his first - round tie 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4 to @entity113 qualifier @entity111			2
