-- " @entity2 v @entity1 : @entity1 " takes @entity3 's @entity1 to new places , but one thing remains the same : the hero 's iconic suit			1
on thursday , @entity8 shared the first image of @entity3 suited up as @entity1 , with the " s " on his chest firmly in place as he stares through a grim - looking rain			1
the photo comes just a few days after @entity3 was spotted on the set of " @entity1 " dressed as @entity1 's alter - ego , @entity18			1
" the more time i spend with @entity3 , the more he 's @entity1 to me , " director @entity19 told @entity21 of the @entity23 actor , who made his debut as the high - flying hero in 2013 's " @entity27			1
" now , with the " @entity27 " sequel " @entity2 v @entity1 : @entity1 , " @entity3 and @entity19 are eager to stretch the kryptonian 's identity , examining who he is as a protector of @entity33 and as an everyday gent			1
he 'll still be working with @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and @entity37 ( @entity38 ) at the @entity39 , but he 'll also find himself moving into @entity40 , where @entity41 ( @entity42 ) presents a threat			0
" we 've both created this guy , and we can push him around a little bit , " @entity19 said			2
but will it be @entity48 's @entity2 doing the pushing ? after all , this will be the first time that @entity2 and @entity1 are on the big screen together			2
@entity19 would n't say , but he did point out that the movie title 's spelling is intentional			1
using a " v " instead of a " vs " was " to keep it from being a straight ' versus ' movie , even in the most subtle way , " he told the paper			0
" it 's never really been done and it 's kinda cool			0
" " @entity1 " also brings in a number of other characters , including @entity63 ( @entity64 ) and @entity65 ( @entity66 )			0
as for @entity48 's @entity2 , @entity19 told the paper fans should expect a weary , seasoned take on the character			2
" it 's cooler to see a crusty old @entity2 beating the snot out of guys , " @entity19 said			0
" @entity2 v @entity1 : @entity1 " is currently in production , and scheduled for a may 6 , 2016 release .			0
