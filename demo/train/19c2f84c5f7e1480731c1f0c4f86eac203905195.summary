the high intensity routine was brutal at first			1
they were doing 50 yards of lunges , 50 yards of backpedals , sprinting for 50 yards and power walking one mile around the track to help him reach his target heart rate			0
up to that point in his life , @entity15 had n't even managed a single push - up			1
the second win to stay motivated , he turned the compliments from his friends , family and peers into fuel -- fuel to get him through his tough workouts , to curb his cravings and to keep the promise he made to himself to lose the weight and keep it off for good			2
" every single day since 2011 , someone has made a comment regarding my weight loss			0

a piece of sugar - free candy , a low - carb dessert or diet soda is enough to do the trick			1
to compensate for these treats , he increases physical activity and keeps the portions extra small			0
