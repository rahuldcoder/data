@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 government said thursday it will pay compensation to the relatives of those killed and wounded by @entity4 soldiers in the @entity10 shootings in @entity1 in 1972			1
thirteen people died when @entity4 troops opened fire at a mainly @entity15 civil rights march in @entity16 , and another man died four months later of injuries sustained on that day			1
last year , prime minister @entity19 described what happened in @entity16 as " unjustified and unjustifiable , " following the release by the @entity4 government of a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings			1
the paratroopers who killed 14 people had no reason to believe they were under threat from the victims , gave no warnings before firing and lied to the far - reaching official inquiry into the seminal event , the inquiry concluded			0
the independent @entity34 was a comprehensive rejection of the @entity4 government 's official account of the killings , which had stood for 38 years			2
lawyers representing the affected families wrote to @entity19 demanding compensation			0
the families now say @entity4 's @entity42 has replied , saying it wants to " resolve the compensation question as quickly as possible			1
" " we acknowledge the pain felt by these families for nearly 40 years , and that members of the armed forces acted wrongly			1
for that , the government is deeply sorry , " a spokesman for the ministry said thursday			0
" we are in contact with the families ' solicitors and where there is a legal liability to pay compensation we will do so			0
" however , the relatives of one of the victims -- 19 - year - old @entity58 -- say they want the soldiers involved to be prosecuted for murder and will not accept the compensation			2
the relatives branded the @entity4 government offer " repulsive " and said they would not accept a payment " under any circumstances			2
" @entity10 is widely accepted as fueling support for the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) during the early years of what became known as @entity71 -- 30 years of violence between @entity74 and @entity75 forces			1
even the name of the city where it happened is disputed , with @entity75 nationalists calling it @entity16 and @entity82 unionists calling it @entity16			0
the @entity68 , a republican paramilitary organization , is listed by the @entity84 as a proscribed terrorist group			0
the @entity71 claimed about 3,000 lives over a three - decade period , with 1972 the single bloodiest year			0
the @entity74 @entity87 has called for @entity68 victims to be compensated by the @entity4 government .			2

the @entity42 says it acknowledges the pain felt by families
@entity4 troops shot dead 13 people and a 14th later died of his injuries
a report last year found that @entity4 soldiers were to blame in the *massacre*
@entity10 is widely accepted as having fueled violence in @entity1
