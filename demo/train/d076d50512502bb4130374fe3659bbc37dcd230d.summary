@entity0 -- foreign aid , a topic often overlooked on the presidential campaign trail , seems to sport a giant bull 's - eye among @entity6 this election season			1
@entity6 presidential hopeful @entity8 proposed setting foreign aid accounts to zero if elected			1
one of his opponents , @entity11 , suggested last month that @entity12 should bear more responsibility for direct humanitarian aid abroad , instead of collecting interest on loans to the @entity17			2
these candidates and others imply that cutting this one - line item is the key to balancing our federal budget and a near panacea for economic woes at home			1
understandably , @entity6 candidates have focused inward in their stump speeches , promising to create jobs and stimulate our sluggish economy			2
@entity17 rightly are worried about their own livelihoods and bank accounts			2
in tuesday 's @entity6 debate being aired on @entity1 , i urge the presidential candidates not to dismiss the lifesaving work done overseas by nonprofit organizations such as those i represent			1
not only is helping others part of this country 's moral fabric , but it also makes fiscal sense for the @entity17 and , thus , for voters ' wallets			2
just as @entity17 ' systematically examine their own family 's spending decisions , i suggest that @entity6 presidential candidates apply similar personal finance principles to evaluate why foreign aid is worth the investment			1
do n't be penny wise but pound foolish emergencies and disasters are inevitable -- from natural calamities to catastrophic illness			0
financially savvy @entity17 know to protect their assets by spending small amounts on insurance and other precautionary measures			0
foreign aid is this nation 's insurance			1
first , the investment -- like an insurance premium -- is relatively small			0
foreign aid comprises less than 1 % of the federal budget			1
secondly , experts agree that small cash outlays can prevent major expenses later			0
for example , droughts happen everywhere -- from @entity74 to @entity75			0
what is not inevitable , however , is famine			0
in places such as @entity74 , @entity83 and @entity84 , investments in agriculture techniques , good storage facilities and infrastructure have allowed people to plan for the unexpected			0
the @entity74 drought , which affected 70 % of the state , did have a ripple effect on food and cotton prices worldwide			0
but no @entity91 starved to death			0
similarly , in @entity75 earlier this year , long - term farming and food infrastructure investments in @entity83 and @entity84 meant that this year 's drought in these countries was far less catastrophic			0
in @entity99 , by contrast , the famine has put the lives of millions at risk			0
invest wisely and enjoy significant returns history shows us that investing in today 's aid recipients will help convert them to tomorrow 's consumers of @entity17 exports			1
eleven of the 15 largest importers of @entity17 goods and services are former recipients of @entity17 foreign aid -- including @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			1
in today 's increasingly global economy , experts agree that the @entity17 will not recover from the @entity119 on its own			2
the @entity17 @entity120 estimates that for every $ 1 billion in goods the @entity17 exports , 6,000 manufacturing jobs are supported here at home			1
and 95 % of the world 's consumers live outside the @entity17			1
research released in october by the @entity128 shows that @entity75 's income is expected to triple in the next 50 years , and that most @entity132 countries " will attain upper middle income status " by then			0
all these individuals are potential consumers of @entity17 goods			2
always hunt for bargains for necessary items and services , bargain hunting pays off			0
foreign aid 's real price tag is a bargain compared with what it 's worth to taxpayers			1
year after year , polling shows that @entity17 are willing to spend 10 times what the government now allocates to foreign aid			1
the majority think humanitarian aid and development programs eat up 25 % of the federal budget , and then settle on 10 % as an appropriate amount			1
and yet the real amount is less than 1 % -- a bargain			2
five former secretaries of state -- from @entity160 to @entity161 -- last week expressed their support for funding the international affairs budget not only as " strategic investments in our nation 's security and prosperity , " but also to " demonstrate @entity17 's proud tradition of goodwill and global leadership			2
" @entity17 have always shown tremendous generosity even in tough economic times			1
more @entity17 donated to @entity175 earthquake relief efforts than watched the @entity176 last year			0
giving @entity17 reports that giving by individuals is on the rise -- up 2.7 % in 2010 over the previous year			2
and the biggest percentage increase in donations went to charities involved in international affairs : a 15 % increase			0
no presidential candidate wants to be out of touch with voters			0
i urge @entity6 candidates to frame their position on foreign aid based on what @entity17 want : to safeguard their wallets and show compassion for people suffering overseas			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

@entity6 presidential hopefuls are targeting foreign aid , says @entity197
foreign assistance comprises less than 1 % of the federal budget , he says
countries we aid now may be tomorrow 's consumers of @entity17 exports , he says
@entity197 : @entity17 have always shown generosity , even in tough economic times
