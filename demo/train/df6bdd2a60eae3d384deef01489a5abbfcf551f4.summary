@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 will head to the polls sunday in a tight race that centers on how to best manage @entity1 's robust economic growth			1
@entity1 can expect growth of 7 % this year , according to the @entity7 , and is one of the fastest - growing economies in @entity10			1
the country overcame the global financial crisis relatively unharmed , maintaining gdp growth , employment creation and poverty reduction , according @entity1 's ministry of economics and finance			1
the good news comes with high expectations from @entity1 , who want to see the rewards of this progress in tangible ways in their lives			1
while the economy as a whole has done well , salaries have remained depressed during the same period			1
so the big question for @entity1 this sunday is , who will make the most of the recent combination of good macroeconomic management and high commodity prices ? they have five main choices who are so close in the polls that pollsters anticipate there will be a second round of voting			1
but it is impossible to predict which two candidates will make it to the second round			1
@entity1 law forbids the publishing of poll numbers one week prior to election day , but the trend from all pollsters previously was a rise for @entity54 , who entered the final stretch as the leader of the pack			1
the nationalist @entity54 represents the most radical departure from the rest of the pack			0
the former army officer , who participated in a failed uprising in 2000 , lost to current president @entity63 in the second round of the last presidential elections			2
his previous presidential bid was sunk in part because of accusations that he admired and would emulate @entity71 president @entity70 , who embarked on a socialist reorganization of his country			2
@entity54 denies that he would follow in @entity70 's footsteps , and has portrayed himself as an admirer of former @entity77 president @entity76 , who represented a more center - left position			2
" i think ( @entity54 ) has tried much harder to appear more moderate , more centered , " analyst @entity79 said			0
running close to him is @entity81 , the daughter of disgraced former president @entity82			2
at 36 , she is the youngest of the candidates			2
at 19 , she was the country 's first lady for her father			0
" she is young , which is both a positive and negative characteristic , " @entity79 said			0
" it puts her close to a very important segment of voters , but it detracts from her experience			0
" critics have accused her of campaigning more to free her father , who is serving multiple , concurrent 25 - year sentences , but she says that his case should rest on decisions from the judiciary , not the executive			0
another former president , @entity98 , also has the potential to advance to the second round			2
@entity101 , who was the face of the opposition to @entity81 , championed market - oriented policies that helped @entity1 grow during his term from 2001 to 2006 , but was unpopular in the polls			1
he is enjoying a resurgence of popularity that he is riding into this weekend 's elections			0
@entity112 is another surging candidate			0
the economist is a one - time minister of energy and mines , minister of economy , and prime minister			0
in addition to his @entity1 citizenship he holds an @entity120 one , which has been the source of criticism			1
but @entity112 has embraced his @entity1 nationality on the campaign trail , even adopting the cuy , a @entity1 guinea pig served as a traditional dish , as his mascot			1
the final leading candidate is @entity130 , a former mayor of @entity0			0
" he is an efficient and successful public administrator that has done works for the good of the community , and @entity0 has recognized that with a very high approval rating , " analyst @entity135 said			0
" but in the campaign , he was unable to turn it into a national symbol			0
" the top two vote - getters would face each other in a runoff on june 5			1
journalist @entity143 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 will vote for a new president on sunday
