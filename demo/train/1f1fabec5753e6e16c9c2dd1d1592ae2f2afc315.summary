-- a new version of @entity2 , the company 's breakthrough entry into the world of wearable tech , is on the way			1
current testers , or " explorers , " in @entity10 's parlance , will get a chance to swap out their current models for the new ones , the company said in a @entity16 post			0
the new @entity2 hardware will work with eyeglasses or shades , and include an ear bud to replace the speaker in the current model			1
the bone - conduction speaker , which , similar to some hearing aids , literally sends sound waves through the skull to the ear , has been called faulty by some testers			1
the swap begins friday and testers will have 60 days to decide if they want new glass			0
the roughly 10,000 current testers also be able to invite up to three friends into the program , which requires testers to fork over the current $ 1,500 price of the glasses			1
" over the next few weeks , all explorers will have the opportunity to invite three friends to join the program , " the post said			1
" they 'll be able to buy @entity2 online and can have it shipped to their home , office , treehouse or igloo			1
we 're counting on you to get @entity2 to the people you think will make great explorers			2
" @entity10 has not said when @entity2 will go on sale to the general public , though it is expected to be some time next year			2
@entity2 , worn like regular glasses , has a high - resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access features like e-mail , text messaging , @entity63 , @entity10 search and a handful of other apps			2
it 's not clear what hardware changes will be made to make the new glass work better with other eyeglasses , though some in the tech press were speculating that users will be able to insert prescription lenses into it			2
it 's possible to wear both @entity2 and eyeglasses currently , though many users who have tried have called it awkward			1
the post did n't say how the overall design of @entity2 will be tweaked in the next version			0
looking a little bit like something out of an ' 80s sci - fi movie , some have said the device looks ... well ... goofy , at least on the sometimes geekish early adopters who have been sporting them			0
@entity2 has been a groundbreaker in wearable tech , a movement that 's shaping up to be the coming wave in the technology world			0
@entity93 has weighed in with @entity94 , a smartwatch that works with its @entity96 smartphones			0
@entity10 and @entity97 are believed to be joining the smartwatch market soon , and @entity99 and @entity100 are just a couple of the other names that have wristwatch tech for sale			0
read more than a watch : @entity97 's entry into wearable tech			0
