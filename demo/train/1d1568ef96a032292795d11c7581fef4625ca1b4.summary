-- @entity1 might just be @entity3 's best - kept sporting secret			1
little - known outside the tribes of the @entity6 in the northwest , it 's a " magical " mix of horse racing , track - and - field relay and the all - action adrenalin of rodeo			1
each race is battled out by up to six jockeys over three laps of a track -- and the riders have to change horses every lap. with handlers for each horse , it creates a melee of 18 horses and 24 people			1
it is pure , unadulterated and unpredictable chaos			0
to add a further twist , they do n't use saddles or helmets , and the danger element adds to the " rock star " esteem in which the jockeys are held by their communities			1
@entity36 has been involved in the sport for 37 years -- first as a rider back in 1978 and now as a team owner after returning after 21 years away , following a five - year stint in the @entity41			1
" i do n't know how to sell the sport but what i do know is that it 's a fast - paced , high - action sport , " he explains			1
" the adrenalin rush is the biggest buzz you can imagine			0
" you ca n't beat that feeling , there 's nothing like it			1
it 's better than any high that you can experience , if you 'd done anything like that			1
for me , it 's @entity3 's best - kept secret as a sport			1
" horses are a way of life for the @entity61 tribes of @entity62 , where @entity63 is based			1
" i 've been around horses from the day i hit the ground , " he says			0
they take away the everyday stresses of life			0
" i was away from @entity72 relay for 21 years but i was never away from horses			1
they 're a part of me			0
" the @entity76 is a @entity61 territory in @entity62			0
tribal elder @entity77 admits @entity72 relay is little known nationwide but describes the sport as " magical			1
" " it 's the spirit of the animals and the spirit of the people coming together			1
but what amazes me is the effect it has on the spectators as well , " explains @entity83 , whose son used to race and whose grandson is now entering the sport as a rider			1
" you see the faces of the families watching and it 's understandable how excited they are supporting their family members or their teams			2
but you look across the crowds at races and everyone 's just so involved			2
it 's a magical sport			1
" @entity83 has helped it gain slightly wider acclaim after being introduced to @entity3 filmmaker @entity104 , who last year released a documentary called " @entity1			1
" it takes an in - depth look at the sport and the characters within it , including @entity83 and @entity36			1
the project was a labor of love for @entity104 , who spent the first of the four years it took to complete trying to gain the trust of the communities -- no mean feat when there is a mistrust of outsiders			2
but gradually @entity104 managed to get a true insight into the lives of those who eat , sleep and breathe the sport , in communities which are often very poor and where adult unemployment can be as high as 80 %			1
" some of these are super-duper poor communities and in some cases without @entity72 relay some of the young kids would fall into trouble , " he says			2
@entity104 had some prior knowledge of @entity1 but admits his project became less about the sport and more about the people , the tribes and the communities it touches			1
" you feel like you 're falling off the edge of the world , " says @entity104 , who followed teams from the @entity139 in @entity140 and the @entity141 and @entity142			0
" you 're in the wild west with no real connection to the rest of the world			0
my film was not so much about horse racing , i guess , as the rural west			0
" however , the film does capture the madness of the racing and the horse exchanges -- which occur with rider and animal moving at full pelt			0
" these are top horses often at the ends of their career , " @entity104 explains			0
" so they 're obviously going at some speed			0
" there 's dangers but not as many people get hurt as you might think			2
i think the whole time i was there i saw one hospitalization and the guy was fine in the end			0
" @entity63 admits that " nobody went into this sport and did n't get hurt " but points out the injuries are relatively low because of the expertise of those involved			2
" you need to have an incredibly high level of horsemanship both by the riders and those on the ground , " he says			1
" we do n't wear helmets and saddles as we 're considered some of the best horse people on the face of the earth			1
" if we wore those , we 'd be a laughing stock			0
that 's our pride and we take great pride in it			2
" @entity1 is immersed in the middle of its season , with races virtually every weekend			1
prize money is on offer but the amounts are relatively small , particularly given how far funds have to stretch among the team setup			0
but @entity63 says it is not about the money : " it 's about the pride , about the bragging rights when you win over the other tribes			1
" @entity83 echoes the overriding element of pride , but admits that watching her family members race at breakneck speed can be a harsh experience			2
her faith in their horse - handling , however , makes it easier viewing			2
" it is nerve wracking , " she says			0
" i remember seeing my son @entity228 ride for the first time			0
he really wanted to ride but had to wait to get picked			0
i was in the stands and suddenly my friend was like , ' that 's your son racing			2
' " i thought no - one would pick him and so it was like , ' @entity234			2
' so from there it 's no turning back , i ca n't stop him			2
horses have always been in my family -- it 's part of my life , an extension of me			0
" and it 's so good			0
i remember how hard my son worked feeding , exercising the horses , doing everything that was required			0
it 's a special thing			0
" riders like @entity255 are " treated like rock stars , " says @entity104 , but only to a local audience			0
" the funny thing is that in the next - door town some people wo n't have even heard of it , " he adds			0
it truly is @entity3 's best - kept sporting secret .			1

@entity1 is a fast - paced , high action sport *reserved* to the @entity263
little - known outside the tribes , it is *arguably* @entity3 's best kept sporting secret
riders race without saddles and helmets in a *frenetic* relay involving man and beast
the sport is beginning to gain greater acclaim , with a documentary made about it
