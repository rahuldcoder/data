-- the hottest music venue in @entity2 opened its doors on thursday morning to a select group in the @entity5			1
@entity6 , which makes @entity8 music - streaming software , launched the much - hyped @entity5 version of its service after delays and years of negotiation			1
at first , @entity6 will only accept new members to its free service who receive invitations from the company , one of its sponsors or a current user			1
" this is the biggest market in the world , " @entity21 , @entity6 's content chief , said in an interview late wednesday			1
" we have n't done a launch this large			0
" @entity27 , the new social network , also launched recently using an invite - only scheme			0
@entity6 plans to welcome everyone for free after " several weeks , " @entity21 said			2
the @entity6 computer program will let people choose from any of 15 million songs to hear for free -- up to 10 hours per month , with each track listenable up to five times			0
for the first six months , however , people who enter during the invitation period are exempt from the monthly limit , @entity21 said			0
after that , users can lift the restrictions by paying $ 5 a month or buying songs individually , like @entity42			0
the smartphone apps can be accessed for $ 10 a month , which includes unlimited streaming and the ability to save copy - protected music for listening offline			1
the ability to create and share playlists with @entity51 friends has formed a beehive mix - tape culture among the more than 10 million users in @entity2			2
from a small office in @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity6 quickly spread its tentacles across @entity2			1
but during the past couple of years , the company has been caught in a web of bureaucracy			0
record - label executives have expressed concern that @entity6 's free offering devalues music and does n't drum up significant revenue			1
" they wanted to be careful , " @entity21 said			0
" @entity6 has always had a view that the free experience was core to what @entity6 was all about and key to get users to invest in the service			2
" @entity6 ceo @entity75 echoed that belief at a technology conference in december , as he has in several public appearances before that and likely will again at @entity82 's @entity81 conference next week			2
" we really believe in our model , " @entity75 said at the @entity83 : dive into @entity86 conference last year			0
" we would not just launch a subscription model , because we do n't think that 's going to work			0
" now , the four major labels and @entity6 have finally settled their disputes			2
in the time since , the record companies have given the go - ahead to competing digital music initiatives such as @entity95 , @entity96 and , most recently , @entity98 's @entity97			1
" we think there 's definitely room and appetite for a service like @entity6 , " @entity21 said			1
" there really is nothing like it in the market			0
