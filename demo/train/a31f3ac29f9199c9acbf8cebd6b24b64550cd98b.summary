-- there are some sports figures who , no matter who else is playing , make you simply want to turn on the television to see what kind of excitement they will bring to the game			0
they make up some of the greatest to ever play their respective sports , and when they hit the field , court or ice , all eyes were on them			0
@entity25 quarterback @entity24 has n't remotely achieved their level of stardom , but when it comes to being mr. @entity31 in college football , man , this kid can flat electrify the crowd with his play and leave his opponents shaking their heads in frustration			1
i do n't care about @entity41 's offense or @entity43 's defense or how @entity44 has revived @entity46 's football program			1
there is no doubt that @entity24 has taken the college football world by storm , and maybe by the end of the season , he could be the first freshman ever to win the @entity53			1
yes , the kid is just that good			0
when @entity25 made the decision to leave the @entity56 to play in the @entity57 , fans and the media alike forecasted a tough few years for the @entity60			2
everyone said , " welcome to big boy football , " citing the recent national champions that have hailed from the conference			0
the critics said the noble men of @entity67 -- @entity25 's home stadium -- would be the doormat of the league , languishing at the bottom and following the path of @entity73 , who left the @entity60 in the @entity75 in 1991 for the @entity57 and disappeared into oblivion			1
see highlights from @entity25 's win over @entity43 all of that changed last saturday when the @entity60 went to @entity80 , @entity43 , for the first time and knocked off the defending national champions and the no. 1 - ranked team in the country , the @entity85			1
the one play that will be remembered was the touchdown where @entity24 stepped up in the pocket , ran into one of his own players , the ball popped up in the air , he caught it , rolled left and found @entity95 in the back of the end zone			1
he is a fearless kid			0
slide after a big run ? nope			0
@entity24 wants to take the head off a linebacker or a safety by slamming into them			2
he 's not built like a @entity104 truck in the mold of @entity106			0
but after the hit , he pops up and runs around the field like an 8 - year - old ready for the next play			0
the mania around @entity24 has taken on epic proportions			2
and it 's only going to get bigger , which says a lot in @entity115 , where football has long been like a religion			2
@entity24 's emergence is excellent for the ninth - ranked @entity60 and first - year coach @entity119			1
for decades , @entity25 has played in the shadows of its archrival , the @entity121			2
while @entity25 has enjoyed some successful teams in the last two decades , the @entity121 have long been a national power			0
the success of the @entity60 with @entity24 will no doubt help recruiting			0
and if the runaway candidate to be the mvp of the @entity57 continues to meet the @entity53 hype , the legend of @entity24 will only grow			1
that 's good for my alma mater , @entity25 ; good for the @entity57 ; and good the casual fan who desires a mythical figure to root for .			1

@entity134 : @entity25 *qb* @entity24 has taken the college football world by storm
by season 's end , @entity24 may be the first freshman ever to win the @entity53
