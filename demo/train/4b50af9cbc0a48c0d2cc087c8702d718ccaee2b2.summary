the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of @entity2 , and the true identities of some of its passengers , are as deep as the southeast @entity8 waters where multinational search teams are searching for the jet			2
navies from two of @entity14 's neighbors were pursuing new leads as sunday turned into monday in the region			1
@entity18 's navy has spotted a floating object about 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) southwest of @entity18 's @entity20 , which is off the country 's southwest coast in the @entity22 , @entity25 spokesman @entity23 told @entity26			1
the object was spotted by a @entity18 navy rescue aircraft at about 7:30 a.m. et sunday ( 6:30 p.m. local time )			1
because of the dark , the navy aircraft could not get close enough to identify the floating object and was recalled to base			2
three search and rescue boats have since been deployed to that location			2
meanwhile , @entity38 's navy is shifting its focus in the search away from the @entity22 of @entity38 and the @entity41 , @entity36 rear adm. karn dee - ubon told @entity26 on sunday			1
the shift came at the request of the @entity14 , who are looking into possibilities the plane turned around and could have gone down in the @entity48 , near @entity38 's border , @entity42 said			1
the @entity48 lies to the west of a narrow strip of @entity38 that ends in the @entity52 , while the @entity22 of @entity38 lies to the east of that @entity38 isthmus			1
one promising lead has turned out to be a dead end			2
a " strange object " spotted by a @entity64 search plane late sunday afternoon is not debris from the missing jetliner , a @entity58 official familiar with the issue told @entity26 on sunday			1
a @entity58 reconnaissance plane " thought it saw something like debris , but it was a false alarm , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity			1
by the end of the day sunday , more than 40 planes and more than two dozen ships from several countries were involved in the search			2
two reconnaissance aircraft from @entity78 and one plane and five sea vessels from @entity81 were the latest additions , @entity83 , the director general of civil aviation in @entity14 , told reporters sunday			2
in addition , the @entity87 navy dispatched a frigate and an amphibious landing ship , according to an online post by @entity87 's navy			1
those reinforcements join the rescue teams already scouring the @entity41 , near the @entity22 , for any sign of where the flight , operated by @entity14 's flagship airline , might have gone down , @entity52 authorities said			2
the area in focus for most of the search , about 90 miles south of @entity20 , is where a @entity18 plane reportedly spotted oil slicks that stretched between 6 and 9 miles			1
" i can confirm that there was an oil slick , no debris			2
but what we are doing now , i was told that the @entity18 aircrafts are on the site right now to verify what actually is it on the surface of those waters , " said acting @entity52 transportation minister @entity110			1
big questions far outweigh the few fragments of information that have emerged about the plane 's disappearance : what happened to the plane ? why was no distress signal issued ? who exactly was aboard ? the flight may have changed course and turned back toward @entity131 , @entity52 military officials said at a news conference sunday			1
but the pilot appears to have given no signal to authorities that he was turning around , the officials said , attributing the change of course to indications from radar data			1
as the search continues , the agonizing wait goes on for relatives of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board the plane			1
video from @entity148 showed @entity150 personnel in @entity151 , where @entity2 was headed , helping family members apply for expedited passports so they could fly to @entity131 early this week			1
among the passengers , 154 people were from @entity87 or @entity156 ; 38 @entity14 , five @entity158 nationals and three @entity58 citizens			0
five of the passengers were younger than 5 years old			0
@entity150 said monday that initial financial assistance has been given out to all passengers ' families " over and above their basic needs			1
" each family has also been assigned at least one caregiver			0
" @entity150 ' primary focus at this point in time is to care for the families			1
this means providing them with timely information , travel facilities , accommodation , meals , medical and emotional support , " the airline said in a statement			0
stolen passports @entity183 tweeted sunday that it is " examining additional suspect # passports in connection " with the missing flight			1
earlier , the international law enforcement agency said at least two passports -- one @entity189 and one @entity190 -- recorded in its stolen and lost travel documents database were used by passengers onboard the flight			2
the passports were added to the database after being stolen in separate incidents over the past two years , @entity183 said			1
@entity190 and @entity189 have said that none of their citizens were onboard the plane			2
" no checks of the stolen @entity189 and @entity190 passports were made by any country between the time they were entered into @entity183 's database and the departure of flight mh 370			1
at this time , @entity183 is therefore unable to determine on how many other occasions these passports were used to board flights or cross borders , " the agency said in a sunday statement			1
it added that passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times last year without having their passports screened by @entity183 's databases			1
the @entity190 man whose passport was allegedly used , @entity222 , contacted the @entity190 consulate in @entity225 , @entity38 , on saturday , after receiving a call from his parents , @entity190 consul @entity221 told @entity26 on sunday			1
@entity222 told @entity148 he was inundated with phone calls , texts and social media inquiries asking if he was alive and well			0
he soon discovered that he was the subject of stories about the missing plane			1
@entity222 is staying on @entity225 as a tourist , and his passport disappeared in july 2013 , @entity221 said			0
@entity222 told @entity148 he got a new passport after his old one was stolen			0
" whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane , it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in @entity183 's databases , " said @entity183 secretary general @entity238 in a statement			1
the two passengers who used the passports in question appear to have bought their tickets together			2
the tickets were bought from @entity255 at identical prices , paid in @entity38 's baht currency , according to @entity87 's official e-ticket verification system @entity259			1
the ticket numbers are contiguous , which indicates the tickets were issued together			0
the two tickets booked with @entity255 both start in @entity131 , fly to @entity151 , and then onward to @entity264			0
the @entity190 passport 's ticket continues to @entity267 , the @entity189 's to @entity269			2
authorities say they are investigating the identities of some of those onboard who appear to have issues with their passports			2
" i 've seen these reports about the passports			2
we 're looking into that , but we do n't have anything to confirm at this point , " @entity58 deputy national security adviser @entity280 told @entity26 's " @entity285 " on sunday			2
" the reports certainly raise questions and concerns , and that 's exactly why we 're looking into them			2
but right now , it would be premature to speculate , " he said			0
plane was ' at safest point ' in flight terrorism concerns a fuller picture of what happened may not become available until searchers find the plane and its flight data recorder			1
" we have not been able to locate anything , see anything , " @entity83 told reporters sunday			0
the passport mystery raised concerns about the possibility of terrorism , but officials cautioned that it was still too early to arrive at any conclusions			0
@entity52 authorities have been in contact with counterterrorism organizations about possible passport issues , acting transportation minister @entity315 said sunday			0
he did n't specify how many potential passport issues there were , saying authorities are looking at the whole passenger manifest			0
additionally , no inquiry was made by @entity150 to determine if any passengers on the flight were traveling on stolen passports , he said			1
many airlines do not check the database , he said			0
five passengers ended up not boarding the aircraft			0
their bags were removed and were not onboard the jet when it disappeared , @entity110 said			0
a @entity58 intelligence official said that no link to terrorism had been discovered so far , but that authorities were still investigating			0
another possible explanation for the use of the stolen passports is illegal immigration			0
there are previous cases of illegal immigrants using fake passports to try to enter @entity342 countries			0
and @entity343 is known to be a booming market for stolen passports			0
disappearing during cruise there is a precedent for a modern jetliner to fall from the sky while " in the cruise " and lie hidden for months , according to @entity26 aviation correspondent @entity351			0
on june 1 , 2009 , @entity353 was en route from @entity355 to @entity356 when communications ended suddenly from the @entity358 , another state - of - the - art aircraft			0
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447 's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean			0
it took even longer to find the cause of the disaster			0
in may 2011 , the aircraft 's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles			1
it was not until july 2012 that investigators published their report , which blamed the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems			0
the missing @entity150 plane had suffered damage in the past , airline ceo @entity388 said sunday			1
the aircraft had a clipped wing tip , but @entity393 repaired it , and the jet was safe to fly , @entity388 said			0
the @entity396 announced late saturday that a team of its investigators was en route to @entity343 to help with the investigation , the agency said			0
if all those on board @entity2 are found to have died , it will rank as the deadliest airline disaster since november 12 , 2001 , when @entity405 crashed into a @entity407 neighborhood , killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground			0
the deadliest commercial air crash ever involving a single plane occurred almost 30 years ago on august 12 , 1985 , in the mountains of central @entity414			0
a total of 520 people were killed when @entity417 -- a @entity418 -- crashed not long after takeoff from @entity420			0

@entity150 says financial assistance has been given to families
@entity183 tweets it 's " examining additional suspect # passports "
