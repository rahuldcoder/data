-- in a development that should surprise absolutely no one , @entity2 activists were quick friday to say that president @entity6 's efforts to limit the agency 's spying activities did n't go far enough			1
leading up to a speech in which he outlined reforms that include requiring court approval for analysts to dig into telephone data , @entity6 had promised to address privacy concerns while defending digital surveillance in the name of national security			1
advocates who feel that the @entity20 's techniques , some of which have been exposed by former contractor turned international fugitive @entity23 , represent a massive intrusion into citizen privacy responded quickly and often harshly			1
some examples : @entity27 and @entity28 , policy experts at @entity30 ( makers of web browser @entity32 ) " we 'd hoped for , and the @entity33 deserves , more			0
without a meaningful change of course , the @entity33 will continue on its path toward a world of balkanization and distrust , a grave departure from its origins of openness and opportunity			0
" @entity44 and @entity45 , co-founders of the @entity47 " rather than dismantling the @entity20 's unconstitutional mass surveillance programs , or even substantially restraining them , president @entity6 today has issued his endorsement of them			1
... the speech today was ' historic ' in the worst sense			2
it represents a historic failure by a president to rein in mass government illegality and violations of fundamental rights			0
" @entity60 ( via @entity61 ) " today , @entity6 took several steps toward reforming @entity20 surveillance , but there 's a long way to go			1
now it 's up @entity67 & courts			2
" ( the foundation gave @entity6 3.5 points out of 12 on a scorecard it had created on its hopes for " real @entity20 reform			1
" @entity74 , executive director , @entity75 " the president 's speech outlined several developments which we welcome			1
increased transparency for the @entity81 , improved checks and balances at the @entity85 court through the creation of a panel of advocates , and increased privacy protections for non- @entity91 citizens abroad -- the first such assertion by a @entity91 president -- are all necessary and welcome reforms			2
" however , the president 's decision not to end bulk collection and retention of all @entity91 ' data remains highly troubling			0
the president outlined a process to study the issue further and appears open to alternatives			0
but the president should end -- not mend -- the government 's collection and retention of all law - abiding @entity91 ' data			0
" @entity108 , @entity109 founder " i think it 's embarrassing for a head of state like that to go on for almost 45 minutes and say almost nothing			1
... it 's clear that the president would not be speaking today without the actions of @entity23 and whiste - blowers before him			0
... security whistleb - lowers have forced this debate			0
this president has been dragged , kicking and screaming , to today 's address			0
he 's been very reluctant to make any concrete reforms , and unfortunately , today we also see very few concrete reforms			2

activists say @entity6 's @entity20 speech was not enough
@entity6 *announced* reforms while defending surveillance
@entity108 says the speech was " embarrassing "
