-- @entity1 was killed exactly one week after president @entity2 returned to @entity3 at the end of a long period of medical treatment in @entity7			1
intelligence analysts say that may have been no coincidence , and that with @entity1 's killing , @entity2 is underlining to the @entity12 -- and the @entity7 -- that they still need him			1
@entity2 's return was something of a surprise both to @entity3 and the international community			1
he had been seen as the main stumbling block to political dialogue and a transition to fresh elections sponsored by the @entity21			0
but several analysts consulted by @entity0 said the @entity7 were concerned that the growing unrest in @entity3 could morph into outright civil war -- in a country that shares a long and porous desert border with the kingdom			1
the rationale in @entity29 , according to these analysts , was that only @entity2 had the guile and stature to pull his country back from the brink , despite his injuries and his array of enemies			1
and at the same time , @entity2 would be best placed to turn up the heat on @entity38 , now established in at least two eastern provinces and in parts of southern @entity3			1
diplomatic sources in the @entity42 say that far from being surprised by @entity2 's return , the @entity7 authorities sanctioned and assisted in it , providing a jet that flew him to the southern city of @entity47 in the early hours of friday last week			1
they say @entity2 did not fly directly to @entity48 , the capital , because the airport and the route into the city are not reliably under government control			1
in fact , the capital is now a patchwork of pro- and @entity56 enclaves			0
a helicopter was waiting at the @entity47 airport to fly @entity59 miles to the presidential palace in @entity48 before dawn			0
again , arriving by air was probably preferable to negotiating the chaotic streets of the capital			0
@entity65 - born radical cleric understood the @entity12 there has been no official comment from @entity7 on how @entity2 returned home from @entity29 , but sources in @entity48 and elsewhere in the @entity42 say the @entity7 wanted @entity2 back in @entity3 because they were increasingly anxious about the growing political influence of militant islamists in @entity3 seen as sympathetic to @entity38			1
they point out that @entity2 met with @entity7 @entity72 a few days before he returned			1
the kingdom has long been concerned by the growth of @entity38 in @entity3 , even though the number of militants may not exceed several hundred			1
several prominent @entity7 jihadists have joined the leadership of @entity80 , which for a while in recent months took control of most of the city of @entity85 in southern @entity3			2
it was also from @entity3 in august 2009 that @entity38 sent a suicide bomber -- 23 - year - old @entity87 -- to carry out an assassination attempt on @entity90 s intelligence chief , prince @entity89 , in august 2009			1
analysts say that to the @entity7 , and indeed to @entity94 , any commitment by @entity2 to chase down @entity38 's leadership in @entity3 would be welcome indeed			1
and , they say , @entity2 probably perceives a grand bargain himself : cooperate in tracking down @entity1 and other @entity80 seniors in return for less pressure to leave office			2
@entity65 drone killed @entity65 cleric in @entity3 , officials say just hours before @entity1 's death , @entity2 hinted at his own unique role in " saving " @entity3 from @entity38 , and broader coordination with allies , in an interview with the @entity109 and @entity108			1
" we are fighting the @entity38 organization in [ the southern region of ] @entity115 in coordination with the @entity65 and @entity7 , " he said in an interview at the presidential palace			2
" at the same time , @entity65 intelligence has knowledge that ( @entity38 ) is in contact with both the @entity120 ( the opposition @entity121 ) and the military officers who are outlaws			2
and they ( the @entity120 and officers ) told the vice president , " give us @entity115 , and we will stop the war in @entity115 and the @entity38 network there			1
" in other words : ' all my opponents are in league with @entity38			2
' @entity132 : who was he ? opposition figures in @entity3 say it 's unlikely that @entity2 returned home , despite terrible burns and a chaotic situation , just to hand over the keys to the presidential palace			1
and certainly , since his return , @entity2 has given little indication that he plans to go quietly			2
in the @entity108 and @entity109 interview , he launched a broadside against tribal leaders and dissident generals opposed to him			0
" the @entity21 initiative is clear			0
it says to remove all the elements causing tensions , " he said			0
" because if we transfer power and they are there , this will mean that we have given in to a coup			0
if we transfer power , and they are in their positions , and they are still decision - makers , this will be very dangerous			0
this will lead to civil war			0
" former @entity165 spy : @entity132 " very narcissistic " @entity166 , an expert on @entity3 with the @entity167 , says @entity2 is the one political institution who is above everyone else in @entity3			1
he can adjudicate a dispute or solve a problem			0
" in my mind it is no coincidence this happened after his return , " @entity166 says			0
@entity166 adds that the dynamic inside @entity3 has changed			2
previously the government was reluctant to move against @entity1 because of fears about a hostile domestic reaction -- and the influence of his family and clan			0
that has changed : intelligence co-operation has improved and the killing of @entity1 is a way for @entity2 to demonstrate that the @entity65 still needs him			2
@entity2 , now in power for more than forty years and regarded as one of the wiliest politicians in the @entity194 world , is well aware of the dynamic			2
" what we see is that we are pressurized by @entity65 and the international community to speed up the process of handing over power , " he told @entity108 and the @entity109			0
" and we know to where the power is going to go			0
it is going to @entity38 , which is directly and completely linked to the @entity120			0
" the shorthand : " @entity205 , la deluge			0
" but there is also a @entity3 saying which translates roughly as " from a pound of talk , an ounce of understanding			0
" suitable guidance in any exploration of president @entity2 's motives and intentions			1
