it 's a story that could have borrowed some of its plot from a @entity6 movie , but audiences might have scoffed at the improbable ending @entity8 achieved in real life			1
a script containing some classic storytelling themes -- poor rural upbringing , family tragedy , arranged marriages and political ambitions -- was afforded its defining element when @entity8 put in an historic performance at the @entity18 held in 2010			1
in the entire 80 - year history of the quadrennial sporting jamboree , no @entity20 female had ever claimed gold in a track and field event until @entity8 snatched a momentous victory in the women 's discus			1
her winning throw of 61.51 meters led an @entity20 clean sweep in the event ( compatriots @entity32 and @entity33 took silver and bronze respectively ) and also ensured @entity20 's first win in the athletics stadium since the runner @entity38 , known as " the @entity38 , " dashed to gold in the men 's 440 yards at the @entity18 held in @entity40 , @entity42 way back in 1958			1
" i can never forget that moment when i won the gold medal and when i took the victory lap with the flag , " @entity8 told @entity1 's @entity46 series			1
" for four years i was seeing the moment in my dreams and now i was finally seeing it in reality , " she added wiping away tears from her eyes			0
@entity8 could be forgiven for welling up given her journey from provincial backwater to a packed stadium in @entity59			1
born in the small town of @entity61 in the state of @entity63 , @entity8 was brought up in by her father and grandmother after her mother died when she was just nine years old			2
living among the @entity69 people -- a traditional agricultural community in northern @entity20 -- @entity8 recalls a childhood where physical fitness was honed working the land not at play on a sports field			1
" most people are agriculturalist and their routine is to get up early and feed the livestock and after breakfast they leave for the fields , " she explains			0
" my family had a milk dairy and we had around 70 - 80 buffalo			2
the work of the milking was only done by the family ... and when i was ( 15 - 16 years old ) i would help , milking seven to eight buffaloes in one go			2
" @entity90 afforded something of a respite from this routine as well as providing an outlet for her growing interest in sport which was exercised further as she continued her formal education			2
" when i got to college i used to compete with the other girls			0
my height and strength was good -- i could throw well , " she explains			0
it was during this time that she got married , but rather than strangling her sporting ambitions , wedlock set them free			0
" in our community we mostly have arranged marriages , but by the grace of god or luck my husband was a sportsman , " she said			0
@entity116 had been a promising junior hammer thrower who had won medals at @entity120 before injury forced him into early retirement			2
but when he married @entity8 his sporting energies were revitalized as he applied himself to the role of husband and coach			2
" after getting married to @entity116 , i got to learn a lot -- he knew about the @entity129 , the @entity130 and knew what it meant to win medals ... " she said			2
" when he told me about it i thought that i should be a part of it as well			0
" with his knowledge and his unflinching support -- " he had 100 % belief in me , " she says -- @entity8 set about trying to achieve her newly - discovered sporting goals			1
there were setbacks along the way -- a back injury in 2000 almost finished her career and the birth of a son the following year meant she had to juggle parental responsibilities alongside training - but her commitment paid off in the long run			2
bronze medals at the 2006 and 2010 @entity129 preceded her historic gold medal performance at the @entity18			1
more records were broken two years later at the @entity130 when @entity8 became the first @entity20 woman ever to reach the @entity156 discus final , eventually finishing a creditable sixth			1
the 32 - year - old has since used her sporting fame to good effect away from the discus circle helping the @entity164 state @entity162 in their campaigns to curb the ongoing curse of female foeticide			1
the selective abortion of female fetuses is a continuing problem in @entity20 , and is particularly prevalent in @entity63 where @entity8 grew up , according to @entity171			1
she has also been actively involved in trying to improve sporting facilities for children in @entity175 , where she lives with husband and their 13 - year - old son , and across the country			1
" if you see the schools we have in @entity20 there is no ground or fields for the kids to play in			2
physical ( education ) is n't given much importance			0
it is said that childhood grows as you play and that 's how sport starts , " she says			0
" i came from a village			0
if i can reach ( the top ) level then why ca n't other girls from villages do that , " she says			0
@entity8 's attentions have switched to politics in recent years , joining the center - left @entity203 -- headed by @entity205 -- in 2013 and it looks like the final chapters of her sporting script may be being penned now , although she 's keen to compete at the @entity210 next year			1
but the narrative that seeks to re-write traditional attitudes towards women in wider @entity20 society is only just beginning			1
" for a very long time , the culture of our country has been a very male dominating one and the male child has been given a lot of importance , " she says			0
" until the time we are not able to abolish the discrimination of a boy and a girl within the family this thing will continue -- ( a child 's ) thinking develops from this situation			0
" @entity8 also advocates that dowries -- which are officially banned in @entity20 , though gifts to grooms and his family are still common -- should be put towards a girl 's education so " she is able to stand on her own two feet , " she says			1
" they say the first teacher is the mother			0
if she is educated she will give good virtues to her children she can change the atmosphere of her house			0
the base of our society starts from there			0
" few would argue with that assertion .			0

@entity8 became first @entity20 woman to win @entity18 gold in track and field
@entity8 won the women 's discus final at 2010 games *hosted* by @entity59
the 32 - year - old now mixes sports career with political and *gender* **rights** campaigning
@entity263 is a strong advocate of woman 's **rights** to education and curbing " male - dominated " @entity20 society
