-- all indicators suggest @entity2 will unveil the @entity3 3 during the first week of march			1
that 's less than a month away , and sources at @entity6 say @entity2 is in " crunch mode , " working hard to line up apps that show off the unique features of the next - gen tablet			0
the ipad 3 is expected to feature a high - definition , 2048 x 1536 " retina display			1
" if the new screen does appear in @entity2 's big reveal , it should provoke all the excitement of the company 's first retina display , which appeared in the @entity18 in 2010			1
according to a source who spoke with the @entity21 , the next @entity3 's screen will be " truly amazing			2
" so which apps might @entity2 use to show off the brilliance of its new display hardware ? we 've identified four key app categories that would be ideal for demo'ing the hd display			1
we 've also spoken to software developers about their @entity3 3 aspirations			2
none would spill any beans concerning launch - day involvement , but we did learn more about how the developer community is anticipating the new display			2
photography apps for shooting and viewing photographs would be ideal for showing off not only a high - resolution display , but also an improved camera , which is also a highly likely upgrade			1
@entity42 5 has a hidden panorama mode that developers have n't yet been able to take advantage of			0
so , if an @entity42 update accompanies the @entity3 3 launch , we might expect @entity2 to finally show off panorama mode in conjunction with an improved rear - facing camera			1
( the current ipad 2 camera is merely @entity54 caliber			0
) and if @entity2 does n't want to show off its own panorama capabilities , apps like @entity57 and 360 @entity58 would be great candidates to show off such a feature			0
@entity57 ceo @entity63 is so confident that @entity2 will be doubling the number of pixels in the height and width of its next tablet , his team is already preparing a new version of its app. " it 's four times as many pixels			0
that makes logical sense , and that 's what we 're anticipating			0
" as for viewing images , something like @entity79 would be a great app for @entity2 to showcase at the @entity3 demo			2
essentially a depository of mind - blowing photojournalism , @entity79 won the @entity86 award at 2011 ′ s @entity89 ( @entity88 's version of the @entity90 )			0
the app is broken down into various themed collections ( e.g. , dreams of @entity94 , @entity95 and , most recently , @entity96 ) , each full of stunning full - screen images			0
" we love @entity2 , we only build apps for @entity42 , " @entity79 senior vice president @entity98 told @entity0			0
" we basically will be ready with very high - quality , high - definition content as soon as a higher - resolution @entity3 comes out , " he said			1
@entity98 added it would only take a few weeks to tweak @entity79 for a retina display ipad			1
so , theoretically , if @entity2 asked the company to demo at the @entity3 3 launch , @entity79 would be ready			2
" but we havent gotten a phone call , " @entity98 says			0
@entity108 emphasized that the @entity3 is n't just a tool for consumption , like other mobile devices — it 's a tool for creation			2
@entity2 has its own photo - creation tools it can debut or update as well — photobooth for example			2
this app uses the @entity3 2 ′ s front - facing camera for taking self portraits with different visual effects , and it could receive an hd update			1
nonetheless , to expand its current content - creation possibilities for tablets , @entity2 would need to introduce new products			0
most likely , we think , would be a new ipad 3 version of @entity125 for more professional - caliber photo editing on the go			0
running a display resolution of 2048 x 1536 — a higher resolution than that of the screen on the 15 - inch @entity132 — would allow photographers to dive quite deep into onscreen details			1
the display would also be terrific for sharing slideshows			0
video when the @entity3 2 launched , one of the major new apps @entity2 introduced was @entity141 for @entity3			1
@entity141 lets you cut and edit video clips , use @entity144 to stream content to an @entity146 , and play video directly on the @entity3 itself			1
if the @entity3 3 is getting a spiffy new hd display , and ( just as likely ) an improved camera capable of recording 1080p video — you know , to match the display — then an update to @entity141 seems not just likely but inevitable			1
like an @entity125 port for @entity3 , an update to @entity141 would help solidify the @entity3 as a tool for creative types who do n't want to be tethered to a desktop or keyboard - burdened notebook			1
other video - centric apps could focus on sports , like the @entity165 app that was singled out at the original @entity3 's announcement			1
( maybe we 'll see @entity165 at @entity168			0
) and with @entity2 's @entity144 feature , we could see @entity2 demoing 1080p streaming video from the @entity146 to the @entity3 3			1
bottom line : if the new @entity3 does have a retina display , you can bet that action - packed , high - quality video will be a key part of the presentation			1
games at the @entity179 launch , @entity2 showed off @entity180 , which featured souped - up graphics to take advantage of the phone 's @entity184 processor and 3.5 - inch retina display			1
the ipad 3 is very likely to sport either a dual - core or quad - core @entity189 processor			1
either way , @entity189 performance will trump that of the @entity3 2 ′ s @entity184 chip , and paired with a high - resolution display , an immersive , action - packed game like @entity180 would be just the title to show what the new tablet is capable of			1
now , it does n't look like we 'll be seeing an hd version of @entity180 at the @entity3 3 ′ s launch			2
@entity206 representative @entity205 told us that the @entity180 team " has n't been talking to @entity2 about their plans for the future			0
" so what are some other possibilities ? @entity215 's @entity214 hd is a graphics - intensive @entity3 game that integrates with @entity146 and @entity218			1
it originally came out in january 2011 and was updated in november			0
" @entity215 is always keen to anticipate and support innovative features enabled by @entity2 , " representative @entity219 told us			0
@entity214 2 hd already has detailed graphics that would look even better on a higher - resolution display , not to mention a tablet with improved processor performance			1
at the @entity3 's original launch in 2010 , ceo @entity108 focused on a @entity227 version of the game @entity228 , as well as other apps from @entity231			2
considering @entity2 and @entity231 have teamed up before , it would n't be surprising to see an @entity231 game onscreen in @entity234 in a month 's time			0
options could be anything from @entity238 , whose sharp , high - flying action would make for an impressive spectacle , to maybe the @entity3 version of @entity243			1
an @entity3 version of @entity245 would probably be a bit too much wishful thinking , but you never know			2
textbooks @entity2 just updated ibooks and @entity250 , as well as ways to purchase and create digital textbooks , in its education - related announcement in january			1
it would n't be shocking to see the company iterate on these products one more time to make them hd ready			0
display quality is currently an issue when reading textbooks on regular e-readers and current tablets			2
e-ink e-readers ca n't show off bold , color graphics ( or any color at all ) , and even the @entity3 2 does n't have the display resolution to show off some educational content in all its glory			2
so being able to view and interact with images and diagrams in incredible detail on the @entity3 would be an impressive addition to an already useful educational tool			0
suddenly , processes like the @entity274 would n't be so dry anymore , and you could actually attend your engineering lectures without lugging half a dozen different tomes in your backpack			0
obviously , all of the app picks we mention above are purely speculative			0
but we would be surprised if @entity2 does n't showcase some type of app for each of the categories we 've called out			0

the @entity3 is expected to feature a high - definition , 2048 x 1536 retina display
the new @entity3 is very likely to sport either a dual - core or quad - core @entity189 processor
if the @entity3 gets a new hd display , an update of @entity141 and digital textbooks seem inevitable
