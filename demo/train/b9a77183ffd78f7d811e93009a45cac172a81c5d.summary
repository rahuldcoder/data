-- since the disappearance of @entity3 , no aviation search has garnered more attention than the loss of @entity6			2
the disappearance has become the mystery of the century			2
it is baffling both to the public and to aviation experts alike , myself included			2
first , let 's not forget to find compassion for the families and friends of the passengers on board this flight			1
accident investigations are aimed at finding them an answer , at discovering the cause of such tragedies and at preventing them from ever happening again			2
rather than delve into the numerous sabotage / terrorist theories , i 'd like to focus on mechanical malfunction			1
considering all the facts , or the accepted assumption of facts , a malfunction that overwhelmed the crew may still be a viable explanation			2
this makes the most sense to me , as a 30 - year airline veteran			2
opinion : flight 370 '' s resting place is best clue piecing together all the current information as of march 24 , i 'll describe a chronological scenario			1
the scenario is pure speculation on my part , and i have included commentary at various points			2
the captain utilizes a pc - based flight simulator and deletes some files			1
so what ? my take : this is a hobby			2
the captain is passionate about flying			1
did he fly only the 777 in the simulator ? he could well have flown other types of aircraft in the simulator , for his own purposes			2
regardless , he would n't require this device to execute a nefarious plot			2
an 18,000 - hour captain already has all the resources , i.e. charts and manuals , including his own experience			2
the captain completes a cell phone call prior to takeoff			2
judging by the distance from the main terminal to the runway , this cell phone call was most likely made after pushback from the gate at @entity74			2
yes , this was a violation of the sterile period ( during which extraneous activity outside of aircraft operations should not occur ) and not quite up to professional standards but not a big deal			2
most likely , the captain made the call while the airplane had been safely stopped on a taxiway			0
it does not imply malicious intent			0
as of this writing , information has not been released regarding the details of the phone call			0
at 12:36 a.m. , @entity92 370 contacts the @entity74 tower and receives a clearance to hold short of @entity95 at the departure end , my translation from a non-verified transcript			1
at 12:40 a.m. , @entity92 370 receives clearance to take off			1
at 12:42 a.m. , @entity92 370 receives a clearance to climb to 18,000 feet and is directed to the @entity103 waypoint , approximately 300 miles away , the entry point into @entity106 's airspace			1
although the transcript timeline seems abridged , having eliminated communication with other aircraft that had to be on the frequency , it appears that the co-pilot reported the altitude level at 35,000 feet on three occasions			0
apparently , this repeated report has caused concern			1
my colleagues will agree that the most diplomatic method to remind an air - traffic controller that you had requested a higher altitude would be to state your current altitude			0
it 's a subtle hint in air - traffic control parlance			1
maybe the original clearance was filed for a higher flight level than 35,000 feet			1
at 1:07 , @entity128 ( the @entity129 and @entity130 ) gives what turns out to be its final report			1
also at this time , it was alleged that an additional waypoint not on the original flight plan had been entered into the flight management computer			1
the implication is that someone in the cockpit had intent to veer off - course for nefarious purposes			0
i believe that if indeed a waypoint was entered -- and it seems difficult to verify with the @entity128 no longer reporting -- it was entered as a means to identify an equal - time point			0
such a point is a position on the route that indicates the flight is equal in time to two or more diversionary airports			1
it is a required dispatch calculation prior to departure but an optional entry on the flight management computer			1
at 1:19 , a @entity156 air - traffic controller instructs @entity92 370 to contact @entity157 ( @entity106 radar ) on frequency 120.9			1
the co-pilot responds with the now - famous " all right , good night			0
" although the correct response would have been to repeat the frequency , the co-pilot was informal			0
crews that have flown that route know that the frequency does n't change			0
it is printed on the en route chart			0
at 1:21 , the transponder ceases to send out its coded discrete signal that identifies the flight			1
perhaps the beginning of a malfunction in the electronics and engineering compartment ? 9			0
at 1:37 , the automatic @entity128 transmission does not give its 30 - minute report			0
had the problem become a full - blown emergency ? 10			0
an undocumented report that a @entity182 , @entity183 - bound flight is asked by @entity157 to attempt contact with @entity92 370			1
the @entity182 flight is approximately 30 minutes ahead but is unable to establish contact with @entity92 370			1
this attempted " relay " would have been a typical procedure used by air - traffic control			0
@entity157 would have first attempted contact on the assigned frequency and then used the emergency frequency that all controllers and airlines monitor			0
there is cause for concern but no reason just yet to sound the alarm			1
at 2:15 , @entity92 military radar ( disclosed one week after the disappearance ) claims to have observed a primary target on the west side of the @entity92 peninsula , indicating that the flight flew a westerly course at some point after the last verbal transmission			1
in my view , the above timeline only includes what appears to be the most credible assertions			0
subsequent to this timeline , reports of satellite " pings " and engine data being transmitted indicate that the airplane may have remained airborne for an additional five to seven hours			1
without verification and true understanding regarding the implications of these reports , it is difficult to speculate			0
coming together : flight 370 search unites global community in addition , raw data from another radar site indicated that the 777 may have climbed to an altitude above the airplane 's certified ceiling and then quickly descended and climbed again			1
and now the most recent assertion has the airplane descending to 12,000 feet			0
if in fact the airplane descended to 12,000 feet , its fuel consumption would have been almost double that at the higher altitudes			0
in that regard , how did the airplane fly so far south into the @entity239 , as has now been announced emphatically by the @entity92 prime minister ? assuming the airplane did indeed continue to fly , here is a hypothetical scenario : a smoldering fire began to affect the components in the electronics and engineering compartment			1
the fire was insidious , producing smoke at a slowly increasing rate			0
as components began to fail , the crew followed appropriate checklists until it was determined that the primary concern was to land the airplane			1
the captain entered the waypoint identifier for a diversionary airport into the flight management computer			1
the autopilot turned the airplane toward the diversionary airport , a southwesterly direction			1
in the meantime , the crew attempted to control an airplane that may have been losing portions of its electronic flight control systems			1
primary flight displays on the instrument panel may have begun to shut down , making it difficult to interpret airplane attitude and airspeed			1
the crew donned their oxygen masks with the integral goggles , but toxic fumes , low visibility etc. eventually overcame them when the oxygen bottled was depleted due to the pilots both breathing rapidly in a high - stress environment and the mask switch most likely being selected to 100 % at high pressure			0
a degraded autopilot continued to steer the airplane toward the diversion airport at an altitude selected by the crew			1
when the airplane reached the last waypoint -- the diversionary airport -- the flight management computer functioned as designed and kept the airplane on its last heading			1
fuel exhaustion caused the engines to flame out one at a time			0
operating on one engine for a brief period may have caused a turn due to the differential power that could n't be compensated by a degraded automatic system			0
when the autopilot could no longer maintain the airplane at the selected altitude , it disconnected			2
the airplane would have begun a slow , erratic descent			0
when the last engine shut down , the ram air turbine would have deployed , providing both limited hydraulic power and limited electric power			0
eventually , the airplane would have descended and crashed into the ocean			0
a lot of focus has been on the fact that the crew did not communicate the problem			0
maybe they did attempt to declare a " mayday			0
" had the primary radios been destroyed by fire ? or more likely , the communication went unheard because the airspace where the malfunction occurred was just out of the range of normal vhf communications , in addition to being just outside @entity157 's radar			2
it is all pure speculation until the airplane is located			0
i 'd like to keep an open mind			0
regardless , perhaps i 've explained some of the unexplainable			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity338 .			1

pilot @entity338 : evidence on flight 370 is consistent with a mechanical concern
he says the plane might have been flying on autopilot in its final hours
all explanations are speculative until the plane 's components are found , @entity338 says
