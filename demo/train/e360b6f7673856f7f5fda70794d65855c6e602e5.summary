-- @entity0 legal analyst @entity1 recently highlighted a fact that few in the @entity4 are even aware of : tens of thousands of @entity4 who hold @entity4 passports are denied legal recognition as @entity4 citizens			1
the reason ? they happen to be born in the @entity4 territory of @entity13 instead of somewhere else in the @entity4			1
@entity1 gets the basic unfairness of it all right : " the @entity4 laid claim to these eastern islands of a @entity19 archipelago in 1900 , and since that time , @entity13 have served in the @entity4 military , including the wars in @entity22 and @entity23			1
" but his conclusion that " citizenship for them is not a constitutional right " because " only @entity28 can choose to grant citizenship to territorial inhabitants " rests on an assumption that has no basis in the @entity33 or any decision by the @entity4 @entity35			1
it is easy to see where this assumption comes from			0
after the @entity4 acquired @entity37 and other territories in 1898 after the @entity39 , the @entity35 decided a series of deeply divided and controversial cases known as the @entity42			2
while none of these cases addressed constitutional issues relating to citizenship , justice @entity43 wrote an opinion in @entity48 that suggested , in passing , that citizenship was not a fundamental right in these newly acquired areas , which were populated by what he called " alien races			0
" although his opinion was not joined by a single other justice , it was good enough for those in @entity28 who thought birthright citizenship was not such a great idea for the inhabitants of these areas , who did not look like or speak like them			0
the assumption that @entity28 controls citizenship in overseas territories has survived since , but not without disagreement in the lower courts			2
@entity67 , the @entity68 , and several others born in @entity13 are challenging this faulty assumption in a federal lawsuit pending before the @entity72			1
they argue that so long as @entity13 is under the @entity4 flag , with @entity13 's sons and daughters fighting and dying to defend that flag , the @entity4 @entity33 guarantees them birthright citizenship , regardless of what @entity28 has said			1
what does the @entity33 itself say ? the @entity81 of the 14th amendment -- part of the @entity33 since 1868 -- states that " all persons born ... in the @entity4 , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the @entity4			1
" the great chief justice @entity88 explained decades earlier that the @entity33 used the phrase " the @entity4 " as " the name given to our great republic , which is composed of states and territories			2
" it is no surprise then that those who drafted the @entity81 understood its guarantees to extend to @entity4 territories , explaining that " the first section ( of the 14th amendment ) refers to persons everywhere , whether in the states or in the territories or in the @entity104			1
" just four years after the @entity81 was ratified , the @entity35 stated that the clause " put to rest " the notion that " those ... who had been born and resided always in the @entity104 or in the territories , though within the @entity4 , were not citizens			2
" this original understanding makes sense			0
the 14th amendment was intended to overturn the @entity35 's infamous @entity113 decision and put the question of citizenship by birth on all @entity4 soil beyond @entity28 ' power to deny			1
in 1868 , nearly half of all land in the @entity4 was in a @entity4 territory			2
an amendment that failed to guarantee citizenship in @entity4 territories would not have been much of an amendment at all			1
birthright citizenship remains a hotly debated topic			0
but there is a remarkable cross-ideological consensus among legal scholars about what exactly the @entity33 guarantees when it comes to birthright citizenship			0
former @entity4 solicitor general @entity133 , who represented president @entity134 in @entity135 , and @entity137 professor @entity136 , a renowned liberal scholar , argued in a 2008 joint memo that sen. @entity139 was eligible to run for president based solely on his place of birth : the @entity143 , a former @entity4 territory			0
@entity145 and @entity146 explained that " birth on soil that is under the sovereignty of the @entity4 , but not within a state " satisfies the requirement for being a " ' natural born ' citizen , " in light of " the well - established principle that ' natural born ' citizenship includes birth within the territory and allegiance of the @entity4			2
" president @entity160 's solicitor general @entity159 and former @entity162 solicitor general @entity161 have echoed similar views on the geographic scope of birthright citizenship			0
what the @entity42 mean for @entity4 territories today also remains hotly debated			0
on wednesday the @entity137 is holding a conference titled " reconsidering the @entity42 , " with federal circuit judge @entity169 delivering the keynote address " the @entity42 : a declaration of their bankruptcy			0
" @entity169 has long compared the @entity42 to @entity174 , criticizing the @entity42 as establishing a race - based doctrine of " separate and unequal " status for residents of overseas @entity4 territories			2
in 2008 , the @entity35 also expressed skepticism of the idea that @entity28 has the power to deny constitutional rights in current @entity4 territories , stating that " it may well be that over time the ties between the @entity4 and any of its unincorporated territories strengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance			0
" the court went on to explain that " the @entity33 grants @entity28 and the president the power to acquire , dispose of , and govern territory , not the power to decide when and where its terms apply			0
" although the @entity33 grants @entity28 broad powers in @entity4 territories , one that it clearly withholds is the power to rewrite the @entity194 's guarantee of birthright citizenship			1
denying citizenship in @entity13 is not just unfair , it 's unconstitutional			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

@entity200 : there 's a *compelling* legal case for citizenship for @entity13 @entity13 residents
he says the 14th @entity194 provides citizenship for all *people* subject to the @entity4
courts have disagreed on the matter , but @entity200 's lawsuit is pending in federal court
