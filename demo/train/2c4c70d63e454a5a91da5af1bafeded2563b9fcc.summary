@entity0 and @entity1 were not in the @entity3 appellate court monday for the opening day of their appeal against their 2009 convictions for the 2007 murder of @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity1 were convicted of @entity12 's murder in a highly divisive murder trial that , at times , pitted @entity15 against @entity16 who formed two camps			1
the " innocentisti " or those who supported @entity10 's innocence were convinced the @entity16 court was corrupt and spoon fed by a very successful public relations campaign out of @entity22 , @entity23			1
the " colpevolisti " were those who thought @entity10 was culpable in either the murder or the perceived cover up			2
@entity12 was found semi-nude in a student apartment she shared with @entity10 and two @entity16 women			1
in an early interrogation , @entity10 confessed to being in the house when @entity12 was killed , describing her screams in vivid detail			1
she later retracted the confession and accused @entity41 police of hitting her on the back of the head			2
@entity45 , the @entity41 prosecutor who won the original conviction and then lost the appeal also did not attend monday 's hearing , but almost everyone else from the original trials was there , including @entity9 , the @entity53 bartender @entity10 originally accused of @entity12 's murder			1
@entity55 attended almost every hearing of the earlier trials and his presence underscored the complexity of the case			0
" i am proof that @entity0 is a liar , " he told @entity61 on monday			2
" that 's why i am here			0
" @entity55 spent several weeks in jail after @entity10 accused him of @entity12 's murder , and he definitively won a defamation suit against her , for which she was ordered to pay â‚¬ 22,000 ( $ 29,800 ) for his court costs			1
his lawyer @entity67 told the court monday that @entity10 had not yet paid that fine			1
there were even locals from @entity41 who were fixtures in the public gallery during the original trials who made the trip to @entity3 to see the story through			2
@entity0 : ' i 'm afraid to go back ' to @entity16 serious place the presiding judge , @entity81 , and the assisting judge , @entity83 , oversaw the proceedings in the austere @entity85 in a nondescript suburb of @entity3 , far away from the tourist attractions like the @entity88 and @entity89			1
six lay judges and two alternates -- who act more as conscientious objectors to bring the voice of the people to the judicial proceeding than as @entity15 - style jurors who have absolute voting power -- were draped in sashes with the colors of the @entity16 flag			2
the presiding judge , whose deep baritone voice filled the courtroom , interrupted the lawyers when they were long - winded , and had little patience for any distractions in the court			0
only once , when a journalist 's mobile phone rang out the @entity112 music used as the " @entity117 " theme tune -- which gave prosecutor @entity114 a momentary case of the giggles -- did the mood lighten			0
the rest of the time , @entity81 's court was a serious place			2
the court is meeting to hear a new appeal by @entity10 and @entity1 , whose 2011 acquittal was overturned by @entity16 's @entity125 based on what judges said were " shortcomings , contradictions and inconsistencies , " writing in their final reasoning " too many questions remain unanswered			1
" half of all cases in @entity16 are altered some way during the appellate process , so @entity10 's case is not an anomaly			1
@entity139 , the lawyer representing @entity12 , told @entity61 : " the high court ruling will be the guide the defense teams for @entity10 and @entity1 will need to follow to try to win another acquittal			1
" the session began with the judge reading out the facts of the case , beginning with the discovery of @entity12 's semi-nude body in the apartment she shared with @entity10 in 2007 , and ending with the @entity125 's decision to overturn the acquittal			1
@entity81 also read the details of the @entity9 aspect of the case			0
@entity156 , an @entity157 native who was convicted in a fast - track trial for his role in @entity12 's murder in 2008 , has been definitively convicted for his role in the murder in the case , passing the first degree , appeal and high court , which is necessary for any case in @entity16 to be considered definitive			1
the court ruled that he was one of three murderers , but did not name the other two			0
@entity156 's sentence was reduced from 30 to 16 years on appeal meaning he will be eligible for parole in 2016			0
the discovery of @entity156 's fingerprints in @entity12 's bedroom is what led to @entity55 's release			1
@entity10 concedes being ' tone - deaf ' in days after roommate 's murder defense requests @entity81 then asked for the defense teams to list their requests for the court , which included retesting some of the crucial evidence in the case , like @entity12 's bra clasp on which @entity1 's dna was found , but which had been left for 47 days in the murder room before it was collected			1
the judge did not allow the retesting of the clasp			0
the defense teams also asked that a suspect stain , which was referred to as the " sperm stain " on a pillow found under @entity12 's body be tested			1
during the original trial , investigators chose to test a bloody foot print on the pillow instead of the stain because they presumed it was old stain , and most likely from @entity12 's boyfriend			1
they also wanted to take another look at what they called the lack of evidence of a clean - up by @entity10 and @entity1			2
the judge again denied the requests			0
the judge did agree to accept three of the defense 's requests			0
one was to retest a knife found in @entity1 's apartment with @entity10 's dna on the handle and what was found to be @entity12 's dna in a groove on the blade			1
the blade sample was too small to retest , so the results were not considered valid by the original appellate court			0
the new appellate judge agreed to have another stain on the knife , which had never been tested , subjected to forensic review			0
@entity227 testimony the new appellate court also ruled to accept the testimony from @entity230 , a witness who testified in the first appeal			0
@entity230 -- who served time with @entity1 in jail -- had written to the court to say that his brother @entity234 had killed @entity12 and that the knife he had used was buried in a garden in @entity41			1
he testified in court : " my brother came in and sat on the sofa			0
the right arm of his jacket was ripped and he could see blood on his arm			0
my brother then pulled out a pocket knife and a set of keys			0
he did n't want to create problems for me in @entity41			0
my brother was very emotional			0
" he said that his brother then buried the murder weapon in a garden			0
@entity230 's brother is currently on the run , according to @entity41 police who tried to find him to investigate the allegations			2
the defense asked that @entity230 's testimony be heard again since @entity41 police apparently did not investigate the mysterious claim			2
the new appellate judge also accepted a request to enter into evidence photos of @entity1 's bitten fingernails taken the day after the murder			2
a lawyer for @entity1 , @entity265 , told @entity61 that the photos proved that @entity1 did not have enough nail to successfully pry off the clasp of @entity12 's bra			1
" he bit his nails , " @entity265 said			0
" there is no way he could have unclasped the bra			0
" the court adjourned until friday , october 4 , when @entity230 will testify and investigators from the @entity276 -- @entity16 's department of defense staff information and security -- in @entity280 will be given the mandate to retest the knife			1
@entity10 says she will not attend the trial , but @entity1 is expected to attend some sessions , his father said			2
an appeal verdict is expected by the end of the year			0
opinion : what @entity10 can and ca n't tell us			0

@entity0 and @entity1 were in 2009 convicted of @entity9 's murder
in 2011 , they were acquitted of the crime , but in march 2013 @entity16 's high court ordered a retrial
the retrial began in @entity3 monday but has been adjourned until october 4
@entity12 's body was found in 2007 in the @entity41 flat she and @entity10 shared with two others
