-- controversy in figure skating ? what took so long ? and @entity3 and the @entity4 play to a familiar result on the hockey rink , while a @entity3 faced long odds in the ski cross final four			1
cue the conspiracists figure skating , like beauty , is in the eyes of the beholder			0
and to some the decision of the judges at thursday 's women 's free program was downright ugly			1
as was the subsequent reaction on social media			0
it did n't help that one of the judges had in the past been suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the @entity25 16 years ago ( apparently they do n't have a commissioner @entity26 in figure skating )			1
or that another is married to the head of the @entity31 figure skating federation , which is cheering for the first @entity31 woman to win a gold medal in individual competition after she was awarded the highest score of her life			1
it was too much for defending @entity39 champion @entity38 to overcome			0
not everyone thinks the judging was crooked			0
even though gold medalist @entity42 had one notable mistake , she did have the more technical program			2
and that 's where she won ; her technical score was 75.54 ; @entity38 's was 69.69			2
@entity48 of @entity49 wrote : " it 's debatable , but not a robbery			2
@entity42 skated well enough to win gold			2
she had a carefully constructed program with seven triples , five of which were in a combo			0
@entity38 had six and three , respectively			0
thus , @entity42 was going in with a higher total and made more margin for error , which she took advantage of with a minor hop after one exchange			0
" @entity42 said she knew she had skated well			0
" when i had performed all the elements i knew i would be on the podium but not which medal			2
when i saw i had won on the technical elements i did n't believe my eyes , " she said			0
there might be more of an argument that @entity42 's short program score of 74.64 was a real gift			0
we 'd like more of that here 's an idea for the women 's hockey tournament			1
just make it @entity3 vs. the @entity4 in a best four out of seven games format			1
especially if the games will be as well - played and exciting and heart - pounding and heartbreaking and magnificent and frustrating and enthralling and agonizing and stirring and mind - blowing as the one played thursday			0
depending on whose side you were on , you 'll always remember this one as either a great display of @entity3 spirit or the one the @entity4 let get away			1
and really , the 3 - 2 @entity3 victory in overtime was both			1
@entity3 did n't score for the first 56:34 of the gold medal game then found net three times in 11 - plus minutes			1
of the women 's four olympic gold medals in the sport , this is the one that will be most cherished .			1
