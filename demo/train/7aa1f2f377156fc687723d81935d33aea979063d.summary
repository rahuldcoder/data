@entity0 -- some people see a silver lining and go looking for a cloud			2
they just ca n't feel good about the world they live in , even when they 're presented with a feel - good story			1
instead of rejoicing in a positive development , they 're critical and cynical and mean			0
you 'll find these folks in both political parties , and all across the ideological spectrum			0
this includes the left - leaning media and the liberal blogosphere , where they seem to have a tough time praising a @entity18 for doing something right			2
and some on the right would probably say that about me			0
i 've spent plenty of time in the last quarter century writing about things that @entity18 do wrong			0
but criticizing republicans when they deserve it does n't stop me from giving credit where it 's due			2
so let 's give credit to @entity32 , the 38 - year - old son of the 2012 @entity18 presidential nominee , who , police have confirmed , helped four people -- a husband , wife , and two teenage sons -- after a car crash in @entity40 , @entity41			1
it all happened on @entity43 night			0
after dinner with his parents and family , @entity32 was driving home with his wife and children when , he told reporters , he saw a car speed by him and crash into the kitchen of a home			1
he rushed to the scene of the crash			1
he said that he helped the four passengers out of the wreckage of the car and , police confirmed , he walked them to the front lawn so they could get medical attention			2
an adult male was in the basement of the home at the time , and he was n't injured			0
and the family was n't seriously injured			0
afterward , @entity32 went to @entity69 -- the modern - day town square -- and tweeted about the experience			1
he included a photo of himself standing next to the wreckage			0
this being a photo , he was smiling			0
the tweet simply read : " was first on scene to big accident , see pic of car in the house			1
i lifted 4 people out to safety			0
â € ” @entity32 ( @ joshromney )			2
not exactly a victory lap , is it ? yet , for his trouble , the hero of this story got hammered by the left and other @entity69 users			0
" why are you smiling like a tourist at such a horrific scene ? " wrote @entity69 user @entity94 in reaction to @entity32 's tweet			1
others wrote that @entity32 's post constituted a classic " humblebrag , " a kind of sneaky boast where someone uses 140 characters to show off without letting it show			1
we are told that some consider " humblebragging " to be an even worse breach of etiquette than plain ol ' generic bragging because it tends to be served up with a side of fake modesty			2
# seriously ? this is what we 've come to ? we now go hunting for bad behavior , even when someone does a good deed			2
is this sort of thing a result of boredom or poor manners ? @entity128 reported that the term " humblebrag " was coined in 2011 by @entity131 comedian @entity130			0
it noted the blowback this way : " @entity32 , @entity136 's son , is drawing some flak after rescuing four people from a car crash on @entity43			1
it was n't the act itself that sparked the ire of so many on social media , but rather the tweet he posted in the aftermath of his self - acknowledged heroism			1
" @entity149 reported this : " @entity32 says he helped rescue victims of a car crash in @entity41 , but now he 's getting grief for talking about it on @entity69			1
" i admit that posing in front of wreckage from an auto accident is a little creepy			0
and , even in the age of @entity69 , it should be possible to render aid to those who need it without feeling compelled to broadcast it all over the @entity165			0
and yet , it 's hard to detect any amount of gloating either in the text of @entity32 's tweet , or in the statement he issued the day after the accident , part of which read : " my family and i are grateful that no one was seriously injured and glad to have been able to help those affected by this terrible accident			1
what i did to help the people involved in the accident is what anyone else would do who witnessed such a potentially dangerous situation			0
" this young man sounds like a class act			1
which is more than i can say for those petty souls who , in this case , went out of their way to cast a good @entity191 in a bad light			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : some look for gloom even in feel - good stories , like that of @entity32 's tweet
@entity32 tweeted picture of himself , saying he was first on scene of crash , helped victims
he was *slammed* *online* for " humblebragging " ; @entity195 : really ? helping a bad thing ?
@entity195 : he sounds like a class act -- more than the haters *deriding* a good @entity191
