-- @entity1 was a sea of smartphones snapping photos on monday throughout the pomp and circumstance of @entity7			1
between the glamorous gowns , the presidential oath , and the parade of marching bands , it was a day meant to be documented			2
but we made a discovery during it all : just as interesting as the photos themselves were the people taking them			1
back in 2009 , the inauguration was a huge deal -- an estimated 1.8 million people packed the @entity22 to see @entity24 's first @entity25 - @entity24 president make history			1
not surprisingly , @entity27 saw a record number of contributions that day : nearly 12,000 submissions of " the moment , " when president @entity32 took the oath of office			1
this time , things were different			2
there were fewer attendees -- officials estimated between 800,000 to 900,000 people attended monday 's inauguration			1
but , more importantly , the social media landscape has dramatically changed in the past four years			0
so this time around , we invited our audience to document the inauguration through @entity44 , the mobile photo - sharing site that was launched in october 2010 and now boasts an impressive 90 million monthly active users			1
the call to action was simple -- we invited attendees to take an @entity44 shot of themselves during the inaugural festivities , tag the photo # cnn , and share why they made the trek to @entity1 -- and the end result was fantastic			1
between sunday and monday , we received more than 10,300 photos and showcased some of the best submissions in a custom interactive			1
others uploaded photos to @entity27 , @entity0 's global participatory news community			1
together , the photos tell you a story about the people assembled for @entity32 's second inauguration			1
the crowd was diverse , made up of people old and young , black and white			1
there were families and groups of friends			0
for some , it was their first inauguration			1
others were back to see @entity32 's inaugural speech a second time			0
it was cold and sunny , as evidenced by the number of winter hats and sunglasses in the crowd			2
at least one attendee , though , used her shades to block more than just the sunshine			0
" i was a total crybaby out there , " she wrote			0
@entity24 flags were the other accessory du jour			0
" do n't even think about going without a flag , " advised @entity87 , mother of two young girls			0
at least one attendee made a point to stand out among the rest -- in a clever homemade " @entity93 " costume			0
there were notable attendees in the crowd -- " @entity104 's " @entity97 , rep. @entity98 , @entity100 - @entity99 , and comedian @entity101 all joined the @entity44 + @entity27 project -- alongside average citizens			1
and most everyone was grinning ear to ear , except for one man who documented his frustration with the glitchy @entity22 television feed			0
finally , there were the stories behind the photos			2
@entity114 shared a photo of her husband , gunnery sgt. @entity116 , who was chosen to escort inaugural vips onto the stage			0
@entity114 and their children were glued to the television set at home in @entity123 hoping to see @entity116 in action			0
" we caught a glimpse of him standing to the right of the president , " she gushed			0
political science student @entity130 took notes during the ceremony			0
" i plan on pursuing a career in national politics , " he said			0
" now that i am beginning to lay out the work for my future career , this inauguration is my first step			2
" and for @entity140 , attending the inauguration meant she could cross off an item on her " bucket list			2
" " to be part of something that is so patriotic and historic is so exciting , " she said			1
" i think every @entity24 should ( attend an inauguration ) in their life			2

@entity27 and @entity44 *teamed* up to see who attended the inauguration and why
more than 10,300 people sent in photos , and the pictures paint a diverse *portrait* of the crowd
" to be part of something that is so patriotic and historic is so exciting , " said one @entity158
