a few years ago , @entity1 science correspondent @entity0 reported about patients who were receiving modern artificial body parts to help them recover from the loss of the limb			1
now , facing his own recovery after losing an arm while on a reporting trip to @entity9 , @entity0 is reviewing that story , reminding himself of which experts he should consult			1
he talked with @entity14 affiliate @entity13 on thursday in his first interview after a surgeon removed his left arm just above the elbow			2
he said he was going to see some doctors over the next few days			0
and he tried to look on the bright side of needing technological help with his life			0
" if nothing else , this is a great opportunity for me to buy some really cool new gadgets , right ? " he told the station			1
" i look forward to see what technology can do for me			0
" it seemed minor at the time @entity0 was stacking cases onto a cart on february 12 after a reporting trip to @entity33 and the @entity34 , and one of the cases fell on his left forearm			1
he thought it was a minor injury and did n't experience a lot of pain until the next night			0
he went to a doctor the next morning and was told he was experiencing acute compartment syndrome , which involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment			1
during surgery , @entity0 's blood pressure fell to the point where his life was in danger			1
the doctor made the choice to take much of the arm			2
@entity0 , 54 , said his personal doctor studied the charts and agreed that amputation was the best option			1
" he said it probably would have been the same consequence , wherever i would have been , " he said			0
@entity0 said he is dealing with phantom pain , as if his forearm and hand were still there			1
and he admitted that he 's had his mental ups and downs			2
@entity0 , an award - winning science journalist and former @entity14 correspondent and anchor , said work is a welcome tonic			1
thursday , he was moderating a panel on climate change at the @entity72 in the @entity74 area			0
@entity0 revealed his story in a blog post entitled " @entity77 " on wednesday			1
" i wish i had a better story to tell you about why i am typing this with one hand ( and some help from @entity83 ) , " he wrote			0
he said that fans , friends and co-workers should n't worry about him			0
pressure builds up the @entity88 says muscles in the arms and legs are separated from each other by thick layers of tissue called fascia , and each fascia has space in it , called a compartment , with muscle tissue , nerves and blood vessels			2
when there is swelling in a compartment , pressure in that area will increase and press on the muscles , blood vessels and nerves			2
" if this pressure is high enough , blood flow to the compartment will be blocked , " according to the @entity88 's @entity114 resource			1
" this can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves			0
if the pressure lasts long enough , the muscles may die and the arm or leg will not work anymore			0
it may need to be amputated			0
" symptoms of severe cases of compartment syndrome include skin paleness , numbness , tingling , decreased sensation , weakness and severe worsening pain			1
early diagnosis and treatment are key for a good recovery			0
amputee pilot : @entity0 could return to flying ' in no time ' patients need immediate surgery , which involves making long cuts through the muscle tissue to relieve pressure			2
@entity0 , who covered the @entity142 space program and was an anchor for @entity14 , now lives in @entity74			2
