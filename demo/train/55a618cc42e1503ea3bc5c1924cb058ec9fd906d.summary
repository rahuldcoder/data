@entity0 -- defense attorneys for @entity0 police officer @entity3 , accused of a cannibalism plot , tried thursday to show their client engaged in " fantasy role - play " during online conversations with his three alleged co-conspirators			1
reviewing aloud the text during cross-examination of prosecution witness @entity12 , defense attorney @entity9 sought to make the @entity14 agent counter his prior testimony that @entity3 's e-mails and online chats with others who said they were interested in cannibalism were real			1
prosecutors have argued that @entity3 was " deadly serious " about online plans to allegedly kidnap , rape , torture , cook and eat women			1
none of @entity3 's alleged targets was ever victimized			1
defense attorneys have argued that their client 's conduct was " pure fiction , " " make believe " and fantasy role - playing			2
also thursday , prosecutors submitted evidence to support their claim that @entity3 accessed a national database to look for information about three women -- twice in july 2011 and once in may 2012			1
the evidence presented revealed @entity3 's unique police officer identification number , which corresponds with the identification number used to search the names of his alleged victims			1
graphic e-mails read at @entity0 cannibalism plot trial prosecutors also presented evidence that @entity3 had twice trained on the system and that he would have been instructed not to access the database for personal reasons			1
@entity3 is also charged with accessing the @entity52 database illegally			2
the defense thursday tried to show that @entity3 provided false information about the alleged targets ' locations to some people he wrote online			2
in one instance , @entity3 said the woman was at a college four hours away , even though she attended school in @entity0			0
in other instances , he said he was watching an alleged target , when she really lived in @entity65			0
records indicate @entity3 never went to @entity65			0
@entity3 repeated the same conversations with the alleged co-conspirators months later , reintroducing the name of the alleged target , and renegotiating a price to kidnap her			1
@entity3 never gave addresses when asked and said in some instances he did n't have the women 's addresses , records show			1
court records show that @entity3 did have the addresses of his alleged targets , from sending them a police charity card that he claimed would " get ( them ) out of a minor traffic violation " if they are pulled over by police			2
prosecutor @entity86 argued that the police charity card was a ruse -- an attempt to gain personal information about the women			0
@entity3 planned to kidnap three women during the week of february 20 , 2012 , prosecutors said , pointing to some of the e-mails and chats			1
@entity9 asked @entity97 repeatedly if he still thought that those were real conversations			0
@entity97 replied , " yes , sir			0
" the defense reviewed online chats between @entity3 and a man identified as " @entity102 " or " @entity103 " or " meatmarketman , " who @entity3 met on the @entity105			2
" @entity112 , " who lives in the @entity114 , bragged in one conversation about one of his past victims , sending @entity3 a picture , and saying " tried her alive first , actually it was n't very good , very bloody			0
" prosecutors : officer was ' deadly serious ' " @entity112 " expressed concerns in the conversations about cooking his victim to death and how it might affect the meat , adding he " likes the idea of splitting the carcass			2
" in july 2012 , @entity3 told meatmarketman , " i am working on a document , everything we need to carry this out			2
" authorities said they found a document in @entity3 's account on his wife 's laptop titled " @entity137 and @entity138 -- a blueprint			1
" @entity97 testified about the document , revealed in court , which contained a picture of @entity143 and personal information , including her bra size and shoe size			0
@entity143 's testimony tuesday revealed that some of the information -- a different last name , birthplace , birthday and college education -- was inaccurate			0
the same document listed " materials needed " and included a gag , rope , chloroform and a tarp for the trunk			0
the @entity14 never found any of these items in his possession			0
references to the blueprint were found in chats the @entity14 deemed " fantasy role - play , " along with references to waterboarding and chloroform , terms frequently used in the online conversations			0
on redirect , the prosecution noted that none of the conversations between alleged co-conspirators made references to " just fantasy , " " make believe " or had instances where @entity3 wrote " it 's not real , " and " i am just talking fantasy , " as he did write in 80 % of the conversations with 21 other people found in his e-mail account			1
@entity97 testified that some of these fantasy conversations contained some " real " statements that reflected @entity3 's state of mind			1
in many of the chats deemed fantasy , the prosecution noted that @entity3 discussed story - writing fantasy partners			0
one story he was working on with another person featured " a restaurant that sells women in all varieties , sometimes grilled or roasted as whole , sometimes in steaks or pieces , sometimes a la carte , or in a buffet			0
" this was the fourth day of the trial of @entity3 , who has been a @entity0 police officer for six years .			1
