-- the same blue food dye found in @entity2 and @entity3 could be used to reduce damage caused by spine injuries , offering a better chance of recovery , according to new research			1
rats injected with @entity10 not only regained their mobility but temporarily turned blue			1
researchers at the @entity13 found that when they injected the compound @entity16 ( @entity10 ) into rats suffering spinal cord injuries , the rodents were able to walk again , albeit with a limp			1
the only side effect was that the treated mice temporarily turned blue			1
the results of the study , published in the " @entity24 , " build on research conducted by the same center five years ago			0
in august 2004 , scientists revealed how @entity29 triphosphate , which is known as @entity30 and described as the " energy currency of life , " surges to the spinal cord soon after injury occurs			2
researchers found that the sudden influx of @entity30 killed off healthy cells , making the initial injury far worse			2
but when they injected oxidized @entity30 into the injury , it was found to block the effect of @entity30 , allowing the injured rats to recover and walk again			1
" while we achieved great results when oxidized @entity30 was injected directly into the spinal cord , this method would not be practical for use with spinal cord - injured patients , " said lead researcher @entity43 , professor of neurosurgery and director of the @entity46 at the @entity13			2
" first , no one wants to put a needle into a spinal cord that has just been severely injured , so we knew we needed to find another way to quickly deliver an agent that would stop @entity30 from killing healthy motor neurons			2
second , the compound we initially used , oxidized @entity30 , can not be injected into the bloodstream because of its dangerous side effects			2
" back in 2004 , @entity43 's team discovered that the spinal cord was rich in a molecule called @entity66 , which is also known as " the death receptor " for its ability to allow @entity30 to latch onto motor neurons and send the signals which eventually kill them			0
@entity43 knew that @entity10 could thwart the function of @entity66 , and its similarity to a blue food dye approved by the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) in 1982 gave her the confidence to test it intravenously			1
the rats given @entity10 immediately after their injury could walk again with a limp			1
those that did n't receive a dose never regained their mobility			0
@entity43 told @entity0 that there is currently no standard treatment for patients with spinal injury when they reach the hospital emergency room			0
" right now we only treat 15 percent of the patients we receive with steroids and many hospitals question if that even works for that 15 percent ; it 's a very moderate benefit to only a subset of patients			0
so right now 85 percent of patients are untreated , " she said			0
@entity43 said the research team is n't claiming that @entity10 can cure spinal injuries , instead that it offers a potential improvement in patients ' condition			1
" even a moderate improvement in functional performance of the patient is a big , big event for these patients , " she said			0
" they can control their bladder			0
if they can just take small steps instead of sitting in a wheelchair all the time , it 's a tremendous benefit for these patients , " she added			0
the dose must be administered immediately after the injury , before additional tissue dies as a result of the initial injury			0
researchers are currently pulling together an application to be lodged with the @entity74 to stage the first clinical trials of @entity10 on human patients			1
" our hope is that this work will lead to a practical , safe agent that can be given to patients shortly after injury , for the purpose of decreasing the secondary damage that we have to otherwise expect , " said @entity125 , chair of the @entity13 @entity126 .			1

researchers find way to reduce secondary damage caused by spinal injuries
@entity10 is similar to blue food dye used in *sweets* , sports *drinks*
only side effect of intravenous injection was that it turned test rats blue
researchers are *planning* to apply to the @entity74 for *permission* for human tests
