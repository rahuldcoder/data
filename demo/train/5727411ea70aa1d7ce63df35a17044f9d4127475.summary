-- @entity1 inflicted a second successive @entity3 defeat on the @entity4 when one of football 's great rivalries was renewed on wednesday			1
these two nations have a fierce history , punctuated by on - field battles that the legendary @entity12 captain @entity11 claimed had cost him " years of my life			0
" this latest encounter was no classic , largely because @entity17 's @entity1 dominated for the vast majority			2
two superb first - half goals from @entity20 took his tally for the tournament to three and put the @entity12 in complete control			1
@entity24 pulled a goal back as @entity4 improved in the second half , but @entity1 comfortably held on for a second successive victory at this tournament			2
@entity29 's earlier last - gasp win over @entity30 means that nothing is yet decided in @entity32 however , @entity1 need only a point against @entity30 to reach the quarterfinals , while the @entity4 need something of a miracle to progress			1
@entity4 1 - 2 @entity1 striker @entity20 scored two stunning goals to earn @entity1 a deserved win and heighten expectation that @entity17 's side can win this @entity41			1
the @entity12 took control of a crucial game when @entity20 brilliantly collected @entity45 's pass and spun to slide home a clinical finish			0
it was 2 - 0 before the break as @entity20 scored an even better goal			1
@entity51 was the provider , his pass allowing @entity54 clubmate @entity20 to escape rookie defender @entity55 and fire across goalkeeper @entity56 and into the far corner for his 14th goal in his last 16 international games			0
the @entity60 were , briefly , ranked the number one team in the world as recently as august but they looked a poor imitation of the side that reached the @entity66 final in @entity67 two years ago			0
but a game between the two highest scoring teams in the qualifying campaign was always set to see goals and @entity24 's brilliant strike 17 minutes from time breathed life into an ailing game			0
the @entity78 striker 's touch had previously deserted him at this tournament , but he suddenly looked deadly as he spun away from @entity80 and smashed a superb shot past @entity82 with his weaker right foot			0
@entity1 's young side suddenly looked vulnerable , but limited the @entity60 to long - range efforts that failed to trouble @entity82 again			0
@entity29 3 - 2 @entity30 substitute @entity87 rescued @entity29 with a stunning late winner to give @entity90 's side real hope of reaching the quarterfinals of @entity3			1
forward @entity93 appeared to have denied @entity29 a crucial victory as he struck twice to wipe out a 2 - 0 lead			1
@entity96 missed a glorious chance to restore @entity29 's advantage but substitute @entity87 had the final say with a remarkable winner			1
@entity102 's left - wing cross invited a volley but @entity87 swung wildly with his left foot and completely missed , only to spin and smash home the loose ball with his right			0
it was a remarkable finish to a remarkable game and it left @entity29 and @entity30 locked together on three points each after two @entity32 games			2
@entity90 's side urgently needed a win after losing their opening game to @entity1 , one of the tournament favorites , and they swept into a two - goal lead to take control of the tie			2
@entity121 defender @entity120 , who had hit the bar against @entity1 , had a change of luck to open the scoring , timing his run to perfection to flick home a near - post header from @entity130 's corner			0
striker @entity131 doubled the lead when he steered home @entity134 's low center , but @entity93 's close - range header gave @entity30 hope before halftime			2
the @entity78 striker pounced again 10 minutes from time when he headed home @entity141 's cross -- his sixth international goal in just five appearances against @entity29			0
those are the sort of statistics more usually associated with @entity96 , but the @entity29 captain had an off - day , missing two clear chances before substitute @entity87 spared his blushes .			1

@entity1 beat @entity4 2 - 0 in latest renewal of one of football 's great rivalries
@entity20 scores twice to take his tournament tally to three goals
@entity29 seal 3 - 2 win over @entity30 in @entity32
substitute @entity87 hits stunning late winner after @entity93 double
