the recent @entity1 outbreak is becoming an issue in the competitive midterm elections			1
top @entity5 and @entity6 campaign officials in @entity7 are uncertain about the political ramifications of @entity1 's arrival in the @entity10 and are grappling with how to respond			1
but @entity11 are seizing on the issue as an opportunity to again make the case that president @entity15 is n't leading effectively			1
they 're highlighting @entity15 's recent assurance that @entity1 was " unlikely " to get to the @entity10 and calling for the @entity10 to impose new travel restrictions for those countries in @entity19 where the outbreak began			1
it 's all part of an effort to force their @entity5 opponents to defend @entity15 's response to @entity1			1
@entity6 officials have reason to believe their line of attack will resonate with voters			2
@entity30 has learned from sources at the @entity32 , the national campaign organization for @entity11 , that the group 's internal polling finds 60 percent of voters believe that if a single case of @entity1 arises in the @entity10 , it should be treated as a major crisis by the federal government			1
" @entity7 is broken , " claimed an @entity32 email			0
" the top - down approach championed by @entity5 for decades ( and controlled by them at the federal level in @entity7 ) has shown itself to be completely unprepared and ill - equipped for @entity44 challenges			0
" @entity5 have been supportive of the administration 's efforts , but are pushing for a coordinated effort with other countries to prevent further spread of @entity1			1
still , @entity6 candidates have picked up on the message			0
@entity54 @entity6 @entity53 candidate @entity52 called for a travel ban or other restrictions to ensure more infected people do not enter the country			1
" i 'm a mom			0
again , this is a safety and security issue , " @entity61 told @entity62			2
she called on the president and her opponent , @entity5 rep. @entity66 , who she is trailing in most polls , to outline a federal response			0
" the president needs to lead , " @entity61 said			2
" congressman @entity66 needs to lead -- to come up with a plan to make sure we can deal with this			1
" a spokeswoman for @entity66 told @entity30 that @entity74 is " desperate			0
" " it is sad @entity61 is now so desperate that she 's trying to use a deadly virus as a political issue , and it 's shameful , " spokeswoman @entity75 said			2
" before playing politics with such a serious issue , @entity61 should explain why she pushed for the government shutdown last year , which hampered the @entity83 and our nation 's emergency readiness			2
" in @entity92 , @entity87 , who is trying to unseat @entity89 @entity88 in one of the most closely watched @entity53 races this year , also called for a travel ban from @entity95 countries			1
" it 's time for @entity7 to take action to protect the @entity10 people , " said @entity87 , who many recent polls show is narrowly trailing @entity88			0
a @entity88 spokeswoman responded that @entity87 's approach would not do enough			0
" @entity88 believes the @entity10 should work together with the international community to take a wide range of steps to fight this epidemic and prevent it from spreading , " @entity102 said in an email			0
" travel restrictions may be one tool we can use , but they should be part of a broader strategy because simply sealing the borders to these countries wo n't make the crisis go away			2
" as far back as august , @entity117 @entity5 sen. @entity116 tried to use the issue of @entity1 against his opponent , @entity6 rep. @entity119			1
in a campaign ad , @entity116 accused @entity119 of voting against a 2013 bill that included money to respond to pandemics			0
but @entity119 did support the final version that became law , according to an analysis by @entity127			0
on friday , @entity119 signed a letter to @entity15 with fellow @entity129 from @entity117 urging him to consider a ban on flights to affected countries			1
" the quality of our hospitals , we well as our talented doctors , is undoubtedly a draw for people with the means and will to come to the @entity10 -- sometimes because exposure to @entity1 in their own country and in spite of the risk to the health of @entity10 , " the @entity6 congressmen wrote			1
@entity147 press secretary @entity146 told reporters friday that at this point , the @entity149 is not considering imposing any travel ban			0
in an interview on @entity30 friday , the number two official with the @entity53 @entity6 campaign arm , sen. @entity154 of @entity155 , said the @entity10 needs to be " more aggressive " in screening people coming to the country and pointed to recent report that said the @entity160 is not equipped right now to deal with a pandemic			2
" i do n't think we 're prepared as we should be , " @entity154 said			0
" i think this is another example where the administration was not as engaged early on as they should have been and now we 're playing catch - up			0
" aides for both the @entity147 @entity6 and @entity5 campaign committees tell @entity30 @entity1 has not cropped up in @entity147 races at this point			2
but that could change as political campaigns in recent weeks have been quick to focus their messages on issues that are on voters ' minds			0
soon after questions were raised about @entity15 's response to the terror group @entity179 , and public opinion polls showed @entity10 were increasingly worried about an attack at home , @entity6 candidates began bringing up the issue			1
the @entity184 rolled out television commercials suggesting several @entity5 candidates did n't support funding to respond to terrorists threats and they were " dangerous			0
" and though @entity190 is in recess for the final stretch before the midterm elections , a @entity147 committee announced on friday that it will hold a hearing on the @entity1 outbreak on oct. 16 .			1

@entity11 are seizing on the @entity1 issue to make a case against *democrats*
@entity53 candidate : @entity15 " needs to lead "
@entity190 will hold an @entity1 hearing on oct. 16
