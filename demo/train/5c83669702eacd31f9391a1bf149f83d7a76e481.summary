tackling the effects of climate change could cost governments around the world more than $ 100 billion a year , a @entity1 panel of experts said monday			1
a report by the @entity1 's @entity8 , says that a temperature rise of 2 degrees @entity9 will wipe out up to 2 % of the world 's income by 2050			1
but it says the price tag could grow even higher if the world 's governments fail to address the looming climate change			1
" if we get up to 4 degrees temperature rise , which most scientists now expect would happen if we carry on emitting greenhouse gasses as we do , then the cost could be much more severe , " @entity18 , a climate change researcher at @entity20 said			1
the combined cost of crop losses , rising sea levels , higher temperatures and fresh water shortages could mount of to between $ 70 and $ 100 billion a year , the report said			1
but these estimates do not account for catastrophic scenarios , which researchers said tend to have the most devastating effect			0
@entity36 , which swept through @entity38 in november , killed 6,000 people and cost more than $ 10 billion			0
when severe floods hit parts of the @entity43 earlier this year , the @entity40 estimated the overall cost to businesses to be $ 1.3 billion			2
and according to the @entity47 @entity46 , the 2012 drought -- the worst in 25 years -- pushed up poultry prices by 5.5 % and egg prices by 7 %			0
the report says crop yields will fall by 2 % per decade , as the rising temperature affects some of the world 's major crops -- such as rice , maze or wheat			0
carbon dioxide benchmark hits new heights , worries scientists @entity62 said that if people continue to emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere , the bill will grow for everyone			0
" it looks as though it 's about $ 125 worth of extra impact for every one more ton of @entity73 we put in the atmosphere -- that comes up to around $ 0.20 per a liter of gasoline , " he said			0
" businesses must expect that , if we are serious about climate change , at some point they are going to be charged that kind of money if they carry on using gas coal , oil , gas , fossil fuels which emit those kind of gasses to the atmosphere , " he added			2
the report , released in @entity95 , @entity96 , is the second part of the @entity8 's benchmark assessment of climate change , a document released every six years			1
nearly 1,000 scientists contributed to it			0

climate change could cost more than $ 100 billion a year , the @entity1 panel of experts said
experts say the bill could be much higher if emissions continue at the *current* pace
