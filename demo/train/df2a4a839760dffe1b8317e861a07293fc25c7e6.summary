-- a @entity2 judge wednesday evening issued a temporary injunction forbidding the release of any more prisoners pardoned or given clemency by outgoing gov. @entity7 , whose actions created an uproar			1
the pardons include four convicted murderers and a convicted armed robber who were released sunday			1
the five now must contact prison officials on a daily basis as their fate is adjudicated			2
the pardons are " a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and gov. @entity7 should be ashamed , " said state attorney general @entity22			1
the process of releasing 21 other inmates has been halted , said @entity22 , who sought the court order			1
a court hearing on the matter will be held january 23			2
@entity22 said @entity7 violated @entity2 's @entity28 because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted , as required			1
" he 's tried to rule the state like @entity36 and he did n't think the law applied to him , " @entity22 told @entity0 's @entity31 on wednesday night , referring to a character in the 1980s tv series " @entity34			1
" " these families are afraid out here , " @entity22 said of relatives of crime victims			1
@entity43 circuit court judge @entity42 issued the injunction , saying it appeared some pardons , including those for the four murderers , did not meet the 30 - day requirement			1
any inmates released in the future must meet the standard , @entity42 ruled			2
on his way out the door , the @entity54 governor approved full pardons for nearly 200 people , including 14 convicted murderers , according to documents the @entity2 secretary of state 's office released tuesday			1
the four murderers who received full pardons last week -- @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 -- were cited in @entity42 's order			1
they were all serving life sentences and worked as inmate trusties at the governor 's mansion , said @entity73 , spokeswoman for the @entity74			2
trusties are inmates who can receive additional rights through good behavior			0
@entity22 told " @entity85 " it 's possible that those who did n't meet the 30 - days requirement may have to return to prison and complete their sentences			1
@entity7 said wednesday that some people misunderstand the clemency process and believe that most of the individuals were still jailed			1
" approximately 90 percent of these individuals were no longer in custody , and a majority of them had been out for years , " he said in a statement			0
" the pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote			2
my decision about clemency was based upon the recommendation of the @entity102 in more than 90 percent of the cases , " @entity7 wrote			1
" the 26 people released from custody due to clemency is just slightly more than one - tenth of 1 percent of those incarcerated			2
" half of the people who were released were placed on indefinite suspension " due to ( chronic ) medical reasons because their health care expenses were costing the state so much money , " @entity7 said			1
@entity22 said he is questioning the release of many of the 175 individuals who received full pardons			1
@entity7 's full pardon of @entity64 has intensified fears that the man will try " to finish what he started , " one of his surviving victims said			1
" i feel like my safety is in jeopardy , " @entity126 , who was shot and wounded by @entity64 , said wednesday			0
" i wonder if he 's going to finish what he 's started			0
" @entity64 walked into a trailer in 1993 where his estranged wife , @entity132 , lived and shot her in the head as she held her 6 - week - old baby in her arms			0
@entity126 , the woman 's friend , survived a gunshot wound to the head			0
@entity64 was convicted of murder , aggravated assault and burglary of a residence			0
speaking in an interview with @entity0 's @entity145 , @entity126 and @entity146 , @entity132 's sister , expressed concerns about the release and fears that @entity64 may intend to target them			0
" i 'm married and have a family again , " @entity126 said			0
" i feel the safety for them is an issue			0
anybody that might be with me at the time that he decides to do something would be in jeopardy			0
" @entity64 's pardon also raised concerns from @entity162 , the prosecutor who saw him sent to prison			0
" @entity7 is insane for granting a pardon to this criminal , " said @entity162 , who is now in private practice			1
@entity167 said @entity7 -- who left office this week -- has n't responded to questions about the pardon			1
" he will not comment on anything			0
we have no answers as to why he has done this			0
i would like to think he did not have all of the facts of the case , if he did have all the facts , " she said			0
" apparently , we have n't had a really good man for our governor			0
" @entity7 's successor , @entity181 , was inaugurated tuesday			1
@entity167 shared the fears of those families watching convicted killers of their loved ones get blanket pardons and go free			2
" i 'm sure that they feel basically the same way as @entity126 and i do			0
we 're both fearful for our lives , our families ' lives , and we will live with this for the rest of our lives , " she said			0
@entity64 's whereabouts were unknown late wednesday			0
@entity7 , who served eight years in office , had previously granted full pardons to three other convicted killers in 2008			1
another three were awarded conditional or indefinite releases during his time in office -- meaning the governor , in total , granted reprieves to 20 convicted murderers , the documents showed			0
since the conservative governor took office in 2004 , 222 people were granted clemency for a wide variety of crimes			2
those who have been granted full pardons include shoplifters , rapists , burglars and embezzlers			2
there were also a number who were found guilty of either manslaughter or homicide , who were given unconditional pardons			2
@entity0 's @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
