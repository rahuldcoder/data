-- @entity2 ambassador @entity1 made a second trip to @entity4 on wednesday to answer questions from @entity7 senators about the september 11 attack on a @entity10 diplomatic mission in @entity11 that killed ambassador @entity12 and three other @entity10			1
@entity13 , who is believed to be president @entity15 's choice to replace @entity16 as secretary of state , triggered controversy with her appearance on television talk shows in the days after the @entity22 attack to explain what was known about it			1
she spoke from unclassified talking points provided by the intelligence community which said the armed assault was spontaneous and fueled by an anti-islam video produced in the @entity10 that had already sparked a notable protest in @entity30			2
@entity10 officials have since described it as a terror attack aimed at @entity10 interests			0
in a statement released after her @entity37 meetings on tuesday , @entity13 said that she explained to senators that " the talking points provided by the intelligence community -- and the initial assessment upon which they were based -- were incorrect in a key respect : there was no protest or demonstration in @entity22			1
while we certainly wish that we had had perfect information just days after the terrorist attack , as is often the case , the intelligence assessment has evolved			0
" opinion : @entity7 obsession with @entity22 makes no sense here are five questions around @entity13 's involvement in the controversy			1
q : why is @entity13 the focal point in the @entity22 attack ? a : @entity13 was the the @entity15 administration 's spokesman on sunday talk shows several days following the attack and made several claims that turned out to be wrong			1
the primary complaint from @entity7 is that @entity13 's remarks were centered on anger over the anti-islam film , " @entity69 , " when there was classified intelligence available suggesting a possible @entity73 link			1
@entity74 : @entity13 ' certainly ' misled on @entity22 , but unsure of motive @entity7 feel that the administration misled the @entity10 people before the presidential election , won by @entity15 , because an @entity73 attack countered the narrative that @entity15 's policies , in @entity13 's words , had " decimated " @entity73			1
for @entity7 critics , @entity13 illustrates their problems with how the @entity15 administration has responded to the @entity22 attack and its fallout			1
q : what are @entity7 problems with her possible nomination as secretary of state ? a : most opposition to @entity13 as a candidate to replace @entity96 centers around her role in the @entity22 affair			1
sen. @entity99 , who has been supportive of @entity15 's nominees for the @entity101 , says he does not feel comfortable with someone who , in his view , was involved in using misinformation as a cabinet - level official			0
other republicans argue that @entity13 is not independent enough to be @entity10 's top diplomat			1
they see her as someone who blindly follows @entity15 and puts politics over national security			0
in a dig at @entity13 , sen. @entity114 , who is on the @entity115 , said @entity13 would be a better fit for chairman of the @entity118 than secretary of state			1
could the @entity7 block @entity13 for secretary of state ? @entity13 is not without her supporters , however			1
in addition to staunch backing among @entity130 , sen. @entity124 , a @entity125 and chairman of the @entity127 , met with @entity13 and said he was satisfied with her answers			0
" based on her public record and her public service , i would not feel that her appearances and anything she said on those sunday morning talk shows september 16th would disqualify her for appointment to any other office , " @entity124 said			0
but @entity13 's biggest champion is @entity15			0
during a news conference earlier this month , he said : " @entity1 , she has done exemplary work			0
she has represented the @entity10 and our interests in the @entity2 with skill , and professionalism , and toughness , and grace			0
" @entity13 fails to subdue @entity7 ' criticism over @entity11 attack q : how much of the @entity7 's questioning of @entity13 is politically motivated ? a : to some extent , the harsh treatment of @entity13 is motivated by politics			1
@entity7 believe the president 's handling of the aftermath of the @entity22 attack shows a lack of leadership and tried to make that a campaign issue			2
ironically , some are frustrated that @entity15 's challenger , @entity165 , did not take enough advantage of this in the presidential campaign			0
senate majority leader @entity169 this week called the attacks on @entity13 " outrageous , utterly unmoored from facts and reality			0
" in a statement , @entity169 said , " the election is over			0
it is time to drop these partisan political games , and focus our attention on the real challenges facing us as a nation			0
" q : are there other issues besides political ones ? a : for some senators like @entity187 , this is personal			2
@entity12 was a good friend of @entity187 , which is why he is working hard to avenge his death			2
others have voiced questions about whether @entity13 is the best choice for the job -- she is a tough talker who some might see as too blunt to be secretary of state			2
however , most @entity7 senators have generally had positive remarks about her record as @entity2 ambassador and said their criticism centers around her role in the @entity22 affair			1
q : are there others they would rather see @entity15 nominate to replace @entity96 ? a : @entity187 and several other senators have said that sen. @entity211 , @entity212 , would make an excellent choice			2
@entity211 is another top contender for the position who has made no secret of the fact he would like the job			0
after meeting with @entity13 on wednesday , @entity7 sen. @entity220 of @entity221 said , " i think @entity211 would be an excellent appointment and would be easily confirmed by his colleagues			2
" some political experts speculate that part of the enthusiasm for @entity211 could be that his departure would trigger a special election in @entity212 , where recently defeated @entity7 @entity229 could run again and give the @entity7 another seat in the @entity37			2
@entity231 leaves @entity13 meeting with questions ; says @entity211 would be confirmed easily			0

@entity13 is focal point in @entity22 response ; @entity7 feels she misled @entity10 in comments
some republicans do *n't* think @entity13 is independent enough to be secretary of state
for @entity187 , the fight over a possible @entity13 nomination may be personal
@entity13 has supporters in @entity247 ; most @entity7 senators give her good marks
