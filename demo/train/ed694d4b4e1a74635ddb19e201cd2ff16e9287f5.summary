-- @entity1 ought to be held indoors -- and that means all of them			1
the game of football should be played in any kind of conditions , anytime , anyplace -- day , night , indoors , outdoors , weekends , weeknights , whatever			1
to ensure pristine conditions for the most popular yearly event in all of @entity16 sport , the @entity12 needs to book each of its @entity1 contests in a stadium covered by ( a ) a permanent dome or ( @entity20 ) a retractable roof			1
@entity23 is scheduled to be played this coming sunday in an outdoor arena in northern @entity25			1
a game featuring some of the @entity12 's greatest stars could result in hundreds of millions of tv viewers watching these poor dudes slip , slide and shiver their xl - sized butts off			1
the defending @entity12 champion @entity37 ' quarterback , @entity35 , put it bluntly in 2013 when asked about holding 2014 's @entity1 outdoors in february in the @entity39 / @entity25 region : " i think it 's stupid			1
if you want a @entity1 , put a retractable dome on your stadium			1
then you can get one			0
" @entity35 took flak for that			0
he also had to issue an apology for describing an outdoor @entity1 on the @entity47 as " retarded , " but the opinion he was tossing out was right on the money			1
what a shame to risk ruining the biggest game of the year			1
no other major @entity16 sport -- not baseball , basketball or hockey -- holds its championship fight at a neutral site			1
those sports are forced take whatever comes -- if it 's rainy in @entity61 or frigid in @entity62 or wherever , hey , tough luck			2
that 's the way the @entity66 ball bounces			0
@entity67 , however , has the ability to work around this			0
it is n't like basketball or hockey , where the team with the best record gets the home - stadium advantage			0
the @entity12 selects its @entity1 sites several years in advance			1
well , it selected @entity39 / @entity25 for this one and good luck with that , guys			1
when this game is over , instead of @entity82 , douse the winning coach with a cooler of hot chicken soup			2
peculiar how it 's @entity86 who must quarterback his team ( the @entity87 ) in what could be some truly unpleasant @entity1 weather			1
february 4 , 2007 : for the first time , @entity86 took his team ( then the @entity91 ) to a @entity1 , where everyone would get to see what a skillful , pinpoint passer he was			1
oh , and the opponents , the @entity95 , had a high - flying offense of their own , scoring the second-most points of any @entity12 team that season			0
what a game this would be ! there in tropical @entity104 -- where it rained and rained and rained			2
the game was a joke			2
the wet ball squirted out of players ' hands			0
guys slipped as if on banana peels			0
a great kicker missed an easy field goal			0
a holder fumbled the snap on an extra point			0
during one slapstick sequence , a @entity120 fumbled the kickoff , then a @entity123 fumbled on the next play			0
@entity104 has been host to many a @entity1			2
it is generally warm there in january and a good time is had by all			0
but that @entity1 of 2007 was n't a game -- it was a monsoon			1
it put its players , coaches , referees and , worst of all , its paying spectators through four hours of misery and mess			0
at halftime , even the singer @entity138 had to sing " @entity141 " in the rain			2
with a $ 1,200 face value on a ticket now , is this what the @entity12 wants its fans to endure in years to come ? the possibility of going to a championship game and coming home with the flu ? or the possibility of a final score of @entity152 3 , @entity87 0 in a blizzard ? @entity154 -- that 's 50 , for all you roman numeral haters -- is booked for 2016 for a field that is n't even operational yet : @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160 , the future home of the @entity161			1
it will undoubtedly be a beautiful place			0
but it wo n't have a roof			0
@entity160 is having a drought , and it 's not exactly an @entity167 rain forest up there			2
but if that @entity1 l game ends up being played in a torrential downpour , do n't say we did n't warn you			1
at this time , @entity12 teams that have a stadium with a roof are the @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 ( domed ) and the @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity91 ( retractable )			2
@entity182 will host the 2015 game , @entity181 the one in 2017			0
beyond that , we shall see			0
a lot of serious thought should be given to making sure that every @entity1 is played in optimal conditions , so that the players themselves decide the outcome , not the cold , rain or snow			1
@entity193 and @entity160 and other nice places want the game -- of course they do			2
who would n't ? but they can not make a promise on @entity202 's behalf			0
they can merely cross their fingers and hope			0
as for the @entity39 and @entity25 area being host to a game like this in february , wow , whose stupid idea was this ? @entity39 and @entity25 have some of the smartest , most loyal football fans in the world			1
let them watch @entity215 and @entity217 games in their stadium week after week in all kinds of weather and all kinds of clothes			0
then tell them to please be sure to watch the @entity1 every year -- on tv			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity227 : football gets to choose where its championship game is played
why risk playing in @entity25 where rain , snow or cold could *interfere* ?
@entity227 : hold @entity1 in stadiums with domes or retractable roofs
he says @entity242 fans should watch the @entity1 -- on tv
