@entity0 , @entity1 -- dr. @entity3 ca n't even count the number of women who 've complained to her about how tough it is to make the decision about hormone replacement therapy			1
a 2002 study found @entity10 made women more vulnerable to health problems including heart attacks and strokes			1
" women say , ' oh it used to be so simple			2
now it 's so complex , ' " says @entity3 , a cardiologist and former director of the @entity18			2
" and i tell them , ' yes , it used to be so simple because it was wrong			2
' " this is what she means : before 2002 , it was practically standard operating procedure to put women on synthetic hormones as soon as they reached menopause			1
( " we were putting them in the drinking water , " jokes @entity3			2
but that turned out to be not such a great idea			2
a study in 2002 found that hormone replacement therapy , or @entity10 , made women more vulnerable to heart attacks , strokes , breast cancer and blood clots			1
in droves , doctors yanked their patients off the hormones			2
six years later , @entity3 and others are pleading for a middle ground -- a world where doctors do n't paint women with a broad brush , but instead consider the medical needs of each individual woman			2
the stumbling block to this middle ground is that patients often do n't know what are good ( and bad ) reasons to go on @entity10			1
and it 's not just the patients who do n't know			2
" a lot of the doctors are confused as well , " says dr. @entity59 , executive director of the @entity60 and a consultant in obstetrics and gynecology at the @entity64			2
but there 's some good news in this hormonal mess			0
since 2002 , a consensus has developed among the experts about legitimate and not - so - legitimate reasons for considering @entity10			1
here are the big five legitimate reasons : 1			0
hot flashes if you have severe hot flashes , you 're a good candidate for hormones , our experts say			1
" they alleviate the problem by about 95 percent , " @entity59 says			1
many women -- probably about two - thirds -- have mild to moderate hot flashes and wo n't need hormones , he adds			1
" generally speaking , they can get away with layering clothing , avoiding spicy foods , breathing techniques or yoga			0
night sweats " night sweats are hot flashes when you 're under blankets , so you ca n't get rid of the heat easily , " @entity59 says			1
if night sweats are making you lose sleep to the point you 're dysfunctional the next day , hormones might be a good option			0
" some women say , ' i ca n't live my life like this			0
' that 's the woman who should not be denied the hormones , " says @entity103 , professor of medicine at the @entity105			0
@entity103 is co-author of a new study in the @entity110 showing that women who took a type of @entity10 called combined therapy ( estrogen and progestin together ) had a higher risk for breast cancer even three years after they quit taking the hormones			1
sleeplessness the onset of menopause often gives women sleepless nights -- sometimes because of the night sweats , sometimes because of hormone changes			1
@entity10 sometimes helps , @entity3 says			1
osteoporosis -- sometimes studies have shown that @entity10 can cut down on bone fractures for women with osteoporosis , but it 's not for everyone			1
" a younger woman in early menopause who has osteoporosis -- or risk factors for osteoporosis -- might benefit from @entity10 , " @entity59 says			1
" older women should use something else			0
" ( see page 14 of this @entity18 report for other ways to treat osteoporosis			0
) women are at high risk for osteoporosis if they 're thin , have a family history of osteoporosis , are lactose intolerant or smoke			0
you feel better on hormones " that 's absolutely a legitimate reason for taking hormones , " @entity3 says			0
" you very often ca n't measure what makes a woman feel better			0
but just because you ca n't measure it does n't mean it 's not real			0
" it 's important , however , that women who go on hormones for this reason -- or any reason -- understand the risks of hormones			1
" i tell women , ' i 'll give you the prescription as long as you understand the risks and the responsibilities and come in for regular checkups to see to it that all is going well , ' " @entity59 says			1
and what are some not - so - good reasons for going on @entity10 pills ? vaginal dryness and itchiness are better treated with estrogen creams , our experts say			1
irregular periods should be tolerated , or treated with birth control pills , @entity59 says			2
and certainly do n't go on @entity10 because you think it might prevent aging , heart disease or cancer			1
the @entity18 study in 2002 rejected those reasons			1
if you do decide to go on @entity10 , you need to keep several things in mind			1
first , take the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time			0
that second part is pretty fuzzy			0
" the jury is still out			0
is short - term two to three years ? five years ? " @entity103 says			0
" when you go back to your doctor for checkups , ask , ' should i go off it now ? ' " another question for your doctor : whether you should go on estrogen alone or combination therapy ( estrogen plus progestin )			1
each has its pluses and minuses -- see @entity208 of the @entity18 document			0
choosing the right doctor is obviously of the utmost importance			0
@entity59 recommends an obstetrician - gynecologist rather than an internist			0
he recommends asking doctors how often they deal with hormone issues			2
" some obstetricians are so busy delivering babies , they wo n't be spending much time on hormones , " he says			0
