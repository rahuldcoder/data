-- congressional auditors have uncovered widespread abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline special - education students in @entity7 schools , with some deaths linked to the practices , a top congressman says			1
investigators in @entity11 say a teacher left @entity13 in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours			1
the findings are among those expected from a @entity19 report scheduled to be released tuesday			1
the report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools , including cases of children being held face - down on the ground			1
the @entity19 report was prepared for the @entity31 and @entity30 , which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special - needs students			1
" i think what we 're going to hear from the @entity19 is that very often , special - need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances , " said rep. @entity36 , @entity37 , the committee 's chairman			1
in other cases , children as young as 6 have been locked away " for hours at a time , " @entity36 said			1
" what the @entity19 is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread , " he said			1
" the state regulations about how to handle these incidents do n't exist in about half the states , and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations			1
" the @entity19 , the investigative arm of @entity62 , found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having " special needs " -- conditions including autism and @entity69 -- are patchy at best			1
teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods , and in some cases , where improper restraints led to injuries , teachers often kept their jobs			2
only five states keep track of incidents where special - needs students are separated or restrained			1
parents contacted by @entity0 commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school			2
when confronted with complaints , school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations , even after public investigations found the charges to be true			0
and parents told @entity0 that when they got into a dispute with the teacher , their child was made to suffer as retribution			0
some of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms			0
experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others			1
but @entity0 found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions			0
state investigators in @entity11 found a teacher left 7 - year - old @entity13 in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to " shut up			1
" while the boy was in the cubicle , the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing			1
his parents , @entity121 and @entity122 , said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes , and they believe that after the first few minutes , he had no idea why he was in the cubicle			1
" it was so sad			0
we felt it was a form of torture for him but he , being autistic , he had no way to express it , " @entity128 said			0
" he could n't tell			0
" and @entity122 said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself			1
when she came to school to pick him up , " he was covered in marker -- on his eyelids , on his hair , face , clothes , arms , eyelids -- everywhere			0
" " i started thinking , ' what was he thinking ? ' was he thinking , ' why is my mom letting this person do this to me ? why am i here ? i trust no one now			0
' " in @entity13 's case , like others cited by the @entity19 , the teacher remains on the job			1
and what frustrates experts is that efforts to force unruly children to comply do n't actually work			2
at one school in @entity162 , however , teachers appear to have better results using sharply different methods			0
the @entity165 at @entity166 serves severely emotionally disturbed children that have been passed from school to school , and even from juvenile justice centers			2
when school director @entity171 came to @entity172 in 1999 , the school had documented more than 1,000 cases of restraint and seclusion that year			0
after the school revamped its approach , no such incidents were reported			2
when they get to @entity172 , students can be violent and aggressive			0
but instead of trying to force a change in behavior , the school teaches the children new skills to get what they need			2
children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways			2
children who need to move frequently -- a common trait with conditions such as autism -- are permitted to do so , then re-directed to the task at hand			1
staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children , parents or other teachers , even among themselves			2
and when a child acts violently , the staff is trained to step aside , rather than immediately attempt a potentially dangerous restraint			0
on a recent visit to the school , all students appeared to be calm and receptive to teachers			0
the school 's philosophy can be summed up in a question @entity171 likes to ask teachers interviewing for jobs there : which teacher you remember most from your own childhood ? " no one ever mentions the person who yelled at them , who screamed at them , who told them to write a phrase a hundred times , who slammed them into closets , who was abrupt , who made them feel stupid			0
no one ever mentions those people , " said @entity171			0
" our job is to teach			0
sometimes the children we are teaching here present extraordinary challenges ; it can be very , very difficult			2
but that 's the job we chose to do			0
