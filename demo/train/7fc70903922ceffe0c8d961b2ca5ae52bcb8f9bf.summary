you 've heard of crowdfunding -- raising funds through donations on the internet -- well , get ready for " like " funding			0
an enterprising new startup in @entity7 has devised a way of harnessing @entity13 " likes " as a way of getting valuable donations to worthy causes and , at the same time , boosting the corporate social responsibility profile of the companies that provide the cash			1
called @entity17 , the small team in @entity7 's @entity19 district -- the city 's answer to @entity22 -- works to bring good stories and brands together			0
co-founder @entity25 -- a former actuary with a major bank -- left her job to devise a system that would benefit charities , creative projects and social enterprise projects			1
" we want to rally supporters to share interesting stories on creative projects that carry a sponsor 's logo			1
through this sharing we can generate a measurable media exposure for corporate sponsors , " @entity37 said , adding that sponsors get their corporate logo embedded with the story which appears whenever the project is ' liked ' or shared			1
" we know creative projects have the capacity to go viral -- just look at the potato salad project			1
we want to devise a system that allows people with these kind of projects to monetize their media exposure , " she added			2
with corporations donating a purse of a maximum of between $ 1,500 and $ 2,000 , internet users can choose from a menu of projects to " like			1
" each " like " will typically give the project around $ hk2 and each " like " will carry the backer 's brand logo			1
" what we do is match - make creative projects with corporates , " explained @entity37			1
" we have a database of different projects currently from @entity7 and then we have contact with the corporate sponsors			2
" after we match - make them based on their corporate social responsibility objectives , we provide a web link for the creative projects , which is for their supporters to share the story with a different @entity13 circle			1
" using a simple embeddable button on the project , all supporters have to do is click the button to make a mini-donation			2
the business model for @entity83 is similar to crowdfunding models where the company takes 10 % of the successful funds raised			1
for a company that only filed its invention patent five months ago and had a beta - launch in august , it already has more than a few successes under its belt			0
one in particular was a @entity7 school principal who quit his job to start a charity organization to provide free tutorials to underprivileged children			0
" in a matter of just six hours , he generated 5,000 ' likes ' and 8,000 shares , " @entity37 said			2
" the result was quite impressive because the media exposure that project created was probably worth more than the exposure he got through @entity7 's mainstream press			0
" other projects include work with abandoned animals and medical projects in @entity111			0
" the ultimate objective is to make it like an advertising platform -- corporates can come to us , find the projects they want and at the same time their investment can be supporting interesting initiatives , " she said			0
good stories , she says , have the capacity to go viral and can be worth more to corporations than the equivalent in advertising			0
while there is a cap on the corporate donation so that a compelling and viral story does not sink its benefactor with @entity13 " likes , " @entity37 said that a donation of around $ 2,000 can make a big difference to a small charity			1
as for @entity83 , the company is looking to break even after next year			2
@entity37 said that while many startups founder within a year , she has high hopes for the group she helped to set up			0
more than anything , she said , a startup needs money and it needs publicity when it starts out			2
she believes the @entity83 model has the capacity to deliver both			2
meanwhile , its most difficult task at the moment is educating a skeptical industry			0
digital media specialist @entity153 said the model was , as yet , largely untested			0
" i 'm really not sure if people are prepared to have sponsors ride their posts in exchange for funding a project			0
i guess if it 's a cause that you believe in , why not , " he said			0
for @entity37 , however , the whole thrust of @entity83 is getting corporates to put their money where their @entity13 " likes " are			1
" it takes a lot of perseverance to get corporations to invest in this type of creative project -- it 'll at least take a year to educate them , " @entity37 said , adding that the group have now set their sites on @entity111 as its next frontier and is already investigating a tie - up with the mainland digital giant @entity171			1
