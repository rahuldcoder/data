-- on january 12 , a magnitude - 7.0 quake struck @entity2 just southwest of the capital , @entity4			0
on february 27 , an 8.8 - magnitude quake hit @entity6 near that nation 's second largest city , @entity9			0
that same day there was a 7.0 quake off the coast of @entity13 , @entity14 , and just this week a 6.4 quake hit southern @entity16			0
the @entity17 looked at whether all of the seismic activity could be related			2
fact check : is there any connection between the recent deadly earthquakes ? dr. @entity24 of the @entity25 , who specializes in active tectonics , says that earthquakes are sporadic and unpredictable in nature			1
according to @entity24 , the fact that these relatively strong quakes would strike around the same time is merely coincidence			1
because the quakes did happen one after another , earthquakes are on people 's mind , @entity24 explained			1
" had the quakes in @entity2 and @entity6 not occurred recently , we might not have even been interested in the other quakes , " he said			2
@entity0 meteorologist @entity42 said earthquakes can trigger other seismic activity , but added that those four aforementioned events were too far apart in both time and distance to be connected			1
the @entity48 on its web site takes on the assertion that two major earthquakes in the same day must be related			0
their answer : not likely			0
this is because @entity56 's surface is not rigid enough to transfer the stress over long distances			0
" there is evidence to suggest that earthquakes in one area can trigger seismic activity within a few hundred miles , " they write			1
" there is also evidence that some major earthquakes manage to trigger seismicity over much greater distances ( thousands of miles ) , but these triggered quakes are small and very short lived			1
" the @entity48 estimates there are several million earthquakes each year and the @entity75 locates about 50 quakes per day			2
however , large quakes measuring 8.0 and higher occur only about once a year on average			0
bottom line : while earthquakes can , and do , trigger other seismic events , the recent earthquakes in @entity2 , @entity6 , @entity14 and @entity16 are not thought by experts to be connected			1

fact check : is there any connection between the recent deadly earthquakes ?
earthquakes are sporadic , unpredictable in nature , says @entity25 expert
@entity0 meteorologist : great time *intervals* , distances indicate quakes are *n't* connected
while quakes often trigger other seismic events , recent events are thought to be *unrelated*
