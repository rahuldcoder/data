-- as video game technology improves , games are getting quicker , deadlier and more reactive			2
this , in some cases , is requiring gamers to be faster on the draw , more reflexive in their actions and to be able to act with little time for a thought - out strategy			2
one gaming genre , however , prefers to slow things down while still maintaining a high degree of action and planning			2
turn - based strategy games harken back to the days of playing board games with dice and individualized pieces			1
but , now , they can use the latest tech to help make the games more immersive and interactive			2
at @entity24 near @entity25 , the company continues to create one of the best turn - based strategy franchises with its " civilization " series			1
@entity30 , director of creative development , has spearheaded development of the " @entity33 " series since 1991 , but he helped found @entity24 with the idea of bringing in others who thrive on the thrill of strategy and creating experiences that test the mind of the gamer			1
" i think it is unique to strategy games , " he said			1
" i know people have said , ' i 've looked at @entity33 and it looked complicated so i did n't play it			2
' where a strategy gamer will look at it and say , ' oooh			2
i 'm going to play that			0
' " 10 - year - long video game creates ' hellish nightmare ' world strategy board games back in the 1970s and ' 80s , like " @entity54 " and " war in @entity56 , " were simulation - type games requiring players to spend a lot of time rolling dice to resolve combat or find out different game stats -- weather conditions , civil unrest , troop rally points			1
bringing turn - based strategy games to computers allowed all that number crunching to be done quickly and increased the pace of the game			1
@entity71 , lead designer for " @entity72 : @entity77 , " designs historical board games in his spare time , but appreciates how turn - based strategy games now create a better experience for the player			1
" if the player is just rolling dice to update status and once every 20 minutes he gets to make a decision , that 's horrible , " @entity71 said			2
" back then , it was kind of cool to see how the simulation worked , but now they want to feel engaged like they are @entity86			0
the bar has raised a lot in what they are expecting			0
" 5 games to watch from @entity92 technology has elevated the expectations of players for graphics and artificial intelligence , and made some strategy board game mechanics easier to implement			1
@entity30 said there are many concepts that work really well in a computer game , like fog of war -- not being able to see all the pieces on the board until your units are within range of enemy units			0
" there is just as much temptation to do too much with the computer game ... , " he said			0
" you have to make sure the player feels they 're in control and everything is understandable			0
" part of the excitement for designers has been figuring out the best way to create the game experience so that it becomes part of the natural flow of the action			0
it is also a challenge not to get lost in the glow of creating a really cool weather system , for example , that the player is n't even going to notice , much less enjoy			0
" certainly , it is a place where i 've gotten stuck a few times , thinking about things in terms of how the systems work together instead of thinking , does this even ... matter to the player ? " @entity139 , lead designer for " @entity140 : enemy unknown , " said			1
" in a strategy game , you have an idea of a player experience in your mind			0
tweaking these systems , it 's hard to gauge how that 's going to achieve the ideal player experience			0
" @entity30 , @entity139 and @entity151 all said they have a passion for the genre and try to create games they would want to play themselves			0
despite all the system creations , which they feel are unique to the turn - based genre because of the intricate details demanded by fans , the core goal of any game has to be fun			1
@entity30 said there is no checklist they work from to make their games			0
he said they have also been fortunate to have an involved and vocal fan base for their strategy games , which helps them fine tune their creations to meet the demands of their fans			1
@entity71 points out the future of turn - based strategy gaming is already playing out in other casual games like " @entity181 , " where players take turns playing a " @entity184 " - like game with opponents			1
while watching his daughter play on her phone with her friends , he realized casual gaming is creating a growing audience for the turn - based strategy genre			1
is ' @entity193 ' a broken game or just too hard ? " it is amazing just the connectiveness of everything now , " he said			0
" there are absolutely opportunities for strategy games to interact in all new ways and opening up new modes of multiplayer action			1
" and while the crew at @entity24 is busy working on the next computer strategy game , traditional board strategy games have been making a revival as well			1
" @entity213 , " a game first published in 1995 , has been reappearing on store shelves , and made appearances on the popular @entity211 sitcom , " @entity212			0
" other titles requiring more thought than reflex actions are also drawing interest from gamers , both longtime and casual players			0
@entity221 ! @entity222 marks 40 years of gaming " there is such a huge audience now for that style of interaction ( with turn - based strategy games ) , " @entity71 said			1
" it is really an interesting phenomenon			0
" " the world is changing , but it 's all good for strategy gamers			2
