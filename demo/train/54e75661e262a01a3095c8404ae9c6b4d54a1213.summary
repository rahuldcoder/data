starting on @entity3 , more than 1 billion @entity0 around the world will enter the season of @entity5 , a time of solemn spiritual preparation for @entity7 , the culmination of the church 's calendar			1
despite its ancient history ( @entity5 became standardized in the @entity13 around the year 325 ) myths about @entity5 traditions abound			1
here are five of the most common , as well as one fact that may surprise you			0
myth 1 : @entity5 is 40 days counting from @entity3 to holy saturday , there are 46 days			1
then why do we always refer to the 40 days of @entity5 ? the 40 days of fasting during @entity5 do not include sundays			1
every sunday @entity0 commemorate the day of @entity21 's resurrection , thus , sunday by its nature is a day of joy and celebration			1
the sundays during @entity5 are not prescribed days of fasting and abstinence , so meat is permitted			1
myth 2 : @entity5 ends on @entity30 @entity5 ends on holy thursday			1
the season of @entity5 begins on @entity3 , february 18 this year , and ends on holy thursday , april 2 , which commemorates @entity21 ' last supper with his disciples			1
as stated in the @entity13 's " general norms for the @entity38 and the calendar , " the @entity35 ( @entity36 for " three days " ) begins with the evening @entity40 , and includes @entity41 and holy saturday			0
it closes with evening prayer on @entity30			0
myth 3 : @entity13 abstain from meat during @entity5 only on fridays during @entity5 are @entity13 required to abstain from meat in remembrance of the sacrifice @entity21 made on @entity41			2
according to abstinence laws , meat includes warm - blooded animals and birds			0
fish and other cold - blooded animals are not prohibited			0
local catholic bishops may determine specific prescripts about what foods are included in abstinence			0
this can lead to interesting exceptions			0
for instance , in the @entity64 of @entity65 , eating muskrat is allowable on fridays during @entity5			2
@entity67 , beaver and alligator are permissible in some places , too -- provided your local butcher has good connections ! myth 4 : the @entity74 decides the date of @entity7 thanks in part to astronomers who figured out when all full moons would occur , for nearly 1,700 years @entity7 has fallen on the first sunday after the @entity79 , or @entity80 , full moon			2
the earliest possible date of @entity7 is march 22 , and the latest is april 25.this year @entity7 is on april 5			2
the way to calculate the date of @entity7 was determined at a meeting of church bishops and others called the @entity87 in 325 near @entity88 in what is now modern day @entity90			1
myth 5 : @entity21 went into the desert for 40 days before he was put to death actually , @entity21 spent 40 days in the desert before beginning his public ministry , several years before he was crucified			0
the @entity95 of @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 -- individual , yet similar , interpretations of @entity21 's message -- each tell of @entity21 spending 40 days in the desert , where he fasted , prayed and was tempted by the devil			0
after this he went to @entity106 where he called his first disciples and began his public ministry			0
the 40 days of @entity5 are a time to remember and imitate the life and ministry of @entity21 as @entity0 prepare to commemorate his death and resurrection at @entity7			1
fact : since 1975 , @entity116 catholics have donated $ 250 million during @entity5 to feed the hungry around the world @entity120 's @entity119 project began in @entity121 , @entity122 , 40 years ago , when @entity116 began to take up a collection to help a famine in @entity125			2
more than 13,000 faith communities participated in @entity127 last @entity5 .			0

despite its ancient history , myths about @entity5 abound
starting on @entity3 , more than 1 billion @entity0 will enter the solemn church season in preparation for @entity7
