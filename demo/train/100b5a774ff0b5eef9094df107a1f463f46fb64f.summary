-- and so the carnival carries on			0
@entity2 , the team which manages to thrill and frustrate almost simultaneously , clinched its place in the quarterfinal of the @entity6 following a tension - fueled encounter with @entity9			1
a 3 - 2 victory on penalties following a 1 - 1 draw in @entity13 means @entity16 's side 's quest to win the @entity6 on home soil remains alive			1
it will now turn its attention to a last eight contest with @entity21 -- a team which has thrilled so far in this tournament			0
while @entity2 will take the plaudits , @entity9 should be commended for a performance which at times defied the ability of the human body to run and hustle as its players did			1
having already scored an own - goal to gift @entity2 a 19th minute lead , @entity30 was to be the fall guy at the death			1
with @entity2 leading the shootout 3 - 2 , @entity30 needed to score to keep his country in the tournament			1
as he stood , eyes firmly on the goal , two nations held their breath -- but only one broke out into ecstasy as the ball smashed against the post and rolled away to safety			2
as those in red flopped to the ground , their bodies bruised and beaten , tears running down their faces , their opponents danced their way around the field , perhaps more out of relief than happiness			0
@entity2 , still haunted by its failure 64 years ago when it was beaten by @entity59 in the 1950 final , can not afford anything but triumph			1
it will now move on to face @entity21 in @entity63 on friday -- but there will still be some concerns over @entity2 's performance			1
this was not the showing of a side which appeared ready to become @entity6 champion			0
poor in possession , unnerving in defense , most of those at the @entity73 were put through a painstaking afternoon as its side seldom showed what has become expected of a @entity79 side			0
and yet , before kickoff , every single historic fact pointed towards a @entity2 victory			1
@entity2 , which had not lost a competitive home game since 1975 , has dominated encounters between the two sides in recent years			1
on the 26 occasions @entity9 had ventured onto @entity79 turf to face the host nation , it had lost 20 and drawn six -- not a record to inspire confidence ahead of a last - 16 clash			1
add to that @entity2 's victory over @entity9 in @entity97 four years ago and it 's easy to understand why @entity16 's men headed into the contest as the favorite			1
but this @entity9 side , coached by the irrepressible @entity99 , appears to have little interest in history			1
its victory over world champion @entity104 during the group stage gave a glimpse of the talent within the squad and led by the prolific @entity110 , it soon gave notice that it was not about to allow @entity2 to simply swat it aside			1
even when it fell behind , @entity30 , inadvertently directing @entity113 's header into his own net off eventual goalscorer @entity115 , @entity9 refused to buckle			1
playing with an energy and intensity which belied the energy sapping conditions , the visiting side soon crafted an equalizer , which perhaps owed more to @entity2 's poor defending than any @entity123 magic			1
a careless pass allowed @entity9 to pick up possession and @entity110 weaved his way into the penalty area before carefully placing the ball beyond the outstretched arm of @entity130			1
the @entity132 forward , who has scored 10 goals in his past 14 international games , has been his side 's talisman throughout the tournament -- and his pace , power and trickery continued to cause @entity2 problems			1
but where @entity110 managed to shine , @entity142 , the man who had lit up this @entity6 , failed to find his way into the contest			2
the 22 - year - old , who had scored four goals in his opening three games , received a kick in the first half which appeared to leave him struggling			2
but @entity2 's golden boy , even when not fully fit , still managed to cause problems and his header from an @entity153 cross flew narrowly wide as the host nation threatened			2
minutes later , @entity142 was at it again -- this time leaving the @entity123 defense for dead only for the much maligned @entity156 to lash the ball harmlessly over the crossbar			0
after a fierce and frantic first half , both teams emerged in more cautious manner following the interval			0
@entity9 , so disciplined in defense and careful in possession , appeared to be the calmer of the two as nerves began to creep into @entity2 's game			1
and yet , for all of @entity2 's inability to keep the ball , it still looked the more threatening			2
as those draped in yellow packed inside the @entity73 began to raise their voices , its players began to respond			0
but instead of the goal it so badly craved , @entity2 could only find frustration			1
@entity176 , the man with a comic book hero 's name but with the first touch of a dastardly villain , thought he had found a way through			0
the forward took @entity185 's long ball on his chest but the ball appeared to roll down his arm before he fired the ball past @entity190			0
as the @entity79 around the world rejoiced , the whistle of @entity193 referee @entity192 could scarcely be heard			0
first , there was disbelief			0
@entity192 's call looked to have taken the wind out of @entity2 's sails -- and it could have been heading out of the tournament but for a wonderful save by @entity130			2
@entity203 made his way down the right and his cross picked out the tireless @entity207 , whose effort was brilliantly parried by the @entity79 goalkeeper			0
with both sets of players appearing to settle for extra-time , chances were at a premium , although @entity190 denied both @entity142 and @entity176 as the clock ticked down			0
extra time became a war of attrition with both sides guilty of giving the ball away and both sets of players desperate not to lose rather than being desperate to win			0
and yet , with a minute of extra time remaining , @entity9 came within millimeters of dumping @entity2 out of the @entity6			1
@entity224 , a substitute , received the ball just outside the penalty area before swiveling sharply and smashing an audacious effort against the crossbar			0
" that near goal right at the end has been really hard for us , " @entity9 coach @entity99 told reporters			1
" if we had scored , we would have made history for ever			0
it would have been the ' @entity234 '			0
" with the crossbar still shaking , both sets of players were left to confront the dreaded scenario of penalty kicks			0
@entity115 was the first man to step up -- showing no sign of being overawed by the occasion and coolly firing the ball past @entity190			2
then it was left to @entity130 to steal the show as he denied @entity224 and @entity110 with two fine saves			2
@entity2 appeared to be coasting but there was still a twist in the tale as @entity249 and then hulk both failed and @entity207 and @entity251 brought @entity9 level			1
@entity142 then showed nerves of steel to put @entity2 back in front before @entity30 struck his effort against the inside of the post			2
@entity259 stepped @entity30 -- the weight of a nation upon his shoulders and a sea of yellow shirts which would drown him given the chance			0
the defender stepped up and struck his kick to the goalkeeper 's left only for the ball to hit the inside of the post and roll away to safety			0
first , there was silence			0
then came the roar -- the outpouring of relief			0
then the singing , the dancing , the realization that @entity2 's dream remains alive			2
while @entity9 's players fell to the ground inconsolable with grief , @entity2 's ran into each others arms and celebrated			1
lucky ? fortuitous ? nobody wearing yellow will care			0
