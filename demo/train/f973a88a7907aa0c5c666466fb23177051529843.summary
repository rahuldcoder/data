" i said now it 's time for me to do something different			0

the first section contains stories about bribes that were paid , breaking down the numbers by region and government department			1
the second collects stories from people who refused to pay a bribe , while the third contains stories of honesty , where citizens were not asked to pay a public official			1
until now , @entity19 's site has hosted nearly 600 cases of , mainly petty , bribery worth around 17 million @entity3 shillings ( Â £ 204,000 )			0
" corruption is a huge issue : it 's so endemic and the worst part about it is it becomes a way of life , " says @entity19 , who 's also about to roll out an sms service that will allow citizens to report their stories instantaneously via their mobile phones			1
" so what i 'm trying to do with the site essentially is to get people to create a network of anti-corruption people -- people who feel that this has to come to an end and we need to make a difference			0

" back in @entity3 , @entity19 is optimistic that the use of technology can help things change			2
" @entity3 are tired , " he says			0
" we need a new generation of @entity3 who are actually positive , hard - working , people who do n't want to get a short - term gain , people who are actually thinking the only way to make a difference in our country is for people to say no to corruption			2
