-- for nine years , " csi " star @entity1 has had it all			1
and that was exactly the problem			0
@entity1 says he 's become " too comfortable " at " csi , " and that it 's time to go			1
" the reason i 'm leaving is because i 'm afraid i 'm becoming too comfortable , " says @entity1			1
" it 's ' csi ' -- they pay me a lot of money , and i do n't have to work very hard anymore			1
i 've got it all figured out			0
and i just realized , @entity14 , as an artist , i 'm going to atrophy			0
you do anything for nine years , it becomes somewhat rote			0
i did n't want to be on the show because they were paying me money and i liked the money			2
i did n't want to be on the show because it saved me from having to go look for other jobs			2
just did n't want it			0
it was too safe for me at this point			0
so i needed to try and break that , and the way to do that , for me , is the theater			0
" so , with his final " csi " episode scheduled to air thursday on @entity35 , @entity1 is saying goodbye to the show that made him very , very famous and very , very rich			1
he 's now living in @entity37 , where he 's resumed a career as a theater actor			2
leaving fame and fortune behind in the name of artistic integrity ? there 's a novel concept for @entity46			2
but still , is n't he just a little sentimental about parting ways with a character that has defined him since 2000 ? " i wo n't miss @entity51 , " says @entity1 matter - of - factly			1
" it was a complete life for me that 's reached its end , and it 's reached it in the right way , i think			2
so i wo n't miss @entity51			0
and i hope that the audience wo n't miss him either			0
" as a producer on the drama since its debut in 2000 and an exec producer since 2004 , @entity1 is one of the highest - paid actors on television ( earning a reported $ 600,000 per episode )			1
over the years , he 's watched his show turn into a ratings powerhouse and -- with syndication and spin - offs -- a veritable billion - dollar industry for @entity35 , which will no doubt feel the pain of @entity1 's departure			1
@entity1 has definitely left his mark on this crime scene			1
from the moment in 1999 when he persuaded creator @entity74 to change @entity76 's last name from @entity77 to @entity51 , to the spring of 2007 when he began to map out his character 's much - anticipated exit , @entity1 has played a significant role in the direction of his hit show			1
" the first day i met @entity1 , before filming the pilot , he said to me he wanted to re-create an ensemble feel of a theater company , to have that type of collaboration , " says executive producer @entity83			1
" it 's not the easiest road to take , to have true collaboration			2
" however , she feels @entity1 's insistence on teamwork " has been an essential element to our success , on every level			1
" @entity1 , who 's unapologetic about his occasional my - way - or - the - highway antics , says he wanted a producer title to ensure that the cast and crew always had an advocate			1
" otherwise , it 's completely unbalanced because everything is tilted toward the network and the studio and the writers			2
it ca n't just be generals			0
you have to have a few lieutenants			0
that 's where i came in			2
" naturally , then , it was @entity1 -- and not producers or the network -- who decided when and where @entity51 would finally step outside the yellow tape			1
" for years , @entity1 had been saying he wanted to go , so we knew that one day he 'd ask to be written out , " says @entity83			1
" we had a game plan for a long time			0
" @entity1 and the writers were set on hammering out an exit strategy that would seem organic to the world of forensic science			1
that 's where the real - life @entity129 came into play			2
" you talk to all of the @entity134 we know , and they all have a short [ career ] life , " says @entity1			1
" they can do this for a while and then they all try to become techs ( advisers ) for our show ! none of them want to go back down an alley and process fingerprints on a garbage can anymore			2
" the long goodbye officially began in november 2007 , when @entity76 's fiancee @entity154 ( @entity155 ) fled @entity156 for destinations unknown , and it continued with the tragic shooting death of @entity159 ( @entity160 ) in october of the following year			2
in fact , @entity1 should have been gone by now : @entity159 's death and @entity51 's swan song were originally scheduled to air by last may , but the 100 - day writers ' strike shortened the season , so there was n't enough time to tell all the stories @entity1 wanted -- including the return of the @entity172 and @entity174 's dominatrix , @entity175			1
postponing his farewell not only put some much - needed space between the high - profile exits of @entity180 and @entity160 , it also gave the show 's creative team plenty of time to find @entity1 's successor			1
after putting out feelers to an impressive roster of stars ( @entity189 and @entity190 were approached ) , the producers set their sights on @entity192 , who has n't starred on tv since playing cowboy @entity194 on " @entity195 " back in the ' 80s			1
while @entity192 is known on screen as a cool character , his first days on set last september -- as research pathologist -- turned - college professor dr. @entity198 -- revealed anxiety underneath that calm demeanor			1
" @entity208 's " @entity202 recalls how the 47 - year - old actor rode his motorcycle to work on the first day and ended up clutching his helmet during a meeting with the writers			0
" he said , ' i 'm just gon na hang on to this because i 'm kind of nervous , " ' she remembers			0
" it was really sweet			0
i think he feels the weight of the challenge of taking over that part			0
i mean , obviously it 's not the same part as @entity76 , but that character was indelible and well - liked -- all that stuff that @entity1 was			1
" adds @entity192 , " @entity1 was the daddy of the whole thing and @entity220 was leaving			1
a lot of people did n't know what to expect			0
" when @entity1 's final day of shooting arrived on october 10 , about 200 members of the show 's cast and crew assembled on the " csi " soundstage to watch his character 's last stroll through the dimly lit lab. though everyone knew that @entity1 was n't gone forever -- he 'll retain his producer title and he 's promised to return for the occasional episode , though that probably wo n't occur until next season -- it did n't make his departure any less significant			1
co-star @entity202 ca n't even think about the " painful " day without tearing up			0
" i could n't stop crying , " she says			0
i 'm having a hard time now , because , you know , we had a great nine years together			0
it 's the end of an era			0
" first things first , though : the man with the beard still has to take his final bow , though nobody 's revealing how			0
but an even bigger cliff - hanger is what will happen to the show after he 's gone			2
" i 'm sick he is leaving , " says one @entity0 poster named @entity258			0
" ' @entity208 ' is @entity76			0
" @entity260 puts it more bluntly : " once @entity51 is gone from the original ' csi , ' so am i. " as he looks forward to the next chapter in his career , @entity1 hopes viewers will adopt his attitude about @entity51 's exit : no tears necessary			1
" i think there 's a way for the audience to remember him , like losing a great co-worker they 've known for years , " says the actor , who has n't ruled out starring in another tv show -- someday			1
" he did n't die in a plane crash , he did n't get a brain tumor			0
