-- there are approximately 600 million @entity3 women in the world , but none will have a direct say in who the next pope will be			1
the 115 cardinals voting for the pope are men			1
one of these men will be chosen to succeed @entity11 , continuing an exclusively male club			1
or is it ? two movies have been made about @entity15 , who , according to legend , was a ninth - century @entity17 who disguised herself under voluminous clerical robes to become a priest , something women are not allowed to be in the @entity21			1
as the story goes , @entity15 outdid all the men in her religious studies and rose in the ranks of the cardinals to become pope			1
she then went into labor during a papal procession and the mob descended on her and her child , ending her reign			0
@entity33 , a theologian and historian from @entity35 , said the story of @entity15 is a myth , nothing but satirical fiction			0
" it keeps appealing to new anxieties and new interests , " he said			0
" so first it 's medieval people who resented the papacy			1
then it 's @entity50 revolutionaries who want to discredit the church			2
" the next constituency is actually @entity21 who want to see women priests			1
and this seems to me the most dangerous aspect of the story , because it 's using a story which is patently nonsense to boost a good cause			2
" but @entity15 still has her believers			0
why , they ask , were cardinals asked to sit on a uniquely shaped chair well into the 16th century ? was it a birthing chair ? or , as legend holds , a specially designed seat for checking the next @entity68 had the right , shall we say , equipment for the job ? what about the peculiarly named @entity74 , or @entity75 , a medieval alleyway shunned by papal processions ? this , according to legend , is where @entity15 came to an end			2
there is even a shrine said to be dedicated to her and her child			0
historians say the road is named not for @entity15 , but for the @entity89 family that lived there			0
still , the legend endures , as do calls for women to break through the stained - glass ceiling and have a greater say in the church			2
at @entity99 's @entity98 , the art on the walls highlights the central role that women have had in the church 's past			1
@entity21 revere @entity106 , the mother of @entity107 , and church history is replete with female saints who struggled and died for the faith			2
others refused to stay silent when they saw evil in the church 's ranks : in the 14th century , @entity115 famously called the cardinals " devils in human form			0
" " everyone would like to have more women everywhere , because this is a fact that is not possible to stop : nowadays , women are very , very strong , " said @entity123 , one of the many women worshiping at the @entity21 of @entity125			0
a bit of female advice might help the church steer its way through troubled waters , said @entity132 , a professor from the @entity133 in @entity99			0
" it certainly brings more balance when you have contact with women and when you listen to women especially and listen to their perspective , " she said			0
" and i think a lot of the ways that this ( abuse ) crisis was handled in the church , to have had more women 's input in dealing with it would have been a better thing			2
" who are the front - runners to replace @entity11 ? sister @entity151 of the @entity152 concedes that the church 's hierarchy is male - dominated , but said women do occupy important lay positions in catholic social and relief organizations			1
" if you take ordination off the table , in the @entity164 our statistics are better than the @entity165 when it comes to women in executive positions , " @entity151 said			1
for now , however , women have at best an indirect influence on the @entity172 's upper echelon			1
" certainly the church is not a democratic society in the way civil society understands , " said cardinal @entity173 of @entity174			0
" it 's a hierarchical church , therefore not everyone is equal			0
" women 's voices might be louder than before , but will there ever be a female pope ? @entity33 said he could see it happening one day			1
" it 's surprising how quickly these things happen once the idea gets around , " he said			0
" but do n't hold your breath			2

the @entity172 's upper echelon appears to be an exclusive men 's club
women are n't allowed to be *ordained* as priests , so they can not become pope
still , many women hold executive lay positions in @entity3 organizations
some believe there was once a female pope ; movies have been made about the medieval tale
