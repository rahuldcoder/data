editor 's note : rep. @entity2 is a @entity3 who represents southwest @entity5			1
before being elected to @entity6 , @entity2 practiced medicine as a cardiothoracic surgeon for 14 years			2
rep. @entity2 says @entity10 ' health care plans do n't focus on quality			1
( @entity12 ) -- @entity13 deserve the best health care system in the world -- one that emphasizes quality , but reduces cost , so all @entity13 can participate			1
as a doctor , i saw firsthand the problems many patients face finding a doctor , navigating the system , and paying their health care bills			2
unfortunately , @entity10 ' plans in @entity6 fail to focus on quality			2
@entity29 @entity28 , @entity30 , recently stated that the @entity10 were proposing " a government - run nightmare operated by federal bureaucrats			2
" if enacted , their plans would complicate the system and take more money from @entity13 pockets -- a nightmare , indeed			1
one report estimates more than 100 million people could drop their current health care coverage if the plans were open to all employers			1
one reason cited for the drop in current coverage -- businesses no longer offering private coverage -- would contradict the president 's promise to allow @entity13 to keep their current coverage , if they like it			1
imposed employer mandates could cost 4.7 million people their jobs			2
all of this means that many people who like their current health insurance might not be able to keep it and be forced into a new system , including a government option with lower reimbursement rates that might discourage their current doctor from continuing to treat them			1
just as a doctor has the obligation to be honest and straightforward with their patients , democrats in @entity65 must inform the public of the impact their plans will have on current insurance and the exact costs			2
as the economy struggles to recover , @entity13 are rightfully concerned about the potential cost of health reform , as shown by a recent @entity12 survey			1
before we know how much it will cost and how it will affect those currently with insurance , we can not have an open and honest debate on the merits of any proposal			0
while the @entity86 bill remains unscored by the @entity87 , health overhaul plans being crafted by @entity10 will likely cost more than $ 1 trillion over 10 years and could fail to cover millions of @entity13			1
as a doctor , i know there is a better way to help all @entity13 achieve meaningful health care access			1
the president 's proposed cuts in health care spending will result in limited treatment options for patients , and by shifting the burden of debt to the next generation of @entity13 , our children will be the ones helping to defer the outrageous costs			1
with our government 's inability to maintain the @entity108 programs that we currently fund , how much deeper can the hole get ? the @entity109 refers to @entity6 ' failure to face @entity108 's monetary difficulties as a " leadership deficit			0
" even some @entity113 are asking if funding a new plan is even possible if the government can not solve the funding problems of the current plans			1
patients in these programs continue to be denied access to a doctor in many communities			0
a few months ago , i received an e-mail from a @entity126 patient diagnosed with a brain tumor			0
doctors told her that she would likely be put on a six - month waiting list for brain surgeons currently serving @entity126 patients			0
for timely care , she had to borrow a neighbor 's car , secure child care for her autistic child and drive four hours to a hospital in @entity139 , @entity5			0
patients in government - run plans obviously deserve better than this , so is this new government - run plan going to be any better ? republicans will give all @entity13 the liberty to select the plan that works best for them and let those who like their health care coverage keep it			1
we pledge to make quality health care coverage more available and less expensive , including those with pre-existing health conditions			0
we want to protect @entity13 from losing their current health coverage because an employer drops private coverage for a government - run program			1
this plan should also improve @entity13 lives through effective wellness , prevention and disease management programs , while finding innovative treatments for life - threatening diseases			2
we will ensure that medical decisions are made by patients and their doctors			0
by lowering costs and building more personalized plans , we can help more @entity13 develop a meaningful doctor - patient relationship			1
president @entity172 stated that " if you like what you 're getting , keep it			0
nobody is forcing you to shift			0
no one will take it away , no matter what			0
" this rhetoric sounds comforting , but fellow @entity10 do n't seem to share his view -- as evidenced by their proposed bill			0
some democrats are completely unwilling to reach across the aisle			0
sen. @entity185 , @entity186 , said , " my goal is to write a good bill ; my goal is not bipartisanship			0
" other @entity192 members were told " explicitly not to work with @entity3			0
" moderate @entity86 @entity10 even recently complained in a letter to several committee chairmen about being left out of any meaningful discussions on health - policy changes			0
health reform should be open and transparent			0
no matter what party weighs in on the issue , @entity13 must fully comprehend the complicated decisions we face , and also understand how these new decisions will affect them			2
leaders need to compromise , negotiate with members of both parties and ideologies , and reform health care the right way -- by developing a strong plan that encompasses the needs of all @entity13			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

rep. @entity2 : many @entity13 could lose current health plans
he says they could wind up in government system without current doctors
@entity2 : plans could burden next generation with *enormous* cost
