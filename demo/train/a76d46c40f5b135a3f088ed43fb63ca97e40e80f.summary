@entity0 returned to winning ways saturday with a 3 - 0 victory over mid-table @entity4 at the @entity5 , despite playing the majority of the second half with ten men			1
the @entity10 champions suffered back - to - back defeats against @entity12 and city rivals @entity13 in the space of four days last week , bringing a club - record 22 - match winning streak that began all the way back in september to an unceremonious end			1
but first half goals from @entity19 and @entity20 put @entity0 well on the road to recovery here			1
@entity25 full - back @entity24 was sent off for @entity0 at the beginning of the second half			2
however , @entity4 could n't take advantage of its numerical advantage			0
instead , substitute @entity29 added a third for real 15 minutes from time			0
it could have been even more had @entity20 made more of a chance when put through on goal before @entity29 sealed the win			1
but the @entity36 winger failed to square the ball to @entity38 who appeared to be in a better position to score			2
that led to jeers from the home crowd which did n't appreciate the $ 132 million man 's selfishness in front of goal			2
yet after the game , @entity0 boss @entity47 was quick to defend @entity20 when speaking to reporters			1
" @entity20 played a very good game			0
he had intensity , he scored , he helped in the first goal , " said @entity47 in quotes carried by the @entity53 news agency			0
" it could be in this moment the fans asked for a pass to @entity38 that he did n't make because , like all strikers in front of goal , they try to score			1
" we have fans that demand a lot and this is good			0
@entity20 is a fundamental player like @entity38 and that is why the fans demand more of them			1
" the result means @entity0 move four points clear at the top of the @entity72 table , although that lead will be reduced by either second - placed @entity74 or third - placed @entity13 which face off against one another in the @entity77 capital tomorrow evening			2
looking beyond that , @entity47 will be seeking harmony in the squad as @entity0 prepare for the second leg of their @entity82 last - 16 - tie against city rivals @entity13 on thursday			2
@entity13 triumphed 2 - 0 in the first leg at the @entity84 last week and @entity0 have n't beaten them in three attempts this season			1
" we have time to prepare well , " @entity47 said			0
" we 'll play our strongest team because we want to turn around the result of the first leg and try our best to get to the quarter - finals			0
" i think everyone is waiting for this game			0
it is difficult for us but we are going to play our best and playing at home will help us			0

ten man @entity0 defeat @entity4 3 - 0
@entity19 , @entity20 and @entity29 score for @entity10 champions
@entity20 booed by @entity104 crowd after failing to set @entity38 up for goal
