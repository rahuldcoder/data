@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the aftermath of 9/11 , @entity3 were angry , fearful and scrambling for answers			1
in the days that followed the terrorist attacks , president @entity6 and @entity7 prepared their response , starting to work on stronger counterterrorism measures and preparing for a war in @entity13 , where the @entity14 had housed @entity16 networks for many years			1
a few @entity3 turned their rage against @entity18 who were living in the @entity3			1
within a few days , @entity18 , as well as individuals mistakenly perceived to be @entity18 , were attacked			0
the @entity21 owner of a gas station in @entity23 , @entity24 , was killed by a man who went on to shoot a @entity27 clerk at another gas station			0
near @entity29 , @entity30 , a man shot and killed a 46 - year old @entity32 who owned a small grocery store			0
in @entity35 , @entity36 , a man drove a @entity37 right through an @entity39 center			1
nine years after 9/11 , there is a lot for @entity3 to contemplate as they look back			1
although people have focused a lot of attention on @entity6 's appearance before a group of @entity49 firefighters at ground zero , another highly significant moment took place on september 17			1
that day , at the @entity53 in @entity54 , the president delivered a powerful message about the need to keep @entity3 's response to 9/11 from turning into a war against @entity18			1
this message was as important to his war on terrorism as the strategy of regime change , or pre-emptive war			0
unfortunately , this is a principle that has been slowly and dangerously undermined in recent weeks as a result of the controversy over a proposed @entity39 cultural center and mosque a few blocks from ground zero			1
speaking at an emotionally charged moment , just six days after the attacks , @entity6 told the audience that it was vital for @entity3 to understand that the terrorists did not represent the @entity18 tradition			1
" those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger do n't represent the best of @entity3 ; they represent the worst of humankind , and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior , " @entity6 said			1
the president reiterated his firm commitment to protecting the constitutional rights and honoring the important role of the @entity18 community in the @entity3			1
in no uncertain terms , @entity6 said : " the face of terror is not the true faith of @entity39			1
that 's not what @entity39 is all about			1
these terrorists do n't represent peace			0
they represent evil and war			0
" @entity3 , he said , " counts millions of @entity18 amongst our citizens , and @entity18 make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country			1
@entity18 are doctors , lawyers , law professors , members of the military , entrepreneurs , shopkeepers , moms and dads			0
" many @entity18 leaders were impressed by the president 's speech as well as by how most @entity3 were responding to the trauma			1
" @entity3 have shown great maturity , " @entity119 , the secretary general of the @entity120 , told the media			2
he reported the calls he was receiving expressing support for his community greatly outweighed the hate crimes			0
over the coming years , @entity6 stuck with the argument that he made on september 17			2
while @entity6 would come under criticism for many aspects of his war on terrorism -- including policies such as the use of interrogation tactics that critics called torture -- he continued to be very clear in his defense of @entity18			2
the president returned to the @entity53 on june 2007 , reminding his audience of his earlier speech : " we gather , with friendship and respect , to reaffirm that pledge -- and to renew our determination to stand together in the pursuit of freedom and peace			0
we come to express our appreciation for a faith that has enriched civilization for centuries			0
" @entity6 's philosophy is now under fire			2
in response to the proposal to build an @entity39 center near ground zero in @entity49 , a heated national debate has unfolded about @entity18 in @entity3			1
while some focused their criticism on whether this was a proper project so close to the site of the attacks , many others turned it into a different kind of discussion			0
some national @entity169 leaders , including @entity170 and @entity171 , have made provocative comments , helping to make it a national issue			2
@entity175 warned of the " radical islamists " he said were behind the project , comparing it to @entity179 putting up a sign next to the @entity181 in @entity54			0
at the local level , the debate has taken an even more dangerous turn			0
a @entity186 pastor , @entity185 , announced he would burn copies of the @entity188			0
even when he came under criticism from a broad spectrum of leaders , including gen. @entity192 , he did not at first desist			0
rather than listening , he said , " maybe it 's time to send a message to radical @entity39 that we will not tolerate their behavior			1
" @entity170 did condemn the pastor by tweeting that " book burning is antithetical to @entity3 ideals , " but then tied the two issues together when she went on to say that " people have a constitutional right to burn a @entity188 if they want to , but doing so is insensitive and an unnecessary provocation -- much like building a mosque at ground zero			2
" although the pastor agreed to cancel the @entity188 burning after a call from secretary of defense @entity210 warning it would put @entity3 lives at risk , the incident stoked the fires of hatred			2
if this kind of inflammatory rhetoric continues , it will erode a central and crucial principle in the war on terrorism			0
it also contradicts the nation 's constitutional and pluralistic traditions -- the very traditions we want to defend from terrorism -- while doing irreparable harm abroad			2
when @entity6 spoke at the @entity53 , he took a pivotal step in defining how he wanted to defend the nation and go about punishing the aggressors who killed thousands of civilians			1
his message can not be forgotten			0
should local and national debate move in a different direction , we will be paying the cost as a nation for decades to come by destroying our image in the @entity18 world , thus playing into the hands of the terrorists			0
we 'd be abandoning the very best ideals that our country has to offer			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			2

after 9/11 , a few @entity3 *lashed* out at innocent *muslims*
@entity250 : president @entity6 rightly condemned such attacks at the time
he says that principle has been ignored by some @entity169 politicians
@entity246 : attacking @entity39 is at odds with @entity257 and key values nation is seeking to defend
