inside today 's three - story fiberglass pineapple there 's a museum devoted to the fruit			1
from the top there are great views of the surrounding pineapple fields and countryside			2

some came for a weekend and never left			0
the @entity106 , a retro and vintage clothing store specializing in " shabby chic , " is one among a group of art galleries and craft shops with funky collections			0
the store feels like a museum -- old suitcases are stacked beside a 1970s toaster alongside piles of vinyl records and " @entity121 " annuals dating to the 1950s			2
out front , the small lawn is bordered by lavender bushes and features a white ceramic toilet topped with a pair of black stilettos			0
" the toilet ? i 'm going to plant strawberries in it , " says owner @entity129 , as if it 's the most obvious thing in the world			2

" people live here because they want to get away from it all and there are some really interesting people here , like the couple down the road that run the @entity149			0

" inside , a wall is dedicated more wisecracks : " marriage is a relationship in which one person is always right and the other is the husband			0
" a leftover from early settlers , this is @entity69 wit at its silliest -- the sort found on old school seaside postcards and one - liners that might 've gotten a rise out of @entity193			0
souvenirs of these gags can be found at @entity196 , which sells shirts that can be printed with the customer 's name alongside the line " @entity201 -- just add alcohol			0
" the gallery also sells beautiful ceramics , art and fabric prints			0
