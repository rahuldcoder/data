-- @entity4 's " @entity3 " is getting closer to finalizing a judges panel for its 12th season			1
sources say @entity7 singer - songwriter @entity6 has now received a firm offer for a spot on the reality hit , which may expand to four judges next year despite shedding its entire previous panel			1
@entity0 reported last week that rapper @entity14 and @entity16 country artist @entity15 were poised to join pop diva @entity17 on the show , and that @entity6 ( or , if he passes , @entity19 ) could fill a fourth spot			1
longtime idol judge @entity21 is set to move to a mentor role			2
now we 're hearing @entity6 has received an offer for about $ 4 million per year , on par with @entity15 's deal			2
@entity4 and producers have only confirmed @entity17 at this point and have no comment on any of the other names or the number of judges			1
if the current panel plan comes together it will give @entity3 a four - quadrant strategy , with judges representing pop , rap , country and latin music ( sorry rock - and - roll , but have you looked at the charts lately ? )			0
@entity3 tried expanding to four judges once before and the network was said to be unhappy with the result , so this possibility is a bit surprising			0
but @entity49 's @entity48 managed to have four judges from different music backgrounds that have worked together quite well			0
plus , @entity4 's own @entity52 has a quartet of judges , too			2
@entity6 has a history of turning down reality show offers , but may very well sign on to " idol			1
" he was previously offered a spot hosting @entity52 , and was in talks with @entity49 for " @entity48			2
" with his career going " full blast , " @entity6 does n't need the @entity3 gig , but the show does have other career benefits			0
@entity6 became available to join the show last week , having just finished his latest world tour where he partnered with former idol judge @entity67			1
" @entity3 " returns to @entity4 in january			0
