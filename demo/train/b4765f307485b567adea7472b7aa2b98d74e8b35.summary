-- five who desperately needed new kidneys got them friday in an unusual five - way kidney transplant swap at a @entity7 hospital made possible by a computer program			1
" it 's just an amazing gift , " said @entity9 , a 65 - year - old @entity10 , @entity11 , woman who waited on a transplant list for five years before friday 's surgery			2
@entity17 , 62 , wanted to give a kidney to his wife , but his organ was incompatible			1
instead , his kidney was transplanted into another patient at @entity23 friday , while his wife received an organ from a stranger who agreed to the swap			2
" it 's a rare opportunity , " @entity9 told @entity0 affiliate @entity27 before a surgeon removed one of his kidneys			0
the process was repeated five times friday , with a live kidney going to someone who had a friend or relative willing to donate an organ that was not compatible for them but was a match for one of the others			1
this was the third five - way kidney swap done in the @entity45 , hospital spokesman @entity42 said sunday			1
computer software is becoming increasingly effective in making complex paired donation matches , he said			1
" every time we do one of these kidney paired donations , taking the patients off the waiting list , in a sense , it 's another kidney available for somebody who does n't have a living donor option , " said dr. @entity50 , the medical director of @entity23 's kidney transplant program			1
each recipient and donor agreed to guidelines to prevent " a breakdown along the way , " with a donor " suddenly saying ' i changed my mind ' " after the surgeries for the first had started , @entity59 said			0
" everyone was pretty much in the same boat , " he said			0
the donors did not know which patient would get their kidneys before the surgery and no one would find out unless each person agreed later			0
the procedures , involving 50 doctors , nurses and support staff , began at 7:30 a.m. with the last patient rolling out of surgery 10 hours later , @entity59 said			0
" they 're all doing well , " he said sunday			0
the transplant results are " very promising , " he said			0
for the @entity9 family , the paired donation advance has added importance for their future			0
april @entity9 's daughter @entity91 and son @entity92 inherited her genetic polycystic kidney disease , which means they expect to need transplants in the future			2
although 83,000 people are on the @entity45 waiting list for kidney transplants , the number of live kidney donors declined from 6,647 in 2004 to 6,387 in 2009 , according to the @entity102 .			1

computer software matches incompatible donors for five - way organ swap
@entity7 surgeons did all five transplants on the same day
all patients are doing well two days later , the hospital says
live kidney donations are down as the waiting list grows
