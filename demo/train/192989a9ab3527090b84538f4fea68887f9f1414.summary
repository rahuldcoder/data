-- the simmering warfare and political instability in @entity3 are probably far from over , and @entity7 military involvement there could very well last years beyond the end of 2011 -- when all @entity7 troops are scheduled to depart the war - torn nation , analysts who study @entity3 say			1
think - tank analysts who 've written about what 's next in @entity3 after the @entity7 combat mission formally ends tuesday say economic and infrastructure conditions need to be improved			1
and , they envision a persistent @entity7 presence in an @entity3 that remains unstable -- despite many improvements in the country 's security forces and political culture			1
while @entity7 and @entity3 officials point out that violence there has dropped , the attacks , like the wave of coordinated strikes across @entity3 last week , will continue , they say			1
" the @entity34 is not over and it is not ' won , ' " wrote @entity30 , who holds the @entity31 in @entity32 at the @entity33			0
" @entity3 still faces a serious insurgency , and deep ethnic and sectarian tensions			0
" analysts say a unified government is key to stability in @entity3 and the failure of lawmakers to form a new government after the march 7 national elections could exacerbate violence			1
@entity45 , director of @entity3 programs of the @entity47 , said the " primary fear " people have with the @entity7 combat mission ending is that " political parties will resort to violence to force alliances in power sharing " and " the @entity3 citizens will pay the price			1
" @entity7 and @entity3 officials point out that troops could remain past the end of 2011 if the @entity3 government requests a new deployment and both countries agree			1
@entity62 , a @entity63 senior fellow who spearheads the organization 's @entity64 , says a full removal of @entity7 troops by the end of next year would be a tall order			1
he said " too many sectarian wounds " are " unhealed " and there are " unresolved " disputes -- like the territorial fight between @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 around @entity76			0
" pulling all of our remaining troops out of @entity3 by the end of 2011 , as presently required under a @entity7 - @entity3 understanding negotiated by president ( @entity84 ) @entity83 and prime minister ( @entity83 in late 2008 , seems too risky , " @entity62 wrote in an article in @entity79			1
" our calming presence is useful , as @entity3 themselves agreed in a recent poll by a considerable margin , and there is no military or strategic need to rush for the exits			0
" @entity62 also said that any " renegotiation " of the december 31 , 2011 date " requires a new @entity3 government -- and there is no sign of one emerging			2
" @entity97 , an adjunct senior fellow at the @entity98 and a former senior adviser to the @entity100 in @entity3 , wrote a column for the @entity102 that said " @entity3 faces a raft of difficulties if it is to become an effective , self - governing nation , and all of them point to the need for a continuing @entity7 role in security and beyond			2
" he noted that the @entity7 troop surge blocked setbacks , such as civil war , and that only the @entity7 " can offer a credible guarantee " that the government " is not about to collapse			0
" " this is the reason that many observers , including @entity118 , former @entity7 ambassador to @entity3 , expect @entity3 's elected leaders to ask for troops past the planned pull - out target , " @entity97 wrote			1
he said @entity3 's politicians have the most to lose from the pullout			0
" the cost to @entity3 politicians of asking the former occupier to stick around is likely to be offset by the tremendous gains in public confidence associated with a prolonged @entity7 commitment -- especially if they ask early in their own election cycle , " @entity97 said			2
@entity97 said the situation in @entity3 is similar to @entity132 , where the @entity7 left troops after the 1953 armistice for stability and security			1
there are nearly 30,000 @entity7 troops in @entity132 almost 60 years after the end of the @entity140 , he said			1
he said the @entity7 was in @entity132 when it " was governed by a succession of military dictators " and into the 1980s as @entity132 " blossomed into a free and functioning democracy			2
" " in the coming year , the @entity3 government ( once it is formed ) is likely to ask the @entity7 to keep some significant number of troops in the country after the pullout date of summer 2011			1
if so , president @entity149 may well agree , because it is just about the only way to avoid a resurgence of civil war and continue @entity3 's tenuous progress toward consolidating democracy , " @entity97 said			0
@entity3 is known for its oil wealth and the @entity7 @entity157 projects oil production will expand into 2035			2
but @entity30 said that despite the oil industry , @entity3 's " economy is one of the poorest in the world in terms of real per capita income			0
" " it is the second year of a budget crisis that has force it to devote most state funds to paying salaries and maintaining employment at the cost of both development and creating effective security forces , " @entity30 said			0
the 30 years or so of conflict in @entity3 has taken its toll , @entity30 said , and " it will be years before @entity3 can overcome " their effect			0
" moreover , the bulk of a massive international aid effort has either been wasted or consumed in dealing with the insurgency , and aid is phasing down to critically low levels at a time @entity3 lacks both the funds and capability to replace aid or even take transfer of many aid projects			0
" @entity188 , a @entity7 foreign service officer who is now a fellow at the @entity98 , in an essay for @entity190 , cautions any @entity7 withdrawal from @entity3 must be responsible and added that " getting the country electrified " would be a key stride			2
" nothing would stabilize @entity3 more than reliable electricity , which would allow business growth and employment of those who might otherwise join militias to support their families , " she wrote			0
@entity30 said @entity3 in the future can be an asset in the region			0
it can help limit @entity205 's influence , divide @entity205 and @entity206 , give @entity207 a " key alternative to economic involvement with @entity205 , and " play a key role in securing the entire @entity211			0
" " the fact remains , however , that @entity3 is a truly vital national security interest of the @entity7 , and of all its friends and allies , " he said .			2

political stability is important for @entity3 , analysts agree
there are similarities between @entity3 and @entity132
@entity7 troops could stay beyond end of 2011
