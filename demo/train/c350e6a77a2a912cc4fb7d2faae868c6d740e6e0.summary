@entity0 , @entity1 -- the man who prosecutors said captained a team of masked men dressed as ninjas as they ambushed a @entity1 home has been found guilty on two counts of first - degree murder			1
a @entity12 jury determined thursday evening that @entity13 followed through on his plan and fatally shot @entity15 and @entity13 in the couple 's master bedroom , as one of their nine special - needs children looked on			1
he was also found guilty of armed home - invasion robbery			2
during the trial , @entity23 frequently conversed with his attorneys , shook his head and even smirked			2
he told judge @entity27 that he did n't need to call any witnesses or testify on his own behalf , because " the evidence speaks for itself			1
" and after the jury came out to ask a question during their four hours of deliberations , he said , " i 've already been tried and convicted by the media			0
" but @entity23 was stoic just before the verdict came in			1
meanwhile , members of the @entity37 family cried in the courtroom , with @entity15 's and @entity40 's daughter @entity39 hugging prosecutors			1
@entity23 nodded to the @entity37 family -- as he 'd done earlier thursday -- after he was fingerprinted and led away			1
the jury of 11 women and one man deliberated for four hours before reaching the verdict			0
in that time , they requested to see a 14 - minute surveillance video , culled from 16 cameras around the @entity37 house that were set up around the house to watch the nine special - needs children that the couple had adopted and were in the house of the time of the murder			1
one video showed a masked man -- who @entity58 , a member of the group , identified as @entity23 -- shooting @entity13 once in each leg			1
another video showed a scene from a girl 's bedroom as a red van packed with people arrives outside the house			0
the girl gets up from bed as the masked men enter the house , then hides under the covers pretending to sleep after hearing the commotion nearby			0
the van was owned by @entity23			2
a camera was not in the master bedroom			0
but @entity58 said that @entity23 led the @entity37 ' couple into the room			1
and expert witnesseses showed how @entity23 shot @entity13 once in the head and twice more as he lay face down on the floor , and then shot @entity13 through the head and chest			1
during closing arguments , assistant state attorney @entity85 painted an involved picture depicting @entity23 as the ringleader who hatched the plan , formed the team , outfitted six other men with guns and clothes , then led them as they barged into the @entity37 ' large home in @entity97 , @entity1			1
he said @entity23 was motivated by " simple greed " -- pointing to testimony from the defendant 's wife that the family 's business , a karate school , had gone under and they had dwindling means to take care of their six children			1
@entity23 knew @entity37 , who gave $ 5,000 to a self - defense charity he started , and he knew he had money , @entity85 said			2
@entity23 provided the all - black clothing , boots and guns and briefed the attackers prior to the invasion , according to @entity85			2
he said that @entity23 also did " all the talking [ and ] all the muscling " when the group entered the residence			2
" the puzzle pieces all come together , and they prove an ugly story , " said @entity85			0
" there is no doubt that @entity122 is the man who had his finger ... on the trigger			0
" @entity125 , one of @entity23 's attorneys , criticized the state 's case as overly reliant on circumstantial evidence and two men , @entity131 and @entity58 , who confessed their involvement and named @entity23 as the leader of the band of masked men and the shooter			1
@entity137 said there was no mention anyone would be killed until he overheard @entity23 say he was " going to kill somebody " minutes before they went to the house			2
prosecutors called the testimony of the two -- who were age 16 and 19 , respectively , when the crime took place -- measured and reliable , and supported by the other evidence in the case			0
but both @entity137 and @entity58 , who have pleaded guilty to second - degree murder for their roles , admitted first lying to family and law enforcement before changing their stories			1
" they 're hanging their hat on the testimony of those admitted liars , " @entity125 said of the prosecution			0
dna tests on the 9 mm pistol and bullet casings that killed the @entity37 ' couple did not conclusively point to @entity23 , @entity125 pointed out			2
he said , too , that there was minimal effort to clean the alleged murder weapon			0
" we do n't have to prove who the killer was , " @entity125 said			0
" no matter how tragic this murder is , if you have one reasonable doubt , then you have a duty to return a verdict of not guilty			0
" @entity137 and @entity58 testified that @entity23 said they were after $ 13 million of money laundered from " the @entity182 mafia			0
" a small safe that was stolen and later found in the back yard of one of @entity23 's friends contained prescription medication , family documents and some jewelry			1
two sources familiar with the investigation told @entity2 that a second safe at the home contained at least $ 100,000			0
in final comments , @entity85 reminded the jury of @entity23 's own words after he first spoke to police , when he reportedly said , " i 'm in deep , i 'll take the heat			1
" " the defense attorney labeled [ @entity23 ] @entity23 as being somewhat goofy , " said @entity85			0
" folks , he 's not goofy			0
he 's a murderer -- a plain , cold - blooded murderer			0
" the penalty phase in @entity23 's trial starts friday morning , judge @entity27 said			1
in @entity205 's @entity204 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
