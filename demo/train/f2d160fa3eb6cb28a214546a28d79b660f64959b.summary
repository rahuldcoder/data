@entity0 , @entity1 -- we found @entity5 's half - brother living in a @entity7 slum			1

" @entity5 's trip to @entity1 meant meeting family he had never known			1
in the book , which is popular in @entity7 and can be found in almost any supermarket , @entity5 looks back at his personal story and his struggles to reconcile with a @entity30 father who left him and his mother when he was just a child			1
@entity32 died in a car accident when @entity8 was just 6 months old			1
and like his half - brother , @entity8 hardly knew his father			1

" watch @entity8 talk about meeting his half - brother for the first time unlike his grandmother in @entity45 , in @entity1 , @entity8 had received little attention from the media			1
but reports surfaced in the past few days , springing from an @entity51 @entity50 article saying @entity8 is living in a shack and " earning less than a dollar a day			1
" the reports left him angry			0
" i was brought up well			0
i live well even now , " he said			0
" the magazines , they have exaggerated everything			0
" i think i kind of like it here			0
there are some challenges , but maybe it is just like where you come from , there are the same challenges , " @entity8 said			2
@entity8 , who is in his mid- 20s , is learning to become a mechanic and is active in youth groups in @entity0			2
he said he tries to help the community as much as he can			0
at least one of his neighbors feels that perhaps the candidate should help the brother			0
" i would like @entity8 to visit his brother to see how he is living , to improve his way of life , " said @entity73 , who runs a small dispensary near @entity8 's house			1
but @entity8 will have none of it			2
he draws inspiration from his famous half - brother			0
he acknowledges that he is biased but said he knows that his half - brother will be the next president			0
" because he wants to be [ president ] , " he said			0
" i think in life , what you want is what you are supposed to get			0
