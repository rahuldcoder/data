when a storm has the potential to cause " significant " damage , meteorologists may include terms such as " major house and building damage likely , " " complete destruction possible " or " major power outages in path of tornado highly likely			0
" in a " catastrophic " outlook , descriptions may include " this is a life - threatening situation , " " you could be killed if not underground or in a tornado shelter , " or " complete destruction of entire neighborhoods likely			0
