@entity0 , @entity1 the man who captained @entity4 lived in a picturesque neighborhood in the suburbs of @entity0 , @entity1 's second - largest city			1
we headed there to see if family members or friends wanted to talk to us about him			1
these types of assignments are never easy			0
we are well aware that the last thing many people in mourning want to do is to talk to a journalist			0
i 've done this long enough to know that the smart thing is to have the decency to offer condolences and leave if mourners say they do n't want to talk			0
but this family did n't feel that way			2
they were gracious and warm to us , and invited us to join other mourners who were with them			0
experienced pilot the captain of the ill - fated airliner , known only as @entity31 -- many @entity1 go by one name -- had been with @entity4 for six years			1
he had worked for another airline in @entity1 for 13 years before that , and was an @entity1 @entity36 pilot for a decade prior			2
when we arrived at his home , his wife , @entity37 , answered the door			2
she and @entity31 have two children ; a daughter named @entity43 who is about to turn 25 , and a 7 - year - old son named @entity45			1
we told her we wanted to do a story about @entity31 , that we hoped to find out what kind of husband and father he was ; what kind of man and pilot he was			1
she invited us inside where we offered our condolences and asked if she would to talk to us on camera			0
she told us she was n't sure if she wanted to talk , but invited us to come back later in the morning			0
we came back two hours later and the house was full of family and friends offering support to @entity37 , her children , and @entity31 's elderly mother and father			1
what was taking place in the house was an @entity1 tradition known as a layat , a visitation by people when there is death in a family			2
there were dozens of people , old and young , sitting on the floor of @entity79 's home			1
the house was so crowded that other mourners sat out in the front of the house , and some sat at tables that had been put in the middle of the closed off street			0
' kind and loving ' father and husband @entity37 and @entity43 , her daughter , invited us to sit down with them , and it was there that they decided they did want to say a few words to us about @entity31			1
the portrait they painted about this man made it clear that he was kind and loving , fun and even - tempered , hard working and dedicated			1
i marveled at how kind @entity79 's wife and children were to us , how kind his parents were to us			1
they were suffering so much , yet they wanted to make us feel at home			0
i told his daughter not to worry about us			2
she told me her father had taught her to be hospitable			0
@entity43 is not ready to give up hope that someway , somehow he and other people on the plane might still be alive			0
but she knows that is unlikely and told us she is prepared to accept reality			0
this family made it very evident they were lucky to have @entity121 in their lives			0
we said our goodbyes to this gracious family , realizing that the fated plane 's pilot was also very lucky to have them .			1
