@entity1 a @entity1 synagogue turned from peaceful sanctuary to house of horrors within moments tuesday when two @entity8 cousins wielding a gun and butcher knives attacked during morning prayers -- a terror attack that @entity14 's leader characterized as " blood libel " fanned by @entity8 leaders			1
even as @entity19 president @entity18 condemned the attack , @entity14 prime minister @entity17 said he was " glad " but insisted it " is not enough			1
" addressing reporters tuesday night , prime minister @entity17 called for national unity against " those human animals who committed this massacre " and against those -- singling out @entity26 , the @entity28 movement and the @entity19 -- who he claims " disseminate libels against the state of @entity14			1
" " there are those who wish to uproot us from the capital , from our land , " he said , referring to @entity1			2
" they will not be successful ... we have to unify forces			0
" @entity17 spoke hours after the latest act of violence to afflict the region , this time at a synagogue in @entity1 's @entity46 area			1
experts : no third intifada yet -- but little hope , either photos taken inside the @entity52 house of worship , and released by @entity14 officials , painted a grim scene -- from lifeless bodies sprawled on a floor to a shattered pair of glasses to blood seemingly everywhere , drenching holy books , prayer shawls and walls			2
three dual @entity65 - @entity14 citizens and a @entity67 - @entity14 citizen died in the attack before police shot and killed the two assailants			1
the terror attack -- the deadliest in @entity1 since a man with an automatic weapon killed eight seminary students in march 2008 -- came at a particularly tense time in that city and the region at large			1
it follows a series of recent deadly stabbings and vehicle incidents that , while not the large - scale suicide bombings that defined last decade 's second intifada or the rocket attacks from @entity85 earlier this year , have left @entity1 on edge			2
@entity17 blasts ' incitement ' by @entity8 leaders the answer to what 's next came quickly , as @entity14 authorities moved into the slain attackers ' @entity94 neighborhood of @entity96 to demolish their homes on @entity17 's order			1
the @entity8 ' official @entity100 news agency reported 13 people were arrested , including an @entity103 guard			1
@entity1 mayor @entity104 -- whose city is about two - thirds @entity52 and one - third @entity106 -- said the attack were incited by @entity26 and terror organizations who use " rumor and misfacts " about @entity8 are treated in the city			1
@entity113 , @entity17 's spokesman , said that authorities were also beefing up security around @entity1			1
" the goal is to make sure that there are not copycat attacks , " @entity113 said			0
the war of words between the two sides , meanwhile , continued			0
" ( @entity18 ) does not send out terrorists , he does n't directly encourage acts of terror , and this is good , " the @entity17 said , echoing an assessment by an @entity14 security chief			1
" on the other hand , the incitement of the @entity19 -- and he heads the @entity19 -- and even some things he says ... encourage terrorism , in terms of incitement ( of ) tensions that run high			2
" there was no such equivocation about @entity26 , the @entity8 militant group that controls @entity85			0
it 's been at odds with @entity14 and also with @entity18 ' @entity141 movement , which controls the @entity142			1
@entity26 did not claim responsibility for the synagogue attack , though it did n't back away from it either			0
@entity145 , a spokesman for the group , instead linked the attack to the discovery sunday of an @entity8 bus driver hanged in his bus not far from where tuesday 's attack occurred			1
( for his part , @entity17 said that claims the bus driver was killed were lies and that his death was ruled a suicide			0
) senior @entity26 official @entity159 predicted to @entity161 that " there will be more revolution in @entity1 , and more uprising			0
" " @entity26 in general supports action against the occupation , " @entity159 said			0
" @entity26 supports any military action against the occupation anywhere it can be carried out			0
" four rabbis killed the latest example of such an action came at 7 a.m. tuesday , when two @entity8 men entered a synagogue in an @entity175 neighborhood , where about 30 worshipers in prayer shawls and phylacteries were doing their morning prayers			2
" they began attacking worshipers , stabbing them before opening fire , " @entity14 's foreign ministry said			2
who were the victims ? the four killed were all rabbis : @entity187 , 58 ; @entity188 , 43 ; @entity189 , 59 ; and @entity190 , 55			0
@entity187 was a dual @entity67 - @entity14 citizen , and the other three were @entity65 - @entity14 citizens -- which is why the @entity193 is investigating the attack , according to a @entity65 law enforcement official			2
" when four great men , wonderful men , wise in @entity202 study , are slaughtered while praying in public , there is no public grieving greater than that , " said a rabbi who eulogized the men later tuesday , before their burial			0
eight others were wounded , including three who were seriously hurt and a policeman who was critically wounded , according to the foreign ministry			2
are you there ? share images , if you can safely officials overseas such as @entity67 foreign secretary @entity215 strongly condemned the killings , and @entity65 ambassador to @entity14 @entity218 called them " a barbaric new low in the sad and outrageous history of such attacks			0
" " tragically , this is not the first loss of life that we have seen in recent months , " @entity65 president @entity221 said after condemning " in the strongest terms " attacks he said were " a tragedy " for @entity14 and the @entity65			2
" too many @entity14 have died , too many @entity8 have died			1
and at this difficult time , i think it 's important for both @entity8 and @entity14 to work together to lower tensions and reject violence			1
" while no group claimed responsibility for the attack , @entity14 officials say the attackers came from @entity94 , where @entity8 can move more freely about the city than those living in @entity85 , who must pass through stringent checkpoints			1
@entity221 condemns ' horrific ' @entity1 terror attack @entity242 , a @entity8 news agency , identified the two men as @entity245 and his cousin , @entity246			1
whether their actions were part of a coordinated campaign or a spontaneous reprisal , tuesday 's attack raises the specter of yet more violence against civilians			0
the latest wave began earlier this year with the kidnapping of three @entity14 teens , who were later found dead			0
reprisal attacks , rocket fire and retaliatory airstrikes followed that incident , with more than 2,000 palestinians and 67 @entity14 reportedly killed after weeks of heavy fighting			0
much of the most recent unrest has been centered around @entity1			0
that includes the discovery of the body of @entity8 bus driver @entity269 on sunday , the same day an @entity14 was stabbed with a screwdriver near central @entity1			1
last week , a 20 - year - old was stabbed and killed in @entity272 , and three people were stabbed -- one fatally -- near the entrance to a settlement in the @entity142 , the same spot where the three @entity14 teens were kidnapped			0
@entity2 's @entity277 and @entity278 reported and wrote from @entity279 , while @entity2 's @entity280 reported from @entity1			0
