q : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a @entity14 @entity21 ? @entity1 : i was sitting watching a comedy show on a local tv station here in @entity26 when i got the call from @entity0			1

we really hope to get support from individuals -- and more so from corporate companies and other nonprofits -- to reach our target of lifting 100,000 households out of poverty by 2015 , by giving them lamps and helping them to set up economic ventures			0
we want to set up a modern workshop , with modern equipment that will include a plastic recycling plant , all for making the lamps			0
we need support to do this			0
q : what do you want people to know most about the importance of your work ? @entity1 : just seeing livelihoods change , especially from the small economic ventures that are being set up [ with ] the money initially spent on kerosene ... it 's the best thing we can ever do for these communities			1
