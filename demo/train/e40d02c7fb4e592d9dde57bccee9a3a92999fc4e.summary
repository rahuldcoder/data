" once his guilt was established , @entity28 was immediately executed , it said			0
the @entity0 report described @entity28 as " despicable human scum " and " worse than a dog , " and said he had betrayed his party and leader			0
" this is a stunning development , " @entity35 , a senior fellow at the @entity36 , told @entity37 on thursday			1
" i 've been following @entity3 for 20 years and i do not remember them ever publicly announcing the execution of a senior leader			1
you hear rumors about it , but this theatrical arrest earlier in the week and now this execution are unprecedented			0
" he added , " the regime , i think , is trying to intimidate anyone that might have independent ideas or harbor any ambitions			0
" @entity0 's report comes days after @entity28 was removed from his military post			1
@entity28 , who was married to @entity2 's aunt , had served as vice chairman of @entity3 's top military body and had often been pictured beside the 30 - year - old leader , who has ruled @entity3 since the death in 2011 of his father , @entity60			1
it has previously been reported that @entity62 -- the late father of @entity60 and the architect of the @entity3 state -- disapproved of @entity28 's marriage into the family , according to @entity67			1
in @entity70 , a @entity69 official acknowledged having seen the report of @entity28 's execution			0
" while we can not independently verify this development , we have no reason to doubt the official @entity0 report , " deputy spokeswoman @entity73 said in a statement			0
" if confirmed , this is another example of the extreme brutality of the @entity3 regime			1
we are following developments in @entity3 closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region , " @entity73 added			1
" i think the message to people in @entity3 is : do n't mess with @entity2 , " said @entity88 , a senior fellow at the @entity90 - @entity89 at the @entity91 and author of " meltdown : the @entity95 of the @entity96			1
" " this is about as brutal and ruthless a signal that could possibly be conveyed -- that @entity2 is in charge and that anybody who seeks to create any kind of alternative power center is going to get destroyed politically and , in the case of @entity104 , physically as well			1
" he called the incident " the most dramatic , highly visible shakeup in the @entity3 leadership in decades			1
" @entity2 accused @entity28 and his allies of double - dealing behind the scenes , " dreaming different dreams " and selling the country 's resources at cheap prices , thereby threatening @entity3 's economic development , according to a @entity0 statement this week			1

" how does @entity3 make money ? two allies of @entity28 -- @entity139 - ha and @entity140 - kee -- were recently executed , @entity142 lawmakers told reporters prior to friday 's report			1
the lawmakers , including @entity146 of the governing @entity147 , said they had received a briefing from @entity142 's @entity149			0
@entity37 has not been able to independently confirm the report			0
@entity3 , a state shrouded in secrecy , has been involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and @entity155 powers over its nuclear weapons program			2
tensions between @entity3 and @entity142 soared this year as @entity158 reacted angrily to tightened @entity160 sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test			2
the two sides are still technically at war after the @entity3 conflict , which began in 1950 and ended in 1953 in a truce , not a treaty			2
the @entity142 government held a national security meeting on friday morning and was keeping a close eye on events in the north , @entity169 spokesman @entity168 - do told reporters			0
on a separate note , @entity176 has accepted a proposal from @entity158 to meet on december 19 in the @entity179 , the spokesman said			0
the execution may have repercussions among the security and military forces as well as in the economy , since @entity28 was well - connected in those areas , @entity91 's @entity88 said			1
" all those people now are either going to have to make very visible that they 're abandoning that previous connection and that they 're going to show total loyalty to @entity2 , or they 're going to be in trouble			2
" but it 's not clear what , if anything , the incident may portend , he added			0
" it raises a lot more questions than answers			0
" for example , the killing could affect @entity158 's relationship with @entity201 , since @entity28 had dealt extensively with @entity202 -- @entity3 's biggest and most important neighbor and supplier of food and aid , said @entity88 , who was a @entity37 correspondent			1
" i think the @entity202 saw him as a sober , adult supervisor " of the untested young leader , he said			0
and @entity158 's denunciation of @entity28 -- which implied he had had dubious connections with an outside power -- was likely referring to @entity202 , whose leaders may now be " deeply unsettled , " @entity88 said			1
the incident could have even wider repercussions , @entity88 said			2
if there is a sense of instability inside @entity3 , with top - level people getting killed and others at risk , " there 's always the temptation to strike out externally , " @entity88 said			1
" you ca n't rule that out			0
