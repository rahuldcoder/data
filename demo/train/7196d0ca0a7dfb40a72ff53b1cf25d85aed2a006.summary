-- as a @entity4 , and as somebody who has been blessed with a top - tier education , the idea that teenage girls could be snatched from their school in northeastern @entity4 is particularly chilling			1
i was born and raised in @entity8 but spent some of my childhood in @entity11 , in the southeastern part of @entity4			1
i studied at @entity13 and @entity14 , and my thirst for knowledge made journalism a natural choice			0
i would n't be working as a @entity0 reporter today if it was n't for the fact that my parents fled @entity4 during the @entity23 and my mother , despite losing my father in a car accident , sacrificed everything to send me to good schools in @entity8			1
girls in @entity30 , @entity4 , now have to decide between staying alive and getting an education			1
aside from the nearly 300 school girls who were kidnapped in april , 56 boys at a boarding school were also recently killed			1
this is particularly heart - wrenching because i 've always believed education is freedom , especially for children in northeastern @entity4 whose education will be the only chance they have at eventually escaping poverty like my parents did			1
however , the unyielding presence of @entity43 has meant that education has become a choice between life and death			2
and parents , who are naturally more concerned about their children living to see another day than anything else , have stopped sending their children to school			0
kidnappings are not just limited to @entity43 's antics in the northern part of @entity4 but are widespread throughout the country			1
every @entity58 , @entity4 who live in the western world often travel back to @entity4 for the holidays			1
the sheer presence of so many foreigners often means an sharp uptick in the number of ransom kidnappings			0
whenever i return to @entity4 , i follow sharp instructions from my mother not to tell too many people i 'm coming back , not to announce my arrival ahead of time , and not too stay in one place for too long			1
we 've become even more cautious after my uncle was kidnapped three years ago			1
he was living between @entity73 and @entity74 at the time and returned to @entity4 to visit family			2
one evening , as he was pulling into my grandmother 's compound , kidnappers sneaked in behind him on foot			0
they knocked on the window to his car , and as soon as he rolled down the windows , they hit him over the head , took over his vehicle and drove him five hours through the night			0
it was by miracle that the car they used broke down			0
the kidnappers -- and my uncle -- were were stranded			0
they panicked and let him go			0
for a very long time , he was afraid to ever go back to @entity4			2
when my uncle shares that story , people are n't necessarily as shocked as you might expect			0
the first thing people ask him is not , " oh my goodness , you were kidnapped ? " but rather " who did you tell you were coming back to @entity4 ? " this is a country where no one is immune from the rife practice of hostage taking and if you travel to @entity4 , the onus is on you to stay safe			1
if the @entity4 president 's cousin can be kidnapped and the finance minister 's mother can be held hostage , then anyone else can be , too			1
for that reason , i 've always tried to avoid traveling back to @entity4 alone , especially during @entity58			2
i simply wo n't do it			0
and when i am there , the idea of going out after dusk alone is inconceivable			0
every time my mother tells me , " you need to go to @entity4 this year , " i often look for any excuse to get out of it			2
it pains me to admit that because i cherish my memories of going to school in @entity4 and the chances of anything happening to me -- though possible -- i hope are unlikely			2
although i 'm not in @entity4 physically right now , the story about these girls has haunted me from day one			1
whenever i read headlines about the missing schoolgirls , there 's always this feeling of guilt that hovers over me			0
it 's hugely unfair that i live comfortably in a first world country , in a nation that affords me the freedoms and luxuries that i ca n't imagine living without and those girls , whose only wish is to get an education , have to live in a constant state of fear			2
that 's their life every single day , and had my parents not made the sacrifices they did , that could easily have been my life too			0
my heart bleeds for them .			0
