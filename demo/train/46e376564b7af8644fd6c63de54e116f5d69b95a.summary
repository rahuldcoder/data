-- could the captured @entity2 boss who was one of @entity4 's most wanted fugitives be heading to the @entity5 for trial ? he will , if @entity5 federal prosecutors have anything to say about it			1
@entity9 , a spokesman for the @entity5 attorney 's office for the @entity12 , said sunday that @entity5 authorities plan to seek the extradition of @entity16 " @entity15			1
authorities captured the notorious drug lord saturday in the @entity4 @entity20 resort city of @entity21			2
cases are pending against him in @entity24 and several other @entity5 jurisdictions , and it 's not clear which requests would take priority			1
but just because the @entity5 wants to extradite him does n't mean @entity15 will be heading north of the border any time soon			1
" @entity4 is going to want to prosecute him			1
they 're going to want the first shot at him , " @entity0 law enforcement analyst @entity32 said sunday			0
" the extradition to the @entity5 could happen at a later date , but i doubt it			2
i think that the @entity4 are going to want him , and they 're going to want to keep him in prison down there			1
" @entity15 escaped from a high - security @entity4 prison in 2001 , reportedly hiding in a laundry basket			1
throughout the years , he avoided being caught because of his enormous power to bribe corrupt local , state and federal @entity4 officials			1
his nickname , which means " @entity50 , " matches his 5 - foot - 6 - inch frame			0
from @entity24 to @entity52 , @entity53 to @entity54 , @entity15 and his lieutenants are named in indictments for marijuana , cocaine and heroin trafficking , as well as racketeering , money laundering , kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder			2
in @entity52 , the city 's crime commission named @entity15 its @entity67 last year			1
but more than anywhere else , @entity32 said , the " @entity67 " designation is true for @entity15 in @entity4			1
" he 's responsible for the deaths of thousands of people			0
he 's considered one of the richest men in the world , and the @entity2 ... is considered the most prolific drug - trafficking organization in the world , " said @entity32 , former assistant director of the @entity73 's @entity72			2
when @entity15 escaped from prison , he had served seven years of a 20 - year , nine - month sentence			1
@entity4 's attorney general 's office said there were eight warrants for @entity15 's arrest there -- two tied to his 2001 escape , and six more for alleged crimes committed since then			1
authorities said they were taking him to the @entity91 prison outside @entity92 on saturday , where he was set to be interrogated			0
no attorney had yet come forward representing the cartel boss , officials said , and no extradition request had been made			0
@entity98 , the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity5 , told the @entity99 that authorities from the @entity5 and @entity4 had been working together on the case for months , but had n't worked out whether @entity15 would be extradited			1
" i think it 's important that first he faces the charges against him in @entity4 , " @entity98 told the newspaper			1
rep. @entity105 , chairman of the @entity106 , said @entity4 officials should consider extradition now			2
" the normal sequence is , @entity4 being a sovereign nation , ( it ) has the first prosecution			2
however , there 's a history here			0
he escaped from a prison in 2001			2
there is corruption in that country			0
and i would ask that the @entity4 consider extraditing him to the @entity5 , where he will be put into a ' supermax ' prison under tight security , where he can not escape , and be brought to justice with a life sentence , " @entity105 told @entity124 's " @entity123			1
" " i think that would be the best course of action for not only @entity4 , but also the @entity5 , in ensuring that what happened in 2001 does not happen again			1
" how likely extradition is , the @entity53 @entity131 congressman said , depends on how much pressure the @entity133 puts on @entity4 's government			2
but he said it would be worth the effort			0
" the track record 's not good with this individual , " he said			0
" this is an exceptional case			0
this is the largest , biggest drug lord we 've ever seen in the world			0
" @entity144 , who spent three decades with the @entity147 and headed the agency 's @entity148 , said extraditing @entity15 is the only way to truly cripple his organization			0
" it is a significant arrest , provided he gets extradited immediately to the @entity5 , " @entity152 told @entity0 saturday			0
" if he does not get extradited , then he will be allowed to escape within a period of time			0
... if he is , in fact , incarcerated , until he gets extradited to the @entity5 , it will be business as usual			0
" @entity158 and @entity0 's @entity159 and @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
