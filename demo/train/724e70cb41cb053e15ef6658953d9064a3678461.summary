-- as you get older , it 's important to make small changes to your diet to protect your long - term health			1
here are seven nutrients to zero in on after turning 50			1
@entity8 why you need it : scientific journals have been bursting at the seams in recent years with new research about the importance of vitamin d , and according the data , the vast majority of women are n't getting enough			1
one recent study found that adults with the lowest blood vitamin d levels were about twice as likely to die from any cause compared to those with the highest levels			2
other studies have linked adequate intakes to lower rates of obesity , type 2 diabetes , heart disease , high blood pressure , osteoporosis , depression , certain cancers , and brain disorders such as alzheimer 's disease			1
this key nutrient is also tied to enhanced immunity , muscle functioning , and injury prevention ( pretty impressive , huh ? )			1
@entity8 's nickname is the " sunshine vitamin " because exposure to the sun 's ultraviolet rays triggers its production in the body , but you ca n't rely on the sun as your sole source			1
your location , cloud cover , smog , time of day and year , and sunscreen use all affect your uv exposure and vitamin d production			2
how to get it : some of the best natural food sources include wild salmon , whole eggs ( the @entity63 is in the yolk ) , and mushrooms , and it 's in fortified foods like dairy , but it can be difficult to eat enough of these foods to meet your needs , so a supplement may be your best bet			2
@entity73 : 12 ways to get your daily @entity8 how much is safe : to identify the right amount to take , get your blood level tested			1
based on the results , your doctor can recommend the proper daily dose			2
calcium why you need it : bone density declines more rapidly after 50 , and one in three women over this age will experience a bone fracture			1
research shows that in the first years after menopause , women may lose 3 to 5 % of their bone mass annually , and increases in calcium intakes generally do n't offset the losses			1
calcium is also required for muscle contractions , so this mineral allows you to get the most from every workout			1
it 's also needed for nerve function , and helps maintain your body 's acid / base balance , so there are plenty of reasons to strive to hit the suggested mark			0
how to get it : while dairy may be your first thought , there are also several plant - based sources , including dark leafy greens , beans and lentils , nuts , and dried figs. how much is safe : if you choose to use a supplement , just be sure not to go overboard			0
the recommended daily calcium intake for women over 50 is 1,200 mg per day , but the maximum advised limit , from both food and supplements combined , from age 51 on is 2,000 mg per day			1
i 've seen plenty of women exceed that amount ( sometimes unknowingly , sometimes because they mistakenly believe more is better ) , and getting too much can be risky , with potential side effects including kidney problems , kidney stones , and calcium deposits in soft tissues			1
high calcium intakes can also lead to constipation , and interfere with the absorption of iron and zinc , and recently , excess calcium has been linked to a higher risk of heart disease			1
talk to your doctor or dietitian to be sure you 're striking the right balance			1
@entity73 : 14 surprising facts about healthy bones probiotics why you need them : probiotics have been shown to boost immunity , improve digestive and skin health , lower " bad " ldl cholesterol , fight gum disease , and enhance weight control , so there 's plenty to benefit from for women over 50			1
how to get them : while foods like yogurt , kefir , kimchi , and sauerkraut contain probiotics , it may be difficult to consume enough of these " friendly bacteria " on a daily basis through food alone			1
how much is safe : if you opt for a supplement , ask your doc or dietitian for a recommended brand and amount			0
there 's currently no standard dose for probiotics , like those that have been established for vitamins and minerals ; and while probiotics are generally considered to be safe , your personal medical history should be taken into account before you pop a pill			1
@entity187 fatty acids why you need them : the omega - 3s @entity189 ( docosahexaenoic acid ) and @entity192 ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) are essential fatty acids that have been tied to vision and brain protection , healthy hair and skin , improved circulation , reduced muscle soreness , a lower risk of heart disease and depression , and a reduction in inflammation , which is a known trigger of aging and disease			1
this remarkable list of benefits makes getting sufficient amounts of these good fats particularly important in your 50s			0
how to get them : fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich sources , but a dislike of seafood or concerns about mercury may interfere with getting enough			0
and while plant - based foods like flaxseeds and walnuts contain a type of @entity187 called alpha - linolenic acid or @entity228 , your body only converts a small percentage of this form into @entity192 and @entity189 -- the two types that the vast majority of the research has focused on			0
how much is safe : if you choose to take a supplement that provides @entity189 and @entity192 ( vegan options are available ) , it 's important to note that there 's currently no standard daily dose for healthy adults			0
many experts recommend 1,000 mg of @entity189 / @entity192 combined , the amount advised for those with heart disease , and like some of the other nutrients i 've mentioned , it 's important not to go overboard			0
emerging research shows that too much omega - 3 may weaken immunity , and excess intakes have been linked to bleeding , especially when combined with medications or supplements that like omega - 3s , also have a blood thinning effect			1
once again , to pinpoint the amount that 's right for you , rely on advice from your personal health care providers			1
@entity73 : good fats , bad fats : how to choose magnesium why you need it : getting enough of this key " maintenance mineral " which is involved in more than 300 bodily reactions can keep your energy soaring and allow you to look and feel like you 've turned back the clock			0
magnesium helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function , keeps heart rhythm steady , supports a healthy immune system , preserves strong bones , and slashes stroke and heart disease risk			2
it also helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes normal blood pressure , but many women fall short of the recommended intake			0
how to get it : good food sources include spinach , almonds , cashews , black beans , quinoa , and pumpkin , sesame , and sunflower seeds			0
how much is safe : if you opt for a supplement , look for one with no more than 100 % of the daily value ( 400 mg ) , unless your doctor or dietician has advised differently			0
too much magnesium can trigger nausea , diarrhea , appetite loss , muscle weakness , breathing problems , irregular heartbeat , and dangerously low blood pressure			2
fiber why you need it : fiber - rich meals result in a steadier rise in blood sugar and a lower insulin response , as well as a slower rate of digestion and absorption , which keeps you fuller longer and delays the return of hunger			0
it also keeps you " regular " by helping your digestive system stay in tip top shape , and getting enough fiber is also a smart weight control strategy			2
research has shown that for every gram of fiber we eat , we eliminate about seven calories			2
that means if you eat 35 grams a day , you 'll essentially " cancel out " 245 calories -- a savings that could effectively stave off age - related weight gain			0
how to get it : to bolster your intake , rely on foods that are naturally fiber - rich , like fruits and vegetables ( especially those with an edible skin and / or seeds or tough stalk ) beans and lentils , and small portions of nuts and whole grains , including oats , whole grain rice , quinoa , and barley			2
@entity73 : 20 best foods for fiber water why you need it : @entity350 , your body 's most important nutrient , is required for every bodily process , and you lose water from your body each minute of the day			0
replacing those losses adequately can help you reap the benefits of water , including optimized mood and metabolism , as well as better digestive health ( especially if you 're stepping up your fiber game ) , and glowing skin			1
good old @entity350 is also linked to weight control			2
a recent study found that when middle - aged and older adults drank two cups of water prior to eating a meal , they ate between 75 and 90 fewer calories			0
another 12 - week study found that adults who gulped extra water lost about 30 % more weight following the same diet compared to those who drank less			0
and a small @entity378 study found that drinking two liters of water a day could result in burning up to 95 extra calories , an effect that could help fend off age - related weight gain			0
how to get ( more of ) it : according to the @entity384 ( @entity384 ) , women ages 19 and over need 2.7 liters of total fluid per day ( more than 11 cups )			0
about 20 % of your fluid needs are met by food , but that still leaves nearly nine cups based on the @entity384 's guidelines			0
while other beverages may count as fluid , water is the best way to meet your daily needs , so strive for at least 16 ounces four times a day			0
