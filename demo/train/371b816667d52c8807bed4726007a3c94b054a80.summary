@entity1 , @entity0 -- this month on the @entity4 we 're turning to the wonderful world of animated films			0
" @entity7 , " the latest in @entity9 ' inverted - fairytale franchise blockbusters like " @entity11 " and @entity9 ' franchise " @entity12 " have turned animation into a multi-billion - dollar industry , and a market once dominated by @entity16 is becoming crowded with competition			1
this year , @entity18 celebrates its 20th anniversary			2
from " @entity21 " to " @entity22 , " the company has transformed expectations about what 's possible with animated film			1
@entity18 's position as a world leader in animated film is largely down to @entity29 - considered by some to be the @entity16 for a new generation			1
from " @entity21 " and " @entity32 " to " @entity33 " and " cars , " the @entity18 back - catalogue is a testament to his creative genius			1
and when @entity18 merged with @entity16 he became one of the most powerful players in the movie business			1
the first @entity18 production released since the merger is " @entity22 , " the story of an unlikely alliance between a blundering trainee chef and a gourmet - loving rat			1
" @entity22 " director @entity48 's credits for @entity18 include the @entity50 - winning feature " @entity51 , " which won critical plaudits for its ground - breaking animation			1
he told @entity2 , " i think that one of the nice things about @entity18 is that they do n't feel like they have discovered the secret formula to making a good movie			2
they just keep focused on trying to make a movie that they would want to see			0
we are challenged and surprised every time they work out			0
" but while @entity18 and @entity16 may be the giants of animation they face formidable competition from another box - office monster -- shrek			1
the adventures of the world 's favorite ogre have generated a total of two billion dollars in takings			0
actor @entity73 , who voices @entity12 , told @entity2 that he thinks the movies ' appeal is their unlikely hero			2
he said , " with ' shrek , ' they took fairytales and turned them on their heads			0
traditional villains are heroes , traditional heroes are villains			0
the whole team decided , we 're going to look at somebody who has been told he was a villain and we 're going to make him a hero			0
that 's when i knew they were on to something			0
" the success of the @entity95 , supported by other big budget features such as " @entity97 , " has cemented @entity9 ' position as a major force in the animated world			2
another successful franchise -- " @entity101 " -- has been a hot seller for @entity103			0
and the polar climate has also been kind to @entity105 with last year 's @entity50 - winning " @entity109 " charming audiences around the world with a tale of dancing penguins , while the @entity114 - voiced " @entity113 " also scored well on its way to becoming a seasonal stocking - filler on dvd			1
the life - like motion - capture technique used in " @entity113 " will also feature in @entity105 's forthcoming release , " @entity118 " featuring @entity117			1
but in a market dominated by @entity121 animations , one of the big three summer blockbusters this year belongs to a more traditional form of the art. " @entity131 " is the world 's longest - running animated television series , and fans have eagerly awaited its move to the big screen			0
creator @entity132 told the @entity4 , " we 've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years			0
we 've had kids , they 've grown up , they 've become adults , they 've become writers for the @entity139 , so we had to do a movie after all this time			2
" so , will @entity142 's most famous inhabitants break all former animation records ? @entity132 and co. will certainly be hoping that the movie gets a box - office " @entity145 ! " from its fans			1
" @entity109 " is a @entity105 film ; @entity105 , like @entity2 , is a unit of @entity150			0

animation is now a multi-billion - dollar industry
movie franchises like @entity12 , @entity21 boost appeal to both adults and kids
@entity9 , @entity105 target *slice* of @entity18 's success
