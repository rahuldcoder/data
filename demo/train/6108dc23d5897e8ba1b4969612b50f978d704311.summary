@entity0 -- as @entity2 looks to usher in its next generation of leaders , one of the messiest political scandals to hit the ruling @entity6 in years continues to fester			1
two weeks after @entity8 was given a suspended death sentence in connection with the death of a @entity13 businessman , many are wondering : what will happen to her husband , @entity15 ? @entity15 , 64 , is a @entity6 " princeling			1
" his father was a contemporary of chairman @entity18 and @entity19 , and until recently @entity15 was a rising star in @entity2 politics			1
he was already in the party 's 25 - member @entity21 and was seen as a contender for the nine - member @entity24 that runs @entity2			1
but his political career unraveled abruptly when his wife , a lawyer and business consultant , was accused of murdering businessman @entity30			1
@entity8 avoids execution @entity8 's recent trial and conviction was swift			1
although short in credibility , it has allowed @entity15 's political rivals to sideline him			1
he has been in detention since april after being removed from his post in the @entity21 and as the party chief in @entity40 , a sprawling city in southwest @entity2 of more than 30 million people			1
curiously , @entity8 's trial avoided any connections between @entity15 and the murder			1
in fact , @entity15 's name was not even mentioned during the seven - hour trial			1
murder trial at heart of @entity2 political scandal analysts say @entity15 would probably escape criminal charges but is likely to be expelled from the @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
" getting expelled from the @entity6 is the nail in the coffin , " said @entity53 , a professor at the @entity54			2
still , some analysts say @entity0 is handling @entity15 with care			1
" excessively harsh treatment of @entity15 may cause a small earthquake in the political system because he is part of this network of princelings who also occupy important positions in the government and the military , " said @entity59 from the @entity60 in the @entity61			1
@entity8 , the woman who had it all the @entity15 affair has already sparked @entity2 's most serious political crisis in decades and has revealed fissures in the top echelons of the normally opaque @entity6			1
" ( @entity15 ) was definitely part of this factional warfare , " said @entity77 , a sinologist and author who teaches at the @entity79			2
" i think of @entity2 factions as developing the moment somebody falls foul of the system			2
" this infighting comes ahead of the 18th @entity87			0
@entity15 's fall from grace much is at stake			1
the @entity87 , likely to be held in october , will announce the new lineup of leaders who will run @entity2 in the next decade			2
jockeying for top positions is at final stage			0
another hot issue is the size of the @entity24 , currently a nine - member body that runs the country			0
some reports say the new body might be pared down to seven members to make it more nimble and efficient -- and to drop from the elite body one slot reserved for the head of the @entity6 @entity106			2
this @entity108 body manages @entity2 's police , judges , lawyers and courts nationwide			1
it is now headed by @entity114 , believed to be an ally of @entity15			2
@entity15 and @entity8 on trial , in different ways other reports say it will remain a nine - member body to accommodate more representatives of the various factions			1
just as contentious are debates over policies			0
" i suspect the agenda of the @entity87 will include such issues as social welfare , energy , environment , inequality and anti-corruption , " said @entity53			0
ironically , they are some of the issues that @entity15 championed in @entity40			2
" websites suggest @entity15 has public support , but the new leadership can have ' @entity137 without @entity15 , ' which means more housing for the poor , efforts to narrow inequality and fight corruption , " @entity53 added			0
@entity2 media last week said the party is launching yet another five - year plan to curb corruption			1
lately the @entity2 media have reported a slew of egregious graft cases			0
for example , @entity149 , the party chief of @entity150 in northeastern @entity152 province , has reportedly fled to the @entity61 allegedly with a loot of over $ 31 million , while @entity2 police have put on their wanted list a certain @entity157 -- the president of a local bank in @entity160 , @entity161 province -- who is believed to have fled to @entity163 with this family with stolen assets worth millions of dollars			2
small fry are easily caught			0
in @entity169 province , a village party chief was recently sentenced to 12 years in prison for allegedly swindling friends and the local government of millions in public funds , including money allocated for road construction			0
" corruption is one of the top reasons for the public dissatisfaction with the government , " said @entity59			0
" clearly it hurts the very legitimacy of the @entity6 rule			0
" yet , despite repeated campaigns , the @entity6 has failed to eliminate the scourge			0
one reason , @entity2 watchers say , is its sheer prevalence in and outside the party			2
" it 's hard for a leader to stay clean when people find clever ways to bribe his or her spouse and other family members , " @entity59 said			0
@entity197 faces the other challenge of managing people 's expectations			0
" things are a lot better now , but certainly there are a lot of people who are not doing well , " observed @entity201 , a former @entity1 correspondent and now a senior fellow at the @entity204 's @entity61 - @entity203 in @entity205			0
" the party needs to figure out how to be more responsive to the people			0
they ca n't just rule by dictate			0
" that is no longer possible , @entity201 explained , because of the emergence of the @entity214 and social networking services such as @entity2 's @entity217 - like service , @entity216			1
" the party can not just tell people what to do , " he said			0
" it 's a much more interactive , back - and - forth process , so it 's a brand new world for the party			0
" adapting to the changing times , he added , will be the underlying theme of the upcoming @entity87 .			0
