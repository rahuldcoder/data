@entity0 -- yesterday brought the sad and perplexing news that @entity3 , hugely successful @entity4 director of sleek , big - budget action films such as " @entity6 " and " @entity7 " had apparently taken his own life by jumping off @entity10 ' @entity9			1
it was a tragic end to a trailblazing career that took @entity3 on an amazing journey from modest , working - class beginnings in the northeast of @entity16 to the @entity18 a-list			2
he may never have received the recognition the @entity21 has bestowed upon his elder brother @entity22 , but @entity3 was n't out to please the critics and he did n't have aspirations to make high - art. instead he was a thrill - seeking adventurer who loved fast cars ( he got into filmmaking upon his brother 's assurance that he would be able to buy a @entity28 within a year ) and embraced the @entity30 way of life and filmmaking			1
@entity3 unapologetically specialized in action movies and , within his chosen genre , he was an undeniably accomplished figure			2
official : director @entity3 left notes in car , office perhaps surprisingly for a director so associated with @entity18 blockbusters , it was the @entity44 that launched both @entity3 and @entity22 's filmmaking careers in the 1960s , via its production fund supporting experimental filmmaking			2
the @entity44 provided a grant for @entity22 's debut short film " @entity51 , " which starred a beaming 16 - year - old @entity3 in the titular role , and subsequently helped fund the younger @entity3 's first directorial forays : the short films " @entity54 " and " @entity55			1
" from these early successes , @entity3 went on to direct hundreds of tv commercials for his brother 's production company , @entity22 ( @entity22 )			0
here he became a master craftsman , developing the heightened visual style and preoccupation with surface aesthetics that would later become the hallmark of his feature films			1
despite the film business ' historic disdain for the tv advertising industry , @entity3 and @entity22 were among the first to enter the world of filmmaking after directing commercials , forging a path that would later be followed by the likes of @entity75 and @entity76			0
since the mid- 1980s , @entity3 's name has been synonymous with action films ; populist , high - octane adventures that found little favor with the critics but thrilled audiences and almost always delivered generous box - office returns			1
working with producers @entity84 and @entity86 on films such as " @entity88 , " " @entity89 , " and " @entity90 , " @entity3 pioneered a new approach to the action film grounded in the glossy , heightened aesthetics and technical virtuosity of his tv commercials ( a @entity97 advert had helped him secure the " @entity88 " job )			1
director @entity3 : an appreciation bursting at the seams with the muscular ideology of the @entity105 era , these films eschewed emotional and dramatic realism in favour of bravura style , bombastic characters and escapist narratives			0
the approach proved box - office gold with " @entity88 , " which became the highest grossing film of 1986 , taking $ 176 million , and helping @entity84 become one of the most successful producers of all time			0
the 1990s saw @entity3 embrace darker territory with the @entity120 - set tale of adultery and murder , " revenge , " starring @entity124 , and the uncharacteristic road movie " @entity126 , " written by @entity127 and starring @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
@entity3 returned to big , loud , action movies with the apocalyptic submarine thriller " @entity6 , " the first of five collaborations with actor @entity135 ; the pair would team up again for " @entity137 , " " @entity138 , " " @entity139 " and " unstoppable			0
" the latter , a commercial and critical success , would prove to be @entity3 's last film , although at the time of his death the endlessly busy director reportedly had numerous projects ( including a rumored sequel to " @entity88 " ) in development			2
at 68 , one felt he still had several blockbusters left in him			0
his profound influence is felt in the glossy action movies of contemporary directors such as @entity153 ( " @entity160 " ) and @entity154 ( " @entity161 " ) , whose success has followed in the wake of @entity3 's creation of a new era - defining style of mainstream cinema			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity166 : @entity3 was a thrill - seeking adventurer and master craftsman
@entity3 pioneered a new " glossy " approach to the action film , says the film writer
the @entity4 director took his own life on *sunday* , jumping off a *bridge* in @entity10
