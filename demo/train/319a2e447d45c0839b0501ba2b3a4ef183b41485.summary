they asked me to be their ambassador , so i help them out as much as i can			1
@entity50 : tell me about your recent mission trip to @entity53			1
@entity19 : @entity18 chose @entity53 because of its high child mortality , so we got to see exactly what @entity18 is doing to provide healthy clean water , education , and protect these kids from preventable diseases			1
i got to see firsthand , and i got to help out myself			1
it was a really humbling experience for me			2
i remember a 14 - year - old and his friends going to each village , telling everybody how they wanted an education			2
you think about how many kids hate school here and how much they just wish they did n't have to go to school			2
you know , i was one of those kids			2
i complained all the time about having to do homework and i wanted to go out and play , and these kids are begging for school			2
... it was so powerful			2
it makes you more aware of how fortunate you are			1
there was this little kid playing with a bunch of plastic bags that he wrapped string around , and it was a soccer ball			2
that 's all he needed			1
and you think about all the @entity88 and all the things that kids " need " to be entertained here			2

i loved being around them			0
it got me excited to help more			0
@entity50 : do you think your work is having an impact with kids here in the @entity102 ? @entity19 : i am very blessed to have a lot of fans , and basically my goal is to use my voice to educate them on all of these things			0
you just need to tell them how			0
and you just need to encourage them			0
@entity50 : how would you describe a hero ? @entity19 : a hero to me would be someone that truly believes in something			0
the passion and the drive of wanting to make the world a better place , or to help out and to contribute in some small way , that 's a hero to me			1
@entity50 : back in 2008 , you were a presenter at " @entity4 : an all - star tribute , " and you helped honor @entity126 , who helps children in @entity129 , @entity130			0
