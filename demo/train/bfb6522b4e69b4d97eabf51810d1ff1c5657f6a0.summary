[ breaking news update , 10:07 p.m. et ] the @entity1 passed a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that will fund the government through september , approving it in an unusual saturday evening vote			1
[ previous story , 9:09 p.m. et ] the @entity1 passed a short - term spending bill that will fund the government through wednesday , averting a shutdown while the chamber debates a bill to fund the government			1
president @entity12 signed the stopgap funding bill saturday evening			1
without it , funding was due to dry up saturday night			0
the @entity1 will vote saturday night on the $ 1.1 trillion package that would fund the government through next september , senate majority leader @entity15 announced on the @entity1 floor			1
the bill has already passed the @entity20			0
sen. @entity21 , the incoming @entity1 majority leader , had previously reached a deal with @entity15 to adjourn for the weekend and resume monday to clear the bill			1
but in a surprise development , some of @entity26 's junior members defied the agreement after he left			0
@entity15 tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until monday when there would be enough votes to end a filibuster , but sen. @entity34 , a @entity35 from @entity36 , objected because @entity15 would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding			0
@entity35 sen. @entity40 of @entity41 also joined the objection , forcing the @entity1 to meet on saturday			2
@entity15 then announced to an almost empty chamber that the @entity1 would be in session beginning at noon saturday			2
will the government keep operating ? the @entity1 was facing a saturday deadline to approve the spending bill and avert a government shutdown , but that was pushed back			1
the chamber has been sifting through many of the same arguments that tied up the @entity20 on thursday , when disagreements over immigration and provisions related to @entity56 and campaign finance nearly derailed the bill			0
@entity1 lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues			1
two votes are expected monday : a procedural vote to block a filibuster and end debate on the bill , and a second one on the final passage			2
' using every tool available ' sen. @entity70 , @entity71 , and sen. @entity72 , @entity73 , filed an amendment that would strip a provision that softens financial regulations on banks from the spending bill			0
" @entity80 should not put taxpayers on the hook for another bailout , and this giveaway that was drafted by @entity86 lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill , " @entity79 said			1
@entity40 , a chief critic of @entity12 's recent executive action on immigration , also said he wanted a vote to block it			0
" i think it is critical that the @entity1 have the opportunity to have a clear up or down vote on funding president @entity12 's illegal executive amnesty , " he told reporters			1
" i am using every tool available to help bring about that vote			0
" but by making the procedural move , @entity15 prevented those amendments from being considered			0
amendment votes could have been risky , because if either measure passed , the spending bill would have to go back to the @entity20 to be voted on again			2
while the @entity20 is technically in session , most members have left @entity107 until the new @entity80 convenes in early january			0
a day after his administration scrambled to save the bill when it appeared it might be defeated in the @entity20 , the president said he was pulling for it in the @entity1			1
" i 'm glad it passed the @entity20 and am hopeful that it will pass the @entity1 , " @entity12 said .			2
