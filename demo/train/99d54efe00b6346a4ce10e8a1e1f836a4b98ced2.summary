@entity0 , @entity1 -- pope @entity3 said thursday the @entity4 is " profoundly and irrevocably committed to reject all anti-semitism			2
" pope @entity3 's meeting with @entity8 leaders comes on the heels of controversy			1
the pope was meeting @entity12 @entity8 leaders at the @entity13 on the heels of a controversy over @entity16 denial			1
last month the @entity13 lifted the excommunication of a rebel bishop just days after the broadcast of an interview in which he denied the existence of gas chambers and said no more than 300,000 @entity8 had died in @entity25 concentration camps			2
scholars have in fact documented approximately 6 million @entity8 deaths in the @entity16			2
the @entity13 has since ordered the bishop , @entity29 , to recant , and has said the pontiff was not aware of @entity29 's views on the @entity16 when the excommunication was lifted			1
the excommunication was not related to @entity29 's views on the @entity16			0
on thursday , @entity3 talked about his own visits to the sites of some concentration camps			0
" the hatred and contempt for men , women and children that was manifested in the @entity44 was a crime against @entity46 and against humanity , " the pope said , using the @entity38 word for the @entity16			0
he also reiterated his commitment to the groundbreaking @entity4 rejection of the centuries - old claim that the @entity8 killed @entity51			0
" @entity52 marked a milestone in the journey towards reconciliation , and clearly outlined the principles that have governed the @entity4 's approach to christian - jewish relations ever since , " @entity3 said			0
@entity8 reactions to the pope 's speech were broadly -- but not uniformly -- positive			1
" catholic - @entity8 relations are on track , " said rabbi @entity62 , head of the @entity63 and a @entity16 survivor , who was among the community leaders at the meeting with the pope			1
" we may have some setbacks , but when you have that strong bond of trust and friendship ... then we can face every challenge that comes our way			0
" the head of @entity80 's @entity16 museum , @entity81 , also praised the pope 's statement			1
" @entity81 places importance on the @entity3 's unequivocal statement condemning @entity16 denial and any attempts to minimize the scope of the @entity44 , " said its chairman , @entity84			2
" @entity92 's clear public denouncement of all types of @entity94 , during his meeting earlier today with @entity12 @entity8 leaders , is to be welcomed			1
" but @entity97 , the head of the @entity98 and another @entity16 survivor , said the @entity13 had to match its words with deeds			2
" to condemn the anti-semitism and @entity16 denial and to reinstate into the @entity4 a bishop who is an anti-semite and an @entity16 denier does not end the issue , " he said			1
and he urged the pope to expel @entity29 from the church again			0
" every day this man continues to remain a cleric , a bishop in the @entity4 , is an insult to the memory of all these survivors and victims and to the @entity8 people , " @entity97 said			0
@entity2 's @entity117 in @entity0 and @entity118 in @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
