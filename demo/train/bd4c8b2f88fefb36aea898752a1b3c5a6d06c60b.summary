-- how do you solve a problem like @entity3 ? after an eventful fortnight that saw the @entity7 striker gatecrash a press conference , row with teammates and crash his @entity10 , it 's perhaps no wonder that his club manager @entity12 has been driven to despair			1
when reporters this week quizzed @entity12 over an alleged locker room bust - up between @entity3 and teammate @entity17 , the @entity14 sympathized with his frustrated squad			1
" i can understand it			0
i told him ( @entity3 ) , if you played with me 10 years ago i would give you every day maybe one punch in your head , " @entity12 said ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity21 -- a match that could have a big bearing on the @entity25 title race			1
" i think in every big game he played very well			0
i think his problem is his concentration , but i work with him every day			2
" i speak with him -- not every day because if not i need a psychologist -- but every two days i speak with him			0
" it was one of @entity12 's most frank discussions about the troubled player who earlier this season set off fireworks in his bathroom with a group of friends , causing severe damage			2
the controversy continued with @entity3 gatecrashing new @entity47 boss @entity46 's first press conference late last month			1
the @entity49 player unexpectedly entered the press room as @entity46 was being formally unveiled as @entity52 's replacement			2
just days later he again aggravated the football world , being reportedly involved in a dressing - room row with @entity55 during second - placed @entity7 's 3 - 3 draw with @entity57			1
in the same game , in which he scored twice but was criticized for his performance , @entity3 also argued with teammate @entity61 over who should take a free - kick			1
" @entity55 -- that is totally false , " @entity12 said			1
" what happened with @entity61 on the pitch , that is a situation that can happen in difficult moments			0
" it is not good but i can understand this situation can happen			0
after the game it was finished			0
i am not worried -- it is important that after the game everything was okay			0
" then there was thursday 's car crash in @entity78			1
@entity3 , driving his @entity10 at the time , escaped unhurt , while a passenger from one of the other vehicles involved was taken to hospital as a precaution , according to police			2
with @entity3 's erratic antics continuing to grab headlines , @entity12 may be pressed to find an answer soon -- especially if he is to quell locker room bust - ups and his squad 's growing suspicions there is one rule for @entity3 and another for the rest			1
but despite the aggravation , @entity12 refuses to completely condemn the 21 - year - old @entity14			1
" because when you have a player like @entity3 you should always not talk bad things against him because he is your teammate			2
if you say something about him , it 's better to talk face - to - face , to say what you think , " he said			0
he can do some mistakes			0
he has paid for his mistake			0
i can understand ( why players are annoyed			0
but there are different ways to help guys like @entity3			2

" i would punch him in the head if we were teammates , " manager @entity12 says of @entity3
allegations of locker room bust - up between @entity55 and @entity3 during @entity57 match
controversy continues to follow @entity3 after he crashes his car in @entity78
@entity12 must now find answer to the " @entity3 problem " if he is to appease frustrated squad
