-- cold weather has delayed spring in @entity2 , but we can detect a clear warming trend in our politics			1
to be sure , the distance between the @entity8 administration and congressional republicans remains vast , executive and judicial nominations remain blocked by an unprecedented number of filibusters and major legislative accomplishments are still months away			2
but the ice of gridlock is starting to thaw			1
evidence of a healthier , more normal politics is beginning to reappear , centered in the @entity19 , our political institution that has declined the longest and the furthest			1
@entity21 has been in session only a few weeks , but the @entity19 has already passed its first budget in four years , after finding compromises to avoid the fiscal cliff and the " nuclear option			1
" across the range of tough issues , serious legislative work is moving forward , usually on a bipartisan basis			2
eight senators , led by @entity33 @entity32 and republicans @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , have made significant progress toward an agreement on immigration			1
the @entity40 has reported the first major gun control legislation since 1994 , though its fate is far from certain			0
democrat @entity43 , joined by @entity34 , released a devastating report on the abusive trading practices of @entity46			0
freshman democrats @entity47 and @entity49 have expressed similar views as have republicans @entity51 and @entity53 on the dangers of '' too big to fail " banks			0
democrat @entity56 , @entity58 chairman , and @entity52 @entity59 , @entity60 chairman , have accelerated their effort , started two years ago , to enact the first major tax reform legislation since 1986			2
the atmosphere is palpably better			0
president @entity8 's " charm offensive " on @entity67 won approval from many @entity52			0
sen. @entity68 of @entity69 , who after meeting with the president in 2010 , called him " thin - skinned " and recommended that he " take valium , " praised him generously this time around for the substantive meeting on the budget and related economic issues			2
senate minority leader @entity74 , who famously declared that defeating @entity8 was his highest priority , has this year shown much more graciousness , respect and even occasional humor			0
two factors are most responsible for the improvement			0
first , it turns out that elections do have consequences			0
@entity8 's decisive re-election , coupled with what amounted to a national landslide won by the @entity87 , has forced the @entity52 into a period of reassessment and repositioning			0
of course , some @entity52 still believe that their party lost because its right wing views were did not come through clearly enough			0
but most republicans recognize that the party 's combination of extremism and obstruction proved to be a losing strategy			0
they know the @entity52 brand is in deep trouble			0
the election results seemed to have convinced at least some of the @entity103 that finding areas in which to cooperate with the president is necessary			0
but the second factor , less understood than the impact of election returns , is just as important			0
by the end of 2012 , for many returning senators and those newly elected , dismay about the @entity19 has hardened into disgust and determination to change it			1
across the political spectrum , senators are fed up with lurching from crisis to crisis , leaders dictating straight party votes , endless filibusters and constant failure to address the nation 's problems			1
sen. @entity126 , @entity127 , compared the @entity19 to " the @entity128 ... an endless series of secret conclaves			1
. , with meetings everywhere but in the committee room or the open air of the @entity19 floor			1
" sen. @entity135 , @entity136 , took pride in the " zone of civility " created by the increasing number of women senators			2
sen. @entity32 , @entity146 - @entity145 , longingly " looked forward to the good old days when we had major legislation go through committees			2
" the shorthand for what the overwhelming number of senators want is " regular order " -- legislation that results from committee consideration , vigorous debate , the opportunity to offer amendments and hard bargaining to reach principled compromise -- and the @entity19 is changing as its leaders respond to the members ' frustration and anger			1
legislating in our diverse , contentious country , with our system of separation of powers , has never been , and will never be , easy			0
former sen. @entity167 once described the great @entity19 of the 1970s as " a kind of controlled madhouse			1
" the path to major legislative accomplishments is always treacherous and strewn with seemingly insurmountable obstacles			0
today , the partisan divide is much deeper and the political culture far more vitriolic than 20 or 30 years ago			1
although senators can not choose the era in which they serve , they can choose the way they approach their work and they can determine the way the @entity19 functions			1
it does n't take much time , or that many people , to change the @entity19			1
hopefully , day by day , that change is starting to happen			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 : @entity2 is seeing a *surprising* change in political *climate*
after years of gridlock , two parties making progress on issues such as immigration
he says much of the change is coming from members of the @entity19
@entity188 : senators want a return to days when @entity21 actually functioned
