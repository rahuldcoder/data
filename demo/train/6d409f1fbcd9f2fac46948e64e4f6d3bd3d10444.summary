-- if ever there was a place for ghost stories , it 's @entity5 -- the rugged peninsula of southwest @entity6 that tumbles into the @entity7			1
already remote , this often windswept corner was further isolated earlier this year when horrendous storms severed its only rail link , prompting round - the - clock efforts to reconnect it			1
so it seems only fitting that , when i visit the region , i do so in the company of a long - dead novelist , playwright and poet with a penchant for the paranormal			1
that 's not to say i 'm accompanied by a ghost as i make the five - hour rail journey from @entity26 's @entity25 , although a spectral @entity28 lady would be quite at home in the retro carriages of the @entity31 -- one of @entity34 's last intercity cabin trains			1
nevertheless , @entity35 , who died in 1935 at the age of 69 , is with me in spirit thanks to a vintage guidebook she penned while living on the north @entity5 coast			1
spooky novels published in 1911 , the stilted prose of " @entity42 " is a far cry from the exuberance of today 's travel guides , but the book 's claim that the region rewards repeat visits is enough to inspire my own return			1
my destination is " @entity52 , " the house that @entity54 lived in for several years , entertaining guests such as @entity6 playwright @entity56 , and drawing inspiration for spooky novels such as " @entity59			0
" a formidable literary presence , @entity54 also co-founded @entity61 , a pressure group that defends writers ' freedom of speech , and that was a staunch campaigner for women 's rights			1
i do n't linger at my first stop , @entity68 -- a party - loving gateway to the region 's many beaches -- jumping in a cab and heading north			1
fifteen minutes later i 'm at @entity75 ( @entity76 , @entity77 , +44 1637 861800 ) a luxury eco-hotel and spa with an enviable clifftop position overlooking the surfing beach of @entity77 and the epic 1,014 - kilometer @entity83 path , one of the world 's most spectacular oceanside hikes			1
the hotel 's welcoming , relaxed vibe leads into spa treatments in womb - like tents , green technology and paintings by local artists			1
' lovely and lonely ' next stop is @entity95 , a 10 - minute bus or car ride northeast along the coast			2
this wild and windswept arc of sand and rock pools is one of @entity34 's best surfing beaches and was once a favorite destination for @entity105			1
we 're in prime @entity54 territory here and , although the beach is thronged in summer with splashing families , the book says it 's a " lovely and lonely bay			2
" there are great walks in either direction -- to @entity115 , with its natural swimming pool , across an easy stretch of headland , or @entity119 and @entity120 which , despite the comedic name , is described by @entity54 as " somewhat eerie			1
" back in @entity95 , home for the next few nights is @entity123 ( from $ 1,389 per week ) , a stylish split - level beach retreat that touts itself as eco-friendly			2
after i settle in , @entity129 , a sailor whose parents built @entity127 , takes me over the lane to @entity52			0
@entity54 's old home , now owned by @entity129 's family , is set in lush and tropical gardens that feature a giant tree house			2
it feels like the haunt of a literary figurehead -- cozy , lived - in , casually elegant and adorned with family photographs			2
@entity129 tells me that sometimes he feels a presence in the house , often shutting doors at night only to later find them wide open			0
is it , we wonder , the ghost of @entity54 ? later we head to @entity147 , a working fishing port on the mouth of the @entity150			0
@entity54 describes this popular seaside town a " little place with narrow streets all running uphill , " which despite its exposure to the sea " still contrives to exist			0
" bitter / sweet no stranger to unhappy endings , @entity54 may have seen doom and destruction here -- " @entity59 " ends with a ghost - haunted murderer awaiting a soggy fate as waters rise around him in a coastal @entity5 cave			2
given that she wrote a guidebook to the region , it 's more likely she hoped for a thriving future			2
she would n't have been disappointed			0
these days @entity147 attracts hordes of foodies headed for local venues such as @entity175 ( @entity176 , @entity147 , +44 1841 520288 ) , a dining pub owned by cookery writer @entity177			0
the @entity179 - starred @entity178 at no. 6 , ( 6 middle st. , @entity147 , +44 01841 532093 ) is a converted 18th - century townhouse where i choose from a menu that includes @entity5 hake with saffron @entity184 , salmon with beetroot and sea emulsion			0
i finish with a @entity189 with doughnuts -- a perfect blend of bitter and sweet that matches the tone of @entity54 's travel writing			0
it 's a good moment to savor her verdict of @entity5			0
" there is so much to interest , so much to see -- almost too much it would seem , " she writes			0
" but @entity5 is a place to go to again and again , to go to till it seems as your own land			0
" perhaps , like the ghosts of her novels , she 's still around doing precisely that			0
@entity209 is a freelance journalist based in the @entity34			1
her writing has appeared in numerous web sites , newspapers and magazines .			0

with retro carriages , the @entity31 is one of @entity34 's last intercity cabin trains
@entity83 path is one of the world 's most spectacular ocean - side hikes
despite its comedic name , author @entity35 described @entity120 as " somewhat eerie "
