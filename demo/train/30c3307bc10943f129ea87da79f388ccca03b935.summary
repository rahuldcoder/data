-- the tech world has been up in arms this past week about " @entity3 , " an upcoming @entity5 reality show documenting the lives of five aspiring entrepreneurs making their way in the world of @entity11 startups			1
the tv show is co-produced by @entity13 , former marketing director of @entity14 and sister of its founder , @entity16			1
its brief preview showcases the glamorous life of a tech startup founder : lots of parties , alcohol , attractive women and a social scene that is like " high school , but it 's only the smart kids			1
" the problem : the tech industry is n't like that at all			1
here 's how tech - company founders usually succeed in @entity3 : they spend endless hours in front of a computer building products people want to use			1
alas , this does n't make for interesting tv			2
hence all the @entity38 cliches			0
computers on tv shows and in movies beep when a button is pressed			2
characters seem able to type at a frenetic pace			0
passwords can always be guessed within three attempts -- and always just in time to prevent a disaster			2
these cliches once existed only in fictional shows and movies			2
alas , as @entity3 continues to power a digital revolution that 's changing the world at a rapid pace , camera crews are increasingly trying to capture startup reality and bottle it as entertainment			1
and they 're finding it converts to film about as well as paint drying			0
@entity16 built @entity14 through thousands of hours spent in front of a dimly glowing screen			0
his motive ? he " likes to build things			0
" and yet in 2010 's " @entity64 , " the @entity16 onscreen is more concerned with girls , parties and getting into @entity68 's most exclusive social circles			2
therein lies the second issue with bringing startups to the big or small screen : startup founders rarely have interesting social lives			2
building a company takes almost every minute of the day , leaving little time for a personal life			1
tv viewers demand drama : if it ca n't be found , it 's manufactured			1
the small screen loves a performer , too			0
can you dance ? sing ? act ? even once the show is over , these outgoing stars convert well to a world of tabloids and celebrity magazines			0
startup founders , however , do not			0
so now comes the time to pick a side			0
is representing @entity3 as a party haven doing a disservice to those who work countless hours to build products we 'll all love ? or is there nobility in @entity13 's mission to " make accessible and to humanize the increasingly important tech community for the average consumer " ? perhaps it 's both			1
translating tech for those not living in its epicenter is a noble effort that will surely bring more new people -- and more diversity -- to @entity3			1
and yet this ca n't be done in a literal way : bringing technologists ' stories to tv and movies requires a little creativity to make the subject matter fit the medium			1
my science teacher did n't get our class interested in a science career by telling us that most chemists work long hours on repetitive tasks			0
no , he showed us explosions			0
and crazy , color - changing reactions			0
and non-newtonian fluids dancing on speaker cones			0
it 's unfortunate that the story of tech revolution does n't convert well to the dominant medium of the day			1
and it 's regrettable that some viewers will wildly misinterpret what entrepreneurship is all about			2
but after grabbing the attention of viewers with dramatic exothermic reactions -- or scenes of wild parties -- perhaps we 'll be able to teach them what it really takes to build a company			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

a @entity5 reality show , " @entity3 , " will follow five aspiring tech entrepreneurs
tv viewers demand drama : if it ca n't be found , it 's manufactured
bringing tech geeks ' stories to tv and movies will require some creativity to fit the medium
building a company takes almost every minute of the day , leaving little time for a personal life
