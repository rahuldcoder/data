-- the best and worst thing about @entity2 , the four - day mashup of geek and mainstream pop culture , is that the schedule is such an embarrassment of riches			1
what was once a haven for lovers of comics has expanded into a heaven for entertainment fans of all stripes , and this year 's @entity2 is no different			1
starting wednesday through sunday , july 21 , the @entity16 will be flooded with well over 100,000 attendees as they shuffle between panels promising exclusive previews and answers to fans ' burning questions			1
but unless the goal is to not sleep for four days -- which it might be for some -- having a plan of attack is crucial			0
even a con - goer flying high off a rush of adrenaline , caffeine and @entity33 sightings needs to prioritize			2
it was difficult , but we 've narrowed down the wealth of @entity2 to 15 events that we 're the most excited to see			1
that 's not to say there is n't plenty more to take in , as we also have our eyes peeled for " @entity41 " ; " @entity42 " ; @entity45 ' new @entity44 pilot , " @entity43 " ; " @entity46 " ; " @entity47 " ; and the first and only appearance of the " @entity50 " cast			1
but if you need a starting point , here are 15 events to highlight : ' @entity55 ' 20th anniversary @entity56 and @entity57 are staging an " x-files " reunion at @entity2 this year , marking the 20th anniversary since they first partnered as @entity62 and @entity63 on @entity44 's prime - time sci - fi series			1
writer - producers like @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , plus creator @entity70 , will be here as well			2
' @entity72 ' and ' divergent ' @entity73 brought the " @entity75 " masses to @entity2 in the past , but this year they 're arriving with fresh -- and pretty prestigious -- meat			1
@entity77 will join his " @entity72 " co-stars @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 for a q&a with fans , who 'll also get to see new footage of the november release			2
this panel will also offer a glimpse at another fan favorite adaptation , " divergent			0
" author @entity89 , whose best - selling young adult novel has spawned a series and a massive following , will be here to take fan questions , along with the movie 's stars , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 , among others			1
' @entity103 ' the stars of @entity105 's " @entity103 " will convene in @entity106 for one last comic - con appearance			1
@entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 will join the series ' executive producers to take fan questions about the eighth and final season , which began in june			0
' @entity116 ' the @entity118 - funded " @entity116 " movie just began filming , but @entity119 and the " @entity116 " crew already have some fun stuff to share with fans			2
several of the cast members will be here , including @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , plus @entity119			0
fans who get into this chat will get to ask questions , learn details about the production and see footage from the film			2
' @entity139 ' the only glitch for " @entity46 " fans is that the show 's panel overlaps with the first look at @entity33 's upcoming @entity146 series , " @entity139 " we 've had a small taste of what 's to come with a trailer , but additional " top secret information " plus surprise guests are on the bill for the comic - con panel			1
' @entity155 ' fans will have an opportunity to get the scoop on the fourth season , which will begin filming this summer			2
expect to see @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and more			0
' @entity163 ' @entity165 and @entity164 are rolling out previews of four upcoming films , not the least of which is @entity169 's " @entity163			0
" with @entity171 joining @entity172 and @entity173 in the sequel -- in which the @entity176 winner takes on the role of the villainous @entity178 -- we ca n't wait to see what sneak peeks will come out of @entity2			1
the other @entity181 previews are " @entity182 , " " the @entity183 : @entity184 , " and the remake of " @entity186 " -- with @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
' @entity190 ' if you 've yet to become acquainted with the name @entity193 , now would be the time to do so -- especially ahead of awards season			0
the star of @entity197 's " @entity190 " is raking in the critical acclaim			0
fans who are taken with this suspenseful series , about an orphan ( @entity193 ) who takes on the identity of her look - alike after witnessing the woman 's suicide , will get to ask questions about the addictive first season			1
' @entity208 , ' ' 300 : @entity209 , ' ' gravity ' @entity212 ' panel will feature @entity214 ' " @entity213 " ; " the @entity215 " ; " 300 : @entity209 " ; the @entity217 and @entity218 space thriller " gravity " ; and a do - not - skip preview of @entity221 ' " @entity208			0
" ' @entity222 : catching @entity223 ' this panel will also put a spotlight on @entity226 and @entity227 in " i , @entity228 , " but we 're betting all eyes will be trained on what 's in store for " @entity222 : catching @entity223			0
" it 'll be the first time the franchise appears at @entity2 , and fans can anticipate a look at new scenes , plus a q&a			1
' @entity240 , ' ' @entity241 ' we know that @entity44 is going to feature " @entity240 " and " @entity241 , " but we 're more curious if the crew from " x-men : @entity245 " will be there as well			0
going to the @entity2 ? share your mini-interviews of interesting people and you could see them on @entity0 ' @entity250 : @entity251 , ' ' captain america : the winter soldier ' @entity255 head @entity254 is going to satisfy the fandom 's thirst for glimpses of this year 's " thor : @entity251 " and 2014 's " captain america : the winter soldier			1
" " surprise " special guests are in store , so our fingers are crossed for double @entity70 action : " @entity270 " @entity268 and " @entity260 's " @entity269			0
' @entity271 ' along with " @entity103 , " @entity2 is also giving @entity275 's " @entity271 " one final panel in honor of its last season			1
@entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and more stars will join creator @entity68 to talk about filming those final eight episodes			0
there 'll be an opportunity to ask questions , of course , and fans will get to see a sneak peek at the final episodes of season 5 ahead of the august 11 premiere			2
50th anniversary of ' @entity291 ' @entity292 is no longer " @entity291 , " but he will be at @entity2 to celebrate the 50th anniversary special with @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity297			2
it 's unlikely that we 'll also learn who the new " doctor " will be , but we can hope			0
' community ' : celebrating the fans given that it 's the fandom that has truly held " community " afloat on @entity305 for the past four seasons , we appreciate that the fans are getting their due this year -- even if it 's only in the panel title			1
@entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 and @entity315 will be at the panel , along with reinstated executive producer @entity317			0
