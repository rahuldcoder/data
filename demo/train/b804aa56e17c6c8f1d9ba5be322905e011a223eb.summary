the anti-apartheid message was serious and heartfelt , but the song that alerted many around the world to the injustices of the @entity6 regime could not have been more upbeat			1
" @entity13 " by @entity14 was a @entity7 hit in the @entity8 in 1984 , and it instantly became the unofficial anthem and slogan for the international anti-apartheid movement			1
the song 's eponymous subject rose to prominence in the 1950s as a radical young member of the @entity19 , the main opposition movement to the segregationist @entity6 government			1
as an advocate of guerrilla attacks , @entity13 was frequently arrested and eventually convicted in 1964 , along with other @entity19 leaders , for sabotage			1
he received a life prison sentence , and spent 27 years in a cell , mostly on @entity27 , off the @entity6 coast			1
while @entity13 languished in jail , an anti-apartheid movement slowly developed in the @entity31 , starting with sporting sanctions against @entity6 and later an artists ' boycott of performances in the country			1
the writer of " @entity13 , " @entity37 -- the founder of the multiracial @entity38 ska - punk band @entity14 , later renamed the @entity14 -- admits he knew little about @entity13 before he attended an anti-apartheid concert in @entity41 in 1983			1
that concert gave him the idea for the song			0
" i 'd never actually heard of @entity13 , although i knew a lot about the anti-apartheid movement and he was becoming a figurehead for the whole movement , " @entity37 told @entity45			1
the keyboardist , who also wrote " @entity51 , " the seminal specials song against the policies of @entity55 's prime minister at the time , @entity54 , may not have known much about the imprisoned anti-apartheid figurehead , but his lyrics brought @entity13 's struggle to the attention of a wider audience			1
the song 's relentlessly upbeat feel certainly helped push it up the charts			0
" it ends with the thing of ' i 'm begging you ' and then ' i 'm telling you , ' " @entity37 said			1
" it is a demand but in a positive way , it brought some sort of hope that the situation could be sorted out			0
" some of the lyrics : @entity13 21 years in captivity shoes too small to fit his feet his body abused but his mind is still free are you so blind that you can not see ? i said ... @entity13 , i 'm begging you @entity13 veteran @entity84 and broadcaster @entity85 said the song was effective in educating people about @entity13 , whose reputation was low in the @entity31 at the time			1
" now we have this sainted vision of @entity13 , but at the time @entity54 treated him as a terrorist			1
so to release a record about someone whom your @entity95 considers a terrorist is quite brave			0
" the song helped to change perceptions about @entity13 , according to @entity85 , a presenter on leading @entity8 station @entity101			2
" it did educate people about apartheid an incredible amount , because they certainly were n't going to learn about @entity13 from conventional sources			2
the word on him from on high was very bad , so it was up to musicians to take a leading role in rehabilitating his reputation			0
" " @entity13 " was also an extremely effective protest song , he added , a view echoed in 2010 by left - leaning current affairs magazine @entity116 , which included it in a list of the top 20 political anthems of all time			2
" ' @entity13 ' was effective for two reasons , " @entity85 said			2
" it 's a good pop record in that it 's catchy and sounds good			0
and you immediately know what it 's about , because the first three words are ' @entity13			2
' and secondly , it had a clear message that the audience agreed with			0
" and the fact that @entity14 were at the time a " top 10 band " meant the audience took note			2
" if the @entity14 say it , there must be something to it , " as @entity85 noted			2
four years later , in 1988 , @entity138 and the band @entity139 helped organize the @entity13 70th birthday concert at @entity41 's @entity141 , featuring acts such as @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			1
@entity146 played " @entity151 " about another anti-apartheid activist , while @entity148 performed his influential song " @entity150			0
" the event was watched by a global television audience of 600 million and is credited with hardening popular opposition internationally to the apartheid regime			0
@entity85 is proud of his contribution to the event , for which he was one of the tv presenters			0
" the concert was an incredible success , " he said			0
" it had the biggest tv audience to date , and put @entity13 in topic a position around the world			2
but it might never have happened without the song ' @entity13 , ' because this inspired some of the artists who appeared at @entity141 to be there			0
" as the impact of the concert rippled around the world , the @entity6 government was secretly holding talks with @entity13			1
these meetings culminated in his release on february 11 , 1990			0
four years later , he succeeded @entity177 to become the republic 's first black president			0
@entity13 never forgot the debt he owed to supporters in the @entity8			0
in 1996 he used a speech to both houses of @entity184 in @entity41 to give his thanks : " we take this opportunity once more to pay tribute to the millions of @entity8 who , through the years , stood up to say : no to apartheid ! " in 2008 , singer @entity190 joined @entity37 for the finale to a concert in @entity41 's @entity193 marking @entity13 's 90th birthday			1
the song 's message had long since been realized -- and indeed the by - then - frail elder statesman appeared onstage -- but it was received as warmly as ever .			0
