it was three years ago that people across the nation and around the world held their breath			1
after a two - month trial , the jury in the @entity7 murder trial announced they had arrived at a verdict			1
@entity10 was found not guilty of first - degree murder and the other most serious charges against her in the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter			1
the nation was first introduced to @entity7 in july 2008			1
the country fell in love with her precious daughter , @entity7 , who had gone missing in @entity21 , @entity22			1
a massive missing persons search for the little girl ensued			1
police were suspicious of what @entity10 , then 22 , was telling them			1
she lied about her nanny taking the child			1
she lied about working at @entity31			1
@entity10 suddenly became the most hated woman in @entity33			1
on july 16 , 2008 , @entity10 was arrested on suspicion of child neglect			1
her attorney was an unknown @entity22 lawyer named @entity37			1
a @entity22 grand jury indicted @entity10 on capital murder charges october 14 , 2008			1
a utility worker found @entity7 's skeletal remains in a wooded area near the @entity10 home in december 2008 , and several months later , prosecutors announced they would seek the death penalty			1
@entity22 v. @entity7 : a look back at evidence and testimony watching in the wings was another @entity22 lawyer , @entity49			1
a former president of the @entity22 @entity51 , @entity49 , who just that year had been selected by @entity53 as one of @entity22 's top lawyers , was disgusted with the local media coverage about the relatively inexperienced @entity37			1
" i was offended by it			1
i was offended by the fact that he was n't being treated fairly			1
i did n't know @entity37			1
i had never met him , " @entity49 said			1
@entity37 started asking @entity49 , a @entity22 death penalty qualified attorney , for advice			1
that propelled @entity49 to want to meet @entity10			1
he remembers going to the @entity65 jail to introduce himself			1
" they brought her to the room , and i have to tell you i was really surprised to see how small she is ... how tiny she is			1
i stood looking at a child herself			1
i said this ca n't be , " he said			1
i sat down with @entity49 exclusively to talk with him about his new book , " justice in @entity33			1
" in it , he insists that the jury got it right , and the rest of the country had it wrong			1
" could she look you in the eye ? " i asked			2
" oh yes , " @entity49 responded , describing her demeanor as quiet , afraid and unsure			2
after that meeting , with @entity10 's approval , @entity49 decided to join the team pro bono			2
he said the unpaid time he spent on the case " was well over a million dollars " and cost him tens of thousands of dollars out - of - pocket			2
@entity49 said in the years before trial , he normally met with @entity10 in a lunch room at the jail			1
the jail would clear everyone out before @entity10 came in			2
a stationary video camera in the room was positioned on their conversations , so he and @entity10 would cover their mouths and speak in low tones to each other , @entity49 said			2
shortly before jury selection was to begin , @entity49 got word that @entity10 's handwritten letters describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father were going to be made public under @entity22 's open records law			1
he believed it was only right that @entity10 's parents , @entity115 and @entity116 , were warned			2
he called them to his office late on a friday afternoon			2
" we had them one at a time come into my personal office and made the announcement : ' monday 's going to be a bad day for you @entity115			2
i felt man to man i would tell you in advance			2
" " @entity49 said @entity10 's reaction was " basically none			2
" " he looked at me ... i turned sideways a little bit , he clapped his hands down on his thighs -- let out a big sigh but did n't say anything , " @entity49 said			2
" he never admitted doing anything , " @entity49 said			2
" all we had were the letters and ( separately ) the statements @entity139 had made to the psychiatrist			2
" next it was @entity7 's turn			1
" we called @entity143 in , @entity116 , and told her and she immediately welled up with emotion , cried , was very upset , " @entity49 said			2
once a jury was selected it was time for the evidentiary portion of the trial			2
@entity37 gave the opening statements			2
in the midst of telling the jury what the evidence would show , he delivered a bombshell that turned the case on its head by telling the jury that his client was a victim of sexual abuse by her father			2
the country was stunned and so was @entity49 , who was sitting next to @entity10 in the courtroom			2
" i did n't know that he was going to say that			2
we had talked about all aspects of it , and i did not know			2
i do n't know if anybody knew that he was going to say that other than himself , " @entity49 recalled			0
i asked @entity49 if he was concerned the defense would not be able to establish this with evidence as promised during the opening statement			0
" yes , i was concerned about that because i knew we did n't have the ability to prove that unless @entity115 got on the stand and confessed , " he said			0
the prosecution responded by making @entity10 its first witness			0
the first question assistant state attorney @entity182 asked him was whether he had sexually abused his daughter			0
@entity10 responded with a definitive no. the trial went on for weeks			0
witness after witness took the stand for the prosecution in the largely circumstantial case			0
they finally rested their case on june 15 , 2011			1
then it was the defense 's turn			0
@entity10 's defense attorneys maintained that @entity7 was not murdered at all			1
they said the child drowned in the @entity10 's above - ground pool , and that @entity7 and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death			1
@entity10 denied that in his testimony			0
@entity7 : ' i did n't kill my daughter ' in the midst of the defense case , @entity49 described how out - of - court conversations with the prosecution suddenly turned to possible plea discussions			1
@entity10 was approached with the possibility			0
" @entity139 got very angry about that			0
she got very angry to hear talk about it			0
she did n't want to hear it			0
" @entity139 would fight it ' til her last breath			0
she did n't kill her daughter			0
" @entity49 said he believes it took a lot of courage and strength for @entity10 to end any talk of a plea agreement			0
she knew what was at stake in this death penalty trial			0
so , plea discussions were stopped in their tracks , @entity49 said , and the trial went on			0
then , on july 5 , 2011 , after deliberating for 10 hours , jurors announced they had reached a verdict			1
" she was holding her breath like a deep sea diver , waiting as we all were , " @entity49 said			0
@entity10 was acquitted by the 12 - person jury on the most serious charges , including first - degree murder , aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child			0
but the jury convicted her on four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers			0
@entity10 now lives in an undisclosed location in @entity22 and does n't go out of the home she is living in because of the public hate and continued threats to her life , @entity49 said			1
" she has to live constantly on guard			0
she ca n't go out in public , " @entity49 said			1
by her own choice , she works inside the home , @entity49 said , and is living as " a housekeeper , clerk , secretary and stuff like that			0
" " i think @entity139 has a lot of world left to have to deal with			0
she has n't been freed from her incarceration yet ' cause she ca n't go out			0
she ca n't go to a beauty parlor , she ca n't go shopping to a department store , she ca n't go to a restaurant , she ca n't even go to @entity269 's			0
she ca n't do anything , " he said			0
@entity49 and his wife , @entity272 , have continued a relationship with @entity10			0
now three years after being acquitted , @entity49 said @entity10 still distrusts the outside world			1
" @entity139 is aloof , " @entity49 said			0
" she is kind of , i think , afraid of people ... she 's not real close to			0
we 've had a couple of occasions to have social gatherings that can include her -- close friends , the ( legal ) team			0
she still likes to back away from the middle			0
" 2012 : @entity10 's ' video diary ' surfaces @entity10 " does not have any blood family anymore , " @entity49 said			0
the family she has is the residual of the defense team , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity49 's wife			0
@entity49 said although there may have been a few conversations between @entity10 and her mother in recent years , there is no relationship			1
and as for a relationship with her father ? " none , " @entity49 said emphatically			0
@entity304 has also gotten to know @entity10 over the past three years			1
" i 'm a cross between a friend , a mother , but not a mother -- only someone who is older who has had experience in the world she has not had , " she said			0
@entity49 gives @entity10 advice , but also listens to her when they talk			0
" my hope for her is it gets better for her and the world or the people who have been so hateful can let that go and they can move on , " she said			0
@entity10 " tries to make her life work , " @entity304 said			0
she takes care of herself and stays physically fit by working out in the house			0
" i do think she wants to speak out , " @entity49 said			0
@entity10 declined @entity328 's request for an interview			0
" i have never asked her that , but i know she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her			0
i also know she 's very saddened by her loss and she will never forget her daughter @entity7 , ever			1
