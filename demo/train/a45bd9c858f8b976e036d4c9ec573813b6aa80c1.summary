-- it 's being billed as " @entity2 for adults " and could mean your fondness for construction toys may no longer be just a guilty pleasure			1
the new robotics kit created by @entity10 - based @entity9 provides all you need to relive your childhood , with nearly 100 @entity2 - compatible mechanical and electronic components			1
but this time around you 're building robots for real , assembling modules that can create walking spider robots , beverage bots , or even your very own @entity18 - @entity17 " @entity20 is an aluminum version of @entity2 bricks , " explains @entity9 founder @entity19			1
" like @entity2 , parts can connect to each other easily and flexibly , but you do n't need nuts to make the connections , since we have a clever threaded slot design			1
" all the pieces slot together in a construction process designed to be easy and intuitive , says @entity19			2
" we 've done some work to make the electronics and software more friendly to beginners			0
we use uniform modular connectors with color tags to help you make the right connections , and we plan to have a smartphone app to let beginners interact with their robots without any programming			0

" as children , @entity2 taught us to follow rules , but also to discard them , " says @entity52 , who has written about the psychology of @entity2			1
" @entity2 is a simple , uniform , non-representational material that can be transformed into the most complex , individual objects representing the wildest of fantasy worlds			1
" the fantasy world of play is increasingly being harnessed in education across the board , not just in robotics , says @entity66 , founder of @entity67 , an organization that seeks to aid education through " gamification			1
" " there 's a growing belief that play may be tied to learning -- but it 's wrong			1
play is learning , " says @entity66			2
" play provides a safe environment which embraces trial and error , eliminating fear of failure and encouraging experimentation , which leads to greater understanding of how things work and greater confidence in one 's ability to confront challenges			2
" makeblock appeals to this sense of creativity , but it 's not just analogous to @entity2 , it is @entity2 - compatible , says @entity19			1
" the basic hole distance in our platform is the same as the basic dimensions in @entity2 , both are 8 mm , so it 's possible to attach @entity2 blocks to @entity20 parts			2
@entity20 is an open platform , compatible with many other parts and systems , we do n't put any limit on people 's imagination , " @entity19 says			0

customers will also get additional technical support from the community and other resources such as code			0
" building robots is a creative process that should be accessible to everyone , he adds			0
" our goal is to help people turn their ideas into reality , help them to be more creative			0
@entity128 is no longer something that just the geeks can do , but also people without professional backgrounds , " says @entity19			0
despite having a masters degree in aircraft design and being a diy and robotics enthusiast , even @entity19 found available robotics kits difficult to follow			0
he was also unimpressed with their flimsy design			0

@entity19 resolved to make his own kits , with solid design and an open - source philosophy			1
" i wanted to create a platform that is strong , flexible and practical , for people to turn their ideas into success , to build some real things			0
" @entity19 believes open - source hardware will follow the popularity of open - source software , as people want to create more physical things			1
" the hardware era is coming now			0
people live in the real physical world , not in the digital world			0
the popularity of 3d printers is an example of this , " he says			0
@entity19 's kits provide all the components you need to jump - start your home robotics career			2
whether you want to build a mini tank or a 3d printer of your own , @entity20 has the parts and just like with @entity2 , your imagination does the rest .			2

new robotics kit billed as " @entity2 for adults " gives grown - ups the chance to relive youth using 21st century *technology*
creator of @entity187 says open source hardware is the future of the ' maker ' *revolution*
construction toys appeal to adults as well as children , and play is *fundamental* to learning , say experts
