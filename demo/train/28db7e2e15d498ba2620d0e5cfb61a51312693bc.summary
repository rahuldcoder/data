@entity0 -- @entity3 engineers found an electronic software problem that caused " sudden unintended acceleration " in a test vehicle during pre-production trials , according to a company engineering document obtained by and translated for @entity1			1
the 2006 document , marked " confidential , " recounted the results of an adaptive cruise - control software test in a model internally designated the @entity13 , a vehicle later sold as the @entity15 in @entity16 and @entity17			1
the document says a " fail - safe overhaul " would be needed for another model in production , internally designated the @entity21 , which the company says was later sold as a @entity23			2
@entity3 insists that the document shows no such thing , and it continues to deny that any sudden unintended acceleration in any of its vehicles was caused by electronic systems			1
but three translations of the report , including two commissioned by @entity1 after @entity3 's objections , found that engineers raised concerns that the adaptive cruise control system would start the car moving forward on its own			1
read the original document and @entity39 translations here " the cruise control activates by itself at full throttle when the accelerator pedal position sensor is abnormal , " states the document , written in @entity16 , translated into @entity39			1
software glitches were an early suspect in the rash of reports of sudden , unintended accelerations reported in @entity3 vehicles in 2010 , some of which caused severe accidents and several fatalities			1
but both @entity3 and the @entity54 concluded that electronics were not at fault , instead blaming bad floor mats , sticky accelerator pedals and , in some cases , driver error			1
@entity3 has never conceded that an electronics or software problem could be responsible in any way for sudden acceleration in its cars and trucks			1
" this looks like an example of electronics causing a car to suddenly accelerate , " said @entity67 , director of the @entity68 at the @entity69			0
@entity67 , a mechanical engineering professor , was assigned to look into the sudden acceleration of @entity3 vehicles as a consultant for @entity75			1
he said the document should have been included in any investigation , and he questioned why it was n't shared with the @entity54 , @entity79 -- which assisted the highway safety agency 's review -- and @entity75			0
@entity3 said it did not share the document with the @entity54 because " the test and the document had nothing to do with unintended acceleration , or a defect , or a safety flaw of any kind			1
" @entity3 electrical engineer @entity90 said the sequence described in the test memo " takes place in a fraction of a second			1
" " this is a case where the vehicle is under test , " said @entity90 , a manager at the @entity96 near @entity97 , @entity98			0
" again , we input an abnormal signal			0
the vehicle reacts appropriately to that signal and releases the brake , just as we would expect it to do and want it to do			0
this has nothing to do with sudden unintended acceleration at all			0
" @entity3 says that the test vehicle " did not physically move forward " and that the experiment led to " an adjustment and refinement " of the cruise control before it went into production			1
the issue has never occurred in any @entity3 vehicle sold , the company said			1
the company says the document was meant to alert other engineers to the pre-production problem , so lessons learned could be shared			0
neither the test vehicle nor the adaptive cruise - control system cited in the document have been sold in the @entity126 , @entity3 said			1
the engineering document was originally provided to @entity1 in @entity16 , with an @entity39 translation ( @entity129 )			0
when @entity3 complained about what it said were inaccuracies in the original translation ( @entity129 ) , @entity1 retained a @entity134 - based translation house with expertise in automotive and technical matters to independently retranslate the document			2
that translation backed up the first , finding that @entity3 engineers recorded a " sudden unintended acceleration " in the @entity13 's adaptive cruise control , which was designed to slow the vehicle if sensors detected an object ahead and accelerate the vehicle when the obstacle clears			1
but @entity3 again said the translation was inaccurate ( @entity129 )			0
" the exact translation is not ' sudden unintended acceleration , ' " said @entity90 , who does not speak @entity16			0
" this is a test referring to adaptive cruise control , so the literal translation is , ' it can begin or start by itself , ' which is consistent with what you would expect from a cruise control , or in this case , an adaptive cruise control system			1
" when @entity3 argued that both translations were in error , @entity1 commissioned a third translation ( @entity129 ) by another firm in the @entity126 with expertise in automotive and engineering translations			0
according to the third translation , @entity3 's engineers stated that a test was conducted on the @entity21 " to prevent the accelerator malfunction that caused the vehicle to accelerate on its own " in an earlier test of the @entity13			2
despite multiple requests , @entity3 did not provide its own translation of the document			0
@entity175 , an independent automobile safety engineer based in @entity177 , examined all three translations of the document at @entity1 's request and concluded that in 2006 , @entity3 did in fact have an electronics issue			2
" this is a tangible , repeatable , fixable issue that they 've identified in this vehicle , " @entity175 said			0
" it 's related to software issues , which is something @entity3 has said is infallible in their systems			2
" another analyst who reviewed all three translations , @entity189 , reached a similar conclusion			0
" what the memo tells me is that there was an electronic problem that caused unintended acceleration in an earlier - model @entity15 -- the 250 -- and they wanted to avoid the same problem occurring in the 180 , " said @entity189 , the executive director of the @entity192 , a watchdog group founded by @entity193			2
" and they identified a failure mode			0
" but @entity3 officials said that in this instance , engineers " intentionally and artificially produced an inappropriate sensor signal as a test of the electronic failsafe system			1
" @entity3 said that the test " merely identified an unacceptable electronic sensor sensitivity threshold " and that the vehicle did not physically move during the test			2
@entity3 spokesman @entity213 emphasized that the problem was fixed before the vehicle was put into production			2
he called the document obtained by @entity1 " evidence of @entity3 's robust design process			0
" in a letter to @entity1 , @entity3 said , " it is ironic and disheartening that a document that is actually evidence of @entity3 's robust vehicle design and pre-production testing to ensure safety is the apparent centerpiece for @entity1 's broadcast			0
" read the full letter ( @entity129 ) the @entity3 and @entity54 conclusions on the cause of the 2010 rash of unintended acceleration problems in the @entity126 were backed up by the @entity232 , an arm of the @entity234			2
in a january 18 report , the research council called those findings legitimate but warned that the @entity54 could face difficulties in examining increasingly complicated electronic systems unless it adds more electronics expertise to investigation teams			0
in 2011 , motorists reported 331 incidents of sudden acceleration to the @entity54 , according to data compiled by @entity246 , a consulting firm that has in the past advised consumers who have filed lawsuits against @entity3			1
@entity246 has recently filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking documents and videos of one such incident , in a @entity256 .			0

translated @entity3 report describes a cruise - control system test
experts say the translated report describes a software problem
the company denies electronics are responsible for sudden acceleration
