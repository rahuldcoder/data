-- @entity1 will start the first ever @entity3 @entity2 in pole position after coming out on top in saturday 's tense qualifying session			1
the @entity8 driver has been on dazzling form in recent weeks , winning consecutive races in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 to climb atop the overall driver 's standings , and his hot streak continued in the @entity18 resort town of @entity19			1
@entity1 clocked a fastest lap of one minute , 38.338 seconds but was made to sweat by the @entity22 of @entity23 who looked set to trump that time only to skid off at the very end of the third qualifying run			1
the slip ensured the @entity27 finished third fastest behind @entity1 's teammate and title rival @entity28			1
@entity31 's @entity30 will begin the race from fourth position ahead of the @entity34 of home favourite @entity35 who edged out @entity38 of @entity31 and @entity39 of @entity40			1
" @entity43 is a great place to start , " @entity1 told the waiting press after coming off the track			1
" it was n't the easiest of sessions			0
@entity28 and @entity23 were looking quite strong and hooking up a good lap was n't the same as practice			1
it will be tough tomorrow in the race			0
it is a long way down to turn one			0
we 'll see how that works out			0
" elsewhere on the track , @entity57 clocked the eighth fastest time just ahead of @entity60 teammate @entity59			2
four - time world champion @entity61 , meanwhile , will start in eleventh position after failing to make the final qualifying run			2
" i was n't comfortable in the car today			0
it was very difficult , " @entity61 said			0
" the car felt nervous , so i could n't take the speed into the corners , i lost the rear many times around the lap and therefore was n't quick enough			0
" the day 's qualifying took place under calm , sunny conditions that were in stark contrast to the heavy rain a week earlier in @entity13 that led to @entity77 driver @entity76 suffering a severe head injury			1
the 25 - year - old @entity79 remains in hospital in @entity81 and a number of drivers spoke earlier this week about the difficulty of competing again so soon after such a traumatic incident			2
@entity1 said he was praying for the @entity79 while all 21 drivers have put the words " @entity88 # 17 " on their helmets this weekend to show their support			1
@entity76 's @entity77 teammate , @entity91 , took to the track saturday but finished the day in 21st position and will start last on the grid sunday			1
he later described the emotions he and his team felt and the difficulties of trying to focus on racing under the circumstances			0
" ( it 's been ) a tough weekend and one that has n't got any easier as we 've progressed towards the race , " @entity91 said			0
" i 'm grateful for having the whole team around me as i think that it is helping all of us to focus			0
" performance-wise , we did n't get the qualifying position we wanted today , but there are some reasons for that			2
" we 'll keep pushing hard this evening , and do our best to get ahead of the @entity110 tomorrow , but the fact is , it 's not the same without my teammate			2
