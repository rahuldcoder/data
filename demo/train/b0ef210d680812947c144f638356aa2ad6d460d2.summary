-- some people just are n't hardwired for the traditional workplace			2
if you get bored easily , have many interests , like to take risks and prefer to make your own rules , then you may be one of them			2
so what 's an unconventional worker like you to do ? well , you can either suffer through decades of being someone 's employee , unfulfilled and bored , or you can take a risk and create your own path to success by working for yourself			1
@entity15 , an entrepreneur , businessman and actor ( famous for his roles on television series like " @entity20 " and " @entity21 " ) did just that			1
in a career that epitomizes the word " unconventional , " @entity15 has been involved in everything from the wine - making and bridal businesses , to acting on stage and owning a film - distribution company			1
in his new book " @entity29 : a @entity36 to @entity37 , " @entity15 details how he was able to triumph in such a wide variety of business endeavors , all of which were independent pursuits			1
here are some of his top tips for finding success through working independently , as discussed in his book : 1			1
do n't limit yourself : many people believe that because their educational background or work experience lends itself to a particular field , that their career choices must lay within that field			0
not so , says @entity15			1
" this will surprise you , but the common thread to the various businesses in which i have been involved is that i had never previously been in them			0
" while many would see a lack of experience as a deterrent to entering a particular business , @entity15 saw it as a benefit			1
" it was an advantage that i had no rules to follow , no premade decisions , no ' books ' to tell me how to find success			1
this allowed me to take a creative approach rather than an administrative approach , " he says			0
" it is my belief that the best results in business come from a creative process , from the ability to see things differently from everyone else , and from finding answers to problems that are not bound by the phrase ' we have always done it this way			0
get comfortable with " red tape : " these days , even small businesses are subject to a variety of federal , state and local regulations , so if you want to start your own , these regulations should be learned and lived by			0
" your ability to comply with the blizzard of paperwork and reports required by various rules that come down from @entity94 , your state capital or your local zoning board may mean the difference between success and failure , " @entity15 says			1
remember that bigger is not better : fight the urge to make growth and size the overarching goals of your business			1
" size is not efficient , " @entity15 says			1
" not that long ago , there were several automobile manufacturers , including @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
they had to compete with one another			0
was it difficult ? yes , but it led to innovation			0
" by contrast , he says , today 's @entity121 automakers -- @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 -- have become complacent with their products ; so much so that they were overtaken by foreign competitors and forced into their respective financial crises			0
keep your business small , and you keep your business innovative , he says			0
work with good people : choose the people you bring into your business wisely , @entity15 says			2
" @entity139 partners and associates you trust and have them trust you			1
both of these processes will almost certainly affect the outcome of what you are doing , " he says			0
" picking whom to trust ... is based on using your instinct , observing people 's behavior and judging the consequences of their actions			2
" in addition to being trustworthy , your business partners and employees should also share your mindset			2
" i have found that it is always easier for me to understand someone who operates outside the mainstream and who looks at things differently from others in his field , " @entity15 says			2
