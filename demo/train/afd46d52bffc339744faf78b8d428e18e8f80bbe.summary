-- people have the " right to be forgotten " and search engines like @entity6 must remove certain unwanted links , @entity2 's top court decided in a surprise ruling tuesday			1
the case , which spotlighted the clash between privacy and freedom of information advocates , centered on a @entity15 man 's efforts to remove historic links to his debt problems			2
in its decision , the @entity18 found operators of search engines such as @entity6 were the " controller " of information			1
they were therefore responsible for removing unwanted links if requested			1
" an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties , " the judges said in a statement about the ruling			1
a @entity6 spokesman , in an email to @entity0 , said the ruling was " disappointing , " and that the company needed time to " analyze the implications			1
" @entity6 had previously argued it was only hosting the data and said it was up to the individual websites to remove the data			1
the decision came as a surprise to the industry and legal experts , as it ran contrary to the court 's @entity48 opinion , whose guidance is usually followed			0
" for @entity6 , this result creates a headache -- and potentially huge costs , " @entity53 @entity52 lecturer @entity51 said			2
" the ruling looks like a strong decision in favor of privacy and individual rights -- and against the business models of search engines , and certain aspects of freedom of speech			2
" the case arose in 2010 , when @entity67 complained to the @entity68 about an old newspaper notice detailing his social security debts			0
the advertisement was placed in a @entity15 newspaper by the @entity73 in 1998			0
it detailed a property auction being held to recover the debts			0
@entity67 argued that he had long resolved his debts and the information was no longer relevant			0
he complained that details about his old debts were coming up in @entity6 search results , which he said violated his data protection rights			1
the @entity15 privacy watchdog rejected the complaint against the newspaper , saying it was right to publish the information at the time of the auction			0
however , it also said that @entity6 had no right to spread the news about @entity67 further and ruled that the search engine must remove the link from the list of results			1
@entity6 challenged the ruling with the @entity15 @entity98 which referred the case up to @entity101 's top court			1
international watchdog @entity102 said the ruling " violates the fundamental principles of freedom of expression			0
" " it allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight			0
this is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books			0
" @entity102 said in a statement			0
