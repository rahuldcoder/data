-- @entity2 president @entity1 restated his country 's support for debt - stricken @entity5 saturday , but stressed that it must live up to its reform commitments			1
@entity1 spoke alongside @entity5 prime minister @entity9 in @entity10 , following the first meeting between the two leaders since their respective elections this summer			1
@entity1 said there was " no question " that @entity5 should remain in the eurozone , the 17 - nation single currency area , and that two - and - a - half years of speculation over its potential exit should end			1
but , he said , @entity5 has to meet its reform targets			1
" @entity5 must stay in the eurozone and then again demonstrate credibility in its program , as well as the will of its leaders to get through this process and to make sure it is bearable for its people , " he said			1
@entity1 also recognized the efforts already made by @entity5 , whose people have had to endure painful austerity measures and five years of recession			1
@entity9 , elected three months ago , is on a two - day visit to @entity35 and @entity2 as he seeks to negotiate some breathing room for his debt - burdened government			1
the meeting with @entity1 had been a chance to discuss " the big threats , the big challenges but also the common prospects that @entity44 is facing , " @entity9 said			1
he reiterated his government 's resolve to take the steps needed to keep @entity5 afloat			2
" there are those who are speculating that @entity5 will not make it			2
i am here to reassure the @entity2 president that @entity5 is , today , determined to make it			2
and will make it , " he said			0
" it will do what it takes to get out of the crisis and will remain , as the @entity2 president also said , in the eurozone and once again find its rightful role in @entity44			2
" success by @entity5 will help show that @entity44 can " overcome its problems and , united , go forward , " he said			0
@entity9 agreed that structural reforms were needed but stressed too the importance of development , saying that without it the economy would struggle to recover from recession			0
he added that the @entity5 are a proud people , who " do n't like to borrow and depend on borrowed money , " a point he also made after his talks with @entity35 chancellor @entity72 friday			0
@entity5 's international lenders , known as the troika , are due to complete a report on the country 's finances next month , on which rests @entity79 ' continued access to international bailout funds			2
@entity5 has been at the center of @entity44 's long - running debt crisis , which is now threatening to envelop @entity83 and @entity84 and has shaken the global financial system			1
even after a historic restructuring in march , @entity5 is still struggling to cope with a punishing debt load as its economy remains mired in a years - long recession			1
many investors and economists believe there is at least a 50 % chance that @entity5 will leave the currency union , or be forced out , this year			0
however , speaking friday in @entity95 , @entity72 said she was " absolutely convinced " that @entity9 and his partners in @entity5 's coalition government were doing everything they could to solve the nation 's economic problems			1
the chancellor said twice that she wanted @entity5 to remain a member of the euro currency union			0
but she also argued that the euro crisis stemmed from a lack of trust , which she said must be rebuilt			0
" i have made clear today that we absolutely expect from @entity5 that the promises which were made will also be kept , and implemented , " said @entity72			0
" that actions will follow their promises			0
" @entity5 is widely believed to have gone off - track with its program following the political turmoil of this year 's elections , which left the nation without a fully functioning government for weeks			2
however , @entity9 and his coalition partners have reportedly identified the roughly â ‚ ¬ 11 billion in additional budget cuts that it needs to secure the latest installment of bailout money			0
@entity122 officials are set to return to @entity79 in early september to complete their review			0
that means eurozone finance ministers will probably not make a decision on @entity5 's bailout money until they meet on october 8			1
