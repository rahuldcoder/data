-- maybe you know the phrase : " get off the phone ! " it was commonly heard in @entity6 households in the years when land - line telephones were the only phones there were			1
the bellowing might come from your dad , your sister -- from whoever in your family wanted to use the telephone , and who felt that you had been monopolizing it for too many minutes : " get off the phone ! " the admonition seemed to have disappeared once cell phones gained ascendancy , and everyone suddenly had their own personal , portable phones			1
your phone was yours and yours alone			2
who could tell you to hang up ? well , we all may be about to find out			0
from the government , to professional associations , to business owners , a common and serious - minded accord appears to be forming			2
so do n't be at all surprised if 2012 turns out to be the year when a national chorus of voices joins together to say ... you know			2
the @entity39 has called for a nationwide ban on the use of cell phones by drivers			1
this would include hands - free devices as well as hand - held phones			2
the reasoning is basic : drivers distracted by phone calls are a danger ; drivers who send or receive text messages while behind the wheel , or who play games or update social networks on their phones , are as potentially deadly as drunken drivers			1
" no call , no text , no update is worth a human life , " said @entity39 chairman @entity59			1
she 's right , of course , and if the proposal had been made in the days before cell phones became popular , there would be little controversy over it			1
make telephone calls while driving ? it would have sounded preposterous -- what were you supposed to do , get a 50 - mile - long extension cord ? -- and motorists would have instinctively understood the perils			1
the first rule of safety , drilled into generations of beginning drivers : keep both hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road			0
but it is far from certain that the @entity39 will get its way			1
the recommendation is for the 50 states to pass no - phones - while - driving laws			2
elected legislators can be expected to be hesitant about upsetting their constituents			0
the problem is that they would be taking away something citizens are already doing every day , and that many motorists would resist giving up			0
yet the same person who bristles when told that he or she should not be allowed to talk on the phone while behind the wheel -- " what if it 's an emergency ? i have to at least answer the phone to find out " -- likely would have a different reaction when asked , on a dark , rainy , wind - swept night : you 're on a two - lane road			1
you see a car coming around the next turn			0
do you want that other driver to be in the middle of a phone call , or texting ? the distractions and temptations inherent to constant cell phone use extend well beyond the highways			1
@entity116 of the @entity117 recently reported about a troubling situation at hospitals and doctors ' offices : physicians and staff members have constant access to smartphones , tablets and computers , which are supposed to make them more efficient			0
but @entity116 reported instances of " a neurosurgeon making personal calls during an operation , a nurse checking airfares during surgery and a poll showing that half of technicians running bypass machines had admitted texting during a procedure			1
" dr. @entity141 , director of critical care at the @entity142 ( @entity143 ) @entity144 , told @entity116 : " you walk around the hospital , and what you see is not funny ... my gut feeling is lives are in danger			0
" business owners and associations have , for years , quietly been trying to come up with workplace rules that will allow them to get a full day 's work from their employees , while not infuriating those same employees who are accustomed to having their cell phones always turned on			1
it 's another case of the horse having long ago escaped from the barn , and leaving the door wide open			0
in the days before cell phones , if business owners had been asked to allow their employees to install personal phone lines and use the phones whenever they wished , it would have sounded like a joke			1
the owners would have said : of course not			0
but , in the wireless era , it happened almost before anyone noticed			0
in @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , a writer for the business section of the @entity179 , surveyed business owners in north - central @entity176 and southeastern @entity181			0
many reported a " get off the phone ! " policy			0
" it 's not what i am paying them for , " @entity185 , a food store manager , told @entity177 for her story			0
he said cell phone use on company time was simply not allowed			1
restaurant operator @entity192 told @entity177 : " employees should leave their phones in their cars , or they can leave them in a basket in the manager 's office			2
" @entity200 , spokesman for a manufacturing firm , said signs are posted telling employees that cell phones are not permitted on the factory floor			0
( but what about bosses around the country who call or text employees on their cell phones after the employees have gone home for the day , or the weekend ? should n't this cut both ways ? if cell phones and personal calls are banned at work , should n't employers be expected to provide overtime payment to their employees for work - related calls made , and text messages sent , to them after business hours ? ) the @entity39 is committed as can be about the push to outlaw cell phones in cars			1
" the time to act is now , " said chairman @entity59			0
" how many more lives will be lost before we , as a society , change our attitudes about the deadliness of distractions ? " plenty of lives , undoubtedly			0
but the @entity39 is likely to fail in its effort			2
that horse that escaped from the barn is galloping down the road			0
past miles and miles of cars whose drivers are in the middle of phone calls , confident that they -- if not the other guy -- can easily handle it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

@entity251 : there is growing chorus of officials , employers urging less cell phone use
he says @entity39 warns against use in cars ; bosses pushing back on personal calls at work
he says cell - phone distractions even affect surgeons and nurses ; cut *productivity*
@entity251 : it may be *impossible* to take *people* 's freedom of cell use away from them
