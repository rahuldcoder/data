physician @entity0 on thursday held up @entity2 , a terrorist group that 's beheaded multiple @entity3 , as an example for the @entity3 during comments before the @entity6			1
" we 've got isis			0
they 've got the wrong philosophy , but they 're willing to die for what they believe , while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness , " he said during his speech at the @entity6 's winter meeting			1
" we have to change that			0
" @entity0 acknowledged his comments were likely to spark controversy and gain headlines , but he preemptively dismissed the press attention			1
" they are just so ridiculous , " he said , to laughter from the crowd			0
the remarks are similar to ones he made previously , likening the @entity3 government to @entity32 in that both , he argued , worked to silence their opponents			2
@entity0 stood by those comments when pressed in an interview with @entity1 's @entity38			2
it 's that very penchant — for frank and often controversial comments — that has made him so popular with the @entity43 base , and turned the retired neurosurgeon into a rising conservative star who just last month polled third in a @entity1 / @entity47 survey of the potential @entity43 presidential field			1
he 's made no secret of his interest in the race , and recently said he " feel [ s ] fingers " from @entity53 to run			0
many within the establishment wing of the party remain wary of him , however , because of his talent for the very remarks that make him so popular with the far right			0
he also started a firestorm of criticism over comments he made that @entity61 was the " worst thing " to happen to the @entity3 since slavery			2
but his appearance at the @entity6 's winter meeting , alongside the likes of @entity67 gov. @entity66 and 2012 @entity43 presidential nominee @entity68 , suggest that @entity0 's popularity on the right has earned him some notice from the establishment as the party charts its course heading into 2016			1
