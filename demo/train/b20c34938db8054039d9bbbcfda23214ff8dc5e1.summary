-- @entity1 pulled a rabbit out of its corporate hat earlier this month			1
the wireless giant announced a multibillion - dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum , which is like an open lane on the congested wireless internet highway			1
@entity1 purchased these rights from @entity11 and @entity12 , two large cable - tv companies , and the smaller @entity14			2
sound familiar ? @entity15 made a similarly surprising move in march , declaring its intention to buy @entity18 , in large part to get access to @entity18 's underused spectrum			1
the @entity15 deal drew the wrath of the @entity24 and the @entity25			2
indeed , it appears the current incarnation of the @entity15 proposed merger is dying a slow death			2
@entity31 district judge @entity30 agreed on monday to a request from both sides to delay the merger hearing , and asked @entity15 to supply information on whether it will pursue a different deal with @entity18			2
does a similar fate await @entity1 ? ah , you say , there 's no real comparison			2
unlike the proposed @entity15 / @entity18 merger , @entity1 's acquisition does n't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor , thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market			1
but the deals do have one big thing in common : in both , the primary objective is to cope with the looming scarcity of spectrum			2
for without more of it , neither carrier will be able to deliver on the promise of whizbang wireless services such as high definition movies any time , anywhere			1
to be sure , the problem here is not precisely a shortage of spectrum , but wasteful allocation of what 's usable with the latest technology			0
if @entity65 were so inclined , it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses			1
that includes spectrum warehoused by government : in many cases , the repositioning of equipment or the purchase of up - to - date equipment would allow tasks ranging from public safety communication to weather forecasting to be done as well with less			0
not to mention spectrum assigned long ago to local tv stations for old - fashioned analogue broadcasting that is no longer needed since the switch to digital			0
the process would be pretty simple : auction the spectrum to the highest bidders and then allow it to be traded like any other valuable resource			0
this is an old , but important , idea first suggested by @entity90 economics laureate @entity89 back in 1959			0
and it 's an idea that has taken on greater urgency in recent years , both because of the proliferation of spectrum - hungry wireless devices -- smartphones and tablets -- and because @entity65 desperately seeks revenue			1
( we 're talking tens of billions here			0
) but the politics of spectrum allocation remain gridlocked , as competing interests push and shove for preferred access , or just a claim on some of the cash from future spectrum auctions			0
so @entity15 and @entity1 , the no. 1 and 2 players in the @entity31 wireless market , have resorted to end - runs around the problem -- that is , buying spectrum from other carriers or merging to make more efficient use of the partners ' combined holdings			1
if the @entity15 / @entity18 combination survives the legal gantlet , it could , in theory , become the largest @entity31 wireless provider , with as much as one - third of the market			1
but the emphasis here is on the word " theory			0
" the merger might or might not reverse @entity18 's sinking fortunes , which is why its parent company , @entity127 , has signaled its intent to leave the @entity31 market , no matter what the government decides about the merger			0
the upshot is that it 's far from self - evident that @entity15 would remain first in subscribers for long in a post-merger market			2
@entity1 's @entity137 system , the holy grail of mobile excellence , is expected to be available to some 200 million @entity31 by the end of this year , compared with roughly 70 million for @entity15			1
moreover , the proposed @entity1 deal includes cross-marketing with the cable companies ' retail stores , yet another advantage in this most visible of consumer markets			2
but the merger seems to face implacable opposition from the trust - busters at the @entity24 and the micromanagers at the @entity25			0
both agencies argue that it would give @entity15 more latitude to raise prices			2
and neither apparently puts much weight on @entity15 's need for additional spectrum if it is to offer viable competition for @entity1 in a @entity137 world			1
if this were 1951 instead of 2011 , when self - satisfied @entity31 megacompanies like @entity162 set the pace for global industrial innovation , we 'd have more sympathy for the government 's tilt against market concentration			0
but as the @entity1 gambit makes clear , this is anything but a static contest			0
@entity15 and @entity1 are living in uncertain times in which they must run to stay in place			1
that does n't mean the risk of monopoly power is as dead as the @entity178			0
but it does mean that discretion in managing markets really has become the better part of valor			0
as we see it , @entity65 has three options			0
the first is to limit what firms like @entity1 and @entity15 can do to improve their service offerings , slowing the rollout of @entity137			1
the second is to break through interest - group gridlock and stimulate improvements in the wireless market with a lot more spectrum -- the best option , surely , but probably a political nonstarter in the near term because the relevant players seem unable to build the necessary political coalitions			0
the third option , and probably the best under the circumstances , is to look on the @entity1 and @entity15 gambits with sympathy , on the premise that the vitality of innovation means more to consumers than the potential downside of greater market concentration			1
does that mean giving @entity15 and @entity1 free passes ? hardly			1
but it would mean a change in priorities at @entity216 and the @entity25 in which the agencies use their legal leverage to minimize concentration in regional wireless markets without undermining the potential for more efficient use of spectrum			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : @entity1 , @entity15 deals are attempts to get more spectrum for wireless services
@entity235 , or *bandwidth* , is getting scarce because it is badly used , they maintain
@entity65 could sell spectrum for billions of dollars , they say , still minimize monopolies
writers : until then , regulators should look more kindly on *telecom* mergers
