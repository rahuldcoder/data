@entity0 want to get the latest issue of the world 's most controversial magazine but ca n't get your hands on a paper copy ? do n't worry , there 's an app for that			1
the @entity12 app features the so - called " survivors ' issue " of the satirical magazine , which sold out within minutes in @entity16 and across @entity17 this week			1
versions are available for @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
once downloaded , users can purchase the latest edition for $ 2.99			2
twelve people , including several of @entity16 's most famous cartoonists , were massacred at @entity12 's @entity27 office last week by gunmen who claimed the attack was retribution for the magazine 's notorious cartoon caricatures of @entity33 and the @entity34			1
thousands of people waited outside newsstands on wednesday -- some lining up before dawn -- to buy the new issue in a show of solidarity with the surviving members of @entity12 's staff			1
the magazine initially planned to publish 3 million copies of the issue -- 50 times the magazine 's typical weekly circulation of 60,000 -- but upped it to 5 million as demand outstripped supply at stores across @entity17			1
as shops ran out of copies , @entity12 columnist @entity52 wrote on @entity55 , " thank you , and rest assured we will reprint and redistribute			1
" on friday , hundreds of people still hoping to get their hands on a copy waited outside @entity62 in west @entity0 , which had limited sales of the in - demand issue to one copy per person			1
one customer , who identified herself as @entity68 , had arrived at the shop at 6:30 a.m. she told @entity1 : " i 'm an artist and a musician , so freedom of expression and speech is very vital to me			0
" " i 'm going to get my @entity16 flatmate to translate it for me and i 'm probably going to keep it as a keepsake , " another customer , who identified herself as @entity75 , told @entity1 as she left the shop with her copy			1
the cover of the latest edition features a cartoon of a tearful @entity34 holding a banner that says " @entity86 " -- a message of support for those killed that spread from social media to the streets of @entity17 last week -- and a headline that declared " all is forgiven			1
" any depiction of @entity33 's prophet is considered blasphemy by many @entity97 , and the latest edition received mixed reviews from the @entity97 community			1
" my initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy , " said @entity100 , a professor of @entity33 thought at @entity102 in @entity103			0
" they are not backing down from the depiction of @entity34 , exercising their free speech rights			0
at the same time , the message is conciliatory , humble , and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the @entity97 communities of @entity16			1
" @entity114 , an imam in @entity115 , took a dim view of the latest cover but urged his 100,000 @entity119 followers to follow the example of @entity34			2
" as it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again , @entity97 will inevitably be hurt and angered , but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love & are angered for , " @entity114 said			0
" enduring patience , tolerance , gentleness and mercy was the character of our beloved @entity34			0
" @entity12 is no stranger to controversy			1
in november 2011 the magazine 's office was burned down on the same day it was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at @entity33 law			1
the cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the @entity34 with a bubble saying , " 100 lashes if you 're not dying of laughter			0
" in september 2012 , despite the ongoing global furor over the anti-islam film " @entity149 , " the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked @entity34 , along with a cover that appeared to depict a @entity97 man being pushed in a wheelchair by an @entity155			2
@entity16 and @entity157 officials expressed dismay with the decision , and @entity16 closed embassies and schools in about 20 countries temporarily as a precaution			2
@entity12 journalist @entity164 -- who survived last week 's deadly attack -- defended the magazine at the time , saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence			1
" the aim is to laugh , " @entity164 told @entity170 in 2012			0
" we want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist			0
they can be @entity97 , @entity176 , @entity177			0
everyone can be religious , but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept			0
" " in @entity16 , we always have the right to write and draw			2
and if some people are not happy with this , they can sue us and we can defend ourselves			2
that 's democracy , " @entity164 said			2
" you do n't throw bombs , you discuss , you debate			0
but you do n't act violently			0
we have to stand and resist pressure from extremism			0
" @entity1 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
