-- @entity3 wants an end to @entity6 's long blockade of @entity7 and raids on the territory in any cease - fire that might put a stop to five days of weaponry plummeting from the sky , a top @entity2 official said sunday			1
@entity3 , the @entity2 militant group that has ruled @entity7 since 2007 , said an @entity6 airstrike killed a family of 10 on sunday			1
@entity6 , meanwhile , said @entity3 had fired nearly 150 rockets into @entity6 in a single day , and that the strike was aimed at killing one of the leaders of the militant group 's rocket corps -- but @entity6 was unsure whether he was among the dead			1
it was the latest violence in what has become a daily nightmare for millions in the region , one that puts @entity7 's 1.7 million residents and millions of @entity6 in harm 's way			1
but an @entity6 special envoy was in @entity33 for cease - fire talks late sunday , the @entity33 government said , and a stream of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 diplomats were darting in and out of the region on similar errands			1
@entity42 , a senior @entity2 negotiator , said @entity3 is demanding an end to " the harassment and draconian siege of @entity7 that prevents anything from coming in or going out , so that there will be a normal life for the people of @entity7			1
" the territory has been under a crippling economic embargo since @entity3 won control of the territory from the @entity55 - led @entity54 , which controls the @entity56			2
@entity57 fears escalation to ground invasion but @entity54 president @entity60 said sunday that he is in " continuing contact " with exiled @entity3 leader @entity62 and called for @entity2 unity during the @entity6 offensive			1
@entity42 , also a @entity55 leader , said @entity3 wants @entity6 to stop targeting the leadership of @entity2 factions and to expand the waters @entity2 fishermen are allowed to trawl from three miles offshore to 30			1
@entity42 said the @entity2 goal was to reach not only an end to the latest fighting but a long - term cease - fire between @entity3 and @entity6			1
" the attempt is to reach a real stable situation			0
that 's why they are asking for commitment on @entity6 typical aggression and periodic incursions and constant shooting and firing at the fishermen in the sea , " he said			2
but rockets continued to fall on @entity6 on sunday , and airstrikes continued in @entity7			1
fresh sirens sounded sunday in @entity89 , but the @entity90 reported that it had intercepted at least two rockets headed for the city with its " @entity94 " missile - defense system			2
a rocket struck a car in the @entity6 town of @entity98 , while another hit a woman 's carport while she was inside her house in @entity103			2
@entity94 is a game - changer , @entity6 say and in @entity7 , @entity3 - run @entity105 television showed images of children 's bodies being carried away from a house blown apart by an @entity6 airstrike			1
they were among a family of 10 who died there , according to a @entity2 ambulance service			0
on @entity118 , the @entity117 -- @entity3 ' military wing -- called it a " massacre committed by @entity6 occupation			1
" but lt. col. @entity122 , the @entity90 's chief spokeswoman , told @entity0 that @entity123 -- a " senior @entity3 member " -- was targeted in the strike			0
the @entity90 identified @entity126 as one of the leaders of the @entity3 rocket - launching unit			2
" when i say a senior @entity3 member , i mean members that have @entity6 blood on their hands -- members of @entity3 that planned either the abduction of soldiers or are very much involved in targeting @entity6 , " she told @entity0			1
@entity136 : what is @entity3 ? @entity138 said the house was @entity141 's home and suspected command center and that the @entity6 military was examining video of the strike to look for signs of secondary explosions -- an indication that there were explosives inside			1
but late sunday , she said she did not know for sure whether @entity141 had been killed			0
@entity6 also said sunday that it was not to blame for the death of a @entity2 child last week -- a 4 - year - old boy whose lifeless body was kissed by @entity33 prime minister @entity155 during his visit to a @entity7 hospital friday			1
@entity0 visited the child 's home , which neighbors said had been bombed five hours previously			0
neighbors and family members told @entity0 they heard an aircraft before the explosion			0
but the @entity6 military told @entity0 on sunday it did not carry out any airstrikes at the time of the child 's death			2
the @entity90 said had stopped its attacks for @entity155 's visit , raising questions about what caused the fatal blast			0
one possibility could be the misfire of a @entity3 rocket intended for @entity6 , since @entity0 's crew in @entity7 said it saw two such rockets passing overhead -- apparently fired not far from where the boy lived			1
@entity181 : what does this all mean ? @entity6 launched its offensive on wednesday in response to persistent rocket attacks from militants in @entity7			1
early monday , the @entity7 health ministry said 76 people have been killed in @entity7 during the ongoing hostilities			1
it was not clear how many of the dead were combatants			0
earlier , the territory 's interior ministry said 20 children and eight women were among the dead			0
more than 660 people were injured , the interior ministry said			0
the @entity90 said one @entity6 was wounded sunday			0
three @entity6 had been killed and 69 wounded over the course of the conflict			0
militants in @entity7 had fired nearly 1,000 rockets at @entity6 , the @entity90 reported			1
more than 340 had been intercepted , including 41 of the 146 fired sunday , the military said			2
meanwhile , the @entity90 conducted 130 strikes during the day , it reported			1
the @entity90 , which has been touting the " pinpoint " precision of its airstrikes via @entity118 , said it had hit a slew of what it called " terrorist " sites while sparing other damage			0
" terrorists put an underground launch site next to a mosque			0
the mosque was unharmed , " the @entity90 said in one post , which was accompanied by military video of the raid			0
the @entity6 military has also said that nearly 100 rockets fired from @entity7 in recent days have crashed back into the strip			1
" @entity3 fires from civilian areas and hits its own people , " it said on @entity118			0
the @entity6 government has called up 75,000 reservists and massed 30,000 troops across the border of the @entity2 territory , the @entity90 said			0
in @entity232 , @entity6 prime minister @entity231 told reporters that @entity6 is prepared to significantly escalate its operation against @entity2 militants in @entity7			1
" we are exacting a heavy price from @entity3 and the ( other ) terrorist organizations , and @entity90 is prepared for a significant expansion of its operations , " @entity231 said before his weekly @entity237 meeting			0
the fighting has put new strains on @entity6 's relationship with @entity33 , which is attempting to broker a cease - fire			1
the @entity248 - led government that took power in june has pledged to maintain @entity33 's peace treaty with @entity6 -- the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the turbulent region -- but sympathy for the @entity2 runs deep among @entity33			1
on @entity33 's border with @entity7 , about 500 @entity33 protesters crossed into the territory on sunday in what their leader said was a show of solidarity with the @entity2			2
they raised @entity2 flags and chanted , " we are the youth of january 25 revolution , @entity263 will be free ! open the crossing , @entity6 is the enemy ! " " we have broken the siege , " said @entity270 , the group 's main organizer			0
" @entity273 has changed the region			0
we are happy to go in to support our @entity2 brothers , but it 's sad to hear the explosions of the @entity6 bombing of @entity7 all the way on the @entity33 side			1
we brought in small amounts medical supplies , food , and water , but our main message is political support to the @entity287			0
" @entity37 secretary - general @entity290 and 16 foreign ministers from the league 's member states will drive into @entity7 on tuesday for talks , a spokesman for the organization said			2
meanwhile , @entity60 will hold talks in the @entity56 with @entity296 , the envoy for the @entity297 , and with @entity38 @entity290 ban ki - moon during their visits to the region in the coming days , said @entity301 , a member of the @entity303 's executive committee and an @entity60 ally			2
the @entity57 and several @entity40 countries have put the brunt of the blame for the current crisis on @entity3 , an @entity309 fundamentalist movement that has been branded a terrorist organization by the @entity57 , @entity6 and the @entity311			2
those @entity313 powers say @entity6 has a right to self - defense , while @entity317 and @entity248 nations have accused @entity6 of being the aggressor			2
rocket attacks into @entity6 were the " precipitating event " for the fighting under way now , @entity57 president @entity319 said during a stop in @entity325 on sunday			0
" we are actively working with all the parties in the region to see if we can end those missiles being fired without further escalation of violence in the region			0
" @entity319 said he has spoken with @entity231 , @entity33 president @entity333 , and @entity335 prime minister @entity334			0
he emphasized that " those who champion the cause of the @entity2 should recognize that if we see a further escalation of the situation in @entity7 , then the likelihood " of peace talks resuming that could lead to a two - state solution " is going to be pushed off way into the future , " @entity319 said			2
@entity0 's @entity346 reported from @entity347 ; @entity0 's @entity348 reported from southern @entity6 ; and @entity0 's @entity349 from @entity350			0
@entity0 's @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 and @entity356 contributed to this report .			0
