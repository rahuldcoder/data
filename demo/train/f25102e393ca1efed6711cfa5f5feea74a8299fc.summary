@entity0 -- the @entity5 cobra that turned media darling following its escape and subsequent capture at the @entity9 is doing well and should return to display in a week or so , the zoo 's director said friday			1
the 3 - ounce , 20 - inch reptile slithered out of her enclosure on saturday and turned up thursday after zoo officials scattered rodent - scented wood shavings in a bid to lure her out in hopes of a meal			2
zoo officials still do n't know how the snake got out , director @entity19 said			1
" anyone who has ever dealt with snakes or kept snakes knows that they are notorious as escape artists , " he said			0
the disappearance of an animal whose venom can kill an elephant in three hours -- and a human in 15 minutes -- sparked more amusement than panic , drawing 200,000 followers to an anonymously authored @entity36 feed that had the snake taking tours of the city and threatening to drop down the chimneys of unsuspecting city dwellers			2
all the attention has brought plenty of notice to the zoo , @entity19 said , laughing			0
" it certainly has put us out there , " he said			0
" but we would have preferred to be out there for another reason			0
" still , the zoo is going to make the most of it			0
zoo workers will closely monitor the snake to make sure she 's suffered no ill effects from her escapade , then will put her back on display so people who have been so supportive since her disappearance have a chance to see her , @entity19 said			1
then they plan to have a naming contest with the @entity66 .			1
