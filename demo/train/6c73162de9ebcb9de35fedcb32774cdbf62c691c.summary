-- princesses transformed into ghouls			2
the world 's most famous theme park turned into a vomitorium			2
and you thought this was the happiest place on earth			2
in " @entity14 , " the most buzzed - about movie out of this year 's @entity13 , director @entity11 presents @entity15 as a dystopian hellscape and uses it as the backdrop for a descent into madness			1
@entity20 ( @entity21 ) is on holiday with his wife and two children when he learns he 's been fired from his job			2
as he reels from that news , his mental state progressively worsens as he and his family navigate the park			2
shot in black and white , @entity15 's " attractions " become nightmarish specters as perceived by @entity20 's unstable mind			1
now the @entity15 is weighing whether to quash the film or to let it slide -- not so much because of the disturbing imagery , but rather the way @entity11 made his movie			1
in an audacious act of filmmaking , he shot it almost entirely at @entity15 and @entity41 -- all without @entity15 's knowledge or permission			1
after a screening of the film at @entity13 , @entity11 answered questions from an enthusiastic audience , hinting at how he pulled off his cinematic subterfuge			1
avoiding detection by @entity15 security took " a lot of planning , " he said			1
" we were careful and cautious and tried not to draw too much attention to ourselves			0
but planning was the main thing			0
" @entity21 said shooting in such a stealthy fashion " was scary			0
... it was exciting and fun			0
" in a " director 's statement " included in press materials for the film , @entity11 describes the origins of his film : " heavily influenced by various strange outings i endured as a boy with my father -- who at the time lived in @entity69 , @entity70 -- ' @entity14 ' is my personal attempt to make sense of what felt like a very artificial childhood , brought on by our cultural obsession with these fake , manufactured worlds of so - called fantasy			1
" he adds , " i think the film is really about defining the word ' escape ' and how so many @entity83 households seek it out in a yearly pilgrimage to a materialistic @entity85			0
" it 's a small , small dysfunctional world after all , in @entity11 's depiction			0
the director said he succeeded in making his film without tipping off @entity15 largely because of advances in camera technology			1
it 's now possible to shoot high - quality video with what looks like , to the uncritical eye , a digital slr camera			2
" ( @entity96 ) slr 's had just hit the market at that point , " @entity11 said			0
" so we had the @entity100 we could bring into the park and look like a tourist			0
" @entity11 shot for 10 days at the @entity15 parks in @entity69 , and for two weeks at @entity41 in @entity104 , @entity105			1
( he filmed additional scenes off @entity15 property on a soundstage in @entity109 and at a hotel in the @entity109 area			1
) his crew and actors went unnoticed by @entity15 , until near the end of filming			1
" we almost got caught once			0
... we were shooting in the entrance of the park and we had to do a few takes and basically they thought our team was just paparazzi and we were shooting a famous family ( entering the park )			0
" @entity11 said @entity15 security pulled his actors aside and demanded to know why they had entered and then re-entered the park within a seven - minute period			1
he said his crew took advantage of a passing parade to scatter while @entity21 and his co-star , @entity130 , struggled to explain themselves			0
@entity21 said he felt like he was " acting for his life			0
" he said he told @entity15 security he and his " family " entered and then quickly left the park because they needed to reapply sunscreen			1
while his interrogator was temporarily distracted , he hid his microphone and mini tape - recorder -- used to record dialogue -- in his sock			2
if that had been discovered , the game would have been up			0
" it was very scary that day , " @entity21 admitted			0
although @entity11 and company escaped @entity15 's notice then , the company now knows about them all too well			1
at the @entity150 , an audience member claimed , " @entity15 is furious and they are going to sue			1
" that may or may not be true			0
@entity15 told @entity0 " ( we ) are aware of the film " but " are not commenting at this time			2
" @entity11 seems resigned to a possible lawsuit from @entity15 that might keep the film from ever being seen by the wider public , but he described " @entity14 " as a passion project that he could not step away from , despite the legal risks			1
" it started off really small and it just kind of snowballed , " he said			0
and at one point there was no turning back			0
