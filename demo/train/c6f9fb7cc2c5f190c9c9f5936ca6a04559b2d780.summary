@entity0 -- @entity2 says his life began the day he met @entity4 by chance at a birthday party in april 1990			1
@entity4 had recently started a job with @entity8 , and @entity2 was studying at a nearby college			1
the strangers arrived at the party at the same time , and @entity2 held the door open for @entity4 , catching his eye			1
" it was love at first sight			2
we felt we belonged together , " @entity2 said			2
what followed was a whirlwind romance lived out across two continents , through overseas phone calls and hand - written love letters			0
@entity2 , a @entity23 national , spent the past two decades in and out of the @entity24 leapfrogging from one visa to another , in hopes of creating a life together with @entity4 , who was born and raised outside of @entity29 , @entity30			1
but 21 years and four adopted children later , the couple -- who were married in @entity32 in 2008 -- is fighting to stay together since @entity2 's final visa expired in september			1
@entity2 faces deportation because immigration officials are barred from recognizing their marriage under the @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1

" i will no longer ride in the back of the bus			0
i am tired of waiting for people to give me rights , " @entity4 said			2

the immigration authorities will now review their information and make a decision about their green card petition at a later date			0
@entity2 and @entity4 represent a growing number of same - sex couples with a partner of foreign nationality at risk of separation under @entity38 , according to the couple 's immigration attorney , @entity74			1
" they have sacrificed everything for their family , and the idea that the federal government wants to tear them apart in the name of the @entity38 is preposterous and can not [ be allowed to ] happen , " said @entity74 , co-founder of @entity76 , a campaign to stop the deportations of spouses of gay and lesbian @entity24			2
@entity38 was passed in 1996 by the @entity89 - controlled @entity88 and signed into law by @entity92 president @entity91			0
it bars federal recognition of same - sex marriages and says states can not be forced to recognize such marriages from other states			0
@entity2 and @entity4 are hoping their case is placed on hold until @entity38 makes it to the @entity103			1
on the flip side , if their petition is rejected , deportation proceedings could begin for @entity2			1
" if i 'm deported , the whole family is deported			0
you do n't split a family , " @entity2 said			2
" it could make me mad , but it makes me sad			0
" in february , president @entity113 ordered the @entity114 to stop defending the constitutionality of the @entity38			0
despite the order , the administration will continue to enforce the law			0
" ( @entity38 ) is clearly unconstitutional because it violates basic equality rights , " said @entity119 , associate professor of law at @entity121 's @entity120			0
" unless the legislative stars align themselves and make it a part of the priority to repeal @entity38 , it will take some time for the courts to get to it			0
" the couple is not seeking special treatment , instead they 're asking for equal protection under the law , @entity4 said			1
" you live constantly with the stress of knowing that you 're a second - class citizen and at any moment your family could be torn apart by the same government that permitted you to become a family , " @entity4 said			2
" this is not gay life			0
this is two guys with a lot of kids trying to get laundry done and homework finished			0
" with @entity2 unable to work because of his visa status , @entity4 is now the sole breadwinner for the family			1
@entity2 runs the household when @entity4 is at work , packing lunches , getting the kids off to school , and shuttling their brood to doctor 's appointments and activities			1
" i simply could not do this by myself , " @entity4 said			2
" the private schools are gone , the nice cars are gone , and the big house is gone			0
but we have our family and we have our love			0
" @entity4 chronicles their daily life on his blog , where he creates a " virtual scrapbook " of the couple 's children : his daughter , @entity43 , getting her ears pierced for @entity174 ; his son , @entity45 being rushed to the hospital when he bit his tongue after falling off his pogo stick ; and the family trip to @entity180 for the @entity182 @entity181 in 2010			1
