-- thousands lined the streets on friday as the body of cpl. @entity4 began its final journey home			1
his death dominated international headlines this week both for its circumstances and the impression he left behind			2
especially touching have been images of his dogs , unaware their master is never returning home			2
but the following account from what may have been the last person to speak directly to @entity4 , and tell him he was loved , is especially poignant			1
attorney @entity21 was early for a meeting on wednesday when she stopped at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , to take a few photos			1
two men in uniform solemnly stood guard			2
in an interview with @entity31 on thursday , she said she remembers remarking to herself what a beautiful october day it was			2
" the sun had come out			2
it was a wonderful fall picture			0
i got two pictures straight on of these gentlemen standing in front of the cenotaph			0
" moments later the beauty would dissolve into scenes of panic , chaos and mourning as shots were fired and one of those guards , @entity4 , was hit			1
video from the scene just after the shooting shows gunman @entity51 calmly returning to his illegally parked car on the roadside , holding what appears to be a weapon			0
it is believed @entity51 shot @entity4 and drove a short distance to the @entity59 building , where he opened fire again			1
@entity51 was eventually killed by sergeant - at - arms @entity61			0
no one else was injured			0
@entity21 said she was already walking toward @entity63 when she heard the shots and found herself moving toward the sounds as other people ran away			1
soon she found herself kneeling at @entity4 's side , along with a handful others			1
" i think it 's human nature to run towards somebody to help them , " she said			0
@entity21 had served many years in the @entity73 , part of that service as a medical assistant			1
several people worked together in an attempt to save @entity4 's life , including a nurse and another corporal , @entity21 told interviewer @entity82			1
nearly breathless at times during the interview , @entity21 calmly detailed their various roles			1
but her voice caught and eventually broke as she described talking to @entity4 , telling him that he was loved , and that he was a brave man			1
" just think of what you were doing when this happened , " she said she told him			0
" just think you were standing at the cenotaph			0
just think of how proud that will make your family			0
your family must love you so much			0
an image of @entity21 and the others bent over @entity4 was captured by photographer @entity95			1
but @entity21 said she kept speaking because she had once been in a coma , and although no one could tell , she could hear everything			1
" i just repeated , repeated , repeated that he was a brave man , that he was a good man , that he was loved , that he was respected , " she said			0
off asked @entity21 what instinct prompted her to speak to him about love			2
she paused a moment before answering			0
" i think you tell people when they 're sick , or when they 're ill , or when they 're hurting that they 're loved			0
because everybody 's loved , " she said through tears , " by somebody			0
