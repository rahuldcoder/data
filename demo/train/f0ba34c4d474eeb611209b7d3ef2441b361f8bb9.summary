-- -- the well - publicized landing of 40 @entity2 in @entity3 on tuesday spurred glee among some @entity3 and the immigrants themselves and drew public scorn from a surprising quarter in @entity7 -- two officials from its centuries - old @entity10 community			1
one of them described the emigration as a " misinformation " campaign and defended their lives under the government of @entity7 president @entity18			1
the arrival in @entity3 was publicized as the largest single group to arrive in @entity3 from @entity7 since @entity7 's @entity21 , and the immigrants traveled via an undisclosed third country			1
other @entity7 @entity10 have immigrated to @entity3 over the years			1
anti-semitism has been a worldwide phenomenon for centuries and the state of @entity3 became a homeland for @entity10 to escape anti-semitic persecution			1
the group that sponsored the immigration is the @entity32 , based in @entity33			0
it says it wants to help @entity10 flee such persecution			0
the group receives money from evangelical @entity38			0
its founder , rabbi @entity39 , believes @entity7 jews face dangers , citing the words of @entity18 , who has urged @entity3 's destruction but not by military means			2
there has been great criticism of @entity18 by @entity10 across the globe for his remarks about @entity3 , for the government 's stance toward @entity3 , and for the regime 's sponsorship of a recent holocaust denial seminar			2
@entity39 said immigrants received $ 10,000 each because they left behind possessions to go to @entity3			1
noting the evangelical support from his group , @entity39 , in fact , believes it 's no " coincidence " that the people came to @entity3 on christmas day , which @entity39 describes as " kind of a @entity63 present to these folks from @entity38 in @entity65 who seek to tell @entity3 and the @entity10 people that they 're not alone			1
" the immigration comes at a time of great tension between @entity7 , whose president stoutly rejects the jewish state 's existence , and @entity3 , which asserts that @entity7 is funding terrorism , has ambitions to develop nuclear weapons , and is intent on destroying the jewish state			2
but the account of the mass immigration was vehemently disputed among @entity10 officials in @entity81 who defend @entity10 life there			0
the man representing @entity7 jews in @entity7 's parliament on wednesday disputed the notion of an organized immigration of @entity2 to @entity3 , saying he would have known about such a development			2
@entity7 mp @entity88 told @entity0 that he and @entity89 , the director of the @entity90 , had issued a statement condemning the spread of false news about an evangelical organization facilitating the immigration of 40 @entity7 jews to @entity3			1
@entity7 @entity10 can travel anywhere they want , anytime they want , but like other @entity7 they are not allowed to go to @entity3 , @entity97 said			1
even with that , some @entity7 jews may decide to travel to and from @entity3 via a third country to visit their families or to visit for religious reasons			2
however , @entity97 called the news a " misinformation " campaign aimed at creating an atmosphere of distrust between the @entity108 and @entity10 communities in @entity7			1
he said it is meant to make @entity7 jews feel unsafe and vulnerable in their own country			0
he said that before the @entity21 in 1979 , @entity7 @entity10 numbered more than 100,000 , but like other minorities their numbers diminished because of immigration			1
he said almost 95 percent of @entity2 went to the @entity65 and as a result there is now quite a sizable @entity7 jewish community there			2
the remaining 5 percent , he said , went to @entity119 and @entity3			0
there are as many as an estimated 20,000 to 25,000 @entity10 remaining in @entity7 , the largest jewish community in the @entity122 outside @entity3 , according to @entity0 's @entity123			1
the @entity125 's 2007 report on religious freedom says the @entity7 government 's " rhetoric and actions created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all @entity132 religious groups , most notably for @entity133 's , " who are based in the @entity3 city of @entity136			1
it also cites " @entity138 , evangelical christians , and members of the @entity10 community			1
" jews by @entity7 constitutional law have the right to practice their religion and " with some exception , " there has been scant government restriction and interference with religious practices , the report said			0
however , " members of these recognized minority religious groups have reported government imprisonment , harassment , intimidation , and discrimination based on their religious beliefs			0
" jewish education has been tougher to carry out , there has been a rise in anti-semitic rhetoric , and assaults on two synagogues , the report said			0
their contact with or support for the state of @entity3 has been squelched " out of fear of reprisal			0
" " recent anti-american and anti-israeli demonstrations included the denunciation of @entity10 , as opposed to the past practice of denouncing only ' @entity3 ' and " @entity175 , " adding to the threatening atmosphere for the community , " the report said			2
in the @entity180 's @entity10 community , there is a different view from voices emerging			0
@entity89 described the @entity10 community in @entity81 as alive and well , with 20 synagogues , more than eight butcher shops , two restaurants , and four youth groups			0
" there is no doubt that the @entity190 happened , " he said			0
" but we disagree with the superpowers who have misused this incident to their own benefit			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity0 's @entity198 contributed to this report			0

senior @entity7 jew calls mass emigration of 40 @entity10 to @entity3 " misinformation "
