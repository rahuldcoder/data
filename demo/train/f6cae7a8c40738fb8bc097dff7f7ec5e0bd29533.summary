-- the number of undocumented children crossing the @entity6 - @entity5 border by themselves has " increased substantially , " causing the @entity7 to declare a " crisis " and open a temporary emergency shelter for the youths , a spokeswoman said monday			1
in the past two weeks , more than 1,000 children were apprehended while illegally crossing the border , officials said , straining facilities for @entity7 and the @entity15			1
the majority of the minors were apprehended at the border in @entity19 , near @entity20			1
they primarily traveled from @entity22 , including @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , according to @entity26 , a spokeswoman for homeland security secretary @entity27			1
more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles are expected to cross in 2014 , said @entity29 , vice president of the @entity30 in the @entity31 , a @entity6 @entity34 workers ' union			2
" we are seeing numbers that we 've never seen before in this part of the country , " @entity29 said			2
" yesterday , we had 60 minors in one station alone			2
you 're talking kids from 17 years old , on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old , traveling by themselves			0
" last year , roughly 10 % of people caught by @entity34 agents were minors , according to a @entity34 official			0
" secretary @entity27 is sending additional staff to @entity19 to coordinate @entity7 and interagency efforts to meet the immediate needs of the migrants , including medical care ... and to address other processing and enforcement concerns , " @entity26 said			1
part of the plan under the " level 4 condition of readiness " is an emergency shelter that opened over the weekend at @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity19 , and can accommodate up to 1,000 children , officials said			1
the law prohibits @entity7 from immediately deporting the children if they are not from @entity66 or @entity5			2
instead , the children are turned over to @entity15 supervision " within 72 hours of @entity7 taking them into custody , " an official said			2
" most of the time , they 're getting released to relatives in the @entity6 , " @entity29 said			0
" there 's nowhere to put them , so they 're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date			0
i 'd say between 95 and 97 % of adults or youths do n't show up for court , " he said			0
although children crossing the border alone has long been an issue , the recent spike could be attributed to better weather or an increase in poor economic conditions in their home countries , officials said			1
others simply want to be reunited with their parents , who may have left them with relatives in their native countries			0
children make the arduous trek from @entity22 across @entity5 by train or with the help of smugglers called " coyotes , " officials said			1
most often , the youths from @entity5 and @entity22 try to cross the border in the @entity31 because it is the southernmost point of the @entity6 for them to cross			1
" people that live north have no idea what 's going on down here , and if they did , they would be appalled by what the government is letting happen , " @entity29 said			0
i understand we 're in a fiscal crunch nationwide , but this is not a problem that we can fix for free			0
i know the official line is that we 're at 70 % apprehension , but it 's really more like 30 %			0
there 's a strain on manpower , " he added			0
the deadliest trip in @entity22 ? perilous desert trek can end in deportation or death border showdown : families demand @entity6 entry to reunite with relatives			1
