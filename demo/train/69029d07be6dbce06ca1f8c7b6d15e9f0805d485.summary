@entity0 , @entity1 -- attorneys for the family of an unarmed @entity1 teen shot to death last month plan to pursue a civil case against a homeowner 's association , the family 's lawyer said saturday			1
@entity13 , attorney for the family of @entity15 , spoke to board members of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) about the case			1
he said there is evidence that the @entity22 homeowner 's association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call @entity25 if they could not contact the police , according to an @entity17 statement			1
@entity15 , 17 , was killed february 26 as he walked to his father 's fiancee 's house in @entity0 , @entity1 , after a trip to the convenience store			1
police say he was shot by @entity25 , a neighborhood watch volunteer who says he was acting in self - defense			1
@entity15 was unarmed , carrying a bag of @entity37 candy and an iced tea , according to police			2
protesters upset about @entity15 's death took to streets in cities across the country saturday , with some questioning why @entity25 has not been arrested			1
other protests are planned for sunday			0
" there are inconsistencies in our @entity50 laws that allow people to claim self - defense as a way to get away with murder , " said @entity46			0
a student at @entity57 , he sent video from a march in @entity60 another demonstration was staged alongside a busy road in @entity63 , @entity64 , where many of the protesters wore hooded sweatshirts like the one @entity15 had on when he was shot			1
" in a nutshell i think this case is not being handled properly -- that is why we have so many protests			0
it was a senseless situation , " said @entity73 @entity72			0
and in @entity0 , @entity1 , a handful of members from the @entity77 rallied and offered a $ 10,000 reward for @entity25 's " capture			1
" " it 's time for us , as black men , to take justice in our own hands			0
if you wo n't give us justice , we will have to take justice , " said @entity1 organizer @entity85			1
a life for a life			0
" @entity92 , which the @entity93 describes as a " virulently racist and anti-semitic organization , " is distinct from the better - known @entity77 , founded in the late 1960s			0
the city of @entity0 responded to the bounty offer by calling for " calm heads and no vigilante justice			0
" " attempts by civilians to take any person into custody may result in criminal charges or unnecessary violence , " it said in a statement			0
meanwhile , a lawyer for the man at the center of the death investigation said @entity1 's " stand your ground " law does n't apply to the shooting that killed the teen			1
" in my legal opinion , that 's not really applicable to this case			2
the statute on ' stand your ground ' is primarily when you 're in your house , " said @entity119 , @entity25 's attorney			1
" this is self - defense , and that 's been around for forever -- that you have a right to defend yourself			0
so the next issue ( that ) is going to come up is , was he justified in using the amount of force he did ? " the 2005 law allows people to use deadly force anywhere they have a right to be if they have reasonable fear an assailant could seriously harm them or someone else			0
it also eliminated a long - standing " duty to retreat " in the face of imminent harm , asserting that would - be crime victims have the right to " stand their ground " and " meet force with force " when attacked			2
the case has sparked a national debate over the @entity1 law and concerns about racial profiling			1
@entity15 was black and @entity25 is white @entity155			2
@entity1 gov. @entity156 appointed a special prosecutor , @entity157 , to look into the case			1
she said her office will decide whether to charge @entity25 , clear him or send the case to a grand jury			1
the case has also prompted a @entity50 @entity164 investigation , which is in the fact - finding stage			0
the @entity166 said officers were prohibited from arresting @entity25 the night of the shooting because physical evidence and testimony supported his claim that he acted in self - defense in accordance with @entity1 law			1
the police department gave the explanation to city manager @entity177 , who included it in a letter to the community about the case , posted on the city 's website			1
@entity119 said he and @entity25 have not discussed what happened the night @entity15 was shot , though he said @entity25 has talked with authorities -- unaccompanied by counsel -- whenever they have asked him to do so			2
@entity25 said he was driving in his gated community when he saw @entity15 walking and called 911 to report a suspicious person			2
@entity25 told the dispatcher he was following the boy , but the dispatcher told him that was n't necessary			2
moments later , several neighbors called 911 to report a commotion outside , and police arrived to find @entity15 dead of a gunshot wound			0
@entity119 says his client was injured that night and went to the hospital with a broken nose and a serious cut on the back of his head			0
" this is not about self - defense , " the rev. @entity205 told a crowd in @entity207 on saturday			0
" this is about a man deciding somebody , based on who he was , was a suspect and that he would take matters into his own hands			0
" @entity205 , who attended a rally in @entity0 earlier this week , promised a " spring offensive of non-violent protests " nationwide about the case			0
former @entity1 gov. @entity221 , who signed the " stand your ground " bill into law , said friday that he does not believe it applies to the case			1
" stand your ground means stand your ground			2
it does n't mean chase after somebody who 's turned their back , " @entity221 said while visiting a university campus in @entity231			1
@entity0 police said @entity25 did not indicate a chase , telling them instead that " he had lost sight of @entity15 and was returning to his truck to meet the police officer when he says he was attacked by @entity244 , " the police said in the letter posted by @entity177			2
@entity119 said he believes @entity25 's life is in danger and has advised him to keep a low profile			1
" this case is spinning out of control , " he said			0
" i hope there 's a way to rein things in so it does n't become an issue of a racial battle			2
i hope that things come back so that there can be a time for justice and for healing and not for just skipping the whole judicial process and going straight to sentencing			0
