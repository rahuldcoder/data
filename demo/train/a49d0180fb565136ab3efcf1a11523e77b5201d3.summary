@entity0 -- the @entity3 military has everything it needs to strike @entity6 inside @entity7 and is awaiting president @entity9 's authorization to do so , @entity3 military officials tell @entity1			1
for weeks , intelligence and military targeting specialists have been working around the clock on a list of targets			2
it 's expected the list will be presented to the president one more time , with some analysis of the risks of bombing inside @entity7 , as well as possible rewards in terms of destroying and degrading @entity6 , according to the officials			1
it is most likely that the target list will be broadly described to the president , with some analysis about what would be accomplished			1
presidents generally do not review each and every target before a strike			0
the broad guidance is given and then the military selects the time , date , place -- after the president makes the political decision to proceed			2
secretary of defense @entity39 told the @entity41 on thursday that he and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff @entity42 signed off on plans to strike @entity6 in @entity7			1
he said gen. @entity44 , the commander of the @entity45 , briefed @entity9 on wednesday on the plan for striking @entity6 in @entity7			1
" @entity45 's plan includes targeted actions against @entity6 safe havens in @entity7 -- including its command and control , logistics capabilities , and infrastructure , " @entity47 said			1
" our actions will not be restrained by a border that exists in name only			0
" @entity9 is " actively " reviewing options and has " offered guidance " to the @entity63 about the target sets that he 's reviewed , @entity60 spokesman @entity59 said last week			1
but @entity59 said that @entity9 is not signing off on each strike			2
" these are very difficult operational decisions that will have to be made on a case - by - case basis			0
many of them do n't rise to a presidential level , to the level of the commander in chief , " @entity59 said			0
@entity60 approves plan to assist @entity7 rebels in the " old days , " there were literally target " folders			2
" the military would thumb through a sheaf of classified papers detailing the target , and what aircraft and bombs would be used to strike it			2
nowadays , it 's all computerized , of course			0
the goal , if not the process , is largely the same			0
the @entity3 has been flying drones over @entity7 , looking at areas where @entity6 operates			1
the drones are looking for personnel , equipment depots , training camps , and the locations of the group 's leaders			2
@entity3 officials tell @entity1 if top leadership can be located , they will be on the target list to strike			1
if past strike procedures against terrorist leaders in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 are used again , the president would preauthorize strikes against the leaders , by name , and then they would be hit when located			1
the anatomy of @entity6 : how the ' @entity111 ' is run , from oil to beheadings intelligence is also collected by intercepting cell phone calls and monitoring social media sites that @entity6 frequents			0
all of this is being repeatedly collected over a period of days because the @entity0 also wants to see any patterns of movement			0
many of the targets are mobile , so they have to track them repeatedly			0
intelligence also has to be collected on any regime forces , or air defenses in the area where the @entity3 will fly			0
one important challenge : figuring out where civilians are located			0
intelligence indicates @entity6 has been moving into towns , hoping to blend in and keep safe from potential @entity3 airstrikes			1
@entity133 leader rips @entity6 , questions @entity3 willingness to ' sacrifice ' in terror fight all of this data is assembled for each target			1
then the @entity45 determines which type of aircraft and which type of bomb is best to strike the target			0
strikes are expected to use precision - guided weapons in order to minimize collateral damage , especially in towns and villages			0
those type of weapons can even be used to hit a precise part of a building rather than destroy an entire structure			0
each target on the list will include an assessment of the risk of flying into that area of @entity7 and hitting it , but also an assessment of how the destruction could impact @entity6			1
the @entity63 is looking for targets to make a significant impact on @entity6 , not just destroy small groups of personnel or weapons , military officials tell @entity1			1
@entity168 says @entity7 president is using chlorine weapons			2

military officials are prepared to strike , waiting on president @entity9 's go - ahead
@entity9 is " actively " reviewing target lists and has " offered guidance " to the @entity63
the @entity3 has been flying drones over @entity7 , looking at areas where @entity6 operates
if top @entity6 leaders can be located , they will be on the target list to strike
