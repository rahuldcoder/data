-- the idea of an amputee tinkling on piano keys with all the flair and grace of an able - handed person may seem like a futuristic fantasy			2
but watch @entity8 effortlessly arch and extend each finger on his bionic arm and you ca n't help but agree with him when he says : " the future is coming now			1
" its makers describe @entity8 's robotic limb as the most sophisticated of its kind in the world , recreating virtually every movement of a natural arm -- and all controlled by brain power			1
" when they took my arm i never thought i would have an actual hand -- i saw the hooks and thought that was exactly what i would be getting , " said @entity8 , who lost his left arm to cancer in 2008			1
" so once they introduced me to this , it was like something out of space come to @entity34			1
" explore the bionic body moving on up featuring 100 sensors , 26 joints , 17 motors and a tiny computer built into the palm of the robotic hand , the revolutionary @entity36 ( @entity36 ) is the work of researchers at @entity45 in @entity46			1
weighing four kilograms -- much like a normal arm -- it can mimic almost all the same movements			1
" this is the most sophisticated arm in the world , " said @entity49 , of the university 's @entity50			1
" what we have done is , by order of magnitude , increase the ability to do very highly dexterous kinds of motions			2
so you can think about things like eventually playing the piano ... i think we 'll get there someday			2
" the mpl is programmed to respond to electrical impulses in @entity8 's residual limb -- he simply has to think about moving his old arm			1
" you do n't even really think about it , " said @entity8			0
" you 're extending the arm , talking and doing other things -- it just automatically does it			1
" @entity74 for former baker @entity8 , the first step in the ground - breaking project was bringing to life the dead nerves at the end of his residual arm			2
@entity8 underwent targeted muscle reinnervation -- surgery that involves rewiring electrical signals in the stump			0
only 50 people in the world have had the operation , which takes a couple of hours			0
" we take all the electrical signals that are going down to the missing limb and reroute them into residual muscles that are still there , " said @entity89 , assistant professor of surgery , trauma and surgical critical care at the university			2
" now when @entity8 has a natural thought about moving that missing limb , he contracts that muscle and we are able to capture those signals and translate them into messages for the prosthetic limb			1
" within two weeks of surgery , @entity8 began to feel his phantom limb for the first time in years			1
he practiced moving it for 20 minutes each day , training the nerves for his new bionic arm			1
" the more you do it , the more the pathway is cleaned up and the cobwebs are out of it , " he said			0
" after the surgery i was constantly rubbing my stump to see what new feeling was coming in			0
i said ' wow i can feel my pinky finger			0
' i kept on doing it , and it was like ' oh right , i 've got a pointer			0
' " symphony of movement the ambitious bionic limb , seven years in the making , is incredibly lifelike in its movements , thanks to a complex symphony of muscle triggers			1
other robotic arms have relied on direct signals , whereas the @entity36 picks up a chorus of muscle motions -- creating a more fluid movement			0
" we are using a lot more electrode sites , " explained biomedical engineer @entity136			0
" that array of muscle contraction is more like a chord in music , so you are able to get more complexity of motion -- like you would get more complexity of sound			0
" looking good while many prosthetic limbs look lifelike , finding one that also moves naturally has proved more of a challenge			2
there are now plans to cover the @entity36 in a skin - like substance , which could make it the most inconspicuous artificial arm in history			2
" there is an elegance to it , and that is actually one of the most important things for the users of prosthetics , " said @entity49			0
" the natural movement is almost more important than the appearance			0
" indeed for @entity8 , the bionic arm feels just as natural as the arm he lost -- to the point where " every time i have to turn it back in , it 's like losing part of me all over again			1
" " i do a lot of handy work around the house , a lot of cooking , " he says			0
" and to be able to hold bowls and grab spoons is absolutely amazing			0
