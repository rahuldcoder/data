@entity0 -- the september 11 , 2001 , attacks have led to an intelligence community so large and unwieldy that it 's unmanageable and inefficient -- and no one knows how much it costs , according to a two - year investigation by the @entity6			1
ahead of the publication , many in the intelligence community worried that the stories would disclose too much information about contractors and the classified tasks they handle			1
the @entity6 article that appeared in monday 's edition says its investigation uncovered " a @entity17 hidden from public view and lacking in thorough oversight			1
after nine years of unprecedented spending and growth , the result is that the system put in place to keep the @entity25 safe is so massive that its effectiveness is impossible to determine			1
" @entity6 : @entity17 the @entity6 investigation found that " 33 building complexes for top - secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since september 2001 , " or the equivalent of nearly three @entity32			1
" some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism , homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the @entity25 , " according to the @entity6 , which added that an estimated 854,000 people hold top - secret security clearances			1
" there has been so much growth since 9/11 that getting your arms around that -- not just for the @entity49 [ director of national intelligence ] , but for any individual , for the director of the @entity53 , for the secretary of defense -- is a challenge , " defense secretary @entity43 told the @entity6 last week			1
" look , we know the intelligence community grew significantly and quickly after 9/11 , " a senior administration official told @entity1 monday			1
" some of it was inefficient			2
but we are looking at those inefficiencies			0
and remember , we have prevented attacks			0
" acting national intelligence director @entity62 issued a statement saying the @entity6 's report " does not reflect the intelligence community we know			1
" " in recent years , we have reformed the ( intelligence community ) in ways that have improved the quality , quantity , regularity , and speed of our support to policymakers , warfighters , and homeland defenders , and we will continue our reform efforts , " he said			1
" we provide oversight , while also encouraging initiative			1
we work constantly to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies , while preserving a degree of intentional overlap among agencies to strengthen analysis , challenge conventional thinking , and eliminate single points of failure			0
" the @entity6 said its investigation was " based on government documents and contracts , job descriptions , property records , corporate and social networking web sites , additional records , and hundreds of interviews with intelligence , military and corporate officials and former officials , " most of whom requested anonymity			2
although officials were concerned about the content of the newspaper articles ahead of publication , what troubled them the most was " interactive " component of the series , which they said lists the locations where the @entity53 , the @entity113 and the other agencies that make up the intelligence community have facilities			1
many of those sites are not publicly known , some officials said			0
officials worried about the security implications of such disclosures			0
as one person put it , " these are targeted places to begin with			0
... mapping it out presents counterterrorism and counterintelligence concerns			0
" the officials say there have been discussions with the @entity6 to make changes in the website			0
it was not immediately known what , if any , changes were made , but an interactive map available monday morning showed more than 2,000 government work locations and nearly 7,000 for private contractors			0
in two communications , officials asked the @entity6 not to publish addresses , the senior administration official said monday			0
there has been talk in @entity0 for some time that the @entity6 was working on an investigative series on the intelligence community			1
but it 's only been in recent days that the deep concern of the intelligence officials has become more apparent			1
the newspaper said it took steps to allay public safety concerns			2
" because of the nature of this project , we allowed government officials to see the web site several months ago and asked them to tell us of any specific concerns			0
they offered none at that time , " the @entity6 said in a message posted on its website			0
" as the project evolved , we shared the web site 's revised capabilities			2
again , we asked for specific concerns			0
one government body objected to certain data points on the site and explained why ; we removed those items			0
another agency objected that the entire web site could pose a national security risk but declined to offer specific comments			2
" the message from the @entity178 of the director of national intelligence that was obtained by @entity1 told contractors , " employees should be reminded that they must neither confirm nor deny information contained in this , or any , media publication			1
" it warned that foreign intelligence services , terrorist groups and " criminal elements " might want to use the information			2
" specifically , we recommend that companies affected by this publication and website assess and take steps to mitigate risk to their workforce , facility and mission , " including " re-enforcement of security and counterintelligence protections and steps to enhance workforce awareness			0
" similar messages from the military and other agencies also went out			0
@entity1 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			2
