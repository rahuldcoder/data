-- in an earthshaking 1965 speech to @entity3 and to the nation , president @entity1 spoke directly to the sinister forces that had restricted black @entity7 ' right to vote across the @entity8 -- laying out the goals of the @entity10 in the form of a command to this shameful cabal			1
" open your polling places to all your people			0
allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin			2
extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land , " @entity1 thundered			1
" there is no constitutional issue here			0
the command of the @entity28 is plain			0
" the speech stirred the country , moved the rev. @entity31 to tears and secured this essential law 's passage			1
today , if president @entity35 wants to save the @entity10 following tuesday 's shameful @entity37 ruling , then he faces an even bigger challenge than @entity1 did : he 's got to convince a much more hostile @entity3 that the act is worth saving			1
hanging in the balance is the very foundation of @entity7 civil rights law			0
on tuesday , nearly 50 years after @entity1 's historic speech , the five conservative members of the @entity37 eviscerated the @entity10 in a single stroke			1
why ? according to the majority opinion , apparently it 's because the discriminatory anti-voter rules the act prohibits are n't as much of a problem as they were before the law was passed			1
if you 're trying to think up a way to illustrate how completely nuts that is , do n't worry , because justice @entity56 already put it best in her dissent			0
striking down this essential part of the act , @entity56 wrote , " is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet			0
" opinion : how segregation got busted of course , @entity1 was right in 1965 , and he 's just as right today			1
these protections are vital and necessary			0
there is no right more sacrosanct to the very foundations of our nation than the right to vote , and threats to equal voting loom every time we turn a blind eye			2
constant vigilance is required to safeguard it , and for half a century the @entity10 was a watchful guardian			2
but now that @entity81 's " pre-clearance " formula has been made irrelevant , it falls to @entity3 to fix it			1
do n't expect the conservative - controlled @entity83 to jump at the chance though			0
just last year , during the 2012 election cycle , @entity85 elected officials in states across the country pushed deeply hostile voter id laws that disproportionately limit minority voters			1
sometimes , the @entity85 were even explicit that the purpose of these laws was to put victories in the " @entity96 " column			0
and all that took place with a full and complete @entity10 still on the books			2
veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost now it 's up to @entity35 to make a new case for a new @entity10			1
of course , there 's nothing partisan about equality in the ballot box			0
the act 's great virtue is that it barred discrimination no matter which way it was directed			2
it was an equal opportunity shield from injustice -- protecting you no matter who you voted for or what you looked like			0
it is a crying shame that the @entity37 left a key part of @entity1 's legacy in tatters			1
but today , @entity35 -- and every fair - minded @entity7 -- should look to the spirit of @entity1 and @entity31 and pass a new @entity10 that will stand the test of time			1
@entity126 is just around the corner			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			2

@entity130 : @entity1 's 1965 speech *enjoined* @entity8 to support blacks ' right to vote
she says the @entity37 , in a stroke , has eviscerated the @entity10
@entity130 : president @entity35 must convince polarized @entity3 to save the act by fixing it
voter id laws show threats to rights remain , and @entity3 must pass new act , she says
