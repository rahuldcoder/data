@entity0 , @entity1 -- by now , the entire country has gotten the message that @entity5 are angry and frustrated over illegal immigration			1
but , oddly enough , the anger and frustration is n't usually aimed at the illegal immigrants themselves			0
many @entity5 would probably admit that , if they were unable to feed their families in their home country , they too might venture out in search of employment			1
and , if they were faced with waits of 10 to 15 years to enter another country legally , you can bet many of them would enter illegally			0
what really gets @entity5 fired up are three things : the feeling that they 're under siege by spillover violence from @entity25 drug cartels , the concern that the @entity28 government is n't doing enough to protect them , and indignation that people in other states are judging them for responding to a reality most of us ca n't imagine			1
that 's what you hear on talk radio and what you read in the letters section of local newspapers			2
and that 's also pretty much the view of @entity43 , a top - notch political and public affairs consultant and a familiar fixture in @entity1 @entity46 circles			2
@entity43 served as chief of staff to former gov. @entity48 in the 1990s and counsels gov. @entity49 today			0
he 's a vocal defender of the state 's new immigration law , @entity52			1
what i wanted to know is whether that 's because he really believes in the measure or whether he 's just being a good soldier for the state @entity46 , given that just about every prominent @entity46 official in the state backs the law			1
as we met for what became a three - hour dinner in a @entity0 restaurant , i soon had my answer			1
@entity43 began the conversation with a piece of advice			0
" if you 're going to write about this issue with credibility , " he said , " you have to acknowledge the reality of the violence caused by the @entity25 drug cartels and the inability of the @entity25 government to contain it			1
the new bogeyman of the immigration debate is the @entity25 drug cartels			2
in fact , when you engage a supporter of @entity52 , it 's hard to get them to talk about anything else			2
the cartels are their strong card ; why not play it ? one of the arguments floating about -- advanced by @entity49 -- is that most illegal immigrants act as drug mules for the cartels			1
too bad @entity49 ca n't seem to find anyone to back that up			0
@entity1 sen. @entity94 said he does n't believe that most illegal immigrants are used as drug mules			1
neither does @entity97 , head of the @entity98 , the labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents			0
@entity97 said @entity49 's claims are " clearly not the case " and " do n't comport with reality			2
" @entity43 is too smart to repeat wild claims			0
instead , he stayed focused on public perception			0
he submits that most of the support for the measure --- polls show that about 55 percent of @entity5 back the law , down from 70 percent when @entity49 signed it in april -- is coming from people who are sincerely afraid that @entity25 is spinning out of control because of the drug war and that the chaos is spilling into @entity1 in the form of kidnappings and other lawlessness			1
according to law enforcement authorities , in 2008 , nearly 400 kidnappings happened in @entity0			1
but a prosecutor told me that most people do n't understand that many of these " kidnappings " are n't for ransom			0
rather , they 're an extension of the human smuggling industry , in which rival coyotes raid each other 's " drop houses " and steal the cargo			2
that 's a serious crime , and yet it 's probably not what most people think about when they hear the word " kidnapping			1
" @entity0 police chief @entity138 , a vocal opponent of the immigration law , insists that he has the manpower to investigate each kidnapping			1
but , he warns , that could change if the portions of @entity52 struck down by a federal judge come back to life like the mythical bird that shares the city 's name			1
if his officers have to make immigration enforcement their top priority , @entity138 said , other crimes will probably go unsolved			0
then , the crime rate could soar			0
right now , the crime rate in @entity0 is down			1
" despite all the hype , " spokesman @entity157 told the @entity158 , " in every single reportable crime category , we 're significantly down			0
" in the first quarter of 2010 , violent crime was down 17 percent in the city , while homicides were down 38 percent and robberies 27 percent , compared with the same time period in 2009			0
the @entity168 also confirms it			0
the number of violent crimes has fallen every year in @entity0 since 2006 , the @entity168 reports			1
it 's part of an overall trend in which , according to the bureau , crime rates are actually going down in cities that have large immigrant populations it 's pretty obvious that cynical politicians -- all of whom happen to be @entity46 -- are exaggerating the fear factor to cover up what they recognize as some of the more unseemly motives of @entity52 supporters			1
although @entity43 does n't deny that some of the folks who have rallied around the law are motivated by anxiety over changing demographics , he would n't admit that this has anything to do with race and ethnicity			1
but is n't that obvious ? for the past two decades , there has been a loud chorus of worry about how @entity202 immigrants are changing @entity0 -- and , according to some , not for the better			1
those feelings did n't just go away			0
and the people who hold them are almost certainly part of the pro- 1070 brigade			0
not everyone who wants to get rid of illegal immigrants does so because he or she sees a connection to the drug cartels			0
in fact , most people just want to preserve the @entity28 they grew up with			0
besides , if they really want to put drug dealers out of business , the best way is to support @entity25 president @entity219 , who has declared war on these criminal syndicates and yet vehemently opposes the @entity1 law			2
instead , @entity46 candidates for office are running tv ads in @entity1 criticizing @entity219 for criticizing the law			0
that makes absolutely no sense , just as it makes no sense for @entity1 to crack down on illegal immigrants in the hopes that it will somehow get rid of drug dealers			0
unless , of course , the real objective all along has been something much sneakier : to use the fear of drug dealers to get rid of illegal immigrants			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240			2

@entity240 : @entity5 upset about drug violence , government 's *inaction*
defenders say law helps fight drug violence , he says , but crime down in @entity0
governor said most illegals used as drug mules , he says , which is untrue
@entity240 says *scare* *tactics* used to justify bias against ethnicity , fear of change
