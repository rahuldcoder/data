-- president @entity1 has repeatedly stated , " we are tougher than the times we live in			1
" although the president may not have intended to signal a whole new approach to our future , the line has churchillian implications			2
speaking of tough times , he could call on @entity11 to recognize we face at least a decade of rough sledding , ask us to face the challenges and express confidence that we shall prevail			1
the tough times approach differs radically from the prevailing wisdom that if we merely did @entity17 , we would be rolling in clover again			1
all we need to do is cut deficits , reduce taxes some more and lighten up on regulations , and the nation will be back on the right course			0
others foresee the bottoming out of the housing market , within two years or so , as the turning point to recovery			1
@entity29 economist @entity28 argues that intentionally inflating the dollar is the " the only practical way to shorten the coming period of painful deleveraging and slow growth			0
" in general , politicians prefer president @entity38 's manner , which was oozing with optimism			1
and they are leery of sounding like president @entity40 , who spoke of malaise and called for sacrifices			0
the @entity11 people must be prepared for what is coming , or they will lash out with even more anger against failed promises			1
take the most elementary issue : nobody reasonable , on the right or the left , denies that we lived beyond our means for decades , financing our indulgence by taking loans from the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , among others , as well as hocking the assets of our future generations			1
now the time has come that we must pay back , and that means reducing the deficit			2
such payback means , by definition , that while we once could float a lifestyle that cost , say , 120 % of what we earned , now we shall have to do with lifestyle that costs , say , 80 % of our income , with the rest going to pay down what we owe			2
after decades of indulgence and accumulating debt , our accounts can not be settled in a few years			1
according to a report in @entity80 , using recent @entity78 projections , the debt could reach $ 13 trillion in 10 years			1
even if we get the " grand bargain " and $ 2 trillion to $ 4 trillion is cut , that means the 10 - year deficit could still remain between $ 9 trillion and $ 11 trillion			1
true , we do not have to bring it down to zero , but we still have quite a burden with which to contend			0
if we must pay for that deficit by raising taxes , we will have less money			0
if we must cut services , such as health care , to pay down the debt , people will have to buy these services themselves			0
and we should pay down our personal debt for our own future and that of our children			0
that means for the next decade or even longer , @entity11 will have to do with less , from buying new clothes to going on vacations			1
i am hardly the only one who foresees a " lost decade			0
" a recent @entity104 magazine article argues that even by 2011 , 2012 , even 2014 , the employment rate may decline very little and describes the current economic climate as " a trauma that will remain heavy for quite some time			0
" @entity108 of the @entity109 predicts that " many factors are pushing against a quick recovery			2
... things will come back			0
but it 's going to take a long time			2
" frustration to such shortfalls is mounting			0
a recent @entity117 poll found that 72 % of the people who responded think the country is on the wrong course economically			0
the president 's approval rating is tanking , but that of @entity124 is even lower			2
a @entity127 / @entity126 poll found that only a paltry 12 % of respondents approved of @entity124			0
as i see it , " @entity132 " can do relatively little to spare @entity11 at least 10 years of austerity			1
but , public leaders can prepare people for what is coming and make a virtue out of doing with less , of paying back what we owe even if it hurts â € ” without implying that recovery is right around the corner or that something drastic can be done so we will not have to pay more taxes and do with less services			0
if it turns out that @entity148 is much nearer than i expect , then people prepared for " tough times " will rejoice			2
but if they believe the economy will bounce back quickly , and in reality face prolonged austerity , we must expect even more angry outbursts			2
we 've avoided the violent demonstrations seen in @entity155 , the massive demonstrations against inequality seen in @entity158 and the random torching of cars common in riots in @entity162 , @entity163 or @entity58			0
if @entity1 can speak candidly about the coming tough times and the shortfalls we all will have to accept as part of the cure , he may do better ; we most assuredly will			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			1

@entity170 : despite promises and *proposals* , there is no quick fix for economy
@entity1 's " we are tougher than the times we live in " should be a policy , he *writes*
@entity170 : @entity11 will have to do with less and sacrifice for at least 10 years
he says years of indulgence , living beyond our means will take years to redress
