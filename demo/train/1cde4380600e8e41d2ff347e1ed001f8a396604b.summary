-- when a website that claims more than a half - billion monthly visitors gets hacked , users pay attention			2
so when we wrote thursday about hackers who published login information for more than 450,000 @entity11 users , readers had plenty to say about it			1
dozens of your comments hovered around a central theme : who still uses @entity11 anyway ? @entity18 said : " hmmm , i may be on that list			1
except that it would be so old , the email and password would n't get you anywhere			2
have not logged into a yahoo account in years			0
do n't even remember what email address it would have had			0
" @entity29 : " i 'm surprised that many people still use @entity11			1
wonder if those same users still have 8 - track tapes too ? " prelude066 : " who still has a yahoo account ? over 50 year old white guys who have n't checked it in 6 years ... " @entity11 may not have the digital sex appeal it did back in the glory days of the ' 90s dotcom boom			1
and , to be sure , recent months have been tough on the venerable web giant			0
the company cut 2,000 jobs in april as part of an overhaul by then - ceo @entity44			1
then , less than a month later , @entity44 himself was out after the discovery that he had padded his resume with a phony college degree			0
but having been perhaps the @entity50 's first major portal , @entity11 holds onto a massive worldwide base of users			1
its e-mail service is the world 's second-most popular , behind @entity56 's @entity55 , although @entity58 's @entity57 has been gaining big chunks of ground in recent years			0
many of you blamed @entity11 for not having taken tougher security measures : sixnard : " what 's annoying is that there are companies who do this right , but so many other companies who are n't paying attention			1
@entity73 , for example , assumes that their systems will be broken into despite all precautions , and it stores personal information encrypted and on separate servers so multiple break - ins and extensive correlation would be needed to obtain useful information			0
" they also report break - ins when they occur with full details , so anyone else who 's interested can take steps to prevent further exploits			2
people know how to do this , they just chose not to			2
in a written statement thursday , @entity11 said they were fixing the exploit the hackers used and changing the passwords of users who were hit			1
they said that less than 5 % of the breached e-mail accounts had their active passwords attached to them			2
some readers felt like the story was overblown and that hacks like this are , unfortunately , part of online life : garyguy : " seems only the biggies get headlines			1
actually there were new reports today that an @entity108 forum and an @entity110 forum were also hacked			0
it 's getting to the point where you 'll need a password to use your password			0
" @entity116 : " there are always security risks in technology and communication			0
that does n't mean we should all retreat to the @entity124 and start sending out information on stone tablets			0
over-react much ? " and , of course , some of you decided to have some fun with it : @entity137 : " now someone can finally respond to that @entity134 lawyer who wants give me $ 12 million if i just give him my checking acct number ... " @entity138 : " oh great now someone is going to make fantasy football trades without my knowledge " finally , on a more useful note , many readers wanted to know where they could find out if their account was one of the ones that was compromised			1
@entity148 is not linking to the hackers ' web page			2
but security firm @entity151 has created a page with a tool it says will tell users whether their e-mail address was leaked .			0

@entity0 readers respond to news of hackers who exposed 450,000 @entity11 accounts
many felt @entity11 could have done more to prevent the leak
others say the story was overblown , that hacks are a part of online life
many *jokesters* say : people still use @entity11 ?
