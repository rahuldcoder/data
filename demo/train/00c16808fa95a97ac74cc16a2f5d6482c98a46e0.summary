five @entity1 presidential candidates are boycotting a proposed @entity3 debate because of what they say were unethical reporting practices by the spanish - language network in how it handled a story concerning @entity1 sen. @entity8 of @entity9			1
@entity3 tuesday denied allegations that it told @entity8 it might not broadcast a story about his brother - in - law 's 24 - year - old drug conviction if the freshman senator appeared on " @entity16 , " one of the network 's news programs			1
@entity3 has called the allegations " absurd " and says its july story of the drug bust was reported fairly and accurately			1

" @entity3 did not offer to soften or ignore the report about an anti-drug raid that involved the family of sen. @entity8			1
we would never make such an offer with any protagonist in a news report and we did not make an offer in this case			0
" @entity8 , the former @entity9 @entity40 speaker , is a freshman senator and a star among @entity1 , who talk about him as a possible running mate on the @entity1 ticket next year			2

" rep. @entity60 , a close friend of @entity8 , told @entity61 wednesday that he had talked with @entity8 and his family members " minute by minute as the incident was occurring			0
" " i do n't think the staffers of @entity8 's office were ... inventing those details			0
they were very , very clear details			0
... it was a clear exchange of having the exclusive interview with the senator and that way , not airing the report about the relative of @entity8 , " the @entity1 congressman said			1
the allegations against @entity3 prompted three @entity77 @entity1 leaders in @entity9 to call for the @entity1 presidential candidates to boycott @entity3 's proposed debate in late january in the @entity9 , just before @entity9 holds its presidential primary			1
the candidates who have agreed to boycott the debate are former @entity84 gov. @entity83 , @entity86 gov. @entity85 , former @entity88 gov. @entity87 , businessman and former @entity90 ceo @entity89 , and rep. @entity91 of @entity92			0
