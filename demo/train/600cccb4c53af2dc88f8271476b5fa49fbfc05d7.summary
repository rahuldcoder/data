@entity0 , @entity1 -- facing his former deputy whose attempted defection to the @entity5 sealed both men 's fate , fallen high - flying politician @entity9 continued his defiant stance saturday as his increasingly dramatic trial stretched into a third day			1
the former @entity13 chief of the sprawling south - western metropolis of @entity16 denied abusing his power -- the third and final charge heard in court stemming from his actions after @entity21 , then the city 's police chief , told @entity9 that local police were investigating his wife @entity25 for murder			1
prosecutors accuse @entity9 of threatening and improperly firing @entity21 upon learning of the murder investigation , causing @entity21 to seek asylum in the @entity5 consulate in a nearby city in early february 2012 , and triggering the greatest political crisis for the @entity13 in decades			2
" i have made mistakes			0
i feel regret and i 'm willing to take responsibility , " @entity9 , 64 , was quoted as saying in a transcript released by the @entity19 in eastern @entity1 , where he is also being tried for bribe - taking and embezzlement			2
" but whether or not i 've committed a crime is a different issue			0
" " i did n't bend the law to protect @entity25 , " he said			0
" i did n't force @entity21 out or force him to defect to the @entity5			0
" @entity9 did acknowledge slapping @entity21 in the face -- a key moment long considered a turning point in the two men 's relationship -- during a confrontation , claiming he was furious at his " double - faced " deputy who had faked his loyalty to the @entity51			1
taking the witness stand , @entity21 described an even more disturbing sequence of events in @entity9 's office a day after he told his boss about the murder investigation in late january 2012			1
" he started verbally assaulting me ... and about three minutes later , he walked around the left side of his desk and stood in front me			0
he suddenly attacked me with his fist , hitting on my left ear -- it was not just a slap , " @entity21 recalled , according to a court transcript			0
" my body shook a little ... and i found blood at the corner of my mouth and discharge in my ear , " he continued			0
" i wiped the blood off with a tissue , but when he heard me calmly tell him again that he had to face the reality , he threw a glass on the ground while saying ' i 'll never accept it			0
' " @entity21 told prosecutors that @entity9 's physical violence against him as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators led to his decision to seek refuge in the @entity5 diplomatic mission in @entity85			1
when @entity9 was allowed to question the witness , @entity21 revealed in an exchange that @entity25 had told him about her intention to kill a day before the murder			1
and when @entity9 asked @entity21 : " did you think i was forcing you out in an attempt to cover up ( my wife 's murder ) case ? " @entity21 replied : " yes			1
" embezzlement and corruption charges earlier saturday , @entity9 kept up his vigorous defence against embezzlement charges and , as he did friday on corruption charges , dismissed testimony from his jailed wife as a desperate attempt to reduce her own sentencing , prompting observers to revel in the intimate details of the extravagant life of an estranged couple once called " the @entity107 of @entity1			1
" @entity25 is serving a suspended death sentence for killing @entity110 businessman and family friend @entity111 in a @entity16 hotel room in november 2011			0
she gave her testimony to the court via video and has said that @entity9 was well aware of multimillion - dollar dealings to fund their and their younger son 's jet - setting lifestyle			1
" i have feelings for @entity25 , " @entity9 said saturday morning , after admitting to an extramarital affair			1
" she is a vulnerable woman ... and who else could she turn in ? that 's why all accusations against me originated from her			0
" prosecutors allege that @entity9 received five million renminbi ( $ 820,000 ) of public funds from a local urban planning official in @entity130 , @entity131 , in the early 2000s when he was mayor and later the provincial governor			1
@entity9 slammed the allegations as " contradictory " and denied that he needed to take the money as his wife earned millions of dollars from her five law firms			2
under the bribery indictment , prosecutors accuse @entity9 of using his political posts to secure influence for others			1
they say that between 2000 and 2012 , @entity9 , @entity142 and their son , @entity143 , received about 22 million renminbi ( $ 3.6 million ) in bribes from businessmen in @entity130			2
timeline : @entity9 scandal @entity9 's fall from grace @entity9 is a princeling , a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence			1
his late father , @entity155 , was a revolutionary contemporary of @entity157 and former leader @entity158			0
over the past three decades , @entity9 rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the @entity162 , the powerful policymaking body of the @entity13			2
a charismatic and urbane politician , @entity9 was credited with a spectacular , albeit brutal , crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of @entity16			1
@entity9 's glittering career , in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies , fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder , corruption and betrayal			2
ex-police chief @entity21 's attempted defection precipitated @entity9 's political demise			2
soon after news of the events began to emerge , @entity9 was removed from his party posts			2
after his wife 's sentencing last august , @entity21 was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends , defection , abuse of power and bribe - taking			0
he received a 15 - year prison sentence			0
@entity9 's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal			1
his high profile and connections among the nation 's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for @entity1 authorities			1
it 's taken more than a year , during which time the @entity13 underwent a major leadership change , to bring him to trial			2
many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a pre-planned script , seeing the trial 's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between @entity9 and @entity1 's top leaders			1
but as he often did in his political career , @entity9 has so far stolen the show , mounting a robust attack on the prosecution 's case and ridiculing witness testimony			1
that has left @entity1 watchers trying to figure out how far he 's veered off script			0
journalists from the international news media have n't been allowed inside the courtroom			0
but the court 's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside , attracting almost half a million followers on @entity232 , @entity1 's @entity233 - like service			0
@entity2 has n't been able to verify how accurate and comprehensive the court 's version of proceedings has been			0
but many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close , albeit filtered , account			0
@entity2 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 contributed to this report .			0

@entity9 trial wraps up third day saturday in @entity0
the former top official has mounted a tough defense against bribery charges
so far , @entity9 has stolen the show , attacking prosecution 's case and ridiculing testimony
