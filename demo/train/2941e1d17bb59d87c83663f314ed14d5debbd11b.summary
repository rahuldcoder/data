on a political level , it was a powerful @entity2 nation playing host to a people whose cause it supports			0
as a sporting contest , it was a one - way procession as @entity10 's national football team warmed up for next week 's @entity12 qualifier with a 7 - 0 thrashing of an under - strength @entity15 side			1
@entity10 's rulers support @entity15 's claims for statehood on the condition that @entity21 is dissolved -- a " cancer cell " that needs to be removed , according to president @entity23 -- and wednesday 's friendly match in @entity25 highlighted some of the difficulties the @entity28 face			1
the team traveled to @entity10 soon after @entity25 hosted a five - day international conference in support of @entity15 intifada -- or uprising -- attended by its @entity36 and other @entity35 allies			1
they arrived at @entity38 without any players who hold @entity21 documents -- a significant chunk of the squad -- and predictably struggled to hold off an @entity10 side featuring some of @entity46 football 's biggest names			1
having kept the match scoreless until first - half injury - time , a headed goal from @entity48 opened the floodgates and six more followed after the interval			0
@entity53 , @entity54 ( with a penalty ) , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 made it 6 - 0			2
@entity56 completed the rout at the end with another penalty after @entity15 's goalkeeper was sent off for a second booking			2
an @entity66 soccer star playing for @entity15 the match will not count in @entity69 's world rankings , as @entity10 coach @entity70 brought on a seventh substitute -- one more than is allowed for " a " internationals			1
but it was one more step for the @entity28 , who hosted their first competitive home match in march			0
the team lost in the second round of @entity46 qualifying matches for the @entity79 , and also in the second round of regional qualifiers for the @entity82			0
@entity10 , by contrast , is top of @entity85 in the third round ahead of second - placed @entity88 's visit to @entity25 on tuesday			1
" the @entity28 have long used football to form an idea of a nation , " @entity2 football expert @entity89 told @entity90			0
" @entity69 are one of the few organizations to have recognized an entity called @entity15 , and their mere existence is a chance to fly the flag abroad			0
" the fact that the head of the @entity102 is a man called @entity103 , @entity104 's national security adviser and one of the highest - ranked men in @entity107 , tells you that they take the team -- and the power that football has to invoke national unity and foreign propaganda -- very seriously indeed			2
" @entity89 , author of the book " when friday comes : football in the @entity119 , " said the friendly match gave @entity23 a chance to show his support for @entity15 's cause			1
" he has often used football for political ends , like before the 2006 @entity12 when he used the team 's popularity to boost his dwindling support , " @entity89 said			1
" but it can backfire			0
the terraces in @entity10 have also become a crucible for opposition to unpopular policies in a country with very few outlets for dissent			0
" @entity15 are on the up			0
after years of a debilitating @entity21 occupation , they now have a pro league , a women 's team and a national squad that came close to qualifying for the group stage of @entity46 qualification for the @entity82			2
" @entity10 's golden generation has passed , but under @entity70 they hope to return to the glory days when they made it to @entity146 ' 98 and famously put @entity147 to the sword			2
