more federal prisoners serving sentences for non-violent crimes can apply for clemency after the @entity4 announced new rules wednesday			1
deputy attorney general @entity6 announced that the department would broaden the criteria for clemency , a move that is expected to lead to thousands of prisoners -- most serving drug sentences -- filing applications to president @entity14 seeking to commute their sentences			1
the changes are part of a broader effort by the @entity14 administration to modify sentencing laws , allowing for use of rehabilitation and other alternatives to deal with non-violent drug offenders and those who previously faced tough mandatory minimum sentences			1
attorney general @entity27 previewed some of the changes monday by announcing plans to assign more lawyers to handle an anticipated flood of clemency requests			0
crack cocaine at heart of once - common sentencing disparity " we are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates , candidates who have a clean prison record , do not present a threat to public safety , and were sentenced under out - of - date laws that have since been changed , and are no longer seen as appropriate , " @entity6 said at a news conference			1
the clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions : they must be low - level , non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today			1
they must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison , with no history of violence before or during their prison term			0
the pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort @entity27 calls " @entity64 , " which also seeks to remedy the once - common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine , based on guidelines first enacted by @entity70 more than 25 years ago			2
earlier : @entity27 seeks to cut mandatory minimum drug sentences of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system , some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners			1
but the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications			0
the @entity4 says it does n't know how many people will end up qualifying because it depends on the applications and how they fit the new criteria			1
the president has final authority to decide who gets clemency			0
@entity14 has been criticized by some civil rights groups for being stingy with his pardons and commutations			0
but many praised the @entity4 's decision as a good initial step , including a coalition of groups working on sentencing guidelines			1
the announcement " marks the beginning of the end of the age of mass incarceration , " said @entity96 , president of the @entity97			1
" we must seize this historic opportunity to start the process of remedying decades of cruel and unnecessarily harsh sentencing policies			0
" @entity6 also announced the appointment of @entity108 to lead the department 's @entity109 , which has come under fire for being slow to review a backlog of applications			1
@entity6 said the department was setting up an online application system and working with pro-bono attorneys who will assist prisoners in their applications			1
@entity119 , general counsel for the group @entity120 , which advocates for changes to drug sentencing laws , welcomed @entity6 's announcement			2
" the doors of the @entity109 have been closed to petitioners for too long			0
this announcement signals a truly welcome change ; the culture of ' no ' that has dominated that office is being transformed , " she said			2
the push to relax sentencing laws has the support of some conservative @entity135 lawmakers , who believe it is a way to reduce spending on federal prisons and to use alternatives to incarceration to deal with drug problems			2
however , lawmakers want the changes to be made through @entity70 rather than through the president 's executive power			0
" i hope president @entity14 is not seeking to change sentencing policy unilaterally			0
@entity70 , not the president , has authority to make sentencing policy			0
he should continue to work with @entity70 rather than once again going it alone , and i 'm willing to work with the president on these issues			0
" sen. @entity155 , @entity156 , said this week			0
@entity6 , in his remarks wednesday , said the issue is one of fairness			2
" older , stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today 's laws erode people 's confidence in our criminal justice system , and i am confident that this initiative will go far to promote the most fundamental of @entity171 ideals -- equal justice under law , " @entity6 said			1
three years ago , @entity14 signed the @entity174 to address the larger issue of drug sentencing disparities			0
sentencing guidelines provided for a 100 - to - 1 ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine , but the fair sentencing law reduced the disparity to 18 - to - 1 .			2
