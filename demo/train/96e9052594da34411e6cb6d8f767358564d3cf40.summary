-- extended unemployment benefits will temporarily expire for thousands of @entity2 on monday because the @entity3 went on its spring recess without approving a one - month deadline extension			1
the extension , which had bipartisan support , would have cost about $ 10 billion , but a lone @entity9 , sen. @entity10 , said no until the costs are offset			0
the @entity13 senator objected to a commonly used unanimous - consent agreement to pass the bill under emergency conditions , even if it increases the federal deficit			2
@entity10 wants to eliminate additional government spending to pay for the bill			0
" the legitimate debate is whether we borrow and steal from our kids or we get out of town and send the bill to our kids for something that we 're going to consume today , " @entity10 said on the @entity3 floor			1

" @entity10 on monday refuted the notion he single - handedly blocked the extension , noting that he voted to stay in session to work out the issue			1
" @entity40 had several opportunities to extend these benefits in a fiscally - responsible manner before our @entity45 break but rejected all of them			1
it 's time for @entity40 to do what 's right for both the unemployed and future generations and do the hard work of paying for important priorities , " he said in a statement			2
@entity31 on monday also pointed the finger at congressional @entity55 for going on recess before agreeing to a solution that was fully paid for			1
" i am disappointed that the @entity55 continue to play political games to avoid paying for these benefits that are so important to the many struggling families across our nation who rely on them to make ends meet while they search for work			1
clearly , the @entity55 do n't want to help the unemployed unless they can increase the deficit while they 're doing it , " he said in a statement			1
asked whether president @entity68 believes that the benefits extension should be paid for , @entity70 , one of @entity68 's top economic advisers , said , " he believes that in an emergency , families who are depending on unemployment insurance to buy medicine for their kids should not have that unemployment insurance cut off			1
" " we believe that we need to approach these issues in their totality , with a fiscal framework that assures that we are getting to a much lower budget deficit , " @entity70 , the head of the @entity79 , said sunday on @entity0 's " @entity80			0
" the unemployment benefits provision was a part of the @entity88 of 2010 , which affects other programs , too			1
the @entity3 's inaction means lapses in funding for @entity93 , @entity95 payments to doctors and the @entity97 , among other things			1
the @entity3 is expected to take up the measure after lawmakers return from recess the week of april 12			1
@entity55 said they hope to pass a retroactive extension , compensating the unemployed for a gap in funding			2
if approved , it would be the seventh time the deadline has been extended since june 2008			2
which programs did @entity40 leave unfunded ? for the meantime , @entity55 are furious			2
at 4.1 percent , the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the country			2
" there are a whole lot of people in this country that are unemployed , and if ever there was a need to extend unemployment insurance , it is now			2
we ca n't do that to the most vulnerable people in this country , " he said			0
at least 212,000 @entity2 will be affected monday			1
@entity127 , an unemployed aerospace engineer , said @entity10 's argument that the nation 's children will carry the burden does n't resonate with him because his kids are being affected right now			0
" this is my children			0
for right now , they are affected , " he said			0
" it makes no sense , " he said , adding that his children need the money now			0
@entity140 , a personal trainer who is out of work , agreed with @entity127 , saying that the future is on the line today			0
" having people give up their future dreams and trying to save money for a better working car or better career or a better education -- that is the future			0
