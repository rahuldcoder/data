-- @entity1 has some simple advice for anyone looking to improve morale at their organization -- even if it 's not the easiest advice to follow			2
@entity8 deputy director @entity1 calls @entity9 " a bolt of lightning " for his staff " i say to them , jokingly , ' why do n't you try winning the @entity15 ? ' " he said			1
@entity1 , deputy director general of the @entity8 , knows what he 's talking about			1
the organization , based in @entity18 , @entity19 , and dedicated to the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power , was awarded the prize in 2005			1
president @entity23 was the surprise winner friday of this year 's peace prize			1
but for most of this week 's other winners , the honor marks a leap from relative obscurity to a spot in the international limelight			2
@entity1 said the scientists , authors , activists and others receiving @entity9 honors this week should be prepared for an experience that will change their lives in the months and years that follow			1
" the day that it was announced that we were winning the @entity15 , i can assure you that it was like a bolt of lightning that went through this place in terms of energizing staff and giving people a sense of self - worth , " he said			1
" it was absolutely remarkable			0
" in all , 172 people and 33 organizations were nominated for the peace prize -- although the @entity56 , @entity57 - based @entity9 committee had not announced who its finalists were			1
the peace prize is one of five awards handed out annually by the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64			1
the other four prizes are for physiology or medicine , physics , chemistry and literature			0
starting in 1969 , the @entity71 also has been awarded			0
the peace prize is the last of the awards to be announced this week and the @entity76 prize will be awarded monday			1
even for an organization like the @entity8 , a @entity79 affiliate that traces its roots back to 1957 , things were never the same after receiving the revered award , @entity1 said			1
" many , many things changed , " he said			0
" the number of applications we had for positions here , which was already high , skyrocketed			2
people returned phone calls very quickly			0
the whole spectrum of things of that nature changed			0
" @entity93 , a media specialist with the agency , remembers the day it received the @entity9 -- she was on vacation and asleep on her sister 's floor in @entity99 when it was announced			2
" for three years running , we had been sitting on the edges of our chairs hoping that we won , " she said			2
" that year , for some reason , we thought , ' oh , forget it			0
we 're not going to get it			0
' " the trip back to @entity18 would have taken her too long to handle the initial rush of attention , so she finished her vacation , with family members introducing her as " the @entity15 winner " for the rest of the week			2
months later , @entity115 said , she was still working to keep up with a flood of media interest in the agency spurred by the award			0
she said that , four years later , the award still contributes to a feeling of unity among the agency 's more - than 2,000 employees who come from over 100 different countries			0
" that flush of excitement , unfortunately , it goes away with time , " she said			0
" [ but ] you do get reminded			0
you walk through the corridor and you see that certificate hanging -- it 's acknowledgement that what we do is incredibly important			0
" the @entity9 recipient receives a prize of 10 million @entity64 crowns , or about $ 1.4 million , another life - changer for many recipients			1
but @entity1 said it 's the recognition of what the @entity9 panel called the " incalculable value " of his agency 's work that helps when employees are having a hard time with their sometimes slow , frustrating work			1
" i think it 's a continuing energizer for our staff , " he said .			2
