" the amount of destruction , the damage to people 's houses , the damage to neighborhoods , the damage to roads , the damage to our much beloved open space -- it 's pretty significant and , as i said , it 's extraordinarily widespread			1
" how to help like many , @entity200 wants to return home			0
but pictures from his neighborhood in @entity52 show cars buried in mud , and a huge hole that was once a road			0
" the cops and firefighters said it would probably take two to three weeks before they can build a bridge and we can get our vehicles out			0

an uphill climb ... fueled by a @entity1 spirit that does n't give up			0
in @entity52 , the @entity217 family surveyed the incredible damage to their home , inundated by water and mud			0
