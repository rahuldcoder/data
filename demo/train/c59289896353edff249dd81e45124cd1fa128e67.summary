-- the @entity1 on monday handed over control of a @entity1 - run prison near @entity4 to @entity6 authorities			1
the handover of control of the detention center in @entity10 fulfills an agreement between defense secretary @entity12 and @entity6 president @entity13			1
the detention facility has been a sticking point between @entity1 and @entity6 authorities , and tensions over the facility re-emerged this month with sharp words from @entity13 that the commander of @entity22 's @entity21 called " inflammatory			1
" the handover deal was reached saturday , but came a full year after the initial plan was announced by @entity1 and @entity6 authorities			1
the original plan called for the prison and detainees to be handed over with six months , but in september , the @entity1 " paused " the transfer of detainees , which include suspected @entity32 militants and insurgents			2
the @entity1 military has not publicly discussed the specifics of the dispute			2
but a military official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , told @entity0 last year that the @entity1 was holding on to several detainees over concerns about whether @entity6 authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released			1
@entity13 has been adamant that all prisoners be under @entity6 control			2
last year , he called the @entity1 failure to hand over all detainees at the facility a " serious breach " in the deal outlining the transfer of power from @entity1 forces to @entity6			1
tensions between the @entity22 - led coalition forces -- especially those from the @entity1 -- and @entity13 have escalated since a bomb blast in @entity60 earlier this month that killed nine people			0
@entity13 said afterward that there are " ongoing daily talks between @entity32 , @entity1 and foreigners in @entity65 and in the @entity66			0
" the comment effectively claimed the @entity1 was trying to foment continued violence inside @entity6 , and it was quickly denounced by @entity22 and @entity1 officials			2
some experts say @entity13 's comments have been fueled by frustration over the detention facility not being handed over , which he views as an attack on his country 's sovereignty			0
in an e-mail this month to top commanders , @entity79 gen. @entity78 , commander of @entity21 , warned of new risks of attacks due to rising tensions between @entity22 forces and the @entity6 president , an @entity21 official told @entity0			0
@entity13 's recent statements " could be a catalyst for some to lash out against our forces -- he may also issue orders that put our forces at risk , " @entity78 said			0
