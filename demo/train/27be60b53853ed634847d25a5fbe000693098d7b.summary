in 2005 , the rmb has appreciated in real terms by over 20 per cent against the @entity7 dollar			1
still , politicians and economists in the @entity7 say @entity2 is guilty of " currency manipulation " and say the rmb remains artificially undervalued			1
the @entity11 on thursday voted to push a bill which will impose punitive tariffs on @entity2 for allegedly manipulating the @entity1 exchange rate to gain unfair trade advantage			1
@entity7 president @entity16 said @entity2 is manipulating its currency but expressed concerns about backing the @entity11 bill			1
@entity2 opposes the bill , warning that it " seriously violates rules of the @entity21 and obstructs @entity2 - @entity7 trade ties			1
" @entity7 @entity23 house speaker @entity23 does not support the bill either			1
" this is well beyond what @entity25 ought to be doing , and while i 've got concerns about how the @entity28 have dealt with their currency , i 'm not sure this is the way to fix it , " he said tuesday			2
what is the currency dispute all about ? this week i talked with @entity34 , an associate professor at @entity36 's @entity35 and a former aide to @entity38 , to seek answers to my nine questions			0
1 ) how serious is the @entity7 trade deficit with @entity2 ? @entity7 trade deficit with @entity2 has steadily grown over the past decade			1
in 2010 , it reached $ 273 billion , over 40 % of @entity7 's global trade deficit , but still amounted to less than 2 % of gdp			1
in fact , @entity7 's global trade deficit peaked in 2006 and has declined substantially , largely due to expanding exports			1
the real problem is n't so much the absolute size of the @entity7 - @entity2 trade imbalance , but the struggle to find sources of growth in a stagnant global economy			1
2 ) the @entity7 will hold a presidential election next year			2
how is the trade dispute with @entity2 playing out in @entity7 ? the number one election issue is going to be jobs , so every politician wants to show that they 're doing something about jobs			1
@entity2 's trade imbalance with the @entity7 is a real issue : if @entity2 's markets were more open , if it was encouraging consumer demand instead of piling up reserves , it could help boost job growth in the @entity7 so there 's a temptation to seize on @entity2 's currency policy as a " silver bullet " that will solve this concern , by making @entity7 goods cheaper and @entity28 ones more expensive , even though the real problem is more complex than that			1
3 ) what impact will the @entity11 bill have if passed ? the immediate concern would be retaliation , provoking a trade war with @entity2			1
even if @entity2 did n't opt for actual retaliation , it could challenge the @entity7 sanctions with the @entity21 , and @entity2 might very well win			1
one of the reasons the @entity7 has always hesitated in slapping sanctions on @entity2 over currency is the fear that we might be shooting blanks			1
4 ) why so ? it 's far from clear that twisting @entity2 's arm to strengthen its currency will have the effect we might hope			1
we 've actually seen this movie before			0
in the @entity97 in 1985 , @entity96 agreed , under considerable @entity7 pressure , to strengthen its currency in order to combat the growing @entity7 trade deficit			1
the yen doubled in value , but to everyone 's surprise , it had virtually no impact on the trade balance , because there were subsidies , trade barriers , and other policies in place in @entity96 that countered the stronger yen and prevented an adjustment from taking place			0
@entity2 into a corner and force it to accept a stronger yuan , without embracing the kind of economic adjustment that really requires , and i 'm afraid we 'll see a replay of the @entity97			2
5 ) what is the fundamental reason causing the trade deficit ? the cheap yuan is one factor , but it 's only one piece of the puzzle			0
other factors include obstacles to market access , @entity2 's failure to protect intellectual property rights , export tax rebates , subsidized inputs , subsidized credit , and soft budget constraints for @entity28 state - owned companies			1
there are a whole host of factors in the @entity28 economy besides currency that distort price signals in favor of exports and discourage imports			0
to their credit , @entity7 negotiators have been placing more and more emphasis on these issues lately , rather than focusing exclusively on currency as some kind of " silver bullet			2
" 6 ) why should @entity2 revalue the renminbi ? when @entity2 intervenes to keep the yuan from rising , in order to protect export growth , it ends up accumulating trillions of dollars in official reserves that it has to somehow invest , leaving it exposed to losses			2
it also injects trillions of yuan into its domestic economy , fueling inflation and asset bubbles			0
the fact is , when you run massive trade and investment imbalances , as @entity2 is doing , you 're going to get an adjustment , one way or the other			2
it 's either going to take place through external prices ( exchange rates ) or internal prices ( inflation )			0
7 ) what will be the pros and cons for @entity2 ? there will be losers			2
some @entity28 exporters , especially those with razor - thin margins and no reliable competitive advantage , may lose their markets and go out of business			0
but there will be winners too			0
a stronger yuan would give the average @entity28 citizen greater buying power and an improved standard of living			0
8 ) some observers argue that , if the renminbi revalues and the @entity28 exports to the @entity7 become expensive , the @entity7 consumers will have to pay more for them -- and thus will be hurt too			2
your view ? that 's absolutely true			0
just as a stronger yuan will mean that @entity28 consumers will enjoy greater buying power , @entity7 consumers will lose some of the buying power they 've enjoyed over @entity28 goods			0
their dollars will buy less			0
but the focus in @entity7 right now is on jobs , not buying power			0
the problem this past decade is that @entity7 ' buying power has led us to consume more than we produce , which means more than we could ultimately afford , and as we 've all come to learn , that 's just not sustainable			0
9 ) will further revaluation of the renminbi help stop the loss of jobs in the @entity7 ? a stronger yuan is not going to bring back jobs in labor - intensive , low - tech industries where the @entity7 has no real competitive advantage			2
those jobs will go to @entity223 or @entity224 before they come back to the @entity7 but a @entity28 consumer with greater buying power -- if accompanied by greater openness and fairer treatment for @entity7 companies in the @entity28 market -- will translate into more opportunities and more jobs in sectors where the @entity7 has a real advantage			0
twisting @entity2 's tail wo n't get us there , however			0
a market - based exchange rate has to be part of a more comprehensive win - win solution .			0
