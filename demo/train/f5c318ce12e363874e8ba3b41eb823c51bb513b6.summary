-- february 26 , 2012			0
that was the day two strangers -- @entity3 , an unarmed black teenager walking back with @entity5 and an iced tea he 'd picked up at @entity7 , and @entity8 , a white @entity9 neighborhood watch volunteer in @entity10 , @entity11 -- met for the first and only time			1
it 's been nearly a year since @entity8 shot @entity3 to death			1
the incident generated huge outrage across the country for months and led to a wide - ranging conversation about the state of @entity20 race relations			1
@entity8 acknowledged shooting @entity3 but said it was in self - defense			1
attorneys for @entity3 's family have accused @entity8 of racially profiling @entity3 and shooting him " in cold blood			1
" attention to the case has died down substantially in recent months , and you may have been focused on other things			1
here are a few things you might not know about the case , which is scheduled for a june 10 trial			0
photos , evidence trickle out , seemingly helping , hurting both sides from the beginning , @entity8 insisted he was a victim : @entity3 attacked him , then they tussled , he said			1
at one point , the teenager forced @entity8 to the ground -- his head hitting the pavement -- and he cried out for help			0
it was then that @entity8 , saying he had no other choice , shot @entity3			1
@entity3 's family members say @entity8 tracked down and sought out @entity3 , ignoring a 911 dispatcher 's directive , then shot dead the unarmed teen			1
unless there 's a plea deal , the case is dismissed or there is another unexpected turn of events , the final decision of who is right and wrong will be made by jurors			0
what happened the night @entity3 died when they do , they 'll delve into mounds of evidence , key elements of which emerged well after the initial hubbub erupted			1
for example , did @entity3 handle the gun he was ultimately shot with ? no , according to test results made public last may , which showed evidence of @entity8 's hands on the firearm , but not those of the teenager he killed			1
and an analysis showed that scrapings from underneath the teenager 's fingernails did not contain any of @entity8 's dna , as may rub off in a prolonged struggle			2
yet @entity8 has said there was a bloody fight before the shooting , and he 's got the pictures to prove it			2
those include photos , reportedly taken minutes after the shooting , showing streaks of blood on the back of @entity8 's head			1
and in december , a photo posted on @entity8 's defense web site , one that his lawyers say was taken that same winter night , showed the defendant with blood on his nose and lips			1
@entity8 's legal defense fund keeps pulling in cash -- and needs it as of january 2 , the fund had raised $ 314,099 , according to a web site established by @entity8 's legal team to solicit contributions to help pay for the defense effort			1
that 's up from the $ 180,000 @entity8 raised on his own before turning the money over to his lawyer last year			1
what 's the money been used for ? the biggest single expense remains the $ 95,000 bond to secure his release from jail			0
the fund has also paid $ 61,747.54 in living expenses for @entity8 and his wife , who are now living in an undisclosed rental home , at a price his legal team describes as " reasonable , " in @entity123 , @entity11			0
other expenses include $ 56,100 for security , a little more than $ 76,000 in expenses for the law firm and the case , and $ 3,201 in miscellaneous expenses			0
those include @entity8 's gps monitoring fees , office supplies and the occasional pizza for interns on the case , who work for free , according to the web site			2
and they say they need much more money			0
claiming that @entity8 's team is already operating " on a shoestring budget , relying on individuals who have been willing to work for free or at a substantially reduced rate , " a message on the defense fund 's web site predicts the total costs of defending @entity8 will top $ 1 million			2
his two top defense attorneys , @entity150 and @entity151 , have not been paid yet , the web site states			0
" the state has virtually unlimited resources to prosecute @entity8 , " the web site reads			0
" to finance his defense , however , @entity8 relies on the generosity of individuals who believe he is innocent			2
@entity8 is not just fighting the prosecution , he 's also suing @entity158 in december , @entity8 filed a lawsuit accusing the network of taking his comments to a 911 dispatcher out of context in an effort to sensationalize the case			1
the lawsuit accuses the network of removing nearly a minute of dialogue and dead air between @entity8 and the dispatcher to bring comments that @entity3 appeared to be " up to no good " and " he looks black " closer together			1
the lawsuit also accuses @entity158 of falsely claiming @entity8 used a racial epithet in describing @entity3			1
the network , @entity8 's suit claims , used " deceptive and exploitative manipulations " to increase ratings			2
the network 's airings of the edited recordings in march 2012 contributed to death threats that forced @entity8 into hiding , the lawsuit says			2
the lawsuit alleges that such coverage led to death threats against @entity8 , who wears a bulletproof vest and was even dismissed from his college because it felt fellow students could be endangered			2
he also had to move from his neighborhood in @entity10 , leading to various unforeseen expenses			0
" due to the defendants ' journalistic crimes , @entity8 has been transformed into one of the most hated men in @entity20 , " the suit said			0
" there was no intent to portray mr. @entity8 unfairly , " the company said at the time			0
" we intend to vigorously defend our position in court			0
' @entity209 ' law does n't apply , defendant 's lawyers say the @entity11 law , passed in 2006 , says people who feel threatened do n't have to retreat from danger , no matter where they are			0
and it became a huge point of contention after @entity8 's arrest , with his supporters saying the incident demonstrated the precise need for the law and critics saying it encourages a " @entity223 " or vigilante mentality			2
but @entity8 's lawyers say it does n't apply to his case , at least not exactly			2
" in this particular case , @entity8 did not have an ability to retreat because he was on the ground with @entity3 mounting him , striking blows , therefore the @entity236 ' given by the statute simply does not apply to the facts of @entity8 's case : it is traditional self - defense , " @entity8 's attorneys said on the web site detailing his legal case			1
but they do intend to ask a judge to apply the immunity provisions of @entity11 's self - defense law to stave off a trial on the charges			1
unstable ground : the fine line between self - defense and murder the law says people who use fatal force within the guidelines set out by the law are immune from prosecution			1
a hearing on the issue could happen in april , according to the web site			0
@entity3 would have celebrated his 18th birthday this month @entity3 would have turned 18 on february 5			0
his supporters marked his birthday with a peace rally in a historically black part of @entity10 in central @entity11 , @entity0 affiliate @entity261 reported			0
it was a relatively small affair , about 70 people , compared with the thousands who turned out regularly to support @entity3 's family and demand @entity8 's prosecution in the weeks immediately after his death			1
those rallies , led oftentimes by civil rights leaders from around the country , helped catapult the case into the national limelight			0
@entity3 's parents ready to let jury decide fate of son 's killer unlike early demonstrations , where supporters issued loud and relentless calls for justice , the @entity10 birthday ceremony was more subdued			2
this time , supporters wore bracelets reading " band together , " @entity261 reported , and called for healing in the community after the shooting , which divided black and white residents and put the police department in a harsh light for not immediately arresting @entity8			0
" there 's something coming out of this , and that 's understanding			0
@entity10 will be a better community for it , " said lawyer @entity299 , who was among those representing the @entity3 family in the spring			0
two people who were front and center at those earlier rallies -- @entity3 's parents , @entity307 and @entity308 -- were not in @entity10 that day			2
instead , they quietly and privately marked their late son 's birthday in @entity311 , @entity261 said .			0
