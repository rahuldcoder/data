-- as @entity2 washed over the southern @entity4 island of @entity5 last december , heavy rains triggered deadly floods and landslides			1
more than 1,000 people died and at least 1,500 were injured , according to the @entity9			1
the storm , locally called @entity2 , left tens of thousands homeless			1
' @entity11 ' after @entity4 storm when @entity15 @entity14 from @entity16 , a @entity17 suburb , saw the destruction spread across the southern part of his country , he knew he had to act			1
he and a group of seven friends planned a trip to @entity5 for the first week of february so they could help in the effort to rebuild			1
they named it " @entity27			1
" @entity28 : operation valentines under way shortly after the group arrived in @entity33 , @entity31 shared his thoughts and hopes for the trip with @entity0 by e-mail in this @entity39			1
@entity0 : tell me about your trip			2
how did it start ? @entity31 : a handful of @entity15 friends of mine , along with myself , wanted to do something for the victims of @entity2 other than just writing or talking about it			1
we felt the need to at least do something to show the people that there are those who do care about their situation			2
we started to plan a quick trip to [ @entity33 ] a day before the new year			1
but it was not enough			0
we needed to do something more			0
thus , a second trip was planned , this time over a month after the typhoon			2
that is because we figured that by that time ( this february ) , the attention of the general public would have shifted elsewhere			0
the victims would have been just statistical data and forgotten			2
what better thing to do on the love month of february , than to do something that will show these people the love and concern we do have for them			2
to give them the " @entity74 " they did n't get			0
to bring to them some joy and happiness			1
@entity0 : what are you doing ? @entity31 : we each tried to gather things , relief goods from friends and relatives , even our own personal belongings that we felt would be useful			1
we coordinated with people in the area -- @entity33 and @entity89 -- who would accompany us in our relief efforts			1
personally , i gathered the elementary school books of my kids from grade one to six for all subjects which the people in @entity89 can use to start a small library			1
i do have almost half a ton of clothes ready just in case the people would need clothes			2
we hope to go back to the area and see what else we can do for the people we 've met if possible , to help them rebuild a schoolroom at least , and help them with their water supply as they have only one source of water for the entire barangay ( or district )			2
@entity0 : why is this project important ? @entity31 : for all the hazards and disasters that occur , be it natural or man - made , the children are the ones that suffer the most			1
they are the most vulnerable			0
though not related to us in any way , even as total strangers , our hearts lead us to do something , anything , that can help lighten the load of these people			0
we may not be able to help everyone , but those that we can help by whatever means possible , then it is something worth doing			0
@entity0 : how are you making an impact ? @entity31 : by creating awareness			2
by giving a way by which people , ordinary people , can help others through our joint efforts			0
by planning what we want to accomplish , and following through on our promise			0
by starting to help -- one life , one community , one step at a time			0
@entity0 : why should other people get involved ? @entity31 : life has got to be more than just working and having a good time			1
we have to stand for something			0
there is a time when we should just stop criticizing , stop staying on the sideline , stop being a spectator			0
it is about time that people get involved in what 's happening around them			0
rather than being a part of the problem , let us be key to the solution			0
what are you doing to @entity169 ? we want to hear about how you or someone you know is making a difference in the lives of others			0
go to @entity28 for details .			0
