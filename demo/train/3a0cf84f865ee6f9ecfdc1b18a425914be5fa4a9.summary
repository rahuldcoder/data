-- rescuers in @entity2 worked furiously tuesday to free people trapped under rubble , a day after a powerful earthquake rippled through a rural stretch of villages in the country 's southeastern region , @entity2 media reported			1
@entity2 's @entity11 said aftershocks followed the 6.5 magnitude monday quake that struck at least 70 villages in @entity16			1
@entity2 authorities recorded seven deaths and dozens of injuries so far , but authorities expect the casualty toll to rise in the quake -- just over 60 miles away from the site of a deadly tremor that killed 30,000 people seven years ago in the city of @entity27			1
@entity2 's @entity28 reported that scores of people are trapped in the debris of buildings that have been destroyed			1
many such sites are in hard - to - reach locations , making any rescue operations even more difficult			2
are you there ? share earthquake stories with @entity39 @entity40 , a @entity41 physicist in @entity42 , @entity43 , thinks the number of deaths could range from between 10 to 1,000 , based on statistics and information about past earthquakes			0
she said that while this latest event was similar in magnitude to the @entity27 quake , which measured at 6.6 magnitude , the monday quake struck a more remote region about 63 miles away from that city			2
" that 's an important thing to realize			0
that distance will help decrease the fatality rate as well as the damage , " she said			0
" there is n't a big city anywhere to be seen			0
" but , she said , that does n't mean the quake was n't felt through the region			1
in fact , said @entity16 governor @entity67 , the tremors were felt as far away as @entity69 , which lies on the @entity70 , and @entity71 , which borders @entity72 and @entity73			2
it was also felt in @entity27 and other cities , such as @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
" considering the dimensions of the damage , the death toll is expected to rise , " @entity67 was quoted as saying by the @entity28 news agency			1
the high - impact zone 's population -- which @entity67 estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 people -- was widely dispersed			2
the quake 's epicenter was around the town of @entity89			2
many of the structures in the quake - hit region use adobe as construction material , and that can crumble in earthquakes , @entity11 reported			1
photos in @entity2 media showed pictures of rubble and people huddled outside damaged buildings			1
images showed some bodies wrapped in sheets and people crying			0
@entity105 , a deputy governor for @entity16 , told the @entity28 that the tremor knocked down phone lines throughout the region			0
military and law enforcement workers could communicate only using wireless technology , he added			0
relief and recovery teams , some from outside the area , have converged around the village of @entity89 , between the towns of @entity118 and @entity119 , @entity105 said			0
in addition , @entity28 reported that @entity16 's disaster council convened an emergency meeting to assess possible damage and coordinate potential aid and assistance efforts			0
@entity2 lies on a series of seismic fault lines and experiences earthquakes almost daily , and at times , they have had devastating consequences , such as the quake in @entity27			1
last year , an earthquake struck @entity69 in southern @entity2 , injuring about 700 people in the port city of @entity137 , state media reported			1
and there 's been plenty of activity in recent months as well			0
in early november , a 4.9 - magnitude earthquake in the northwestern @entity142 injured at least 80 people , according to @entity28			0
one person died two months earlier when a quake measuring magnitude - 5.5 struck southern @entity2 , and in august three were killed after a 5.7 - magnitude tremor in northern @entity2 , several state news agencies reported			1
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed to this report			0
