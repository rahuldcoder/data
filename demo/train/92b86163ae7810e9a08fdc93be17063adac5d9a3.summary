among the targets of @entity2 strikes across @entity3 early tuesday was the @entity4 -- a collection of senior @entity7 members who have moved into @entity3			1
president @entity8 called them " seasoned @entity7 operatives			0
" " once again , it must be clear to anyone who would plot against @entity2 and try to do @entity2 harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people , " @entity8 said			1
the strikes targeted " training camps , an explosives and munitions production facility , a communication building and command and control facilities , " the military said in a statement			0
the group was actively plotting against a @entity2 homeland target and @entity32 targets , a senior @entity2 official told @entity33 on tuesday			1
the @entity2 hoped to surprise the group by mixing strikes against it with strikes against @entity38 targets			1
the official said the group posed an " imminent " threat			1
another @entity2 official later said the threat was not imminent in the sense that there were no known targets or attacks expected in the next few weeks			1
the plots were believed to be in an advanced stage , the second @entity2 official said			1
there were indications that the militants had obtained materials and were working on new improvised explosive devices that would be hard to detect , including common hand - held electronic devices and airplane carry - on items such as toiletries			0
the intelligence community discovered @entity59 plots against the @entity2 within the past week , an intelligence source with knowledge of the matter told @entity33			1
the intelligence source did not give an intended target but said the plots potentially involved a bomb made of a nonmetallic device like a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material			0
a plot involving concealed bombs on airplanes " was just one option they were looking at " a @entity2 official briefed on the matter told @entity33 's @entity73			1
social media video posted tuesday purported to show the aftermath of strikes in the small town of @entity81 , some 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) west of @entity82 , in an area controlled by @entity84 , the @entity7 affiliate in @entity3			0
' yet another threat to the homeland ' @entity59 's existence was publicly acknowledged only last week , when @entity2 director of national intelligence @entity88 said it was operating in @entity90 and @entity3 , with a focus on exporting terror to the @entity93			1
" there is potentially yet another threat to the homeland , yes , " he told an intelligence conference in @entity95			0
@entity100 's statement spoke of " action to disrupt the imminent attack plotting against the @entity2 and @entity32 interests " by @entity7 veterans in @entity59 , who had " established a safe haven in @entity3 to develop external attacks , construct and test improvised explosive devices and recruit @entity32 to conduct operations			1
" one of those veterans is believed to be @entity110 , a short and slight @entity111 who is 33 years old			1
a security source in the @entity114 tells @entity33 that @entity110 arrived in @entity3 in april 2013 and began working with @entity84			2
nine months later , @entity88 sounded the first warning about @entity84 's goals beyond @entity3 , saying it " does have aspirations for attacks on the homeland			0
" at some point , @entity110 appears to have parted company with @entity84 -- perhaps , according to the source , because it saw him as in league with @entity125 , where he had been based as @entity7 's senior representative			2
the source says @entity110 's new focus on " external operations " was revealed by one of his bodyguards , named as @entity133 , who was recently arrested by the regime of @entity3 president @entity135			2
train abroad , take the terror back home the source says @entity110 is trying to emulate the success of @entity38 in using social media to recruit @entity32 -- people who could be trained and then sent home to launch terror attacks			1
to this end , @entity110 has been able to recruit a member of @entity38 ' media team to help with recruitment for @entity59			1
another key figure in @entity59 appears to be a @entity150 national : @entity151			2
soon after @entity110 arrived in @entity3 , so did @entity151 -- " accompanied by several individuals to participate in the fighting there , " according to a @entity2 @entity156 designation			1
he was described as " part of a group of senior @entity7 members in @entity3 formed to conduct external operations against @entity32 targets			0
" @entity162 is also experienced at moving funds and had a senior position in @entity7 in @entity165 , running its communications courier network			0
according to his @entity2 designation , @entity151 later became @entity7 's chief of security responsible for counterintelligence			2
now on @entity150 's list of its 47 most wanted terror suspects , @entity172 's skill set would be well - suited to @entity59 's purported goals			2
@entity2 intelligence officials are concerned that the @entity59 cell may include operatives who have learned from @entity179 , the master bombmaker of @entity180 , who has twice come close to bringing down @entity32 airliners with ingeniously devised bombs			1
counterterrorism sources have frequently told @entity33 in recent years of their fears that @entity179 has passed on his skills to apprentice bombmakers			0
troubling ties on the @entity188 @entity2 rep. @entity189 of @entity190 , chairman of the @entity191 , has also described @entity59 as " forward - deployed @entity7 operatives who were engaging with @entity180 to develop a terror plot to bring down airplanes			1
" @entity180 is based in @entity195 , where @entity110 has had contacts in the past			2
when he was scarcely 20 , according to @entity2 officials , he was involved in financing a suicide attack in october 2002 against on an oil tanker , the @entity201 , in the @entity202 , an attack carried out by @entity195 from the city of @entity205			2
he also plotted an attack on a hotel in the @entity195 capital , @entity209 , where @entity2 officials were known to stay			2
before that , he had fought as a teenager with the @entity213 and @entity7 in @entity214 and was also " reported to have been among the few trusted @entity7 operatives who received advance notification " of the 9/11 attacks , according to his designation by the @entity156			0
@entity220 was designated as a terrorist by the @entity2 in 2005 as " a major facilitator " for @entity7 and @entity223 , then terrorizing @entity90			2
he had access to plenty of money from private donors in @entity111			0
according to court testimony , he had been involved in a group called the @entity230 in @entity111 and had experimented with explosives while planning an attack on @entity2 troops at the @entity234 in @entity111			1
wanted in @entity150 and convicted in absentia in @entity111 , he vanished for a while before resurfacing in @entity125 as @entity7 's most senior representative there			0
in 2012 , the @entity238 said @entity110 was moving fighters and money through @entity241 to @entity3 , leveraging his extensive network of @entity111 jihadist donors			1
he also gained what may prove to be invaluable experience " moving multiple operatives from @entity165 via @entity125 and @entity241 to destinations in @entity248 , @entity249 , and @entity3 , " the @entity238 said			0
just why he left @entity125 last year is unclear , but about the same time , other @entity7 figures , including @entity252 's son - in - law , @entity251 , also began leaving @entity125 -- perhaps not entirely willingly			0
a good way for @entity7 to counter @entity38 for @entity7 , locked in a battle with @entity38 for the crown of leading global jihad , the creation of @entity59 makes perfect sense			1
just last week , a spokesman for @entity7 confronted the group 's critics in an audio message			0
" so how then can @entity7 have shrunken greatly and lost many of its senior leaders at a time when it is expanding horizontally and opening new fronts dependent on it ? " asked spokesman @entity263			0
he also quoted a @entity2 terror analyst , @entity269 : " @entity7 affiliates have evolved and now threaten the @entity2 as much as ( if not more than ) the core group ; they can no longer be dismissed as mere local @entity7 franchises			0
" now -- with extensive contacts throughout the region and experience in raising funds and moving people -- @entity110 and @entity151 have embarked on the next phase of their careers in terrorism , one that may be the most dangerous to the @entity93			0
the @entity100 's use of the phrase " imminent attack planning " may explain why the group was a first wave target			0
the @entity114 security source told @entity33 sunday that @entity110 was believed to be operating near the town of @entity290 in @entity292 province -- which would have put him in the general area of the airstrikes			2
still unknown : whether @entity110 and @entity151 survived to continue that planning .			0

official : @entity59 plot involving concealed bombs on airplanes " was just one option "
the threat from the @entity4 was not imminent , a @entity2 official says
one feared operative is @entity307 , a @entity111 with a disturbing resume
a source says @entity110 and @entity59 are taking cues from the recruiting success of @entity38
