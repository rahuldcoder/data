-- the @entity1 crossing the @entity3 border in massive waves have been described as immigrants or refugees			1
the distinction is significant and could determine whether the migrants are subject to deportation to their home country or eligible to remain in the @entity3 under asylum			1
what is an immigrant ? an immigrant is someone who chooses to resettle to another country			1
the @entity3 has a legal process for that immigrant to seek legal residency and eventually citizenship			1
many immigrants , however , do n't have such legal status and are thus undocumented			0
as such , they are subject to " removal " or deportation from the @entity3			1
there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the @entity3 -- a problem that has led @entity27 and @entity28 alike to declare the @entity3 immigration system as " broken			2
" @entity30 has been deadlocked for years on how to reform immigration laws			0
" migrants , especially economic migrants , choose to move in order to improve the future prospects of themselves and their families , " the @entity32 high commissioner for refugees says			0
" refugees have to move if they are to save their lives or preserve their freedom			0
" what is a refugee ? a refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her home country			1
as such , refugees can apply for asylum in the @entity3 , a process that could take years			1
getting refugee status is n't easy			1
the applicants have to prove that if they return to their home country , they 'll be injured because of their race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group or their political opinion			1
" refugees are generally people outside of their country who are unable or unwilling to return home because they fear serious harm , " the @entity58 says			2
the @entity1 overwhelming the @entity3 - @entity64 border are @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			2
many are fleeing drug - and gang - fueled violence back home			0
is the violence -- any kind -- grounds for a refugee claim ? not necessarily			0
the violence has to be targeted to a person specifically , and that 's where things get complicated			0
every case is different , and because of a law signed by president @entity84 in 2008 , children fall into a special class			0
the @entity86 , named after a 19th century @entity88 abolitionist , is designed to crack down on the global child slave trade			0
the @entity3 law ensured that children who came to the country got a full immigration hearing instead of being turned away or sent back			1
the hearing would determine whether the children had a valid claim for asylum			2
the law is now cited as one cause behind a projected 90,000 children from @entity1 and @entity64 who will cross the @entity3 border alone or with other children this year , a huge increase over the 39,000 that the @entity104 detained last year			0
asylum is a protection available to people who are already in the @entity3 or are seeking admission at the @entity3 border			2
@entity0 's @entity109 contributed to this report .			0

the distinction can determine deportation from @entity3 or the chance to stay under asylum
an immigrant chooses to resettle to another country
a refugee is forced to flee his or her home country
getting asylum in the @entity3 is n't easy and could take years
