@entity0 -- about this time last year , @entity2 was surrounded by 15 of her closest relatives , heaping turkey , stuffing and two kinds of potatoes onto her plate			1
football was on television , beers were in the fridge and the family was together			2
" that 's how it should be , " she said , stirring the cranberry sauce for this year 's @entity17 dinner			2
her tight - knit @entity22 - @entity21 family lives on @entity0 's @entity23 in the @entity25 neighborhood of @entity26 , where a powerful mix of converging weather systems flattened homes on october 29			1
when the storm hit , a series of tidal surges crashed through the neighborhood as high winds whipped along the coast , leaving billions of dollars in damage and thousands homeless			0
volunteers help @entity39 victims start over " we normally do n't evacuate , but did this time , " @entity2 said			1
she fled with her family to her sister - in - law 's place in @entity44 one day before @entity39 made landfall			2
but her neighbor , @entity46 , decided to stay and brave the torrents unleashed on this coastal community and others like it along the @entity51			0
after each storm surge , she uploaded photos of the aftermath to @entity55 , keeping @entity57 abreast of the condition of her home			2
as the hours progressed and the photos streamed in , tension mounted			0
by late evening on october 29 , it became clear that @entity39 had rendered the @entity2 family homeless			1
" my knees buckled , and i fell , " said @entity2 , who is 52 and an attorney			1
" i inherited that house from mom and dad			0
and we had spent the year renovating			0
" the " @entity78 family compound , " as she called it ( referencing her maiden name ) , had been in the family for generations , serving as a gathering spot for neighborhood get - togethers and holiday festivities			1
built in 1937 , it was where her parents hosted beach parties and entertained neighbors with beer , wine and music that would often carry along a beachfront that residents lovingly coined the " @entity90			1
" during the holidays , throngs of @entity57 's nieces and nephews squeezed onto mismatched chairs set around a cherry oak dining - room table that she inherited from her grandmother			0
filling their stomachs with stuffed sausage and mushrooms , bread with raspberry and walnuts and sweet potato pie with marshmallows , they would then retire to the family - room couch or their own homes just a few doors down the block			2
" it 's the kind of thing that 's lost in @entity21 today			0
having that fabric of the family in the same neighborhood , " she said			2
now , many of those cherished physical spaces in the @entity23 are gone in @entity39 's wake			2
the first floor of @entity2 's two - story home collapsed , and its two decks all but disappeared into the sand			1
@entity2 's husband , @entity127 , uncovered the frayed wooden leg of that dining - room table -- one of many family heirlooms lost in the storm -- down the block , sticking out from a pile of trash			1
still , @entity2 seemed determined to celebrate this year 's holidays in the same fashion to which she was accustomed : surrounded by her family			1
@entity140 community gives thanks even after @entity39 " for us , it 's like the house died , but we did n't , " she said			0
@entity39 caused 119 deaths in the @entity21 , including 43 in @entity0 and 33 in @entity44			0
the @entity145 and their neighbors managed to escape with their lives			0
yet three weeks after the storm , they say they still have not received any form of compensation			0
" on top of all of this sadness , we are struggling with the insurance companies , " said @entity2 , whose family is now holed up in a rental home in southern @entity44			1
@entity158 , they say they plan to pile into the car thursday and head north , joining 13 other relatives for @entity17 dinner in @entity25 at her sister 's storm - battered , though still functional , home			2
" my sister was out buying air mattresses , " she said			0
" it 's going to be a little tight , sleeping like the @entity22 did after @entity168 : 12 to a room ! " but with a daughter who is " borderline asthmatic , " the @entity145 say they plan to stay only one night			0
what local residents call " the @entity23 dust " has them concerned			1
rotting drywall , mold and piles of garbage across the @entity23 have residents worried about worsening air quality in the region , though officials were not immediately available to comment on the relatively new phenomenon			1
a red sticker on the @entity145 ' old front door signifies that the city has condemned the building and plans to demolish it			0
the remains of their home will now likely join the massive garbage heaps along the @entity23 shore , adding to potential health concerns			1
@entity194 : who 's at your @entity17 table ? @entity1 's @entity198 contributed to this report			0

the @entity2 family was one of many to lose their home on the @entity23
the home , built in 1937 , was in the family for five generations of parties and holiday celebrations
residents now worry about " @entity23 dust , " rotting drywall , mold and garbage
