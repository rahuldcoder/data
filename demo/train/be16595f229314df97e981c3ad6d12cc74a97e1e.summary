-- remaking a landmark film ought to be a perfectly respectable proposition			1
after all , we see new versions of @entity5 or @entity6 all the time ( whether on stage or screen )			2
what 's wrong with doing an updated version of a beloved @entity13 movie ? in theory , nothing , yet in practice , it seldom works out well			2
there 's something about how movies , with their singularity of mood and density of detail , imprint themselves on our imaginations that places the prospect of a remake somewhere between a rock and a hard place			1
think about it : if you follow the original too closely , duplicating signature shots or lines of dialogue or acting flourishes , then you 're stuck in a mode of mindless imitation — and what 's the point of that ? people might as well just watch the great version they already know ( or , for new generations , have yet to discover )			2
but if you seriously update the movie in question , making a lot of eyebrow - raising changes , then you risk violating the essence of the original — or leaving out too much of what everyone loved about it in the first place			1
when you get down to it , a '' new '' version of a classic is a contradiction in terms			2
@entity62 , the rapturous and terrifying 1976 @entity64 thriller based on @entity66 's first novel , is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without , perhaps , ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece			0
yet i personally think it 's a great film			1
there 's nothing that compares to its glittery fusion of dreaminess and dread — of @entity81 - at - the - prom fantasy and blood - bucket horror , all mixed up with elements of ' 70s teensploitation comedy and primally entangled mother - daughter tragedy			1
and what acting ! @entity92 , as the squashed - nerd telekinetic high school wallflower @entity62 , and @entity89 , as her ragingly repressed @entity87 mom , achieved a tremulous power together			1
and @entity64 , a prankish virtuoso , perched the whole thing on the knife 's edge between sincerity and satire			0
@entity62 is a timeless movie because it 's both one of the most passionate and most scandalously funny horror films ever made			0
so what does one do for a remake encore ? @entity105 , the gifted director of the new @entity62 , has gone down what seems , on the surface , to be a savvy road			1
she follows @entity64 's version quite faithfully , evoking everything from his camera angles to his lighting to his flying - object @entity113 to his gleeful staging of mean - girl antics			1
at the same time , she offers just enough tweaks and updated details to present the material in a new way			0
the fabled shower - room scene , in which the naïve , sheltered @entity122 ( @entity123 ) gets her first period and is shocked into thinking that she 's dying , now has an added fillip of cruelty : @entity128 , the most hateful of the girls , does n't just pelt @entity62 with tampons and shout '' plug it up ! '' she records the whole ordeal on her smartphone and then posts the video			1
in a neat reversal , @entity128 and her best friend , the popular but far more empathetic @entity136 ( who feels so guilty about what happened that she gets her boyfriend to take @entity62 to the prom ) , are both portrayed against type : nice - girl @entity136 is played by @entity144 , who looks like a vintage snooty princess , whereas the awful @entity128 is made into a pensive bohemian punk by @entity147			1
and @entity62 's mother ( @entity148 ) , a fundamentalist fanatic who tries to cut @entity62 off from the world , is now herself a cutter who pinpricks her own flesh in secret			0
@entity148 makes her fierce , guilt - tripping , and scary — but not , in the way that @entity89 did , almost religiously possessed			1
despite being 40 years old now , the @entity62 story lives quite comfortably in the 21st century			0
here 's the problem , though			0
the original film had @entity66 's ingenious plot , with its fusion of innocence and cruelty and that subliminal wink of demonic takeover , but it also had @entity64 's voluptuous operatic style , which gave the story the quality of a daydream - turned - nightmare			1
when you take away that style and serve up the plot fairly straight , as @entity105 does here , we seem to be watching a @entity62 that 's been flattened , robbed of its over-the - top emotional extravagance			1
given the challenge of revamping @entity92 's brilliant shivery - nerd - turned - avenger performance , @entity123 does a creditable job			1
in stiff hair and lumpish clothing , she 's very much the geek outsider ( though today there 's a much greater context for geeks as heroines ) , and the emotions seem to bleed through her ghostly , lunar - pale skin			2
yet the way @entity105 has updated @entity122 , without making any overt changes to the character , is to portray her as a little less clueless , a little less pathetic , a little more defiant			0
she 's now a cute , bright , painfully shy girl who sees herself ( wrongly ) as a loser			0
before , she was a total walking blob of misery and dysfunction			0
that slight tonal shift robs the story of its masochistic edge			0
of course , @entity62 is n't merely a fable of adolescent agony			0
it 's all about @entity62 's revenge , once she 's subjected to the most diabolical practical '' joke '' in movie history			0
@entity62 's telekinetic powers , driven by the rage she represses , allowed @entity64 to orchestrate a senior - prom apocalypse that was pure filmmaking mastery			2
@entity105 stages the prom as a prosaic rerun , without a lot of gaudy inspiration			0
and it 's here that the real problem with redoing a classic reveals itself			0
sure , a lot of famous movies are timeless , yet they 're also rooted in their time			0
in the original @entity62 , @entity92 's character seemed to be channeling something creepy and larger - than - life — maybe it was even the underworld			2
but now we 're a lot more accustomed to seeing movie characters mold their destiny through special effects , and since @entity236 films the climax in a rather depersonalized , shoot - the - works way , @entity62 comes close to seeming like an especially alienated member of the x-men team			2
she blows stuff up real good , in a way that would make the devil — or @entity240 — proud			0
