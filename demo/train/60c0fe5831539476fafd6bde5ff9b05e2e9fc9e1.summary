@entity0 , @entity1 -- the comeback story of the one - eyed pitcher is the buzz of baseball dugouts in the @entity7 , passed down the bench like a bag of sunflower seeds			1
no one would have called @entity12 a quitter if he had never walked onto a pitcher 's mound again			1
but two years after a line drive smashed his cheekbone and destroyed his left eye , @entity12 is back up on the hill , starting games			1
@entity12 , who now pitches with tinted safety glasses covering his acrylic left eye , is undefeated this season , 4 - 0 , for @entity25			1
" to me , it does n't seem like a big deal			0
i guess i am kind of a modest guy , " @entity12 , a senior , told @entity2			1
" i just hope this is a teaching tool			0
maybe if someone else is having a tough time -- not necessarily losing an eye -- and my story can inspire somebody else and motivate them , guess it 's all worth it in the end			1
" two years ago , when @entity12 played for @entity40 in @entity41 , one of his pitches was launched back at his head by the batter			1
@entity46 catches for @entity12 at @entity25 now and was behind the plate to see and hear a baseball obliterate an eye - socket , but not a young man 's will			1
" i heard this smack when it hit his face , " @entity46 recalls			0
" my first thought was : ' oh my @entity55 ! is he alive ? ' he was not moving			0
we did not know if he was conscious			0
it 's one of the scariest things i have seen in my life , and i am still jumpy when i see a ball hit back through the box			0
" @entity12 says doctors told him if the ball had struck a few inches away , on his temple , he might have died			1
" it took about a month or six weeks after that ( accident ) for me to realize i still wanted to play , " @entity12 said			2
" i told myself i at least want to try to make this work			0
" @entity12 said he started from scratch , adapting in practice to pitching with one eye			1
the 22 - year - old explains he needed to focus more on certain spots around home plate to make up for the change in depth perception			0
@entity12 is left handed , so his remaining good right eye has a wide open view of the plate			1
the baseball experts say he would not be pitching if the line drive had crushed that closer - to - home - plate right eye			1
" i was n't afraid of signing him , " said @entity83 , his current coach at @entity25			1
" i knew nothing was wrong with his arm			0
and after i met him i was 100 percent in			0
" he was looking for an opportunity and was serious about it			0
he was sort of dealt a bad hand			0
but he said he would give it his best shot			0
so he was my kind of guy			0
" @entity12 's journey back almost got derailed by an obscure @entity98 rule concerning all athletes missing one of a pair of organs , such as a kidney			2
those players must get waivers and signed paperwork confirming they are aware of the risk of accidentally losing the remaining organ			0
@entity12 , his parents , doctors and others have signed that they are aware an accident to his right eye would leave him blind			1
" he hung in there , " @entity83 told @entity2 , admiring the way @entity83 also took on the regulatory obstacles to his return			2
some 10 separate signatures and a batter 's box full of @entity98 paperwork later , @entity12 got cleared and began fooling hitters again last spring			2
@entity46 , the catcher , describes @entity12 's assortment of pitches as moving fastball , a sharp - breaking slider , a great curve ball and a change up " looking just like his fastball until it dives down at the last second			1
" @entity12 's fastball is timed out at 84 or 85 miles per hour			2
@entity12 says he 's not heard a lot from any teams about being picked in the major league draft in june , but adds there is always a chance			2
" i 'd really like to work in public relations , " @entity12 , a marketing major , said			2
" maybe i could do this for a team or sports organization , something in that area			0
" but graduation is still a few weeks off and until then , @entity12 still has the final weekend of this season and the possibility of the @entity98 playoffs			2
for every batter who will face @entity12 , there 's dealing with those four pitches and a competitive edge built up from losing an eye and regaining his swagger on the mound .			1
