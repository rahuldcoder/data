-- in the four weeks since his daughter cut her leg in the @entity4 , @entity1 has experienced several low points			1
but nothing was as desperate as a moment in the surgical waiting room on may 4			2
a doctor called from the operating room at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , where his daughter was having surgery			1
" when your daughter arrived , i was trying to save her leg , " the doctor said			1
" now i 'm trying to save her life			2
' " @entity1 felt his legs turn to rubber			2
a hospital volunteer put a chair beneath him that caught him from falling			2
his wife , @entity26 , came into the room , and @entity1 repeated what the surgeon had told him			2
" we cried and cried in each other 's arms , " @entity1 recalled			1
" we sobbed uncontrollably for 10 minutes			2
then the chaplain came in and i grabbed his hand and i said , ' let 's pray			1
' " the prayer gave them great comfort , but the couple believes prayer has done even more			1
they believe faith in @entity44 has healed their daughter , and they cite her medical progress as proof			1
' @entity50 ' milestone arrives for @entity13 woman fighting flesh - eating bacteria on may 1 , @entity53 cut her left calf when the zip line she was holding snapped near the @entity56			1
the cut allowed a flesh - eating bacteria to infect her blood stream			2
days later , doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh - devouring bacteria @entity65			2
@entity50 was in multiple organ failure			1
a respirator had to breathe for her			2
her kidneys did n't work and she was on full - time dialysis			2
her heart barely beat -- her ejection fraction , a measure of the heart 's ability to pump blood , was 10 % , when the normal rate is 55 - 75 %			1
on may 8 , a cardiopulmonologist told her parents that @entity50 's chances of survival were " slim to none			1
" the next day , they were told @entity50 might not survive the night			1
now , @entity50 's lungs breathe on their own			1
her heart is " strong and normal , " according to her father			2
while she 's still on dialysis , she 's strong enough to sit up for hours at a time			1
once unconscious , she can now mouth words and even make jokes			2
sunday , she spoke again for the first time , @entity1 wrote			0
surviving flesh - eating bacteria " the words i hear from the medical professionals to describe @entity50 's continued recovery are ' astonishing , incredible , confounding , mind boggling , and unbelievable , ' " @entity1 wrote on @entity50 's @entity91 page on may 12			1
" my favorite word is miracle			0
" ' @entity44 has worked miracles ' many studies have shown that people who have spiritual or religious lives are healthier than people who do not			0
for example , a @entity104 study published last year in the journal @entity107 , examined 28 other studies , found that religious and spiritual people had an 18 % lower mortality rate , which represented an 18 % reduction in mortality over the course of the study			0
" the results suggest that spirituality and religiosity play a considerable role in mortality rate reductions , comparable to fruit and vegetable consumption and statin therapy , " the authors wrote			0
not all studies have shown such dramatic results , and spirituality is not a guarantee of good health			0
" there are plenty of religious people who die young and plenty of atheists who live to 103 , " said dr. @entity128 , director of research at the @entity130 of @entity131 at @entity132			0
for some people of faith , the explanation for these findings is simple : @entity44 is healing the sick			0
" @entity44 has worked miracles in @entity50 's life , " her father said			1
but experts who study faith and healing have different explanations for better health outcomes among the religious			0
for example , churchgoers might be healthier because they have the social support of their fellow congregants , who can help them when they 're sick			0
another theory has to do with stress reduction			0
increased levels of stress hormones , such as cortisol , hurt the body 's immune system			1
" if somebody is anxious and upset and stressed , they 're just not going to heal as quickly , " said dr. @entity165 , director of the @entity166 at @entity167			0
' i am joyous ' reporters who 've interviewed @entity1 have remarked on how upbeat he sounds , considering that his daughter is in critical condition and doctors predict she wo n't be out of the intensive care unit for another three or four weeks			1
" her life is still on the line , " @entity1 said			0
" but i am joyous			0
" that 's different , he said , than being happy			1
he 's not happy about what his daughter has had to endure -- organ failure , an amputation of her left leg , right foot and both her hands -- but he said @entity44 's love has filled him with joy and inner peace			1
" i just feel confident she 's going to be fine			1
i ca n't really explain it			0
maybe there 's something wrong with me			1
maybe i need a psychologist to examine me , " he said			0
" but i do n't think so			0
" @entity1 , a financial adviser with @entity193 who attends the @entity194 in @entity195 , @entity13 , said part of his faith means being positive and not dwelling on the past			0
he does not wonder what might have been if @entity50 had n't gone on that zip line on the @entity4 and cut her leg , allowing bacteria in the water to infect her bloodstream			1
" driving down the road looking through your rear view mirror is going to get you killed , " he said			0
" you have to be calm and collected and live in the moment			0
" that kind of attitude -- with or without faith in a higher power -- will go a long way toward healing , experts say			0
" stewing and ruminating on doubts can consume what resources one does have on unproductive things , " said @entity216 , an associate adjunct professor at the @entity217 at the @entity218 , and an expert on health and spirituality			0
' do not be anxious about anything ' when things get tough -- such as this past wednesday when @entity50 was weakened from surgery -- @entity1 sits in her hospital room , reading @entity230 verses online on his cell phone or laptop			1
" i really need a pocket @entity230 , " he laughed			0
he has his go - to verses , such as @entity235 : " do not be anxious about anything , but in every situation , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , present your requests to @entity44			1
" one of @entity50 's favorite @entity230 verses is from 1 @entity244			1
" love is patient , love is kind , " it reads			0
" it always protects , always trusts , always hopes , always perseveres			0
" the @entity251 hope @entity50 's strength inspires others			1
before her accident , she hoped to get a masters degree in psychology and do wilderness therapy to help people with physical and mental problems			0
" as a wilderness therapist she could impact maybe a thousand people , " her father said			0
" now she can help millions			0
" @entity0 's @entity264 contributed to this report .			2

parents of @entity53 have coped with uncertainties of daughter 's illness
they believe prayer has had benefits in @entity50 's recovery
@entity277 said the most *important* thing is to look forward , rather than back
