@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was out on a mission here in his hometown to re-boot his languishing economy after political moves involving @entity9 scared off investors in the past half year			1
while voters were readying for an election this weekend in @entity9 , the @entity1 president spent 48 hours at the @entity14 to convey a message to those in attendance , his domestic constituency and investors watching our coverage from abroad			1
the images showed an engaged leader in constant dialogue with corporate titans and one helping to support dealmaking			1
@entity3 stood proudly behind @entity27 , the ceo of his energy giant @entity28 , as he finalized a recent agreement with his counterpart @entity30 of @entity32 tire manufacturer @entity31			2
the signing of seven agreements on saturday capped off a week where @entity3 orchestrated a $ 400bn , 30 - year agreement with @entity37 to export natural gas			1
to underscore that moment , he invited a @entity37 vice-premier to his annual roundtable			0
bringing him here reinforced the new partnership and illustrates to the world @entity1 is moving east to @entity43 to capture business			1
@entity45 , @entity1 economic development minister and a member of " @entity48 " told a @entity2 emerging markets roundtable here at @entity14			1
" this is our message : nothing personal , nothing political , just business			2
" impact of @entity56 but politics and business have clashed over @entity9			1
president @entity3 's move to annex @entity56 may have boosted his poll ratings at home , but it certainly has not helped his standing in global business			1
@entity65 and @entity66 sanctions prompted capital flight of $ 60bn in the first quarter			0
more worrying , cabinet ministers and business leaders told me , it 's holding back decision making			2
" this problem is not the sanctions themselves which are in place at the moment , " said @entity73 , ceo of the @entity1 natural gas and petro - chemical group @entity77 , " but rather that most of our partners do n't know what to expect if anything			1
" that uncertainty is hitting an economy already in decline			0
@entity1 was growing 4 % back in 2010 , but it has taken a staircase lower to just over 1 % last year			2
it is projected to barely expand this year , according to the @entity91			0
there is also the potential danger of global contagion by trying to isolate a near $ 2 trillion economy like @entity1			2
" it 's very difficult to solve the problem without engagement , " said @entity96 , chairman of the @entity97 at private equity firm @entity98			0
" i do n't think we 'll find solution without engagement			0
and i would apply it to both : commercial and political decisions , " he added			0
after the final event of the forum , @entity27 of @entity28 told me constant questions on sanctions do n't help matters			0
he has been the target of @entity65 sanctions limiting his ability to travel there for business with partners such as @entity120			0
" i suggest we do n't discuss the sanctions anymore because it is counterproductive , " he said , adding , " the increased attention to sanctions and discussion of sanctions significantly increase their importance			0
" corporate leaders understand that @entity3 and his team want to turn the page on @entity9 , but there is another reality			2
beyond all the efforts to convey a message of " business as usual , " investors who attended the forum said they want to see how the @entity139 responds to events after the @entity9 election			0
