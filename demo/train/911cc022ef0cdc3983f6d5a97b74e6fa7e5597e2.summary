if that is n't a wave out there on the horizon , it is , at the moment anyway , a big , @entity7 - leaning ripple			1
consider this : -- a new @entity11 / @entity10 poll shows president @entity13 's standing on terrorism issues is in sharp decline just as voter concerns about @entity17 is climbing			1
-- in that same poll , released monday , more and more @entity18 see the country as heading in the wrong direction -- always one of the most telling indicators of the electorate 's mood			1
-- recent days also have brought a handful of polls in key @entity29 races that suggest @entity7 advantages in @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 and only a narrow @entity35 lead in @entity36			1
odds of a @entity7 takeover of the @entity29 are looking up eight weeks to @entity39			2
@entity11 poll : key @entity29 race a dead heat @entity11 poll : @entity43 holds slim edge in @entity31 " it 's much better to be a @entity7 candidate than a @entity35 candidate , at least at the moment , " says veteran @entity7 pollster @entity45			1
" yes , the @entity7 brand sucks , but it is the president 's image that dominates midterm elections , not that of our party			1
" if nothing else , the next few days are going to reinvigorate the debate over what constitutes a wave			0
smart operatives in both parties for weeks now have shied away from that word -- mostly because there are fewer competitive @entity66 districts now than in past cycles			0
so , even if the @entity7 has a great @entity39 , it is unrealistic to believe there could be a 30 - seat gain in the @entity66 , as the @entity35 enjoyed in 2006			2
or a 60 - seat pickup like the @entity73 wave in 2010			0
this cycle , @entity7 strategists say a great night would be adding 15 - 18 seats to the @entity7 majority ; @entity35 are hoping to keep their losses in single digits			2
@entity80 to - do list : avoid shutdown , go campaigning but the improving @entity29 climate for @entity7 has reignited " wave " talk			2
" i am now expecting a substantial @entity7 @entity29 wave in november , with a net gain of at least seven seats , " the veteran prognosticator @entity87 wrote monday			2
@entity45 is waiting for a bit more evidence			0
" i do n't see any evidence of a wave like we had in ' 06 or ' 08 , " says @entity45			0
" but a few more polls like the one you cite could get me to change my mind			0
" in the @entity11 poll numbers , the encouraging news for the president is that he and the public are largely in sync about how muscular to be in responding to @entity17			1
a clear majority opposes @entity18 combat boots on the ground , but 50 % support using other military force , up from 34 % a year ago			1
challenges to predicting the november election results but there is this damning finding : 67 % say @entity13 does not have a clear plan for dealing with @entity17			1
plus , only 37 % approve of how he is handling @entity17 , and just 41 % approve of his handling of the broader terrorism issue			2
perhaps the president can change those bad reviews with his speech to the nation later this week			0
even so , his job approval rating is stagnant at 43 % , and the percentage of @entity18 who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55 % , up from 50 % in april			1
again , eight weeks is a long time			0
and @entity35 insist they will again surprise us with superior voter outreach and turnout			0
but for now , the numbers are compelling : a weak president and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave			0
or a really big ripple .			0

poll numbers indicate a *sizable* advantage for @entity7 in this year 's midterms
@entity13 's approval numbers are low ; more *people* think @entity18 is heading in wrong direction
a new @entity11 poll shows voter concerns about @entity17 are rising
