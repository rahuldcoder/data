@entity8 , @entity3 -- " smoking hot " was how many observers described @entity3 prime minister @entity2 's blistering attack on sexism and misogyny in the bear pit of @entity3 's @entity7 on tuesday			1
the roar of support from @entity3 women on @entity13 was deafening			2
so too was their rage when the parliamentary press gallery almost uniformly condemned @entity2 's excoriation of the @entity19 coalition , @entity20 , as hypocritical and showing poor political judgment			1
for 15 minutes @entity2 tore into @entity20 before the @entity22 , the expression on his face going from a wry smile to embarrassment			1
the occasion was a highly charged debate on a motion brought by @entity20 to sack the @entity30 , @entity31			1
@entity31 , a coalition turncoat who helped the government bolster its numbers by taking up the highly paid position last year , stepped aside in april amid allegations of fraud and sexual harassment			2
in court documents published last week , text messages between @entity41 and his accuser in the sexual harassment action revealed deeply disturbing and offensive banter			1
in one of the messages , @entity31 described female genitalia as looking like " a mussel removed from its shell			1
" @entity20 said the messages showed @entity31 was not fit to be the standard - bearer of good behavior in @entity7			1
@entity2 , while condemning the text messages , refused to support the motion to sack @entity41			1
instead , she unfurled two years of pent up rage at the coalition leader for what she described as his own sexist , misogynistic attitude toward her and women generally			2
shock jock targets @entity2 " i will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man			0
i will not , " she said , pointing at @entity20			0
" and the government will not be lectured about sexism and misogyny by this man			0
not now , not ever			0
" if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern @entity3 , he does n't need a motion in the @entity22			2
" the prime minister then presented her evidence			0
she reminded @entity20 of his response to a question about lower female representation in positions of power : " what if men are by physiology or temperament more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command ? " she then cited his statements that " abortion is the easy way out " and " what the housewives of @entity3 need to understand as they do the ironing ... " during a debate on the recently introduced carbon tax			1
" i was offended too , " @entity2 continued , " by the sexism , by the misogyny of the @entity97 catcalling across this table at me , as i sit here as prime minister , ' if the prime minister wants to , politically speaking , make an honest woman of herself , ' something that would never have been said to any man sitting in this chair			2
" i was offended when the leader of the opposition went outside in the front of @entity7 and stood next to a sign that said ' ditch the witch			1
' " but the prime minister 's anger turned into white - hot rage when she responded to @entity20 's assertion , made during his speech in support of tuesday 's motion to sack the speaker , that every day @entity2 supported @entity41 was " another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame			1
" just a week earlier , a coalition - supporting commercial radio presenter , @entity121 , provoked outrage across the nation when he told a gathering of young @entity125 that the prime minister 's recently deceased father had " died of shame			0
" the prime minister had refused to comment on the controversy			0
yesterday she broke her silence : " i indicate to the leader of the opposition , the government is not dying of shame , my father did not die of shame			0
what the leader of the opposition should be ashamed of is his performance in this parliament and the sexism he brings with it , " she said			2
not long after @entity144 's motion narrowly failed in a parliamentary vote , with the prime minister victorious , @entity31 resigned his post			1
@entity2 's speech has ignited excitement and debate internationally			2
the venerable @entity152 magazine implored @entity154 president @entity153 to learn a lesson from the way politics is played in @entity3			0
" after his performance last week , supporters of president @entity153 , watching @entity2 cut through the disingenuousness and feigned moral outrage of her opponent to call him out for his own personal prejudice , hypocrisy , and aversion to facts , might be wishing their man would take a lesson from @entity3 , " it intoned			1
@entity172 's @entity171 applauded @entity2 for pulling no punches but noted the prime minister " is n't quite the stuff of feminist fantasies " because she has repeatedly refused to support same sex marriage in @entity3			1
from the journalists permanently reporting from the @entity3 @entity7 , there were many questions -- in particular why the prime minister welcomed @entity31 's resignation over his bawdy and offensive text messages but was unprepared to sack him ? @entity184 , political and international editor for the @entity185 , led the charge			1
@entity2 faced a choice , he wrote , " between the political defense of her parliamentary numbers or the defense of the principle of respect for women			0
" she made the wrong choice , wrote @entity184			0
the prime minister chose power over principle in deciding not to support the sacking of the house speaker and in so doing , " the prime minister gained nothing and lost a great deal , " he added			0
taking the pulse of social media , there are very few women who agree with him			0
" where does he get off taking the high moral ground pffft ! " posted @ abissicus on @entity13			0
" what utter s * * * " wrote @ vikkiking88			0
@entity3 now has a female prime minister , a female speaker of the house -- elected after @entity41 resigned -- and a female governor - general			2
just another day in @entity3 politics .			0
