-- @entity3 's swollen @entity2 was slowly receding along its entire length tuesday after federal authorities flooded it to save the @entity7 cities of @entity8 and @entity9 , the @entity1 reported			1
the @entity2 crested at more than six feet above flood stage at @entity11 , about 80 miles west of @entity8 , and forecasters are projecting a long , steady decline , said @entity14 , a meteorologist at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
the river 's peak at @entity11 was 10.35 feet -- barely two inches below its historic high - water mark in 1973 -- " and now it 's slowly , slowly falling , " @entity14 said			1
@entity21 , a resident of nearby @entity22 , said the water rose about halfway up @entity11 's sea wall , where the name of the town is etched into the concrete			1
" the water is up over the wall , and it 's like the word @entity11 is sitting in the water , " he said			1
some businesses along the waterfront outside the sea wall flooded , but the sea wall -- and a massive barge sunk into nearby @entity36 -- prevented high water from reaching neighborhoods in and around the area , @entity21 said			0
" the blessing is there 's no rain			2
if you had the amount of rain you had in 1973 , you would have a much worse problem , " said @entity21 , who lived in @entity22 during that year 's flood and now serves as chairman of a local flood - control district			0
the @entity50 began diverting water from the @entity7 into the @entity52 on may 14 by opening the @entity53 above @entity9			2
the agency began closing the spillway last wednesday , shutting seven of the 17 bays opened during the operation by tuesday evening , @entity50 spokeswoman @entity54 said			0
at the peak of the diversion , as much as 1.2 million gallons of water per second were pouring into the @entity52 from the @entity7 , the @entity50 reported			2
the @entity2 may not reach its normal levels until " well into june , " @entity14 said			0
officials said last week that flooding in the basin was not as severe as expected after the spillway 's opening			0
but at least 1,230 structures in 13 parishes were affected by rising water , according to the state @entity71 and @entity73 office .			0
