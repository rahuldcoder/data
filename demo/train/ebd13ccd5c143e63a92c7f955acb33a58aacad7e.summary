@entity0 -- the image was horrific : a whimpering beagle , ribs showing through its fur , tethered to a post inside the no - go zone around the worst nuclear accident since @entity10			2
the scene was captured by freelance journalists who drove through towns within a few kilometers of the @entity15 nuclear power plant , and who left food for the animal			1
but animal rescue activists who have braved the exclusion zone around the plant say there many others like it			2
" i understand the nuclear danger and everything , but they 're just being left to starve to death , basically , " said @entity24 of @entity25 and @entity26			1
@entity24 and others like her have been slipping into the 20 - km radius around @entity15 to retrieve pets and feed livestock left behind when their owners were forced to evacuate			1
pet owners have sent her group their addresses , accompanied by pleas to rescue their animals , left behind when they fled for what was supposed to be a short time			1
a month later , the volunteers are putting their long - term health on the line , putting on protective gear and entering the 20 - km radius around the plant that was declared off - limits in the early days of the crisis			2
@entity52 's 5 - year - old @entity51 , @entity53 , is among those rescued by @entity24 's group			0
@entity56 said she left food for the dog , but did n't expect to be gone a month			1
" we tried to save him , but we could n't get in , " @entity56 said			1
radiation levels recorded by photographers @entity63 and @entity64 were not high enough to cause immediate illness , but would pose potential health risks with prolonged exposure			0
@entity24 said she knows the risks , " but i feel personally that the risk that there is is worth taking for what i can achieve by doing so			0
" from the prime minister 's office to town halls , @entity73 authorities told @entity1 they have no provisions for dealing with animals when their owners are ordered to clear out -- orders that have been expanded to other towns around the crippled power plant , which has been emitting radioactive particles since the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out its coolant systems			1
@entity24 called that " unforgivable			0
" " i understand they have a huge problem as far as people are concerned			0
they are dealing with a lot , " she said			0
" but , i mean , there are people and groups who would be willing to help , and surely they could kind of set some sort of well - coordinated effort			0
" the fate of the tethered @entity96 and @entity64 captured on video was not known early thursday .			0

many owners left pets behind when evacuations were ordered
" we tried to save him , but we could n't get in , " one says
