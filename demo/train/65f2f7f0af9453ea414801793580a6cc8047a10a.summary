@entity0 -- @entity2 vs. @entity3 -- the clash of the titans			1
@entity6 , left , was picked to be director of national intelligence and @entity8 to head the @entity2			1
in the old world , the @entity2 director ruled			1
he not only ran the spy agency , but he wore a second hat as director of central intelligence			1
the @entity14 was ostensibly responsible for coordinating the activities of all 16 agencies and departments which make up the intelligence community			2
then came along the @entity3 ( director of national intelligence ) in 2005 -- a product of intelligence reform following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in @entity24			1
those intelligence failures were proof that you needed one person to focus exclusively on guiding the community			0
running the @entity2 in itself was a full - time job			0
the @entity3 would oversee the entire intelligence community while the @entity2 director concentrated on running the spy agency			1
but there 's a problem with this setup			0
although the @entity3 was given more input into budgets and personnel than the @entity14 had , the @entity3 's powers are limited and somewhat vague			2
the intelligence chief has a say in lots of things , but there 's no real muscle behind his decisions			0
it 's not like the defense secretary , who has absolute authority over all department components			0
outgoing cia director @entity50 recently told reporters there is natural tension between the @entity2 and @entity3 , but it 's " not a bad structure			1
" he did suggest , however , that the @entity3 's office was getting a bit bloated			0
" @entity58 being @entity58 , they 're going to fill up their day trying to doing something impactful , " he said , " which means between the two of us there 's going to be a trench line ... out there			0
" and how did departing @entity3 @entity65 respond to @entity50 's quip ? " anytime you have organizations that have similar interests , you 're going to have disputes , " he said			2
" and particularly if the two leaders are n't working together and having a partnership and so on , the warfare at the trench level gets to be pretty much a raging battle			0
" @entity76 said he had a good professional relationship with @entity50 , so they made it work			0
but he added , " we do n't have a department of intelligence			0
if this were the @entity86 , there would n't be any question , but it is n't			0
" @entity2 nominee @entity8 got into the middle of the dispute during his confirmation hearing			1
sen. @entity92 , @entity93 , wanted to know @entity8 's understanding of the relationship between the @entity2 and the @entity3			1
would he be under the supervision of the @entity3 ? initially , @entity8 said he reported to the @entity3 and performed the tasks assigned to him by the @entity3 , but then he added : " we are an operational arm , just like the [ @entity99 ] , just like the [ @entity100 ] , and i believe the role of the @entity3 is to coordinate all our activities ... " well , the @entity99 and the @entity100 are part of the @entity86 and report directly to the defense secretary , not the @entity3			1
the @entity2 is the only intelligence agency that is not part of another department			2
a bit baffled by @entity8 's response , sen. @entity110 , @entity111 , asked him point blank , " is the @entity3 your boss or not ? " @entity8 's answer , " the @entity3 is my boss			2
" it makes you wonder how @entity8 and the other new guy -- @entity3 @entity6 -- will play in the sand box .			2

@entity3 oversees entire intelligence community ; @entity2 director concentrates on spy agency
director of national intelligence role arose partly from reforms after 9/11
@entity128 and *ex-cia* director both cite tensions between the organizations
@entity8 was *pressed* on who 's in charge at his confirmation hearing
