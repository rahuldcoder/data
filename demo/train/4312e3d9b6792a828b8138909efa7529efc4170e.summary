-- @entity1 , creator of the first cartridge - based videogame console , died saturday morning in a @entity4 , @entity5 , hospital , @entity7 has learned			1
as an engineer at @entity9 , @entity1 designed the electronics of the @entity11 , later renamed the @entity12 , in 1976			1
predating the release of @entity14 's @entity14 by a year , the @entity12 was the first videogame machine that used interchangeable game cartridges , which @entity9 sold separately			1
previous game machines like @entity14 's " @entity17 " and the @entity18 had all their games built into the hardware			1
@entity1 's pioneering design set the standard for the game consoles of today			1
" @entity29 was an amazing personality , " said family friend @entity24 , who broke the news of @entity1 's death monday on the @entity28 website			1
" he created part of the videogame industry history in @entity33 and it was always a pleasure to hear his stories about back in the day			1
" much of @entity1 's background is discussed in a wide - ranging interview he gave @entity37 in 2009			2
a lifelong engineer and tinkerer , @entity1 was born in 1940 and grew up in a federal housing project in @entity41 , @entity42			1
as a kid , he operated a ham radio ; as a teenager he earned money by repairing his neighbors ' television sets			2
in the 1970s , living and working in @entity33 , he joined the @entity49 , a group of early hackers that included @entity52 co-founders @entity51 and @entity53			2
@entity1 's contributions to videogames began with " @entity56 , " a coin - operated arcade machine that he created in his garage while working at @entity9			1
" @entity9 found out about it -- in fact , it was a big controversy that i had done that			2
and then , very quietly , they asked me if i wanted to do it for them , " @entity1 said in the @entity64 interview			2
although similar machines were in development at @entity14 and @entity72 at the time , the console @entity1 's team built for @entity9 was the first cartridge - based gaming system that came to market			2
although it seems simple now , making the technology work was n't easy			2
" there was a mechanism that allowed you to put the cartridges in without destroying the semiconductors ...			1
we were afraid -- we did n't have statistics on multiple insertion and what it would do , and how we would do it , because it was n't done			0
i mean , think about it : nobody had the capability of plugging in memory devices in mass quantity like in a consumer product			0
" only 26 cartridges were ever released for @entity12 , all simple games like " @entity98 , " " @entity99 " and " @entity100			1
" when @entity101 released its cartridge - based system , @entity12 was quickly rendered obsolete			1
years later , @entity1 started his own company , @entity103 , to produce @entity14 cartridges , but only released one , a technician 's tool called " @entity108			1
" last month , the @entity109 honored @entity1 's pioneering efforts at @entity111 in @entity112			0
" the whole reason i did games was because people said , ' you ca n't do it , ' " he told the @entity113 last month			0
" i 'm one of the guys , if you tell me i ca n't do something , i 'll turn around and do it			0
" in later years , @entity1 had suffered the severe effects of diabetes			0
he lost sight in one eye and lost one of his legs to the disease , leaving him confined to a wheelchair			0
on wednesday , not feeling well , he was admitted into @entity131			0
" he continued building devices to control telescopes , lasers , tools , etc. up until the day he went to the hospital , " said friend @entity24			0
" his workbench had more tools than most people would even know what to do with			0
he taught me quite a bit and i 'll miss him sorely			0
" at 6:15 a.m. saturday , @entity1 died after apparently suffering a heart attack			1
he is survived by his wife , son and daughter			0
the family is planning a memorial service in mid-may			0
