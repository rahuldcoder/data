@entity0 -- the @entity2 knew of the threat posed by roadside bombs before the start of the @entity7 war , yet did nothing to buy protective vehicles for troops , according to a report to be released by the @entity12			1
@entity2 ' armored humvees are parked at a miltary camp in @entity15 , @entity7 , in may 2007			0
additionally , @entity2 leaders in 2005 decided to buy up - armored , or reinforced , humvees instead of @entity19 - protected vehicles to shield troops in @entity7 from mines and other explosives -- a decision that could have cost lives , according to the report obtained tuesday by @entity1			1
the report by the @entity12 inspector general was requested by the @entity2 in early 2008 after a civilian employee with the service complained that bureaucratic delays undermined the program to develop the armored vehicles			1
inspectors found that the decision not to buy @entity36 vehicles in 2005 stopped the @entity37 , the agency in charge of finding the best protective vehicle from troops in @entity7 , from " developing a course of action ... to attempt to obtain funding for [ mraps ] , " according to the report			1
the report found that the @entity12 knew before the war started in 2003 of the threats of mines and roadside bombs in @entity7 but did nothing to acquire " @entity36 - type " vehicles ahead of the invasion			1
" as a result , the department entered into operations in @entity7 without having taken available steps to acquire technology to mitigate the known mine and ied risk to soldiers and @entity2 , " the report said			2
in response to the report , @entity2 spokesman maj. @entity61 pointed out the inspector general found no " evidence of criminal negligence " in the @entity2 ' actions			0
the decision to buy the up - armored @entity70 model , he said , was made " consciously by the @entity2 leadership because of its proven capability to protect and its tactical utility ; the survivability and mobility demanded by the @entity2 in theater ; and its availability , based on an active , responsive production line			0
" " @entity79 fully cooperated with [ inspector general ] during this audit , " @entity61 said			0
" we are reviewing the report to ensure that our processes best support the war fighter in theater			0
" a civilian whistle - blower working with the @entity2 on the @entity36 program wrote a scathing report about delays in the procurement process in early 2008			2
" if the mass procurement and fielding of @entity36 had begun in 2005 in response to the known and acknowledged threats at that time , as the @entity2 is doing today , hundreds of deaths and injuries could have been prevented , " @entity92 wrote in his january report			2
he said bureaucratic delays plagued the program at the height of the insurgency , when @entity105 troops were regularly being attacked and killed by roadside bombs			0
@entity108 's report prompted the @entity2 to request the inspector general 's audit in 2008			0
the @entity108 report drew attention just months after @entity36 had been pushed into @entity7 by defense secretary @entity113 in an effort to protect troops from roadside bombs -- the leading killer of troops at the time .			1
