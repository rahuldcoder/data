-- over the past couple of weeks , i have been asking random people who identify as @entity4 if they trust @entity5 , and each of them gave me an answer like this -- " i trust him more than i trust @entity10			1
" it 's just a long winded way of saying " no. " they said they did want to see his taxes			0
they said they have reservations about a major tax plan lacking specifics			1
some said they saw the video of him describing himself as a pro-abortion rights moderate ; others knew that in the hardcover version of his book " no apology , " he expressed pride in @entity31 and believed that " we can accomplish the same thing for everyone in the country			0
" they know he flip flops			1
and yet , their dislike of president @entity10 is so strong that they 're willing to overlook that whole character thing and swallow the bitter pill that is @entity5			1
how can they do that , you say ? well for starters , @entity10 is n't exactly a rock of @entity49 himself			1
@entity55 's " @entity54 " has been keeping track of the more than 500 promises the president made during the 2008 campaign and found thus far he 's kept 37 % of them			2
he 's broken 16 % , compromised on 14 % and is still working on another 22 %			0
so even though @entity5 smells , @entity10 's not exactly lilacs			1
he promised to address gun control			0
he promised to close @entity58			0
@entity10 was for gay marriage , then he was against it , and now he 's for it again			2
if you believe his evolution was n't about politics , then you probably believe @entity66 was robbed in 1980			0
this is why some @entity4 are willing to vote for a guy they may not trust : he 's viewed as the lesser of two evils			2
but pointing out the evils in the other party does nothing to address the evils in their own			0
here 's the thing : the question of trusting @entity5 has nothing to do with @entity10			1
voters might not like to think about that too much , but they need to look beyond campaign sleight of hand to give it some serious thought because the future of the middle class depends on it			0
this week , both @entity5 and vp hopeful @entity88 have been touting a multitrillion dollar tax - cutting plan with no details , essentially asking voters to take it on faith that it 'll all work out			1
many conservative pundits , including @entity96 , say @entity5 's math -- where it exists -- is a bit fuzzy and all @entity5 can say is " trust me			2
" so again , i ask @entity4 : do you ? not in comparison to @entity10 , but in comparison to your understanding of the word trust			1
knowing what you know -- and do n't know			0
because if he wins , saying " i trust him more than i trust @entity10 " is not going to help matters in january			2
it 's not going to protect the middle class ' ability to write off the interest on their mortgages or deduct charitable giving			0
@entity5 said the plan wo n't touch those deductions , but he wo n't tell us which deductions it will touch			1
trust him with our taxes , he says			0
and yet , he wo n't trust us to even look at his			1
at the @entity125 , @entity5 's wife , @entity124 , painted a picture of their early years together as if the two of them were barely getting by			1
and then an old @entity131 interview surfaced in which she said " we were happy , studying hard			0
neither one of us had a job , because @entity5 had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time			0
" realizing that struggling college students work and do n't usually live off investments , she backed away from her earlier characterization , telling " @entity141 " later that , " @entity5 and i do recognize that we have not had a financial struggle in our lives			2
" @entity148 ... you do know that she did n't just realize this , right ? you do know that her speech was designed to manipulate voters in an attempt to paint her husband as a regular @entity154 , a guy just like them , someone they could trust			1
so ... do you ? do you trust @entity5 ? @entity10 has only kept 37 % of his promises			1
but @entity55 's @entity158 , which they describe as having followed " dozens of promises made in 2010 by @entity125 leaders " and in their pledge to @entity161 , found that the @entity4 has only kept 19 % of its promises			2
if you ca n't trust a guy who has only kept 37 % of his promises , how do you trust leaders that have only kept 19 % of theirs ? better yet , how do you trust a guy , who as governor of @entity169 , signed an assault weapon ban in 2004 , reiterated his support for a ban in 2007 and then shows up at an @entity174 convention in 2012 talking like some sort of @entity177 wannabe ? i do n't think you can			2
which i guess is why many @entity4 have a hard time saying they do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

@entity185 : asked if they trust @entity5 , a *group* of @entity4 replied , " more than @entity10 "
@entity185 says @entity5 flip flops and lies ; he wants us to trust him on tax plan he wo n't *explain*
he says @entity10 has also broken promises , played politics , but @entity4 track record worse
@entity183 : the @entity198 paint early years as humble to faux - relate to voters
