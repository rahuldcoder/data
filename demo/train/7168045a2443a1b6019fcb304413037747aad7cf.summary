three billion miles away from @entity5 , in an unchartered slice of our solar system , a small space probe is shaking off its deep sleep and getting ready to become the first spacecraft to visit @entity8 and its moons			1
it 's the " beginning of the mission 's primary objective : the exploration of @entity8 and its many moons in 2015 , " said @entity15 , @entity16 principal investigator from @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , in a @entity21 news release			1
@entity21 's @entity16 spacecraft was launched on january 19 , 2006			1
it 's down to the final 162 million miles of its journey and will arrive july 14 , 2015			1
@entity16 has had 18 hibernation periods totaling 1,873 days to save wear and tear on its components			2
this was its last nap			0
mission operators at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35 , say a preprogrammed command ordered the spacecraft to switch from hibernation to " active " at 9:53 p.m. ( est ) december 6			0
" this is a big deal			0
it means the start of our pre-encounter operations , " said @entity40 , @entity16 project manager at @entity33			2
the mission managers will spend several weeks checking out the spacecraft and testing computer commands to guide @entity16 through the rest of its flight			0
the probe is 27 inches ( 0.7 meters ) tall , 83 inches ( 2.1 meters ) long and 108 inches ( 2.7 meters ) wide			0
it weighed 1,054 pounds ( 478 kilograms ) at launch			0
@entity16 is packed with cameras and other instruments , and it should start sending back glimpses of @entity8 on january 15			1
by mid-may , we should get " better than @entity58 " photos			0
until now , the best image we 've had of @entity8 is a pixilated photo from the @entity58			0
we 'll also see @entity8 's five moons : @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
@entity16 was launched before the big debate started over whether it 's a planet			0
for the scientists on the @entity16 team , @entity8 is very much a planet -- just a new kind of planet			1
" @entity16 is on a journey to a new class of planets we 've never seen , in a place we 've never been before , " says new horizons project scientist @entity73 of @entity33			2
" for decades , we thought @entity8 was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts ; now we know it 's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the @entity86 , and @entity16 is going to provide the first close - up look at them			1
" @entity21 : how @entity8 got its name			1

@entity16 *awakens* from its final hibernation
