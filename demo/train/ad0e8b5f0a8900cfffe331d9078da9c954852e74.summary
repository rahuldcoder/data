-- the scandal - hit @entity3 will appoint a board to decide whether the @entity7 company should take legal action and file criminal complaints against executives who helped hide $ 1.7 billion in losses , the company president said wednesday			1
the comments from @entity3 president @entity13 come a day after the findings of a scathing independent panel report that suggested the @entity7 company " should remove its malignant cancer			1
" the management was rotten to the core , and infected those around it , " the panel 's report said			1
the panel , led by a former @entity7 @entity25 judge , detailed $ 1.7 billion of hidden losses from failed investments in the 1990s by the camera and medical equipment maker			1
the report , issued tuesday , blasted the culture of the company that allowed the losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for companies , as well as the tight control of former company chairman @entity37			1
@entity3 has lost half its share value in the wake of the october 14 firing of former ceo @entity42 , the first foreigner to lead the company , after @entity42 questioned the company 's accounting			1
after @entity42 went public with his claims , the company 's share value dropped by as much as 75 %			0
three former executives , including @entity37 , have since resigned from the company 's management			2
" one had to be prepared to be kicked out of the company in order to make objection even if it was the right thing to do ( this is also apparent in how @entity42 was treated ) , " the panel wrote in its report			1
the panel reiterated its earlier announcement that their investigation found no link to " anti-social forces , " a euphemism to @entity7 organized crime			2
@entity66 officials said in a statement that the report " includes both new revelations and recommendations on the future management of @entity3 ( and ) will be taken into serious consideration by the company			1
" the independent panel recommended the resignation of the entire @entity3 board			1
@entity13 said at wednesday 's press conference that he and the board will resign but not until the " exact responsibilities " of wrongdoing are revealed by investigators			0
resignations and changes to company management would likely come after a shareholder 's meeting sometime in february			0
the company faces a december 14 deadline to resubmit its financial statement to the @entity90 or face delisting			0
@entity66 officials have repeatedly said they will turn in the required documents before next week 's deadline			0
the @entity3 saga started with a five - page expose in @entity7 magazine facta -- a small circulation magazine that has only nine people on staff -- on july 20 that raised questions over advisory fees of $ 687 million paid in 2008 for the purchase of @entity102 , a @entity103 medical instruments firm			1
the article also questioned the $ 773 million paid for three small @entity7 companies -- a face cream maker , a plastic container maker and a recycling business , each with fewer than 50 employees			0
@entity42 has led a public campaign since his dismissal to get rid of the company board , and has said he would return to run the company if asked			0
" the panel 's report has made one thing painfully clear : the massive scale of the malfeasance from which the present directors and statutory auditors persistently averted their gaze , " @entity42 said in a statement			2
" i sought to call attention to the wrongdoing through a series of six letters in @entity128 and @entity7 , copied to all the members of the board , and through the submission of a damning report by @entity133			2
yet not a single director stood up in support of my efforts to expose what had taken place			0
" @entity13 said the board will decide whether to bring @entity42 back at the next shareholders meeting			2
" @entity42 did what we all could n't do , so we praise him for that , " @entity13 said			0
