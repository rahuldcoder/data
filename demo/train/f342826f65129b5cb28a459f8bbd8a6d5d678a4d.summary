-- @entity1 have struck back at @entity4 senators ' filibusters of president @entity6 's three current nominees to the @entity8 circuit			1
the struggle signals an escalation of the confirmation battles in which the courts and litigants are largely innocent victims			0
@entity15 has authorized a set number of judgeships for each of the 13 courts of appeals , including 11 for the @entity8			1
filling vacancies in those judgeships has become more contentious over the last 20 years			1
the @entity23 approved 88 % of president @entity25 's nominees , but that figure has been in the low 70s since the @entity29 administration			0
@entity25 's appellate judges got confirmed on average in 60 days			0
for president @entity29 , the average was 238 days , a number that shot up to 355 for president @entity35 and is currently 257 for @entity6 's appointees			0
eight of the 11 judgeships on the @entity8 circuit are filled			1
four of the eight were appointed by @entity4 presidents , four by @entity1 presidents , including one by @entity6 ( confirmed by a lopsided 97 - 0 )			1
in addition , six judges now in a form of semiretirement hear some cases			0
of the six , five were appointed by @entity4 presidents			1
those facts are important not because judges always decide cases the way their appointing president 's party might prefer			0
they do n't ; most cases in the courts of appeals do n't present issues with much of a policy implication at all			0
but numerous empirical studies of judges ' decisions in large numbers of cases with policy implications have demonstrated that , on some issues more than others , the party of the appointing president is an indicator , albeit a weak one , of how judges will decide cases -- for or against environmental claims , for example , or labor union claims -- especially in cases in which existing law is unclear			0
the @entity8 gets a high proportion of cases with policy implications because it receives a comparatively high number of cases involving decisions made by administrative agencies , such as the @entity85 and the @entity86			2
that fact is basic to the battle over @entity6 's nominees , although it 's hard to tell from the back and forth			2
@entity4 say there is no need to fill the vacancies because the @entity8 has a lower caseload than the other appellate courts			1
the leader of the resistance , sen. @entity97 , @entity98 , told a recent @entity102 hearing that the country needs " smart ways to reallocate our judicial resources " -- and he 's right on that point , given that @entity15 has created no new appellate judgeships for 23 years and seems in no mood to start doing so			2
so @entity97 has introduced legislation to transfer two of the vacant judgeships to other courts of appeals , and abolish the third in order to save money			0
@entity1 have said that @entity6 is duty - bound to nominate judges for the vacancies because the @entity119 says " he shall nominate ... judges of the supreme court , and all other officers of the @entity124 " ( which includes lower court judges )			0
but if a court clearly does not need all its vacancies filled , few would fault a president for not submitting nominations			2
that the @entity8 does not need more judges , though , is hardly clear			2
both sides sling around cherry - picked statistics , with republicans emphasizing raw case numbers and @entity1 stressing the court 's comparatively large number of complex agency cases			2
as explained , though , by a representative of the federal court 's governing body , there is currently no reliable statistical method to compare the workloads of the courts of appeals			0
@entity4 have also said that the current four - four balance of @entity4 and @entity1 appointees on the court should n't be upset			1
in fact , readjusting the party - of - appointing president balance has been a goal of @entity1 and @entity4 presidents			1
that helps explain why the @entity23 refused to confirm two of @entity29 's five nominees to the @entity8 and two of @entity35 's six nominees			1
it 's hard to say how this battle will end			0
the obvious solution is to confirm the three nominees and then urge the judiciary itself to come up with a reliable way to compare the workload of the courts of appeals , as it has for district courts			1
if it shows that the @entity8 can do its work with eight judgeships , @entity15 can shift the next three vacancies as they occur ( three of the active judges are eligible to retire and either have reached 70 years of age or soon will )			1
obvious , though , does n't mean likely			0
instead , @entity1 moved thursday to take away the @entity178 ' ability to use filibusters to block lower court nominations			1
the @entity8 three will probably get confirmed -- but at a cost			2
some , even while acknowledging filibuster abuse by both sides , think abolishing filibusters will harm the @entity23 in the long run , to say nothing of the strain it will put on already frayed relations			0
the elimination of the filibuster impedes the ability of @entity178 to block more @entity6 appellate nominees			1
the balance among active judges on those courts when @entity6 took office was 60 - 40 @entity4 - to - @entity1 appointees			2
it 's now at 50 - 50 , and @entity4 were likely trying to keep it there			0
one unlikely result from this battle is any expansion of @entity97 's efforts to " reallocate " appellate judgeships			0
only one appellate court has lost a judgeship to another circuit -- the 2007 transfer of a @entity8 vacancy to the @entity212 , effective january 20 , 2009			1
the @entity8 would lose more under his bill , and it 's no coincidence that it 's the only court without a ( patronage - protecting ) @entity23 delegation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			0

@entity222 use " *nuclear* option " to strip @entity4 of ability to filibuster court nominations
@entity220 says filling judgeships has grown more contentious over 20 years
he says each party selects statistics that aim to *bolster* its side of the *debate*
@entity220 : confirm the three @entity8 nominees , then take hard look at court workload
