" " because the demographics of the country are such that you will lose a generation of immigrants which says , ' that party does n't seem to care about me , ' " he said			2
" in the short term , they have a problem with the tea party and others who often express virulently anti-immigrant sentiment			0

but he said " all the executive authority i legally have " wo n't be as effective as @entity44 approving legislation would be			0
@entity2 said he will make visa changes to allow more technically skilled workers to enter the @entity10 , and noted that naturalized @entity10 have won 25 % of the country 's @entity48 in the sciences			2
" and so the idea that we would make it harder for talent to come here -- especially when so often that talent is coming to study here , going to school here , wants to stay here , wants to work here , wants to invest here -- makes no sense , " he said			0
@entity2 had planned to sign an immigration - related executive order by now as part of his " pen and phone " strategy to bypass a gridlocked @entity44			1
