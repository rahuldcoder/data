@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 authorities have bolstered their search for a missing @entity7 citizen and the government rejects assertions that security forces are n't doing enough to find him , the foreign ministry said friday			1
@entity12 has been missing since a reported pirate attack september 30 on a lake bisected by the @entity7 - @entity1 border			1
@entity12 's wife , @entity17 , told authorities her husband was shot and killed by pirates on @entity21 during a sightseeing trip			1
his body has yet to be found , leading to questions about the accuracy of her statements			1
the ministry said the federal attorney general 's office opened an investigation based on testimony @entity31 gave to @entity1 authorities at the consulate in @entity34 , @entity35			1
the government also has been in close touch with several @entity7 authorities			2
" the search and rescue for mr. @entity12 started the day of the incident , and intensified this week with additional officers from the @entity44 , the @entity45 , and from state and municipal forces , which cover the area where the incident reportedly took place , " the ministry said			1
on thursday , @entity31 said she might take a lie detector test if people continue to doubt the veracity of her account			1
if " that 's what the authorities think i need to do , then that might be an option , " she said when asked on @entity2 's " @entity55 " about taking a lie detector test			2
@entity12 was on several @entity2 shows thursday recounting what happened last week on @entity21			2
she also talked about her feelings about people doubting her account of the alleged attack			2
@entity12 said on @entity68 's " issues with @entity67 " that " i know what i know			1
" " it 's hard being judged and thought of that i might have done something to him , " she said			2
but she added , " as long as i know the truth , @entity74 knows the truth			2
and other than that , it almost does n't really matter to me , because i know what happened that day			0
" @entity1 authorities said earlier this week that they could not verify the shooting , and @entity12 was asked point - blank on @entity83 's " today " show wednesday whether she had anything to do with her husband 's disappearance			1
@entity88 , @entity89 's mother , said tuesday that any suggestion that her daughter - in - law 's account was inaccurate is " insane			0
" investigators have found some evidence that backs up @entity12 's account , including blood on her life vest , @entity94 sheriff @entity93 said thursday			2
and the incident was similar to other attacks reported by boaters on @entity21 , about 70 miles west of the @entity12 's home in @entity34			0
@entity93 has said the gunmen are typically teenagers hired by a drug cartel in the neighboring @entity1 state of @entity108			1
@entity1 authorities have said the lake is controlled on their side by " organized criminals , " and the sheriff called on the @entity114 cartel to turn over @entity12 's remains if they have them			1
" we just want a body , " he said			2
@entity31 said she believes the attackers took her 30 - year - old husband 's body after he was shot in the head and fell off the personal watercraft he was riding			1
she said she suspects her husband 's remains are more likely to have been dragged onto land than to have been left in the lake			2
" we do believe if they would just go ahead and give us @entity12 's body back , it would be done			2
we could go on with our lives , " she said			0
authorities from both nations are conducting separate searches and are coordinating and holding regular meetings , @entity136 spokeswoman @entity135 said			0
but because the alleged crime happened on the @entity1 side of the border , the @entity7 can not prosecute or make arrests in the case , the sheriff said			1
@entity31 , 29 , told @entity68 that the couple set out across the lake on personal watercraft for a sightseeing trip to @entity151 , a half - submerged ghost town on the @entity1 side of the lake			1
though there had been warnings about previous robberies on the lake , she said they had heard of no problems for several months , " so we figured everything had kind of calmed down			0
" instead , she said , they were pursued by men in three boats as they left the site 's historic church			2
at first , " they just waved at us like we were friendly , a very friendly wave , " she said			0
but then , as the couple passed , she said they began chasing them and firing shots			0
@entity89 was shot in the head and fell off his personal watercraft , and he was unresponsive when she turned back to try to retrieve him , his wife said			1
while she was trying to haul him onto her craft , their attackers pulled up alongside , she said			0
" they did n't say anything to me , so i do n't know what they were trying to do ... but they left , " she said			0
" they just left me there			0
thankfully they did n't shoot at me			0
they had a gun pointed at me			0
" unable to pull her husband 's body out of the water , @entity12 headed back across the lake to @entity7 waters			1
she said the gunmen fired " a few more " times on her way back			0
" once i started to get going , i just went as fast as i could and did n't look back until i could n't see them anymore , " she said			0
@entity200 , lead investigator for the @entity108 state police , described the area as " a conflict zone			0
" the state has made headlines recently as a hotbed for drug cartel violence , and there have been at least four cases of gunmen in @entity1 waters robbing or threatening boaters on @entity21 since april , according to the @entity213			1
@entity89 worked for an oil company in @entity216 , @entity1 , and the couple had lived on the @entity1 side of the @entity219 before moving back to the @entity7 earlier this year , family friends said			1
his aunt , @entity220 , told @entity68 's " @entity228 " the family had concerns about their safety in the area , " and we were all thrilled to hear that they were moving back to @entity226 , " where they grew up			1
" we 're all very devastated			0
it 's hard to even believe something like this could happen			0
we 're hanging in there , but it 's very , very difficult for the whole family , " @entity220 said			0
according to rep. @entity235 , @entity236 , 60 @entity1 personnel , three boats and a helicopter have taken part in the search			1
investigators resumed their work thursday despite threats to their lives , and @entity235 suggested that the @entity1 navy might need to be called in to help			1
despite the dangers on the @entity1 side of the lake , @entity35 officials on thursday said that the @entity7 side of the body of water remains safe			1
" it is just as safe now as any other time			0
however , there is a threat , " said rep. @entity256 , @entity236			0
@entity2 's @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0
