-- walk into any sleek @entity1 , and the first thing you 're likely to see is a giant red banner emblazoned with a white peace symbol			1
browse @entity7 , and you 'll be dazzled by backlit peace signs and multicolored peace - sign bedding			1
visit the ubiquitous gap store and find peace within reach on t - shirts and bracelets			1
peace is accessible , at least as an accessory			1
where are the protesters passionately waving hand - drawn peace signs at marches , calling for an end to war ? what happened to " @entity26 " rather than " give peace a place in your wardrobe " ? the notion of peace has been corroded to the point that it 's as fragile as a @entity35 ornament			1
or as dubious as a prize doled out to a president at war			0
fittingly , president @entity41 's @entity40 speech acknowledged the paradox of being honored for contributing to world peace while sending more young @entity44 to kill and die in @entity45			1
rationalizing the contradiction , he apologetically characterized humanity as caught in the throes of our own evolution , from who we are to who we ought to be			0
but what will spark that progress , from waging war to living peace ? it 's difficult to expect peace to take root beyond symbols and words if the symbols lose their meaning and the words ring hollow			1
how will we ever evolve if we always choose pragmatism and fear over idealism and hope ? when will peace truly have its season ? for starters , we must know what peace is and what it 's worth			1
and we must practice it rather than wait for its miraculous arrival			0
we must stop viewing " peace " as the cry of the weak and " war " as the act of the strong			1
we must not envision peace as isolationist inaction or the mere absence of conflict			1
peace is a proactive choice we make in our personal lives every day			1
we must do the same as a nation			0
in order to embrace peace , we must believe it 's worth doing so			1
ponder all the lives lost at war			0
consider the sacrifice endured by our brave soldiers and their families			0
weigh the enormous cost to our struggling economy			0
not only would thousands of lives be spared by peace , but millions more would benefit by the constructive use of the vast resources squandered on war			2
world hunger might be eliminated			0
prosperity and fulfillment might replace poverty and suffering around the globe			0
and it 's certainly not for the weak but rather for those courageous enough to take a risk			2
evolution begins with one mutation that turns out to be better , higher , smarter , stronger			2
making the leap requires faith in our own ability to lead the world by example through this evolutionary process			0
peace is a bold but calculated risk , a brave and noble choice			1
@entity129 said , " each one has to find his peace from within			2
and peace to be real must be unaffected by outside circumstances			2
" @entity135 @entity134 once declared , " there is no way to peace			2
" @entity141 said , " peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek but a means by which we arrive at that goal			2
" what i take from these wise thinkers is that peace starts with us and our actions			1
it 's not something we can put off forever			0
we must practice peace in order to attain it			2
as citizens , we must demand it			0
only then will elected officials -- and others around the world -- follow our lead			0
so when we purchase peace signs , let 's honor their meaning : the peace symbol , created in 1958 by designer @entity167 , combines the signals in semaphore for the letters " n " and " @entity172 , " standing for nuclear disarmament			1
by the 1960s , it was adopted by anti-war protesters of the baby boom generation , perhaps explaining its now nostalgic allure in boomer - frequented retail establishments , where the only conflict is whether to pick a throw pillow in sage , cranberry or chartreuse			2
just as we must not allow peace to become a meaningless trinket , we must n't allow the prize to become a parody			1
instead , we must remember the passion with which that peace sign was first hoisted at marches on capitols and on campuses			0
we must recall the fervor and nobility with which @entity40 laureates like @entity129 and @entity141 gave their lives pursuing nonviolent solutions			0
and we must stand for peace , in our actions , in our expectations of our leaders , and in our votes			1
we can not simply consume peace as an illusion			0
we must stop talking about peace in terms of who we ought to be and start making it who we are			0
because the day we stop fighting for peace is the day peace will be ours			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

@entity215 writes that " peace " has been reduced to meaningless symbol
peace is not for weak ; not just isolationist inaction or absence of conflict , @entity215 says
he writes that peace is noble , *contagious* action practiced by those with higher purpose
@entity215 says @entity44 must stand for peace in actions , in expectations of leaders , in votes
