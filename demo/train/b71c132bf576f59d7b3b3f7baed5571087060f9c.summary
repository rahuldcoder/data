@entity1 , @entity0 -- campaigners in @entity1 planned to petition the @entity5 government friday for a posthumous pardon for the hundreds of people executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries			1
witchcraft has not been punishable by death for nearly 300 years			1
they said @entity13 is a good time to highlight the " grave miscarriage of justice " suffered by the men and women falsely accused of being witches			1
their petition asks justice minister @entity21 to recommend that @entity22 issue a pardon			1
" we felt that it was time that the sinister associations held by a minority of people regarding witches and @entity13 were tackled head - on , " said @entity24 , head of @entity25 , a large costume supplier in @entity1			1
" we were gobsmacked to discover that though the law was changed hundreds of years ago and society had moved on , the victims were never officially pardoned			1
" @entity25 launched a web site , @entity38 , to solicit signatures for their petition			2
they had between 150 and 200 by friday morning , @entity25 spokesman @entity40 said , but they hoped @entity13 publicity would generate more			0
around 400 people were executed in @entity0 and some 4,000 in @entity44 for alleged witchcraft , campaigners say			1
the @entity46 put an end to trials of accused witches , but many still faced persecution and jail for other crimes such as fraud			1
" it shifted from a spiritual thing to more of a criminal thing , " @entity40 said , but " it did n't pardon those people who 'd suffered before			1
" the campaigners worked with witchcraft historian @entity60 to detail eight cases they hope will persuade the government to act			2
they include the case of @entity64 , a woman who offered cures in @entity66 , @entity0 in the 1500s			1
the uneven results of her work prompted accusations of witchcraft and she was hanged in 1582			2
a century later , @entity74 and @entity75 were begging for food in @entity77 , @entity0 , when a local woman blamed one of them for an illness and they were jailed			1
a jail visitor noticed @entity75 ' shaky hands and suggested she was " tormenting someone			0
" it started a string of rumors that resulted in an accusation of witchcraft , and the women were executed in 1682			2
in 1645 , clergyman @entity91 was regarded as too attached to @entity92 in a strongly @entity94 area			0
he had already defended himself once against witchcraft when he came to the attention of a notorious zealot named @entity98			2
@entity98 made @entity91 walk for days and nights until he was unable to resistconfessing to being a witch			0
@entity91 was hanged in @entity101 , @entity0 , after conducting his own funeral			2
" today we are well aware that these individuals were neither capable of harmful magic nor in league with the devil , " @entity60 said			0
he said the endemic poverty of the 16th to 18th centuries put pressure on leaders and the judiciary to blame someone for society 's problems -- so they decided to blame witches			2
" a lot of these cases were score - settling in local communities , " @entity40 said , adding many cases of alleged witchcraft were n't even reported			1
" the notion that people could suspend their disbelief and believe that women were talking to toads -- just horrible times			2
" in 2004 , one @entity44 town managed to get a pardon for the 81 accused witches that had been put to death there			1
the independent baron court in @entity134 , near @entity135 , pardoned them before the court was officially disbanded in november of that year			0
in its ruling , the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who , it said , were executed for " conjuration or sorcery			1
" it said their convictions were based on insufficient evidence that often relied on " voices " or the actions of " spirits " to attest to their guilt			0
a separate group petitioned the @entity44 parliament last month , asking for pardons for each of the 4,000 witches who were put to death across the nation			1
@entity158 , a medium with @entity160 , acknowledged it 's unlikely they will get a pardon for every accused witch , so the group is going ahead with a private memorial in @entity44 instead			1
" it would be an apology to all those accused , " said @entity158 , whose group investigates the paranormal			2
@entity40 said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution , their stories still generate suspicion and stigma			0
that extends to modern - day criticism of children dressing as witches at @entity13 with the idea that it 's evil or connected to the devil , he said			0
" witches were not emissaries of @entity187 , " @entity40 said			0
" they were in fact persecuted women and men who deserve a pardon			0
" a spokesman for the @entity193 would not comment on the case but said the granting of such a pardon is extremely rare			0
" to receive a royal pardon , the test is a high one , " the spokesman said			0
" evidence must prove conclusively that no offense was committed or that the applicant did not commit the offense			0
it is not enough that the conviction may be unsafe -- the applicant must be technically and morally innocent			0
" accused witches were also tried and put to death in the famous salem witch trials in the @entity212 state of @entity213 in the late 1600s , but all were later pardoned , said @entity215 , director of education at the @entity216			1
the names of 14 were cleared in 1711 after their families applied to the government , @entity215 said			0
gov. @entity220 cleared one name in 1957 , and then - gov. @entity222 cleared the remaining five in 2001 , she said			0
" their names are now on a list that makes it seem as though they were innocent , which they surely were , " @entity215 said .			0
