-- in rural @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity1 felt as if she were an epidemiologist , a sanitation department and a health inspector -- but in title , she was a nurse			1
she and colleagues carried everything , including the baby scales , as they set up temporary clinics in churches , schools and wherever else they could			1
in the 1940s and ' 50s , there was no one else taking care of these basic community needs except @entity18 and her fellow public health nurses			2
as she gained experience , @entity18 realized that more nurses should be able to have specialized training so they could make basic decisions on their own about the health status of patients			2
@entity18 , 90 , the co-founder of the nurse practitioner movement , is being inducted into the @entity27 on saturday in @entity28 , @entity29			1
thanks in large part to her efforts , there are more than 140,000 nurse practitioners working in the @entity35 today			1
many can prescribe and diagnose as doctors can , but their nursing background emphasizes health promotion and patient empowerment			1
" i 'm pretty proud of them			2
i get a lot of credit for 140,000 nurses and i do n't deserve it , " @entity18 said in september			2
" they 're the ones who fought the good fight			2
they took the heat and they stood it and they 've done beautifully			2
" who are the nurse practitioners ? nurse practitioners are allowed to have independent practices in 16 states and the @entity57 , and that number is growing -- two joined the list in 2011			1
in all states , they can prescribe most medications , although in some states they must collaborate with a physician for prescriptions ( @entity65 to @entity66 in @entity35 has this map showing restrictions )			1
there are 6 million visits to nurse practitioners every year , according to the @entity72			1
they are in high demand , because there is a shortage of primary care doctors in the @entity35 , where a huge chunk of the population is approaching old age and high obesity rates are aggravating diabetes and heart disease levels			2
although the training is different from medical school , nurse practitioners do invest a great deal of time in education : usually a bachelor 's degree in nursing and then two to four more years getting a graduate - level degree , sometimes in a specialty area such as family practice			1
about 93 % of nurse practitioners have graduate degrees , and there is currently a proposal by the @entity98 to require a doctorate - level degree to become a nurse practitioner by the year 2015			1
the nurse practitioner philosophy is a holistic approach to the health of the patient , @entity18 said			1
nurse practitioners focus on health , functionality and daily living , and giving the patient feedback			1
" the end result , of course , is to empower the patient or the family or the person to advance to self - care and to be responsible for that , " @entity18 said			2
@entity18 had wanted to be a teacher , but because of cost concerns she went to nursing school instead			2
during @entity120 , she worked as a nurse at various @entity123 and @entity124 bases			1
when the war ended , she attended the @entity126 and earned bachelor 's and master 's degrees			2
@entity18 's journey the 1960s were a time of social and political upheaval , and @entity18 saw that chaos as an opportunity to start something new			2
she collaborated with pediatrician dr. @entity137 to start the nation 's first pediatric nurse practitioner program in 1965 at the @entity141 's @entity140			1
they were interested in expanding public health nurses ' roles , emphasizing prevention and health promotion			2
" here she is practicing in rural @entity2 , she sees a need for a new profession , a better way of doing things , something that could really enhance health care and bring health care to more people , and so she created the whole profession , " said @entity147 , president of the @entity72			2
" that 's just an inspiration to all of us			2
" her colleagues were concerned that she was working so closely with a doctor in this program , @entity18 remembers			1
they feared the model would become more about nurses being supervised by physicians rather than serving as colleagues and partners			0
there were also a lot of questions about whether state laws would permit what they were teaching : could nurses use devices like stethoscopes ? could they make decisions about the health status of children ? " there was great concern , i think , that the kind of direction that we were taking was much more medical than nursing , " @entity18 said			0
" it 's not easy when you have to buck some of the old prejudices and some of the demands of faculty that 's set in its ways , so to speak			0
" at the same time , professional organizations were calling for nurses to be specialists in clinical areas and more independent in making decisions , but also interdependent in a team relationship with doctors			0
" these are all things the profession was saying , but the rhetoric and reaction were quite different , " @entity18 said			0
" it took a while before there was more acceptance of it in schools of nursing			0
" @entity18 always thought nurse practitioners would be able to practice independently ; it 's only recently that autonomy has been legalized in several states , but there has always been a clear need , she said			1
" a lot of them were doing it anyway			0
now this has legitimized it , " @entity18 said			0
" we were the ' @entity225			0
' we had to make decisions			0
" @entity18 at @entity227 after the success of her program in @entity2 , @entity18 became the founding dean of the @entity232 in 1972			1
by the 1980s , nurse practitioner programs had started cropping up all over the country			1
@entity235 said that when she joined the nursing school faculty at @entity227 in 1985 , a nurse practitioner practicing independently was still unheard of , and there was no national certification			1
@entity235 had done her education at the @entity241 , but the @entity243 area did n't have many nurse practitioners			1
@entity227 , on the other hand , was full of them , thanks in part to @entity18			0
@entity235 , now interim dean of the school of nursing , remembers @entity18 taking the time to interview her when she came to the school			0
the younger woman was anxious , but @entity18 immediately calmed her			0
@entity18 wanted to know what her dreams and passions were			0
" she has a quiet leadership style			0
she is a listener , she is a great thinker and she has the ability to really put you at ease , " @entity235 said			1
" that 's really at the heart of who she is			0
" @entity18 retired about a year later , but has remained involved with the @entity232 through financial support , mentorship , fundraising and other activities			0
the school now has nine specialty nurse practitioner programs , including child psychiatry , which helps fill a need for mental health services in rural upstate @entity29 , @entity235 said			1
but the field seems to be getting broader , so nurse practitioners are trained in more general areas first with the option to specialize , she said			1
nurse practitioners today the four components of @entity18 's vision for nurse practitioners -- the ability to assess , diagnose , treat and evaluate -- have not changed since the early days , but the extent to which they do those things has evolved , and so has their independence , @entity235 said			1
one of those nurse practitioners who operates with that relatively recent independence is @entity290 , who has had her own primary care family practice near @entity292 , @entity293 , for eight years			1
what she does is similar to a family practice physician , but her nursing background has given her an emphasis on " the caring and the curing of health care , " she said			0
about two years after @entity302 became a nurse practitioner , a patient came into her office who confirmed all the reasons she had wanted to go into the field			1
the patient had been struggling with chronic back pain and had seen various health care providers , but could n't find the right combination of therapies that would allow her to resume her work as a jewelry sculptor			0
@entity302 worked with the patient to attack the problem from many angles : pain medicine , physical therapy , acupuncture and meditation			0
the alternative approaches helped the patient feel more in control of her pain , and she did go back to work			0
" when you get to work with a patient to help them find the therapies that are going to let them have the quality of life that they want , i just do n't think it gets any better than that , " said @entity302 , who is also the president - elect of the @entity72			0
@entity335 , 36 , who received her nurse practitioner doctorate degree in may , came into the field because she was frustrated that , as a home care nurse , she 'd have to wait several days -- sometimes even a week -- to get a doctor 's order to request laboratory work or other relatively simple procedures			1
having practiced in multiple nursing specialties and attained this advanced education , @entity335 does n't regret having chosen nursing rather than medical school			1
" i 've had patients tell me things they 've never told anyone in their life			0
it 's really been an honor , " @entity335 said			0
" i 'm sure doctors love being a doctor , too , but i do n't know if they get the full human side of medicine			0
" in fact , a 2010 @entity357 found that @entity35 view nurses as the most honest and ethical professionals , rating them higher than medical doctors and police officers			0
as for @entity18 , who had wanted to go into public school teaching , she 's glad her life took her the way of nursing before giving her teaching opportunities in higher education that have left behind a lasting legacy			1
@entity66 , she said , has enhanced the quality of her and her families ' lives , and given her the privilege of meeting and serving many interesting people			0
" it 's amazing the strength these patients have , and stamina and optimism in the face of some very dire prognoses			0
they 're admirable , " she said			0
" i 've been blessed			0
