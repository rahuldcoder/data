-- now the @entity1 are stepping into the spotlight			2
with the @entity3 packed up from their stormy convention in @entity5 , @entity6 , and back on the campaign trail , the @entity1 gather in @entity8 , @entity9 , to explain to @entity10 why their candidate is a better choice in november			1
like @entity3 , @entity1 must use this high - visibility media opportunity to outline their arguments for the fall			1
although president @entity16 is more of a known commodity than @entity3 candidate @entity20 after three and a half years in the @entity19 , there is still a lot of work for @entity1 to do in the coming days			1
outside of his strong favorability ratings , polls continue to show that @entity16 is extremely vulnerable as a result of the slow economic recovery			2
with so much of the workforce struggling with unemployment and unstable jobs , @entity20 has a fighting chance			2
many @entity10 are unhappy with what the @entity1 have offered			2
they do n't feel that they are better off in 2012 than they were in 2008			0
at their convention , @entity1 need to lay out a series of arguments if they are to strengthen their chances of victory			2
@entity16 's personal popularity is not enough under these conditions			2
democrats must offer a straightforward , ringing defense of what their president has been able to accomplish			0
opinion : can @entity16 convince voters to turn to him again ? with @entity3 talking about failed leadership , @entity1 must seek to show this is not the case			1
too often , @entity1 have been on the defensive , explaining away the shortcomings of @entity16 's legislative legacy or blaming congressional @entity3 for the fate of his initiatives			1
@entity16 has sometimes been reluctant to tell his side of the story , often responding to @entity3 criticism rather than laying out his understanding of what has happened			1
if @entity1 are to do well , the president will have to do more than blame president @entity61 or congressional @entity3 , or just warn about what a @entity20 - @entity62 would do			1
for example , @entity16 could do more to explain how his economic stimulus played an important role in stabilizing economic conditions and investing funds in important programs that will shape the nation 's future			1
in his new book , " @entity74 " , @entity73 correspondent @entity72 argues that the stimulus created over 2 million jobs , prevented a more dire economic collapse , and resulted in billions of dollars being spent on clean energy projects ( with the failure of the solar energy company @entity81 really being atypical ) , information technology projects ( such as rationalizing health care billing ) , education programs , and more			1
@entity16 must also make a stronger case about what his health care bill will achieve -- such as allowing people under 26 to retain health insurance under their parents ' coverage and preventing companies from denying benefits to those with pre-existing conditions			1
he will need to connect his programs to a broader economic strategy , explaining how programs like health care -- which the administration argues will lower overall deficits and lower the cost of premiums for individuals and business -- will be important to a robust economic future			1
in general , @entity10 like government when they are asked about specific policies but do n't like government in the abstract			0
for @entity16 , the lesson is that the more he talks about his record with specifics , the better he will do			2
democrats must also offer a bolder defense of government as a necessity for strong economic growth			0
@entity1 continue to be hesitant and reluctant to mount a defense of government			0
still seeing themselves as living in the @entity123 era , they try to rebut the charge that they are anti-market			0
opinion : young voters , do n't give up on @entity16 in his keynote address to the @entity3 convention , @entity128 gov. @entity127 argued that " our ideas are right for @entity10 and their ideas have failed @entity10			1
" democrats will need to respond			0
recently , @entity16 sloppily tried to explain how governments have been essential to businesses , but said this in a way that opened him up to attack for being anti-business , leading to the @entity3 mantra of " i built this ! " in a fascinating new book entitled " to promote the general welfare : the case for @entity153 , " a group of historians shows how important government has been in almost every area of @entity10 life , from our information networks , to our schools , to our transportation , to our homes			1
in a chapter about housing , the historian @entity154 writes that " federal housing policies remade the whole landscape of @entity10			0
most important , they made possible the rapid expansion of suburbia			0
" without a strong government , private markets ca n't thrive			1
the two go hand in hand			0
the point is not to say that business people are not responsible for their success , but , rather , that the best business people need a strong foundation on which to build their projects			0
one ca n't run a successful store if police do n't protect the shop from thieves , if roads are not built and paved so that customers can reach their destination , if tax incentives are not in place to alleviate some of the costs that the owner must shoulder			1
the last argument that @entity1 , and especially president @entity16 , must make is that he has not given up on his vision of changing the way that politics works			2
when @entity16 ran in 2008 , @entity10 were excited about the possibility of a politician who would transcend the old politics and devote political capital to fixing a broken process			2
but in @entity20 's acceptance speech , the @entity3 candidate asked , " if you felt that excitement when you voted for @entity16 , should n't you feel that way now that he 's president @entity16 ? " @entity16 must respond			1
his promise was not just one of bipartisanship , but a promise to look seriously at the flaws in our political system			0
unfortunately , @entity16 abandoned many of those goals			0
even worse , as a result of both parties walking away from the public finance system that came out of the @entity211 , and a series of court decisions , the 2012 campaign has turned into an orgy of campaign contributors , on both sides of the aisle , funneling millions of dollars into advertising			0
there is so much unregulated money floating around this campaign that it seems likely to produce a major scandal			0
we 're living in a political atmosphere comparable to a film where viewers can clearly see something bad is about to happen , but the characters remain oblivious to what surrounds them			0
while a speech about change wo n't work , because @entity16 now represents the status quo , he and other @entity1 should talk about one or two specific ideas for dealing with the hurricane of money that has hit our political shores			1
@entity241 : to win , @entity16 must make history again even if many @entity10 still do n't like @entity20 , and the tea party @entity3 make it hard for the @entity3 to appeal to the center of the electorate , @entity1 , with this economy , have a million points of vulnerability			1
they need to offer @entity10 something more than the status quo , something more than an alternative to what @entity1 call radical conservatism			0
they need to offer @entity10 policies they can believe in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			0

@entity1 hold their political convention this week in @entity8 , @entity9
@entity257 says it 's vital that @entity1 respond to the charges made by the @entity3
he says @entity16 ca n't rely on blaming @entity61 or warning what a @entity20 @entity19 would do
@entity257 : @entity16 should strongly defend his record , *including* stimulus , health care law
