editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity9 ) -- sloths are fantastically weird animals , the junkies of the jungle who seem to spend their lives either nodding off or scratching and occasionally eating a bean or two before drifting back to what looks like a blissful sleep			1
i 've always been a fan of sloths			0
they 're wonderfully freaky , yet perfectly adapted to their slow arboreal lifestyle			0
their nerves have even evolved to react slower so they do n't flinch at loud noises , making them nature 's most chilled - out animals			0
they have very few natural predators and the only time they 're vulnerable is when they leave the trees once a week and descend to the ground to poo			1
this behavior has befuddled scientists for many years			0
one of the theories is that their solitary lifestyle affords few chances to hook up with the opposite sex and these toilet stops are a good way to meet other sloths			0
see the rest of " sloths ! " at @entity9 but evolution did n't prepare sloths for the power lines and roads that now crisscross @entity20 's jungles			1
the babies of mama sloths who have been run over or zapped by electricity wind up at the @entity70 sanctuary in @entity20			1
it 's the world 's only sloth orphanage , home to more than 100 very sleepy urchins whose lives have been saved by legendary sloth whisperer @entity77			1
if you fall for these animals like i did then you can join the sanctuary 's volunteer program			2
trainee sloth wranglers get to feed the sloths and help exercise and potty train the babies			2
the sanctuary runs on donations and volunteers , so you can do your bit by helping these vulnerable creatures whose jungle home , some say , is being slowly destroyed by pesticides , sold off to @entity100 real estate agencies , and sliced up by roads and power lines .			1

sloths have very few natural predators
@entity20 's roads and power lines *threaten* its sloth *population*
@entity70 is the world 's only sloth sanctuary
