if you 're a person who hates it when your supervisor looks over your shoulder at work , you may want to stop reading this column right now			2
because what follows is only going to depress you			2
@entity9 , the big electronics company based in @entity10 , is manufacturing and selling to corporations a device intended to increase efficiency in the workplace			1
it has a rather bland and generic - sounding name : the @entity16			2
but what it is capable of doing ... well , just imagine being followed around the office or the factory all day by the snoopiest boss in the world			2
and , the thing is , once you hear about it , you just know that , from a management point of view , it is an innovation of absolute genius			2
here 's how it works : the device looks like an employee id badge that most companies issue			1
workers are instructed to wear it in the office			1
embedded inside each badge , according to @entity9 , are " infrared sensors , an accelerometer , a microphone sensor and a wireless communication device			1
" @entity9 says that the badges record and transmit to management " who talks to whom , how often , where and how energetically			2
if you get up to walk around the office a lot , the badge sends information to management about how often you do it , and where you go			2
if you stop to talk with people throughout the day , the badge transmits who you 're talking to ( by reading your co-workers ' badges ) , and for how long			0
do you contribute at meetings , or just sit there ? either way , the badge tells your bosses			0
the stated intention of this is to increase productivity and get the most out of employees			1
but a case can be made that , however much we worry that the @entity69 may be peeking into our lives , we should be just as concerned -- or more -- about the potential for corporations to become their own , private @entity73			1
and there 's not much , in the future , that employees will be able to do about it			0
with government surveillance , the public can complain that the state has no right to be scrutinizing the lives of its citizens so intrusively			0
but corporations can make the argument that supervisors have always been encouraged to keep an eye on how workers are spending their time when they 're on the clock -- and that electronic tools such as the @entity16 are simply a 21st - century way to do that			1
the employers are paying for their workers ' time , the argument will go -- and if the employees do n't like being accountable for how they spend that time , they can always choose to work elsewhere			1
@entity9 says that by analyzing the " enormous amount of data collected with the @entity16 , it will be possible to propose methods to improve organizational communication and quantitatively evaluate efficacy			0
" among the activities the badges record and transmit , according to @entity9 , are " the distance between people talking face - to face " and " an individual 's activity level ( active or nonactive ) , which is determined on the basis of subtle movements detected ( such as talking , nodding and silence )			0
" and the sensor badges never sleep			0
they do n't go to lunch			0
as h. @entity122 , a senior researcher at @entity123 , wrote in the @entity124 , the badges not only transmit who employees are talking to and how long the conversations go on , but can " also measure how well they 're talking to them			0
" if you 're in a conference room with colleagues and they are animated participants in a discussion about , say , sales strategy , while you just remain quiet in your seat , the badge knows it			0
businesses have long dreamed of maximum efficiency , and @entity9 says that , since the business microscope was first developed in its labs in 2007 , " over one million days of human behavior and big data " have been collected			0
( you can imagine the surveillance experts at @entity73 , and at spy agencies for governments around the world , hearing about what @entity9 has come up with , shaking their heads in admiration , and saying : " boy , those guys are good ! " ) the long - term question will be whether companies , in the name of workplace output , will want to risk the morale problems that will inevitably arise among employees who are instructed to wear such devices , manufactured either by @entity9 or by other firms that will engineer their own digital tracking machinery			1
technology always wins , but victory can come with a price			1
and if employees bristle and become resentful about being kept on such a short electronic leash , that could bring about productivity problems of a different sort			1
unhappy workers are not motivated to put in extra effort			1
of course , the employees could get up from their desks , congregate in an out - of - the - way corner of the office , and bitterly complain about it all			0
but the badges would know			0

a device , the @entity181 , is *designed* to track workers in the workplace
@entity185 : this technology allows corporations to become their own , private @entity73
he says while maker of device says this can help increase productivity , what about morale ?
@entity185 : workers are likely to be resentful about being kept on an electronic leash
