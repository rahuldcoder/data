-- in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity4 , @entity2 ceo @entity1 has said the beleaguered bank , which has received $ 45 billion in bailout money from the @entity8 government , is on its way to financial recovery			1
@entity1 : " we 've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time			1
" @entity16 : @entity17 , you 've been named as one of the worst ceos in @entity8			1
there are calls for your resignation from @entity24			1
have you considered stepping down ? vp : i have a job to do and i have n't finished it			2
i 'm going to keep doing the job			2
you know , we 've gone through enormous change at @entity24			2
the management team was brought in during the crisis to clean up what happened with the crisis			2
and , the leadership team , our people have done a wonderful job , we 've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time			1
we have restored financial strength , we have restructured @entity24 , there 's still more work to do but we have a clear strategy , and a clear focus on the future			1
i keep going back to how much we 've accomplished in a very short period of time but really , all the credit goes to our people			1
@entity16 : but there have been such massive investor losses at @entity2 , losses which you did not anticipate			1
should n't you be held ultimately accountable for that ? vp : i came into the job and from day one i 've held myself accountable for restoring @entity24 to its right place			2
i 've held myself accountable for getting @entity24 through this economy , through the crisis that we 're in			2
unfortunately , a lot of us inherited a lot of things			1
the new management team ... came in with a lot of assets particularly focused on the @entity8 consumer			1
and these are losses that we 've had to take but we 've also made a lot of progress			1
we 've cut our cost structure by twenty - five percent , we 've reduced our balance sheet also by about twenty - five percent			2
our riskiest assets have been sold for a lot more than that			1
we 've sold businesses , refocused the company and in the first quarter we did show a modest profit			2
@entity16 : but there 's already word that federal authorities in the @entity8 are putting out their feelers , looking for possible successors to your position			2
do you believe that you still have the full confidence of the @entity8 government , which after all , is now a major shareholder in @entity24 ? vp : you know speculation is only natural when we 've had the kind of losses that you 've talked about and until we 've had sustainable profitability , that does n't make it right			1
the most important part is that this management team and leadership team was brought in to address the issues at @entity24 and our people have done a wonderful job			2
what really counts is the confidence our people , our clients and our regulators around the world , including our primary regulators , have in the leadership of the company ... and the strategy that 's being laid out in order to restore @entity24 to its pre-eminence			1
@entity16 : let 's talk a little about that strategy and for instance , the money for the past year or so that @entity24 has taken -- billions of dollars , tens of billions of dollars in tax payer 's money as a bail out			1
when will that money be given back ? can it ever be repaid ? vp : the government invested $ 45 billion in @entity24			1
it has invested that amount in at least one other bank , it 's invested a lot of money into a lot of banks			1
all due to what happened in the financial markets , @entity136 brothers disappearing , and the lack of confidence that created			2
we , and i 'm sure others are , thankful for the help we received and our goal is very clear , our goal is to repay every dollar as fast as we can with a great rate of return			1
@entity16 : what about the fact the government holds such a high percentage of stock ? do you see that as a long term situation or do you think that sometime in the future , very near , when the government will cease to become the major shareholder ? vp : a lot of extraordinary things have happened in this extraordinary market			1
nobody , nobody believes that we 've gone through something that is normal , by any means			2
the government ownership stake is a result of our converting preferred stock , investment of the government and the common stock			1
the goal is very straightforward , the goal is to manage the company , to sustain profitability , create a rate of return , so that we can repay the government with a great rate of return and thank the taxpayer for the support that we receive			1
@entity16 : as a result of this crisis there have been calls for greater regulation in the financial services industry			2
do you think it is now inevitable ? vp : there is no question this has been an issue for governments through this entire crisis			0
and it is about the fact there was a large shadow banking system in the @entity8 that was mostly not regulated , as an example , although that 's not the only example			0
i do think for capital markets to work well we need good governance and good governance is not always about good regulation			0
good governance goes up and down every organization			0
it 's really about how countries come together to work together , so actually i 'm looking forward to an environment where the governance structure is stronger than the ones we 've gone through			0
@entity16 : is there a fundamental problem with the ethics in this business ? has the pursuit of profit gone too far ? vp : it 's all back to governance is n't it ? and standards are part of governance as well and so when you think about the overall aspects of the government structure for the future , the market architecture for the national system for the future , you 've got to keep coming back			1
you have to take a look at all of it			0
you have to look at it right from the fact that certain central banks did n't think financial stability was part of its mandate all the way through			0
what are the right incentives ? and how do you think about compensating people ? we have to look at all of that -- and we are			0
i must say that we 've weathered the debate that we 've seen			0
we are getting at the answers , but most importantly we are making sure that all the right questions are getting asked			0
@entity16 : so what specific measures would you suggest to try and fix some of these problems that have occurred in the financial industry ? vp : there are a lot of suggestions that have already been made			1
as a matter of fact we were the ones talking about how transparency is important			0
you have to attack market structure correctly , clearing houses , exchanges , have to have level playing fields on capital , accounting around the world			0
it 's important to understand that i 'm happy to have my 136 regulators around the world but we also need one overarching regulator , a systemic regulator that can actually help us and help the system aggregate what 's going on			0
there are suggestions that are not original necessarily			0
we may have been one of the first ones to talk about them but those are generally the sort of answers people are looking at and more importantly i think we need to debate this a little more			0
@entity16 : when will this crisis be over ? do you see any signs , at this point , of a recovery ? vp : what you have to understand is that , this is a significant shock to the world economy			0
just think about it , when you look at the last 5 , 10 years there were two engines of growth			0
there was the @entity8 consumer and credit creation			0
none of those are likely to be the engines of growth going forward			0
the world 's looking for a new business model			0
it 's about new engines of growth and it 's not only about creating stability and saying that we 're out of the crisis mode			0
but we all have work to do as we search for what the new business model is for the world			0
i am optimistic about the signs that we 're seeing , suggesting that stability is arriving			0
we still have more to look at , to see that it 's here for sure , but i 'm optimistic that we might start seeing stability in the financial markets , which i think is good , but that 's stage one			0
stage two is about what kind of world we want to have going forward , what 's the new business model ? and that 's what we 're really focused on at @entity24			1
we are a global bank , and by the way , we have a very significant merging business heritage			1
two things i 'm sure of : the merging markets growth and globalization of trade and finance			0
we 're squarely positioned against both of those			0
we 've taken the harder steps ... a lot of the world needs to do the same .			1
