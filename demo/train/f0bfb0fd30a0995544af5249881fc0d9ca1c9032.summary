@entity0 is knocking at your front door			1
it wants to come inside , make itself at home , and quietly turn all of your boring home devices into " smart " connected gadgets that learn about your patterns and preferences , talk to each other , collect data about your habits and make life easier by assisting with daily tasks			1
on monday , @entity0 announced it was buying smart - device company @entity15 for $ 3.2 billion in cash			1
this is @entity0 's first major foray into connected homes , and news of the deal ignited a flurry of speculation about what the @entity24 giant really wants from @entity15 , as well as some privacy concerns			1
nest currently only sells two products : a smart thermostat that learns your habits over time and adjusts the temperature accordingly , and a personable smoke and carbon monoxide detector that does n't panic when you burn toast			1
while the devices have been popular , on the surface they do n't seem like they move enough units to be worth such a hefty investment , even at $ 130 to $ 250 each			0
it 's what 's behind the scenes and inside the gadgets that makes nest a coveted get for @entity0			1
nest makes impeccably designed hardware powered by clever algorithms			2
its staff comes from major companies like @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 and is experienced in machine learning , product design , artificial intelligence and robotics			0
nest is a standout in the increasingly crowded connected - home market			1
it may only have two products , but those devices are considered some of the best in the field			0
for now , @entity15 is expected to continue operating as its own brand headed by co-founders @entity69 and @entity70 , but down the line @entity0 could tap the team 's expertise to help with its own hit - and - miss attempts at creating and selling devices ( remember the @entity76 ? )			1
the @entity15 uses motion , light , temperature and humidity sensors to collect information about what 's going on in the home and uses that information to control heating and cooling and predict patterns			2
the end result is a customized , more energy efficient home			0
like any good smart device , it can be controlled from a smartphone or tablet so your house can be prewarmed before you get out of bed or return from work			2
" it 's amazing to see how they have taken important but unloved devices and made them beautifully simple and useful , " said @entity0 ceo @entity99 in a brief post announcing the deal			1
aside from the financial windfall , there 's a lot @entity15 could gain from having @entity0 as its parent company			1
nest has been slow with product releases so far			0
the first thermostat came out in the fall of 2011 , and the company did n't release a new product for another two years , when it announced the @entity15 smoke and @entity118 detector			2
with @entity0 resources , @entity15 can ramp up its design process and develop more projects			2
new products will come faster and roll out in more locations globally			0
@entity0 also wants to be a player in the connected home			1
the trend of connecting previously " dumb " devices to each other and the @entity129 is sometimes referred to as the " internet of things			0
" as regular objects get connected , they gain the ability to collect information about mundane happenings around them			0
that data can be used to learn about a person over time and offer a customized , automated experience			0
at home , that can mean a refrigerator that knows what food is inside and when it expires , or security systems that send your smartphone a push notification when they detect anything unusual			0
@entity0 has cultivated a diverse and seemingly random set of interests since starting out as a search engine and advertising company			1
it dabbles in e-mail , smartphones , self - driving cars , social networking , smart glasses , television and robots			1
nest is the latest in a string of intriguing acquisitions , following a handful of robotics companies			0
in the near future , these interests may not seem so disconnected			0
today 's emerging technologies will eventually blend together			0
the divisions between smartphones , home automation , cars , smart glasses and watches and fitness trackers will fall away , and our gadgets and data will work together for a seamless experience			1
all of your devices will communicate with each other			0
where one drops off another will pick up			0
your self - driving car will share push notifications from your smartphone , turn it over to your @entity190 when you park and start walking , and then a smart home can take over when you walk through your front door			1
( thanks to @entity195 on your phone and car , the house knew exactly when you were arriving and turned on your favorite tv show			0
) streams of data from all these devices will be collected in one place where a company like @entity0 will analyze it and learn about you over time , programming hardware and software to meet your unique needs			1
a few years from now , you might even connect your smart devices to your brain			0
@entity210 , a professor of electrical and computer engineering at @entity211 and a senior member of @entity213 , is working on miniaturizing single electrode devices that can be placed in your hair and read electrical activity from the brain through a technology called electroencephalography , or @entity220			0
" it can read the brainwaves which determine the state of our minds , like whether we 're healthy or unhealthy			0
a lot of information can be obtained [ from @entity220 ] , " @entity210 said			0
he says in the future , smart homes will pick up on cues from the body and brain to adjust things like temperature			1
it if detects you 're in a deep @entity237 sleep , a home might increase the level of security			0
the technology would n't be limited to smart homes and could expand to include personal heath care systems			1
if this is the future , it 's no mystery why @entity0 would want to get into the business now			1
@entity0 owning another tool that would allow it to gather more data immediately triggered privacy concerns			2
fresh off of an unpopular decision to allow @entity251 contacts to contact people in their circles through @entity254 , @entity0 already has users who are unsettled by the vast amounts of data the company can collect			1
@entity0 has access to a person 's data through the @entity262 , @entity254 accounts , @entity0 search terms and the many advanced sensors on an @entity267 smartphone			1
that wide reach is actually a good reason not to worry about a smart thermostat			2
@entity0 can collect most of the same information through an @entity267 phone			2
it already knows your location and your daily schedule			0
@entity278 's @entity277 @entity267 smartphone even has a built - in temperature sensor			2
@entity0 has access to much of your data			2
now it wants to put it to use connecting your home , work and mobile life .			2

@entity0 is purchasing smart - thermostat company nest for $ 3.2 billion in cash
this is @entity0 's first major entry into the connected home market
smart homes , phones , cars and glasses could all work together for a @entity0 - powered life
