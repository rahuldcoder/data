imagine this : you 've toiled at a company for years and followed all the rules			0
you 're productive , diligent , and respected by your peers			0
in short , you 're a model employee			0
but the latest round of raises that have consumed the office leave you thinking that your male colleagues -- despite having the same job title -- make more than you			0
you begin to suspect you 're the victim of gender discrimination			1
so , you decide it 's time to " lean in " and secure the equal pay you deserve -- 77 cents on the dollar , the nation 's going rate , just wo n't cut it			1
but when you take this information to your boss you 're told that the company 's pay practices are secret and you can be fired for discussing them			1
throughout @entity22 , countless women find themselves between a rock and a hard place			1
they suspect they 're being denied equal pay , but have no way of confirming it			1
or worse , they do n't know they 're being shortchanged because company policies prevent them from discussing their wages			1
the @entity33 was passed to prohibit wage discrimination on the basis of sex and sought to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work			1
its purpose was clear : eliminate the gender wage gap , which hurts women and families			1
but 50 years later , pay discrimination is alive and well			1
gag rules that require employees to keep their pay secret perpetuate this inequity			1
it 's time for our wages to get out from behind the secrecy paywall			2
a majority of private sector workplaces in @entity22 prohibit or discourage employees from discussing their wages with co-workers			1
as a result , employees who mention what they earn are threatened with retaliation , including harassment , demotion , or termination			2
women who believe they 're the victims of unequal pay face an impossible choice : jeopardize their economic livelihood or suffer the indignity and economic consequences of discrimination			1
low - wage women workers -- many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and are seen as replaceable by their employers -- are especially likely to choose silence and live with pay discrimination rather than risk their jobs			1
still others will have no clue that they are being paid less			0
pay secrecy policies can keep women in the dark for years			1
take @entity86 , who worked as a supervisor at a @entity89 plant in @entity90 , @entity91 , for nearly two decades without knowing that she had been denied equal pay			0
had it not been for an anonymous note , she would never have learned that she was earning substantially less than her male colleagues			0
pay secrecy facilitated @entity89 's discrimination			1
the @entity98 , meanwhile , has exacerbated the problem			0
for decades , plaintiffs were typically afforded discovery , the opportunity to secure testimony and documents from their employer , before resolution of their claims			0
but in two deeply divided decisions , the @entity98 recently abandoned that practice and now requires plaintiffs to provide more detailed information about the alleged discrimination before discovery			0
this higher burden is nearly insurmountable for women alleging unequal pay			2
because of pay secrecy , their complaints often begin with a strong hunch that can only be verified through corporate records and sworn statements			0
denying them access to this basic information is tantamount to locking them out of the courthouse			0
unsurprisingly , workplaces that have abandoned punitive pay secrecy , like the federal government and many unionized workplaces , have been particularly effective in reducing the gender wage gap			2
female federal workers are paid 89 cents , and unionized female workers 88 cents , for every dollar paid to men			1
economists have posited that more transparent workplaces will lead to greater worker satisfaction and productivity , while closed pay practices will lead to lower motivation and mistrust of management			1
permitting workers to discuss their wages would also make managers more accountable			2
the @entity148 , reintroduced in @entity149 , would prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss their wages			1
the legislation has been blocked , but if passed , would finally close loopholes in the @entity33			0
it would permit workers to compare notes and determine whether they 're being paid fairly , without fear of retribution			2
if the legislation continues to stall , president @entity159 can and should act			0
he can sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to abandon punitive pay secrecy and protect nearly 22 % of the @entity22 workforce			0
those refusing to comply would lose the government as a client			0
and let 's not let states off the hook			0
state laws can provide important protections against employer retaliation			1
in august , @entity175 gov. @entity174 signed a law banning retaliation against workers who inquire about salary			2
@entity175 joins states like @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 in outlining explicit protections for workers seeking equal pay			2
justice @entity188 famously said the best remedy for social and industrial disease was publicity and sunlight its most effective disinfectant			0
fifty years after the @entity33 , pay secrecy still masks discrimination			2
there is only one way to fight this darkness : light			0
join us @entity201 / @entity200 .			0

many companies have secret pay practices : discussing wages a firable *offense*
they say women who think they are paid less than men ca n't find out ; some never suspect
*writers* : low - wage women workers most likely keep quiet , live with pay discrimination
they back @entity148 , which would ban employer retaliation for discussing pay
