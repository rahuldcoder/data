@entity0 , @entity1 -- at nearly $ 12.1 trillion , the @entity4 national debt has reached a size that is incomprehensible to most people and as intangible as the ' " @entity8 " or bipartisanship			1
but it is real in @entity1 , where a small , nearly anonymous group of government accountants calculate the public debt to the penny each day , living a mathematic nightmare and number cruncher 's dream			1
at a large desk in @entity0 , @entity18 watches over roughly 6,500 pieces of data and trillions of dollars each day			1
her title takes up a few characters itself : @entity18 is the debt accounting branch manager for the @entity28			1
she and a division of just 15 people quietly and relentlessly work to account for every penny of the national debt			1
it is tedious and potentially overwhelming work , but @entity36 acts as if she flies jet fighters			0
" i get very excited , " the petite and energetic @entity18 says , " they call me a nerd , several times ; i think it 's because i get very excited about all the work we do			1
" that work happens in a simple one - story , brick building in @entity0 , some 300 miles from @entity47			2
the public debt offices landed there thanks to heavyweight home - state sen. @entity50			1
the bureau 's offices are tucked into a corner of town that 's easy to miss. a brown hill and train track sit on one side , parking lots for county offices on the other			0
the locale is still a surprise to some			0
" every now and then we get a comment , ' where are you ? @entity0 ? ' " @entity18 says			1
the public debt building has become a number nerds ' paradise			1
employees say they balance their checkbooks at least weekly , some daily			0
a big happy - face sign marks progress on a recent audit			0
a written goal is taped to a @entity79 - sized football			0
and the security guards brag that someone brings in a cake about every other day			2
inside , @entity18 's office is pin - neat , but her computer screen is cramped			1
a full - screen photo of @entity86 's 4 - and 5 - year - old children is covered by dozens of icons for spreadsheets and documents , so that glimpses of bright blonde hair poke out from under a field of white data squares			0
" i need to clean it out right now , " @entity18 says with a shrug , then laughs			1
she then calls up the brain of the debt - management system , a software program called @entity101 , or public debt accounting and @entity103			1
the acronym is a pun only an accountant would love			0
" par value " means " stated value " in the field			0
@entity101 is a custom program , designed in the early ' 90s to check and double - check the constant buying and selling of @entity4 debt			1
thanks in part to the debt software , what used to take 100 people a month to compute now is done by 15 people in a day			1
even so , the program looks like it 's from another time , with a black screen and neon - colored letters that recall computer monitors of the " @entity124 " era			2
" it is outdated , " @entity18 says of the font			1
but she insists the program itself still operates well			2
annual government reviews of @entity101 back that up			0
and the division overall has a remarkable record of 13 straight years of unqualified audits , the accounting gold standard of accuracy			2
that brings a massive smile to @entity18 's face ; you see how someone so enthusiastic can be called a nerd			2
" things like that make me very excited			0
" ( her favorite report , by the way , is the " schedules of public debt "			1
) each day , to check the funds flowing in and out of the public debt , @entity36 types in five - digit codes into @entity101 and checks a slew of accounts			1
she knows about 50 of those codes by heart			0
in general , there is a scale to this work that would disrupt most minds			0
" most people do n't have a sense of it until they come here and see it , " said accounting director @entity163 , who is @entity18 's boss			1
" most calculators do n't handle what we do			1
" and almost no one sees the debt as they do			0
" a lot of people , i do n't think realize what the debt 's made of , " @entity18 put forth			1
" in that $ 12 trillion you have both debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings			2
" in other words , the debt held by those outside the government and debt the government owes to itself , such as money borrowed from the @entity187			0
at the end of november , $ 7.7 trillion was debt held by the public and $ 4.4 trillion was intragovernmental holdings			2
@entity18 sees a heartbeat in the numbers			2
" it 's actually helping us operate government			0
" and never has government been larger			0
but @entity18 and these accountants of the people are careful on that note			1
" it 's not that we 're saying this is the right thing to do , " she states matter - of - factly			0
" a lot of times we 're saying , ' if they pass this , how are we going to account for it ? ' a lot of times that takes a lot of meetings			0
" @entity18 is right , in the age of deficits and debt , all of that literally keeps government operating			1
yet those trillions of dollars are overseen by a small division that works without contractors and is content with a software system that may look clunky , but which they insist works more than well			2
there is an irony here			0
these self - proclaimed nerds oversee the very symbol of big government but exude sobriety and restraint			0
@entity18 and her staff are nearly anonymous but deeply significant			2
and they are more than happy that way .			0

in @entity1 , a small group of accountants calculate the public debt to the penny each day
" most calculators do n't handle what we do , " accounting director says
the program accountants use is outdated , but works well , @entity18 says
the public debt building has become a number nerds ' paradise
