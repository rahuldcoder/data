-- is the @entity2 prostitution scandal rocking the @entity3 an isolated incident ? or is it evidence of a debauched organizational culture that permeates the entire agency when its agents are out of the country and do n't think anyone is watching ? this is the question that has been on everyone 's mind as word leaked out last week about a similar incident involving the @entity3 and some military personnel in @entity18 before president @entity20 's trip there in march			1
on thursday , an unnamed source told the @entity22 that such behavior was part of the @entity3 culture			1
the implications are serious indeed			2
paying prostitutes for sex is , of course , sordid , immoral and pretty embarrassing in and of itself			0
however , if in fact the men in the agency charged with protecting the president and other important government officials when they are abroad have a history of cavorting with prostitutes -- in a culture that says it 's ok -- the problem goes way beyond embarrassment			1
this whole business may be news to the @entity45 public , but if it is really part of the culture it is n't news to those who wish us harm			2
in the decade since the september 11 attacks , we have come to understand that the shady world of terror is inextricably bound up with the shady world of illegal activity			0
how many " prostitutes " are also foreign agents or terrorist operatives ? how many others are simply willing to make money , first by selling themselves and then by selling whatever they find in the bedrooms of @entity45 government personnel to someone who is up to no good ? this is not a problem that can be solved by the passage of new laws or by moving the boxes around on an organization chart			2
even the swift action taken to remove the offenders from their jobs , and to revoke the security clearances of others will not offer much of a deterrent once memories of the scandal fade and some new outrage surfaces to dominate the news			2
ordinarily , changing an organization 's culture is pretty hard work			1
but when the culture in need of change is a macho culture where good old - fashioned debauchery and " boys being boys " is ok as long as no one gets caught -- the solution is pretty straightforward : hire more women			1
is n't it funny how having to work alongside a woman who , for instance , knows your wife -- seems to inhibit old fashioned male fun ? we 've seen this before			0
tales from the 1960 presidential campaign plane can be summarized by the motto : " wheels up , rings off ! " ( as in wedding rings			0
) from the candidate on down , the inhabitants of the hard - drinking , virtually all - male world of politicians , and the reporters who wrote about them , covered for each other and kept things private for years			0
today 's campaign plane has been cleaned up a lot -- from the candidates to the reporters -- and the most important reason is that there are now a fair number of women on the plane , as both advisers with real power and reporters with real power			1
can you imagine the kind of debauchery that was standard operating procedure 50 years ago being tolerated by @entity128 , the influential , longtime aide to @entity129 who has the important job of heading his vice presidential search ? years ago the only women around were young women with no power			1
they were often the victims of a bad culture			2
today there are middle - aged women with real power			0
they are not victims of the all male culture -- they change it			0
i know this has happened in politics , i saw it myself coming into the business at the end of the old era			0
and i suspect it has happened in other professions , as well			0
do advertising executives still woo clients with multiple martinis and high - class call girls , a la " @entity154 " ? maybe			0
but i suspect the presence of lot of powerful women in that business has reduced the overall level of debauchery			1
if there does turn out to be a culture of debauchery in the @entity3 , it will not come as a surprise			1
after all , the " protection professions , " if you will -- @entity3 , police , military -- are among the last professions to be overwhelmingly male			1
and yet , as we 've seen in the military , when technology takes over from muscle , women start to do the same things as men			0
in the workplace they begin to go where only men used to go			0
and outside of the workplace ? well , it 's hard to imagine an organization where the women head out to a brothel together			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : *allegations* of debauchery in @entity3 have serious implications
she says terrorists could easily know if that 's the case and exploit agents ' *vulnerabilities*
she says changing culture by adding more women could help
@entity185 : presence of women in powerful jobs has pushed back at macho *misbehavior*
