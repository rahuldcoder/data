-- sometimes , i suppose , even celebrities need a few extra bucks			2
maybe they want to buy a new @entity4 or a house in the south of @entity7 or add a bowling alley to the basement of their mansion ? whatever their motive , many turn to advertising when singing , acting or modeling gigs start to dry up			2
usually , they just stand around and talk about the product and the commercial is n't too much of a stretch			0
but some celebrity endorsements have left us scratching our heads			0
take @entity22 who , this summer , is teaming up with @entity23 for their new " paparazzi " line			1
we are n't really sure what burlesque and paparazzi have to do with sparkling water but , hey , it 'll probably work			1
here are nine more star hucksters peddling strange wares			0
the @entity0 : 10 hottest @entity33 moms over 40 @entity34 is so pc now in " @entity36 , " columnist @entity34 does all of her writing on a @entity38 she 's been shown typing away on it for many , many years -- through all the seasons and the first movie			1
but in " @entity42 , " @entity41 will be using an @entity43 because of a partnership with @entity43			1
she 'll also be showing up in some of their television commercials , print ads , outdoor ads and online ads. some of the other characters in the movie will be representing the product , too			0
and they think die - hard fans wo n't notice the switch ? the @entity0 : i sabotaged my relationship to have drinks with my ex king of darkness ' soft spot for butter @entity62 did a spot for ... butter			1
well , actually , it was for " @entity66 , " which is a combination of chemicals meant to resemble butter			0
still , who 'd have guessed this old rock star would be doing food ads ? perhaps they paid him in alcohol ? at least they did n't have him spread the stuff on a bat			1
punk icon turned insurance salesman @entity80 showed up in a commercial for @entity82 , which is some kind of insurance for your insurance			0
that 's pretty strange in and of itself but the ad featured @entity80 dancing , twitching and sweating while standing topless in front of a purple screen and saying weird things through a clenched , wrinkly jaw			1
this is a good way not to sell a product			0
the @entity0 : 14 examples of the worst facial hair in @entity100 @entity101 in april , @entity103 teamed up with @entity101 , designing a new and very pretentious - looking @entity105 " light " bottle , to be sold at $ 5 a pop. not surprisingly , it is a chic combo of black , white and pink and has a picture of @entity103 on it			1
die - hard fans can purchase the $ 80 boxed set at the exclusive @entity114 boutique in @entity115 , which comes with one bottle of @entity103 's @entity117 , " a display box , and a bottle opener			1
or , you @entity101 fans just buy a regular bottle of @entity105 for $ .99 ? water does her hot body good we all know hot models and celebs move products off shelves , but now even bottled water companies are using super hot stars to push their products			0
recently , @entity134 teamed up with @entity135 and their new ad shows the 41 - year - old actress posing with rock - hard abs and a big bottle of the pricey water			1
the ads call @entity146 's " workout partner , " but , let 's face it : it 's just water , which is basically everyone 's workout partner			1
twilight star 's titillating print ad @entity150 , who played @entity151 in " @entity152 , " also did a weird stint for advertising all in the name of " healthy " water			1
she wore a painted - on swimsuit ( and nothing else but paint ) that made her look like she was covered in scales for @entity160 , a calorie - free drink that 's sort of like water , but it 's not			1
@entity163 eats peas for cash in one of the weirdest duos i 've seen in a long time , @entity163 paired up with @entity171 tv star @entity170 to do a spot for @entity171 's @entity173			2
i was too busy watching @entity175 and @entity170 converse and stuff peas and potatoes in their faces to figure out what the commercial was actually for			0
it certainly does n't help that the dialogue in it is incredibly difficult to understand			0
the @entity0 : how celebrities get in shape for summer @entity187 sold cigarettes about 40 years ago , @entity187 was pushing @entity189			2
the commercial shows @entity187 going into a cave to buy some cigs			2
then , he gets into a conversation with the shop owner about how awesome @entity195 are			0
he proudly claims he 'll never smoke anything else			0
that is , until scientists found out cigarettes cause cancer and he switched to hawking kids ' vitamins and mac n ' cheese shapes			0
@entity206 's political pizza spot although former @entity209 leader @entity206 is n't technically a celebrity , his commercial for @entity208 in 1997 was just too weird not to mention here			2
the ad , which is subtitled , features @entity206 chowing down in a very rustic - looking pizza restaurant while people praise his political prowess			1
the whole thing was meant to promote @entity208 's " the edge " pizza , which had toppings that went all the way to the edge of the crust			2
huh ? @entity223 all rights reserved			0

@entity22 is teaming up with @entity23 for their new " paparazzi " line this summer
@entity41 ( @entity229 ) will be using an @entity43 because of a partnership with @entity43
@entity134 's ad for @entity135 shows the *acress* posing with rock - hard abs
