zine el abidine @entity0 will be remembered as the first leader to be toppled in what became known as the @entity3			1
after nearly 24 years in power , he became the former president of @entity6			2
just over a year ago a young fruit seller in the city of @entity9 took the desperate step of setting himself on fire to protest the oppressive conditions inside his country			2
despite a hospital visit by the then president , coupled with vows to cut prices of basic foods , end censorship and ensure police did not use live ammunition on protesters , @entity0 failed to quell growing unrest			1
@entity26 succumbed to his injuries and his death triggered uprisings across @entity6 that spread through the @entity31 world , leading to regime change in @entity33 and @entity34			2
nearly 250 people died during the @entity6 violence that led to @entity0 's ouster			1
the 75 - year - old fled with his wife @entity39 to @entity40 , and attempts to return him for trial have so far proved fruitless			0
other family members were reported to be in @entity44			0
@entity0 is facing a military tribunal in absentia , along with dozens of former senior officials , for his alleged role in the killing of protesters in january 2011			1
the former president and his wife already have been tried in absentia and sentenced to 35 years in prison for corruption			2
although he has not appeared in court to defend himself , @entity0 insists he is merely a " scapegoat , " unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country 's past			1
in a statement released by his lawyer last june he said he was a victim of " injustice " and that he had always worked for what he thought was " the good of the @entity6 people , improving living standards and progressing on the path to modernity			1
" but the @entity6 people chose a different path after more than two decades under single - party rule			0
the @entity73 and @entity74 - educated @entity0 trained as a soldier and later became head of the defense ministry 's intelligence section -- a connection that analysts believe helped him maintain a grip on power during his presidency			1
after serving as ambassador to @entity85 and ashort - lived appointment as prime minister , he became president in a 1987 bloodless coup , replacing @entity90 , who was declared medically unfit			0
@entity0 was returned to office in five elections -- in 1989 , 1994 , 1999 , 2004 and 2009 -- often with claims of more than 90 % voter support			2
however , his years in power were marked by allegations of corruption and repression			0
shortly after @entity0 's overthrow , @entity6 @entity99 told @entity101 : " you did n't want to be overheard saying something against @entity0			1
fear left with @entity0 , may he and that fear never come back			2
" dr @entity106 , who heads the @entity107 and @entity108 at @entity110 - based think - tank @entity109 , said the former president used his intelligence background to clamp down on the freedom of speech			1
" it was more of a police state , " she said			0
" there was a great atmosphere of distrust			0
" liberalization of the economy started as a good idea but it deviated from benefiting the rest of the population			0
his inner circle was top slicing any company that was making a profit			0
" such corruption and high unemployment are two factors that are thought to have pushed @entity26 to self - immolation			0
dr @entity132 believes that in the end , @entity0 became a victim of his own political blindness			1
" he looked like someone who believed his own myth and to be out of touch with what was happening in @entity6			0
