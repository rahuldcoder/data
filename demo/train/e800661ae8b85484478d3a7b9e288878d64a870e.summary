for the first time in human history , more than half the world 's population is living in cities , which now produce approximately 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions			2
that puts cities on the frontlines of the battle against climate change -- and more and more cities are leading the charge			2
in @entity15 , we began a frontal attack on climate change in 2007 with the release of our sustainability blueprint , @entity20 -- and since then we 've made major progress			1
for instance , we are well on our way to meeting our goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030			0
for coastal cities like @entity15 , the risks of climate change are especially serious : sea levels are expected to rise by another two and a half feet in the next 40 years , making storm surges even more powerful and dangerous			1
and intense storms are likely to increase as the ocean 's temperatures continue to rise			0
but it 's not just storms			0
droughts and heat waves may be longer and more intense for urban populations everywhere in the years to come			0
around the world , city leaders are not wasting time debating the science of climate change or waiting around for international treaties to be signed ; we are taking action			1
there 's simply too much to do and too much at stake			0
for the past two years , i have been chairman of the @entity48 , which includes some of the biggest and most innovative cities in the world			1
thanks to @entity48 's research , we know that @entity48 have taken more than 4,700 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the possible effects of climate change			1
in fact , @entity48 has the potential to reduce emissions by more than one billion tons a year by 2030 â€” which is equivalent to making both @entity61 and @entity62 entirely carbon - neutral			1
in @entity15 , our actions to reduce our carbon footprint include planting more than a half - million new trees ; banning the use of the most polluting forms of heating oil ; and launching a major bike sharing initiative			1
the strict codes we 've adopted for energy - efficiency in major commercial and residential buildings have the potential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least five percent and save @entity15 more than $ 750 million per year in energy costs			1
but our work to make our city more energy efficient is only half the battle			0
last fall , @entity80 made all too clear how vitally important it is to build stronger and more sustainable infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events			1
that 's why in june , we launched a long - term plan specifically focused on protecting our city from the effects of climate change.e for instance , we 're working to strengthen dune systems and beaches across the city			1
our plan includes surge barriers to prevent flooding and a strong network of bulkheads , floodwalls , levies , and other protections in vulnerable places along the waterfront			0
we are working with private companies and regulators to strengthen critical infrastructure against severe weather -- including our power , telecommunications , and transportation systems			0
and we 're also raising construction standards to ensure new buildings can withstand extreme weather			0
in developing this plan , we looked around the world to identify best practices and innovative new solutions -- and that 's the power of the @entity48 network			2
it creates a forum for cities to share best practices and resources -- and even to collaborate with other cities and institutions			0
for instance , @entity48 has now formed partnerships with the @entity127 and other international organizations that have expertise and resources , which are helping cities take bolder actions more quickly			2
in addition , @entity48 has focused on the research and data collection necessary to assess our progress , because i firmly believe in the maxim : if you ca n't measure it , you ca n't manage it			2
mayors are pragmatists , not partisans ; innovators , not ideologues			0
we are responsible for delivering results , not debating politics			0
and as the world becomes increasingly more urban , the importance of bold local action -- particularly on climate change -- will continue to grow .			1

@entity15 mayor @entity151 is chairman of @entity48
city leaders are taking action , not debating climate science , says mayor
@entity80 *emphasized* importance of stronger infrastructure
@entity15 is *prepping* for future storms and cutting emissions
