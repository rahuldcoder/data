-- wednesday in @entity1 will see two worlds collide , when @entity3 take on @entity4 - r. @entity5 welcome @entity6 to the @entity7 for a @entity9 quarterfinal first leg , with both teams vying for a spot in the final four of @entity13 's @entity12			1
the @entity15 - funded , mega-rich , ultra-trendy club very much on the rise , against the team that made it fashionable to buy - your - way - to - success , backed by @entity22 's rubles			1
the @entity24 oligarch arrived in west @entity25 in 2003 and within two years , had helped -- or perhaps been solely responsible -- for ending @entity6 's 50 - year wait for an @entity28 league title			1
seven years later , his dream of landing the continent 's premier club trophy was finally realized when the @entity32 lifted the 2012 @entity9			1
for @entity33 , you need look no further than across the @entity34			2
2011 saw @entity36 take control of @entity5 , and just like at @entity38 , the national championship arrived two years later after many millions of dollar had been spent			1
@entity9 glory is next on the agenda and it is very possible that it will have turned up in the same nine - year period it took @entity6 to achieve it following massive investment			1
but perhaps the similarities stop there			2
some are inclined to feel that @entity5 are favorites to progress past @entity6 into the semifinals because of one player : @entity51			1
the striker has been on a one - man scoring rampage , blasting his way past anything that dares try and stop him			2
@entity58 aside -- you will struggle to find many who have bettered his stunning tally of 39 goals from 42 games for club and country this season			2
he also has @entity9 pedigree coming into wednesday 's game , with the @entity69 pouncing 10 times in his last seven appearances in the competition			1
@entity6 's problems up front this season , however , have been well - documented , with coach @entity75 recently admitting that there will be great changes in that department come the summer			1
until then , he is stuck with an $ 80 million player who once would have come close to matching @entity51 's goalscoring feats			0
sadly for @entity75 , that player , @entity75 , seems to be stuck in a parallel universe -- somewhere on @entity82 , circa 2009 , to be precise , when he was in the form of his life for @entity85			0
and unfortunately , if @entity75 ' nine goals from 32 appearances this term are insufficient , the @entity6 boss will be unable to call on a @entity9 winning - striker in his ranks			1
@entity92 is out of the game due to injury , yet questioning his age suggests the @entity96 does not fill @entity75 with too much confidence anyway			0
@entity6 do have another @entity9 winner to call upon on wednesday or , better put , a double @entity9 winner -- in @entity75 himself			1
the @entity102 , who won the title with @entity105 in 2004 and @entity106 in 2010 , was made for nights like this , and put him in a one - off game , or a two - legged tie in this case , and not too many will come out on top against him			0
while his opposite number , @entity116 , may have the better manners and does not go around poking opponents in the eye , he can not match @entity75 's invaluable big - game experience			2
in fact , he has never made it past this stage in the competition			0
on the home front , @entity116 and @entity5 may have all but tied up the @entity128 @entity127 title , boasting a 13 - point advantage over second - placed @entity130 with seven games left			1
but that has to be the bare minimum for a club with ambitions of their size playing in a league not renowned for its stature , nor one that can match the @entity142 's uber - competitiveness			2
manners were mentioned earlier , and this is perhaps a key theme that runs through the heart of the two clubs ' differing identities			0
while @entity75 spent his weekend lecturing a @entity150 ball boy , @entity116 could be found lavishing high praise on the @entity102			0
move away from the managers and take a quick glance at their respective captains , and you 'll see that pattern continue			0
@entity157 is the sophisticated leader to @entity159 's rough diamond ; one plays the game in an honest way with an irremovable smile on his face , while the other has often stretched the boundaries of decency over the years			0
the same can be said of the differing atmospheres inside the clubs ' two stadiums , although that is perhaps a comment on @entity173 and @entity128 football cultures in general			0
the @entity7 is an altogether more sober affair , a place where fans mix with @entity128 fashion icons and movie stars			2
@entity38 , meanwhile , is a setting where supporters like to chuck celery onto the field of play , conjuring up memories of the stadium 's infamous " @entity38 " in the less - than - glorious era of 1980s @entity173 football			0
@entity38 is a little further than a stone 's throw away from the @entity191 , while the @entity7 is a short walk from the @entity193			0
a pasty or pie is likely to be the match snack for many a @entity6 fan , while @entity5 supporters may prefer to tuck into something a tad more upmarket , given @entity128 's long established gastronomic reputation			1
differing clubs , but both with money -- lots of it -- at their core			0
it all adds up to what should be a fascinating encounter .			0
