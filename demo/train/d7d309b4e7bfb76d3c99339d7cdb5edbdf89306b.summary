@entity0 was arrested , again , this month in the suspected aggravated assault of a girlfriend			1
and , again , a @entity5 prosecutor has opted not to press formal charges -- after the alleged victim backed off her claims			2
state attorney @entity9 , whose jurisdiction includes @entity12 and @entity13 counties , announced friday that his office wo n't file charges against @entity0 , who first came to the world 's attention for his arrest and eventual acquittal in the 2012 shooting death of @entity22 teenager @entity21			1
friday 's announcement relates to the 31 - year - old 's arrest in @entity26 , @entity5 , on january 9			2
" while it clear that the officers had probable cause to arrest mr. @entity0 , which was affirmed by the circuit court judge at initial appearances , the subsequent recantation by the ( alleged ) victim of her initial statement along with new documents provided by the victim and her attorney precludes my office from proceeding further , " @entity9 said			2
@entity0 attorney @entity41 had told reporters that his client was accused of throwing a wine bottle at a girlfriend			1
police learned about it days later after coming " in contact with the ( alleged ) victim at a traffic stop , " @entity26 police spokeswoman @entity46 said			0
the woman has since denied that @entity0 threw a bottle or that she ever feared him , according to a statement friday from @entity26 police			1
" she also made it clear that she did not want to proceed with the case , " said police , noting that @entity26 police chief @entity57 " concurred with @entity9 's decision			0
" " a lack of eyewitnesses or other corroborating evidence to dispute her version of the incident also contributed to the decision			0
" this is the latest instance since july 2013 -- when a jury found him not guilty of murder in @entity21 's death -- that @entity0 has had a run - in with the law , only to have authorities decide not to push for a trial			1
about two weeks after the verdict , he was pulled over for speeding in northern @entity77			0
much bigger troubles came in november 2013 , when @entity0 was taken into custody at his then - girlfriend 's @entity81 , @entity5 , home after the two allegedly had a heated fight			1
he was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief , accusations , posting $ 9,000 bail days later			2
but after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped , @entity90 announced that prosecutors would not press charges			0
@entity95 has said the woman in the more recent instance " is not the same ( woman ) as in 2013			0
" also , in september 2014 , @entity26 police said that a man claimed @entity0 threatened him during a road rage incident saying " i will ... kill you , " and " do you know who i am ? " he was not arrested and has not been charged			2
talking about the aggravated assault cases , @entity41 said earlier this month of his client : " it 's clear he has n't been very lucky with the ladies the last few months			1
" the lawyer also said then that @entity0 does n't have a full - time job , implying that he 's had his struggles since the @entity21 case -- which made him into a national lightning rod when it came to the merits of " @entity118 " laws and matters of race			1
" it 's been a devastating experience that he 's had that he 's working through , " the lawyer said			0
" ... i 'm concerned , obviously			0
" @entity1 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity5 opts not file a formal aggravated assault charge against @entity0
a girlfriend recants her claim that @entity0 threw a bottle at her , she feared him
he became a national lightning rod after being charged , acquitted in @entity21 's death
