-- @entity1 insists the @entity3 circuit in @entity4 that will host his @entity6 title showdown with @entity7 will suit @entity8 as he bids to secure a third successive world title			1
the @entity10 is tantalizingly close to matching a feat accomplished only twice in the sport 's history , by @entity14 and @entity15 , but failed to lock down the championship in @entity17			2
the 25 - year - old came second at the @entity20 @entity19 behind @entity22 's @entity21 , @entity7 finishing third to keep his hopes of a third career @entity6 crown alive			1
now the teams head to @entity27 for the final race of the season , with @entity1 needing only to finish in the top four to take title			1
and the double world champion has fired an ominous warning to his @entity34 rival , claiming the @entity3 circuit is one that he likes , and one that suits his car			1
" we know that the car works and that is a good basis to build on , " he told a press conference after the first @entity20 gp for five years			0
" so i am looking forward to next weekend			0
i like that track and the track suits us and we have always done well there			2
i think anything can happen			0
" we 've been very quick in @entity4 the last couple of years so plenty to look forward to			2
on top of that , we increased our lead in the championship so i think we are in the best possible position			0
" we have been in the game long enough to know how quickly the winds can change -- not only for us -- but also for our competitors			0
" what we have to do is go into the race as focused and as determined as we were this weekend			0
we have to squeeze everything possible out of the race ! " @entity7 has a big fight on his hands to win his first world championship since 2006 and lost ground in @entity61 but he said @entity62 would be giving everything to spoil @entity1 's history - making hat - trick			1
" we will try to go to @entity4 with the possibility to fight for the world championship which is something that we fight for all through the year and we arrived in that fantastic position , " he said			2
" only @entity1 is in a better position than us but we should be proud of ourselves so try to enjoy the @entity4 race and do our best , fight all the race and see what is the outcome at the end			1
" @entity7 was given a helping hand at the @entity74 by his teammate @entity75 , after the gearbox on the @entity4 's car was deliberately broken , giving him a five - place grid penalty			1
that meant @entity7 jumped from eighth on the grid to seventh and got to start on the clean side of the track rather than the dusty side near to the pit lane			1
it helped the @entity87 gain three places going into the first corner and though the move was seen as unsporting in some quarters , team boss @entity90 insisted it was made in the spirit of the rules			0
" yes , otherwise i would n't have done it , " he told reporters			0
" i prefer to be transparent			0
you can easily simulate something			0
i felt it was more correct to say the truth			0
" when you work for the @entity62 team you know the team was the center of the decision			1
i have to thank @entity75 for that			2
it is something that is within our possibility to do it			0
" we knew before the race that the difference between the two sides of the grid was very high and we knew that if we were thinking of trying to achieve @entity4 as the last race it would have been very important to be the front car for the first couple of laps otherwise the race would have been more difficult			1
" i have to thank @entity75 for that			2
he drove extremely well all weekend and this is something that is positive for @entity4 because we need both our drivers doing a great race if we want to challenge @entity1 to win the drivers ' title			1

@entity1 insists the @entity3 track in @entity27 suits @entity8 team
the @entity10 is locked in a battle for the @entity6 title with @entity7
@entity1 likes the circuit in @entity4 where he must finish at least fourth to win title
@entity62 defend decision to *invoke* a grid penalty for @entity75 to benefit @entity7
