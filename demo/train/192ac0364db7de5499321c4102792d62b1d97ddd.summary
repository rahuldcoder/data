@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is writing his life story			1
now the only question is : which life ? the 40 - year - old @entity8 senator , and @entity10 rock star , is shopping his memoir to @entity13 publishing houses			1
there is sure to be a market ; @entity10 want to embrace a @entity17 conservative to shield them from accusations that their immigration rhetoric is @entity20 , and so , for them , @entity3 is the most beloved @entity17 since @entity21			1
a memoir is a good idea			0
@entity3 may need a whole book to explain the contradictions surrounding his biography			1
@entity3 has repeatedly said that his parents left @entity28 after @entity29 took power in january 1959			1
but documents brought to light by the @entity33 and @entity34 reveal that @entity35 and @entity36 arrived in the @entity37 , legally on an immigration visa , much earlier -- in may 1956			0
so what ? that 's the scandal ? @entity3 is clearly not the only @entity37 with a bad memory			1
many @entity42 - @entity37 are so far removed from their families ' immigrant past that , not only can they not tell you when their ancestors migrated to the @entity37 , sometimes they can barely tell you what country their family came from			0
" let 's see , i 'm part @entity51 , and i think i have a little @entity52 and some @entity53			2
" apparently , if you 're @entity28 - @entity37 , it matters a lot			1
there is a pecking order in @entity8			0
being a descendant of those who came as political exiles after @entity29 came to power supposedly carries more cachet than if your family simply came as economic immigrants before @entity29 took power			0
i do n't get it			0
but then , i 'm not @entity28 - @entity37			1
so i defer to two friends ( and media colleagues ) who are			2
@entity72 , publisher of @entity73 , is skeptical about @entity3 getting the dates wrong			2
" when your parents left @entity28 is seared into the memory of every @entity78 , " he told me			1
@entity79 , whose family left @entity28 in the winter of 1962 , was much harder on @entity3			1
in an op - ed for @entity84 , the former @entity2 host blasted the inconsistency and tied it back to the senator 's immigration views			2
" [ @entity3 ] convinced @entity37 that he was the son of political refugees , " @entity79 wrote , " implying that it somehow made him different from the other @entity17 who he attacks regularly -- the ones in @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 that he and others want to detain , arrest and kick out			1
how dare they come here looking for work and to better their lot in life ? @entity3 made us believe he is different from them when he 's not			1
" i understand what my friends are saying			2
and i understand that , as a @entity105 - @entity37 and not a @entity78 , there are some things i will never understand			0
nevertheless , i thought that @entity3 did a fine job of acquitting himself in an op - ed for @entity109			2
" the @entity33 accused me of seeking political advantage by embellishing the story of how my parents arrived in the @entity37 , " he wrote			2
" that is an outrageous allegation that is not only incorrect , but an insult to the sacrifices my parents made to provide a better life for their children ... i am the son of immigrants and exiles , raised by people who know all too well that you can lose your country			2
by people who know firsthand that @entity37 is a very special place ... ultimately what @entity126 writes is not that important to me			0
i am the son of exiles			0
i inherited two generations of unfulfilled dreams			0
this is a story that needs no embellishing			0
" that 's poetry , and yet that op - ed may have backfired			0
@entity137 says that it has found discrepancies between what @entity3 wrote for @entity109 and the account that @entity3 offered on one of its shows two years ago			2
for @entity109 , @entity3 wrote , " in february 1961 , my mother took my older siblings to @entity28 with the intention of moving back ... but after just a few weeks , it became clear that the change happening in @entity28 was not for the better ... so in late march 1961 ... my mother and siblings left @entity28 and my family settled permanently in the @entity37			1
" but , in 2009 , @entity3 told @entity137 's " @entity157 " that his mother returned to @entity28 in 1960 with his older siblings to care for her ailing father and that she wound up staying nine months because the @entity28 government would n't let her and her eldest son , @entity35 , return to the @entity37			1
eventually , she and her children were allowed to leave			0
which is it ? did @entity3 's mother return to @entity28 in 1960 or 1961 ? was she preparing to move back , or caring for a sick parent ? and did she stay " just a few weeks " or nine months ? documents confirm that @entity36 was in @entity28 for just over one month			1
so the story that @entity3 wrote in @entity109 was closer to the truth than the one he shared with @entity137			1
frankly , i do n't know what to make of this story			0
my reporter 's nose tells me there are more " gotcha " revelations to come			0
my head tells me that this whole story does n't matter to most @entity37			0
and my heart tells me that @entity3 would not even be in hot water -- especially with fellow @entity178 -- if he was not a @entity10			1
@entity3 is someone with a shot at becoming the first @entity17 in the @entity180 , he terrifies the @entity182 establishment			1
and so they want to take him out			0
yet , i am quite impressed that the story of one family 's exodus from @entity28 more than 60 years ago has captured the attention of so many of my media colleagues			1
now if i could just get them to focus on a much more important story to which many of them are turning a blind eye : the exodus of more than one million illegal immigrants from the @entity37 , and the breaking up of hundreds of thousands of families , at the hands of the @entity200 administration			0
all of it for the sake of politics			0
now that 's what i call a scandal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			2

@entity209 : @entity10 " rock star " @entity3 has *warring* details in his life story
he says there are *conflicts* in when @entity3 says parents left @entity28 and when they actually did
he says @entity17 friends doubt @entity3 's explanation : @entity28 *emigres* know when they left
@entity209 : only reason it 's an issue is because @entity3 is real *threat* to @entity225
