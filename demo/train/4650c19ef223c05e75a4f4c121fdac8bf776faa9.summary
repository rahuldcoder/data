why @entity0 ? according to his spokesman , @entity6 's move was just " practical " as he plans to invest in companies " that have strong interests in entering the @entity23 markets			1
accordingly , it made the most sense for him to use @entity0 as a home base			1
" one other glaring possibility ? @entity0 has no capital gains tax			0
