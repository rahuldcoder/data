@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 said she often wonders whether anyone really ever sees her			2
she also wonders the same thing about the hundreds of people living around her , in tiny tin shacks perched underneath gum trees on a nearby hill			1
around one million people live near @entity13 's largest slum , @entity14 , located near @entity15 , @entity16			1
sometimes , she said , it seems like they all are invisible			2
the shantytown where @entity3 lives is on the outskirts of @entity21 , @entity13 , in an area known as @entity23			2
the squatter community has been there for a number of years , but it 's increasingly being squeezed out by nearby factories and suburban neighborhoods			1
some residents , according to @entity3 , have already been evicted			2
others are afraid that they could soon be forced to move			2
and almost everyone fears that if they have to leave , there may be nowhere else to go			2
" we are like a lost city , " said @entity3 , who shares a home with her two children and 10 other families			2
" we are not known			0
" @entity39 @entity38 estimates that roughly 1 billion people -- or 33 percent of the world 's urban population -- live in conditions like those of @entity3 and her family			1
by 2030 , according to the @entity39 's human settlement program , that number is likely to double			1
the slum dwellers struggle to survive with little clean water and sometimes no electricity around metropolises like @entity52 , @entity53 ; @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity57 , @entity58 ; and @entity59 , @entity56			0
their shantytowns are usually vast in expanse and dense in population			0
in @entity14 , a slum near @entity15 , @entity16 , for example , more than a million people live in an area about the size of @entity70 's @entity69			1
yet despite their overpowering nature and unavoidable presence , the world 's informal cities are often overlooked -- partly , according to @entity38 , because many aid efforts are still focused on helping the rural poor : " rural poverty has long been the world 's most common face of destitution , " @entity39 secretary - general @entity76 said in a 2006 world city report			1
" but urban poverty can be just as intense , dehumanizing and life - threatening			1
" the problem can also seem too big			0
the slums appear impenetrable to outsiders			1
and no one wants to take full responsibility			0
so walls are built , blinders are put on , and the shantytowns simply fade into the backdrop of urban life			0
" we still do n't know what to do , " said @entity93 , a professor of urban planning at the @entity95			0
" a huge amount of money has been spent and very little has been achieved in terms of reversing the phenomenon			0
" although slums , in and of themselves , are nothing new -- some @entity53 favelas are more than 100 years old , @entity93 said , and many modern cities , like @entity70 and @entity1 , once had prolific slum - dwelling populations -- what is unprecedented is the rate at which they are growing			2
the @entity39 estimates that almost 70 million people move into cities each year , many of them poor			1
yet this , according to some experts , should not be seen as a problem but rather as a potential way to win the war against global poverty			1
the mindset must shift from " city as problem to city as solution , " said @entity124 , president of the @entity125 , which aims to raise awareness on solving long - term problems			0
historically , @entity124 said , squatter cities have always been areas of economic expansion ; within them there is virtually no unemployment , and their inhabitants are constantly striving to lift themselves out of destitution , he said			0
" [ @entity136 ] are generating wealth the way cities have always done , " @entity124 said			0
in @entity55 , almost 20 percent of the gdp comes from @entity54 , where half the city 's 12 million residents live in slums , @entity124 said			1
and even though many slum dwellers work in the informal economy , the official economy benefts as workers accumulate income and can afford to buy more goods and services outside their shadow neighborhoods			0
urbanization also leads to lower birth rates , @entity124 said , which means as more people migrate to cities , the world 's population could eventually level off at around 8 billion or 9 billion and then rapidly drop			1
but to both capture and capitalize upon the potentialities of slums , more must also be done to embrace the people who reside in them and understand how they live their lives , said @entity165 , a journalist who spent two years living in shantytowns around the world			1
many employees working in @entity52 's high - end hotels and restaurants live in nearby favelas , @entity165 said			1
and not all slum dwellers are necessarily poor -- a survey of more than 200 slums across @entity55 by @entity175 , which provides support to informal settlements , found residents with a variety of jobs , including government employees , small entrepreneurs and even doctors			2
" outsiders tend to view these as repositories of criminality , and they are not at all , " he said			0
" these are hardworking communities whose aspirations are the same as yours and mine , and the sooner we understand that , the sooner we can begin working with these communities			0
" some progress has been made , especially in @entity197 , around cities like @entity52			0
there , despite the presence of drug gangs who largely control the communities , a handful of favelas are undergoing a sort of gentrification			0
businesses like cable television companies and banks have moved in , and tourists are even making reservations to stay in new shantytown hotels , @entity165 said			1
yet in the @entity23 slum in @entity13 , along with many others around the world , the situation remains stagnant as governments continue to deny slum dwellers basic infrastructure and property rights and occasionally even demolish entire parts of shantytowns altogether , forcing their dwellers to move to another piece of land and try , once again , to build a new life			0
" we have to recognize these people as people and not as statistics , " @entity165 said			1
" the way forward is to engage with them			0

what do you think should be done to solve urban poverty ? what approaches might be taken to upgrade slums ? what perceptions still must be changed about informal settlements ? share your ideas or stories in the " @entity243 " box below .			1

@entity39 estimates 1 billion people live in slums , number likely to double by 2030
urbanization could hold *key* to ending poverty and *overpopulation* , experts say
*writer* @entity165 says slums must be " engaged , " not ignored
