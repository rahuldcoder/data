-- in the summer of 2007 , two @entity2 groups -- @entity3 and @entity4 -- fought street battles in @entity6			1
@entity3 , loyal to @entity8 president @entity7 , was losing			2
and a @entity10 diplomatic cable indicates that " desperate , disorganized , and demoralized " @entity3 members appealed to @entity12 to attack their rival			1
the cable quotes the head of the @entity12 @entity16 , @entity17 , as telling @entity10 diplomats , " they are approaching a zero - sum situation , and yet they ask us to attack @entity4			1
" @entity17 is also quoted as saying that @entity4 had infiltrated @entity7 ' presidential guard and seized heavy machine guns			2
@entity3 members quickly denied any approach had been made			2
@entity27 , a member of @entity3 's revolutionary council , said such comments are part of a smear campaign carried out by @entity12 , which had never been asked " to address or to assist in any @entity2 national manner			1
" but @entity4 , in a statement that underlines the continuing animosity between the two groups , said that the " @entity37 information regarding the scale of security cooperation between the @entity12 occupation and @entity3 is dangerous information and represents additional evidence regarding the involvement of @entity3 with the occupation			1
" according to the cable , @entity17 told @entity10 ambassador @entity45 that @entity3 was " on its last legs , " and @entity4 was " well - organized and ascendant			1
" but he opposed arming @entity3 , saying , " they are not organized to ensure that the equipment that is transferred to them will reach the intended recipients			0
" he was also wary of requests for @entity3 members to be trained in @entity52 " with a strong @entity54 presence			0
" @entity17 also had harsh words for @entity7 , saying , " he knows he is weak and he has failed			0
he has failed to rehabilitate @entity3			0
" according to the leaked cable , @entity17 also suggested @entity7 would soon retire			0
@entity7 continues as president today			0
the leaked cables also indicate the @entity12 appear to have seen an advantage in @entity4 consolidating its control in @entity6			1
a cable from june 13 , 2007 , quotes the head of @entity12 military intelligence , maj. gen. @entity65 , as saying that " @entity12 would be ' happy ' if @entity4 took over @entity6 because the ( @entity66 ) could then deal with @entity6 as a hostile state			1
" @entity65 played down the threat @entity4 represented , saying @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 were of greater concern , according to the cable			2
he said that while @entity69 already had a presence in @entity6 , " @entity12 could handle the situation so long as @entity6 does not have a port			0
" today , three years since the cables were written , @entity4 still retains control of @entity6 , although much of the territory was devastated by the @entity12 offensive of january 2009 in retaliation for rocket strikes across the border			2
the situation in the @entity85 , still controlled by the @entity8 , is calmer , with better security and investment assisting economic growth			0
@entity89 , a @entity2 lawmaker and former minister , told @entity0 that the leaked cables show " that the internal division in @entity92 is serving only the interest of @entity12 " and that " @entity12 itself encouraged this division			0

@entity37 cable says " desperate " @entity3 asked @entity12 to attack @entity4 in 2007
a @entity3 official says the comment was part of an @entity12 smear campaign
@entity4 calls it " evidence regarding the involvement of @entity3 with the occupation "
