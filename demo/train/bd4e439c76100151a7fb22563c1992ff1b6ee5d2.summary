the name " @entity1 " will enter @entity3 's political vocabulary alongside cities like @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 -- places where black @entity3 rioted in the streets following the violent mistreatment of unarmed black men at the hands of police			1
despite amazing progress in some areas of race relations -- notably , the election and re-election of @entity19 as president -- the @entity3 also harbors a deep , durable strain of racism that occasionally flares into public consciousness , sometimes with explosive results			1
the summer of 2014 was one of those times the curtain was pulled back and the ugliness emerged			2
on july 17 in @entity30 , half a dozen police confronted a man named @entity32 for allegedly selling cigarettes on the street without a license to do so			2
a bystander 's phone camera captured video of the police pushing @entity32 to the ground using a chokehold as @entity32 , a father of six , repeatedly said " i ca n't breathe			2
" he died shortly afterwards			2
a few weeks later on august 5 , in @entity44 , @entity45 , a man named @entity43 was shot to death inside a @entity48 store after police responded to an emergency call about a man waving a weapon			2
@entity43 turned out to be holding a pellet - shooting bb gun he 'd picked up from a shelf inside the store ( which sells the gun )			2
on august 9 in @entity1 , @entity57 , police killed a teenager named @entity59 and left his body uncovered in the street			1
witnesses say @entity59 had his hands up when an officer fired six shots into his body			1
a week of demonstrations and violence followed			2
on august 11 , a 25 - year - old man named @entity70 was shot to death in @entity7			0
police say @entity73 attacked an officer after his car was stopped ; other witnesses say he was not resisting and was killed while lying down in the street			0
all around @entity3 , demonstrations have taken place to protest what some call a national epidemic of police brutality toward black men			1
there 's no sure way of knowing whether there is a pattern of police imposing deadly force on blacks , but civil rights organizations have long complained about racial profiling -- the practice of assuming members of a racial minority group are engaged in criminal activity and detaining or arresting them for that reason alone			1
such practices are illegal under the @entity101			0
" racial profiling continues to be a prevalent and egregious form of discrimination in the @entity3 , " says the website of the @entity103			1
" this unjustifiable practice remains a stain on @entity3 democracy and an affront to the promise of racial equality			1
" @entity3 has fought a long battle to ensure equal opportunity and legal treatment for descendants of the @entity117 slaves who spent centuries in bondage until the practice was outlawed in 1863			1
but many stories show black @entity3 lagging far behind when it comes to economic and educational achievement			1
studies show that white families , for instance , had an average of $ 113,149 in household wealth in 2009 compared with only $ 5,677 for blacks			1
educators have discovered a persistent gap between black and white students on standardized @entity134 and math tests			2
these gaps have existed for decades , but they seldom result in the kind of street demonstrations and riots that followed the recent killings in @entity57 and elsewhere			0
that 's because poverty and ignorance are social ills that people can battle gradually			0
racial profiling and police violence , on the other hand , represents a form of injustice that is impossible to ignore			1
history suggests that grinding poverty and discrimination create social dynamite -- but it 's police violence that triggers the explosion			0
@entity155 of @entity156 recently described some of this history , accurately , as 80 years of @entity159			0
in 1935 , a false rumor swept through @entity6 that a 16 - year - old , arrested for shoplifting , had been killed by police			0
it touched off two days of rioting			0
in 1962 , riots went off in @entity167 -- a stone 's throw from @entity1 -- when a teenager was shot to death while running from a policeman who claimed the boy had tried to grab his gun			1
after riots broke out in @entity5 in 1967 -- five days of chaos that left 41 dead -- a presidential commission found that police aggression , along with racism and discrimination , was to blame			0
in 1980 , the @entity182 section of @entity183 went up in flames after a man named @entity186 died in police custody after a motorcycle crash			0
one responding officer later testified that his fellow cops had beaten @entity186 with flashlights ; when the officers were acquitted , rioters took to the streets			0
@entity183 burned again in 1989 , after an officer shot a motorcyclist to death ( the officer ended up convicted of manslaughter , although the conviction was later overturned )			0
and in @entity7 in 1992 , the acquittal of officers who 'd been videotaped beating a motorist named @entity204 led to riots that left more than 50 people dead			0
then , as now , the social unrest reminds many black @entity3 of a time when violence -- including violence by police -- was used as a tool of social and political intimidation			1
in the 1960s , at the same time urban riots were taking place , police were also used to attack and brutalize african - americans seeking the right to vote			0
a famous series of protests in @entity221 , @entity222 , in 1963 , led by @entity223 , led to mass arrests and attacks by police using dogs , fire hoses and clubs on nonviolent demonstrators			0
a similarly brutal attack on demonstrators followed in @entity233 , @entity222 , in 1965			0
black political leaders are making a connection between the politically - motivated police violence of the past and the current cases of possible profiling			1
it was significant that two of @entity204 's children , @entity241 and @entity243 , attended @entity245 's funeral , along with the rev. @entity246 , who was at @entity204 's side the day he was assassinated			0
the biggest difference between past violence and the current cases is that african - americans now have much greater political influence -- most notably , a black president			1
@entity19 sent high - ranking aides to @entity59 's funeral , and the nation 's top law - enforcement official , attorney general @entity256 , made a personal appearance in @entity57 , wrote an open letter to the town and deployed 40 @entity262 agents to investigate the killing of @entity59			1
the nightly violence involving citizens and police in the days following @entity59 's killing have stopped for now , but the national debate over the politics of policing will continue long into the future			2
even with a black president , this summer 's cases show that suspicions of racial profiling will remain a live , lingering concern from coast to coast as long as cops apply outsized levels of force that rarely , if ever , get applied outside of black communities			1
will we see more @entity283 ? my guess would be yes			0
80 years of history suggest that the inequality and discrimination that continue to plague black communities around @entity3 are still a kind of factory creating vast amounts of social dynamite			1
those tensions can be detonated by a single clash between police and citizens in a country where encounters take place thousands of times every day			0
so the odds suggest there will be more times when @entity3 pays the price for maintaining a gap between the @entity3 dream and the very real nightmare of poverty and racism in our midst .			2

@entity315 says racial divisions in @entity3 were again exposed by the shooting of @entity59
@entity319 lag behind when it comes to economic and educational opportunities , studies show
even with a black president , suspicions of racial profiling will remain a live , lingering concern , says @entity315
louis predicts more *flashpoints* like what happened in @entity1
