@entity0 -- the stage is set for @entity3			1
arguably the greatest tennis player of all time , one of the two things missing from his resume -- which must be a dozen pages if not longer -- is a @entity9 title			2
but after his @entity10 beat @entity11 in the pivotal doubles tussle saturday , the @entity10 are one win away from wrapping up the final in @entity0 -- and it 's @entity3 who has first crack at completing the job			1
you would n't possibly bet against him , would you ? " nothing is done yet , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" we won the doubles match and we are preparing for tomorrow , as we have to do			2
" @entity3 entered the final -- one of the most anticipated in decades due to his presence and @entity11 's love of tennis -- under an injury cloud			1
he was forced to withdraw from the final of the @entity29 last sunday with a bad back and then looked unlike his usual self in a crushing loss to @entity33 on friday			0
yet @entity3 was adamant he felt better as the match wore on against @entity33 and hinted he wanted -- and was ready -- to play doubles			1
@entity10 captain @entity36 was n't about to go against the 17 - time grand slam champion , and he was duly brought in alongside the surging @entity38 to replace the originally scheduled duo of @entity40 and @entity41			1
the decision paid off , with @entity3 and @entity38 snapping a four - match losing streak in doubles together in the @entity9 by easing past @entity45 and @entity46 6 - 3 7 - 5 6 - 4			1
" i 'm fine now , " @entity3 said when asked about his back			2
" i understand you want to know everything about it			0
but i know as much as you do			0
" i 've been very open and honest			0
for me it 's just about now whatever it feels like , i feel like i am at 100 %			0
i 'll give it 100 %			0
that 's all i can do right now			0
" only twice since 1990 has the nation trailing 2 - 1 in the final rallied to triumph , such is the task facing the bewildered @entity58			0
" nothing is broken , " @entity11 captain @entity59 told reporters			0
" but it is a difficult situation			0
it 's tough to take			0
i ca n't lie about that			0
@entity45 has had a longstanding love - hate relationship with the @entity11 tennis public			1
they were in awe of his ability and he rose to the fore by toppling @entity3 as an 18 - year - old in @entity72 in 2005			0
his hunger , willingness to fight and mental toughness have all been questioned , however , and the naysayers will have more ammunition following his display saturday			0
he was the least comfortable player on the court			0
@entity59 has some serious thinking to do overnight , pondering who will battle @entity3 on sunday			2
@entity82 is due to be that player , but @entity82 underwhelmed in a loss to @entity38 on friday and the head of the @entity85 , @entity86 , reportedly said the @entity11 no. 1 had an elbow injury			1
it might explain why @entity82 did n't play with @entity45 after they practiced together saturday morning and excelled in doubles in the semifinals against the @entity93			1
@entity45 was out of sorts in the doubles saturday , and @entity59 would raise many an eyebrow if he opted for @entity46			1
despite his good play in the doubles and possessing two wins over @entity3 , @entity46 's record in singles finals -- 0 - 10 , which is an @entity103 record of futility -- hints he is unable to function at his best when the pressure is really on			1
@entity46 's serve was broken in the first set for the lone break , but @entity45 did n't hit two volleys cleanly in the game , allowing the @entity10 to pounce			1
" i did n't play an exceptional match today and i 'm disappointed , " @entity45 told reporters			2
it was nothing compared to the decisive second set , which began slightly late as @entity45 and @entity46 left the court for a toilet break			2
@entity11 had five break points in three different games			0
at 1 - 0 for @entity11 , @entity45 's tame second - serve return let the @entity10 off the hook			1
at 2 - 1 , @entity46 mistimed a forehand return into the net and @entity45 's forehand down the line clipped the net and strayed wide			1
chants of ' @entity129 ' from most of the 27,360 in attendance at the @entity132 @entity131 -- less than 100 fans short of friday 's record number for a pro tennis match -- prior to the return clearly did n't work			0
then at 4 - 3 , @entity45 's return off a second serve failed to put the @entity10 in any danger			1
@entity45 did n't have much of an opportunity on the final break chance , with @entity38 pummeling a serve			1
with @entity11 reeling , the inevitable break for @entity10 came at 5 - 5 when @entity3 struck a backhand return winner			1
" if @entity129 's return did n't hit the tape , the stadium would have gone crazy and the energy would have been different , " @entity46 said			2
" it was tough to lose this second set because we had the feeling that we really could have won this one			0
" there was no way back for @entity11 , and its fate was sealed when the @entity10 broke for 3 - 2 in the third			2
with @entity3 now looking sharper and the @entity11 in some disarray , the home team 's fate in the tie appears to be sealed , too .			1

@entity3 and @entity10 are one match away from winning a maiden @entity9
@entity3 and @entity38 won the doubles saturday against @entity11 in @entity0
@entity3 and @entity38 *defeat* @entity45 and @entity46 in *straight* sets
@entity3 has the opportunity to close out the series as he plays sunday 's first singles
