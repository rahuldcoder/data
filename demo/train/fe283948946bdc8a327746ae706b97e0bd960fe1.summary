we 're days past that little football game sunday in @entity3 , and it keeps trending like crazy on @entity4 , which makes sense			1
even if you do n't know a kicking tee from the 50 - yard line , you know @entity10 was the site of the worst coaching decision in the history of professional sports , one that kept the @entity16 from consecutive @entity18 titles			1
as of wednesday afternoon , both the @entity20 and the @entity16 were generating nearly 1,000 tweets per hour , and remember : this is happening in the @entity24 world , where stuff that occurred five minutes ago already is ancient news			1
then there was @entity20 coach @entity28 taking time away wednesday from his team 's victory parade in @entity31 to give his thoughts on the subject			1
why not ? the rest of the universe is doing the same			1
the agony of defeat always trumps the thrill of victory when it comes to tugging at the soul			1
the @entity20 did n't win sunday in @entity42 , @entity3			1
for verification , there are a bunch of hash tags to prove it			1
during a 24 - hour - period through tuesday evening , there were 400 tweets per hour about the @entity20 capturing a fourth @entity49			1
they did so with their familiar tandem of @entity28 and quarterback @entity52 , the designated all - american boy with the supermodel wife			1
yeah , well , during that same time frame , there were 2,800 tweets per hour about the @entity16			1
it 's just more interesting to contemplate how the @entity16 blew a @entity10 victory in the final seconds despite sitting inches away from a game - winning touchdown			1
they got that close to scoring after a catch that would make @entity65 envious			1
moments later , @entity67 's offensive brain trust of head coach @entity68 and coordinator @entity69 did their own high - wire act without a net			1
they decided to throw the ball into the end zone instead of giving it to explosive running back @entity77 , who basically was low risk			2
the ball was intercepted , and early during the afterward , i began thinking : " i have n't seen this much grief up close and personal after a brutal loss in 23 years			2
" back then , when tweets were only done by birds , the @entity83 shocked the @entity86 with a rally out of nowhere in the bottom of the ninth inning to snatch the 1992 @entity91 pennant			2
@entity92 forgot he was the slowest man in baseball to score the game - winning run from second base at @entity97 after he slid underneath a throw by @entity99 left fielder @entity100			2
the @entity86 clubhouse was a morgue			2
hours later , when i finished writing for the night , i peeked inside the place for a final time			2
it was empty -- except for @entity106 center fielder @entity106 sitting motionless on a stool in the middle of the room , staring a hole into the floor			2
there also was 1981 , when i stood among those rubbing their eyes in @entity116 , @entity117 , as tiny @entity118 used the last seconds to shove @entity121 - ranked @entity120 out of the first round of the @entity124 basketball tournament			2
with tears flowing across his big face , @entity120 star player @entity125 ran out of the arena into the snowy afternoon			2
he walked all the way back to the team hotel , and i followed him for part of his journey			0
when i returned , @entity120 coach @entity134 , who was nearly 70 , eased outside of his locker room , sighing heavily before reporters and looking ready to collapse any moment			0
the @entity16 locker room was a little of those @entity86 , a little of those @entity139 and a lot of something else : pure anger			0
i was among the few reporters in the @entity16 locker room from the time it opened until we were asked to leave about an hour later			0
in between , i saw @entity16 players ignore protocol in these situations			0
instead of saying the @entity151 is flat and their offensive brain trust knew what it was doing near the end , they ripped that nonrunning play like the rest of us			1
on one side of the @entity16 locker room , there was wide receiver @entity161 blasting at will ( " all of us are surprised " ) , and on the other side , there was somebody else , and then somebody else			0
" i do n't understand how you do n't give ( the ball ) to the best back in the league , on not even the one - yard line , " said linebacker @entity171 , with the body language of a guy trying to recover from the flu after getting smacked by a semi			0
across the way , as teammates grumbled in and out of the shower , defensive backs @entity181 and @entity182 were more depressed than @entity171 , especially @entity182			0
they sat frozen in their seats for the longest time , resembling this generation 's @entity106 in my world			0
it 's not as if they are this century 's @entity189 and @entity190			0
to hear @entity192 tell it , it took him nearly two decades to forgive @entity195 fans for cursing his name through the years after his gaffe during the @entity198			0
@entity190 was a star defensive back in 1981 for the @entity199			0
even so , he still is tormented by @entity200 , which was @entity201 throwing that miracle pass over his head to @entity204 to push the @entity205 into the @entity10			1
at one point , quarterback @entity206 , who threw the interception , dropped by to console @entity181 and @entity182			0
then came @entity68 with a few words , but nothing helped			0
@entity181 and @entity182 just sat there , thinking , hurting , wondering when this nightmare would end			0
apparently not as long as it keeps trending			0
which looks like forever .			0

days after the @entity10 , the *chatter* about the losing play goes on .
@entity220 : the ending *reminds* us of other *dramatic* *reversals* in sports
