then the @entity2 government sent a terrorist group to make an explosion bomb there , one of our group was killed and more than 20 injured			1
" we moved from @entity6 , to @entity7 , @entity8 , then @entity9 , then @entity10 like refugees , like nomads to try to save our lives and try to make more films			1
" leaving his country , @entity0 said , was the price for continuing to make films , but it was a decision he did not take lightly			1
he said : " when we are out of our country somehow we become a little depressed , we lose our root in our culture but we will find something more			0
we could see our nation from outside from different angles			0
" being out of @entity2 , out of the @entity50 , is not easy for me really because i belong to that part of the earth			1
but how can we do it when in @entity2 we should ( would ) be in prison , they will torture us , when we are even in @entity6 they try to kill us ? they did n't let us make more films , they censored all the books that i wrote , so we come out to do something			1

they were searching for meaning for their life			0
they were asking me : if we go to ordinary school , if we follow the same level that everybody has , it has no meaning for us			0
" @entity98 said of conventional education in @entity2 : " they were talking to me about how to wear a scarf and if my hand shows up i will go to the hell , and everything about religion			2

i loved the things that my father was teaching			0

@entity0 said : " the government is going to put him for six years in prison to announce to the other artists look at @entity161 : ' if you are famous like @entity164 we put you under pressure			2
' it is an example for ( the ) @entity2 government			2
" he added that many artists were put under pressure or jailed in @entity2			2
" most of them could not work there , but say , ' if i come out i would become depressed , i would become homesick , i do n't want to leave ( the ) country even if i could n't work in the country , " said @entity0			2
