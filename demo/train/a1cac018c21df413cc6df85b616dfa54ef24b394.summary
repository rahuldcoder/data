the chairman of the @entity19 of the election commission , @entity21 , said official results may be known by monday morning			1
the formerly banned @entity14 was vying for 45 seats in the election			1
while the balance of power in the parliament will not change even if the opposition were to win all 45 , the vote itself marks a symbolic victory for many in the country who have lived under military rule for 50 years			1
@entity5 , 66 , won by a landslide the last time @entity1 held multiparty elections , in 1990 , but the junta ignored the results and placed her under house arrest			1
released in november 2010 , @entity5 was allowed to crisscross the country to rally support for the @entity14 for sunday 's race			1
the @entity14 fielded a candidate for every seat , with @entity5 representing @entity44 , south of the former capital city of @entity19			1
she ran against a former military doctor			2
the government promised the vote would be free and fair and allowed international observers to monitor the polling			2
analysts said the sheer number and spread of polling booths across the country would make it impossible for international monitors to ensure an honest count			0
ahead of the election , @entity5 alleged there had been voting irregularities , illegal activities and intimidation either committed or encouraged by official entities			1
sunday , @entity12 , the @entity14 spokesman , said the party had received more than 50 reports of voting irregularities			1
in one area , ballot sheets had wax placed over the check box for the @entity14 , making it easier to erase the mark later and annul the vote , he said			2
in another area , ballots were found that had already been filled out , he said			0
@entity80 chairman @entity79 said he hoped the elections were fair but could n't speak to the allegations of irregularities			0
" it 's too soon to say , " he said			0
still , @entity5 hoped her party would win as many parliamentary seats as possible			1
@entity1 's legislature has 664 seats , more than 80 % of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military - backed ruling party , @entity92 ( @entity92 )			1
the 45 seats under contention are vacancies created by the promotion of parliamentarians to the @entity98 and other posts last year			1
still , the election is an opportunity for voters to weigh in during a time of enormous change in @entity1 , a country also known as @entity1			2
analysts said it would be the first real test of the government 's commitment to transition from military rule			0
two years ago , it staged a general election that was widely derided as a sham			0
several former military leaders formed the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) at the time to contest the election			0
@entity5 's party boycotted it			1
after attracting international condemnation for manipulating the voting process in the 2010 race , @entity1 's leaders know that a fair election will be proof to the world that it can conduct a legitimate vote , experts said			2
" it 's hugely important and it will provide a new semi-democratic political system with an opportunity to show that it has ambition to become more transparent , more inclusive and thus more democratic , " said @entity125 , a research fellow at the @entity126 , about sunday 's race			0
in the past 12 months , the country pardoned hundreds of political prisoners , secured a cease - fire with @entity137 rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups			0
@entity140 press rules have encouraged the proliferation of journals and magazines			0
@entity1 's efforts to thaw its frosty relations with the rest of the world have been warmly welcomed and rewarded			0
in recent months , a steady procession of foreign ministers has visited the country and , in february , the @entity151 lifted a travel ban on @entity1 officials			0
there have been hints , too , that a free and fair vote on sunday will lead to the relatively swift unraveling of sanctions that have long choked the country 's economy			2
thousands of @entity1 living in exile around the world were watching the election for a clear sign that it is safe to return home			0
young voters in @entity1 appeared to be particularly excited about the polling			0
just the sight of @entity5 brazenly pitching her policies to huge crowds of people emboldened many to dare to believe that democracy might be possible			1
" i am so happy and proud of voting freely , " said @entity175 , 30 , on sunday			0
" i believe the government will change toward democracy			2
" analysts said @entity5 is all but guaranteed to win her seat			1
" it would be a major shock if she did not win her own seat			0
but i think we have to prepare people for the expectations that the @entity14 will not win all seats in the by - election , " said @entity187 , a project director at @entity188			2
others said the number of seats won by the @entity14 is less critical than what the vote says about @entity1 's future			1
" i do n't think it matters how many seats the @entity14 wins			1
i think the only thing that really matters ( is ) whether it 's free or fair			0
i do n't think the people of @entity1 care about how many seats the @entity14 wins either			1
what they want to know is whether the next set of elections , the national elections ( expected in 2015 ) , are also going to be free and fair , " said @entity202 , of the @entity203			0
the daughter of gen. @entity5 , a hero of @entity1 independence , @entity5 herself became an inspiration with her long struggle for democracy in the country			1
as a member of parliament , @entity5 would be expected to be free to travel outside @entity1 -- and more importantly to return -- something that was n't possible during her long years of repression and confinement			2
she told hundreds of journalists gathered outside her residence friday that she did n't plan to become a minister in the military - backed civilian government , if a position was offered to her			0
under @entity1 's constitution , lawmakers ca n't hold ministerial office			0
asked where she would place @entity1 's democracy on a scale of one to 10 , @entity5 said , " we 're trying to get to one			2
" @entity2 's @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
