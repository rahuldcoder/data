-- @entity1 must be one of the few chief executives who dreams of a world where her job does n't exist			1
in fact , the president of one of the biggest poverty charities on the planet -- @entity11 -- would probably prefer it if there was no need for her organization at all			1
yet on any given day there will be a humanitarian disaster unfolding across the globe -- from violence in @entity21 , to flooding in @entity23 , and chemical warfare in @entity25			2
and all of them need @entity11			1
" we always say at @entity11 that we would love to see if we can work ourselves out of business , " said the 58 - year - old			1
" if @entity11 does n't need to exist as it is 20 years from now , so be it			1
but i think it 's safe to say that there will still be a need for relief in this world -- there will still be an unstable country or a fragile environment			0
" the business of charity since it first began over 60 years ago with @entity43 charities sending food packages to @entity46 survivors , @entity11 -- of which @entity11 is a member -- has become one of the largest aid organizations in the world , with 10,000 staff working in some 80 countries			1
last year the charity helped more than 83 million people across the globe -- and was ranked the seventh best ngo on the planet in 2013			2
it 's an enormous operation , and one which @entity1 -- one of @entity62 magazines ' " 100 most powerful women " -- has led since 2006			1
" the more you look into health and health inequalities , you realize that a lot of it is not due to a particular disease -- it 's really linked to underlying societal issues such as poverty , inequity , lack of access to safe drinking water and housing , " she said			0
" and these are all the things we focus on at @entity11			1
" women of the world when former pediatrician @entity1 joined @entity11 seven years ago , she became not just the first woman to lead the organization , but the first person of color			1
while being an @entity43 female in a business environment usually dominated by white men has n't hindered her career , it 's still something she 's acutely aware of			1
" when i walk into a room that is all white and all male , i 'm sitting on the outside of that club			0
that 's sometimes an intimidating experience , " she said			0
" but i think that everywhere that i 've gotten is because i 've worked hard			0
i have the experience , i have the credentials -- i continue not to take any of that for granted			0
" watch : ceo says ' being fearless fueled my success ' it is perhaps unsurprising that @entity1 has now made women 's rights a big focus at @entity11			1
" we know that if you educate a girl , as the saying goes , you educate a nation , " said @entity1			2
" that girl will get married later , she will have fewer children , she 's more likely to earn an income and that income is more likely to be plowed back into the family so that the family benefits			0
" @entity119 spirit growing up in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity1 's own social worker mother was a huge influence in her career			2
" i grew up at a time in the sixties where there was a lot of social change going on -- the civil rights movement , women 's movement , anti apartheid , " she said			0
" my mother really gave that sense to us of giving back to the community			0
she 'd say ' you 've got a good brain , and a big mouth , use it			0
' " @entity1 did n't disappoint , working for over three decades at the @entity141 , and the @entity142 , focusing on hiv / aids research			1
" just a few years ago less that 1 % of people who needed treatment [ for @entity143 ] had access to it and now it 's up to 55 % and growing , " she said			2
" we are now on the track to absolutely eliminate pediatric hiv infection globally			0
" where there is a will walk around @entity1 's office today it 's lined with honorary university degrees and awards from @entity157 and @entity158			2
she points to a photograph of herself with @entity160 during a trip with the former @entity163 secretary of health to @entity164 -- an experience she describes as " electric			0
" but among the high - brow accolades , @entity1 remains focused on simple achievements such as education , access to clean drinking water , and shelter			1
" we believe that it 's possible to eliminate extreme poverty over the next couple of decades			0
we know what needs to be done and we have the tools , " she said , adding : " but do we have the will as a world community to do it ? "			0
