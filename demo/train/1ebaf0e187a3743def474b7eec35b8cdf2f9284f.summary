-- the problem with seeing negotiation as a game of chicken is that sometimes you get what you want , but most of the time everyone just gets plucked			1
that is what i tell my mediation clients , when they take more and more extreme positions , and insist everyone else needs to back down			0
that is what i tell my negotiation students when they give blustering ultimatums and ignore what the other side wants			1
and that is what i wish someone would tell the parties in @entity25 battling over the budget and a looming default			1
so , what do you do when you realize you 're in a negotiation where everyone will be worse off if no one finds a path out ? consider the following : 1 ) the immediate problem is not how you got here , it is how you are going to get out			1
there will be plenty of time later to learn and teach lessons			0
right now you need to find a path to a better outcome			0
accusations , dissections of past mistakes and allocations of blame will only make it harder to get there			2
2 ) there is no " they " on the other side			0
parties in negotiation tend to say , " they are unreasonable , " " they are negotiating in bad faith , " or " they are crazy ! " of course , in the current congressional struggle , pundits and politicians are saying far worse ( such as " they are anarchists " and " they are fascists			1
but thinking of the other party as " they " empowers the most extreme people on the other side			0
instead you need to figure out who is most sympathetic to your position and who is least			0
and you need to negotiate in a way that empowers those most sympathetic and marginalizes the rest			0
when a party 's position is extreme , responding in an extreme way only unifies the other side 's moderates with their extremists			2
3 ) do n't just throw the steering wheel out the window			2
i recently heard a " negotiation expert " on the radio			2
he said that when you are in a game of negotiation chicken , you should throw your steering wheel out the window and then tell the other side that you ca n't turn			1
but what happens when both sides follow his advice ? there is a reason you do n't see many real games of chicken			1
and there is a reason that no one actually throws the steering wheel out the window if he or she does play chicken			2
those people do n't live very long			2
4 ) keep your eye on your goal and do n't get lost in the negotiation game			1
strategizing , positioning and winning the negotiation game is exhilarating			1
but do n't get so caught up in the maneuvering that you lose sight of your goals			2
when @entity114 agreed that it would give back pay to furloughed employees but not return them to work , everyone lost sight of the goal			2
is there someone in the political spectrum who thinks we need to spend just as much money but get nothing for it ? 5 ) negotiation is not about always meeting in the middle if negotiations always met in the middle , that would just encourage everyone to take extreme initial positions			1
meeting in the middle only makes sense if you are meeting between two reasonable positions			1
so , an effective negotiator searches for the possible area of overlap between the parties and then tries to maximize the value the negotiator takes away			2
an ineffective negotiator looks only at what he or she wants and then views negotiation as inflating the negotiator 's demands in order to meet back in the middle			1
6 ) fear can be good			0
too many negotiators focus entirely on trying to scare the other party into making a deal			0
not enough negotiators realize they also need to give the other party hope that a deal is possible , and that the deal would be better than walking away			0
and far too many negotiators push the other side beyond fear to anger			0
making others in a negotiation angry just makes it harder to get the deal you want			1
why would you ever want to anger the person who has to say " yes " for you to have a deal ? 7 ) insulting the other parties is just throwing away your negotiating capital			1
if members of the other side feel insulted , they will get angry , and it will be harder to get them to say " yes " to anything			0
and the biggest problem is that it wo n't matter if you intended to insult them			1
so , when your worldview is very different from another party 's view , be careful that what seems obvious to you is not perceived as insulting by the other party			0
8 ) playing chicken is for people who love risk , do n't value relationships and do n't mind losing deals			1
if you find yourself playing negotiation chicken , make sure you have something to do if you crash			1
and figure out if the other side is actually prepared to crash			0
chicken is for people who like the thrill of winning			0
chicken is for people who value getting a marginal advantage in some deals , at the cost of losing other deals entirely			0
and chicken is for gamblers			0
are you one of those kind of people ? and , if you are a lawyer , negotiator or member of @entity114 , are the people you represent those kind of people ? because if they are not , they are likely to be very angry if you crash			0
and i have already mentioned that anger is bad for negotiators			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity218 : @entity25 should take note -- negotiation should n't be a game of chicken
he says to get a deal the idea is not to blame others but to get out of a problem
he says keep an eye on the goal and remember insults and anger can *backfire* on the process
@entity216 : negotiation is n't about meeting in middle , it 's about maximizing parties ' *takeaway*
