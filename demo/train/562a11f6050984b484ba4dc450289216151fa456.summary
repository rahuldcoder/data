-- president @entity1 recast the @entity3 fight against terrorism as no longer a " boundless global war " but a targeted effort to dismantle specific extremist networks			1
he said @entity3 was at a " crossroads " and should no longer see it as a " self - defeating " perpetual fight , but one that must at some point end , " like all wars			1
" @entity1 said " the core of @entity18 in @entity19 and @entity20 is on a path to defeat , '' but its affiliates elsewhere pose dangers			2
he also touched on new overseas and homegrown threats , and explained publicly the use of drones against terror suspects overseas			1
@entity1 : @entity3 will keep deploying drones -- when they are only option he renewed his push to close the detention facility at @entity32 , @entity33 , and also sought to calm criticism around his administration 's investigation of national security leaks			1
@entity1 , ' troubled ' by leak investigations , asks for review he even paused his prepared remarks to take on a woman in the audience from " @entity44 " who interrupted him several times in open disagreement			1
@entity1 interrupted " i think that the , and i 'm going off script as you might expect here ...			2
the voice of that woman is worth paying attention to , " @entity1 said to applause			1
" obviously i do not agree with much of what she said and obviously she was n't listening to me in what i said but these are tough issues and the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong			0
" here are five things we learned from the speech : 1			0
using drones are ok , but ... the @entity1 administration for the first time revealed wednesday that drones had killed four @entity3 citizens since 2009			1
@entity1 used the speech to more definitively explain the @entity3 policy on the use of lethal force and sought stricter review of its use			1
still , he said drones were both legal and effective to combat terrorists , and added that @entity3 overseas who wish to do the @entity3 harm were fair game , in the most extreme cases			1
" when a @entity3 citizen goes abroad to wage war against @entity3 -- and is actively plotting to kill @entity3 citizens ; and when neither the @entity3 , nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot -- his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a swat team , " @entity1 said			1
he said ordering strikes is a heavy burden , but added that " to do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties			0
" @entity1 said he is asking his administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of war zones that go beyond reporting to @entity106			2
@entity0 's senior political analyst @entity107 says @entity1 defends the use of drones			1
" but he also really acknowledged that it can be overused , even by a president , and that you can not just depend on drones for your national security			0
i was n't kidding about closing @entity117 ... when he was first elected in 2008 , @entity1 vowed to shut down the military detention facility at @entity32 , also known as @entity117			1
but in the years since , @entity106 has enacted significant restrictions on the transfer of detainees from the prison that made its closure impractical			0
and , as costs of running the facility balloon and detainees wage hunger strikes protesting their imprisonment , the administration has quietly dialed back the intensity of the push to shut down the facility			2
" the original premise for opening @entity135 -- that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention -- was found unconstitutional five years ago , " said @entity1			1
" in the meantime , @entity135 has become a symbol around the world for an @entity3 that flouts the rule of law			2
" he called on @entity106 to " lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from @entity135 , " appointed a special envoy to " achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries , " and lifted the moratorium on detainee transfers to @entity147 , where 56 of @entity117 's 86 detainees are from			2
at @entity32 , a costly confinement @entity154 life at @entity32 : hunger strikes , sprays of filth 3			2
no leaks , but there 's that @entity161 thing ... @entity1 has come under fire for recent investigations into leaks by his @entity165 where phone records were seized from reporters and editors at @entity169 and a @entity171 reporter was labeled in a @entity165 affidavit as " potentially being an ' aider and abettor and / or co-conspirator ' " to the crime of disclosing secret information			2
@entity165 tracked @entity171 reporter 's e-mail , movements so he used the speech to try to quell criticism for those intrusions			0
" as commander - in - chief , i believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field , " @entity1 said			2
" but a free press is also essential for our democracy			0
i am troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable			0
" " journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs			0
our focus must be on those who break the law , " he added			0
he vowed to push for a federal shield law for journalists and convene a group of media organizations to review existing guidelines about investigations that involve reporters			0
a new term brings a new policy @entity1 clearly used the speech to redefine @entity3 policy on the so - called " war on terror , " acknowledging that where once the battle was fought on foreign soil , the threats have moved			1
" now make no mistake : our nation is still threatened by terrorists			0
from @entity222 to @entity223 , we have been tragically reminded of that truth			0
we must recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11			0
with a decade of experience to draw from , now is the time to ask ourselves hard questions - about the nature of today 's threats , and how we should confront them			0
" " from our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects , the decisions we are making now will define the type of nation -- and world -- that we leave to our children , " @entity1 said			1
" i was listening to a president who was saying to us , ' let 's get beyond where we were when i first took office , and let me tell you how my thinking has evolved since i 've been president of the @entity3 , ' " said @entity0 's senior political analyst @entity107			2
" he said , ' we must define the nature and scope of this struggle or it will define us			0
' " but @entity1 will face opposition as he attempts to shift @entity3 policy			1
" both on drones and on @entity32 , he 's going to get some pushback , " said @entity107			1
free speech also means ' you listen ' a loud woman interrupted the president several times during his speech , calling on @entity1 to close the @entity32 facility			1
but the president was talking about just that when he was interrupted			0
" you are commander - in - chief -- you can close @entity32 today , " she yelled			1
" it 's been 11 years ! " @entity1 stopped in the middle of his remarks and shot back			2
" this is part of free speech , is you being able to speak but also you listening and me being able to speak , alright ? " @entity1 said			1
the woman was identified as @entity272 , a co-founder of the protest group @entity44 and was later escorted out of the building and released			0
photos : the face of @entity44 later , he even tweaked his closing line to incorporate the heckler in the audience			0
" @entity281 will be measured in parents taking their kids to school , immigrants coming to our shores , fans taking in a ballgame , a veteran starting a business ; a bustling city street , a citizen shouting their concerns at a president , " he concluded			0
@entity0 's @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .			0
