to a sold - out audience			1
at least , that 's what their real - life counterparts — along with other cast members and writer / producers of " @entity17 " — did wednesday evening for the @entity22 comedy 's @entity20 panel in @entity24 ' @entity23			1
@entity20 2013 : ' @entity26 ' cast on alter - egos and the future of @entity29 and @entity30 the event , presented by the @entity20 , was pretty short on spoilers			1
the production schedule is currently not that far ahead of viewers , who will get to see the 19th episode of season six tonight , but there were plenty of entertaining and funny behind - the - scenes stories and playful moments among the talent on the panel , which was moderated by " @entity43 " actress @entity42			1
read on for 10 highlights from the " @entity17 " panel : 1			1
the scene when @entity47 first tells @entity2 " i love you " was shot in only one take @entity50 ( @entity47 ) , whose face brightened with a big grin when asked about this scene , revealed that she and @entity53 ( @entity2 ) pulled it off in just one " very special take			0
" executive producer @entity56 recalled telling the two actors , " ' that was beautiful			0
it 's never gon na be better than that , ' and then @entity50 said to @entity53 , ' i do n't know about you , but we started the scene , and it was like the audience went away and the cameras went away and it was just us			2
' " that got a big " awww " out of the @entity20 crowd			1
everybody loves @entity70 the cast and writers seem to be having a fun time with @entity74 aboard the show playing @entity3 's ( sort of ) girlfriend , @entity70			1
" it 's really fun playing opposite an actress that is talented and really listens and reacts , " @entity77 ( @entity3 ) told @entity0 in the press tent before the panel			1
inside the @entity23 , he told the crowd that he has enjoyed this storyline " because you play a character for six years , and in my case , you grow affection for that character			0
you really want to see that character succeed			0
it 's really lovely to see him explore that side , which i think has been missed for so long while he 's been seeing the growth of his friends			2
" co-creator @entity98 told @entity0 that @entity3 and @entity70 's recent texting date wo n't be the last time we see them come up with a creative way to communicate , but @entity3 will also " continue to rely on demon rum to help him overcome his shyness			2
" he 's not going to let that pesky selective mutism get in his way ! @entity108 to executive produce tv series about real - life geniuses 3			1
that spanking scene @entity112 went old - school with his punishment for @entity116 when she lied about being sick			2
though " punishment " is n't exactly how the delighted @entity116 thought of the near - @entity118 experience			2
@entity108 ( @entity112 ) revealed that while the spanking was always in the script for that december 2012 episode , it was originally planned to be off - camera			1
the original gag had @entity116 's spanking , along with two other points of the episode , paired with the image of @entity116 's monkey mimicking the image of " see no evil , " " hear no evil " and then " speak no evil			1
" ultimately , once the writers decided to put the spanking on - camera , @entity134 found the scene " one of the hardest things i 've had to do — because it was so amusing			2
" after @entity50 and @entity53 recalled the shot needing several takes , @entity143 ( @entity116 ) confessed , " there was some redness ! " 4			0
how did last fall 's flash mob come together ? when the cast and crew surprised their studio audience — and their producers — with a flash mob dance last october , it was the result of two weeks of rehearsals			1
the idea was @entity50 's , who recruited her sister to do the choreography			2
as for that back - spin of @entity53 's , the actor had originally expressed no interest in participating , but " i saw their last rehearsal , and after rolling my eyes for two weeks , i said , ' i really want to be a part of this , ' " @entity53 recalled			1
he did n't have time to learn the whole dance , but he contributed his move that he " usually save [ s ] for weddings			0
we may see @entity112 's @entity172 in a future episode when an audience member questioned the producers about @entity112 's oft - talked - about but yet - to - be - seen grandmother , @entity56 said , " we 've talked about [ having her appear on the show ]			1
i certainly do n't rule it out			0
i do n't know how she 'd feel about @entity116			0
" when that last comment was met with nervous laughter and hmms from the audience , @entity56 quickly followed up : " she loves @entity185 ! she will love @entity185 ! " ' arrow , ' ' @entity17 , ' ' @entity187 , ' ' ncis : @entity188 ' : find out what 's next in the @entity190 6			1
how does one call up @entity191 to ask him to do that scene ? when the writers created the scene in which @entity194 has a dream about " @entity197 " hottie @entity196 that is soon interrupted by @entity191 , the task of calling up the celebrated " @entity201 " actor about the guest spot fell to co-creator @entity202			0
" we wrote a line of @entity194 saying , ' i 'm so confused ' and thought it 'd be really funny if @entity191 said , ' confused ? perhaps i can help			2
" how do i say to this guy that he 's a possible homosexual fantasy ? ... finally i said , ' alright , so you know you 're gay , right ? ' and he said , " — cue @entity191 accent — " ' that 's news			2
i 'll tell my husband			0
tonight 's episode is a touching and emotional one tonight 's episode , titled " @entity214 , " centers around a discovery @entity112 makes when reorganizing @entity217 and @entity194 's closet : he unwittingly opens a letter from @entity194 's father ( who abandoned @entity194 and mrs. @entity222 when he was a kid ) that our favorite diminutive engineer has never braved reading since he received it at age 18			1
it 's an emotion - filled episode , the cast said , that features each character supporting @entity194 through the tough situation in their own way			1
" you get to see how good [ @entity194 's ] friends really are and how kind of fallible they are and yet unflappable			2
but everybody is coming from a sweet , good place , " @entity237 ( @entity194 ) told @entity0			0
" they 're all put in a position to figure out how to best support their friend , " @entity53 told @entity0			0
" it 's a sensitive issue , and i think the conclusion that they come to is really smart and unique and has never been done on television before			2
it 's one of my favorite episodes , i swear to @entity250			2
i 'm not just saying that ... it really is			0
" ' @entity17 ' : dr. @entity1 inspires new bee name 8			1
how will the season six finale compare to last season 's big closer ? " that was pretty big , " @entity98 said to @entity0 of the season five finale			1
" a wedding and a @entity260 rocket into space is pretty big			0
i think we can safely say this [ year 's finale ] will be smaller , more intimate			0
the tale of @entity266 's " smurfette " the biggest applause of the night was saved for the hilarious @entity266 ( @entity217 )			0
the audience raved when she impersonated @entity194 's mother 's voice , and when she told a story about getting her makeup removed following the day of shooting this season 's @entity274 episode			1
getting off all that blue @entity277 makeup required some hot towels and the work of @entity266 's regular makeup artist and two assistants , both of whom were men			0
" it was getting late , and i 'm starting to fall asleep , " @entity266 recalled , " and i lifted my legs up to get the rest of the makeup off and heard the guy laugh and thought , ' oh , they 're just telling jokes			0
' but then i looked in the mirror and thought , ' what 's that ? ! dear lord @entity294 , that 's my business ! ' i had totally exposed myself ! i put my legs down and just said to them , ' long night ! ' that is the tale of my @entity298 ! " 10			0
where did ' bazinga ' come from ? @entity112 's catchphrase now beloved by fans and nerdy t - shirt companies everywhere got its start as now - showrunner @entity56 's catchphrase			1
@entity202 told the audience that during the show 's second season , @entity56 would use the word to mean " gotcha " when he pulled a trick on a fellow writer			1
a " bazinga " was in order , for example , when @entity56 gave @entity202 a grapefruit that turned out to be hollowed out then carefully taped back together			0
and that 's how the catchphrase of smug , trickster @entity112 was born			0
