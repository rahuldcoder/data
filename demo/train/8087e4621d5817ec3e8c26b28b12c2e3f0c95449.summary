-- i am extremely blessed			0
my unborn son , @entity2 , is due just before @entity3 this year			0
his pending birth motivated me to get an annual physical six months ago , a checkup i had avoided for three years			2
when my physician , dr. @entity6 , asked whether i wanted a prostate - specific antigen test , i agreed , despite the $ 150 out - of - pocket charge			1
the @entity9 advises against routine prostate cancer screenings			1
the debate over the necessity of these tests is ongoing in research labs and doctor 's offices across @entity17			0
despite the controversy , a good friend of mine , who also happens to be a doctor , told me to always have my @entity23 levels screened after age 40			1
his belief is that there are still many men who are diagnosed in their 40s and that if executive health programs include the @entity23 test for men beginning at that age , then the test should be done , regardless of government guidelines and / or family history of cancer			1
prostate cancer screening remains common my @entity23 test results were higher than normal , not indicating certain cancer but suggesting the need for a biopsy , which i chose to do right away			1
it was an ordinary workday when i got a call from dr. @entity44			0
i tried joking about his @entity46 aftershave but was cut short : my biopsy results had come back positive for high - risk prostate cancer			1
i 'm a 47 - year - old husband and father of one -- with another on the way -- and the results came as a complete shock			2
i had no symptoms , and up until this point , i thought i was healthy as a horse			0
how was i going to tell my pregnant wife that i had prostate cancer ? after tests , blood draws and ct scans , my urologist , dr. @entity61 , told me that my cancer was localized , and we scheduled my da vinci prostatectomy -- a minimally invasive treatment for prostate cancer in which the surgeon uses a " robot " as the vehicle to remove the prostate			1
my incredible team of doctors diagnosed the cancer so early and did such an expert job removing my prostate that i did n't need any additional cancer treatment			2
i was cancer - free			0
this @entity3 , i urge dads everywhere to schedule an annual checkup			2
the dads i know are always there for their families -- sometimes , at the expense of their own health			0
the men i know do n't like talking about doctors and checkups , especially when it comes to an illness that can profoundly affect their masculinity			0
i 'm hoping that by sharing my story , i can change perceptions about prostate cancer and reinforce the fact that we are all responsible for our own well - being			1
in my case , if i had n't visited my doctor six months ago for an annual checkup , i believe that i would not have as many @entity105 's days to spend with my wonderful family and new son .			0
