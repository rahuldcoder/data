there 's something addictive about that moment when you hand someone a homemade treat and that person 's face lights up as if you 've just given him or her a hug			1
it turns baking into therapy , food into an olive branch and those you share it with into a family			2
i 've experienced that joy for many years , by virtue of being the delivery girl every winter			2
i may have switched from wearing hair bows and @entity23 dresses to newsboy caps and tall boots , but that feeling stays the same , and i always come bearing gifts			2
ever since i can remember , december is when my mother takes to the kitchen like a magician and begins to turn out hand - crafted happiness			1
the aroma of sweet cakes baking in the oven or candy bubbling hot in a pot on the stove greets me at the end of each day			1
the sugary sensation alone is enough to make you swoon , especially on a bitterly cold day			1
take one bite of pound cake , @entity44 toffee , pralines , baklava or sugared pecans and you know that this did n't come from the store			1
yet again , my mom has a way of making you feel as though she has baked all of the love in her heart into each treat			1
when you taste it , you know she made it with you in mind			0
opening a wax paper - lined decorative tin and popping a piece of chocolate - and pecan - coated crunchy toffee into your mouth is bliss			1
i know this for myself , but i 've heard it from others			0
over the years , the gifts have gone out to countless friends , family members , teachers , co-workers , customers and colleagues			0
my dad and i are the proud delivery folks for my mother 's creations , soaking up the good karma vibes wherever our dispensing takes us			0
every reaction just makes my day , and i collect the compliments to take home and share with my mom			0
it 's witnessing the excited expressions on my friends ' faces as they recognize the telltale shopping bags bulging with tins			1
other times , it 's handing out that extra tin i always carry " just in case " when i see someone , perhaps an acquaintance , who seems down or unhappy , and watching that person 's face transform into a beaming smile			0
one year on " delivery day , " an ice storm hit our @entity106 town and knocked out the power at my high school			0
mr. @entity110 , my @entity44 teacher ( and oracle ) , was without a lunch , but he feasted on the treats all day			1
although he had a little bit of a sugar buzz , i 'll never forget the utter contentment on his face as he sat munching toffee and pound cake in between and during classes , a @entity115 cap sitting jauntily on his head			1
it is , somehow , a perfect memory			0
my mother has been making people feel this way for at least 25 years			1
and luckily , she has taught me the same recipes , so i can spread a similar joy			0
the woman has mastered pralines and sugared pecans , finicky candies that can so easily set up like cement without an intrepid hand to control the process			0
and a few years ago , she decided to take on a new challenge : @entity44 toffee			1
now when i say challenge , i mean this in relation to a woman who is fearless in the kitchen			0
at 6 years old , she was standing on a kitchen chair over the stove and trying to make candy with half of the things she needed			1
if she had three of the required ingredients , she was " going for it			0
" no amount of failure deterred her , and to this day , i 've never seen anyone so tenacious			0
these days , my mom churns out batches of her own recipe for @entity44 toffee without a second thought			1
so when i tell you not to fear making toffee , or any candy , it comes with the reassurance and tips provided by " the magician			1
" do n't let the list of instructions intimidate you -- it 's to be sure you 've got all you need to know ! make it one time and you 'll feel like a pro , and an excellent gift - giver			1
screw your courage to the sticking place and take up the challenge to defy expectations of sub-par gifts or gift cards with delightful homemade treats			1
@entity183 ( makes almost 3 ½ pounds ) ingredients : ½ cup water 2 teaspoons of butter , melted , to brush foil 2 cups sugar 2 tablespoons light corn syrup ( this makes the texture less like peanut brittle ) 1 teaspoon salt ( if using unsalted butter ) 3 cups chopped pecans 12 ounces milk chocolate chips 6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips 1 pound of unsalted butter , or 1 pound of lightly salted butter if opting out of the salt tools to make it easier on yourself : candy thermometer double boiler heavy - bottomed medium saucepan two ¼ - inch , 15 " x 20 " plywood boards pizza cutter wide heavy - duty aluminum foil instructions : 1			1
tear off 23 " in length of 18 " - wide , heavy - duty aluminum foil and brush the matte , non-shiny side with melted butter			1
fold 2 ½ " on each side , forming a makeshift pan			0
this should leave you with a 13 " x 18 " surface on which to pour the hot toffee			1
this fits perfectly on the plywood with some room around the edges			0
this will function as your " pan " for the toffee			1
an actual pan keeps in the heat , which does n't allow the toffee to set up as quickly			1
the board will also keep the hot candy from scorching your work surface			1
stir together the ½ cup water and corn syrup			0
pour this mixture into a medium heavy - bottomed saucepan			1
add sugar and butter and clip your candy thermometer to the side of the pan before it gets hot			2
turn on the heat to medium high , stirring constantly			2
while this is cooking -- it should take a while to reach 310 degrees @entity252 -- put ½ " of water in the bottom component of the double boiler and turn it on low			1
pour your chocolate chips into the top component and melt chocolate			0
once the chocolate is melted , turn it off and it 's ready to spread on the toffee			1
chop pecans and have them ready to sprinkle on the finished toffee			2
the candy is going to start bubbling and thickening , and eventually turn a caramel color , until it reaches 310 degrees ( the " hard crack stage " in candy making )			1
when it reaches that temperature , remove from heat immediately			0
carefully pour candy onto foil evenly			2
if need be , you can grip the plywood base to tilt it in the right direction if it does n't spread			0
if you use these exact measurements , wait 4 - 5 minutes before cutting the toffee			1
if you use a smaller space , you will need more time for the candy to cool			2
using a pizza cutter ( blunt is best ; sharp will go through the foil , but if all you have is a sharp pizza cutter , use a light hand ) , run through the toffee length and width to create 1 ½ - inch squares			1
( if your pizza cutter does n't leave an impression , it 's still too warm and you might want to wait another minute before trying again )			0
this will help the toffee to break later , rather than forming definite squares			2
after cutting , lift the top part of double boiler off and dry the bottom of it so it does n't drip onto the candy			2
take a spatula and spread a thin layer of chocolate over the top of the toffee			2
you can use just enough to cover the surface , but thickness is up to personal preference			0
@entity311 sprinkle the chopped pecans on top of the melted chocolate			0
place an unbuttered sheet of foil on top of the toffee and tuck foil around edges			2
place your second board of plywood on top and flip it over			0
after flipping , remove the top board and let sit for 1 - 2 minutes before you remove foil			2
if you peel the foil and it starts to stick , wait another minute and it should come off			0
once you peel off the foil , repeat the chocolate and nut process			0
cover this with another piece of foil and the second plywood board , and flip it over again			0
remove the top piece of foil and , retaining the bottom piece of foil , slide it off of the board and onto a wire cooling rack			0
sit the wire rack in the coolest room of your house			0
the toffee needs to cool for at least a few hours			2
after it is cool , break the toffee into pieces			2
it usually breaks where the pizza cutter went through			0
if it is n't breaking into even pieces , it does n't matter			0
store the toffee in wax paper - lined tins at room temperature and it will keep for weeks .			1
