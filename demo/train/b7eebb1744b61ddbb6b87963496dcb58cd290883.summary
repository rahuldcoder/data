-- the attorney for @entity2 says he is confident his motion to have a @entity5 judge removed from his client 's case will be granted			1
" i think she 's going to go ahead and grant it and move the case on to another judge , " @entity8 , the lawyer , said monday night			1
@entity2 's defense team formally requested monday that @entity15 circuit judge @entity14 , the @entity5 judge assigned to their client 's case , be removed after she revealed her husband works with a @entity0 legal analyst			1
@entity8 's office filed paperwork monday asking that @entity14 not preside over second - degree murder proceedings involving @entity2 and the motion to " disqualify " the trial judge " will be ruled on in the appropriate manner , " a court official said			1
@entity2 , a 28 - year - old neighborhood watch volunteer , fatally shot teenager @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity5 , february 26 , a killing he has said was in self - defense			2
since then , the case has stirred civil rights activists nationwide and drawn intense publicity			0
@entity34 : guns , not race , key issue in @entity27 case @entity14 is assigned to the @entity2 case			1
but on friday , she said she would entertain motions to disqualify her from the trial because her husband is a law partner of @entity40 , an attorney whom @entity2 approached about representing him and has since widely commented on the case in the media			1
@entity40 is now a @entity0 contributor , providing analysis on this case			1
@entity40 told @entity0 that @entity2 " contacted my office , attempting to reach me , and wanted to hire me to represent him " on march 13			1
one of his law partners relayed that request to @entity40 , who declined			0
he explained later that he knew how taking on " big national cases ( can ) take a lot out of you " and wanted to have more time to spend with his children			0
" i decided simply not to , " the @entity55 lawyer said			0
a friend of @entity2 's later repeated the request in a direct conversation with @entity40 early last week , just as lawyers @entity59 and @entity61 said they 'd no longer represent @entity2			2
by then , @entity40 noted he 'd been hired by @entity0 to serve as an analyst			1
@entity40 again said he could not represent @entity2 and offered the names of five lawyers -- topped by @entity8 -- who might be considered instead			1
" they said @entity8 is the one we want , i put them together , and they took it from there , " said @entity40			2
he acknowledged tuesday , " it 's an appearance of a conflict , an appearance of an impropriety " for @entity14 to preside over the case			0
but , he said he thought she did nothing improper by waiting for a request from attorneys instead of offering to recuse herself first			0
" i do n't think she did anything out of the ordinary for this extraordinary situation , " he said			0
meanwhile , news media organizations , including @entity0 , petitioned @entity85 monday to reverse an order sealing court records in @entity2 's prosecution			1
prosecutors did not object when @entity2 's attorneys asked @entity14 to seal records last week			2
the judge ordered the court filings and other records sealed " without giving the public and press an opportunity to oppose closure , " the media said in its motion			0
@entity5 law requires a judge to consider whether the records closure is needed to " prevent a serious and imminent threat " to justice , the media members argued			0
the court must also find that there is no alternative to sealing the records that would provide a fair trial and that the action would not be " broader than necessary to accomplish this purpose , " they said			0
older brother : @entity27 was a happy teen in addition to @entity0 , several broadcasting and newspaper companies -- including the publishers of @entity117 , the @entity118 and the @entity119 -- are part of the effort to unseal the documents			2
@entity8 said monday that he favors keeping documents sealed in this case in large part because of concerns that witnesses might be contacted and in danger if certain information is released			1
" ( @entity132 ) overall philosophy ( is ) to keep the information flow concentrated within the court system , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's much better handled there			0
" as to his client , @entity8 said he speaks " at least a couple times a day " with @entity2 , whom he described as doing well physically but " frightened			1
" @entity2 is scheduled to return to court friday for a bail hearing			0
@entity8 says he hopes his client will be eligible for bond after that hearing and eventually be allowed to go free until the trial			2
if he does get out , though , the lawyer said there are legitimate fears about @entity2 's safety			0
" there have been a lot of emotions that have come forward in this case , and some of those emotions have shown themselves in bad ways , " @entity8 said .			2

the judge in the case is *connected* to a @entity0 analyst
@entity8 describes his client , @entity2 , as " frightened "
media outlets are asking that documents in the case be unsealed
