@entity0 -- when @entity5 ditched in the @entity6 and all of its 150 passengers and five crew members were safely rescued in january , the landing of the airplane by pilot @entity4 was quickly proclaimed the " @entity5 " and dominated national news for days			1
a pilot who virtually grew up in airplane cockpits , writer @entity12 set out to analyze what happened in the five - minute flight of @entity5 , which lost power in both engines when it collided with a flock of @entity21 geese			1
his conclusion after writing a new book " @entity25 " -- there was no miracle			1
" i 'm sure mr. @entity4 himself would n't have used that word , " @entity12 said in an interview with @entity1			1
" there was no miracle			1
there was extremely skillful flying going on and skillful engineering in the background			1
you can include the flight attendants and the passengers			2
... there was a lot of altruism , kind of a bravery , soberness			2
they were not hysterical , and there was no stampeding			2
" many good things happened , but they all related to the individual strength of the people involved			2
that includes [ @entity52 ] @entity51 [ the designer of the aircraft ] , @entity4 , [ co-pilot @entity54 ] @entity55 and @entity56 , the air traffic controller -- he was as good as it gets , offering alternatives , the backing off of alternatives , staying cool			2
" @entity12 , international editor for @entity62 and author of six other books , was drawn to the story because it allowed him to use it as a window to tell the tale of the aircraft , the @entity71 , a controversial plane built with digital controls that rein in pilots who exceed safe flying limits			1
" within the limits of physics and structural science , " @entity12 writes , " @entity51 and his colleagues identified the wrinkles of conventional handling and mostly ironed them out			1
the result in the @entity71 is the product of a genius -- an airplane that is ... exquisitely wrought , a delight to handle , and extraordinarily easy to fly			1
" it also allowed @entity12 to describe the economic squeeze that has affected pilots as airlines have come under tremendous pressure to lower fares and reduce costs			1
just one example described in the book -- @entity4 had seen his salary cut 40 percent and his retirement pension destroyed through airline bankruptcies and cutbacks			2
@entity4 , for his part , has been critical of @entity12 's book , saying it makes too much of the aircraft 's automation			1
in an interview with the @entity106 , @entity4 said , " there are some situations where the automation will protect a pilot , but at the same time a highly automated airplane makes possible other types of errors , so it 's a mixed blessing			2
and greater knowledge is required to fly a highly automated aircraft			2
" @entity1 spoke with @entity12 this week			1
@entity1 : what got you interested in the story ? @entity12 : i realized that because this airplane is the @entity71 , which is a revolutionary plane , not just any airplane , the story of the @entity71 is in many ways the story of the modern airline industry of the last 20 , 30 or 40 years			1
@entity1 : how did you become a pilot ? @entity12 : my father was a well - known aviator and writer			1
i got my first flying job when i was 18 ; i worked my way through college flying airplanes			2
my father was a @entity134 immigrant , an anti-nazi who came here before the beginning of the war ... who became a test pilot for the @entity138			2
@entity1 : what 's it like to fly an @entity71 ? @entity12 : it all relates to flight control characteristics and how the stick feels in your hand			1
... the attitude or the pitch of the airplane stays where you put it , it 's an airplane that responds in an extremely docile manner to the control stick when it 's flown by hand			2
... the airplane was very controversial in the early 1980s , especially in @entity156			1
the unions really resented it ; it was because of flight envelope protections that kick in when the plane goes where a normal airline pilot will never go			1
... the airplane will take over , and it will override the pilot , and philosophically that 's a really provocative thing to do			0
@entity1 : did the flight envelope protection kick in during the landing in the @entity6 ? @entity12 : it was sort of a normal flight until the challenge of the flare itself , when the nose rises just before touchdown , that was a different flare for various reasons			1
for one thing it was done with no power , no thrust			0
... also the landing gear was up			1
so at the very end in the flare , in the last two seconds or three seconds , it went into alpha protection , it got into the protection zone			0
the airplane lowered its own nose			0
it happened so late in the flare that my gut feeling is that it was kind of irrelevant , that the inertia of the airplane was going to dominate the landing and so it probably does n't matter			1
@entity1 : @entity4 's flying ability was widely praised			0
was that justified ? @entity12 : of course , it 's justified			1
the thing that was most important about it was the concentration he brought -- the intense concentration on what was important			0
other people could have been distracted			0
it did n't happen in this case			0
he was intensely focused on making the right decision			0
@entity1 : what was the most important decision he made ? @entity12 : the decision he made to go into the water as opposed to trying to return to @entity210 [ @entity211 ]			1
while in most simulations conducted after the fact , pilots were able to get back to the airport safely , he made the right decision			1
in the real world , that would have been an unacceptable crapshoot			0
obviously , calling it a miracle is silly			2
in a way to use the word miracle is to insult what they did -- skilled flying in an extremely competent airplane			2
@entity1 : why was the @entity71 so controversial ? @entity12 : the role of the pilot had been downsized			1
and with deregulation , the salary of the pilot had been downsized			0
so when this technology came in it was kind of coming in in that context			0
that 's why the @entity156 saw it as such an attack on their professional future			1
there had also been a global shift in the industry to two - pilot crews			0
the flight engineer position had been eliminated through automation			0
the emotions that this airplane produced still linger			0
no one 's going to be flying pilotless airliners anytime soon			0
it 's technically possible , and the @entity251 flies drones in @entity253 ... but obviously that 's not the future of airlines in a dense traffic world with the public aboard			0
@entity1 : is automation the reason for the downsizing of pilots ? @entity12 : we 're not looking at technology as the reason for the decline of pilots			1
it 's because of deregulation			0
the public demands cheap tickets			0
there was a time , a glorious interval , when airline pilots were paid a lot of money and there was still prestige associated with the job ... but after deregulation everything changed			2
@entity1 : how important is the pilot to safety ? @entity12 : pilots , of course , are central			1
without the pilot , forget about it			0
the aircraft 's not going to land itself on the @entity6			0
in day - to - day operations the pilot is central to flight safety -- the relationship between that and salary is a whole different question			0
@entity1 : should people be concerned about the effect of the lower salaries ? @entity12 : if you look at new pilots coming in now , these guys are as competent as the older guys , and they 're being paid a lot less money			1
the standard correlation between how much you 're paid and how good you are , i would question that			0
@entity1 : the book quotes a @entity311 study of the most lethal 50 percent of @entity251 airline accidents from 1983 through 2000			0
it found that 86 percent of the occupants survived			0
would n't most people find that surprising ? @entity12 : the problem is that the accidents that get the most attention are the ones that kill the most people -- with this one being an exception			1
@entity1 : what advice do you have for maximizing your chances of survival ? @entity12 : this thing we hear so repetitively -- it 's actually the safety briefing on a plane , which is probably a pretty good guide to it			1
where are the exits , how do the life rafts work ; it 's probably all a passenger needs to know			0
and by the way , airline accidents are very , very rare			0
let 's face it , airlines are extremely safe , specifically because of the contributions of the people involved in this success story -- the pilots , the engineers , the flight controllers , the flight attendants			1
these are the agents of the public 's safety at work			0
@entity1 : @entity4 has criticized your book , saying it places too much emphasis on the plane 's automated systems			2
@entity12 : there 's no quarrel at all			1
the book elevates legitimately and correctly what mr. @entity4 and mr. @entity55 did as pilots			2
... without those two pilots in the cockpit , doing the job they did , people would not have survived			2
clearly , they were flying a fly - by - wire airplane , and that 's part of the story			0
i never imply that , had they been flying a 737 , things would have been worse			0
that would be highly speculative and silly			0
i 'm writing about what did happen			0
there 's no argument here from my side .			0

the safe landing of @entity5 was hailed as the " @entity5 "
author @entity12 says there was no miracle
author says the skill of the crew , engineering of the plane made a difference
@entity12 : @entity71 is controversial , especially with @entity156 pilots
