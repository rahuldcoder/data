dear world : @entity2 is actually not " flawless			1
the posting of what appear to be unretouched photos of @entity2 poked the @entity7 ( as her die - hard fans are known )			1
in the photos @entity2 's skin is blemished and hardly the smooth , cover girl look usually presented			1
in other words , @entity2 is ( gasp ) human			1
but why should we even care ? as @entity16 wrote in @entity17 : " the most obvious explanation is that humans enjoy living vicariously through those of our species who are richer , more famous , attractive , and sexually desirable than the rest of us			2
" " whether couched in terms of envy , admiration , or derision , celebrity fascination begins as an exercise in imaging what it would be like to lead a more carefree and pleasurable life , " he wrote			2
" the flip side of the fantasy of irresponsible fabulosity is schadenfreude — the pleasure we take in the misfortune of others			2
" which is why celeb watchers have by turns praised and derided the photos of @entity2			1
a stunning woman , the singer is still attractive in the images			2
and yet there are those who question whether the photographs are even legitimate			2
forget the birthers ; the @entity49 are not having it			0
the response to @entity51 deviated from the cries of women 's empowerment that followed a recently released image of supermodel @entity56 from a 2013 photo shoot for @entity58 and @entity59			1
the picture shows @entity62 sporting imperfections , including cellulite			1
fans rallied around the model and praised her for letting it all hang out , despite the fact that @entity62 appears to have had nothing to do with the release of the picture			1
her husband , @entity71 , posted a much more flattering @entity73 's shot of his wife looking toned in a two - piece bathing suit -- seemingly in response to the hoopla			0
not so fast says @entity78 of @entity79			0
@entity80 finds the celebration of @entity62 's " empowering " photo to be a bit disingenuous			1
" for one , the standard that we commend the model for smashing with the unretouched photo is the very same standard we use to shame celebrities like @entity89 and @entity90 for daring to change their looks , " @entity80 wrote			1
" the standard that equates beauty and dignity in the realm of aging			0
if a woman does n't ' age gracefully ' or if it 's clear she 's had ' work done , ' accusations of weak character and ' clinging desperately to youth ' are suddenly fair game			0
" yes , that 's really @entity89 while " stars , they 're just like us ! " may be a popular franchise for tabloids that also love to post features on celebs without makeup , it would appear that the famous are not allowed to actually be regular people			0
after all , regular people are n't as admired as celebs			0
" part of our curiosity is a way of learning what makes the great great in our own search for knowledge , fame and fortune , " author @entity116 wrote in a blog post about our fascination with celebrities for @entity121			0
" we copy the famous , buy dresses that are similar or even the same , we wear our hair the way our idol does in an attempt to capture the glamor we admire			0
" but at least some fans are pleased with catching a less - refined glimpse of a star who is known for having a tightly controlled image and whose publicist reportedly once demanded that unflattering pictures of the artist from her @entity145 half - time performance be removed .			0
