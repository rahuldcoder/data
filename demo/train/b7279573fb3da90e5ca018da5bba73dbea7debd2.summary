-- deciding when to upgrade is a funny , sometimes expensive thing			2
carrier contracts that subsidize the cost of a new @entity4 are usually for two years , so it 's traditional to upgrade every other model or less			1
you also want to time it just right , during the @entity4 development cycle , so you do n't buy a phone months before it 's outdated			1
if you are an @entity4 owner who is pondering an upgrade to the new @entity4 , here are some things to consider : do you long for more screen space / watch a lot of movies ? perhaps you 've heard that the @entity4 is taller			1
after testing its tallness we 've found that there is more space on the screen , which is no longer as short as the previous @entity4 screens			1
the phone retains its width but is now 9 millimeters taller -- that 's one extra row of icons			1
the dimensions are perfect for watching widescreen movies , which were previously smaller and letter - boxed			1
the space also gives all other apps a bit more breathing room			2
third - party applications must now redesign their apps to fix the new aspect ratio -- which requires time and resources -- so until then , older apps will be shown at normal size , the bar of unused screen space cloaked in mourning - black			1
there is a market for much larger smartphone screens , and companies like @entity49 have delivered with spacious , high - resolution smartphones			0
this is largely a matter of preference , but if you find that the @entity4 's screen is still just too small for you , you may need to defect to something like the @entity56 which has a 4.8 - inch screen			1
does your current phone feel slow ? each @entity4 is typically faster than its predecessor , and phones tend to slow down over time			1
@entity61 has added a speedier processor to the @entity4 in the form of an @entity65 chip			1
the company claims it is up to twice as fast , and after testing , the difference is definitely noticeable			0
holding on to a slightly slower @entity4 might not be much of an issue if you primarily use it for common tasks -- calls and texts , e-mailing , @entity75 and @entity76 , reading , even watching movies			1
if you do n't find yourself grumbling at how slow your phone is , and you 're still reeling from the speed improvements over the last @entity4 you bought , you can probably carry on blissfully unaware of the difference			1
however , if you use your @entity4 for bigger tasks like playing graphic games , the speed is a very welcome bump indeed			1
another place it 's a noticeable improvement is the camera ( more on that in a moment )			2
there are also free steps you can take to try and speed up your current phone			2
free up some hard drive space by uninstalling apps you never use , emptying @entity97 's cache and clearing out photos , videos and music ( see exactly what 's taking up space in settings - > general - > usage )			1
make sure you regularly close any apps running in the background			2
is your @entity4 your primary camera ? thanks to decent image quality and the ability to share photos and videos instantly , the @entity4 is probably more popular as a camera than a telephoning device			1
the @entity4 has the same 8 - megapixel camera sensor as the @entity115 , but @entity61 did make a few hardware tweaks to make it fit into the thinner body and to improve image quality			1
the best camera improvement is actually just plain old speed			2
you can take rapid - fire shots as fast as your finger can tap on the shutter button			0
tapping to focus is instant			0
for anyone who has ever missed a moment because of the @entity4 's lagging trigger , this is just awesome			1
@entity61 added a new panorama feature to the @entity129 app , and while there are numerous third - party panorama apps available , such as @entity134 's @entity133 , the @entity61 feature manages to beat them at their own game			1
the stitching is both faster and higher quality than competitors , and the final image is higher resolution			0
other adjustments to the camera include improved low - light images and reduced noise			0
do you use your phone for navigation ? if so , there is a slight caveat			0
every @entity4 release comes with its own bit of drama			1
sometimes it 's overblown , like @entity154 , when holding your case-less phone in a very specific position could cause it to drop calls			0
@entity115 users reported battery issues			0
for the @entity4 , the issue de jour is its new maps app. every @entity4 comes with @entity162 pre-installed			1
that means the old maps app is automatically out , replaced with @entity61 's first go at a map application			0
it adds turn - by - turn directions and nice 3d graphics , but drops transit directions and decreases accuracy			0
@entity61 has always excelled at design and smart user interfaces , but it is not a data company			0
while it continues to work to make this app what it should be , the best solution is to wait for @entity178 to release its own third - party maps app for @entity162			0
( the company is mum on when exactly that will be , but it will probably happen soon			0
) in the meantime , there are many other map apps in the @entity185 , and you can still access @entity178 's service through @entity97 , though the experience is slower and less intuitive			1
do you like beautiful things ? the most impressive part of the new @entity4 is its design			2
@entity61 is comparing the level of construction to a " finely crafted watch			0
" like a luxury item , its design is impeccable , the attention to detail visible on every seam and surface			0
not everyone integrates their @entity4 into an outfit like a @entity203			2
if you are one of the many people who protect their iphone with an opaque case , the details wo n't be visible to people around you			0
in that situation , you still get the satisfaction of a well - made device , but previous iphones were also finely crafted and are still in perfectly good shape			0
the most dramatic physical difference of the new phone is that it is thinner and lighter			0
but while a great overall improvement , that 's not enough of a reason to warrant upgrading unless you find yourself constantly bemoaning how heavy and fat your existing phone is			2
if you wear skinny jeans , this might be the one upgrade you were waiting for			0
do you have anything older than an @entity115 ? if you have an @entity227 or earlier , upgrade			1
do it for the screen			0
the retina display introduced on the @entity232 has been further refined for the @entity4 and in side - by - side comparisons with all screens at full brightness , the colors do look more vivid on the @entity4			2
if you have an @entity232 , the decision is harder			2
consider what new features you really need			0
if you would get a lot of use out of the @entity244 voice - assistant , for example , this is a good time to upgrade			0
if you are a hardcore mobile gamer or serious @entity4 photographer , the speed is worth it			1
but if you find that your two - year - old , well - crafted @entity4 is holding up nicely , perhaps stick it out for another year			2
@entity115 owners should just relax and enjoy their current phones			0
wait a year for the next iteration , when your carrier will offer you the upgrade at the subsidized price and all the @entity4 owners will suddenly be stuck with old technology .			1

the @entity4 's speed is a significant upgrade for gamers and photographers
the new , taller screen size is perfect for widescreen movies , but many apps do n't fit the new size yet
owners of @entity227 and older models should definitely consider upgrading
decision is harder for owners of later models
