-- the art of dodging tossed wedding bouquets had been mastered by @entity3			1
at 52 , and with plenty of experience celebrating the big day for others , she 'd learned how to back into corners and disappear when brides sent those flowers flying			1
@entity3 , left , and @entity10 celebrate their engagement at the @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity16 parade			1
now , @entity3 can dive for them			2
" i have seven brothers and sisters , and i 've been to all of their weddings , " she said , her words catching on emotion			0
" it 's just something you never thought you 'd get to do			1
" everything changed for this @entity28 nurse on april 3 , when the @entity31 state 's @entity29 unanimously ruled to overturn a ban on same - sex marriages			1
on that day , @entity3 proposed to @entity10 , her partner of 10 years -- three times , just because she could			0
by lunchtime , the two women were busy planning their wedding , a big blowout scheduled for next summer			2
forty years after the @entity41 riots in @entity42 -- the june 28 , 1969 , demonstrations that marked the beginning of the gay rights movement -- @entity14 stands as one of six @entity48 states to have legalized same - sex marriages			1
the others that currently , or will soon , perform such unions are @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
many activists who followed the @entity14 case , @entity59 , to the state 's @entity29 were anticipating the april 3 announcement			1
but for @entity63 , news of the decision on television that morning -- " between ' @entity67 ' and ' @entity68 , ' " he said -- came as a complete shock			0
" how did this happen ? " the @entity13 designer and event planner remembers thinking before turning the station to compare newscasts			0
" are you kidding me , universe ? " and then , while resisting the urge to pinch himself , the revelation : " @entity81			0
i could be a gay wedding planner			2
" he and others like him should be plenty busy			0
according to a study conducted by @entity85 , a @entity87 - based think tank that researches sexual orientation law and policy , more than 2,900 of the state 's same - sex couples will marry within three years and nearly 55,000 out - of - state couples may flock to @entity14 for the honor			1
@entity63 , who established @entity94 with @entity95 , was n't the only one who realized the potential of this new nuptials niche			1
web sites offering resource guides to help happy couples ( in - state and out ) sprouted up , bearing names such as @entity14 's @entity105 and @entity106			1
and wedding officiants , including those who 'd been ordained online , began publicizing their same - sex - friendly services			1
@entity13 ' first annual @entity110 , held at a downtown hotel earlier this month , was organized by @entity63 and brought together 40 vendors ready and willing to help couples realize their dream day			2
it was there that @entity3 and @entity10 found , for example , their photographer and realized they 'd have " like 106 flavors of cake to choose from , " @entity3 said with the laugh of an overwhelmed bride - to - be			1
wedding vendors again came out in force just over a week ago at the 31st annual @entity16 , a @entity13 event organized by @entity128 that attracted a record crowd of more than 10,000 , officials estimated			1
jubilant couples carried signs of gratitude and announcements of " just married			0
" for @entity135 , who was adopted at 8 by @entity136 and @entity137 of @entity138 , the @entity29 decision finally gives her parents -- together for 28 years -- what she 's wanted for them since she was 10			2
the two men already had a civil ceremony , and later this summer , they 'll receive a blessing in their @entity144			0
" now they can do what my husband and i did , " said @entity135 , 26 , a teaching assistant in @entity145 , @entity146			0
" and i get to have the privilege to walk my parents down the aisle			0
" not everyone in @entity28 , however , is feeling the love			0
those associated with the @entity156 , for example , are crisscrossing the state to promote the faith - based organization 's mission that reads , in part , " to restore and defend traditional moral principles			1
" @entity163 , a spokesman for the center , said the @entity165 overstepped its bounds , did what only the legislature can do and does not have " the constitutional authority to alter laws or write laws			0
" he said that these same - sex marriages are , therefore , not legal and that @entity173 should continue to make their opinions known			1
" if we 're not going to base the rule of law on the @entity177 , and we 're not going to look to the @entity178 as a foundation of truth , " @entity163 said , " what standard are we going to use ? " state sen. @entity182 , @entity183 , also has made his opposition known			2
he said he pushed , unsuccessfully , to institute a " conscience clause " -- a measure that would allow county recorders the right to refuse same - sex marriage licenses			1
@entity182 feels @entity14 was " hand picked " by outside advocates -- @entity192 , a national organization , filed the @entity14 suit -- as fertile ground for a handful of reasons			1
among those he mentioned were @entity14 's current @entity200 leadership and the fact that it does n't have a ballot initiative option , which is what allowed @entity204 to vote for @entity205 , the measure that banned same - sex marriages in that state			1
he said that he hopes the 2010 elections will change the tide and that the ruling does n't reflect what @entity173 truly want			0
not so , said @entity213 , executive director of @entity14 , a statewide grassroots advocacy and education organization for the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender communities			1
she said that in measuring public opinion , she keeps hearing how " proud " iowans are , and she emphasized that the state , often written off as a " flyover state or conservative state , " in fact , has a long history of civil rights leadership			2
@entity14 , for example , ruled against slavery in 1839 , desegregated schools in 1868 and , for the first time in the country , granted a woman a license to practice law in 1869 , as outlined in a one @entity14 brochure			2
but beyond this tradition and what she described as a " strong sense of community and fairness , " she said most @entity173 realize that that vows taken by two people wo n't affect their day - to - day lives and that they have other , more pressing concerns , especially in these tough financial times			2
doing their own part to help @entity28 's economy are @entity3 and @entity10 , 47 , who works with medically and physically challenged adults			2
while others may be steeped in the bigger picture , they 've got a " growing and growing " guest list to worry about , decisions on bridal wear to make and party add - ons -- photo booth , or no photo booth ? -- to consider			0
and with two brides making decisions , @entity3 said , things can get complicated			0
when @entity10 mentioned the idea of having the party at an @entity263 lodge , @entity3 raced out the door with a down payment for the country club			0
but on june 5 , 2010 , these two @entity268 , @entity28 , women will embark on a life as one when they say their vows and promise to love each other always			0
a white carriage , complete with a " just married " sign and pulled by black horses , will ferry them all the way through town and to the reception			0
" it 's a long journey , " @entity3 said , " to symbolize our struggle			0

instead of dodging wedding bouquets , @entity14 's same - sex brides can dive for them
the state 's high court overturned a ban on same - sex marriages on april 3
a new nuptials niche opens up for businesses , drawing vendors to @entity16
" it 's just something you never thought you 'd get to do , " one bride - to - be says
