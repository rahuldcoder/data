-- former @entity2 president gen. @entity1 defended @entity2 's role in the fight against terrorism amid criticisms that it falls short on that front			1
" @entity2 has always been accused of not doing enough			1
but i totally disagree with this statement			0
@entity2 is doing enough , " @entity1 said in an interview that aired sunday on @entity13 's " @entity12			1
" a private @entity15 report to @entity16 , obtained by @entity0 last week , used unusually tough language to suggest the ally is not doing nearly enough to confront the @entity19 and @entity20			0
the blunt language contradicted public comments by the @entity24 administration that @entity2 is working hard to crack down on militants			2
the report notes that from march to june , the @entity2 military " continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with @entity29 @entity19 or [ @entity20 ] forces in @entity31			1
this is as much a political choice as it is a reflection of an under - resourced military prioritizing its targets			0
" @entity1 said that if critics want to point out deficiencies in @entity31 , they should limit their comments to just that region			2
" but do n't generalize the statement that the army is not doing enough			0
they 've suffered over 2,000 casualties			0
what do you mean by not doing enough ? " he said			0
@entity2 has its problems , he said , but should not be blamed for its effort			2
" we must understand the problems , but what hurts @entity2 and every leader in @entity2 is when they are blamed			2
everyone in the world starts blaming them , while we are suffering casualties , we are suffering hundreds of people dying from bomb blasts and suicide bombs , and yet we are the rogues , " @entity1 said			0
@entity1 has been in self - imposed exile in @entity64 since he left office in 2008			1
but he said he wants to return for a presidential run in 2013 , because he sees suffering in @entity2 and does n't see a political party offering a solution .			1

the @entity2 military is " doing enough " to fight terrorism , @entity1 says
@entity1 was president until 2008
he intends on running again in 2013
