@entity1 , @entity0 -- they built it , but the shoppers did n't come			1
new @entity6 in @entity7 opened in 2005			1
with 5 million square feet of shopping area , the mall can accommodate 2,350 stores , making it the largest shopping center in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of @entity16 , the biggest shopping center in the @entity17			1
at the outdoor plaza , hundreds of palm - trees blend with a replica @entity20 , a giant @entity23 sphinx , fountains and long - stretching canals with gondolas			0
only problem is , the mall is virtually deserted			2
despite the bombastic design and grand plans , only a handful of stores are occupied			0
" most of it empty , with little consumer traffic and a high vacancy rate , " according to a report last year by @entity37 , a global building data firm			1
" it has been classified as a ' dead mall			1
' " walking among shattered shops -- its dusty corridors and escalators covered in soiled sheets -- is a walk through a ghost mall			1
rubbish piles up along the sides , paint is coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements have faded			2
the mall 's indoor amusement park , staff lay half asleep over counters or kill time chatting with each other while the 1,814 - foot rollercoaster roars above			1
opened for the public in 2005 , developers expected to attract some 100,000 visitors a day			2
but eight years later , the few people that visit the mall today typically hang out at the @entity17 fast food restaurants near the entrance or at the @entity71 cinema outside the mall			2
some parents bring their children to the @entity75			0
part of the problem is location			0
@entity1 is a factory town and most of its almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet			0
" people coming here to work in factories do n't have the time or the money for shopping or the rollercoaster , " said a migrant worker in his 20s , surnamed @entity87 , who works at the mall			2
the deserted mall is also a symbol of @entity0 's rapid urbanization and runaway investment in real estate projects , where massive development projects have been given the go ahead without proper marketing and business research			1
" to me , many of these projects are a result of easy access to capital and a combination of wishful thinking and speculative behavior rather than rational business calculations , " said @entity105 , assistant professor at the @entity106			0
" this mall is not the only one that is like that			0
elsewhere in @entity0 there is the phenomenon of ' @entity121 ' , that is to say infrastructure projects , both residential and commercial , with no takers			1
" the credit boom of post-financial crisis stimulus has resulted in a proliferation of empty commercial developments and apartments built on rampant speculation			1
yet why is the @entity0 economy still moving at a brisk 7 % to 8 % growth rate ? " what @entity0 did in the stimulus credit boom is create a lot of ` ghost cities ' : projects without a strong commercial foundation , and projects that did n't get done , " wrote @entity133 in a research note entitled " @entity135 " from @entity136 last month			1
" what happens next ? " in most of the economy ... nothing			0
you have n't created a lot of new productive capacity ; you 're not driving down profits and returns in manufacturing and services , and you 've left plenty of room for a rebound in the market - oriented property space			0
" rather , for all intents and purposes you just took the money and poured it down a black hole , " @entity133 wrote			0
and the @entity0 banking system " has surprisingly little trouble absorbing that bad debt			2
" but while the macroeconomic juggernaut of @entity0 marches on , there remain regional areas of woe			2
@entity1 is facing mounting problems as factories close down and manufacturing moves to other cities in @entity0 and abroad which offer cheaper labor			2
still , the mall has plans to boost the number of tenants , said @entity178 , head of @entity6 's investment unit			1
he claims the mall has a 20 % occupancy rate measured by commercial area , although @entity178 declined to give specifics when challenged on that number			1
the company 's goal is to increase occupancy to 80 % in 2013 , he said			0
" from march onwards we will have big promotional activities in order to reach our new leasing targets , " @entity178 said			0
it 's not the first time the owners try to blow life into the sleeping giant			0
the mall was initially headed by @entity1 native @entity198 , who became a billionaire in the instant noodle business , and later sold to the @entity201 , a conglomerate set up by @entity202			0
in a 2007 relaunch , the mall changed name from " @entity6 " to " @entity6 , @entity206 " and a revitalization plan was drawn up			1
but after the relaunch , neither shoppers nor tenants came .			0

the @entity6 in @entity7 is the world 's largest mall
but since its opening in 2005 , few tenants and *customers* have come to the store
" most of it empty , with little consumer traffic and a high vacancy rate ... a ' dead mall ' "
@entity0 littered with " ghost towns , " empty commercial spaces built in speculative boom
