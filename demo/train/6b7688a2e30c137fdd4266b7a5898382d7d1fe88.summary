-- computer hackers supporting @entity2 shifted targets thursday from @entity4 to @entity5 , they said , as @entity7 authorities announced an arrest in connection with hacker attacks on the websites of @entity12 and @entity13			1
the @entity7 high tech crimes unit arrested a 16 - year - old in @entity16 , @entity7 , with prosecutors saying he confessed to attacks on the websites			1
" he is probably part of a larger group of hackers , who are under continued investigation , " they said			2
the teen is due in court friday in @entity28			0
separately , a group of hackers calling themselves @entity31 said they would attack @entity5 , not @entity4 , about an hour after an attack on @entity4 was due to start			1
" we can not attack @entity4 , currently			1
the previous schedule was to do so , but we do n't have enough forces , " they said on @entity34			1
@entity31 released a do - it - yourself hacking tool earlier thursday so supporters could make their own computers part of the attack			0
the @entity4 attack was supposed to have started at about 11 a.m. et. so far , @entity5 appears to be operating normally			1
the site has been attacked , which has slowed it down but has " not significantly impacted payments , " @entity45 's @entity44 told @entity0			0
@entity4 has massive server capacity -- much more than that of @entity12 or @entity13 -- in order to handle the holiday e-commerce rush			1
its server infrastructure ensures that a massive traffic spike ca n't take site down , whether it comes from a hacker - led attack or genuine shoppers			0
@entity31 released the hacking tool on @entity34 and called for followers to translate it into other languages			0
hackers have been targeting websites of organizations they see as hostile to @entity2 and its editor - in - chief @entity65 , who was arrested in @entity66 this week on allegations unconnected to the website 's publication of secret documents			1
@entity4 used to host @entity2 ' website in the @entity72 , but shut it down last week , saying it had violated their terms of service by publishing material it did not own and which could cause harm			1
@entity5 stopped handling donations to @entity2 last week			1
the @entity82 @entity81 said thursday that pressure on websites to cut off @entity2 could violate the site 's right to freedom of expression			1
" i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , to close down credit lines for donations to @entity2 as well as to stop hosting the website or its mirror sites , " @entity89 said in @entity90 , @entity91 " they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , " she said at a press conference			1
" if @entity2 has committed any recognizable illegal acts , then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties			1
" @entity31 members told @entity0 thursday their goal was " freedom of information			0
" they were originally focused on piracy , but shifted their attention to @entity2 because it was " obvious we had to help			1
" " while their methods may be controversial , they do demand transparency , which is something we definitely support , " they said , adding that once they feel they have made their point about @entity2 , they will go back to fighting for " unlimited freedom of expression			1
" they spoke to @entity0 correspondent @entity134 in an online chat after being contacted through @entity34			0
@entity2 said thursday it was not associated with @entity31 and neither supported nor condemned their actions			1
" this group is not affiliated with @entity2			1
there has been no contact between any @entity2 staffer and anyone at @entity31			2
@entity2 has not received any prior notice of any of @entity31 ' actions , " it said on its website			2
" we neither condemn nor applaud these attacks			2
we believe they are a reflection of public opinion on the actions of the targets , " @entity2 spokesman @entity149 said			2
the hackers have been attacking sites with a relatively simple tool called a low orbit ion cannon ( @entity159 )			0
users who put it on their computer are allowing @entity31 to use the machine to launch attacks on a chosen target , computer security expert @entity160 told @entity0			2
he has n't seen any obvious code in the tool that would allow @entity31 to use people 's computers for other purposes , he said			0
because people cut and paste the code off a website , rather than downloading it , there 's no way to tell how many people have put the tool on their computers			0
one person who put the hacking tool on his computer told @entity0 it was the arrest of @entity65 that " sparked this global movement			0
" if he was not arrested , i doubt that the movement would have grown to its current unstoppable size , " said the computer user , who refused to give his name but said he was not a hacker			0
the website of the lawyer representing the women who accuse @entity65 of sex attacks in @entity195 went down on thursday , said the office of the lawyer , @entity197			0
the @entity199 's website was down earlier in the week			0
@entity31 told @entity0 it had carried out that attack			0
the @entity195 newspaper @entity201 reported that government 's website also went down for a few hours , but the government refused to comment , saying it did not discuss security matters			0
and a website has been set up in the name of @entity195 justice minister @entity208 -- but it automatically redirects users to @entity2			2
@entity2 founder @entity65 is being held in a @entity66 jail as the @entity212 courts decide whether to extradite him to @entity195 to face questioning			2
he has not been charged with a crime			0
@entity0 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
