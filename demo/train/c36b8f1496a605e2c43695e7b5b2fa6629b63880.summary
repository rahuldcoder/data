-- on february 26 , 2012 , @entity1 , a @entity1 volunteer at the retreat at @entity4 housing complex in @entity5 , @entity6 , shot and killed @entity7 , an unarmed @entity8 17 - year - old			1
initially , @entity1 was not arrested , and no charges were brought against him			1
rallies , protests and a media firestorm followed , even eliciting a comment from president @entity14 that " if i had a son , he 'd look like @entity7			1
" the rev. @entity16 came to @entity5 and admonished residents that they were " risking going down as the @entity18 and @entity19 of the 21st century " if nothing was done			1
@entity21 , one of the attorneys representing @entity7 's parents and an instrumental advocate for bringing charges against @entity1 after they were initially declined , maintains that the case is about civil rights			1
whether the killing turns out to have been racially motivated , responded to in self - defense , the act of a resident concerned about the safety of his neighborhood or the act of a trigger - happy cop wannabe , race is an inescapable issue			1
in 2012 : did politics drive prosecution in @entity7 case ? @entity5 is the county seat of @entity43 , @entity6			1
although it experienced explosive growth during the economic boom and has several large , modern upscale subdivisions , it remains relatively poor			0
with approximately 54,000 residents , it has a per capita income of only about $ 21,000 , with about 18.5 % of the city below the poverty line , according to the 2010 census			0
it is approximately 30 % @entity8 and 20 % @entity1			2
it has a documented history of racial tensions between its police and its black residents			2
@entity43 is more than 80 % white ( including white @entity63 ) and only about 11 % black			0
overall , only 10 % of the population is below the poverty line , and that factors in @entity5			2
if @entity5 is removed from the equation , @entity43 is overall a very affluent county , predominantly white and @entity69 and filled with pockets of substantial wealth and gated subdivisions			2
@entity43 has become more suburban , and as growth has skyrocketed , the white population has diluted the strength of @entity5 's @entity8 vote and diminished its influence in elections			2
the prosecution of @entity1 in the @entity7 killing has become a lightning rod for the racial discontent that has long been brewing in @entity5			1
many are invested in believing this case to be representative of the bigotry that sadly still exists in certain quarters of the town			0
in 2012 : @entity7 shooting was n't a case of racial profiling a history of police indifference and societal prejudice has allowed this case , rightly or wrongly , to become the symbol for many of all things wrong with the criminal justice system and its treatment of blacks over the years , not only in @entity5 but in many places throughout the country			1
it 's a large part of the reason that there has been so much inflammatory rhetoric and passion attached to this case			0
as you see the lawyers from each side pick a jury over the next week or two , do n't believe for a second that they are unaware of the strong racial issues that divide opinions			1
a deadly combination - guns and ' stand your ground ' the chances of the defense seeking a black juror , especially one from @entity5 , are slim			0
conversely , the prosecution will do all it can to select such a juror			0
neither will acknowledge that race is a factor in their selection , but they know the history , the passions and the statistics			0
do n't kid yourself for a minute that they do n't			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			0

race has been an issue in the @entity7 killing since the *incident*
@entity135 says lawyers may deny it , but they will focus on race in picking a jury
@entity5 , @entity6 , has a history of racial tension , he says
@entity150 : the prosecution of @entity1 has become a lightning rod for that tension
