@entity0 -- @entity3 's recent economic downturn is spurring a new wave of worker strikes , which experts say are the only effective channel for them to air their grievances			1
thousands of workers at the @entity10 in @entity11 , a manufacturing hub in southern @entity14 province , clashed with police last week to demand better pay			1
factory managers laid off 18 employees and cut overtime after a drop in overseas orders -- prompting employees to demonstrate at the local government building			0
" the slow - down strike is still on but there 's no street protest because the police have been mobilized , " said one worker , who asked to remain anonymous when interviewed by phone five days after the labor action			1
" a dozen workers got injured during the clash and were sent to hospital			2
" @entity3 labor unrest flares as orders fall the protest is one of many to hit manufacturers operating in southern @entity14 province -- the " workshop of the world " -- as increasingly frustrated workers vent their discontent at low pay and poor working conditions			1
" this is probably the most intense spike in worker activism since the wave of strikes that hit @entity3 manufacturers in summer 2010 , " said @entity45 of @entity46 , a @entity47 - based group that monitors labor issues in @entity3			1
in june , workers at the @entity56 and @entity57 plants in southern @entity3 went on strike , halting production and forcing pay hikes			1
experts attribute the spike in protests to employers maximizing their shrinking profits at the expense of workers			1
" there are a broad range of complaints but they are basically related to being squeezed by their employers who are themselves making less profit , " said @entity45			2
" also many businesses in the @entity76 are planning to relocate inland and this is creating uncertainty and anxiety among the workforce			0
" @entity3 's economy has become the world 's second largest after three decades of rapid growth , and much of that growth has been driven by exports and large infrastructure projects			1
but lately , the economic engine has been running out of gas			1
@entity3 's mighty industrial engine is stalling home sales fell 25 % last month and a report this week said manufacturing may be at a three - year low			1
the economy grew 9.1 % last quarter from a year ago , the lowest since 2009 , but inflation still hovered at 5.5 % in october			0
@entity3 officials have tried to boost the economy with wage increases			1
several provinces and cities have increased wages this year			0
@entity101 raised its minimum wage by 17 % , while @entity14 , @entity3 's export base , boosted theirs by an average of 21 %			1
some experts say the salary hikes will accelerate the country 's industrial restructuring , saying higher labor costs will force enterprises to be more technologically advanced and transform @entity3 's export - oriented economic growth model to one that is boosted by domestic demand			1
but others worry the wage hikes may lead to massive layoffs in companies already facing increased factory payrolls and production costs , leading to labor unrest			0
the specter of large - scale labor unrest worries @entity3 officials whose fear of " luan " ( chaos ) is close to visceral			2
" @entity128 unrest is a glaring reminder to them that their attempts to reduce social injustice and income disparity are not working , " opined @entity45			0
" they are trying manage social and economic disputes in the usual administrative top - down manner without giving workers a voice in resolving their own grievances			2
that is why workers have no choice but to take to streets to make their voices heard			2
" @entity3 strictly bans independent unions			2
it worries that independent union members might challenge the government as the solidarity movement did in @entity150			0
the authorities are quick to suppress any labor group not under their direct control			0
workers can only turn to the @entity155 , a government - sanctioned organization whose primary mission is to support @entity160 policies and seek basic compensation for workers			0
with no means of collective bargaining , workers resort to petitioning the government -- or illegal protests			2
@entity168 , who works at the @entity169 , said workers typically go on strike due to lack of labor union or organizations that can genuinely represent their interests			0
" the workers ' main complaint is the lack of channel , a system , that can allow them to fight for their interests , " he said			0
" they can only resort to strikes to assert their rights and to counterbalance the power of the employer			0
" he , whose @entity14 - based law firm mainly handles labor rights cases , said the @entity3 authorities would be better off allowing trade unions if they wish to avert luan and maintain social stability			1
" to protect worker 's rights is to protect stability , " he added			0
" only when rights are protected can stability be realized			0
