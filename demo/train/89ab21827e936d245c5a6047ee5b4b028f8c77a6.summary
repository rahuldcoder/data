-- @entity1 has sprung and as far as golf fans are concerned , that means only one thing -- it 's time for the masters			1
@entity8 's first major of 2014 begins at the famed @entity9 on thursday , this year marking the 78th installment of one of sport 's most enduring contests			1
they are four captivating days in @entity15 that never fail to throw up a myriad of storylines , sub plots and sensations			2
with the field as wide open as ever , @entity22 looks at six @entity24 headlines waiting to be written			1
@entity25 assumes @entity27 's mantle the buildup to any major championship is always dominated by @entity27 -- whether he is playing or not			1
even @entity25 has said it will be " weird " not to have @entity31 prowling @entity9 's fairways			1
with the world no. 1 missing his first masters due to a back injury , most homegrown fervor will focus on " @entity25 , " the man who already has three green jackets in his wardrobe			2
the 43 - year - old has had his own fitness worries , withdrawing from two tournaments this season , but returned his best finish of the year at the @entity45 just a few days ago			2
the only current player who can hold a candle to @entity25 in terms of @entity24 success is @entity27 , whose four @entity9 titles match the feats of @entity52 -- two behind the record haul of another legend of the game , @entity54			1
@entity25 's most recent triumph came in 2010 and featured a shot that has gone down as one of the finest in the tournament 's illustrious history			2
it also showcased @entity25 's game perfectly , as he launched a six - iron from pine needles behind a tree onto the 13th green , over the stream that protects the front of the green			2
should @entity25 find his very best this week , a fourth @entity24 crown is a distinct possibility			2
a wide open field trying to predict the next major champion is a futile exercise			0
since the start of the 2009 season , there have been 18 different winners of the 20 major titles on offer -- and 15 of those were first - time victors			1
such is the talent being stockpiled at the top of the game , the winner could come from pretty much any continent and be stationed at either end of the age spectrum			0
@entity89 's @entity88 was 22 when he won the @entity90 at @entity91 -- the youngest winner since 1923 , when the legendary @entity94 @entity93 triumphed			1
and @entity25 clocked in at 43 years young when he secured the fifth major of his career at the 2013 @entity97 at @entity98 in @entity99			0
talented teenagers and voracious veterans lurk at every corner of a major championship field , and of the 97 players competing , around 70 will think they have a realistic chance of winning			0
@entity88 's redemption ? until @entity88 is cloaked in a green jacket , the abiding memory of his @entity24 experience will be of a red - faced youngster slumped over his club as one of golf 's greatest chokes took hold			1
at the tender age of 21 , he went into the final round at @entity9 in 2011 with a four - shot lead , and blew it in epic style			1
the sight of @entity88 wandering around the @entity122 cabins 50 yards to the left of the 10th fairway looking for his errant tee shot are now the stuff of legend			2
by the time he signed for an eight - over final round of 80 , to sink from first place to a tie for 15th , there was n't a right - minded spectator who did n't feel the urge to give him a consoling hug			0
a typically stoic interview on the 18th further endeared the youngster to viewers the world over , as he admitted he could n't put his finger on why he had " unraveled " in such a fashion			0
he later said he " was n't ready to win a major " but just a few months later , he was			0
at the very next major , he shot a record low @entity144 score to win at @entity91 in @entity145 by an emphatic eight shots			0
the next year he doubled his major tally , adding the @entity148 to his trophy cabinet , but you get the feeling he wo n't be content until his redemption at @entity9 is complete			2
the @entity154 invasion @entity155 became the first @entity156 to win the @entity24 last year but how long will it be before the first @entity154 winner of golf 's most prestigious prize ? last year 's tournament was abuzz with the sight of @entity164 's @entity163 striding the famous fairways at the tender age of 14 , and winning the low amateur medal			1
the child prodigy represents a burgeoning talent pool in @entity154 , seeking to build on the breakthrough success made by @entity171 at the 2009 @entity148			2
not only did the @entity172 serve notice of @entity154 's arrival at the top table of golf , he did it by beating the greatest golfer of a generation -- @entity27			1
the highest - ranked @entity154 player is @entity181 's @entity180 , who sits 26th in the world list on only his second year on the @entity183			1
@entity180 won the leading amateur prize on his @entity9 debut as a 19 - year - old in 2011 and already has a top - five finish on this season 's @entity183			1
his compatriot @entity189 has a top - 10 place to his name this season despite languishing in the lower reaches of the top 100 , while @entity172 veteran @entity195 has been a longstanding representative of @entity154 at the top level			1
another one to watch is @entity199 's 51st - ranked @entity198 , who has five @entity201 titles to his name			2
the @entity203 sequel ? the last person to retain the @entity24 crown was -- yep , you guessed it -- woods back in 2002 but could @entity155 be about to double @entity156 's tally of wins at @entity9 ? no - one is ranked higher than the 33 - year - old going into the tournament			1
in fact , only a poor final round at the @entity214 in march prevented him from returning to @entity15 as world no. 1			0
he spoke on tuesday of the privileges afforded to a @entity24 champion -- playing the course with his father @entity220 and hanging out in the champions ' locker room			0
and after an arduous few years trying to land his maiden major , with his slump a the @entity97 in 2012 a particularly bitter pill to swallow , @entity155 's game has been freed up after last year 's win			1
" it has been incredible to see the reception i get every week i play since being a @entity24 champion , " he said in his press conference			0
" it has been a real buzz for me to be welcomed at all the golf courses i 'm at			0
" this week has been something i have been really looking forward to			0
but as the last week came around , i also realized it would be time for me to bring the green jacket back and leave it here maybe			0
" so that motivated me to work harder that last week at home and try and get myself into some kind of form that can maybe go back - to - back and keep the jacket for another year			0
" a @entity241 2014 ? the last @entity241 to don the famous green jacket was @entity243 in 1999			0
it was the second time the @entity245 had triumphed at @entity9 , having won the masters in 1994			2
arguably the third leg of a hat - trick of @entity243 's career highlights also came on @entity94 soil , when he masterminded what will forever be known as the " @entity253 " when serving as @entity241 's @entity255 captain			0
trailing 10 - 6 going into the final day of singles matches in the @entity255 clash between @entity241 and the @entity94 , @entity243 's men pulled off one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time to eventually triumph 14Â½ points to @entity262			1
the @entity94 team , led this time by veteran @entity265 , are plotting their revenge ahead of the next clash in @entity99 in october , but what better way to lay down a marker than for a @entity241 to end the continent 's 14 - year drought at @entity9 ? there are four @entity241 players in the world 's top 10 and two of them -- @entity279 's @entity278 and @entity88 -- are already major champions			1
@entity282 's @entity281 won both the @entity183 's @entity283 and the @entity284 to @entity285 last year , while @entity286 has finished in the top five in all four major championships during his career			0
do n't be surprised if @entity241 marches off with another major honor come sunday			0
the @entity27 factor he might not be playing but that does n't mean @entity27 wo n't still be a talking point in masters week			0
whether it is clips of his famous chip - in back in 2005 , or reams of column inches detailing his four masters wins , @entity27 's absence certainly does n't mean he 'll be absent from the debate			1
and of course , once the green jacket has been placed on the shoulders of the winner , a popular refrain might be " what if @entity27 had been playing ? "			0

@entity22 takes a look at six *potential* storylines ahead of the 2014 masters
@entity88 and @entity155 dominate most of the buildup to @entity9 tournament
could the season 's first golf major throw up the @entity24 ' first @entity154 winner ?
masters runs from april 10 - 14 at world famous @entity9
