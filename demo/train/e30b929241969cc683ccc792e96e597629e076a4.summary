-- former @entity2 champion @entity1 was back on the football field wearing his no. 4 jersey and throwing touchdowns in front of a cheering crowd			1
but while his fans from @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will be able to see him in action at 8 p.m. et august 26 on @entity13 , he 's not making yet another comeback to the @entity15			1
@entity1 was on the field in @entity17 in downtown @entity18 recently with other @entity15 greats such as @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , playing in the annual @entity26 flag football game			1
@entity1 said he was happy to be back on the gridiron in organized play			1
" it 's kind of exciting , " @entity1 said			2
" obviously , it 's different			0
some of these guys i 've played against and had some battles ( with ) over the years , but it 's always nice to regroup and swap some old stories			0
it 's always fun to play football			2
" before the high - scoring affair , which included video game - style gold balls for 12 - point scores and special bonuses for touchdowns thrown in certain spots in the end zone , the 11 - time pro bowler was n't promising a return to his glory days			2
" i would n't expect too much , but we 've got a lot of pride			0
no one 's an athlete like @entity22 ( @entity22 ) ; he 's in a class by himself			0
the rest of us are just trying to show we still have a little bit of skills , " he said			0
@entity1 was gunslinging against veteran quarterback @entity57 , who 's not ready for retirement yet			2
the annual event , which also featured celebrities such as @entity61 ( " @entity65 " ) , @entity62 ( " @entity66 " ) , @entity63 ( " @entity67 " ) and singer @entity64 , helps drum up awareness for what gamers believe is the true start of the new @entity15 season -- the launch of @entity26 " @entity74 " on august 28			1
" i hope @entity26 does n't judge us off of today , " @entity1 said jokingly			1
" the kids i work with back at the high school back home , they were giving me a hard time			0
they said i 'm real slow on @entity81			1
i 'm hoping to change that today			0
" @entity1 played video games back in the day such as @entity84 and @entity85 , but he says he 's seen gaming come a long way since then			1
and he believes video games such as " @entity81 " can help aspiring quarterbacks			1
" i think it 's beneficial , " @entity1 said			2
" i also think that kids should get out and play , actually get out and do some physical stuff			2
i think @entity81 does teach them a lot about the sport			1
the fan base that video games have reached is amazing			0
the advancements that they 've made are just unbelievable			0
i think in a lot of ways it 's good , as long as the kids will get out and participate in some of the things that they 're playing ( onscreen )			1
" @entity1 was on the cover of " @entity107 " back in 2008 , which marked the 20th anniversary of the bestselling game franchise			1
@entity1 was originally seen in his @entity9 uniform , but @entity111 changed subsequent cover art to reflect his @entity114 uniform after he came out of retirement to play again			1
" i was n't jinxed ( being on the cover ) ; i would n't say that , " said @entity1 , referring to the " @entity117 " that has seen more than its fair share of cover athletes suffer injuries or other mishaps the season after they appear			2
" i consider it a huge honor			0
" @entity127 wide receiver @entity126 graces the cover of the new " @entity74			2
" @entity111 says it has completely overhauled the game , making the most changes to the franchise in its history			0
one of the additions is a new online mode that allows players to take former greats all the way to the @entity138			1
when asked what it 's like to remain in the @entity81 franchise after retirement , @entity1 replied , " it 's nice to know i 'm alive and kicking , let 's just put it that way			1
" another new feature that armchair quarterbacks will be happy with is that the new @entity81 game allows players to lead the receivers -- just like @entity1 did during his career			1
when it comes to technology and video games , @entity1 has no idea what 's next for " @entity157 " or beyond , he said			1
" i do n't even want to guess , " @entity1 said			2
" just when you think you 've seen it all , something else comes out			0
i think that as great as it is now , the advancements that have been made ; i just think it 's going to grow tremendously			0
" while @entity1 is from the original generation of arcade gamers , today 's @entity15 players have grown up with controllers in their hands			2
" they play video games all the time , " said @entity169 @entity20 , who was also on the field with @entity1			1
" they play @entity81 more than they want to practice for the real football game			1
it just shows that it 's a great game and that you can get consumed by it			0
you 've got to be smart , make decisions , and do all of that stuff , but it 's an unbelievable game			0
" one current player , and the coach of one of the two @entity26 teams , said that he does n't play as much any more			1
" i used to be really big into @entity81 , but it 's gotten kind of complicated now , " the @entity189 ' @entity188 said			2
" when you 're getting skunked by some of your friends , teammates and peers , it 's not as fun as it used to be			0
so i watch and buy the game so that i can find out what my rating is			0
i 'm either cursing out @entity81 for my rating being too low , or i 'm semi-happy because they raised it up a little bit			2
" with real playbooks featured in @entity81 and constant input by @entity81 himself , the ' x 's and o 's ' of football are being taught to the next generation of gridiron greats			1
" what i love about @entity81 is that it teaches kids like my sons @entity21 and @entity216 how to read man in zone defenses at an early age , " @entity211 said			1
" i 'm taking them on the field now and explaining things , and they 're like , ' yeah , i understand , @entity224			0
' i say , ' that 's right , from the video game			0
' it really is amazing how much the game teaches			0
" technology is advancing to the point where the new @entity81 game on @entity232 will allow players to design custom calls on their tablet and import them into the game			1
kinect owners will also be able to call audibles using their voice			0
" in a few years , if the players in the video game are n't speaking and disagreeing with their coaches ' calls and things like that , i would be really surprised , " @entity2 champion @entity23 said			0
" it has advanced that far			0
you can be a general manager , a coach or a player			0
you can do just about anything in the game			0
" and the @entity81 game still has enough pull to bring former @entity15 greats back to the field to play the sport they continue to love , even if these days they 're only making those amazing highlight reel plays virtually .			1

@entity1 will play in a " @entity263 flag football game august 26
@entity1 says as long as kids are athletic in real life , @entity81 games can teach them a lot
