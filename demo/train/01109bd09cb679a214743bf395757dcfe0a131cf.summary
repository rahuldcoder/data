-- as @entity2 begins her legal career , she has not only her own expectations to live up to , but those of a generation : she has just become @entity8 's first female lawyer			1
after three years of petitioning the @entity9 , @entity10 , 25 , has finally received her registration to practice as a trainee lawyer , the first woman to do so			1
" people tell me i 'm a pioneer and i feel i need to live up to what they expect of me , " says @entity10			0
" there 's a great sense of responsibility			2
from now on , people will look at everything i do			0
" @entity10 , who decided on a legal career while preparing for university , graduated from @entity24 in @entity25 in 2010 and expected to be able to practice as a lawyer immediately			1
but much to her frustration , she has spent three years in a professional no - man 's land , able to work as " legal consultant " but not officially recognized as a lawyer			1
universities in @entity8 began taking female law students in 2005 and the first graduates completed their studies in 2008			1
but the optimism soon wore off when female graduates found themselves unable to gain registration to practice			1
many of @entity10 's classmates , frustrated by the lack of progress in @entity8 , left the country to work abroad			1
but @entity10 stayed in her hometown of @entity25 and continued to apply for registration			0
in the meantime , some of her contemporaries began an online campaign to push for change , including a @entity58 group called " i am a lawyer , " a @entity47 campaign and @entity49 videos from women arguing their right to practice			1
in october last year , after accepting a petition with 3,000 signatures submitted by a group of female law graduates , @entity60 announced that women would be allowed to register as lawyers			1
however , the @entity9 still was n't processing applications from women			2
" i kept on following up , but they would n't give me an answer either way , " says @entity10			0
a friend and vocal campaigner , @entity74 , then wrote a newspaper article in which she pleaded with @entity60 to intervene			0
@entity74 had been one of @entity8 's first batch of female law graduates in 2008 , but had gone to the @entity78 to practice after becoming disillusioned with the situation at home			1
" i wrote about how depressing the situation was , saying here we were , many of us working for federal courts outside the @entity84 , because we had no future inside it , " says @entity10 - @entity74 two days later , the @entity9 announced they would start accepting applications and soon afterwards @entity10 's application was granted			0
now working as a trainee lawyer and due to qualify fully in two years , @entity10 hopes to pursue a career in family law to help other @entity8 women			1
" many women really need to talk to female lawyers , and i want to help those women to get their rights , " she says			2
@entity10 knows the path ahead wo n't always be smooth			0
" the social aspect is a very considerable one , for society to accept women lawyers , it 's something new , " she says			2
" it will be also challenging for the judiciary system to deal with female lawyers , but i think we can overcome these hardships if we prove ourselves as competent lawyers			0
" @entity109 , a @entity110 researcher for @entity111 , agrees that challenges remain for female lawyers			0
" @entity8 judges have a lot of leeway , and can remove a lawyer from a case , " says @entity109			2
" she might face judges rejecting her counsel or not allowing her to speak , particularly if that judge is conservative and does n't want women to speak in court			0
" other female lawyers are now following in @entity10 's footsteps and gaining registration , although exact numbers are unclear			2
for @entity10 , being able to pursue a legal career at home was well worth the wait			0
" success is a nice feeling , especially when it comes after tribulation , " she says .			0

@entity2 has become @entity8 's first female lawyer
women were able to study law , but could only practice as " legal consultants "
the move came after years of online *protests* from female law graduates
