and there might be more of them than you think			0
fifteen percent of adults in the @entity6 are not online , for reasons that range from lack of interest to fear of the unknown to not being able to afford a computer , says a new survey			1
and guess what ? almost all of them are ok with it			0
according to the report from the @entity18 , 92 % of respondents who said they are n't on the @entity20 also said they have no desire to be			1
the survey this spring used phone interviews with 2,252 adults who were 18 years old or older			1
it has a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points			0
as in earlier @entity18 studies , it appears that older @entity6 and those with less education are the least likely to be online			1
web usage was also slightly lower among rural @entity6 and @entity34			1
forty - four percent of adults 65 or older said they do n't use the @entity20			2
by comparison , only 2 % of those between 18 - 29 said the same			0
but education was almost as strong a factor as age in the results			2
a full 41 % of @entity6 who did n't get a high school diploma said they are n't on the @entity44 , compared to just 4 % who said they have a college degree			1
by far , the most popular reason given was some version of " i just do n't care about it			0
" more than one - third said they are " just not interested , " " do n't need it / do n't want it , " or " think it 's a waste of time			2
" less popular , but interesting , reasons included not having a computer ( 13 % ) , saying web access is too expensive ( 6 % ) and being limited by poor eyesight or another physical disability ( 4 % )			2
for all the talk recently about web security , government snooping and the like , only 3 % of respondents said they do n't go online because of worries about things like privacy , viruses , spam and hackers			1
even among the offline contingent , the @entity44 's broad reach was apparent			0
more than 4 out of 10 of nonconnected people said they 'd asked a friend or family member to look something up or complete a task online for them , and nearly a quarter say they live in a household where someone else uses the @entity44 .			0
