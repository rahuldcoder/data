-- i can vividly recall watching my first @entity2			1
lying on the floor of the @entity4 , @entity5 , home i grew up in , i tuned in each evening to the 1992 @entity6			0
i remember the moment when the athletes entered the stadium during the @entity10			0
as i saw @entity11 walk in , everyone dressed in stunning outfits , proudly waving our flag , i felt a sense of national pride that i had never known before			0
i was 9 at the time and completely enchanted by the magic of the @entity2			1
in a world full of politics and war , here was a moment where everyone could set aside their differences and instead battle on the playing field for the love of competition and national pride			2
in an ideal world this is what the @entity2 should always be about			1
however , we do not live in an ideal world			0
rather , we live in an imperfect one where something as simple and beautiful as loving someone can get you thrown to the streets or put in jail or even murdered			0
for this reason , as much as i am excited to see the incredible athletic contests at the @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , i am also paying close attention to the political theater that will play out there			1
people from around the world will be watching			0
we should use this opportunity to insist that @entity46 change its discriminatory laws against gay people			1
in the summer of 2013 , i had the distinct pleasure of representing the @entity57 at the @entity58 for @entity59 in @entity60			0
while there , i finished second in the 800 meters , and subsequently dedicated my medal to the gay community			0
this received much international media attention due to the fact that i was one of the first athletes to openly criticize @entity46 's anti-gay propaganda laws on @entity46 soil			1
though i was one of the first , i will certainly not be the last			0
as the @entity70 unfold , i am confident that we will see many olympians from around the world protest these antiquated and discriminatory laws			1
the @entity46 government will be faced with two choices : ignore those that break the law and face ridicule from its own people , or enforce its laws by punishing the lawbreakers and challenge the @entity84 to enforce its own charter			1
principle 6 of the @entity84 charter states that any form of discrimination , including sexual orientation , is incompatible with the @entity70			1
when the @entity84 awarded @entity46 the @entity44 , @entity46 had not yet passed their discriminatory laws			1
with the laws now firmly in place , the @entity84 has a responsibility to the international community to make sure that its charter is upheld or risk putting the @entity2 movement 's credibility at stake			1
as an athlete , i understand how hard the @entity2 athletes have trained for the last four years			1
they deserve the chance to compete against the world 's best at the highest level			0
however , their right to compete must not come at the expense of basic human rights			0
i encourage the athletes to remember why they are in @entity45 and what their primary job is			0
but i am confident that many of these olympians and their fans will also bring up the issue			2
we will probably see different forms of protest throughout the @entity2			2
and should @entity46 decide to enforce its discriminatory laws , the @entity84 must ultimately be held responsible			1
i ask that you join me in keeping the @entity84 accountable and demanding that it upholds its own charter			2
recently , two nonprofits , @entity122 and all out , joined forces to create the principle 6 campaign , which includes a petition calling for @entity46 to put an end to its discriminatory laws			1
the website contains information that can be shared via social media to remind people that sport does not and should not discriminate on the ground of race , religion , gender , politics , or sexual orientation			0
as always , i am eagerly counting down the days to the beginning of the next @entity2			2
we are sure to witness some of the finest displays of athletic brilliance the world has ever seen			0
in both the triumphs and defeats , let us allow these @entity2 to bring us together as citizens of the world			2
let us show support and thanks to the host nation , while at the same time holding it to the standards and responsibility that comes with the honor of hosting such a world - class event			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			2

@entity158 : olympians could raise issue of @entity46 's anti-gay laws
@entity158 : @entity84 is against all discrimination
he says if @entity46 crack down on gays , the @entity84 must not turn a blind eye
@entity158 : @entity2 is about setting aside differences , not *persecution*
