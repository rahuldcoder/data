violence in @entity1 has spiked in the last year , according to the @entity2 , but as has become the case with @entity4 , it 's rarely news if the day 's deaths are " only " in the tens			1
the same @entity8 governments who led the invasion of @entity1 in 2003 are now looking away , seeing @entity1 as the problem of previous administrations , and being preoccupied with fresher crises in @entity4 and @entity14			2
the impression of constant bad news belies the reality that violence in @entity1 had for some time been reduced , but is rapidly becoming worse again			2
more than 1,000 civilians died in july , levels not seen since the dark days of 2006 - 07			0
such violence is not a permanent reality for @entity1 , but is symptomatic of political failures			2
some @entity8 commentators portray @entity1 as a basket case , condemned to perpetual violence , reflecting something fundamentally wrong with @entity1 culture and society			2
this conveniently absolves the rest of the world of their shared responsibility for building up a political system where violence has been the main political currency , not just since 2003 but for years under the previous regime			0
@entity39 's 1980s war with @entity40 was encouraged by the @entity41 and by @entity1 's @entity43 neighbors , who turned a blind eye to his domestic repression and ethnic cleansing			1
after the @entity48 , internationally - imposed sanctions hollowed out @entity1 's middle class and made many @entity1 turn to corruption and organized crime to survive			1
examining the political causes of @entity1 's violence -- going beyond the caricatured and historical view that it is inevitable or permanent -- matters for the whole @entity56			1
@entity1 is not only geographically central , with about 30 million people and the world 's fifth largest oil reserves ; it has historically been a center of ideas			0
given @entity1 's international influence , the 2003 invasion was overtly designed not just to remove an anti-western regime , but to reshape the @entity56			1
but rather than becoming a model for democracy and the free market , the example of @entity1 has been used by conservative forces in the region to bolster their traditional pretense that the only political choices for @entity73 are authoritarian government or chaos			0
the violence between @entity78 and @entity79 political factions has also generated fears of wider sectarian conflict across the region , although violence occurs within , as well as between , religious groups , and its causes are political more than religious			1
the first reason for the recent spike in violence has been the spillover of fighting and tensions from the civil war in neighboring @entity4			0
there are close links between @entity1 and @entity4 societies and families , and as the conflict in @entity4 has become increasingly sectarian and internationalized , fighters from @entity1 are now involved on both sides			0
the recent split between the @entity102 and jihadi groups such as the @entity104 might present an opportunity for @entity1 's government to reconceptualize its interests in @entity4			1
despite their shared alliance with @entity40 , just a few years ago the @entity1 and @entity4 governments were at loggerheads as @entity1 suspected @entity4 of facilitating the entry of @entity113 fighters into its own territory			0
@entity1 's second problem is that it remains an arena where regional powers vie for influence , with @entity40 supporting the @entity79 ruling coalition , @entity120 supporting @entity78 groups and the secular @entity79 leader @entity122 , and @entity123 becoming ever closer to the @entity124			1
personal animosity between the leaders of @entity1 and @entity120 contributes to their poor relations , with @entity120 still unwilling to open an embassy in @entity1 more than a decade after the invasion			1
but the situation is not as simple as an inevitable tension between @entity78 and @entity79			2
the @entity120 king is said to respect @entity1 's main @entity79 cleric , ayatollah @entity133			1
encouraging religious dialogue between @entity78 and @entity79 clerics could be a useful aspect of conflict resolution			1
and the recent talks between the @entity139 and @entity40 is also an opportunity for @entity1 to act as a bridge , as one of the few countries to have strong relations with both			0
the third main driver of the current violence is the threat @entity1 faces from @entity113 -- and the political failure of the @entity1 government 's approach to fighting it			2
back in 2007 , thousands of @entity1 @entity78 fought with the @entity139 against @entity113			2
but rather than working with mainstream @entity78 political groups to build a united front against violent jihadis , the @entity153 government has treated the former as a political threat			0
this was epitomized by a death sentence passed against a @entity78 former vice-president , @entity161 , in 2012 for allegedly organizing death squads , when @entity79 politicians who have headed militias have been accommodated politically ( notably , the @entity165 , with a long record of sectarian violence , were absorbed into the national police )			1
protesters in sunni - majority provinces have called for changes to terrorism and @entity174 laws that they say treat all @entity78 as potential suspects			0
both @entity4 and @entity1 are rife with case studies of the ways in which human beings can be radicalized and brutalized			0
perhaps @entity8 find it easier to blame nebulous " cultural " factors than to imagine that we , too , could turn to violence and extremes if the states around us collapsed , and if we found ourselves in constant insecurity , with only sectarian or ethnic groups , and their militias , prepared to provide us with protection and services			0
but there is a need to refocus on @entity1 , as part of a broader strategy towards addressing the complex and interconnected problems across the @entity56 , though that will take more time and resources than continuing to lurch from crisis to crisis .			0

@entity1 violence is news if the day 's deaths are " only " in the tens , says @entity206
violence between @entity78 and @entity79 factions has stoked fears of regional conflict , she adds
personal animosity between @entity1 and @entity120 does *n't* help resolution - @entity206
@entity1 's second problem is that regional powers vie for influence , she argues
