@entity1 , @entity0 -- the creators are billing it as one of the coolest hostels in the world and it 's undoubtedly one of the most novel overnight stays you are ever likely to experience			2
welcome to the @entity11 -- an old @entity12 which is being converted into a 25 - room hostel at the @entity14			1
the @entity11 is currently being refurbished and will open for business in december 2008			1
the idea is the brainchild of @entity19 businessman and entrepreneur @entity18 , who has been running hostels in @entity22 , @entity19 for the past five years			1
renovation work is underway on a plane which used to carry in excess of 350 passengers			0
@entity11 is scheduled to open for business in december 2008 and will provide accommodation for up to 85 guests			1
@entity2 spoke to @entity18 about how he got the project off the ground			0
" we were looking to expand the business but it was more or less impossible to find reasonably priced housing at the airport			0
and you can not build a new house and run a hostel because it is too expensive , " he said			2
it was in 2006 that @entity18 first heard about the @entity12 , which was for sale			1
formerly flown by the now defunct @entity42 , the plane was wasting away in a hangar at @entity14 and had n't flown since 2002			1
" the plane was in a terrible state when we first saw it , " he said			0
" but we contacted the owners and gave them a fairly good offer , i think			0
" although he was n't prepared to let on exactly how much he paid for the old @entity12 , @entity18 confirmed that the price tag was a six - figure sum ( in euros )			1
@entity18 took possession of the 1976 @entity57 -- one of 393 built by the company until 1991 -- in june 2007 and by december he had reached agreement with the airport authorities about his unique proposal			0
in august 2008 the plane was finally moved to its permanent home at @entity14 's main entrance , where it will now stay			1
apart from the engines being removed from the wings before purchase , the plane , from the outside , looks almost exactly as it did when it was grounded			0
the interior , for obvious reasons , is a different matter			0
dismantling and stripping out all the old equipment and instruments started earlier this year			0
the final phase of refurbishment is nearing completion and @entity18 says it complies with the same building regulations required for a house			0
there will be two types of accommodation			0
a basic room will be roughly six square meters in size with sleeping space for three adults			2
it will cost € 110 ( $ 150 ) per night			1
but if you fancy splashing out , you can book the top deck , complete with the cockpit suite , which comes with a private bathroom and panoramic views of takeoffs and landings			1
@entity18 envisages newlyweds taking advantage of this more expensive option , which costs € 500 ( $ 700 )			1
if you do n't want to spend a whole night on board you can hop on and relax in the cafe suite for a couple of hours at a cost of € 25 ( $ 35 )			1
this will also afford you the opportunity of striding out onto the wing and taking in the views of the bustling airport			0
while most large commercial planes end up in vast aircraft boneyards , some , like the @entity11 , find new lives			2
@entity115 based urban architects lot - ek plan to create a library in @entity117 , @entity118 , made by recycling 200 @entity120 and 737 fuselages			2
and @entity122 millionaire @entity121 has started building a house from the parts of another scrapped 747 .			2
