-- " our inventions are wont to be pretty toys , which distract our attention from serious things			2
they are but improved means to an unimproved end			2
" - @entity8 the march on @entity9 in 1963 was a day for great speeches			1
of course , no one knew that the day would also include one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century , @entity15 " oration ( actually titled , " normalcy no more " )			1
in fact , @entity17 's adviser and draft speechwriter , @entity19 , says that with everyone consumed by march logistics , the speech was not their highest priority , and hours before the event while @entity17 was considering a theme for his speech he did n't know exactly what he would say			1
@entity30 , the triumph of procrastination			2
it was a different time , a time when politicians like @entity35 and preachers like @entity17 made efforts to craft big ideas in beautiful language			1
it was the age of thriving newspapers and bookstores			2
back then , audiences listened expectantly for the art of rhetoric			2
they demanded that speakers respect them enough to put real effort and poetry into their publicly spoken words			2
and , they listened without the pressure and distraction of multitasking on mobile devices			2
they listened patiently , even while sweating profusely in the august heat			0
what about today , in the age of social media ? would @entity17 be an active social media communicator ? and , a more important question : how well would @entity17 's gift for rhetoric translate over social networks ? opinion : 50 years later , civil rights struggle is far from over the answer to both questions is positive			1
as a public theologian he had an encyclopedic knowledge of political writings and literature			0
he had an amazing ability to educate , inspire and mobilize people through language and speech			0
he would have recognized that social media is the public square of the 21st century			1
a keen communicator could not afford to be silent in this space			1
according to @entity17 's advisers , @entity19 and @entity81 , @entity15 would have utilized @entity82 and other social media			1
@entity19 says , " he would be up all hours of the night telling me and @entity84 his thoughts and we would have learned to send tweets			0
" it 's worth noting that during the mid- 1950s , @entity17 ( most likely assisted by a staff member ) responded to readers ' letters in his " @entity92 " column in @entity94			1
he did this in order to communicate with a more diverse audience through popular media			1
he discontinued the responses after his life became too busy and his doctor recommended a slower pace following his 1958 stabbing			0
as a man who both loved people and loved to talk , he would have a large social media footprint			1
as for the second question , could @entity17 be @entity17 via @entity82 ? the real taste test is found in the actual language he used to educate and inspire			1
and , surprisingly , much of it fits within the most constraining of social media platforms , the 140 character limit of @entity82			1
here 's a sample : " injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere			1
we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality			0
" truth , crushed to earth , shall rise again			0
" ( quoting the poet @entity125 ) 42 characters			0
" we shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice			0
" ( paraphrasing abolitionist unitarian minister @entity130 ) 93 characters			0
" let justice roll down like waters and righteousness as a mighty stream			0
" ( from the biblical prophet @entity136 )			0
" i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality			0
" this is why right , temporarily defeated , is stronger than evil triumphant			0
" our loyalties must transcend our race , our tribe , our class , and our nation ; and this means we must develop a world perspective			0
and , " from every mountainside , let freedom ring			0
and when this happens , when we allow freedom to ring , when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet , from every state and every city , we will be able to speed up that day when all of @entity167 's children , black men and white men , @entity170 and @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 , will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old @entity177 spiritual , ' free at last ! free at last ! thank @entity178 , we are free at last ! ' " oops , 470 characters			2
ok , he 'd have to split that one into a quartet of tweets			0
@entity17 's instincts for youth culture were strong and , if alive today , he would be a prominent commentator with a vast social network of followers and friends			1
this would be an easy way to engage in meaningful dialogue with millennials and @entity191 , particularly important since researchers report that younger people do not attend traditional houses of worship at near the rate of their parents			0
in fact , we now call them " nones " referring to the fastest growing response to the question of one 's religious preference			2
probably , they would never hear his sermons from the pulpit , but they would read his tweets and @entity211 posts and see his @entity213 pics			2
for dr. @entity17 , everybody in and nobody out seeking to engage youth , he taught a course at @entity217 to a small group of college students that included former @entity221 chairman @entity220 , he spoke to countless university audiences , and he was famously photographed playing pool on @entity225 's west side with " the boys in the hood " -- not to mention the touching photos of him with his own lovely children			1
@entity17 was determined to remain relevant to a dynamic freedom movement that rode on the backs of students despite the fact that , ultimately , he was bound by conscience to criticize the most militant expressions of that youth culture , largely dominated by @entity237 , @entity238 of " black power " fame , anti-war hippies , and @entity242 , co-founder and icon of the @entity244			1
his inner moral compass compelled him to criticize ideologies that encouraged further racial separatism and / or violence			0
@entity250 executive chairman @entity249 and @entity251 say in a new book , " @entity261 , " that the @entity253 is " the largest experiment involving anarchy in history " creating a brave new capacity for free expression and free movement of information			0
we have seen evidence most recently in @entity264 where the @entity265 was driven by social media but later also led to troubling disruptions to a young , fragile democracy			1
@entity17 was no fan of anarchy			1
he was irrevocably committed to nonviolent civil disobedience , and would have taken pains to influence the marketplace of ideas toward greater order , fairness , interdependence and civility			0
our new global connectivity requires an encompassing moral vision of how humans can and should live together			0
dr. @entity17 understood this and would be an active voice expressing the big ideas of freedom and justice for all , through mellifluous phrases and cadences that would appeal even to hip hop ears			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			1

@entity291 : @entity17 was an especially *skilled* communicator
@entity291 says @entity17 would have used social media tools to share his **message**
@entity17 reached out , not only through sermons and speeches , but also the media
@entity291 : @entity17 's **message** would still have broad appeal today
