@entity0 -- technological challenges would pose major obstacles to the installation of platform doors in @entity0 's subway system , transit officials said monday			1
during a transit and bus committee meeting at the @entity12 headquarters , board members discussed the possibility of installing such barriers to curb the number of subway train fatalities			1
the discussion came in the wake of two incidents last year in which people were pushed onto the tracks and fatally struck by trains			1
in december , @entity24 - @entity23 , 58 , was pushed onto the tracks in a subway station near @entity26 by a 30 - year - old homeless man			1
a few weeks later , a 31 - year - old woman was charged with second - degree murder as a hate crime for pushing 46 - year old @entity31 onto the tracks at a subway station in @entity33			2
in 2012 , there were 141 subway incidents in which a person came into contact with a train , 55 of which were fatal ; that 's slightly more than the average of 135 accidents per year , said @entity43 , vice president of system safety at the @entity12			1
thirty - three of the 141 were alleged or attempted suicides , 54 occurred while the victim was standing on the platform , and three occurred when riders fell between the cars , she said			0
the installation of platform doors in @entity0 's subways could potentially end incidents in which customers are pushed or accidentally fall or climb down intentionally to retrieve dropped items			1
it could also increase security by limiting unauthorized track access , resulting in less vandalism and litter , according to the @entity12			2
however , such an installation would prove costly and complicated			0
" when the system was designed over 110 years ago , it did n't plan for that , " said @entity62 , president of @entity12 @entity63			1
" it 's hard to incorporate into the system now			1
" investigations into the feasibility of installing subway platform doors included the examination of public transportation systems in @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and other international cities			0
the preliminary conclusion was that the age and diversity of @entity0 's 468 subway stations would require major changes to their structures and electrical systems			0
one problem is that stations have unique characteristics , some with curved tracks and column lines near the platform edge			0
" in stations where we have barely managed to create an accessible path for the disabled , construction may prove to be infeasible , " said @entity93 , chief of operations planning			0
" many stations are listed as landmark or historical , which will require external review and approval of all designs			0
" challenges would include the need for platform edge reinforcement to hold up new walls , electrical upgrades in tight spaces , train door and platform alignment and communication issues , and accommodation of train cars of different sizes and with doors in different places			0
the cost of installation and maintenance would also be a challenge in a system that operates around the clock , @entity93 said			0
" i do not want to give the impression that any death is acceptable , " said @entity62			2
however , " there are technological issues we need to overcome to come up with a solution			1
" @entity130 , a staff attorney for the @entity131 for the @entity132 , said he shared the concerns expressed by @entity12 representatives , but suggested exploring alternatives like intrusion - detection technology			2
such a system would alert train personnel when someone was on the track or too near the edge of the platform , he said			0
" it seems like it would be a lot cheaper , " he said			0
though people have been hit by trains for as long as trains have been around , he said , " that does n't mean you should just shrug and say it 's like the weather			2
" @entity154 president @entity153 called last week for the @entity12 's inspector general to carry out an investigation into subway fatalities and to consider new safety programs			1
" the @entity12 ca n't just revert to the easy fixes ; i am asking that the agency take a more comprehensive approach by keeping all options on the table that make sense for the safety of commuters and the @entity12 's bottom line			1
" @entity1 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			0

" it 's hard to incorporate into the system now , " says @entity12 's @entity172
" there are technological issues we need to overcome , " says @entity62
the discussion comes in the wake of two deaths where people were pushed onto the tracks
