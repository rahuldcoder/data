-- president @entity1 faces a terrible choice in the coming days			1
it is whether to kill a number of @entity5 who had nothing to do with a poison - gas massacre to show president @entity9 , who presumably did have something to do with it , that using chemicals weapons violates an international norm			1
few would doubt the importance of international agreements to regulate war , particularly those that safeguard the rights of citizens , such as bans on chemical weapons and torture			1
if @entity9 is responsible for the use of chemical weapons , he had full knowledge of the norms he was violating			1
by way of comparison , president @entity26 chose a policy that allowed torture in interrogations with full knowledge that it was outlawed by agreements to which the @entity33 was a signatory			0
he made a strategic choice in the face of a threat to national security			0
both are abhorrent actions on the part of national leaders , both taken for fundamentally the same reasons			0
an attack on the @entity5 military by the @entity33 would send a message to @entity9 , but it is not clear if @entity1 has any strategic objective beyond that			1
whether he has such a plan or not , any @entity33 attack will have implications for the civil war , no matter how much @entity1 says otherwise			1
if the @entity33 launches missiles into @entity5 , those cheering the loudest will be the @entity5 rebels			2
the @entity33 will be intervening in the @entity5 civil war on behalf of the rebels			1
a significant amount of research , including my own , demonstrates that military interventions from outside states lengthen and make bloodier civil wars			1
much of this evidence is the result of statistical modeling of all civil wars and any associated interventions			1
the data include roughly 1,000 interventions into 100 civil wars over the last 60 years , with research carried out by multiple research teams			1
the results point to patterns in what happens when states intervene to try to help their preferred actor , and the results are strong and consistent that interventions rarely work to promote peace or reduce violence			0
for example , my own research has shown that the likelihood of a civil war lasting for four years without an intervention is 37 % , but if there is an intervention the likelihood that it lasts for four years is 60 %			1
the intervention accounts for the 50 % increase in the length of the war			2
longer wars are generally bloodier			2
examples might include the @entity99 war in the 1980s , and the @entity5 war up to this point			1
the meager support for the rebels has allowed them to push harder against the government , and whether or not we support the government , the killing and the war 's duration has only increased			2
it 's hard to predict exactly what will happen , of course , but once the @entity33 bombs @entity5 forces , it is possible that the rebels will take that moment to launch their own offensive , forcing the @entity5 government to respond even more resolutely , greatly worsening the bloodshed			1
even if a @entity33 missile strike reflects inadvertent help for the rebels , history does not point to a good outcome for @entity33 policy			0
the only pathway by which external interventions consistently make for shorter or less bloody wars is through diplomatic efforts to broker a peace agreement			0
the same modeling evidence suggests that the war in @entity132 , 1975 - 1991 , could have been shortened by nearly 10 years with well - timed diplomatic interventions			1
from this perspective , a missile strike will only move the situation further from peace			0
sometimes the difficulty for warring parties to come to a negotiating table is tied up in information that is held private , the very thing that mediators can manage			0
so why not engage in serious diplomacy ? the @entity33 has two stated policies , at least beyond the immediate question of punitive bombing in response to the chemical attacks			0
the first is to aid the @entity5 opposition in its fight against the @entity9 regime ; the second is to help broker a negotiated settlement			2
the second goal makes sense ; the first is fraught with difficulties			0
two aspects of the negotiated route pose a problem for the @entity33			0
first , the official @entity33 policy is that @entity9 must go			0
both former secretary of state @entity162 and secretary of state @entity163 have made these claims			0
second , the rebels have steadfastly refused to negotiate			0
the only policy on the table is to kill more @entity5 to show the @entity5 leaders that killing @entity5 is wrong			2
in this regard , @entity33 policies are inconsistent with past behavior , empirical evidence and logic			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			2

@entity176 : @entity1 facing *decision* on striking @entity5 over use of chemical weapons
whatever strategic reasons , he says , @entity1 's act would have implications for @entity5 's civil war
he says much research shows outside intervention in civil wars makes them longer and worse
@entity176 : statistical evidence suggests well - timed negotiations can shorten war
