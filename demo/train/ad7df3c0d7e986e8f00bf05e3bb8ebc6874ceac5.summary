it is as simple as that			0

there is no problem , " he said , while confirming that @entity72 striker @entity101 would play despite sunday 's top - of - the - table derby clash with @entity103 looming			1
@entity101 started on the bench against @entity10 following the news that he will be banned for all three of @entity72 's @entity71 finals group matches after his red card against @entity108			1

he did n't expect that			0
