@entity0 had quite the play - date set for her daughter @entity3 -- a baby tiger , during their trip to @entity6			1
the @entity8 's glamorous visit to @entity6 during the holidays is well documented on @entity0 's @entity10 , but it 's a fan photo of the family posing with a baby tiger that 's not sitting well with an animal rights organization and critics			1
the photo shows @entity0 petting the baby tiger while it 's being bottle fed at the @entity19 theme park , with hubby @entity20 and @entity3 looking on			1
" tourists like @entity0 are often unaware of the cruelty tigers suffer for these tourist attractions , " said @entity21 in a statement , " the tigers used for these photos are often forcibly removed from their mothers to be fed artificially by tourists			0
they are also crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods			0
" @entity0 and @entity20 are n't the first to be blasted for posing with a tiger			1
a recent @entity36 bill bans people from posing for photos while hugging , patting or touching tigers			0

@entity0 's elephant ride during the trip also came under criticism , with the organization @entity53 reminding the singer of the " incredible amount of suffering involved in @entity6 elephant tourism			1
" the @entity57 would like to see all tourists avoid visiting parks where animals are held in captivity			2
" we 're sure that the @entity66 , like many unsuspecting tourists , would be horrified to learn that baby elephants and tigers propped up for photo ops are typically torn away from their mothers , violently beaten by trainers , and deprived of everything natural and important to them , " @entity57 deputy general counsel @entity62 said in a statement to @entity1			0
