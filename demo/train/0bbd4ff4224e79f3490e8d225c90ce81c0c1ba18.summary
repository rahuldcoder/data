" this was actually the last match of my career			2
sorry , " the 28 - year - old said during an emotional press conference in @entity29			2
" my body just ca n't do it anymore			1
i 've already been through a lot of injuries since the beginning of the year			2
" i 've been on the tour for so long , and i really pushed through and left it all during that @entity5			1
i really felt i gave all the energy i have left in my body			1
" i made my dream a reality and it will stay with me forever , but now my body just ca n't cope with everything			1
i have pain everywhere after 45 minutes or an hour of play			2
i 've been doing this for so long , and body-wise i just ca n't do it anymore			0
" @entity1 had not planned on calling time on her career prior to the match , but she knew once the contest had finished that it was time to hang up her racket			1
" you never know before the match that it 's going to be your last match , " she explained , " but i just felt that way after the match			1
" i felt i just could n't do this anymore			0
after one set , my whole body was just in pain			2
" it 's been a tough decision to make			2
i did n't make this decision easily			0
i 've been a tennis player for a long time , and i had the chance to make my biggest dream a reality			2
i felt i really , really pushed through the ultimate limits to make it happen			0
" but now i just ca n't do it anymore			0
" @entity1 turned pro in 2000 and , after battling for 13 years to win one of tennis ' four grand slams , she now feels the time has earned the right to focus on other areas of her life			1
" as a tennis player you had to be at 100 % , " she added			2
" i 'm the kind of person , when i 'm doing something , i 'm doing it 100 %			0
i have to be on the practice court preparing for the next tournament tomorrow			0
" there are so many things to do in life rather than playing tennis , so i 'm sure i 'll find something			2
i just need a bit of time to settle down			0
" there is a lot of excitement as a woman			0
there is a lot of excitement as a wife			0
there is a lot of excitement as a mother			0
there is a lot of excitement to come up			0
" @entity1 was taught tennis as a child by her father @entity106 , a doctor who coached her for most of her playing days until they split earlier this year and she began working with former world no. 1 @entity108			1
" i called him , yes			0
but my dad knows me enough to know it a bit when he saw me leaving home for the @entity113 , " @entity1 said			1
" he kind of felt i was tired and i was exhausted , and he was not surprised by the decision			0

an unorthodox player with a distinctive serving style , she earned more than $ 11 million on the court -- $ 2.87 million of that this year -- with eight @entity131 titles			0
" i congratulate @entity1 on her long , successful career , " said @entity131 chief @entity132			1
" she is an inspirational champion and a great ambassador for women 's tennis that has dedicated her life to the sport and given so much back to the game			1
" @entity141 , a tennis writer with @entity142 , said the timing of @entity1 's decision has stunned everyone			1
" it is quite shocking , even before this tournament she had been making plans to play in exhibitions in @entity150 in january , she had been talking about still being motivated and wanting to achieve more goals in tennis , " @entity141 told @entity0			2
" i think a lot of people are either second guessing her decision or just saying ' you know what , @entity1 played her tennis career on her own terms , in her own way , this is exactly the way @entity1 would go out			1
' " @entity163 , who was unable to defend his @entity5 title in 2002 due to injury , said @entity1 might regret her decision when next year 's tournament starts in late june			1

@entity174 , who was @entity1 's captain in @entity6 's @entity176 team , said she may have made a hasty decision			1

" i hope she is going to change her mind			0
you do n't want to have regrets looking back			0
being a professional player is such an exceptional job and you do n't want to look back in a few months or years later and think , ' why did i stop ? ' " go to the beach for a few days , go running in the park , just get your head together , spend some time with your friends			2
and , if you do n't want to play the next week , just do n't play it -- if you want to miss the @entity196 , fine			0
" but just do n't quit , do n't take such a radical decision only a few weeks after winning the biggest tournament in the world			1
