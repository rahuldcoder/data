-- scientists have found the oldest fossilized footprints made by a four - legged creature , forcing a rethink on when fish first crawled out of water and onto land			1
the discovery of the footprints in a former quarry in the @entity11 in southeastern @entity12 are thought to be 395 million years old -- 18 million years older than the earliest tetrapod ( a vertebrate with limbs rather than fins ) body fossils			1
the report published thursday in the science journal @entity20 says the footprints of the tetrapod measure up to 26 centimeters ( 10 inches ) wide , which scientists say is indicative of an animal around 2.5 meters ( 7.5 feet ) in length			2
the footprints are also 10 million years older than the earliest known elpistostegids -- creatures which displayed some animal characteristics but retained fins			1
@entity33 from the @entity34 in @entity35 , the reviewer of the paper , told @entity0 : " it is a really stunning discovery because it 's the earliest evidence we have of tetrapods			2
these footprints are clear enough to attest that tetrapods were there 395 millions years ago			1
" the report 's authors say their findings " force a radical reassessment of the timing , ecology and environmental setting of the fish - tetrapod transition , as well as the completeness of the body fossil record			2
" as well as finding fossilized footprints , @entity52 , professor of evolutionary organismal biology at @entity54 in @entity55 , and his co-authors from the @entity57 in @entity58 also report finding several tracks of different sizes and characteristics			1
the tracks , they say , have distinctive " hand " and " foot " prints and no evidence of a dragging body			0
@entity70 said in a video on the nature web site : " the trackway shows pairs of prints -- the sort of tracks a salamander would leave if it walked			0
in order to make tracks like the ones found you need to have front legs and back legs that are about the same size			1
" @entity70 said the disused quarry where the fossils were discovered has yielded some of the most exciting finds he has encountered in his career as a paleontologist			0
although @entity33 describes the lack of skeletal evidence as " frustrating , " it does n't undermine the importance of the discovery			0
" it changes what we thought about the evolutionary tree concerning the part dealing with transition from fish to land vertebrae			0
" the divergence between the tetrapods and their closest fish relatives is much younger than previously thought and it obliges us to find actual evidence -- skeletons or complete fossils -- in much earlier strata that could enlighten us between this divergence			0

fossilized footprints of 395 - million - year - old four - legged creature found in @entity12
@entity115 pushes the evolutionary scale back by nearly 20 million years
compared in significance to discovery of the first *miocene* *hominoids*
