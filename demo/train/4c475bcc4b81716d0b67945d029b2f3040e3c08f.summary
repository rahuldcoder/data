@entity0 , @entity1 -- instead of appealing for votes on the campaign trail , sen. @entity3 spent the weekend playing host at his rustic @entity1 home -- and on sunday members of the traveling press corps were his guests			1
it was a news - free zone , and a charm offensive to be sure -- but also a window into the private setting and self - described oasis of the man who may be days away from mathematically clinching the @entity18 nomination , months after being left for political dead			0
@entity3 greeted reporters as he tended to the grill -- tongs in hand -- on the deck of his ranch house			1
clad in a green @entity32 baseball hat , white sweat shirt with a photograph of his family on it , faded @entity34 jeans and @entity36 sneakers , the presidential candidate stood over two large , sizzling barbecues , preparing baby back ribs and grilled chicken			2
@entity3 revealed that barbecuing for guests is one of the few ways he relaxes , especially during the grueling campaign , and was eager to share his carefully honed recipe on the gas grill : baby back ribs ( bought at @entity47 ) , cooked bones down with a dry rub that 's a third garlic powder , a third salt and a third pepper			1
the trick to not letting it dry out ? keep putting lemon juice on , the senator said			0
when a print journalist tried to switch gears to more substantive issues , the candidate who tends to take questions from reporters on the road multiple times a day responded , " no interviews , this is a social event , " which also meant no news pictures or video			1
@entity3 's wife , @entity67 , and daughter @entity66 also were milling around as well as sen. @entity69 of @entity70 ; former sen. @entity71 of @entity72 and his wife , @entity73 ; @entity75 gov. @entity74 and his wife , @entity76 ; top @entity3 aide @entity77 ; and senior adviser @entity78			1
@entity3 took a break from the barbecue , where he was constantly cutting the sizzling meat and feeding reporters right from the grill , to give a short tour around his @entity86 property			1
@entity3 said the valley was settled by @entity88 and that the @entity86 got its name from the horseshoe shape of the creek that runs through the property			2
he said he built the first house on his property 24 years ago and now there are six houses on his lot			0
during a tour of the grounds , he peppered guests with wildlife information -- pointing out the black hawk nest overlooking the creek while talking about watching the mother teach the baby how to fly and joking about the woodpecker " condominium , " telling reporters that woodpeckers had to peck a different nest every year			0
he said there were 67 kinds of birds on the property and that they also had the occasional coyote or cougar			0
dinner was served on tables by @entity119 , which runs through the property			0
the menu included ribs , grilled chicken , hot dogs , bratwurst , hamburgers , beef tamales , couscous and pasta salad			0
a day earlier @entity3 hosted some of his closest political friends whose public endorsements and private advice helped propel his candidacy			2
that guest list included sen. @entity136 of @entity137 and @entity139 gov. @entity138			0
@entity3 was mum about his political guests , except to say he enjoyed sharing the ranch with people and that he did n't like solitude			1
after dinner , @entity3 showed the press into his living room , decorated with leather sofas , a painting of the @entity149 and a @entity151 rug tapestry			1
on the coffee table sat the @entity153 he received in 1999 , and the july 2005 @entity154 that featured the senator and his wife on the cover in their @entity159 home			0
also on the walls are framed paintings and pictures drawn by his children when they were young , something @entity3 said he very much enjoys and was " all @entity67 's idea			2
" @entity3 said the original architect went through some changes in fortune during construction that were evident in the structure of the house : when he was doing well , he would put in things such as a stained - glass window , but when times were lean , he would use exposed plywood			2
dessert was served on the deck to @entity180 tunes , one of the senator 's favorites , and @entity3 held court with reporters for a few more minutes , recalling some of the highlights of the 2008 campaign trail but not revealing anything about his future plans			1
e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
