@entity0 , @entity1 -- when disaster strikes and people are buried in rubble , there 's often no better search tool than a dog 's nose			1
it 's a valuable asset that has already been utilized several times this year			2
trained search dogs , along with their human handlers , have provided help in high - profile disasters such as the @entity16 earthquake in march and the @entity18 , @entity19 , tornado in may			1
" after a disaster , there is a window of opportunity for finding live people , " said @entity20 , founder of the @entity21			1
" the first eight hours are critical			0
" there are about 250 search - and - rescue teams , each made up of a dog and a handler , that are certified by the @entity32			1
but @entity33 says that 's half as many as there should be			2
" approximately 500 teams , i feel , would cover the country well for the hurricanes on the @entity40 , the great center of the country , which is bombarded and tormented with tornadoes , and the @entity44 , which can definitely anticipate earthquakes , " she said			1
" we should have about 500 teams , highly trained , strategically placed , ready to reach a disaster site within 12 hours			1
" since 1996 , @entity33 and her organization have been creating and training more of these teams			1
it starts by finding shelter dogs with the potential to become search dogs			1
then it trains the dogs and pairs them with a firefighter or rescue worker who will live , train and work with them			1
" @entity64 is the only group in the nation that gives a highly trained , professionally trained dog , to a handler and then stays with that handler for the rest of the team 's life together , " said @entity33 , 77			1
" we provide health insurance for the dog			0
... we provide food for the dog			0
the big thing is , we provide ongoing training for that dog and handler			2
" @entity33 's nonprofit has also streamlined the training process so that it can be done in about a year rather than the three or four years it once used to take			1
in all , the group has trained 131 teams around the country -- for free			1
it has responded to 80 missions around the world , including @entity16 , @entity18 , last year 's @entity91 earthquake and the september 11 attacks in @entity93			2
but it was a 1995 tragedy -- the federal building bombing in @entity96 -- that inspired @entity33 to create it			2
she and her black lab , @entity99 , had been training together for several years before they made the trip to @entity96 to help find victims			0
@entity33 had started the training as a hobby after retirement , and she and @entity99 were @entity32 - certified in 1994			2
after arriving in @entity96 , @entity33 said , she was devastated by the scope of the tragedy , in which 168 people were killed			0
one survivor was found by a dog , she said			0
later , @entity33 was surprised and outraged to learn that there were only about 15 similar canine teams in the country			1
" we are a huge nation , and this one building alone requires far more than 15 dogs that are highly trained , " @entity33 remembered thinking			1
" this nation is in a terrible situation			0
... " i said : " well , there 's only one thing to do			2
i either go back to my horseback riding in the hills , or i make a difference and find a better way to create canine disaster search teams for this nation			1
' " do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity130 the @entity21 receives no federal or state money			1
@entity33 said it 's funded by grants , donations , awards and corporate support			2
about 90 % of the dogs that it trains come from shelters			1
hundreds of dogs are tested each year for training , but only a small amount get selected			2
even fewer make it through the training			0
the dogs must have drive , focus and high energy , @entity33 said			2
@entity149 's dog , @entity150 , was a former shelter dog rejected by two foster homes because he was deemed too hyper to be a pet			0
but his search - and - rescue training " gave him a purpose , " @entity149 said , adding that @entity150 has become an important partner in his efforts as a firefighter			1
" ( @entity150 ) was able to focus the incessant drive ... that he had , and ( he was given ) an opportunity to really blossom as a dog rather than just being handed from home to home , " @entity149 said			0
the two recently helped with search - and - rescue efforts in @entity91 and @entity16			1
veteran handler @entity166 searched the @entity167 with her dog , @entity169 , after the september 11 attacks			0
" when i rounded that corner and was a little overwhelmed by the enormity of it , @entity169 had just the opposite effect , " @entity166 said			0
" she started pulling on the leash , saying : ' @entity176 ! we finally get to go to work			0
' ... she got very excited			0
" @entity33 said search efforts are usually fun for the dog " because they do n't get a paycheck			0
they get a toy , and the toy is their reward			0
" even after winning several awards for her work , @entity33 believes she is far from done			0
her foundation is building a national training center on 125 acres of @entity0 hills between @entity196 and @entity197			0
" in my heart , the number 168 is forever engraved , " she said			0
" i still want to train 168 canine disaster search teams -- one for each of the persons who died in @entity96			1
... " now , i see that it is possible -- it 's even likely -- within my lifetime			2
i wonder who number 168 will be			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity209 website at @entity210 and see how to help .			0
