the arduous search for a missing technology executive and five others feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed a mansion in @entity7 , @entity8 , could take days , fire officials said tuesday			1
the 16,000 - square - foot waterfront house belonged to executive @entity11 , chief operating officer for @entity12 , company spokesman @entity9 said			1
@entity11 was believed to have been at home with his wife , @entity15 , and four grandchildren			1
the sheer size of the structure and the fact that three - fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement , with piles of deep - seeded debris still smoldering , compounded the search , said @entity27 capt. @entity26 , who is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal @entity30			1
" your looking at five standard houses put together , " he said			0
" this is more of commercial fire than it is a residential fire			2
there are a lot of businesses that are n't 16,000 square feet			1
" @entity11 had not been heard from on monday , and his colleagues at @entity12 were " hoping for a miracle , " @entity1 affiliate @entity41 in @entity42 reported			1
by midday tuesday , fire officials had not been able to search the still - burning ruins , @entity26 said			1
heavy equipment is being moved in over the next 12 hours to aid in the search for victims and clues -- a process that could take days			1
" we have some very unique challenges with this house , " @entity26 said			2
" the construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials			2
we 're looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons			0
" when the first firefighters arrived on the scene early monday , they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town			0
but after interviews with relatives , it was determined that six members of the family were not accounted for , @entity27 fire officials said			2
" we still do not have 100 % proof that they 're in this house , " @entity26 said			0
fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. monday			0
the @entity30 national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious , @entity26 said			0
the burned - out home is being treated as a crime scene until investigators figure out the cause , he said			0
the @entity83 said crews had difficulty knocking down the blaze because the house is secluded , apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene			1
photos the fire department posted on @entity92 showed hoses stretched for long distances			0
capt. @entity95 , @entity27 fire spokesman , said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control			0

@entity11 told the @entity109 last year that after holding positions in a family business he decided to look for an " industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential			1
" he started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines , and later sold both hardware and software components for the @entity122			0
@entity11 told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions			2
in 1992 , the company went public and was sold to @entity128 five years later for $ 4.2 billion , according to the @entity109			0
