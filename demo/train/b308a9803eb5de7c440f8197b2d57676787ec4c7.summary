@entity0 -- @entity2 is a man on a mission			1
beginning thursday , the founder and head of the @entity6 can be seen driving a spluttering tractor called " justice " around @entity9 , pressing political leaders to provide funds to settle a discrimination case involving minority farmers			1
@entity2 , a fourth - generation black farmer himself , tells @entity1 that he wants @entity15 and the @entity17 administration to " step up " and deliver the money needed to fund the settlement			1
" we 've been waiting for years , " he said			1
" and when we entered into this settlement agreement back in february , the administration announced it like it was a done deal			2
" " they put out in the media that they were ' turning the page ' at the @entity28 , " @entity2 continued			0
" but the bottom line is that the black farmers do n't have the money			1
" the 1997 @entity33 case against the @entity34 @entity28 claimed that black farmers were systematically denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin			1
eleven years ago it was settled out of court			2
under a federal judge 's terms dating to 1999 , qualified farmers could receive $ 50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias			2
but tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims			2
then - senator @entity17 sponsored a measure in the @entity53 that reopened the case , known as @entity55 and in february , the @entity51 released a statement announcing a resolution to @entity55 but the statement said the settlement agreement was contingent on the appropriation of funds by @entity15			1
after that the @entity62 failed to approve funds already passed by the @entity64			2
@entity2 says the situation facing black farmers in the @entity34 is a " national disaster			1
they 're dying every day , i 'm going to more and more funerals every day			0
black farmers are dying when they were supposed to have received this settlement years ago			1
" " i decided to drive my trusty tractor here -- justice -- all over @entity0 , so people can see what a real farmer looks like , " @entity2 said , adding that he wants political leaders to understand " the lives they 're affecting when they deny justice			1
that 's what this is about			0
it 's about a group of people who 've proven their case in front of a court , who 've won time and time again in @entity15			1
now we have a bill , a passed bill , and @entity15 should enact it			1
we already have a hundred million dollars out there			0
where 's that at ? " @entity2 founded the non-profit @entity97 in 1995			0
he 's worked to represent the rights of minority farmers since the 1990s , meeting with all sorts of political figures , from lowly bureaucrats to presidents			2
and this is n't the first time he 's mounted a somewhat unique , farm - oriented action in the @entity34 capitol , either			2
he 's driven an older tractor into @entity0 from his @entity110 farm before			1
he 's also driven a mule and wagon into the city as well			0
he chose this tactic because he says the black farmers " are just marched out			1
you know they 're older now , they 're dying			0
and we 're trying to get more young people involved in agriculture and farming and it 's been difficult			0
even my own son who really should ... has n't expressed any interest in ( farming )			0
and deep down i know it 's because he watched how damn bad i suffered with the government and how bad the government treated us , you know with getting loans and things of that nature			0
so i know that 's really what it is			0
of course he 's never said that to me , but i know really what that is			0
" now , @entity2 says he hopes to remain in @entity0 until a bill is passed funding the settlement			1
he says he will visit the @entity64 friday morning to talk about what he believes the @entity17 administration can do to " push this thing along			0
" he says he is considering making stops at the @entity34 @entity148 , along with the headquarters of both the @entity150 and the @entity151			0
@entity2 says he 'll put his question to leaders of all stripes : " why ca n't we get this done if we have the support they say we do amongst @entity158 and @entity159 and the president ? why are we still out here chasing our tail in the @entity62 , begging and pleading for leaders to do the right thing ? " ultimately , however , @entity2 says his protest is for everyone			2
" there are other bills that are pending , " he says			0
" it 's time for @entity15 and leaders in the @entity62 to start working for the @entity34 people and that includes the black farmers , too			1
" @entity1 's @entity173 contributed to this report			0
