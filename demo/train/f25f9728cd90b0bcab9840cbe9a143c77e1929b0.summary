-- if you 're a @entity3 fan , chances are you spent may 13 escaping with some of his new music			0
the @entity3 's posthumous album , " @entity7 , " officially landed tuesday after weeks of anticipation , and critics have been generally pleased			1
the disc features eight never - before - heard @entity3 songs that have been finished by a crew of producers led by the prolific @entity14			1
using an array of tracks that were worked on from 1983 to 1999 , " @entity7 " digs into @entity3 's archives and updates the music to make it sound like a contemporary release			1
in a review , @entity21 reassures the curious that the album is worth a listen , adding that " it 's better than you think , " primarily because @entity3 's vocal talents are " front and center			1
" @entity29 gives the record a more reserved three and a half stars , calling the track " @entity33 " a standout			0
" ( the song ) follows the wonderful , breezy legacy of ' @entity37 ' and ' @entity38 , ' but it 's an exception : most of these songs rot and sway with fear , " the review says			0
" even with such dark subject matter , though , it 's a joy to hear the joy in @entity3 's voice			1
" the artist died at 50 in 2009 and , as the @entity48 points out in its review , a " contemporized " album such as " @entity7 " can only do so much to sate a fan 's desire to hear new music			2
while " ' @entity7 ' does polish up these old songs , " the @entity48 observes , it 's also " clear why @entity3 shelved ( them )			2
they 're near misses , either not quite as striking as what he released or lesser examples of ideas he exploited better elsewhere			0
" the @entity65 's @entity64 found the effort to be lacking in coherence , but does believe it 's a sound reminder of why " @entity3 was once pop 's premier genius , still cited by the likes of @entity73 and @entity74 , " the review notes			0
" you could even say it 's a fitting bookend to the man 's career			0
