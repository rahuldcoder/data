there were a number of grim surprises from the recent terrorist attacks in @entity5 , including their brutality , the inability of @entity9 intelligence to track known jihadis , and now of course the puzzling , indeed incomprehensible , fact that the @entity13 administration failed to send a high level representative to yesterday 's national anti-terror rally in @entity5			1
secretary of state @entity16 will visit @entity5 later this week , but that the administration could have been so tone deaf in missing a this weekend 's chance to highlight its concerns over an issue critical to @entity21 and @entity23 's own security -- is a stunning oversight			1
it suggests an inability to see the @entity5 attacks in their proper perspective -- although doing so is admittedly no easy matter only days afterward			1
as @entity31 and others process those events , there are takeaways that should guide their thinking in the period ahead			0
they include : do n't panic the jihadis are n't taking over the world			1
after 9/11 , many had an overriding sense that more successful attacks would follow			0
in fact both in @entity21 and the @entity23 , it 's stunning how few successful attacks directed by foreign terrorist organizations there have been ( not one since 2005 in @entity21 ; and not one since 9/11 in the @entity23 ) last year , there were 17,958 global fatalities to terror , according to the @entity53 's @entity52			2
among them , there were 16 @entity23			0
almost 82 % of the terrorist attacks happened in only five countries : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
but do n't trivialize terrorism emerging from the @entity65 and @entity66 world , along with weapons of mass destruction , may well be to the 21st century what the cold war was to last century : the international community 's defining national security challenge			1
just look what else occurred over the past week or so : 2,000 people were killed by @entity76 's savagery			2
there 's no winning the battle against jihadi terror or " ultimately defeating " it			2
a perfect storm of jihadi fantasies driven by hatred and triumphalism , and growing @entity86 - @entity85 divisions , have combined with a dysfunctional @entity65 world that offers up either no governance or bad governance			1
and this will continue to produce alienation , radicalization and violence			0
the war on jihadi terrorism really is a war ; but of a generational character			0
it will be with us for years to come			0
we can contain , preempt and try to prevent it			0
but we can not hermetically seal our borders or eliminate our vulnerability without undermining and sacrificing our freedoms and way of life do n't romanticize the outpouring of goodwill and solidarity that has followed the @entity5 attacks is an encouraging sign			1
and if it leads to greater international resolve , more effective security cooperation , smart counter-terrorism and an effort in @entity9 -- and in @entity21 -- to reduce discrimination against @entity66 and promote greater acceptance of @entity116 , it will help contain the jihadi threat			1
but you do n't change a nation in a single traumatic act			2
@entity122 did n't do it ; @entity124 did n't ; @entity125 did n't			2
and the @entity5 attacks wo n't either			1
anti-muslim and anti-immigration sentiment , along with the rise of the far right , has been developing for years			0
a new tolerance wo n't come easy			2
ironically , the same democratic values and freedom of expression and movement that the @entity134 defends will be used by jihadis -- and the alienated @entity66 communities on which they feed -- to sustain their radical effort			1
do n't let @entity66 and @entity65 off the hook @entity65 governments , the @entity141 , the head of @entity143 in @entity144 and various @entity66 clerics have issued statements denouncing the @entity5 attacks , and various @entity65 and @entity66 leaders attended yesterday 's national rally in @entity5			1
all of this is important			0
but let 's be clear : for far too long a disturbing minority of @entity65 and @entity66 have hijacked a religion in the service of a radical jihad			1
and as they did this , too many other @entity66 have been passive , silent , and acquiescent , failing to condemn them and thus allowing them latitude to operate			1
@entity65 governments have sometimes repressed jihadi ideology , but other times -- as in the case of @entity161 , itself a victim of terror -- tried to accommodate it			1
meanwhile anti-semitic cartoons and tropes routinely circulate in the @entity65 and @entity66 press			1
there is an ongoing struggle within @entity170 between @entity85 and @entity86 , moderates and radicals , modernists and traditionalists that is far from being resolved			0
@entity170 's reformation is nowhere near at hand			0
and until there is a clearer separation between religion and the state , better governance , respect for freedom of expression and freedom of conscience , and genuine tolerance and regard for minority rights , radicalism will flourish			0
no @entity23 narrative or externally generated reform effort can delegitimize the jihadis ; only the @entity66 themselves can do that			2
do n't just externalize the failures of @entity65 and @entity66 governments are to blame for jihadi terror			1
but there 's no doubt that @entity203 policies and practices have made an already bad situation worse			0
it is the cruelest of ironies that the @entity23 -- the victim of mass terror on 9/11 -- helped enable the jihadis further with its ill - considered and unwise invasion of @entity59			0
one result was the creation of @entity214			0
anger toward the @entity134 runs deep in this broken and dysfunctional region			1
@entity23 relationships with allies , such as @entity161 and @entity219 , feed the jihadi narrative , as do effective counterterrorism methods such as drone strikes that that kill innocents and often and alienate the mainstream @entity66 as well			2
@entity23 is in a no - win situation			0
whatever else we try to achieve in this broken , angry , and dysfunctional region , our overriding goal must be to prevent attacks on the @entity23 and help our allies do the same			0
what happened in @entity5 is a tragic reminder of how challenging this will be .			2

@entity234 : @entity13 's *absence* from @entity5 was tone deaf
he says one lesson of attack : do n't let @entity65 , @entity66 nations tolerant of jihad off the hook
@entity234 : anger of some in @entity66 world at @entity134 ca n't be trivialized . it 's challenge of our time
