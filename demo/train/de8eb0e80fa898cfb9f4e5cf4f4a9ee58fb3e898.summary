-- there are no easy answers when journalists have to decide how to cover a terrorist group 's video			2
the issue resurfaced tuesday when a member of the @entity9 extremist group @entity8 was shown on camera beheading @entity12 journalist @entity11			1
no major news organization showed the gruesome conclusion of the @entity8 video , but many did show screen grabs and short video clips of @entity11 and the executioner , as well as another hostage that @entity8 is threatening to kill			1
the video is newsworthy -- even if it also plays into the propagandistic hands of the people who produced it			0
but a vocal flock of viewers and readers -- and some fellow journalists -- have deplored the decisions to show snippets of the video , reprising arguments that were made in august when news organizations showed screen grabs of @entity35 , another @entity12 journalist who was beheaded by @entity8			1
" ca n't believe this bears repeating , but one should not empower @entity8 by publishing their pr materials , " freelance journalist @entity36 wrote on @entity37 after the @entity11 video emerged			1
one major international broadcaster , @entity42 , said it had decided not to show any images of @entity11 from the video -- a more conservative position than other television networks			1
" we suggest all media do the same , " @entity42 's public relations account said via @entity37 , using the hashtag # @entity48			0
not showing the video at all , however , risks sanitizing the grim reality of the world			1
so most media outlets tried to strike a balance			0
@entity8 " would like us to show you the most graphic images on that video , as part of their campaign of terror			2
we will not , " @entity64 anchor @entity63 said as he introduced a segment about @entity11 's death			0
instead , @entity64 showed only video clips from it			0
media figures also tried to demonstrate some self - awareness when dealing with the issue			0
" no way to avoid leading the show with @entity8 butchery and yet , maddeningly , that also seems like what @entity8 wants , " @entity72 wrote on @entity37 before his 8 p.m. @entity74 program			2
newscasts tended to show more photos of @entity11 in the field , reporting on stories throughout the @entity84 , than of him as a hostage			2
but screen grabs from the video were still widespread , including on @entity0 's homepage and television networks			0
the @entity35 video surfaced on the social media website @entity92 , as reported by @entity93 , a blog on terrorism and extremism run by the @entity97			0
it was later put on @entity99 and promoted via @entity37			0
the @entity11 video was discovered on an unidentified file - sharing website by the @entity97 , which researches terrorist threats			1
perhaps that 's why social media reactions to the @entity11 video were more muted -- or perhaps , terribly , it 's because the shock value was diminished the second time around .			1

no major news organization showed the conclusion of the @entity8 @entity11 video
some viewers , readers and journalists have deplored decisions to show snippets of it
" one should not empower @entity8 by publishing their pr materials , " a journalist tweets
not showing the video at all , however , risks sanitizing the grim reality of the world
