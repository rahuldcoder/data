the @entity0 unanimously passed tougher sanctions against @entity2 thursday targeting the secretive nation 's nuclear program hours after @entity5 threatened a possible " preemptive nuclear attack			1
" " these sanctions will bite , and bite hard , " @entity8 ambassador to the @entity10 @entity9 said after the vote			1
@entity13 , @entity2 's key ally , could have used its veto power to block the sanctions			1
instead , after weeks of negotiating , it signed on to the final draft			0
" @entity13 is a country of principle , " @entity13 's @entity10 ambassador @entity19 said			1
" we are firmly committed to safeguarding peace and stability on the @entity24			1
" leading up to the vote , @entity5 ratcheted up its bellicose rhetoric			0
a spokesman for the @entity29 foreign ministry suggested the @entity8 " is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war			2
" as a result , @entity2 " will exercise the right to a preemptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country , " the country said in a statement carried by the state - run @entity34			2
despite the strong language , analysts say @entity2 is years away from having the technology necessary to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile and aim it accurately at a target			2
and , analysts say , @entity2 is unlikely to seek a direct military conflict with the @entity8 , preferring instead to try to gain traction through threats and the buildup of its military deterrent			1
but the threat came amid increased concern over @entity5 's dogged efforts to advance its nuclear and missile technology after a recent long - range rocket launch and underground atomic blast			0
on tuesday , @entity2 said it planned to scrap the armistice that stopped the @entity62 in 1953 and warned it could carry out strikes against the @entity8 and @entity65			2
analysts : ' boxed in ' @entity2 's bluster ' particularly dangerous ' the rhetoric came not only in advance of the @entity10 vote , but also as military drills take place on either side of the heavily armed border that divides the two @entity75			1
this week , the @entity8 and @entity65 began two months of joint exercises , known as @entity77			2
@entity2 has called the annual training exercises " an open declaration of a war , " but @entity65 says it notified @entity5 that the drills " are defensive in nature			2
" @entity2 's nuclear threat thursday " may suggest that @entity5 feels even more boxed in than usual , " said @entity83 of the @entity84			1
and while a nuclear attack itself is not an immediate palpable threat , " this surge in provocative rhetoric is particularly dangerous , " added @entity89 , also with the institute			0
" @entity65 's new president ( @entity93 ) ca n't be seen to back down in the face of the @entity2 's threats , while ( new @entity29 leader ) @entity96 may feel that his successful missile and nuclear tests give him the ability to keep pressuring @entity101			1
the two may wind up talking themselves into conflict			0
" @entity65 's @entity10 ambassador @entity104 said thursday the new resolution " reflects the will of the international community , " which " will never tolerate @entity2 's repeated violations and @entity2 's nuclear and ballistic missile program			1
" " each violation will be met by stronger responses and measures , " he added			0
will the new sanctions work ? the goal of the new sanctions is to stymie the activities of @entity29 banks and cash couriers who might be funneling money to the secretive regime 's nuclear and missile programs			2
it will be tougher for the regime to move large sums of cash stuffed into suitcases , @entity124 said			2
the @entity10 resolution also outlines measures to step up scrutiny of suspicious sea shipments and air cargo			1
and it expands restrictions to encompass several institutions and senior officials in the @entity2 's weapons industry , as well as a range of materials and technology known to be used in uranium enrichment			1
it also blocks the sale of luxury goods -- such as yachts and certain high - end jewelry -- to @entity2			2
" as a result , @entity2 's ruling elite , who have been living large while impoverishing their people , will pay a price " for the ongoing nuclear activities , @entity124 said			1
some doubt whether the new measures will make much difference			0
sanctions imposed after previous nuclear tests and rocket launches have failed to deter @entity5			0
@entity13 will go a long way toward determining whether the new sanctions really do have " bite , " analysts say			1
" as long as @entity13 allows @entity2 to operate , as long as @entity13 provides food , energy assistance , and investment , the sanctions really do n't matter , " said @entity165 of the @entity166			1
@entity2 notoriously allows many of its people to live in malnutrition and starvation			0
still , the country needs a functioning economy , partly to finance its military , @entity165 explained			0
" @entity96 is now paying the price for going ahead with a nuclear test despite @entity13 warnings not to create trouble during the political transition that has been under way in @entity188 the past year , " @entity177 , director of the non-proliferation and @entity179 at the @entity181 - based @entity180 , said this week			0
future levels of @entity13 grain sales to @entity2 are a possible indicator of @entity188 's commitment to putting meaningful pressure on @entity5 , he said			1
@entity194 , an analyst with @entity195 , said the new sanctions wo n't deter @entity2 from building up its nuclear program			1
" @entity2 last year inserted language into its constitution that the country is a nuclear power			0
to walk back from this , especially under pressure from the outside world , would undermine @entity96 's legitimacy and make him vulnerable			0
he will not do this , " said @entity194			0
@entity2 casts @entity10 sanctions as part of an aggressive , @entity8 - led conspiracy against it			1
simmering tensions @entity2 said the underground nuclear blast it conducted february 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller , lighter device , suggesting advances in its weapons program			0
it was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since @entity96 inherited power in december 2011 after the death of his father , @entity219 , who made building up @entity2 's military strength the focus of his 17 - year rule			1
the test followed the @entity2 's long - range rocket launch in december that succeeded in putting an object in orbit			1
@entity5 insisted the launch had peaceful aims , but it was widely viewed as a test of its ballistic missile technology			0
long history @entity2 have technically been at war for decades			0
the 1950 - 53 civil war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty			0
@entity13 supported the @entity2 with materiel and troops in the @entity62			2
the @entity8 backed the @entity65 in the conflict , with soldiers from the two countries fighting side by side			0
about 28,500 @entity8 soldiers are currently stationed in @entity65 .			0

@entity8 ambassador @entity124 : the sanctions will " bite hard "
@entity13 is " firmly committed " to peace on the @entity24 , ambassador to @entity10 says
the resolution will clamp down on @entity2 's officials , banks and cargo
analysts say @entity13 is a key to determining whether the sanctions deter @entity2
