even after @entity0 apologized for what he called his " insensitive " comment about scheduling a c - section before the season started , his suggestion plus critical stances by other radio hosts demonstrate how much paternity leave is still not widely accepted in our society			1
in conversations with men across the country , it 's clear that while most join many women in expressing outrage at the view that a @entity20 game should come before the birth of a child , there were men who felt the player should have gotten back to his job as quickly as possible			1
by now , you probably know the particulars : the @entity29 ' @entity28 missed the first two games of the season to attend his son 's birth			2
he did n't do anything he was n't allowed to do			0
@entity20 permits a player to take up to three days off for paternity leave			1
but @entity0 , his radio co-host @entity37 and another @entity39 radio host , @entity40 , had a very hard time understanding why @entity28 would take another day -- and be off the field -- after his son was born			1
" you 're a @entity20 player			2
you can hire a nurse , " said @entity40 on his radio show			0
@entity0 pulled back completely from his initial comment that if he were in @entity28 's shoes , he would have had his wife schedule a c - section before the season started			1
" my flippant comment was insensitive , " said @entity0 on his radio show friday , a day after intense criticism of his remarks			1
" i feel terrible for the @entity28 family because what should be the greatest time in their life turned out to be somewhat of a firestorm that i personally put them into			0
and for that , hopefully , they can find forgiveness in their heart			0
" a father of three , who did not want to be identified , said his biggest beef was not with @entity0 but with @entity40 's comments that @entity28 was n't needed after his son 's birth , or that anything he could have done could have been handled by a hired nurse			1
" that is total garbage , " said this dad via @entity73			0
" whether a man makes minimum wage or the salary of a @entity20 ball player , his family deserves his undivided attention at the birth of his child			0
it does n't matter if he can easily hire someone to handle all the things that need to be done -- there is no substitute for the sense of accomplishment a man can get from having done it himself			0
" @entity93 , a stay - at - home dad in @entity94 , writer and author of " @entity97 , " found the comments of @entity0 and the other radio hosts " really sad " but believes the fact that the controversy involves a discussion about paternity leave is positive			1
" i 'd like to think that if there 's a silver lining from all this , it 's the realization or the confirmation that dads do want to be involved , and that the expectation is really gone away from wandering around the hallways handing out cigars to wanting to be in the birth room and being involved and hands - on from the get - go , " said @entity93 , who has another book coming out in a few weeks , " @entity105			2
" but not all men think a man 's role is being by his wife and his new child 's side			2
on @entity127 's @entity73 page , a man named @entity125 said he agreed with @entity0 regarding scheduling a c - section before the season got underway			1
" it may seem insensitive but it 's a very special situation being a @entity20 player			2
i know in almost every other profession the right thing to do is to strap your boots on and go back to work because that 's what the man of the house does			0
" could he not afford to hire a nurse to wait on his wife hand and foot ? " he added			0
" real men do n't take paternity leave , " said a man named @entity146 on @entity127 's facebook page			1
when pressed by another commenter that it 's no longer the 1950s , @entity146 responded , " i wish it were the ' 50s			0
those were the days when men were men			2
" said another man on @entity73 , " my belief is that it 's a generation gap opinion			0
when ( @entity0 ) had kids , he was back to work the next day			2
" indeed , just by looking at the increase in the number of stay - at - home dads in the @entity162 , it 's clear our attitudes are shifting , even though not as rapidly as some would hope			1
" i think people have really latched onto the idea that no , culturally we 've changed , and we want to go in the direction of more involved dads as opposed to backwards of ' @entity173 ' checking in from out in the waiting room , " said @entity93 , who is the primary caregiver for his soon - to - be 8 - year - old daughter			0
still , when compared to our @entity176 counterparts , we are pretty much in the dark ages as far as paternity leave is concerned			1
in @entity180 , men get a minimum of two months paid paternity leave ; in @entity183 , they can take 10 weeks paid ; and in @entity184 , they get four weeks			1
in the @entity162 , there is no mandated paid paternity leave , although some companies do allow men to take 10 days off with pay			1
" in my case , i had to use vacation days when my twins were born , " said the father of three , who did n't want to be identified			0
" i get that we live in a world where women are n't treated equally to men when it comes to pay , promotions and a slew of other areas , but there are also areas where men 's needs are treated as inferior to those of a woman , and becoming a parent is a prime example , " he added			2
will we , one day , get to a place where paternity leave is as accepted as maternity leave ? even paternity leave supporters say that 's not likely			1
" from a cold hard political standpoint , for some reason , we just feel like you take time off and you 're a loafer , you 're a taker , ( a ) grabber , " said @entity93			0
but as more @entity214 come forward and make decisions that they say are best for their families , maybe , just maybe , we 'll move closer to the approach of our friends abroad			0
@entity93 said , " in terms of just being socially good for everybody ... having kids raised in a loving family and to start them from the get - go with two involved parents ... i do n't see how that could possibly be bad and i hope that one day we can get there			0
" do you think men should be able to take paternity leave -- no matter their profession ? chime in in the comments or tell @entity232 on @entity233 or @entity127 on @entity73 .			1
