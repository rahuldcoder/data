-- the @entity2 headline said it all : " rep. @entity4 fails to close @entity5			2
" when this became @entity4 's job , or whether his now " controversial " @entity9 op - ed was even an attempt at doing that , is anyone 's guess			1
but once again , @entity14 have decided to cannibalize themselves viciously and needlessly instead of uniting over common goals			0
to be clear , the divide on the right is n't over policy			0
no @entity5 i 've met thinks @entity20 is good legislation			2
no one is suggesting capitulation on the debt ceiling			0
everyone wants spending cuts , entitlement reform and deficit reduction			0
where we 're divided is over tactics			0
incidentally , @entity4 hinted at this in september to @entity32 : " yeah , there 's a bit of frustration			2
... we all believe the same thing , we all want to achieve the same goal , and so we should n't be questioning each other 's conservatism over tactical disagreements			2
" guess no one on team @entity41 got that message			2
after @entity4 's op - ed , which pushed for a strong - willed fight for entitlement reform in exchange for raising the debt ceiling , failed to mention the unholiest of @entity51 holies , @entity20 , he was nailed to a proverbial cross by @entity41 defenders , who then immediately told everyone at @entity55 -- or on @entity56 -- of his betrayal			1
@entity41 speechwriter @entity58 tweeted , " there is one big word missing from this op - ed. it 's start ( sic ) with an o and ends with @entity62			2
" @entity64 spokesman @entity63 was similarly snarky : " much like @entity66 press , @entity4 does n't mention @entity20 in @entity9 oped			1
" over on @entity70 , @entity69 posted the questions , " so we are going to ditch the fight over @entity20 , which is extremely unpopular , to fight for @entity74 reform ? really , @entity4 ? and they think we are politically stupid ? " now , nowhere in @entity4 's op - ed does he suggest ditching the fight over @entity20			1
as @entity41 's cheerleaders point out , @entity4 does n't even mention the health care law			1
but the thing that defies logic ( and good manners ) is the necessity of this kind of puerile bullying			0
@entity4 's plan is n't in competition with or heretical to @entity41 's message			1
it 's simply another objective conservatives should fight for , both in the short term and the long term			0
furthermore , the sniping is just unseemly , and frankly , @entity41 's defenders are only managing to make @entity4 look like the grown - up			1
i do n't recall @entity4 jumping into the fray when plenty of @entity14 were criticizing the strategy to defund @entity20 -- a position by @entity41 that i have applauded as heroic			1
when sens. @entity99 and @entity100 and rep. @entity101 were scolding @entity41 for a plan they knew was ill - fated , @entity4 was virtually silent on the move			1
this , even though @entity41 has never been shy about his disdain for @entity14			0
back in march , @entity41 criticized @entity4 's budget plan for its @entity74 cuts			1
and he 's made it clear he does n't trust @entity109 when it comes to budget negotiations			0
it 's hard to argue that @entity4 is n't a staunch conservative			1
to treat him like a traitor is preposterous and unproductive			0
and while i admire @entity41 's conviction , and stand by his commitment to peel back a program as odious and ruinous as the @entity20 , he has to learn to work with others on his own team			1
the @entity2 headline is n't accurate			0
instead of reading " rep. @entity4 fails to close @entity123 divide " it should read " @entity125 republicans apart			2
" if he keeps it up , he 'll lose people like me who are with him on the policy , but quickly losing patience for his tactics			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			0

@entity134 : @entity4 's *proposal* on entitlements has been *attacked* by @entity41 backers
she says @entity4 is *pursuing* the worthy goal of reforming entitlement programs
@entity134 supports @entity41 's effort to defund @entity20 but says @entity4 's plan is n't in conflict
she says @entity123 should n't get *locked* into *internal* battle over tactics
