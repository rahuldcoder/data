@entity1 assignment producer @entity0 recently opened up about his @entity3 's syndrome , saying , " for the most part , i am just like you , just a bit quirky			1
all right , a lot quirky			1
" like @entity0 , @entity1 's readers are worried about the unsubstantiated connection being made between autism and violence in the wake of the @entity13 school shooting			1
they posted more than 700 comments in support of @entity0 and their loved ones with @entity3 's			1
here are some of the most popular comments			1
some have been edited for clarity and space			1
@entity22 : my son had no friends			2
no one stood up for him			2
children and adults alike were very cruel to him and would even take a step or two backwards when they first met him , as if they could catch @entity3 's from him			1
they shunned him , refused to allow him to participate in social groups , and taunted him mercilessly			2
in the end , he killed himself			2
he was my hero and my best friend			2
@entity37 : to this day these conditions ( @entity3 , autism , @entity40 , depression , @entity43 syndrome , etc. ) are not understood			1
the social problems continue to this day and our children are at the mercy of cruel , ignorant children and adults who have little empathy for anyone who is " different			1
@entity53 : i , too , have a son with a disability			2
most people try to pretend he is n't really in the room			2
he is bright and fully understands his situation and what is going on around him , but nobody treats him that way in public			2
they stare , smile at us and keep walking by			2
even friends do n't know how to talk to him			2
it 's up to us to teach them that he is capable of a relationship and wants to be normal			1
@entity73 : one of my best friends has @entity3 's , and he is one of the most marvelous and amazing human beings that ever set foot on this earth			1
sheryll @entity80 : i 'm not happy with the word " disorder			2
" ... psychiatrists come from the medical profession and , thus , tend to look through " medical model " eyes			2
meaning that they look for pathology , not for the strengths , creativity , quirkiness , as delight parts of the character			0
disorder sounds like something that is needed to be solved , ordered , healed or recovered from			0
i think of it as a style -- more , a set of traps and talents which one can learn from			0
@entity101 : this will be my fourth @entity103 without my son			0
he too had his issues			0
... he took his own life at school in front of a couple hundred students			0
i have a daughter as well who is now diagnosed bipolar , and two other children with @entity3 's symptoms			1
it can be exhausting dealing with all the social fallout and rejection they have all experienced			0
... if it was n't for my faith in @entity120 , i can honestly say that i would probably not be here			0
@entity121 : autistic people are also more likely to be the victim of bullying and violence , rather than be the perpetrators of it			1
@entity128 : @entity129 , too , have @entity3 's			1
... i think that the main thing people need to understand is that @entity3 's / autism is not a mental disorder			1
it does not mean that we can not process thoughts or understand consequences			0
truth is , we generally overanalyze thoughts and consequences			0
@entity141 : my @entity3 son , now an adult , and i were discussing the multitude of new @entity3 diagnoses -- seemingly more each year -- and he stopped for a minute and pondered , " did you ever think that what they are calling @entity3 's is really just a new stage of human evolution -- the enhancements ? " the ability to focus so intently and learn			1
it is worth a thought			0
@entity155 : like you , i learned about my @entity3 's as an adult			1
like you , i learned how to behave through mimicking others , and like you , i still have challenges but ( am ) finding my own way			0
and i have encouraged my children to do the same			0
@entity163 : as someone with @entity3 's myself , the idea that we use it as a cop - out is disturbing			1
often @entity3 's means we put more work into a single few words then most people do during an entire conversation			1
@entity173 : my youngest has @entity3 's ; he 's in his 20s now and blooming			1
like the author he has turned his " quirks " into advantages			0
in his case he is a phenomenal cook -- because he is so focused that he turns out phenomenal and artful plates , every time			0
@entity182 : my younger brother has @entity3 's			1
he is 17 , and he is my best friend			0
... because of him i have learned to be understanding and to listen			0
he can not tell a lie ; his mind does not understand them			0
he is the must trustworthy person i know			0
he would help anyone in a heartbeat			0
@entity190 : this is wonderful that someone would be so unashamedly brave and honest			0
it 's also sad that it 's " brave " to say that we have @entity3 's			1
it should n't be taboo , and it should n't be labeled as directly connected to violence			1
i am very grateful to this journalist			0
may we all be so courageous ; then one day , other autistic people wo n't have to be			0
@entity200 ( @entity201 ) : these kids are not disabled , they are not special education			0
they think and learn by hands - on , visual and auditory methods -- they want to know the hows and whys -- and do poorly ( usually ) with the sit still and memorize fact - on - fact methods			0
the kids usually have high iq 's -- they just learn in a different way			1
disqus_868zf2ccld : now that i know i have @entity3 's , life is so much better			1
@entity214 does not make it easier for me to make a phone call or answer one , but at least i now know that there is a reason i have such a hard time with something so simple .			0
