-- @entity1 has announced a major algorithmic change to its search engine , subtle in nature and perhaps unnoticeable to many users , but one that should dramatically improve the quality of @entity1 's search results			2
with this move , @entity1 is targeting content farms -- a common name for low quality sites whose main goal is to attract search traffic by piling up ( mostly ) useless content , usually by either producing large amounts of low - quality text or by copying it from websites with original content			1
@entity1 does not go into details of the change which should impact 11.8 percent of @entity1 's queries ( currently only in the @entity23 , with plans to roll it out elsewhere over time ) , but it does say that it will affect the ranking of many sites on the web			1
" this update is designed to reduce rankings for low - quality sites -- sites which are low - value add for users , copy content from other websites or sites that are just not very useful			0
at the same time , it will provide better rankings for high - quality sites -- sites with original content and information such as research , in - depth reports , thoughtful analysis and so on , " explain @entity39 @entity38 and @entity40 a blog post			0
while the change will surely have many website owners up in arms , complaining that their website was unfairly ranked lower than before ( we 're sure that in some cases they will be right ) , it 's a very welcome one			0
the popularity of @entity1 's search engine is still second to none , but @entity1 has been plagued by black hat seo practices and content farms for a while now , with thecomplaints from users slowly mounting over time			1
if @entity1 manages to put an end to content farms or at least significantly reduce their influence in search results , it will be an important step in regaining the trust of its millions of users			0
