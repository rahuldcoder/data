-- @entity2 's national football team may have been smoked on the pitch by @entity4 , but now government officials are claiming a 2014 @entity7 victory of another sort			1
according to figures released this week by @entity2 's federal government , the @entity7 was a triumph for the country 's transportation and tourism industries			1
" we lost the trophy , but @entity2 won the @entity7 , " said @entity15 , @entity2 president @entity16 's chief of staff , in a statement			1
" @entity2 showed that they know how to win , lose , host and celebrate peace with respect and a ' make yourself at home ' atmosphere that won the world over			2
" according to government figures , 1 million foreign tourists visited @entity2 during the month - long event , far exceeding its @entity32 projection of 600,000 visitors coming to the country from abroad			1
about 3 million @entity2 traveled around the country during the event , just short of the expected 3.1 million			1
additionally , according to the government , of the million foreign visitors , " 95 % of them said they intend to return			2
" " we were saying that we would host the @entity7 of @entity43 , " said president @entity16 in a statement			2
" indeed , we staged the @entity7 of @entity43			2
" we had one problem , our match against @entity4			0
however ... we beat the pessimistic predictions and hosted the @entity7 of @entity43 with the immense and wonderful contribution of our people			0
" not everyone on board the government 's assessment of the @entity7 's impact on travel was significantly more enthusiastic than a report last week in the @entity56 that called the event " a bust for @entity2 's domestic travel industry			1
" citing figures from the @entity62 , that story projected total air travel in @entity2 falling 11 % to 15 % during the @entity7 compared with the same period in 2013			1
the story blamed hiked - up prices and large crowds for scaring off domestic tourists			0
economists who study the impact of large sporting and other events on local and national economies tend to be less sanguine than the governments that host them			0
" every time you get a @entity7 tourist you get one less regular tourist , " dr. @entity75 , a sports economist and economics professor at @entity77 in @entity78 , tells @entity0			2
" generally speaking , the @entity7 does not benefit the host 's tourism industry			1
" @entity75 says it 's doubtful @entity2 's international tourism profile will experience long - term positive impact as a result of the @entity7			1
he points to heightened media coverage around the event that focused on " unsavory conditions " facing the country , such as violence , poverty , pollution and social unrest , as illustrated by public demonstrations against the huge amounts of public funds spent on new infrastructure			0
furthermore , he said , the @entity7 wo n't provide sustained promotion for the smaller of the event 's 12 host cities			1
the @entity104 city of @entity105 is an example			0
@entity75 cited public money spent on a stadium that will eventually become underutilized			0
rather than inspire coverage of the beauty of the surrounding @entity112 , media reports tended to focus on the new facility and the conflict that surrounded its construction			0
" it 's very hard to see how that 's going to promote tourism in @entity105 , " says @entity75			0
more where that came from turning mega-sporting events such as the @entity7 and @entity122 into proxy tourism campaigns remains an uncertain enterprise			2
some cities continue to reap the benefits of hosting			0
@entity128 has seen a tenfold increase in tourist numbers since it hosted the @entity131			0
meanwhile , a decade after hosting the 2004 summer games , @entity122 venues in @entity133 have become decaying ghost towns			0
for now , it 's unlikely there will be enough time to assess the long - term economic impact of the @entity7 on @entity2 's economy in advance of the country 's next huge event -- the @entity144 in @entity145 .			1

@entity4 ? who 's @entity4 ?
@entity2 government calls @entity7 a big *success* for the country 's travel and tourism industries
one million tourists from abroad visited @entity2 during the event
economist doubts long - term positive economic impact of the @entity7
