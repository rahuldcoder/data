-- can an innocent @entity2 present plunge a normal family into consensual madness ? yes , it can , especially if the catalyst is a three - foot @entity7 , the first exceedingly popular toy that my daughter , @entity9 , ever asked for insistently			1
her obsession meant i ended up in some remote @entity13 ( in another state ! ) one christmas eve about ten years ago , vying with other desperately doting dads for the last few items on well - looted shelves			1
but i managed to bag my first @entity18			1
the next morning , @entity9 exuberantly unwrapped the @entity7 , immediately and inexplicably christening the doll @entity20			1
why that oddly specific appellation , with its country - western triple cadence , we 'll never know			1
it was @entity2 , and it was her doll , and it stuck			1
@entity9 and @entity20 became instant bffs			1
@entity9 lent @entity20 her clothes , they played school , hosted tea parties , went to the park , sat on the stoop together , reenacted scenes from @entity35 movies			1
but then came the inevitable cooling off			2
and they abruptly and blithely cast them into oblivion			2
we put @entity20 in the basement , in a spare room we use as a catchall storage space			2
@entity0 : how to stretch your dollars this @entity2 in the beginning , we 'd each move her around just to scare one another			1
but then she seemed to move around on her own			2
she 'd appear in various rooms without anyone having touched her -- or at least without anyone admitting to having touched her			2
i 'd go downstairs to attend to a blown fuse and there 'd be @entity20 in the boiler room			2
we 'd find her in the pantry with her arms outstretched in a sort of pious @entity63 gesture of supplication or in the bathroom with one leg raised high over her head like a @entity70 dancer			2
coming upon her this way could be frightening			2
she had taken on the stricken phantasmal look of a ghost from a shipwreck			2
she also started terrifying other people			0
i could always tell by the ashen face of some poor plumber or cable guy that he had accidentally stumbled upon @entity20 in a dark corner of the house			1
so we decided to get rid of her			0
but very bad things happened to us whenever we tried to throw her out			0
@entity0 : get organized and tame the holiday madness within hours of the first time i left her out on the street for the garbage men , my wife , @entity88 , who 'd never had a single related symptom , had a severe gallstone attack and needed to be rushed to the emergency room			0
i reluctantly brought @entity20 back inside			0
a couple of months later , i was hit by a car as i crossed a street in @entity98 , @entity99			0
at the moment of impact , i did not have that common experience of seeing my life passing before my eyes ; i had the unmistakable feeling that @entity20 was angry			0
i called @entity88 and asked if anything unusual had occurred in the days preceding my accident			0
she admitted that she 'd taken @entity108 to the @entity109			0
get her back , i said			0
we tried finding a new home for her			0
a friend -- a single guy without kids -- finally agreed to take her in			0
within two weeks , he 'd developed a pilonidal cyst and his brother in @entity116 was arrested for embezzlement			0
our friend returned her and asked that we never again discuss her in his presence			0
we eventually had to reach an accommodation with @entity20 and accept her as a permanent member of our family			1
she is now the unrivaled centerpiece of our @entity2 tradition			1
on christmas eve we keep her in a special " secret detention room			1
" ( we worry that @entity130 , because of his facility for seeing into the souls of all things , might discern in @entity20 something irredeemably bad , and be frightened off before he has a chance to deliver our presents			0
) but on christmas morning , there she stands , in her honored place of precedence , next to the tree			0
@entity0 : how to start a new holiday tradition yes , i suppose you could say she 's an evil zombie doll who led our family to madness			1
but , damn it , she 's our evil zombie doll			1
and we 're never , ever going to abandon her			1
and so , another @entity2 will come and go , under the vigilant , unflinching gaze of our gracious lady of @entity151 , our @entity20			1
