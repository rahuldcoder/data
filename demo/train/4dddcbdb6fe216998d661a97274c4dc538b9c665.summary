@entity0 -- in the latest twist of a widening anti-corruption campaign , @entity4 authorities have detained a popular and controversial television anchor with the national broadcaster , state media reported			1
@entity10 's anchor chair was left empty for friday night 's newscast on @entity12 after prosecutors detained the star journalist shortly before airtime			1
it appeared that @entity17 , known for his " big get " interviews as well as nationalistic sentiment , was taken into custody less than an hour before the start of " @entity23 , " which his co-anchor presented alone			1
speculation about @entity17 's troubles began last month when his longtime patron @entity27 , the head of state - run @entity12 's financial news channel , was detained for allegedly accepting bribes			1
several other senior figures at the channel were also implicated , the government said			0
' face of @entity35 ' @entity17 , 37 , denied through an assistant last month that he was under investigation			1
he tweeted at the time to his 10 million followers on @entity39 -- @entity35 's equivalent of @entity41 -- a philosophical conversation between two ancient @entity44 masters that implied time would eventually clear his name			1
state media cited cctv sources on saturday as saying that @entity50 's detention was closely linked to @entity27 's case , as well as an investigation into his own possible profiting from using cctv resources			1
@entity17 , who 's known for wearing designer suits and driving fast cars , commands more social media followers than any other @entity12 personality and has been called the " face of the @entity35 " by his admirers			1
his official @entity12 bio says he has interviewed hundreds of business and political leaders around the world			0
the @entity65 has profiled him and even the popular @entity67 comedy program " @entity68 with @entity69 " has featured him in an episode			0
fluent in @entity71 , @entity17 began his broadcast career at @entity12 's international service , but his stardom soared under @entity27 after the young journalist jumped to the network 's financial news channel in 2008			1
an unapologetic self - promoter , he has authored two popular autobiographical books touting his friendship with the world 's rich and powerful			2
controversial figure @entity17 became a more divisive public figure as his celebrity grew			1
he successfully led a controversial campaign to kick @entity86 out of @entity0 's @entity87 in 2007 , calling the @entity67 coffee shop 's presence in the historic palace museum an encroachment on @entity4 culture			2
he grabbed a global spotlight in 2010 when @entity67 president @entity94 said he would give the final question at a news conference in @entity97 to @entity99 media			0
" i 'm actually @entity4 , but i think i get to represent the entire @entity102 , " @entity17 said before asking a long - winded question on how @entity94 might prevent his policies from being misinterpreted			2
at an economic forum in northeastern @entity35 the following year , @entity17 asked @entity104 , then the @entity67 ambassador to @entity35 , a question that some critics called a nationalistic publicity stunt			1
others applauded it as a sign of an increasingly confident @entity35 standing up to the @entity67			2
" my colleagues told me you flew economy class from @entity0 to @entity114 , " @entity17 asked @entity104			2
" was that a reminder that the @entity67 still owes @entity35 money ? " @entity104 replied that it was standard government policy for @entity67 diplomats and other officials to fly coach			2
' @entity122 and flies ' @entity50 's reported detention came on the heels of the downfall of several former high - ranking officials , including a retired top general of the 2 million - strong @entity129			2
gen. @entity132 , a former vice chairman of the @entity133 that runs the world 's largest standing army , was expelled from the ruling @entity136 and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes , state - run @entity131 news agency reported early this month			1
@entity132 was also a member of the @entity139 , @entity35 's decision - making body , before retiring in 2012			1
state media have characterized @entity132 as a big " military tiger " caught in the massive anti-graft campaign launched by president @entity144 , who is also the commander in chief			2
@entity144 banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year - end gifts -- and vowed to target " tigers and flies " alike in his fight against corruption			0
he resolved to spare no one , regardless of position			0
@entity12 recently touted the capture of 35 " tigers " since @entity144 took power less than two years ago			0
@entity157 some @entity35 watchers have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials and @entity157 , the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be under investigation for some time			2
@entity27 , the @entity12 executive who was @entity17 's patron , has long been considered belonging to the @entity157 faction			1
state media have reported official probes into many of @entity157 's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus , state oil industry and southwestern @entity175 province -- three places @entity157 once ruled			0
if he is actually charged , @entity157 would become the highest - ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the @entity180			0
some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013 , while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases , according to the @entity136 's disciplinary commission			0
state media have cited the trial and conviction last year of former high - flying politician @entity188 -- which @entity188 supporters called politically motivated -- as one prime example of @entity144 's determination to clean up the party			0
@entity195 aides ousted from @entity136 ' endemic corruption ' longtime @entity35 observers , however , point to the limits of @entity144 's war on corruption			1
" corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going to do it , " said @entity202 , a @entity203 - based commentator and columnist on @entity4 politics			0
" something has to be done about the system			0
" " there have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets			0
there has been no indication that they are going to do that			0
in fact , a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison , " @entity202 said			0
" i think people will be much more convinced of the seriousness of this anti-corruption campaign if there were a move to enact such a law			1
" top @entity4 general expelled from @entity136 for corruption crackdown on more than 1,000 ' naked officials ' in @entity234			0
