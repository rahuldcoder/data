@entity0 is an online foodie			2
she posts pictures of @entity4 grilled chicken and other recipes on the @entity6 , peppering her conversations , like many young women her age , with emojis and lols			1
then there 's the photo of the @entity14 next to the @entity15 that she posted online , calling for @entity18 prime minister @entity17 's head on a spike			2
welcome to the online world of the women of @entity22			1
@entity0 , as she identifies herself online , is one of scores of women that have joined the terror group that has declared an independent @entity28 state across huge swathes of @entity30 and @entity31 in recent months			1
the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) estimates that as many as 15 % of @entity22 ' foreign recruits are women -- possibly up to 200 women from at least 14 different countries			1
it 's not the first time for women in a jihadist conflict			1
but it is the first time they have been recruited in such large numbers			2
" the classic ' mujahadiyah ' is in a supportive role -- as a wife , mother , doing the house tasks for her jihadi male , " says @entity43 of @entity32			2
" they have same goals and ambitions as the men once they get there			2
now granted , their roles may be much more limited to a 1950 's housewife role			0
" that has been the experience of @entity59 , once a shy @entity61 schoolgirl , now married to an @entity22 fighter in @entity31			1
she left her family in november 2013 and headed to @entity31 with nothing more than her university backpack			1
she is believed to write a blog under the name @entity69 that reads as a how - to manual for any female @entity22 recruit			1
top tips : before you travel , get your shots , pack sturdy boots and a warm coat			0
but also , pack plenty of hijabs and niqabs -- full body veils -- because they are not readily available in the self - declared caliphate			0
" the @entity31 ( sic ) view of @entity85 is a complete joke , " she writes in the blog			1
" the abayas are skin tight and their niqaab starts from their forehead and ends at their nostrils			0
" but her ambitions to take on a frontline role appear to have been thwarted by @entity22 ' strict rules for women			1
" i will be straight up and blunt with you all , there is absolutely nothing for sisters to participate in @entity101 , " she writes , using the @entity104 word for fighting or killing			0
" we have plenty brothers ( sic ) who do n't even get selected on operations			0
the brothers get upset and start crying since they want to participate			0
so , what does that make you think ? for the sisters its completely impossible for the now			0
@entity114 in the future ( sic )			0
" in february , however , @entity22 formed @entity116 , a female battalion with about 60 members , all of them believed to between under the age of 25			1
they now have their own media channel with propaganda videos promoting their work			0
the battalion has two roles : manning checkpoints and inspecting all women that pass , and enforcing @entity22 ' strict morality code for women in the caliphate			1
there are reports of the women conducting inspections of schools and markets , and flogging women who are not fully veiled in the niqab			2
" we are seeing two notable trends that we need to pay attention to : one is women actively participating , or rather being right behind , the front lines			2
second , their statements that they want to participate even more , " says @entity145			0
" this is obviously rapidly changing as we speak			0
they 're being trained in weaponry , how to clean the weapon , how to fire the weapon			0
and granted these are just basic bootcamp skills , but they have the means to defend themselves			0
" despites the seemingly trivial exchange of recipes and designs , there is little doubt that these women are staunch advocates of the values and beliefs of @entity22 and regularly call on other " sisters " from around the world to make the " hijrah , " or journey , to @entity31 .			1

experts say women have *flocked* to join @entity22 , which has *seized* swathes of @entity30 and @entity31
one group estimates that up to 15 % of @entity22 ' foreign recruits are women
in february @entity22 formed @entity116 , a female battalion with about 60 members , all under the age of 25
