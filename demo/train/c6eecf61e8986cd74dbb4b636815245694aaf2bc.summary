@entity0 -- @entity2 sought tuesday to portray itself as a stabilizing force fully capable of handling the anger and unrest that have divided the nation less than a week after overthrowing the first democratically elected president			2
" destruction of public property or the stability of the state will not be tolerated , " the military said in an audio statement broadcast on state television			2
" a constitutional declaration has been issued and the road to transition is clear , so people should feel secure			1
" the announcement came a day after 51 people were killed in clashes between the @entity22 and the military over the ouster of former president @entity25 and as the fledgling new government announced it had filled key roles			1
@entity28 , a liberal economist who was finance minister and deputy prime minister , will serve as the interim prime minister ; @entity32 , the @entity33 - winning diplomat , will serve as interim vice president , it said			2
cabinet posts also will be offered to the @entity22 's political wing , the @entity35 , as well as to the @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 's official news agency , reported			1
@entity32 : @entity25 's ouster was needed so @entity38 can not ' fail ' the military 's projection of confidence contrasted with the mood that surrounded a demonstration outside the @entity47 in @entity0 , where thousands of people packed a square , some of them waving the country 's red , white and black flag and others holding aloft pictures of @entity25			0
the @entity22 's highest official of religious law said tuesday he does not recognize the authority of the nation 's interim president and will not negotiate until @entity25 regains power			1
what is the @entity22 ? after that happens , " we will have a national and comprehensive reconciliation in which all the problems can be discussed over a negotiation table but through a prior constitution , " grand mufti @entity64 told the @entity66 news agency			1
he said he recognized neither last week 's military coup nor any of the moves by those who have seized power			0
" therefore , there is no need to speak about any decrees , because they were issued by people without authority			0
" @entity64 was referring to interim president @entity83 , who had issued a constitutional declaration giving himself limited power to make laws and outlined a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections , according to state media			1
@entity83 : interim president , veteran judge , mystery man there was no official word on the decree from the president 's office			1
if the state media reports are accurate , the 33 - article decree would grant @entity83 limited legislative powers after consultation with a cabinet , which would wield veto power			1
the decree also would lay out a timeline for voting on an amended constitution and for holding parliamentary and president ballots			1
the declaration calls for a constitutional referendum in november , followed by parliamentary elections in december and a presidential poll in february			1
without confirmation from the president 's office , it is impossible to say whether the reports -- carried by state - run @entity119 and @entity37 -- are accurate			0
also on tuesday , funerals were held for the victims of clashes between the @entity22 and security forces on monday -- the deadliest day in @entity0 since the revolution that forced then - president @entity125 from office in 2011			1
the interim @entity38 government announced tuesday that it would investigate the violence			2
the @entity129 has refused to describe as a coup the military 's ouster of @entity25 , who was reportedly being held under arrest at the @entity136 headquarters			0
doing so would require the @entity137 to suspend its $ 1.3 billion in annual military aid to @entity38			0
when is a coup not a coup ? it is in the interest of the @entity137 and the @entity38 people " in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination , " @entity129 spokesman @entity141 said tuesday			0
but he added that @entity137 officials were " cautiously encouraged " that the interim government 's plan " includes a return to democratically elected government that includes presidential and parliamentary elections			1
" in response to a question , @entity159 spokeswoman @entity158 told reporters that , " broadly speaking , " the administration still believes that continuing military aid is a @entity137 national security priority			0
but sen. @entity166 , @entity167 , has called for a suspension of military aid to @entity38			0
some financial heavyweights in the region have offered financial assistance of their own			2
@entity175 's finance minister said the kingdom has pledged $ 5 billion in grants and loans to the interim government , according to the official @entity175 news agency @entity180 , and the @entity181 will give $ 1 billion to @entity38 and lend it another $ 2 billion as an interest - free central bank deposit , state news agency @entity183 reported tuesday			2
