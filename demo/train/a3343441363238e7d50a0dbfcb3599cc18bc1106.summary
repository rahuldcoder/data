she has a picture of an @entity4 beheading on her @entity6 profile page , and tweets support for the terror group from @entity9			1
but what worries researchers the most about this woman they call " @entity13 " or " @entity14 " is that only a few months ago , she was tweeting from @entity15			1
@entity16 , a senior analyst with the @entity18 counterterror research group @entity17 , has been tracking her movements through @entity9 with every tweet			1
" i do n't think she knew that she was broadcasting , " @entity16 said , while looking at a map of @entity9 with markers at every location where @entity14 has tweeted			1
" what we 're starting to see is -- with some particular types of cellphones -- they tend to broadcast , or be set up to default broadcast , more than others			0
" likely unbeknownst to @entity14 , her 100 or so tweets since november have each been geo - tagged , allowing @entity35 to see her tweets : first , in @entity15 , then ar @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
what strikes @entity16 is @entity14 's access to the front lines of battles between @entity4 and other militant groups in @entity9			1
he points to a tweet she posted from just outside @entity38 in december , right in the middle of a battleground between @entity4 and the @entity50			2
" why is a female right in the center of these two groups battling it out ? " @entity16 said			0
" this is something we 've never seen in a female profile before			0
for @entity4 to give her permission to be on those front lines , it would have to come from a high - up source			2
" @entity16 tracks @entity14 along with about 20 other @entity18 in @entity9 who are suspected to have ties to @entity4			1
but to him , @entity14 is the most fascinating because he believes she is a woman			2
" the fact that she 's in these forward positions suggests that @entity4 is trying to change up their strategy , or that they 're under stress in terms of some of their recent losses , " @entity16 said			0
indeed , @entity14 claims to be treated with respect by @entity4			1
while outside @entity38 , @entity14 tweeted in december : " quote me : they treated me as a sister and i have seen no kindness like theirs			0
" but , could @entity14 's tweets cause her trouble in @entity18 ? @entity80 , professor of conflict management at the @entity82 , said she believes proposed @entity18 legislation would allow law enforcement in the future to not only stop people who have publicly shown support for terror groups to travel abroad to fight for them , but would also give cause to arrest someone for simply voicing support for a terror group			1
" it will be -- when this legislation passes -- a criminal act to support terrorism , " @entity80 said			0
" so , that is criminalizing speech rather than behavior			0
that one , i bet , will be tested in the courts			0
" the question for @entity35 and other researchers is : what is @entity14 's plan in @entity9 ? the choice between encouraging authorities to take down her @entity6 feed for fear of radicalizing others is complicated by the need for her to keep tweeting so authorities and researchers can gather more intelligence on her and @entity4			1
despite @entity16 ' best efforts to track @entity118 , her @entity6 account no longer exists as of last week			0
@entity6 would not comment on whether the account was taken down by the user or by @entity6 .			0
