@entity0 -- a seismic researcher told @entity1 sunday that he warned the owner of the earthquake - damaged @entity5 nuclear power plant two years ago that the facility could be vulnerable to a tsunami			1
the owner , @entity10 , appeared to ignore the warning , said seismologist @entity12			1
@entity10 has not responded to @entity12 's allegation			2
@entity12 heads @entity15 's @entity14			2
he said he told members of a @entity10 safety committee two years ago that data collected from layers of earth show that in the year 869 a massive tsunami devastated where the plant now is			1
the six - unit @entity5 plant is located about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0			2
without adequate safety measures , a repeat of the first millennium disaster at the site of a nuclear power plant could be far worse , @entity12 said he told the committee then			1
he said he raised the issue because no one else did			2
" i found that odd so i really wanted to speak out and let people know about it , " @entity12 said			2
" no one reacted in any way			2
" instead , committee members discussed a 1938 earthquake in the region that killed only one person			0
@entity12 said that is understandable because there was far more data available about that event			0
however , the power company should have considered the 869 tsunami , he said			0
@entity10 representatives have held frequent press conferences since the march 11 earthquake triggered @entity15 's nuclear crisis			1
however , critics say direct questions rarely get direct answers from the company			0
that includes @entity57 's allegation			0
one critic is the @entity15 government , which on sunday pressed @entity10 for better information about the @entity5 plant as it battled against criticism of its own handling of the crisis there			1
@entity67 , the government 's point man for the crisis , issued what he called " stronger instructions " to the @entity10 to fully disclose as much as possible about conditions at the plant			1
" every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly " to @entity15 's @entity75 , @entity67 , the chief cabinet secretary , told reporters			0
" without this communication , it 's very difficult for the government to ( establish ) proper safety measures			1
" workers have spent more than two weeks trying to stave off potential meltdowns in three reactors at the plant			0
@entity67 said @entity10 needs to be up - front with the @entity15 people -- millions of whom get power from the company , and millions more have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis			1
@entity10 is @entity15 's largest utility			0
both the company and the @entity15 government have been criticized for failing to provide more detailed information about the situation at @entity5 , one of three nuclear plants the company owns in northern @entity15			1
a poll by @entity15 's @entity100 found the government is getting poor marks for its handling of the crisis , with 58 % telling pollsters that they disapprove			1
though 57 % of @entity15 approve of how the government has moved to provide relief for victims of the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , the poll found , only 39 % approve of how it has managed the situation at @entity5			1
@entity67 said the government has done " everything possible			1
" " but we also realize that many of the people in the affected areas have been very inconvenienced , and they are in a very serious crisis , " he added			1
" we understand that , and there may be more such difficulties ahead			0
" @entity67 said prime minister @entity121 has been talking with local leaders " one by one " to find out what they need			0
he declined to share details of those conversations , telling reporters , " we are simply focusing on providing better assistance for the residents			0
" @entity130 , the director - general of the @entity131 , returned to his native @entity15 shortly after the crisis erupted to press @entity121 for more information			2
" in the beginning , we had some difficulty , " @entity130 told @entity1 sunday			0
" but i went to @entity0 and i talked to prime minister @entity121 and i asked him to facilitate the flow of information			0
" @entity121 " promised me the highest level of transparency , and the flow improved , " he said			0
the government has ordered residents within a 20 - kilometer ( 13 - mile ) radius to evacuate and those living from 20 to 30 kilometers to stay indoors			2
but levels of radioactivity above the levels considered safe for infants have turned up in drinking water as far south as @entity0 , and the anti-nuclear environmental group @entity151 said sunday that it had found high radiation levels in @entity153 , a town of 7,000 about 40 kilometers northwest the plant			1
@entity155 , a radiation monitor for @entity151 , said radiation levels ranged between .008 to 0.01 millisieverts per hour , or more than 50 times normal readings			1
though that 's a dose far below the levels that would cause radiation sickness , it presents " a serious risk for developing cancer in the longer term , " he told @entity1			1
" people living there -- and there are still people living there -- would exceed the maximum annual permitted dose in just a couple of days , " @entity155 said			0
he said the town 's mayor is seeking " practical , correct information " from the @entity15 government			2
" without the right information , you can not take the needed precautionary measures to protect yourself from radiation , " he said			2
" we think that , to the population , is really important			0
" @entity183 , a @entity121 spokesman , said the government understands the nuclear crisis has become " an issue of global attention			1
" traces of radioactive iodine have been detected in @entity194 's @entity193 province , the @entity196 state of @entity197 and as far away as @entity198 , authorities there announced over the weekend			0
none of those readings have been strong enough to harm public health -- and the @entity196 , @entity202 and @entity203 have put restrictions on imports of food products from some regions of @entity15			0
@entity1 's @entity208 in @entity0 and @entity209 in @entity210 contributed to this report			0
