@entity0 -- who is @entity3 , leader of the most secretive country in the world , rooting for in this year 's @entity6 ? @entity7 , of course			1
that translates to " mythical horse			0
" and it 's the nickname of the @entity13 team			1
the team is as mysterious as the @entity16 country it represents			1
it practices in secret and it remains sequestered from other teams in @entity21 before games			0
if @entity3 refuses to play political ball with the rest of the world , should the rest of the world allow @entity13 to play soccer in the @entity6 ? popular belief dictates that a rogue nation like @entity13 should be punished and isolated			1
but @entity13 is crazy about soccer , its top sport and a source of national pride			1
banning the country 's team when it is eligible for the world 's most popular championship series would bring global shame			1
the @entity42 government says : " @entity43			0
" " this is a tournament where countries have national teams and they compete for the right to play			0
and @entity13 has survived the , you know , the qualifying competition , " said @entity48 , the @entity49 spokesman			2
@entity52 , the soccer 's governing body , does not like to mix politics and sport , said @entity56 , a senior fellow at the @entity57			2
" as far as i 'm aware , they have never suspended a national team because of the policies or human rights record of the national government , but rather because of political interference by that government in the selection [ or ] running of the team , " @entity56 said			0
he said @entity21 was banned during the apartheid era because the national team was not integrated			0
" to make an example of one team would immediately raise questions about another and they just do n't want to go down that road , " he said			0
cutting broadcasts of the games could be another option , but @entity78 's state - run tv stations would probably step in to help @entity13 get a television signal , @entity73 said			1
and a more subtle and potentially effective way to shame the country 's leadership is to allow the team to play and let the @entity13 people watch , giving @entity13 -- and billions of viewers worldwide -- a first - hand glimpse of condemnation of their country			1
" no one likes to see innocent players be punished for the sins of their government , " @entity56 said			0
" neither is it desirable for the poor citizens of @entity13 to be denied one of the few pleasures they have in watching their national team			1
however the @entity6 is a huge global stage to embarrass and shame the @entity13 regime for its recent actions			1
" last year , @entity103 players wore green -- the color of the opposition movement -- wrist bands in a @entity6 qualifying game to show support for anti-government protesters			2
" this [ wristbands protests ] would be difficult for censors to hide from those able to watch , particularly the elites with access to tv and international media , " @entity56 said			0
even in the world of soccer , where fans know endless details about individual players , virtually nobody knows any of the @entity13 squad			1
but @entity7 has three players attracting attention , according to a team report by @entity1 's sister publication @entity128			2
forward @entity130 , good enough to play in @entity131 when not playing for his home team , is considered the man to watch			2
striker @entity134 , and midfielder @entity135 , are the " glue " of the team			0
and the man who would get the least envy if the team does not fare well ? manager @entity141			0
the @entity13 entered the competition as the lowest qualifier , and expectations are low			2
but the team is well known for its surprise performance in 1966			0
the @entity147 had ended and @entity148 was raging while the @entity42 and the @entity149 were racing to space and trying to outdo each other in the nuclear arms race			0
@entity13 was already an isolated state run by the @entity153 - sung , though it was hardly the security threat it is considered to be today			1
that year , @entity13 went further than anybody had expected			2
they even surprised dominant @entity157 , beating them to make it to the quarter final			0
today the country is so secretive that virtually nobody , including @entity42 intelligence agencies , really knows what goes on inside its borders			0
that includes how its soccer team will do			0
even the team 's jersey is hard to find in stores because nobody really has the rights to make and sell them , according to news reports			1
so why the hype around @entity7 ? the team provides a rare window into its country			2
not many people see @entity13 on a day - to - day basis			1
when the team takes to the field it will be the first chance for many people to see @entity13 up close and personal			1
@entity7 's chances of winning might be as mythical as the horse of their name			0
but the one thing @entity13 has managed to do -- both on and off the field -- is surprise the world			1
and this @entity6 may be no exception .			2

@entity13 team is as mysterious as the @entity16 country
some believe rogue nations should be barred from world sport
team 's play in @entity6 casts *spotlight* on hard - line leadership
