" @entity10 's conviction has raised questions about her possible extradition to @entity1 to serve her 28Â½ - year sentence , handed down in absentia , since she has been in the @entity52 throughout the retrial			1

" if the @entity148 upholds the murder conviction , he expects to see @entity1 authorities make an extradition request to the @entity52 so that @entity10 serves her sentence in @entity1 , he said			1
@entity112 said that she had been told of a letter written by @entity10 to the @entity112 family but that she had not seen it			2
she also appeared to rule out meeting with @entity10 in the future , despite the @entity52 's overtures to the family and whatever the final outcome of the case			1

" a lot has happened over this length of time			0
