-- even as they trade barbs publicly -- and even as artillery shells and accusations continue to fly in @entity5 -- the @entity6 and @entity7 could take solace friday in at least one respect : they are still talking			1
discussions between the two in @entity13 -- centered around @entity15 's proposal to have @entity5 president @entity17 's government hand over its chemical weapons stockpile -- were supposed to end friday			1
they continued through the night and were extended into saturday for a reason , @entity6 officials said			0
" if there was no opening , we would n't still be here , " a senior @entity22 official said			0
an @entity26 administration official said separately that " we are coming closer to agreement on the scope of @entity5 's chemical weapons stockpile			1
" and even before the @entity13 talks ' extension was announced , @entity6 secretary of state @entity30 and @entity7 foreign minister @entity31 signaled their intent to meet again : on september 24 in @entity35 on the sidelines of the @entity37			1
the prospect of yet another round of negotiations in the next few weeks pointed to a potentially bigger endgame for the @entity6 and @entity7 in the hastily arranged meeting they began on thursday in the @entity45 city			2
that 's not to say all of the many outstanding issues -- on @entity5 's chemical weapons and much more -- have been resolved			1
senior @entity6 administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified the main sticking point was what consequences @entity17 and his government should face			0
these officials have no expectations @entity7 would agree to any @entity37 resolution that included authorization for possible military force against @entity5			1
the @entity6 , therefore , will not insist it be included			0
that runs counter to @entity26 's call for the international community to take action , including a potential military strike , for what the @entity6 and allies call a chemical weapons attack by @entity17 's forces last month outside @entity5 's capital that they say killed more than 1,400 people			1
@entity26 has threatened to act alone , if necessary , and his administration credits that threat with @entity7 's surprise proposal last week to have @entity5 turn over its chemical weapons arsenal to international control			1
outside of the @entity78 , however , administration officials insisted they would not take the military threat off the table			0
a senior defense official said there has been " no change " in the military 's planning or readiness levels and commanders have not been instructed to change their " posture " in any way			0
chemical weapons report expected monday the @entity78 -- and especially its @entity91 , including permanent members the @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 -- could play a key role in the international community 's response to @entity5			1
and a report by its inspectors looking into an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity102 could be pivotal in guiding where countries come down on the issue			2
@entity37 secretary - general @entity107 is expected to present the report to the @entity91 at 11 a.m. monday , three diplomatic sources said			0
@entity107 said friday that he believes it " will be an overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used			2
" the big questions are by whom and , if that 's settled , what the world should do about it			0
@entity118 and other @entity5 officials have vehemently denied their forces were responsible , despite assertions by @entity26 and others to the contrary			0
@entity7 has stood by its longtime ally @entity5 , challenging the validity of the @entity6 claims			1
at the same time , and as the threat of @entity6 - led strikes loomed , @entity15 raised its proposal on @entity5 's chemical weapons stockpiles and working through the @entity37 -- this after , time and again , blocking @entity37 action involving @entity5			1
@entity118 quickly agreed , leading to the talks between @entity30 and @entity31 in @entity13 that began thursday			2
@entity5 also told the @entity78 on thursday that it has sent the paperwork for joining the @entity135 , which bans such armaments			0
the @entity5 submission was being reviewed by @entity37 lawyers			2
if deemed sufficient , secretary - general ban ki - moon would register it and @entity5 would officially be a member state in the convention			0
@entity37 envoy : @entity6 - @entity7 talks ' extremely important ' at first , the @entity13 talks were about @entity7 's proposal monday for @entity5 to give up control of its chemical weapons , which the @entity6 had demanded in order for @entity26 to drop plans to launch military strikes			1
@entity5 crisis : keeping up with key developments now the stakes have gotten higher , with @entity30 telling reporters that progress in the broader peace process will largely depend on whether the current @entity13 negotiations on @entity5 's chemical weapons succeed			1
a communique from last year 's @entity5 peace talks attended by all parties called for a ceasefire and establishing a fully inclusive transitional government to write a new constitution			2
that went nowhere , however			0
in fact , the @entity37 estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in 2011 , in addition to more than 2 million becoming refugees and over 4 million being displaced within @entity5			2
@entity170 , the joint @entity37 - @entity171 envoy on @entity5 , expressed fresh hopes friday that a peaceful , political solution to end the war could be reached			1
@entity30 and @entity31 's talks were a big reason for his optimism , with @entity170 calling them " extremely important " -- not regarding chemical weapons , but for the peace process generally			1
' a criminal act ' to keep up pressure on @entity17 , @entity26 on friday described last month 's chemical weapons attack a " criminal " act			1
@entity107 weighed in as well , saying the @entity5 leader " has committed many crimes against humanity , and therefore i am sure there will be surely a process of accountability when everything is over			0
" @entity6 officials say the mere existence of talks with @entity7 on the matter is progress , noting that such a prospect would not have been considered just a week ago due to @entity15 's repeated efforts to block @entity37 action against @entity5			1
@entity5 civil war : 5 things to pay attention to today speaking to reporters friday after he and @entity31 met with @entity170 , @entity30 called the talks about @entity5 's chemical weapons " constructive			1
" " we are working hard to find common ground to be able to make that happen			0
and we discussed some of the homework that we both need to do , " @entity30 said			0
@entity31 said @entity7 had promoted a peaceful solution to @entity5 's civil war , adding that the communique agreed to in last year 's first round of peace talks involving all the parties had been " basically abandoned			1
" on chemical weapons , @entity31 said international officials had to work together " to design a road which would make sure that this issue is resolved quickly , professionally , as soon as practical			1
" opinion : is diplomacy the harder solution in @entity5 ? getting chemical weapons fraught with challenges even if all parties agree , weapons experts say the already major challenge of putting @entity5 's chemical stockpile under international control would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , amid an active civil war			1
@entity5 this week acknowledged that it possesses chemical weapons and wants to join the global convention that bans them			2
@entity0 's @entity235 reports that the convention would become legally binding on @entity5 30 days after it formally joins , meaning @entity17 's government would have to permit inspections at that time			0
after another 30 days -- which would be 60 days from when it formally joined the convention -- @entity5 would have to declare its chemical weapons stockpiles			2
on thursday , @entity17 noted that joining the convention would give @entity5 the standard 30 days from compliance to declare its stockpiles , but @entity30 responded by expressing concern about that long a time period , saying " we believe there is nothing standard about this process			2
" at the @entity22 on friday , spokeswoman @entity248 said that " verifying , accounting for securing and destroying a large stockpile of chemical weapons takes time , " adding that " it 's very difficult to do , particularly in an active war zone			2
" " if we keep forward momentum , if we believe there 's a credible and verifiable plan on the table to do just that , we 'll keep moving forward with that process , because resolving this issue diplomatically is certainly preferable to resolving it or to dealing with it with military action , " @entity248 said			0
in @entity263 , @entity6 soldiers guard against @entity5 missile threat political hurdles @entity26 had tried to put together a @entity267 coalition to attack @entity5 , but the @entity95 @entity268 voted against taking part , denying him a normally reliable ally			0
other allies said they wanted @entity37 authorization in the form of a @entity91 resolution before they would join a coalition			0
the president then asked @entity277 to authorize a military response in @entity5 but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the @entity7 proposal monday provided a diplomatic opening			0
in a speech to the nation tuesday night , @entity26 made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on @entity5 , challenging @entity277 and the @entity6 public to look at video footage of victims of the chemical attack			2
@entity7 president @entity291 responded with an op - ed posted wednesday night on the @entity294 ' website , saying " there is every reason to believe " @entity5 troops were n't responsible , while challenging @entity295 and the idea of " @entity6 exceptionalism			1
" his remarks provoked a strong reaction in the @entity6 , with some @entity6 politicians deeming them insulting and sickening			0
but rather than step back , @entity291 spokesman @entity304 fired back by claiming @entity295 was " unaccustomed ( to ) competition " in global matters and has " grown too used to patting everyone on the back patronizingly			0
" other questions loom in @entity295			0
one has to do with the @entity5 opposition , some of whom are already receiving @entity6 - funded weapons and ammunition , according to a @entity6 official			1
yet there 's some questions about the mix of moderates and @entity321 extremists among the rebels , including some who are affiliated with @entity324			0
then there 's the issue of @entity5 's chemical weapons themselves , and whether it 's possible to track all of them down			1
some @entity6 intelligence analysts believe it 's known where most of @entity5 's stockpile is stored , according to two @entity6 officials familiar with internal discussions			1
but others say the @entity6 might not be able to verify the location of up to 50 % of them			0
7 - year - old 's story shows pain , worry of @entity5 refugees @entity0 's @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 and @entity355 contributed to this report .			0
