after more than a decade on the sidelines of the international community , @entity0 has emerged from a long and troubled history to become one of @entity6 's newest republics			1
sitting at the crossroads of central and southern @entity6 -- and often seen as a geographical region that straddles both eastern and western @entity6 -- @entity0 has been at the center of some of @entity6 's bloodiest conflicts			1
invaded by the @entity13 @entity12 in 1459 , one of the catalysts for @entity16 in 1914 and , most recently , the diminishing hub of a rump @entity19 as the former communist nation tore itself apart in a bitter civil war , @entity0 only emerged as an independent republic in 2006 after a referendum in @entity24 that ended the last vestige of the @entity19 federation			1
with the secession of @entity24 , @entity0 lost its coast and remains one of nine landlocked countries in @entity6			1
its population is now a little over 7 million people			1
end of the union the end of the @entity35 and @entity24 was the last move in the bitter dissolution of the six republics that once formed the @entity39 that also included @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
formed in 1945 under strongman @entity44 , the authoritarian @entity41 - born dictator forced an uneasy alliance amid the ethnically diverse @entity48 states by keeping strong , central control over the army and police			0
when he died in 1980 , the @entity39 continued until the early 1990s but began to fall apart under the leadership of @entity54 nationalist leader @entity53			0
@entity40 and @entity43 were the first to secede and left the @entity19 federation with relatively little bloodshed			1
( the 10 - day war in 1991 with @entity40 was a low - intensity conflict that claimed the lives of 19 @entity40 and 44 members of the @entity19 forces			1
) conflict escalates however , conflicts in neighboring @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity66 between 1991 and 1999 , all states with sizable @entity54 minorities , were more intense , leaving upwards of 140,000 people dead and millions displaced			1
@entity69 led military campaigns to unite ethnic @entity71 into the long - held nationalist idea of a @entity0			2
neighboring states , meanwhile , fought to create new nation states outside the @entity19 federation			2
in 1998 , violence erupted in the autonomous province of @entity66 in @entity0 when the ethnic @entity77 rebelled against @entity54 rule			2
amid mounting pressure on @entity53 , @entity80 forces unleashed airstrikes on @entity66 and @entity0 in 1999			2
the conflict created a crisis in the region as ethnic @entity86 sought refuge in neighboring countries			2
when @entity54 forces were eventually driven out , the @entity89 administered the region			0
@entity89 talks on the future of the province broke down in 2007 , and @entity66 declared independence in 2008 despite @entity54 opposition			0
@entity66 remains only partially recognized within the @entity97			0
economic realities since the dark days of the @entity19 conflict , @entity0 has sought to find equilibrium for an economy that was subject to years of mismanagement under the @entity104 regime , suffered infrastructure damage during @entity80 bombings in 1999 and endured extended economic sanctions during the @entity19 conflict			1
despite embracing market reforms after the fall of @entity53 in 2000 , many of the country 's largest enterprises ( including its gas , telecommunications and power utilities ) remain in state hands , and high unemployment and stagnant household incomes remain persistent political and economic problems			2
levels of youth unemployment in 2012 were at a record 51.1 % , according to the @entity123 , ranking it seventh in the world and only marginally better than @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity42			0
while the most recent jobless figures show an overall fall to over 20 % , a historic high of 25 % in 2012 ranked the country only slightly better than @entity132 and @entity133 in terms of joblessness			0
@entity6 reintegration after years of isolation during the @entity19 conflict , @entity0 has begun reintegrating into the international community			1
it rejoined the @entity139 and the @entity140 as it emerged from the heavily state - controlled economy under @entity53			0
while high levels of corruption , an inefficient judicial system and an aging population remain challenges to @entity0 's progress , it has the advantage of a skilled labor force , a strategic location at the center of @entity6 and free trade agreements with the @entity97 , @entity153 and @entity12 as well as member states in the @entity155			1
despite a @entity157 government under current president @entity158 , @entity0 has historically been a strong ally of @entity153 , which supported the state during its opposition to @entity66 independence			0
@entity153 not only signed a major energy deal with @entity0 in 2008 , but ties were further strengthened in 2009 when @entity153 provided it with a 1 billion - euro ( $ 1.4 billion in 2009 ) loan to help it overcome a sharp downturn triggered by the global financial crisis			0
@entity158 's stated aim is to develop ties with both the @entity97 and its traditional ally @entity153			0
while it is a candidate to join the @entity97 , it is widely considered that it will not be ready for accession until 2020 .			0
