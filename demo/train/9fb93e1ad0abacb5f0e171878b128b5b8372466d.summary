@entity1 senior international correspondent @entity0 just returned from the border town of @entity3 , @entity4 , where troops are searching for terrorists among the flood of smugglers and illegal workers trying to sneak into the country from @entity11			1
@entity11 is home to @entity13 and @entity4 officials are concerned the recent takeover of the capitol by @entity17 rebels will give the terrorist group a greater foothold			1
@entity4 dilemma : how to spot potential terrorist amid tide of human misery @entity0 discussed the situation and his experiences covering global conflicts during his 25 - year career in a wide - ranging " ask me anything " chat on @entity31			1
here are the highlights from the hourlong conversation			1
some of the posts have been edited for grammar and clarity			1
@entity37 : " i hope you do n't mind answering a really basic question			2
what exactly is the situation today and can you explain it with a bit of historical context for naive readers like me ? thanks ! " asked milkmilk_lemonade			2
@entity0 : " historically , decades back , the border between @entity4 and @entity11 was very open -- little more than a line on the map			1
if you go back before that , there was not even a line on the map			2
more recently , about 6 years ago , @entity17 tribesmen crossed in @entity4 took control of a village			2
there was a three - week battle with helicopter gunships before @entity4 got it back			2
as @entity11 has become more unstable , its economy has gotten worse			1
clearly , @entity4 is the richer country with more oil , so the border is division between the haves and the have - nots on @entity11 side			1
so many come to @entity4 for work , even an 11 - year - old boy i met who earns $ 100 a month working on a till at a small supermarket			2
it 's the only way for some @entity11 to make money , so they cross over for stays that last weeks or months			1
the huge numbers crossing make it hard to control and know who is who -- terrorist or poor guy			2
" q : " is there anything from the border you want to share , that was n't included in the story ? can you talk about the process and problems of trying to gain permission for it ? " asked sirpoopsal0t			1
@entity0 : " there were so many more people than we could get in our tv reporting			1
i wrote a story for @entity104 after i did the tv piece to cram in more details , but i was shocked			2
i did n't quite know what to expect that day , but it was way more people and drugs than i 'd realized			2
we try to get everything in our reports , but we saw group after group being caught , particularly at dusk			2
" q : " how was my country 's border patrol / army ? were they as you expected ? worse maybe ? " asked sai911			1
@entity0 : " they were professionals			1
i was struck by the quality of the officers and the access we were given			2
i was only there for a day , but they have a huge job on their hands			0
" q : " what have you found to be the biggest three obstacles in locating terrorists ? " asked @entity136			0
@entity0 : " they can usually be found through intermediaries , but sometimes it 's more dangerous than others			1
" @entity37 : " @entity141			0
it takes [ nerve ] to do what you 're doing ! why are you doing it ? what made it happen ? " @entity0 : " it 's important that the world hears what 's happening in its darkest corners			1
it 's important for the people in those dark places to know that people care , that they are people too and that their lives count			0
" q : " when traveling in dangerous countries does the fear ever leave ? do you get an opportunity to meet people and enjoy their way of life ? " @entity0 : " yes , on the good days we do get time to meet folks			1
at the end of the day on the border we had half an hour to spare and the border guards took us to the beach and gave us dinner -- fish , lamb ,			1
. salads , humus , bread -- right there on a rug at the beach			0
we got to relax a little before we ran off to catch the plane			0
sometimes after an interview , we can chill out a little with folks in their homes			0
those can be interesting conversations			0
" we always have mind to dangers of any location			0
" @entity37 : " you always hear about post-traumatic stress disorder with soldiers			0
do you find yourself experiencing it given your work ? " asked allianceofmagicians			0
@entity0 : " sure , @entity197 does hit journalists too			1
soldiers tend to face the exposure to those kind of traumatic events for much longer and often more intensely than we do			0
we have access to help here at @entity1 and i 've talked to our expert over the years			1
" i 've never felt that i 've suffered from @entity197 , but i 'd say i do get awfully sad sometimes after a bad story -- tears , etc. -- but it passes			0
i have a great home life , i love to run and cycle			0
that kind of stuff gets you out of yourself , but i 'd say my exposure to trauma has not been that excessive			0
" @entity37 : " @entity1 keeps reminding us at home that they are n't going to show any of the photos of the captured @entity219 pilot			1
during and after the @entity221 massacre they kept letting us how they were n't going to show any of the offending cartoons			0
with all you 've seen what are your thoughts on news organizations making those kinds of decisions ? " asked @entity224			0
@entity0 : " in this day and age all these things can be found online someplace			1
at least that 's my experience			0
i have seen the video of the pilot , and i feel horrible			0
" the @entity236 posed an interesting question about what sort of people do we want to be			0
the power is in our hands			0
do we want to inflame or do we seek a more just , equitable world where we respect and tolerate each other			0
