@entity0 -- controversial remarks by the pastor of a @entity5 church stole the spotlight from several @entity9 @entity8 contenders friday during the first day of the @entity10 , an annual gathering of evangelicals and other social conservatives			2
after introducing @entity15 gov. @entity14 , @entity16 , pastor of the @entity17 of @entity5 , told reporters that @entity9 should n't vote for @entity8 hopeful @entity19 because he 's a @entity20 and described the @entity21 as a " cult			1
" speaking live on @entity1 's " @entity23 , " @entity16 told @entity1 political correspondent @entity24 , " i think @entity19 's a good , moral man , but i think those of us who are born - again followers of @entity28 should always prefer a competent @entity29 to a competent non-christian like @entity19			1
so that 's why i 'm enthusiastic about @entity14			1
" in the same exchange , @entity16 told @entity24 that the @entity35 " has officially labeled @entity33 as a cult			1
" in fact , a website maintained by the @entity35 lists the @entity20 faith under its " @entity42 and @entity43 " section , which also includes @entity40 and the @entity41			2
contacted by @entity1 , the @entity19 campaign had no comment on @entity16 ' remarks			1
@entity47 , a spokesman for @entity21 , declined to comment on a statement " made at a political event			2
" " but those who want to understand the centrality of @entity28 to our faith can learn more about us and what we believe by going to mormon.org , " @entity47 said in a statement			0
the @entity14 campaign told @entity1 via email that it did not ask @entity16 to introduce the @entity15 governor at friday 's event			1
asked personally about @entity16 ' remarks after a campaign event in @entity64 friday night , @entity14 told reporters that he did not think @entity33 is a cult , a view @entity14 spokesman @entity60 had expressed earlier on @entity14 's behalf			1
speaking friday evening on @entity1 's " @entity73 , @entity74 , " @entity69 , president of the @entity70 and an organizer of the two - day event , said the @entity14 campaign was informed two weeks ago about event organizers ' plan to have @entity16 introduce @entity14 and the @entity78 camp , in @entity69 ' words , " signed off on " that plan			1
@entity69 also told @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity73 that event organizers did not know what @entity16 was going to say in introducing @entity14 nor did the @entity15 governor 's campaign			1
@entity84 on " @entity73 , @entity74 , " @entity16 told @entity73 that @entity14 did not know in advance what he was going to say and the @entity5 pastor noted that he did not " refer to @entity33 as a cult " in his actual remarks introducing @entity14 at the event			1
then , @entity16 affirmed his earlier comments about the tenets of the @entity21			1
" this is not an unusual view , @entity95 , that @entity33 is not @entity96 , " @entity16 told @entity73 , " @entity96 has never embraced @entity33 as a part of its faith			2
" @entity16 added that , in his estimation , because @entity19 is mormon " he does n't embrace the historical tenets of evangelical @entity96			1
" then @entity16 told @entity73 that , religion aside , he still did not think @entity19 was the right choice			1
" there are plenty more reasons not to vote for @entity19			1
and i think conservatives have plenty of reasons , leaving @entity33 out of it , not to be energized by @entity19 's candidacy , " the pastor said			1
@entity16 ' comments largely overshadowed the remarks of @entity14 , @entity112 , rep. @entity113 , former house speaker @entity114 , and former sen. @entity115 , all of whom addressed the conservative gathering friday			1
@entity14 focused his speech less on social conservative values and more on the economy , taking a swipe at president @entity123 along the way			2
" [ @entity74 ] are n't looking for soaring speeches			2
they 're looking for common sense solutions , " @entity14 said friday			1
" they know our first order of business to get @entity74 working again is sending our current president to the private sector			0
" the @entity15 governor primarily talked about @entity74 ' exceptionalism , ' arguing the best way to maintain freedom is to protect the country 's economic and national security			2
and on the heels of an agreement this week between the @entity8 and @entity142 @entity141 on a 5.6 % " millionaire 's tax , " @entity14 blasted the idea of raising taxes as a way to stimulate the economy			1
" when [ liberals ] utter phrases like ' fair share ' you just know they 're once again playing fast and furious with the truth , " @entity14 said			2
" and the truth is you ca n't rev up the engine of an economic growth by heaping higher taxes on job creators			2
" @entity14 did delve into his stance on abortion			2
notably , he said he was a consistent anti-abortion advocate unlike other @entity8 hopefuls			0
" for some candidates , pro-life is an election - year slogan to follow the prevailing political winds , " @entity14 said in apparent hit against his opponent , @entity19 , whom he did n't name			1
@entity112 , who recently joined @entity14 and @entity19 in the top tier of the @entity9 race according to several recent national polls , relished his new status			1
@entity112 told the gathering of social conservatives the rest of the @entity9 field is afraid , " that this long shot may not be a long shot any longer			0
" the former ceo of @entity180 who has never held elected office also dedicated a good portion of speech to foreign policy , a policy area perceived as a weakness on @entity112 's part by some @entity9			0
taking aim at @entity112 's ' 9 - 9 - 9 ' tax plan , @entity115 introduced what he called his ' 0 - 0 - 0 ' plan : " zero corporate income tax on any manufacturer processor in this country ... zero corporate tax on all of that money brought back if invested in plant and equipment in this country ... and zero -- we will zero out and repeal every single regulation the @entity123 administration has put in place that is 100 million dollars in business or more , " @entity115 said			0
@entity115 said his plan would boost the middle class and manufacturing , an area of the economy that the former @entity211 lawmaker said used to be strong			0
" twenty - one percent of the people working in this country when i was growing up were involved in manufacturing , " @entity115 said			0
" now it 's 9			0
we need to get those jobs back			0
" former house speaker @entity114 , long known as one of the @entity9 's top ideas men , used his address to deliver a broadside against the notion of judicial supremacy and particular against more liberal judges on the federal bench			0
@entity113 , a vocal social conservative , shared how her faith played a role in her fight against abortion rights			0
she added that she introduced legislation in @entity232 on thursday that would require women considering an abortion to hear and see the heartbeat of the fetus before making a decision			0
a longtime favorite of the tea party movement , @entity113 also sounded what is becoming a recurring refrain in her campaign for the @entity8 ; she told fellow conservatives that they should not settle for a moderate @entity9 as they make their decision about who to back in 2012			0
" do n't listen to these people , who every four years , tell you we have to select a moderate from our party and we have to settle for the sake of winning , " she said			0
" i am here to tell you we are going to win			0
this year , we do n't settle			0
" @entity69 opened the event by telling social conservatives that electing a @entity9 in 2012 would not be enough			0
" this election is too important to elect a @entity9 , " said @entity69			0
" we need to elect a conservative that will undo the economic and moral and social destruction this administration has unleashed on @entity74			0
we do n't need politicians that promise to slow down decline			0
we need leaders that are bold and courageous that will undo destructive policies			0
" along with rep. @entity269 , former @entity268 gov. @entity19 is set to address the gathering saturday			2
it is not known whether @entity19 will speak directly to @entity16 ' remarks about @entity33			1
this is n't the first time the @entity5 pastor has hit @entity19 over his religion			1
during the 2008 campaign , he made similar comments .			0
