editor 's note : @entity2 , a nationally syndicated columnist and @entity4 - based radio host , is the author of " listening to the @entity5 " and " speak , @entity6 ! a @entity8 's view of @entity9			1
" please visit his web site			2
@entity2 says the @entity12 statements downplaying role of community organizers are a mistake			1
( @entity16 ) -- the @entity12 have made it clear where their focus is this week with their convention slogan , " @entity20			1
" with the abundance of flags , chants of " @entity9 , @entity9 " and tributes to those in the military , they have been laying it on thick			2
sen. @entity28 has often talked about the need for @entity9 to dedicate themselves to service , namely military , and he is on the money			2
but a line of attack that was used consistently last night by former @entity36 mayor @entity35 , and later by @entity38 gov. @entity37 , tried to call into question whether community organizers put their country first			1
@entity37 focused on the issue , mainly to criticize the @entity44 campaign for offering up his community organizing work opposite her experience as mayor			1
but when you examine @entity35 's dismissive tone -- and the subsequent laughter by the @entity12 in the @entity52 -- regarding the community organizer jabs , the @entity48 could have an opening			1
after praising @entity37 's speech , i said as much , and that they can expect the @entity44 - @entity59 camp to seize on that point			1
this morning , i read an e-mail from @entity44 campaign manager @entity62 , who incorporated the community organizer argument into a fundraising appeal			1
@entity12 operatives i talked to said the lines were brilliant and that community organizers do n't play to the @entity12 's strength			1
and so do the many folks who have sent me angry e-mails			2
they include white republicans , black @entity48 , people from @entity72 , @entity9 , and @entity73 , @entity9			1
at a time when @entity9 are losing their homes to foreclosure , folks are trying to get by after layoffs , people are struggling with lack of healthcare , and we 're facing pressing environmental issues , it 's ludicrous to slam the little man and woman who is n't asking the government for handouts , but is doing what they can to make their neighborhood and city better			1
i think of my parents			2
as a child growing up in the @entity94 neighborhood in @entity95 , @entity96 , my parents were just regular folks trying to raise their five children ( sounds like gov. @entity37 )			2
they were always present at our local elementary school ( sounds like gov. @entity37 ) and were heavily involved in our church			2
but our neighborhood was dying			0
older homeowners were dying and their children did n't want to live there , so they began renting to people who really did n't care			0
we saw abandoned homes , weeded lots , no sidewalks , a park falling into disrepair , and a senior citizen center shuttered			0
so they joined several others neighbors and decided to form a civic club			0
others called them crazy for trying to advance their ideas , but they did n't give up			0
they enlisted their children in passing out flyers and putting up signs , notifying folks of the monthly meetings			0
a few folks showed up , but they kept going			0
after months , and then years , we began to see progress : stepped up police patrols and crack houses raided by the @entity95 police , @entity130 and @entity131			0
more heavy trash pickup days			0
bottom line , these average , low - to middle - income people did n't have political power			0
they focused on people power			0
they organized a community to take action			1
ireport.com : is @entity37 really ready to start an experience debate ? so when @entity35 and @entity37 mock community organizers , they do n't just toss a barb at sen. @entity44 , they demean @entity152 and @entity153			1
they degrade the women who fought for their rights			2
they disrespect the labor activists and immigrant worker activists like @entity159			2
they dismiss those in the civil rights movement -- folks from small town @entity9 who were sick and tired of being sick and tired			1
they thumb their noses at the @entity165 of the world who want a better life for their children			0
it would have been perfectly fine for @entity35 and @entity37 to say that @entity44 's community organizing days did n't amount to enough experience to be president			1
but when you openly laugh and mock those hard - working @entity9 who are in the trenches every day , then you really do n't care about " @entity20 " or service			0
will this be a major deal or a ripple ? likely the latter			0
but the one thing i know about community organizers is that they know how to organize communities			1
and if the @entity20 wants to win , they best not slap those folks they need for voter registration drives and systems to get folks to the polls			0
community organizers are always told they ca n't do something or are dismissed as meaningless			1
yet they often have the last laugh			0
@entity35 , @entity37 and @entity28 might want to remember that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : republicans are *emphasizing* the theme of " country first "
@entity2 : *wednesday* night 's speeches took jabs at community organizers
yet civil rights activists and other organizers have accomplished a lot , he says
@entity2 : @entity12 should *beware* of *deriding* organizers who can get out the vote
