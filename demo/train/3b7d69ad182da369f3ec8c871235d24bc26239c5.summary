@entity0 , @entity1 -- the elderly parents of @entity5 's accused kidnapper testified wednesday that he was a troubled boy who grew increasingly self - absorbed as a man			1
" @entity9 's a very intelligent person and used that to its full extent in the harassment of the other children and my wife , " said @entity7 , the defendant 's father			1
the elderly witness made his way through the courtroom with a walker , apologizing for being some 30 minutes late because his taxi driver dropped him off outside the wrong courthouse			0
the testimony wednesday painted a picture of a troubled family history , and a @entity25 who alienated his parents as a boy and shunned his own children as an adult			1
@entity7 faces a federal kidnapping charge for abducting @entity31 in 2002 and holding her for nine months			1
@entity31 , now 23 , testified earlier in the week that @entity7 told her she was divinely selected to be his wife , kept her tethered to trees in a mountain camp , and raped her repeatedly during the ordeal			1
he could face life in prison if convicted			1
in his opening statement , defense attorney @entity40 described his client 's life as mirroring his father 's in many ways , including unusual and fervent religious beliefs , but he noted that @entity7 was never formally diagnosed with a mental illness			1
during his testimony wednesday , the elder @entity7 said his son had been troubled since " in the womb , " and was conceived under " unfortunate psychological circumstances for me and my wife			1
" he was asked whether he had a special connection to his son			0
" i did n't have too much connection , maybe that 's the trouble , " he replied			2
" he sort of alienated himself , isolated himself , in his own little world , you know			0
he was n't very responsive to me			0
" the father also testified about a time when @entity9 was 9 or 10 , when his father dropped him off in a city park in an effort to teach him a lesson			2
" i said , ' now you 're going to find your way home , and see how it is to be on your own			0
' " his son was gone until nightfall , he said			0
he 'd made money taking photographs for @entity71 tourists , and used his earnings to go to a double feature at the movies			0
" this is typical of @entity9			0
he 's smart ; ' i 'm going to make them worry about me , i 'll just stay away all day , ' and he did , " his father testified			1
@entity77 , the defendant 's mother , testified only briefly wednesday afternoon			2
she struggled with many questions , saying she 's in the process of losing her memory			2
" i remember my son as a little boy , " she said , " and what he is now is not the same person			0
" she said his behavior toward her became so frightening that she obtained a protective order			0
during cross examination , she was asked to read from a letter from her son during the time his appearance changed			0
" my hair and beard are part of a new act			0
sorry i ca n't be a sweet - looking boy all the time , " the letter reads			0
a sister of @entity7 's , @entity99 , testified that her brother appeared to blame his own children for his lack of accomplishment , and told her they were undeserving of his love			1
@entity7 eventually put the children from his first marriage , @entity107 and @entity108 , up for adoption , while preventing his own family members from adopting or having contact with them , according to testimony wednesday			1
@entity99 said she 'd been encouraged for a time when her brother became active in the @entity115 and appeared to live a healthier lifestyle than he had before			0
while married to @entity117 , however , he once again began to isolate himself from the family and became increasingly narcissistic			2
" once he started doing his wanderings with @entity117 , especially , he became very distant , " she said			2
" he would kind of be looking down on other people			0
he felt that he had a special connection with @entity123			0
" prosecutors have held that @entity7 is not sincere in his professed religious beliefs , and is a masterful manipulator			1
defense attorneys so far have called 10 witnesses over two days , including @entity7 's parents , two of his sisters and several friends			1
they hope to show that @entity7 was so mentally ill when he snatched the @entity0 teen that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong			1
their case could include testimony by @entity7 himself , as well as his wife , @entity117 , who is serving up to 15 years in prison as part of a plea deal with prosecutors that hinges on her willingness to testify against @entity7			1
@entity117 was not called to the stand in the government 's case , but appears on the defense 's witness list .			2
