monday 's @entity1 poll results just plain surprised , almost shocked me			1
when i saw the poll was due to be released , i expected the @entity4 to be taking a beating considering the terms president @entity7 and his staff have been using to describe them over the past 10 days ( " extremists , " " people with a bomb strapped to their chest " ) and the unfair , derogatory press coverage of their position			1
the results are so dramatically better for @entity17 and worse for the @entity18 and @entity7 than i expected that i was curious to see just how much better republicans are faring during the shutdown of 2013 ( and how much worse the president and the @entity18 are faring ) than in comparable polls of the 1995 - 96 shutdowns			1
what i discovered was revealing and runs against the entire media narrative of this year 's struggle over the continuing resolution and the debt ceiling			0
let 's start with the shutdowns during the @entity33 administration when i was leading @entity34 republicans			1
there were two : one in november 1995 and one in december ' 95 and early january 1996			0
a @entity1 poll at the time showed @entity39 blamed republicans over president @entity33 for the first shutdown by almost 2 - to - 1 , 49 % to 26 %			1
republicans fared only a little better in the second shutdown of the mid- ' 90s			0
a @entity1 poll after it began showed the @entity39 people preferred @entity33 's approach to that of the @entity17 by 52 % to 38 %			1
sixty - two percent said they had negative feelings about the @entity4 leaders during that conflict , compared with only 49 % about @entity33			1
this is not to say the shutdowns were a strategic mistake			0
quite the opposite : the enormous progress we made afterward -- four consecutive balanced budgets , welfare reform , the first tax cut in 16 years -- was a direct result of republicans standing firm in 1995 and early 1996			0
it proved to @entity33 , and more importantly to the country , that we were serious about the ideas we had run on in 1994			0
as a consequence , we were the first re-elected @entity4 majority in the @entity34 since 1928			2
in the long run , in other words , the shutdowns did n't do us any damage , a fact gallup documented recently			0
but as the above poll numbers suggest , most @entity39 were clearly frustrated during those shutdowns , and in the immediate term they blamed @entity4			1
in retrospect i brought some of this on us because i was very firm and clear beforehand that we were prepared to close the government if that was what it took to get an agreement to balance the federal budget			0
in a sense , @entity39 were right to blame ( or credit ) us with the shutdowns because we were in fact on offense , seeking a decisive change in government			2
as the first @entity34 @entity4 majority in 40 years , we were feeling empowered , and we probably showed it too clearly			2
there was another big reason why the public gave @entity33 the benefit of the doubt , however			0
he was consistently willing to talk and to meet			0
people saw him as a reasonable guy trying to help get to a solution			0
and since @entity4 controlled both the @entity34 and the @entity105 , the congressional @entity18 were not a big part of the public drama			1
because we were so openly pushing for a big change and @entity33 was so willing to be reasonable , the @entity39 people naturally attributed the shutdowns to us and gave @entity33 good marks for at least trying to negotiate			1
today the situation is radically different			0
virtually every @entity4 has learned from 1995 - 1996			2
@entity4 ' consistent refrain is that they do n't want to shut the government			2
they constantly say that they want to negotiate , to make a deal , and that they 're frustrated by @entity7 's refusal to talk			1
the president , on the other hand , has taken the hard - line position that he will not negotiate , repeating this on television practically every day			2
in addition , he has used his office to cause as much pain to the people as he reasonably can , including very public and unnecessary pain for our soldiers , veterans and small business owners			0
this behavior strikes most @entity39 as offensive and unfair			0
i thought , however , that with the general bias of the press coverage -- the overemphasis on @entity4 dissent , the almost complete avoidance of covering democrats who have split with their leaders to vote in favor of clean , piecemeal continuing resolutions to fund parts of the government , and the normal process of giving @entity7 a permanent benefit of the doubt -- that monday 's poll results would have been better than 1995 - 96 but still clearly anti-republican			1
the results were vastly better for the @entity17 and worse for @entity7 than i expected			2
when asked in the @entity1 poll whom they are angry at , 63 % said @entity4 , 58 % said @entity18 and 53 % said @entity7			1
that is a 10 - point margin for the president and only a 5 - point margin for @entity18 , compared with a 23 - point margin in november 1995			1
independents said they blamed all three equally ( 60 % @entity4 , 59 % @entity18 , 58 % @entity7 )			1
this is so clearly within the margin of error that it is for all practical purposes a tie			0
after weeks of the media focusing blame on house speaker @entity170 , sen. @entity171 and the @entity17 , it is clear the @entity39 people are not buying it			2
there have been too many days of the president saying , " i will not negotiate			0
" the country believes him			0
they can see he 's a big part of the reason the government is shut down			0
if @entity34 @entity4 continue to pass targeted , clean continuing resolutions to fund parts of the government and @entity105 @entity4 demand day after day for the right to vote on these popular measures , the margin of blame may begin shifting from virtual parity to a solidly @entity18 problem			1
if the @entity17 repeat every day their willingness to negotiate and @entity7 and @entity105 majority leader @entity192 repeat every day their refusal to negotiate , this may become catastrophic for the @entity18 .			1

@entity195 : in shutdowns of 1990s , @entity4 was blamed much more than @entity18
he says a new @entity1 poll shows that most people also blame @entity18 this time
@entity202 says president @entity7 's refusal to negotiate is hurting his image
he says @entity4 strategy is winning
