@entity0 -- picture the scene : dozens of computer hackers poring over their keyboards in a room filled with powerful computers , feverishly typing in code most of us could never comprehend			1
their mission ? to " break in " to virtual servers in a simulated world			0
yet these particular hackers are not breaking the law , they are actually reinforcing it			2
they are taking part in a six - month program organized by the @entity21 government to train some of the brightest code - breaking minds to become the nation 's first line of defense in the war against cyber crime			1
according to the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , the " @entity34 " program is designed to train computer experts to defend against domestic and foreign cyber attacks			1
@entity21 , which is one of the most @entity37 - connected nations in the world , is frequently subject to cyber attacks , especially from its northern neighbor , with whom it is still technically at war			1
in 2009 , a number of government websites , including the presidential @entity45 and @entity46 , crashed for days after being targeted with malicious code			2
and in 2011 , a bank 's entire computer system was hacked and shut down			2
the attack left tens of thousands of computers infected and some permanently damaged , according to the country 's prosecutors			0
the @entity0 government pointed the finger at @entity58 , citing similarities in code used in earlier cyber attacks by @entity21 nationals in collaboration with hackers believed to be connected with a @entity66 intelligence agency , @entity21 's prosecutor 's office said in a press release			1
the @entity66 government has yet to comment on the claims			2
the official value of the loss from the attacks is unknown , but the @entity73 estimates the financial loss from the 2009 attacks alone at between $ 33.7 million and $ 50.5 million			2
attacks from domestic and foreign sources are on the increase , authorities say			0
cyber attacks rose by 37 % from 2008 to 2011 , according to @entity81			1
" cyber attacks in general are getting more and more complicated			1
it is also known that @entity66 is training highly skilled hackers , " @entity84 from @entity21 's @entity85 told @entity1			1
" but what if they , for instance , hack into our nuclear power systems ? we need a stronger defense system			0
" according to @entity94 , the chief consultant for the " @entity34 " program , a cyber attack from the @entity66 is like fighting an asymmetric war			1
it is very difficult to counter attack			0
" the @entity21 internet industry developed very fast			2
it is essential to train cyber security experts in all fields including those who will be working for commercial companies , " said @entity94 , a prominent name in the @entity21 hackers community			1
sixty computer experts , from high school students to college students , were selected for the program			1
most participants were already well known in the country and some are award - winning hackers from local and foreign hacker competitions			0
@entity116 , 17 , is one of the survivors of the first phase of candidates on the program			0
he focuses his work on printer networking systems , an area easily exposed by cyber attacks			1
" companies may print confidential documents using network printers			0
if the security was breached , companies potentially could be eavesdropped , " he said			0
the program , which is now down to 20 hackers , will only graduate one expert from six fields in its final stage			0
aside from receiving 20,000,000 krw ( $ 18,500 ) as a prize , each graduate will then be recommended to companies or government agencies they wish to work for in the future			0
the six fields include digital forensic , security consulting , vulnerability analysis , mobile phone security , converged security and cloud - computing security .			0

" @entity34 " program designed to train computer experts to defend against cyber attacks
@entity0 has *accused* @entity66 of being behind many of these cyber attacks
