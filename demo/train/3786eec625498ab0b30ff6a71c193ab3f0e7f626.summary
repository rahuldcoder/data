the younger man then shot himself , authorities said			2
" this is such a crystal - clear example of the problem , " said @entity19 , executive director of the @entity2 - based @entity20			1
" if sen. @entity15 were n't a public figure , we would n't be talking about this			2
the fact of the matter is that individuals and families and communities suffer every single day everywhere in this country because there are not sufficient acute facilities for people			1
" deeds remained hospitalized wednesday , but his condition was upgraded to good , authorities said			2
deputies called to @entity15 ' home day before fatal fight the stabbing came one day after the son was taken to a local hospital under an emergency custody order			2
police confirmed that @entity48 was brought in by the local sheriff for evaluation by mental health professionals			2
the @entity52 reported tuesday that @entity37 received that evaluation , but he was released because no psychiatric bed could be found in the area			2

officials at @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity64 hospitals told @entity55 on wednesday beds were available , but they had not been contacted by medical personnel who evaluated the younger @entity15			1
the hospitals are within an hour or two from @entity68 , where the incident occurred , but it was unclear whether those who had the initial contact with @entity37 reached out only to hospitals closer to @entity68			2
in the wake of the stabbing , @entity2 gov. @entity74 ordered a review of state and area mental health services , according to his spokesman			1

in 1960 , by comparison there were 535,000 public psychiatric beds nationwide			1
@entity19 said a person with severe mental illness now is more likely to end up in jail or a state prison than a psychiatric hospital			1
" this is a population with no voice , " @entity19 of the advocacy center told @entity55			0
" the people who are sick enough to be committed to a hospital for care are not people who are voting , and they are not people who are a political constituency			2
they 're not a political priority			0
" a 90 - day audit by the @entity2 's inspector general in 2012 termed the practice of releasing the mentally ill because of bed shortages " streeting			1

the clock starts when authorities deliver the patient for clinical evaluation			0
physicians make a recommendation to the court after the evaluation			0
if a magistrate approves , medical staff search for an available hospital bed			0
" in certain conditions , a two - hour extension is granted by a magistrate , but under no circumstances can a person be held beyond six hours involuntarily , " @entity143 said in a statement			0
after 32 people were killed in the 2007 @entity196 shooting , @entity2 lawmakers sought to overhaul the emergency - evaluation processes and increase funding for community mental - health services			1

" what you do n't have is sustainable funding , " said @entity203 , executive director of the alliance			0
" a tragedy happens , the legislature reacts			0
you see this in other states then , over time , that 's chopped away and these services are n't available			0
" @entity19 said the shortage of psychiatric beds dates back half a century to president @entity218 's signing of the @entity219 in 1963			1
the goal was to shut down public psychiatric hospitals , replacing them with small community - based centers			1
" it was a perfectly reasonable idea , except the community facilities were never built , " she said			0
" the hospitals were closed , and the people who once got hospital treatment for the most part no longer do , and the beds are n't there , period			1
" institutionalized -- in prisons " we have an estimated 450,000 people with mental illness in jails and prisons today , " @entity19 said			2
" you sort of add up that we have 43,000 in beds and 450,000 in jails and prisons , and you 're almost back to the hospital bed number we had in 1960 -- except we 've just reinstitutionalized them			1
and , of course , if @entity37 had not killed himself , he would be today in jail			0
there was n't a hospital bed for him , but we would have found a cell for him			0
" at a forum on mental illness in @entity255 last month , @entity252 secretary @entity251 recounted the recent experiences of two people close to her dealing with mental health issues			2
the forum marked the 50th anniversary of @entity218 signing the community mental health act			0

" i 'm the secretary of @entity252			0
i know who to call			0
i know where the resources are			0
so if our friends and family had difficulty , i had a real snapshot into what people in communities deal with every day			1
