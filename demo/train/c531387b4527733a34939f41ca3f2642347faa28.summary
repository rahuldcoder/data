-- @entity1 has faced many difficult opponents in the ring -- but nothing quite like this			1
the former heavyweight world champion has teamed up with colorful @entity8 businessman and philanthropist @entity7 to help @entity11 refugees in @entity12			1
@entity7 , once the lead singer of @entity14 , shot to fame briefly in 1963 with the single " @entity16			1
" he went on to become a music producer before turning his focus to international aid and diplomacy			0
the @entity21 estimates about 5,000 @entity11 have asked for asylum in @entity12			1
about 1,200 mostly @entity11 live cramped inside containers and tents at the @entity26 camp near @entity12 's border with @entity28			1
on a foggy sunday morning , i accompanied the pair on a drive from the capital , @entity33 , to the camp , about 170 miles away			2
as soon as we arrived , @entity1 and @entity7 were surrounded by hundreds of refugees angry at camp conditions in @entity12			1
the pair planned to deliver food aid and to help resettle some families in a home supplied by @entity7 's charity , @entity42			1
one refugee woman asked : " why do n't you do more to help us ? " @entity7 replied : " since last year i 've delivered 5,000 tons of food to camps			1
i 'm a private individual			0
we now have a hotel and we are bringing families			0
" the woman persisted : " what about the rest of us ? " @entity11 refugees in @entity55 face polio threat @entity1 and @entity7 's recent aid mission was not supposed to be like this			1
in midst of the chaos , @entity7 said to @entity1 : " we ca n't blame them for being angry			1
but they have to understand			0
we are a private foundation			0
" the refugees questioned why more was not being done to help them			0
visibly annoyed , @entity7 said : " wait a minute ! time out ! we got here 15 minutes ago			2
now have a little bit of patience before i lose my patience			0
and we take our food and do n't take anybody ! " that did not appease the refugees			2
instead , they held up their thumbs , chanting " fingerprint " -- their way of demanding to be documented as refugees and then released from the camp			1
" i would n't refuse food if i was hungry			0
if they ca n't handle it , let 's go , " @entity7 said as he got back into the car			1
they managed to sneak two families out and meet them at a nearby gas station			0
@entity7 offered to place them in a converted hotel with other @entity11 refugees for up to a year			1
but @entity7 has more ambitious plans			2
he told us he would be meeting president @entity91 within a few weeks			0
" we know he 's killed some of his own people			0
but then so did @entity94			0
so did @entity96 , " @entity7 explained			2
when asked why he would have more success than others in reaching out to @entity91 , @entity7 said : " i know he loves @entity16			2
i sang it and i 'll sing it to him			0
i 'm going with @entity1 and possibly @entity104 , @entity105			2
@entity106 , @entity91 , is a big boxing fan			0
and we 're not politically involved			0
" it 's dark by the time we reach our next destination -- the hotel that @entity7 is using to rehouse refugees			1
there is already one family inside			0
@entity11 refugees face miserable winter in @entity55 when the new arrivals walk through , tears start to flow as @entity118 recognizes his brother , @entity119			1
he has n't seen him in nearly a year			0
" @entity119 , you know this man ? it 's your brother ! " @entity7 says enthusiastically			1
" your heart skips a beat and i was crying probably as much as he was , " he tells me			0
" i saw @entity1 had a tear in his eye			2
" when i ask @entity1 why this mission is important to him , he says : " because at some point in time , when you leave this earth , they wo n't be asking about how many championships i won			1
they 'll say : ' what did you do for the least of them ? ' i can say i was in @entity12 , i was in @entity139 , i was in the @entity140			2
" @entity7 says he is already looking for another hotel to house more refugees			1
but with so many needing help , they may not be able to reach as many as they hope			0
more than 100 people try slip into @entity12 every day , border police say , most say they are the fleeing the fighting in @entity11			1
they pay smugglers as much as $ 1,500 to guide them in			0
" the amount refugees pay varies according to the number of people trying to cross the border			2
if the group travels only to @entity12 , the price they pay to traffickers is much lower			2
if @entity12 is only a transit point , however , the price can go much higher , " @entity160 , director of the board in @entity163 city explains			2
@entity12 is one of the poorest countries in @entity168			0
and this , @entity12 officials say , is the best they can do			0
the @entity170 says it is trying to get more help for @entity12 from the @entity172			0
the @entity21 says more than 62,000 @entity11 have applied for refugee status across the @entity172			0
" but we can not forget these people have suffered enormously			0
it 's unacceptable that they go on suffering once they reach the @entity172 , " @entity21 high commissioner for refugees @entity175 said recently during a trip to a refugee camp in @entity33			1
@entity12 is now building a wall along the most thickly - forested section of @entity12 's border with @entity28 , in an attempt to keep people out			1
but @entity11 's refugees are desperate			1
and with or without a wall , @entity12 remains the doorway to @entity168			1
@entity11 's refugee children : alone , ' in crisis , ' @entity21 report says			1

@entity1 teams up with @entity8 philanthropist @entity7 to help @entity11 refugees
the pair visited a camp near @entity12 's border with @entity28 to rehouse some families
they met @entity11 refugees demanding to know why more is n't being done to help
@entity12 is building a wall along part of the border with @entity28 , to keep refugees out
