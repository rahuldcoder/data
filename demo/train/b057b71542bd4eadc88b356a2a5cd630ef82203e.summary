@entity0 -- it 's been described as the closest thing to being buried alive -- complete paralysis of the body , except for controlled movement of the eyes			1
@entity9 shortly before a car crash left him " locked - in , " able to think and reason but paralyzed except for his eyes that 's how 24 - year - old @entity9 has spent the last eight years of his life			1
he suffered a brain stem stroke after a car accident when he was 16 , leaving him with " locked - in " syndrome			1
this condition is not the same as other forms of paralysis where you feel nothing in the affected areas			0
@entity9 has 100 percent sensation all over his body			1
an itch can become excruciating with no way to communicate that he needs it scratched			0
he has frequent muscle spasms as well , which can be painful			0
" even sweat rolling down his skin or something , there 's nothing he can do about it , " said @entity31 , 57 , @entity9 's father			1
" so he feels everything in the environment , but there is really just nothing he could do about it			0
" doctors told the @entity42 that their son has no chance of getting better			0
" there 's always hope , but a large portion of it is in the category of miracles , " said @entity31			2
but new research may give @entity9 the miracle he has been waiting for			1
dr. @entity53 , chief scientist at @entity54 , a company he founded to conduct research on the brain and communication			2
he came up with a revolutionary idea that he believed could turn @entity9 's thoughts into speech			1
he invented an electrode that detects the neural signals in the speech motor area of @entity9 's brain			1
in december 2004 , the electrode was implanted , and @entity53 , along with four independent labs , began decoding the signals in @entity9 's brain			1
the researchers asked him to think of specific vowel sounds , then mapped his brain activity			2
by knowing what his brain looked like when he thought each specific sound , scientists could translate the activity into a language that a voice synthesizer could read			1
dr. @entity78 , associate professor of cognitive and neural systems at @entity80 , said his lab , one of three others pursuing neural signal translation , had a breakthrough recently : they were able to hear the sounds @entity9 was trying to say using the decoder they built			1
" that was a very exciting moment , where we knew this process of taking neural signals and driving a synthesizer was going to work , " @entity78 said			1
in the next two months , researchers will hook up the synthesizer			2
@entity9 will produce his first vowel sounds then			1
the next phase is getting him to produce consonants , which are much harder to synthesize			0
conversations , they say , are still about two years away			0
for @entity9 , this will mean expressing himself beyond just one word answers			2
the only way he can indicate what he wants is by moving his eyes up for " yes " and down for " no. " but even this method only goes so far			2
he gets so tired that he can answer only about six questions before he has to stop			0
former @entity111 magazine editor @entity109 suffered from the same syndrome and was also able to communicate using only one eye			0
he wrote about the horror of having locked - in syndrome in his book " @entity116 , " which was made into a film released november 30			1
@entity119 's writing was an exceedingly slow process			2
he dictated the book by blinking his left eye when the correct letter was presented to him			0
he described his mind as a butterfly flying freely inside a diving bell -- a chamber that is placed underwater , trapping the air inside			0
his descriptions of life as a man who is paralyzed and mute gave @entity31 the first detailed account of what it must be for his son to live with locked - in syndrome			1
" he had to blink that book with one eye , " @entity31 said tearfully			0
" had he never done that , no one would ever understand what locked - in means			1
" asked if ever wanted to end his life , @entity9 looked up , his way of saying yes			2
asked if he still felt that way , he looked up again			0
but he has n't lost all hope			0
asked if he believes @entity53 's research will allow him to communicate again , he answered " yes			0
" @entity31 thinks so too			0
" dr. @entity53 said he believes @entity9 will be able to speak again either through a voice synthesizer or through some other means			1
i believe him and i agree with him , " he said			0
it may do the same for tens of thousands of people living with @entity154 's disease , muscular dystrophy or even @entity156 's who have lost their ability to speak			0

scientists working to convert " locked - in " man 's brain signals to speech
electrode captures brain signal , converts it language voice synthesizer can read
@entity9 is able to think , reason , but completely paralyzed except for eyes
only way he can indicate what he wants is to move eyes up for " yes , " down for " no "
