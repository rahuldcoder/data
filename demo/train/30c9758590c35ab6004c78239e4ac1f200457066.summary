@entity0 , @entity1 -- flooding has displaced an additional 1 million people in @entity1 's @entity5 in the past two days , according to new @entity7 estimates released friday			1
" we have more people on the move , to whom we need to provide relief			1
an already colossal disaster is getting worse and requiring an even more colossal response , " said @entity12 , a spokesman for the @entity7 's @entity13			1
@entity12 said rains have forced the evacuation of an estimated 1 million people in southern @entity5 in the past 48 hours or so			1
" the magnitude of this crisis is reaching levels that are even beyond our initial fears , which were already leaning towards what we thought would be the worst			2
the number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising			2
the floods seem determined to outrun our response , " he said			2
the @entity7 also said friday that it is increasingly concerned about flood - driven malnutrition among children			1
" the flooding has surrounded millions of children with contaminated water , " said @entity37 , deputy representative of the @entity38 ( @entity38 ) in @entity1			1
" most have nothing else to drink			2
we fear the deadly synergy of waterborne diseases , including diarrhea , dehydration and malnutrition			1
" acute malnutrition was high in much of @entity1 even before the floods			1
for instance , 27 percent of children under 5 in @entity53 province were malnourished , as were 17 percent of children in @entity56 , according to the @entity7 a hospital in @entity5 is overrun with people suffering from waterborne illness ; two children share each bed and more are on the floor			1
a doctor at the hospital said there are " not enough resources because of huge population ... coming to this hospital			0
" @entity67 , a farmer in @entity5 , escaped the floodwaters with his wife and two children earlier this month			1
but then his 3 - month - old daughter @entity70 got sick			1
" she started to get fever and could n't keep anything down ... lots of belly pain , " said @entity71 , the infant 's mom			0
a few days later , the same symptoms struck the @entity78 ' son , 2 - year - old @entity77			1
both children died on the way to the hospital , with @entity77 weighing just 8 pounds and @entity70 weighing 2 pounds			1
floodwaters have started to recede across @entity1 , but in the @entity85 , the potential for more flooding remained high , especially given high tides in the @entity87 , where the @entity88 spills out			1
already , more than 17 million @entity1 -- from the @entity90 border in the north to the mouth of the @entity88 in the south -- have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago			1
to date , @entity1 's unfolding tragedy has claimed 1,600 lives , according to the @entity97			0
that number is likely to rise as more drowned bodies are discovered in receding waters			0
many refugees have sought shelter at relief camps , where food and drinking water are now available			0
but every day , there are new camp arrivals -- people who were already poor , who now have nothing			2
along the flooded @entity112 in northeastern @entity1 , six local aid workers have spent two weeks braving the torrents on rafts they built from used tire tubes , bamboo and gaffers ' tape after motorized boats failed to arrive			0
the workers are ferrying tents , blankets and other supplies to hundreds of thousands of people stranded across the river and cut off from normal supply routes			2
last year , bombs and bullets from the army 's offensive against the @entity131 destroyed many homes and lives in the region			0
residents had barely begun to recover when the rains came			0
" we are fed up , " said @entity137 , a 65 - year old man who lost his house in the floods			2
" you do n't ask a dead man why he 's in his grave			0
it 's not his choice			0
" @entity145 , another local , said he lost his leg when his house was mistakenly bombed in last year 's fighting			0
the same blast took his wife and son			0
" we are very sad for all that @entity112 has been through , " he said			0
the damage from @entity1 's worst humanitarian catastrophe is sure to hurtle the impoverished nation back in terms of development			0
this week , @entity158 's top aid official saw firsthand the dire needs in @entity1			2
dr. @entity160 , administrator for the @entity161 , said he was deeply moved by his visit to @entity163 and that aid agencies were " scaling up their response efforts as quickly as they possibly can			0
" @entity160 announced the @entity158 would be diverting another $ 50 million for flood relief from the @entity170 - @entity169 , which allocated $ 7.5 billion in nonmilitary assistance to @entity1 over five years			1
@entity2 's @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and journalist @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
