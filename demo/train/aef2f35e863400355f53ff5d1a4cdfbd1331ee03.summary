during the third and final presidential debate last october , president @entity0 made a promise to the @entity4 people			1
@entity6 , a package of forced budget cuts , " is not something i proposed , " he said			1
" it will not happen			1
" what a difference 100 days make			0
the military , fatigued after a decade of war , has already endured three rounds of budget cuts during the president 's first term alone			1
it now finds itself little more than a week away from another $ 500 billion in budget cuts under sequestration , an outcome that would have a profound and lasting impact on the readiness and capabilities of our military for years to come			1
rather than exhibit the leadership required from our commander in chief , the president has been missing in action			1
with just weeks to spare , the president has belatedly come forward with a proposal based on higher tax revenues and cuts in defense and discretionary domestic spending			1
last week 's offer from @entity39 holds fast to the president 's preferred model and proposes a significant tax increase while asking our military to cut tens of billions more			1
despite claims to the contrary , this approach is neither responsible nor balanced and should be deeply troubling to the voters who took @entity0 at his word during the campaign			1
let 's be clear : defense spending is not what 's driving our indefensible national debt			2
we spend less than 18 % of our budget on the military , while mandatory domestic spending accounts for 60 %			1
despite this fact , the president has refused to consider reforms to mandatory spending -- the real driver of our debt crisis -- while using our troops as a piggy bank to keep unsustainable spending programs on life support			1
@entity68 : president ca n't kick his legacy down the road there is a growing concern that the president will not seriously negotiate with @entity75 on a compromise to sequestration until after it takes place on march 1 and each member of @entity75 hears of the pain affecting his or her constituents			1
but the real pain will be felt by the men and women serving our country , who will see arbitrary cuts to the resources they so desperately need			2
they will be asked immediately to do more with less and accept greater risk in a world that is becoming more dangerous by the day			0
this is an unconscionable position and a dereliction of duty			0
secretary of defense @entity93 recently stated , " if sequester happens , it is going to badly damage the readiness of the @entity4			0
we have the most powerful military force on the face of the earth right now			2
it is important in terms of providing stability and peace in the world			0
if sequester goes into effect , and we have to do the kind of cuts that will go right at readiness , right at maintenance , right at training , we are going to weaken the @entity4			2
and make it much more difficult for us to respond to the crises in the world			0
" gen. @entity116 went further in recent testimony before the @entity118 and stated that sequestration would put our military on a path where the " force is so degraded and so unready " that it would be " immoral to use the force			2
" two weeks ago , the @entity124 announced its decision to indefinitely delay the deployment of the @entity128 carrier strike group to the @entity129 , denying our combatant commander in the most volatile region of the world the capabilities he urgently requires			0
the @entity134 estimates that if the cuts go into effect , two - thirds of its aircrews will not receive the training hours needed to stay mission - capable			2
the @entity140 says that an astounding 80 % of its combat brigades will be forced to skip necessary training			2
and nearly a quarter of a million troops could be forced out of the service as the result of layoffs			0
such precarious times should spur meaningful action from the president			0
yet every indication we 've seen , including his lecturing at the @entity156 address , suggests that his @entity157 is more interested in disavowing responsibility and blaming others			0
while the president sits idly by , we have worked tirelessly to spare our military from these devastating cuts			1
the @entity157 voted twice for a proposal sponsored by rep. @entity164 that would replace sequestration with reforms to mandatory spending programs and voted four other times in support of finding a solution to sequestration or forcing the @entity157 to be transparent in how it would implement the cuts			1
members of the @entity39 -- including most recently sens. @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 -- have repeatedly put forth reasonable and common - sense proposals to the same end			0
we have pleaded with the president to , at the very least , accept our proposals as a starting point for a meaningful compromise agreement			0
we have held multiple hearings and passed the @entity185 so that @entity75 , the president , and every @entity4 would fully understand the truly shocking consequences of sequestration			0
though the hour is late , we remain hopeful that this president will set aside political posturing and finally get serious about working with @entity75 to find a lasting solution to sequestration			0
the men and women in uniform deserve nothing less .			0
