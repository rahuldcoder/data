in 1986 , with control of the @entity3 up for grabs , @entity0 dispatched a reporter to @entity5 , an important battleground that year , to survey the race between then - rep. @entity8 and his @entity10 opponent , @entity9			1
" mr. @entity8 's performance in @entity14 could well turn on the @entity16 vote , " the correspondent noted , spotlighting @entity8 's religion			2
" though only some 12 % of @entity18 are @entity19 , they punch more than their weight			0
less than half the state 's eligible voters bother to register , but @entity19 almost always do , which gives them about a quarter of the likely turnout			0
" members of the @entity26 still punch more than their weight in @entity5 politics , holding a broad array of elected offices and deep sway within the business community			0
but the portrait of @entity5 as a sparsely populated desert locale where elections hinge on the @entity16 vote now seems quaint			1
the state 's dramatic population growth over the last two decades -- two - thirds of all registered voters in @entity5 registered to vote after the 2000 presidential election , for instance -- has diluted the influence of @entity16 voters on statewide elections			1
@entity5 had just 375,000 registered voters in 1998 when @entity8 won his first @entity3 race			2
now , more than a million voters are on the books			0
there are nearly 700,000 voters in @entity52 alone			0
at the same time the state 's population was exploding , @entity5 's @entity16 population slipped from 12 % in 1986 to an estimated 7 % today			1
mormon vote ' almost always over-hyped ' although @entity59 is certain to energize @entity16 voters this election season as the first member of his church to helm a major party 's presidential ticket , political watchers here say the @entity66 vote in @entity5 rarely lives up to its billing in the national media			1
" the @entity16 vote here is almost always over-hyped , " said veteran @entity70 columnist @entity69			0
" it 's not going to be a huge factor unless the election here is very , very close , because you have to assume that 90 % to 95 % of them are going to vote for @entity59			2
but it 's still relatively insignificant compared to other demographics , like @entity81			0
" the impact of @entity66 voters is felt mostly inside the @entity10 , a dynamic that came into focus during the @entity10 primary fight , when @entity19 showed up at polling places in robust numbers to help push @entity59 to victories in @entity91 states like @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
in exit polls conducted during the @entity5 caucuses in february , 25 % of the electorate identified as @entity16 , and nearly all of them voted for @entity59			1
a similar story unfolded during the caucuses in 2008 , when @entity59 first ran for president			0
the state does not keep tabs on voter registration by faith , and religious affiliation was not exit - polled during the 2008 or 2010 elections			0
strategists in both parties , though , operate under the assumption that the @entity16 share of the vote drops off sharply in @entity5 's general elections , and that most of their support goes to @entity10 candidates			1
republicans and @entity115 in @entity5 , including members of the church , agree that @entity16 voters can no longer swing a statewide election on their own			1
but @entity10 hope that in a tight election -- as the presidential race is expected to be in @entity5 and the small number of states that will decide the election -- even the slightest uptick in @entity16 turnout with @entity59 on top of the ticket could provide an edge			1
" it 's going to be a close state , so whatever difference you can make up somewhere is going to be very important , " said @entity129 , the @entity10 candidate in @entity5 's @entity130			1
most of @entity5 's mormons live in and around @entity52 , the most populous in the state			2
they are also prevalent in rural communities in the southern part of the state and in the east along the @entity141 border , precincts that usually vote @entity10			0
mormons register and vote at higher rates former @entity5 gov. @entity146 , a @entity10 , said @entity19 tend to register to vote and participate in elections at higher rates than other demographic groups , usually to the @entity10 's benefit			1
" there are @entity115 , @entity8 being @entity152 , but of those who are @entity66 , most tend to be @entity10 , and they are quite cohesive in their voting patterns , " @entity146 said			2
" they always have a significant turnout compared to the voting public , giving them an additional piece of power and influence			0
they are a force , and i think they will be very helpful to gov. @entity59 in the end			0
" political observers here are quick to point out that the economy -- not faith , gender or race -- is the central issue for @entity5 voters , as it is in other key states			0
@entity5 's unemployment rate is 11.6 % , the nation 's highest			2
the foreclosure crisis devastated suburban communities in the state , and @entity115 have eagerly seized on @entity59 's interview with the @entity182 last october , when he said he preferred to let the housing market " run its course and hit bottom " instead of intervening to help homeowners			2
but few here expect external factors to dampen @entity59 's support among @entity16 voters			1
there are also a number of @entity16 candidates running for office this year up and down the ballot , which may spur church members to show up in greater numbers come november			0
sen. @entity199 , whose re-election fight against @entity202 rep. @entity201 is among the most closely watched @entity3 races in the country , is a member of the church			0
there are also five competitive state @entity3 races that could decide which party controls the upper body of the legislature in @entity212			0
in four of those races , the @entity10 candidates are @entity66			2
@entity59 campaign aides , notoriously guarded when discussing their candidate 's faith , say they are not approaching @entity16 voters differently than anyone else			1
" @entity5 has been disproportionately hurt by president @entity222 's policies , " said @entity219 , @entity59 's top adviser in the state			1
" regardless of your age or gender or religious affiliation or geographic location , within this state you have been touched in a negative way by some @entity222 policy			0
" mormon backers build support for former bishop but the official line from @entity59 - world is n't stopping his @entity16 supporters from tapping into their own ready - made church networks -- which are organized locally into wards , stakes or branches -- to build support for the former @entity243 governor , who was once a bishop in @entity245 suburb of @entity246			1
@entity247 , a @entity16 who was active in @entity250 's campaign but said he is nonetheless " pretty proud " of @entity59 , said several of his fellow church members are cross-checking church directories with voter registration data to identify and contact potential @entity59 backers			1
@entity247 said a popular smartphone app called @entity256 , which lists phone numbers and addresses for local stake members , has become a reliable resource for enterprising @entity59 volunteers doing voter outreach , despite church rules that forbid the use of @entity66 resources for political purposes			2
" the church makes it really easy for you to get a hold of anyone in your ward , " @entity247 said			0
" if you are a @entity59 supporter in the church , you have an opportunity to talk to everyone in your ward that already has a relationship of trust with you			0
" he added , " i 'm sure the campaigns and the church are saying ' you ca n't do that , ' but people will fall on their sword for @entity59 and some people will justify the means			0
" @entity59 's support among @entity19 may also be felt in @entity5 outside the voting booth			1
@entity59 supporters traveled all the way to @entity288 and @entity289 from @entity290 in @entity291 , @entity141 , to assist in the victory effort during the primaries -- and @entity10 expect that to happen again this fall , particularly in the western swing states of @entity5 and @entity295			1
several @entity5 @entity10 told @entity296 they are counting on a flood of @entity16 volunteers from reliably red @entity141 and reliably blue @entity299 to travel into @entity5 for the get - out - the - vote effort			1
one @entity66 member involved in election planning , who did not want to be identified revealing party strategy , said the arrival of out - of - state @entity19 in @entity5 " will happen in a huge way " this fall			2
another veteran @entity10 operative in the state who was not authorized by his organization to speak on the record said @entity16 volunteers will be a fundamental part of the @entity59 ground game in @entity5			1
" you tell them to be there at 8 a.m. , and they are there at 7:55 , " said the operative			0
" @entity59 is their guy			0

@entity5 's rapid population growth has diluted @entity16 influence on elections
impact of @entity16 voters is felt most in @entity10 races
@entity10 strategists hope that @entity66 vote will be enough to tip tight election
@entity59 's @entity16 backers are tapping into church network to build support
