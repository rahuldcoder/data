@entity1 it 's the new @entity3 civil war			1
@entity3 presidential hopefuls -- all too aware of the party 's disconnect with the middle class -- are in a fierce competition among each other to prove they 're the candidate who can give voice to the struggles of @entity13 left behind by the uneven economic recovery			1
the potential 2016 candidates are working to prove that @entity16 are n't the only ones sensitive to the nation 's growing economic inequality			1
the @entity3 is also trying to move past serious stumbles -- such as @entity21 's infamous 47 % comment -- that created an impression among some middle class voters that the party is out of touch			1
the effort was on full display wednesday when @entity29 went to @entity30 , one of @entity13 's most economically distressed cities , to bemoan the challenges faced by the middle class			1
" the recovery has been everywhere but in the family paychecks , " @entity29 said			0
" the opportunity gap is the defining issue of our time			1
" @entity29 has plenty of competition from fellow @entity3 seizing on the economy as they eye the @entity44			1
@entity45 has devoted a book to the issue			0
@entity48 recently sounded more like a @entity16 populist than a @entity3 firebrand when he lamented the share of income earned by the top 1 %			1
@entity53 often stresses his humble origins while @entity55 boasts of shopping at @entity56			0
of course , there are plenty of political upsides to the @entity3 refining its economic messaging			1
the appeal to the middle class could blunt similar @entity16 talking points and create a contrast to criticisms of @entity67 's more refined lifestyle			1
@entity68 , the pollster who helped coin the " where are the jobs " mantra for @entity71 in 2010 , says the @entity3 message in 2016 should be just as simple : " where is the middle class ? " but the strategy could be tough to pull off when headline economic numbers are improving			1
the unemployment rate is 5.6 % -- a level not seen since the precrisis summer of 2008 -- and consumer confidence has bounced back			0
" the economy finally feels to be in what we call a self sustaining economic expansion , " said @entity81 , chief economist at @entity82			0
" we 've reached this inflection point			0
" that will force the @entity3 to articulate a more nuanced critique of the economy during the @entity91 years			1
there is plenty of data to help them			0
median net worth of upper - income families was around $ 640,000 in 2013 , close to seven times the $ 96,500 figure for middle - income families			2
this was the highest gap in 30 years , according to the @entity103 's analysis of @entity105 data released in december			2
potential @entity3 candidates are honing in on prevailing weak spots in the economy , including stubbornly low wages that are not catching up with the rising cost of living and weak labor force participation			1
they say it 's too soon for @entity91 and @entity16 to trumpet the recovery			1
" we are creating a lot more jobs now , but we 're not generating any income ; we 're not attracting people back into the labor force , " said @entity114 , president of the @entity115 and economic adviser to @entity117 in 2008			0
" that 's short of complete victory			0
" still , the @entity3 focus on the economy could backfire if the party looks like it 's nitpicking in a search of problems or overlooking legitimate improvements			1
@entity132 , chief @entity13 economist at @entity133 , predicted that the unemployment rate would be below 5 % by the end of this year and approach 4 % in 2016			0
that would significantly undercut a key @entity3 talking point that @entity91 has n't created jobs			2
" i 'm not sure how powerful those arguments will be , " @entity132 said			0
" it 's much easier to make those arguments when the unemployment 's up at 8 % as it was for much of 2012			2
" that 's what @entity16 are banking on			2
" it takes away a lot of the talking points of the @entity3 -- that the sky is falling ... economically , " said @entity147 , @entity91 's former chief of staff			2
" and ( @entity16 ) are not on the defensive as much as they would have been a year , a year - and - a - half , two years ago			2
" @entity3 candidates will have to prove they are doing more than stealing @entity16 messaging			1
and then there is the long term			0
despite intense debate , neither party has come up with answers to generational economic questions , which go far deeper than the 2008 recession			0
the @entity13 , like many other developed nations , is locked in a period of structural economic change			0
millions of manufacturing and clerical jobs have been outsourced			0
technology has made some trades obsolete			0
and jobs that are being created often pay less and carry fewer benefits than those of the past			0
but @entity3 see an opportunity			1
there are signs of trouble for @entity16 among blue collar workers that the @entity3 could jump on to improve its hopes of winning swing states			1
in 2008 , for example , 58 % of white , noncollege graduates voted @entity3 and 40 % went @entity16			1
in november 's midterm elections , 64 % of the same demographic voted @entity3 and 34 % chose @entity16			1
improving its standing among those who are slightly better off could also help the @entity3 in battlegrounds such as @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			2
and some @entity3 believe a more inclusive economic argument could help repair ties with the @entity193 community			2
progressive commentators say they are glad @entity3 are talking about income inequality but doubt their sincerity			2
@entity197 of the @entity198 said the @entity3 might not be denigrating those struggling in today 's economy , but their policies still are a case of " slapping lipstick on a pig			2
" " there is a radical shift , " he said			0
" to acknowledge a problem is a huge first step			0
( but ) the real opportunity lies with the public in making demands that will force the politicians to listen			0
" other analysts argue that while @entity3 are talking about helping the middle class , they are blocking attempts by the president to pass laws that would do just that -- for instance , on raising the minimum wage , creating jobs through infrastructure investment and hiking taxes on the rich to pay for middle class tax breaks			1
" one thing that you have to watch for is people just tacking the words poverty and inequality onto a pre-existing agenda that has very little to do with addressing those problems , " said @entity225 , a former top chief economics adviser to vice president @entity226			0
" for the most part , i hear lots of the same trickle - down economics that helped to get us into this mess in the first place			0

@entity3 knew after 2012 they had a problem with the middle class
presidential hopefuls are *vying* to talk about opportunity gap and poverty
@entity16 see a change of *rhetoric* , not change of policy
