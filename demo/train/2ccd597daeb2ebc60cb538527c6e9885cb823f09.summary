almost anyone living in @entity1 age 16 or over on the day of the referendum will be able to vote			1
but voters in the rest of the @entity4 -- @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity80 -- do not get a say on what could be a historic change			2
that includes @entity1 who live outside @entity1 's borders			2

" let no one in @entity1 be in any doubt : we desperately want you to stay ; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart , " he wrote			1

our message to the @entity1 people will be simple : ' we want you to stay			1
' " former @entity3 warns of damage a @entity122 poll carried out monday suggests that people in @entity26 and @entity27 are opposed to @entity1 independence by a substantial majority , with 60 % opposed to 19 % in favor			1
former conservative prime minister @entity127 , writing wednesday in the @entity128 , warned that if @entity1 votes for independence , it and all the @entity4 would suffer as a result			1
" the @entity4 would be weaker in every international body and , most damagingly , within the @entity133 , " he wrote			0
" our chance of reforming the @entity133 would be diminished , and the risk of our exit from it enhanced			0
" @entity3 has promised to hold a referendum on @entity4 membership of the @entity133 by the end of 2017 if he remains prime minister after the general election next year			1

" @entity184 ' is above politics ' @entity186 has made clear that @entity184 will not take a position on the @entity1 referendum amid @entity4 media reports that lawmakers are urging her to intervene on behalf of the union			1
" the @entity194 's constitutional impartiality is an established principle of our democracy and one which the @entity184 has demonstrated throughout her reign , " a palace statement said			1
" as such , the @entity184 is above politics , and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case			1
" any suggestion that the @entity184 should wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong			1
this is a matter for the people of @entity1			0
