@entity0 -- the @entity3 man thought he put his past behind him , but then he became victim to an online scam associated more with the mafia than the @entity9			1
he is alleging in a federal lawsuit that three websites are running an extortion racket preying on his history as a one - time registered sex offender			1
the alleged shakedown is a growing trend in cyberspace that also includes " ransomware " -- another extortion scheme that uses fake police and @entity23 warnings to demand money in exchange for unfreezing data on your computer , experts say			1
in the case of the @entity3 man and nine other plaintiffs , their lawsuit accuses three websites of trying to extort $ 500 in exchange for removing their names and photographs from sites purporting to list sex offenders , though two of the plaintiffs are no longer listed on a state sex offender registry and another two plaintiffs , both women , have never been arrested or convicted of a sex offense or any crime , their attorney says			1
one of the women is the wife of the @entity3 man , both of whom were interviewed by @entity1 with their attorney			0
the couple declined to give their names because none of the plaintiffs is identified in a federal lawsuit filed this month in @entity3			1
" i am forever sorry for what i did , and i paid my debt to society , " the man said of his sex offense conviction in @entity60 , a crime that he declined to elaborate on			2
" i had been rightfully removed from the @entity60 ( sex offender registry ) site , and now i 'm on the other site that wants money for removal			2
" the man and woman , both in their 30s , were married last year , and the new husband was looking forward to finally being removed from the @entity60 website 10 years after he was convicted of a sex offense			1
but just as he was removed from the state government registry in january , a website claiming to list sex offenders posted his name and conviction online -- along with a link to photos of the couple , the couple said			1
the website charged him $ 79 just to verify the posting about him -- and wanted $ 421 more to remove his name , photo and the link to their personal photos			1
that amounts to extortion , the @entity3 couple alleges			2
" i did n't pay $ 421 because i do n't want to pay for a business like that , and the potential for them to list me again on their site and another site seems all too likely , " the man said			1
added his wife : " i am thrilled to be married to him , and it seems to me that these guys are literally banking on shame , and it angers me deeply that they are presuming that i would be ashamed of my husband , which i am not			0
" the lawsuit lists four individuals and 10 other unidentified persons as owning or operating three websites that allegedly function as an extortion scam in violation of the federal @entity115 ( @entity115 ) @entity116			1
the plaintiffs also cite @entity3 's " right of publicity " law , which " says you ca n't use anybody 's name or photograph to help them sell something or solicit something without prior consent , " said plaintiff attorney @entity128 of @entity129 , @entity3			1
" they 're acting in concert and they are extorting money from people , " @entity128 said of the three websites			1
the three websites did n't respond to @entity1 requests for comment			1
the four defendants did n't return calls or could not be reached for comment			1
the defendants are @entity141 of @entity142 , @entity143 ; his brother @entity141 , @entity143 ; @entity145 of @entity146 , @entity143 , who also goes by @entity148 ; and @entity149 , also of @entity146 , @entity143 , according to the lawsuit and @entity128			0
the lawsuit alleges those individuals own or work for the websites @entity153 , @entity155 and online detective			2
internet security expert @entity157 , senior vice president of @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity3 , said online extortion typically occurs when users click on a deceptive link in an e-mail -- and then suddenly a message pops up claiming to be a warning that the user has visited an illegal or illicit site			1
the computer then locks up , and the warning seeks money ranging from $ 10 to a few hundred dollars in exchange for unlocking the computer or data , @entity157 said			1
in early 2010 , @entity159 saw 5,000 cases of ransomware each quarter , but now it has grown to 200,000 cases per quarter , @entity157 said			0
" it follows e-mail and social networks			0
that 's a collective trend we 're seeing , " he said			2
ransomware has grown because it uses an efficient , anonymous payment service			0
the scam began in @entity187 and later the former @entity189 republics in @entity190			0
" by and large you have organized crime groups that took to this early , " @entity157 said			0
the ransom demand is purposefully kept to a few hundred dollars , he said			0
" obviously , if i ask you for $ 10,000 , you 're not going to pay the money , " @entity157 said			2
" so the small amount is simply to make it attractive to you to pay it and make it go away			0
" online security experts are concerned whether the extortionists will make good on their promise -- or even find a way to return to a computer and seek more money			0
" will they free the machine after you pay ? " says a @entity207 for the fourth quarter of 2012			0
" there are no guarantees , and anonymous payment systems make it basically impossible to track their movements			0
" the @entity3 husband sent an e-mail to a person who operates @entity221 , who responded under a pseudonym with a @entity225 address , the husband said			0
the husband demanded his name erased from the site			0
he refused to pay the additional $ 421 for removal			2
" they became fairly belligerent in their response and insulting , " the @entity3 man said about the e-mail response			0
" there was some profanity in there too , which they graciously asterisked out			0
" the federal lawsuit represents a legal initiative on behalf of the @entity246 organization , a nonprofit that says public sex offender registries and residency restriction laws do n't protect children and instead dehumanize individuals and their families			1
saying every sex offense should be judged on its own merits , the group asserts public money would be better spent on prevention , healing and rehabilitation			2
@entity128 is president of the @entity3 group			0
the @entity3 couple are members of the group , as is the other @entity3 plaintiff , a man in his 60s			0
he is a registered sex offender and was convicted in 1979 in @entity3 for a sex offense , the lawsuit said			2
the other plaintiffs live in @entity60 , @entity265 , @entity266 and @entity267			2
in a telephone interview with @entity1 , the @entity3 man in his 60s said he has new fears about his safety with the additional publicity from the three websites posting his name and photograph			2
in the past , he has been attacked because of his registry on the @entity3 government 's sex offender website			1
his daughter was harassed out of school because of his crime , he said			0
" it misrepresents who i am , and that opens me up for potential retaliation for vigilante violence , which i 've already experienced now twice , " the man said of the three websites			2
he discovered his name on the three sites when a friend searched his name on the @entity9 and found it listed on the three websites , he said			1
after paying the websites $ 79 for an initial inquiry into the matter , he refused to pay the additional $ 421 the sites are seeking to remove his name and photograph , he said			1
" it 's a witch hunt , " he added			0
" it 's a way to make money off the backs of those who have this horrible tag of being a sex offender , of which people do n't have a correct view of what that really means			1
they have a one - size - fits - all and ... extreme view that sex offenders are damaged humans who will always re-offend			1
" that 's not the case , " he said			0
the federal government website http://www.onguardonline.gov / offers guidance and contact information in case you find yourself dealing with cybercrime .			0
