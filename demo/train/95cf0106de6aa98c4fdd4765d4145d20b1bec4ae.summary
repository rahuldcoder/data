-- as long as there have been movies , there have been bad movies			1
for a long time , they were forgotten -- or wished to be			2
but there were those who remembered			0
one of them was @entity9			1
in the 1970s and ' 80s , he co-wrote four books on bad movies , some with brother @entity12			1
along with @entity15 's 1981 book " @entity16 , " @entity9 's works helped blaze a trail			1
the films included the high and low			0
@entity27 ' inscrutable " @entity26 " was in there ; so were " @entity21 , " " @entity22 " and the films of @entity24 " @entity25			0
@entity9 was written up in @entity30 and guested on talk - show panels			1
" we were thrilled at becoming part of the national discourse on movies that are so bad they 're good , " says @entity9 , who now writes for the film and ticketing site @entity34			1
some of his targets were n't so thrilled			0
@entity9 remembers sharing a couch on the old " @entity42 " with @entity43			1
" he accused me of making money off of bad movies , " @entity9 recalls			1
" i told him he had made millions off of his own bad movies , so i did n't see the problem			1
" other actors can only smile and shrug			0
@entity51 , no stranger to bad films , told @entity0 that she made one film because it earned her a trip to @entity55			2
@entity56 , who starred in " jaws : the @entity58 , " once wrote , " i have never seen it , but by all accounts , it is terrible			0
however , i have seen the house that it built , and it is terrific			0
" gradually , @entity65 detritus got more attention from the mainstream			1
@entity68 and his colleagues created " @entity70 , " which featured the cast watching bad movies and yelling jokes at the screen			1
the show ran from 1988 to 1999			0
putting @entity65 's biggest bombs back together @entity68 , who confesses that " when i was a kid , i thought @entity77 made the movies , " says that he could always find something good in what he was joking about			1
" when you write ( the riffs ) , you spend a lot of time with the film , " says the comedian			2
" there are certain things that you ca n't get over , like certain performances that are great , but they 're within the body of this ( bad ) movie			0
" these days there 's an afterlife well beyond " @entity70			1
" @entity9 mentions there 's a book in the works about the production of " @entity21			2
" the making of " the @entity101 , " a 1964 film about a man - eating alien , has inspired the more dramatic " creep ! " , about the con - man director behind the film			0
" @entity107 : @entity107 " is being restored , thanks to a @entity110 campaign			0
" @entity116 , " which @entity117 called " the ' @entity118 ' of bad movies , " has led to " @entity111 " - like midnight - movie participation , a video game , a live reading and a book coming in october			1
@entity120 on hits , flops and surprises if you want the original bad stuff more or less straight , there are also live events to harness your happiness			0
@entity68 occasionally tours with his " @entity130 " show ; former " @entity70 " writer and host @entity131 has a show called " @entity134			1
" ( if you want to play at home , @entity136 has been issuing dvds of " @entity70 " episodes ; volume @entity139 is due july 23			2
) it all goes to show that there are many paths to immortality			0
the " @entity145 " creators used @entity9 's inclusion to create a franchise , for example			2
and @entity25 ? the man became the subject of an @entity152 - winning film			0
" @entity25 's widow was not exactly thrilled when we lauded him with the @entity155 as ' the worst director of all time , ' " says @entity9			2
" ( but ) we helped bring an underground cult for ' @entity159 ' above ground			0
i think @entity25 would have enjoyed the resulting attention			0

@entity65 has long history of bad movies , but few paid attention until ' 70s
@entity9 one of the *leaders* in calling attention to film badness
" @entity70 , " " @entity130 , " " @entity134 " *invite* participation
some bad movies have long afterlife
