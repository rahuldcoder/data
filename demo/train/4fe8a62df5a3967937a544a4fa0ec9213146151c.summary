-- simply put , it 's impossible to imagine the past 50 years of rock without @entity3 , who died sunday at 71			1
glam rock , punk and various strains of ' 80s and ' 90s indie and alternative rock would simply vanish without his example			1
every @entity13 rocker in a black leather jacket , from the @entity15 to the @entity16 , stands in @entity3 's shadow			1
@entity19 's early gender - bending persona was explicitly in @entity3 's debt			1
his songbook was a building block for rock 's front ranks in the ' 80s and ' 90s : @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29			1
even peers of his band the @entity31 looked up to it			0
the @entity35 ' 1968 song " @entity37 , " @entity36 later admitted , came from trying to emulate sound of the @entity40 ' " @entity39			1
" appreciation : @entity3 , the minimalist god yet @entity3 was the first rock star that was n't actually a star			1
only one of the four classic albums he made with the @entity31 from 1967 to 1970 -- 1969 's " @entity31 " -- made the " @entity47 " album chart , peaking at just 197			2
he would not climb high on the chart until 1972 , when his solo single " @entity50 " -- produced by @entity19 -- reached no. 16 , a position he never again came near			0
" if something of mine ever got popular , maybe i could 've stuck with that , " he told @entity52 in 2008			0
" but that was never the point			0
" and those were long - term			0
" you may be drawing a circle for the thousandth time , " he told @entity60 in 2000 , " but maybe it 's a slightly better circle			2
" nevertheless , he became infamous -- and grew visibly weary of being infamous -- for singing about pursuing pleasures of the flesh well past the mandates of healthy , polite society			2
@entity69 had opened pop songwriting up to just about any topic , but @entity3 's refusal to flinch while singing about sadomasochism ( 1967 's " @entity74 , " or the 1969 recording " @entity76 , " released on the great 1985 outtakes compilation " @entity31 " ) and hard drugs on " @entity75 " and " @entity39 " ( both 1967 ) was unheard of in rock ' n ' roll -- or really any music			1
so were the screeching , feedback - laden guitars			0
that thorniness was ingrained in @entity3 's public persona , in his unflinching demeanor and permanently alienated worldview			1
@entity86 , his old @entity31 band mate , described @entity3 as gratuitously vicious , once " the most difficult person to work with i have ever known			1
" @entity3 was , by many accounts , a fearsome challenge to interview ; an anthology could be made of his most withering journalistic encounters ( such as the @entity92 above )			2
artistically , @entity3 could be equally contrarian			2
in 1975 , he issued a double - lp , " @entity93 , " containing over an hour of machine - generated feedback , to critical howls , dismal sales and irritated fans			0
his last release , 2011 's " @entity98 " -- a heavily improvisational collaboration with @entity100 -- was similarly derided			0
@entity101 , writing in @entity103 , called it " appalling , " while @entity105 gave it a 1.0 ( out of 10.0 )			0
as ever , @entity3 proudly did whatever he damn well felt like			2
as a guitarist and songwriter , he practiced a conscious musical primitivism			0
the quote from @entity3 flying around @entity111 the fastest in the wake of his death goes : " one chord is fine			2
two chords are pushing it			0
three chords , and you 're into jazz			0
" but rock was @entity3 's lifeline			1
in a 1966 magazine essay written before the @entity31 took off , @entity3 declared , " the only decent poetry of this century was that recorded on rock - and - roll records			1
" while that may have been an exaggeration -- @entity3 studied under poet @entity127 at @entity128 and was in that poet 's thrall for the rest of his life -- it candidly reflected his ardor for the music			1
having done so much to inspire punk and post-punk , @entity3 became a paterfamilias of the @entity13 rock scene around @entity140 's and @entity142 's @entity141 in the 1970s ; one of his finest solo albums , 1978 's " @entity145 , " nodded to that scene			1
( it also featured a vocal cameo from another fan , @entity149			0
) it was the beginning of the phenomenon rock producer @entity152 would allude to in 1982 interview with journalist @entity154 , when he noted that while a relatively modest number of people bought copies of 1967 's " @entity157 , " everyone who bought one started a band			2
that process accelerated through the ' 80s			0
by 1986 , @entity167 of @entity169 's @entity168 -- whose sneak - attack approach to loud choruses was adapted by , among others , @entity28 -- was singing " i wan na be a singer like @entity3 " on the band 's first release , " @entity174			1
" punk rock and its many offspring were n't all that @entity3 touched			1
in 1990 , the rap group @entity177 sampled @entity179 ' rolling bass line from " @entity50 " on its hit , " @entity181			0
" @entity3 was a longstanding hip - hop fan ; one of his last public acts was publishing a widely read paean to @entity187 's " @entity186			1
" " there are moments of supreme beauty and greatness on this record , and then some of it is the same old s --- " @entity3 wrote			2
" but the guy really , really , really is talented			0
" sounds a lot like the guy who wrote it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity204 : impossible to imagine past 50 years of rock without @entity3
he says glam , punk and all alt rock in his debt ; @entity35 , @entity29 , @entity27 among those influenced
his music transgressed , with topics such as @entity216 , hard drugs ; his view alienated , he says
@entity220 : @entity221 was @entity3 's poetry , and he became paterfamilias to @entity13 's rock scene
