" it 's a great shame , because i had a good potential and could have started on the front , my pace is good with the bike , but it 's like this			0
tomorrow from the fourth row everything will be harder and more difficult , " added the @entity31			0
nine - time world champion @entity1 has returned to form this season and chased @entity12 home in the latest round in @entity36 in @entity37 , but the whole field has struggled to match the defending title holder this season			1
home rider @entity41 came within 0.18 seconds of snatching pole from @entity12 , with @entity13 's two - time world champion @entity43 on a @entity9 third fastest			1
@entity12 's teammate @entity44 -- the lap record holder at @entity8 -- was fourth best ahead of another @entity47 , @entity48 of ~ @entity9			0
the two @entity49 's of @entity50 of @entity51 and @entity31 @entity52 were sixth and eighth with another @entity53 , @entity54 , in seventh			0
