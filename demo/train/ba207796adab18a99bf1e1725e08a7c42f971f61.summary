" i do n't believe i have to prove to the world that i am a success only because i have a husband and two children and two grandchildren , " says @entity0 , who split childcare with her husband while head of the @entity13 @entity12 's computer division			1
" that 's me , that 's my life , that 's what i wanted to do			1
" after graduating from @entity23 with a masters in math , @entity0 was was scouted to join the @entity13 @entity12 ( @entity26 ) in 1973 while working at a software company			1

" " it really appealed to me , because i felt i could serve my country , " she says			1
she spent 12 years with the service , initially as a consultant , but eventually launching its it division			1
she says being the first and only female manager at the @entity13 @entity12 was not as difficult as convincing the organization that it needed to adopt new technology			1
" they knew absolutely nothing about @entity39 , " she recalls			1
" more than that , they really hated the idea			2
" @entity0 also brought wide - sweeping technology adoption to the @entity4 , which she joined as chief information officer in 1986 before becoming ceo in 2006			1

on " having it all " ... it 's pure nonsense			2
i do n't know the meaning of ' have it all			2
' everyone should have what they would like to have			2
if someone becomes a manager and she does n't have a family , i do n't think that she does n't have it all			2
maybe that 's the way she likes things			2
( people ) should do what they believe is right , not what society believes is right for them			2
more from leading women : female racer 's lessons from life in the fast lane on childcare ... my husband and i split the responsibility , and we were helped by other people from time to time			2
we both managed to have careers			2
but that was so uncommon at the time that , at first , i pitied myself and said " i 'm working harder and look at the men ! " and then , i realized that he 's paying a higher price			0
i do n't believe he looked at it as a sacrifice			0
that 's the life we built together and it was very natural			0

@entity13 are hard workers and they invest a lot			1
when you do n't have natural resources , you need brain resources , and that 's how the hi - tech community and the biotech community came to life			0

on the @entity178 ... what should happen is that the citizens will realize that they have to pay in order to bring @entity182 back to what it used to be and what it should be			0
