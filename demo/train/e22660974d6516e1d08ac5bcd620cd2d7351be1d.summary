@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 opted for a special election to fill a newly vacant @entity6 seat through 2014 instead of appointing a replacement through that time , saying the decision was about giving voters " a choice and a voice in the process " and was not driven by political self - interest			1
while the @entity16 's decision for a special october ballot could help him avoid stronger @entity19 turnout in his re-election bid a month later , it also opens him up to criticism from his own party that is on the short end of the balance of power in the @entity6			1
@entity2 explained his decision one day after the @entity3 's senior senator , @entity26 , a @entity27 , died at 89 after an illness			1
@entity2 said he would name a placeholder as soon as possible to fill the seat until the october election			1
opinion : the last ' swamp dog ' @entity19 immediately slammed the move , asserting that @entity2 is wasting taxpayer money to protect his ambitions			2
@entity39 were n't critical but they did n't praise the governor , either			0
@entity2 announced that @entity19 and @entity16 primary elections will be held on august 13 with the general election on october 16			1
the winner of the special election will serve out the final year of @entity26 's term , and an election for a full six - year term will occur the following november			1
@entity2 sets october special election to replace @entity26 voters should have say while @entity2 said state law allowed him to name a replacement for the remaining year - and - a - half of @entity26 's term , he believes an appointment over that period of time was not suitable or fair			1
" the issues facing the @entity6 are too critically important and the decisions that need to be dealt with too vital not too have an elected representative making those decisions who was voted on and decided on by the people of this state			0
these decisions should be made by an elected official who represents the will of voters of @entity3 , " @entity2 said			1
the expense of an election is also an issue during an era of belt tightening			0
the @entity3 @entity71 , an administrative wing of the @entity27 - controlled state legislature , estimates it will cost $ 12 million to state taxpayers to conduct a primary and another $ 12 million for a general election			2
analysis : @entity2 helps himself @entity3 is already voting in a general election on november 5 , when @entity2 is bidding for a second term			1
so some ask why does n't he save $ 12 million and schedule a special general election a few weeks later ? @entity2 said state law only permits the option of an october special election or an election in 2014			1
@entity2 said " there 's no political purpose " behind his decision on the election date			1
but polls show that he has a 2 - 1 advantage over state sen. @entity95 , his @entity19 challenger			2
and putting a special @entity6 election on the same day in november would most likely increase @entity19 turnout , especially if @entity99 mayor @entity98 is on the ballot			1
@entity98 was considering his own run for @entity6 in 2014			0
by placing the special @entity6 election in october , @entity2 avoids @entity19 turnout tied to this issue possibly becoming a problem for him			1
@entity19 unhappy national democrats quickly blasted the decision			2
" governor @entity2 might not know or care how many millions of taxpayer dollars his special election gambit will waste , but the people of @entity3 certainly do			1
@entity2 should do the right thing , protect @entity3 taxpayer dollars instead of his own political career , and hold the @entity6 election on the same day as his own , " @entity111 executive director @entity110 , said in a statement			1
@entity2 said that the costs associated with special primary and general elections " can not be measured " against the value of an elected senator " when so many consequential issues are being debated and determined this year			2
" state democrats had threatened legal action if @entity2 pushed the election back to november 2014 , but @entity2 's not sure if his decision averts a legal challenge , adding , " in @entity3 , people sue over everything			1
" opinion : the last ' swamp dog ' @entity2 said he has yet to decide on a placeholder			0
but he said he has a list in his head and that he 'll make a determination relatively soon			0
" i 'm looking for a person who 's going to be a good @entity142 senator , " he said			0
the outspoken governor also said it would n't be fair to appoint a @entity16 placeholder to serve out the remainder of the late @entity19 senator 's term			2
" i understand the political advantage that would come to me if i was the person , the sole person , to decide who would be in the @entity6 representing @entity3 for 18 months , but i just did not feel comfortable doing that , " he said			2
@entity2 did n't say at the news conference whether the placeholder will be allowed to run in the special election , but a source close to the governor told @entity1 , " legally the appointee could run if he or she wanted to , but would have to go through the election process			1
" republicans not praising @entity2 @entity39 were n't criticizing @entity2 's decision , but they were n't praising it , either			2
" i am sure the governor exercised whatever option he had in the best interest of his state and i wo n't question the path that he has chosen , " senate minority leader @entity163 said			0
@entity2 's decision could complicate his already - strained relationship with national conservatives , which could spell trouble if he decides to run for president in 2016			0
" i was disappointed he did n't pick a @entity16 to fill out the rest of the term , but not surprised , " said @entity175 , the former chairman of the @entity176			0
" @entity2 has always done what 's best for @entity2 in @entity3 , " added @entity175 , whose state is traditionally one of the first to cast ballots in the presidential primary process			1
many on the right are still upset with @entity2 's praise of president @entity188 personally and the federal response in the wake of @entity191 , just days before last november 's presidential election			2
@entity16 : ' debilitating stupidity ' while @entity2 's approval rating in @entity3 soared after @entity191 and has remained high , some commentators in his own party blasted him for his praise of @entity188 , saying it contributed to the defeat of @entity16 nominee @entity201			2
and @entity19 were quick to point that out			0
" republicans have not won a @entity6 race in @entity3 in more than 40 years			0
their only shot was an appointee who had a year and a half to establish themselves before an election in 2014 , " @entity206 deputy executive director @entity205 said			0
" with this news , i assume operatives at the @entity214 are busy planning @entity2 's defeat in @entity216 and @entity217 right now			0
" meanwhile , the rival @entity214 pointed toward what could be a divisive @entity19 primary			0
" democrats will now face an ugly primary sprint between @entity98 , @entity223 and @entity224 -- all with substantial war chests and a healthy dislike for each other , " @entity214 spokesman @entity225 said			0
" @entity98 did not want to have to wrap this up in two months			0
" @entity19 congressman @entity230 may also make a bid for the @entity6 seat			0
@entity1 @entity6 producer @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
