-- you can blame that third cup of @entity3 on your genes			0

perfect your coffee pour - over the research was led by @entity13 of the @entity14 , and published on tuesday by the journal @entity16			1
" overall , we have known for a long time that there are some genetic components for our coffee - consuming behaviors , " @entity17 told @entity0			0
researchers were able to identify six regions in human dna that were not previously linked to coffee - drinking behavior , which could explain why one drinker will lie awake at night twitching after one cup while another can gulp down the whole pot before their @entity31 cycle			2
the study analyzed data from several studies that polled more than 120,000 people on how much coffee they drink a day , then scanned their dna			2
