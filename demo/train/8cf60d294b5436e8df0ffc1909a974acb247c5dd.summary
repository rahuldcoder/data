@entity0 , @entity1 -- the family of a mentally ill @entity5 man sentenced to death in @entity1 for blasphemy is calling on authorities to release him			1
a court in the city of @entity11 last week handed down the punishment to @entity13 , 69 , over charges alleging that he wrote letters claiming to be a prophet			1
but his family , his lawyer and a @entity5 legal aid group say the court failed to take into account the mental state of @entity13 , who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia			1
the sentencing hearing took place last week behind closed doors without his legal team 's knowledge , they say , and his lawyer has been blocked from visiting him since			1
" we are really upset and concerned that they will never release him and that he will die in jail , " his family said in a statement released monday by the @entity5 legal aid and advocacy group @entity33			2
" he has already attempted suicide unsuccessfully			0
" @entity13 was convicted under @entity1 's controversial blasphemy law , which human rights groups say is used to settle personal scores and persecute minorities			1
now , his family and lawyer are concerned that his legal team will be prevented from meeting a key deadline this week to file an appeal that they say would keep important evidence about his mental health admissible in the case			1
history of mental illness @entity13 was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2010 in @entity56 , @entity57 , the city where he was living at the time , and kept under observation in the hospital for over a month			1
later that year , he traveled with his wife to @entity1 , where he owns a number of properties			2

under @entity1 law , blasphemy against the @entity71 is punishable by death or life imprisonment			1
a @entity1 law firm took up his case and has been working on it for the past three years			2
the lawyer for the firm who has been representing @entity13 spoke to @entity2 about the case on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns -- the firm has received threats in the past			2
the lawyer says @entity13 denies sending the letters , describing the case as the result of a property dispute that turned bad			2
tackling religious intolerance and violence in @entity1 ' @entity96 jail conditions ' @entity13 's family and legal team have criticized his treatment in jail and the way the @entity1 court system handled the case			1
" the dates kept being moved forward so that by the time the trial concluded he had already been in horrific jail conditions sharing a cell with several other men for three years , " the family said in its statement			0
" throughout this time he had minimum access to medication that might have helped his mental illness			0
" in early 2012 , he tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide , his lawyer says , and spent time in the hospital recovering			0
a medical report about his mental state , provided to the court around that time , was flawed and lacked proper psychiatric assessment , the lawyer says			0
psychiatrists willing to testify in the case were deterred because of direct threats to their security , the lawyer says			0
an independent analysis of @entity130 's case by the @entity131 stressed the need to put him on suicide watch saying " his threats to commit suicide can not be taken lightly			0
" opinion : a war is raging against free speech appeal deadline looming the legal team that had been working on his case was replaced by a state counsel in the final stages of the trial after filing a request to have the judge replaced on the grounds of probably bias , @entity33 said			2
members of the legal team have been visiting @entity13 at @entity11 's @entity151 , known as @entity152 , where he is being held			1
but they are no longer able to get permission to see him			0
that 's a big issue because the lawyers have until thursday to file an appeal before the @entity157			0
if they do n't make the deadline , an automatic " jail appeal " will be filed			0
in that case , @entity13 's lawyers " will be barred from raising crucial evidence of mr. @entity13 's mental health and other fair trial issues on appeal , " @entity33 says			1
@entity13 's lawyer told @entity2 that without a proper appeal , the case might languish in the court system for years			1
the lawyer said that considering @entity13 's frail mental health and suicidal tendencies , she fears he " might not survive " that time period			1
his relatives say they want @entity1 to release him so " he can be treated appropriately for his medical condition			2
" baroness @entity178 , a senior official at the @entity179 , said in a statement that @entity5 will be raising concerns over @entity13 's sentence " in the strongest possible terms with the @entity1 government			1
" @entity1 officials were n't immediately available for comment on the matter tuesday			0
judges under pressure accusations of blasphemy often unleash fierce passions in @entity1 , drawing angry crowds who gather outside court hearings demanding punishment before cases have even been heard			2
" so much pressure is on the police and judiciary to take action that even in the face of overwhelming evidence of innocence or shoddy evidence against the accused , no judge is willing to be seen to be lenient , " @entity13 's lawyer told @entity2			1
" there was a mob outside the police station when @entity13 was arrested , there was a mob outside the hospital when he was rushed there after attempting suicide , " she said			0
" people leak information and put pressure on the justice system			0
" although human rights advocates say minorities are often the targets of blasphemy charges , the @entity217 of @entity1 says the majority of people accused of or imprisoned for blasphemy are @entity224			1
@entity1 's population is overwhelmingly @entity224			1
in january 2011 , @entity227 governor @entity226 was shot to death by one of his security guards after publicly supporting a @entity232 woman accused of blasphemy and calling for a change in the law			2
in 2012 , the case of a @entity236 , a @entity232 teenager accused of blasphemy , caused an international outcry			0
charges against her were eventually dropped , but she and her family were forced to go into hiding			0
that 's why @entity13 's lawyers are so concerned about his safety			1
members of the firm representing him have faced direct threats to their safety because of the case , his lawyer said			0
