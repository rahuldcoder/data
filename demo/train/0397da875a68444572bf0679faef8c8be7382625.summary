@entity0 -- as gov. @entity2 continues to fend off accusations of corruption in @entity5 , another @entity6 with possible designs on the @entity8 , @entity9 , spent last week 7,000 miles away from the controversy , burnishing his foreign policy resume with a three - country trip through @entity14			1
the @entity16 senator made a busy , weeklong visit to the @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- a trip that brought him face to face with top officials from all three countries , the boxer @entity24 and a pair of @entity28 - stationed @entity27 soldiers , who took pictures of the man who one day may sit in the @entity8			2
the ranking member of the @entity33 and @entity32 , @entity9 was making his first jaunt to @entity14 , a region he called the next big flash point in global affairs			1
" all of the emerging major issues of the 21st century over the next 50 years are going to be in @entity14 , given the population growth , and given the instability that you see in @entity27 , given the rise of @entity45 , " @entity9 told @entity1 in a weekend phone interview from @entity38 , @entity20			1
the three countries he visited " want us here , " @entity9 said			1
" and not just engaged militarily , but they want us engaged economically , culturally			0
they are comfortable with us			0
they 've built these longstanding alliances that they want to build on and improve			0
" @entity9 : culture keeps @entity55 - @entity54 bond strong @entity9 affirmed the importance of @entity55 's economic and military interests in @entity14 and expressed support for the so - called " rebalance " -- the @entity61 administration 's effort to re-engage with @entity14 by forging deeper alliances with friendly nations and pursuing a stable relationship with @entity45			1
" in fairness , i think they 're doing a lot of the things we need to be doing , " he said			0
but @entity55 's relationship with its allies in the region must evolve , he said , in the face of @entity45 's ever - growing economic might and the " destabilizing " threat of a volatile @entity27			1
" our military capacity here has to be adjusted to a new threat , " @entity9 said of the roughly 30,000 @entity55 military personnel stationed in @entity20			1
" much of our military standing here is still and was very largely based on the ability to slow down an invasion from the @entity27 long enough until reserves and supplements could get here , " he said			0
" and that still remains a threat to some extent			0
but the bigger threat now is that they 've developed long - range missile capabilities , long - range artillery , anti-access , anti-ship weaponry , these are the sort of things			0
these are a different type of threat that now requires us to reposition a different kind of technology and capacity to the region			0
" @entity9 blasts @entity61 administration , pushes @entity55 leadership abroad @entity9 said simmering tensions between @entity19 and @entity45 , inflamed by recent @entity45 efforts to expand its military influence in the @entity112 , are very real -- and shared by leaders in the @entity18			1
" the takeaway , if you go to @entity19 or the @entity18 , the takeaway is that @entity45 is trying to become dominant , that @entity45 is driving the @entity55 out , " @entity9 said			1
" all of this weighs heavily on the minds of nations in this region , particularly the @entity18 and @entity19			2
there is a growing insecurity about some of the claims that @entity45 is making with regards to what is in their territory			0
" the @entity20 outlook on @entity45 is more nuanced , he said			0
@entity20 's economy depends heavily on exports , and @entity45 is far and away the biggest market for its goods			0
the @entity55 should have a similar approach to the @entity14 superpower , he said , as long as those economic interests are balanced with a robust military presence in the region to protect @entity55 's allies			1
" i 've never accepted the idea that we wanted to contain @entity45 , " @entity9 said			2
" we welcome a @entity45 that 's richer and more prosperous , because that 's a potential trading partner , customers for our products and services			2
what we do n't want to see is a @entity45 that uses its newfound power to dominate their neighbors			0
" @entity9 was accompanied on his @entity151 tour by two close aides from @entity0 : his chief of staff @entity153 , whose family hails from the @entity18 , and his foreign policy adviser @entity156 , a veteran of @entity158 's administration and the former executive director of the @entity160 , a neoconservative think tank			1
his aides tweeted out a cascade of pictures of @entity9 meeting with top elected and diplomatic officials , @entity18 president @entity167 , @entity20 president @entity168 and @entity19 prime minister @entity169 among them			2
@entity9 also consulted with two officials whose fame extends far beyond political circles : @entity24 , a member of the @entity174 when he is n't wearing boxing gloves , and @entity176 , the @entity55 ambassador to @entity19			1
" she 's very highly regarded in @entity19 , " he said of @entity176			0
" she seems to be enjoying the job tremendously			0
i 've got nothing but positive reviews about her			0
" in a friday speech to the @entity184 in @entity38 , @entity9 said @entity55 engagement in @entity14 is crucial to @entity55 national security and economic vitality			1
he chided , ever so gently , unnamed members of @entity174 who are " increasingly skeptical about why @entity55 needs to remain so active in international affairs			2
" asked if the comment was a reference to libertarian - leaning @entity6 -- among them sen. @entity193 of @entity194 , a potential rival for the 2016 @entity6 nomination -- @entity9 said it was not			1
" there 's a general debate in our country , " he said			0
@entity55 have gone through two bloody , costly , overseas engagements in wars in @entity204 and @entity205 , one of which is still going on			2
@entity55 have paid a tremendous price to fight the war on terrorism , and it 's understandable that they 're weary of overseas engagements			1
" " but so much of what is going on in our everyday lives is directly impacted by things that are happening halfway around the world , " @entity9 told @entity1			2
" and that even if we chose to ignore the world , the world 's problems are not going to ignore us			0
so i think it 's critically important that we continue to invest in foreign policy and foreign diplomacy and in military capacity , because they are as relevant today as they have ever been			1
