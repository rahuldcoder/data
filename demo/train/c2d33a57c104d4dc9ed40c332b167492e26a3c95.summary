@entity0 -- monkeys on cocaine			2
new windows for a closed visitor 's center			0
modern dance as a tool for software development			0
a report released tuesday by conservative sens. @entity11 and @entity12 cited these and 97 other projects as leading examples of misguided or wasteful spending under the @entity18 administration 's $ 862 billion economic stimulus bill			1
titled " @entity24 , " the report is the third by the two senators targeting projects that they say fail to meet the job - creation goal of spending under the @entity23 of 2009			1
the report highlights the extraordinary " waste and mismanagement " of taxpayer dollars , said @entity12 , @entity29			1
the stimulus plan " was supposed to create jobs			1
" the " @entity35 people have awakened to the incompetency of @entity0 , " declared @entity11 , @entity33			0
" the rest of the federal government is filled with stuff just like this			0
" both senators conceded that the stimulus plan has had some positive effect on the economy , but insisted any benefit was due solely to the sheer size of the package , and that its effectiveness had been blunted due its poor design and spending choices			1
@entity11 complained the measure was full of projects that are " stupid or inappropriate , " and fail to meet " the common sense test			1
" the plan failed to give " us the biggest bang for our buck , " he asserted			0
the @entity23 , which was passed a few weeks after president @entity18 took office , was a government - funded effort to kick - start economic activity in response to the ongoing recession			1
it called for " shovel - ready " jobs -- from road and bridge repair and construction to scientific research and expanded broadband and wireless service -- through federal contracts , grants and loans , as well as helping state and local governments avoid layoffs and funding tax cuts			0
the senators ' report challenged the viability or effectiveness of specific projects across the country			1
however , the report 's use of selected information from hundreds of footnoted sources left it unclear if the brief summaries of each project told the whole story			1
in a previous report last january , the senators included the @entity93 as an example of wasteful stimulus spending without mentioning that the money was for a flood control project along the train 's route , rather than the train itself			1
the latest edition covered a broad range of projects including construction , research , development and conservation			2
topping the list was $ 554,763 spent for new windows at the @entity110 at @entity111 in @entity112			0
the @entity114 facility opened in 1993 at a cost of $ 11.5 million to provide visitors with panoramic views of the scenic volcano			0
however , it closed in 2007 due to staffing shortages , and now is getting the stimulus funds to replace its trademark windows in preparation for use for another purpose , according to information provided by the @entity114			2
" one government official likened it to ' keeping a vacant house in good repair , ' while another official noted that there is hope to find some purpose for the building in the future , whether as a hotel , science camp or restaurant , " the report said , attributing the information to a july 2009 article on tdn.com , a local news website			2
" despite those efforts , there are no plans to use the empty space			0
" the @entity114 information provided no timetable for the possible reopening of the visitors ' center for another purpose			0
" @entity155 is now reviewing several proposals for how the facility could be used in the future through a variety of public - private partnerships , including a science facility , education camp , or an overnight lodge , " the @entity114 document said			0
ranked second on the senators ' list was a @entity167 at @entity169 project that received $ 762,372 in stimulus finds to develop a computerized choreography program , the report said			1
quoting a july 6 story posted on the @entity169 - based news website @entity175 , the report said the project involves recording dancers on video , then logging and analyzing their movements			2
" this will allow choreographers to explore the interactive dance without always having a full cast of dancers present , " said the grant posted on the government 's stimulus bill website , recovery.gov			1
" the system will be extended into a @entity191 ' application that will allow the public to engage in interactive dance choreography , " the grant goes on to say			0
however , the senators ' report initially failed to state the money was spread over three years			1
again citing the @entity175 story , it also initially said lead researcher @entity206 " noted that her funding was severely restricted by the fact that the university is taking a 44 percent cut to cover ' overhead ' expenses			0
" in reality the website story said : " the money is spread over three years and @entity206 points out the university takes 44 percent overhead			0
" after the discrepancy was pointed out by @entity1 , the report was changed , an aide to @entity11 said			2
in an interview with @entity1 , @entity206 said the project fit the kind of research and development work called for by the @entity23			1
through its application and further development , it could lead to audiences having an impact on performance by registering their reaction through handheld audience response devices , @entity206 said			0
" we 'll need to develop a bunch of different software packages that never existed before , " she said , adding that project employs three students part - time over its three - year span and pays for dancers and other participants in what amounts to direct economic activity			0
" i think it 's sad that this research money that is really allowing innovation and funding students doing great research is being used as a political tool , " @entity206 said			0
then there is the project listed at no. 28 by the senators -- $ 71,623 to researchers at @entity245 to see how monkeys react under the effects of cocaine			2
titled " effect of @entity251 on @entity252 , " the project calls for monkeys to self - administer drugs while researchers monitor and study their glutamate levels , the report said			2
it cited a march 8 @entity257 article that quoted @entity259 spokesman @entity258 as saying the stimulus money would allow the university to continue a job that otherwise might have been cut			1
@entity263 , assistant vice president for media relations at @entity265 , said the grant will " have significant impact on public health in regards to cocaine addiction and the issue of relapse			0
" " it 's also important to note that the applications for these grants are peer reviewed and this study was deemed of merit by a panel of scientific experts , and then reviewed by the @entity281 on @entity282 before funds were awarded , " @entity263 said in a statement to @entity1			0
@entity284 , the @entity285 spokesperson for the @entity23 , called the senators ' report a partisan effort intended to undermine the overall success of the @entity23			1
according to @entity284 , new research shows stimulus money is responsible for nearly 3 million jobs and has lowered unemployment by 1.5 percent			2
" we 'll look into each of their claims and take action if any have merit , but with more than 70,000 @entity23 projects underway , any misguided project is just a small fraction of tens of thousands coast to coast that are rebuilding @entity35 and putting people to work , " @entity284 said			1
@entity285 press secretary @entity306 tuesday dismissed the @entity308 report as " political , " and said it lacked credibility			1
@entity1 's @entity311 contributed to this report			2

@entity12 says the report highlights " waste and mismanagement "
a new report by two @entity308 senators *criticizes* stimulus projects
the report says the cited projects fail to deliver what the @entity23 promised
the @entity285 responds that the bill is working as planned
