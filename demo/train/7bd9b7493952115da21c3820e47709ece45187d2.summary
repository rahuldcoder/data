-- more than 8,000 people have died in the violence surrounding the @entity6 uprising in the past year , a @entity2 official said tuesday			1
and a new @entity8 report released wednesday says @entity6 detained by the regime are subjected to systemic torture			1
dozens of women and children in @entity14 were some of the latest victims , killed in what activists describe as a massacre over the weekend			1
the victims were all stabbed to death and burned after " @entity6 forces and thugs " stormed their homes , according to a member of the @entity24			1
@entity6 president @entity26 's regime insists " armed terrorist groups " -- which it routinely blames for the violence -- were behind the killings in the @entity31 neighborhood			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in @entity6 because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists			1
@entity0 's @entity38 was able to recently report from inside @entity6 after she and a @entity0 crew were secretively taken into @entity14 with the help of local activists			1
what do the most recent reports of brutality mean for the future and will the violence only worsen ? @entity47 , now in @entity48 , explains : question : the latest attacks in @entity14 as described by the opposition are especially brutal -- have there been similar reports in the past and do you think these type of atrocities are getting worse ? @entity47 : the situation most certainly seems to be worsening			0
activists are warning of revenge killings and are warning that they will not be able to control the masses for much longer , which is one of the main reasons why they are calling for international intervention			1
there were two similar incidences in @entity31 in january , though neither was on this scale			0
q : what role does sectarian divides play in all this ? and is the violence expanding into other areas ? @entity47 : just about every @entity6 across the spectrum is very quick to declare that sectarianism does n't exist			1
that being said , they do admit to sectarian undertones to what is happening , especially in @entity14			1
the concern is that if the situation is n't resolved , these sectarian undertones could emerge which would be utterly devastating			2
in the recent attacks in the @entity31 neighborhood , the families were , according to the opposition , all @entity84			0
the neighborhood is actually a mixed neighbhorhood of @entity86 and @entity84			0
a few weeks ago , activists from @entity14 were telling us that the neighborhood had basically divided			2
there was one main road that moved through it , and all of the @entity86 families had moved to one side , the @entity84 families to another			0
[ @entity86 comprise a branch of @entity98 ; they are a minority in @entity6 with @entity84 being about 74 % of the population , according the @entity101			1
] and what 's incredibly difficult in all of this is really trying to independently verify what is taking place			2
but there is one thing that is undeniable , and that is that this horrific cycle of death continues			2
and many people are growing increasingly concerned about the underlying sectarian nature of this type of violence			2
if the situation is n't resolved , activists are warning that these types of massacres will be more widespread			2
q : what were things you kept hearing from the people there when you were in @entity6 ? what was the toll of living in this type of situation taking on the people , especially women and children ? @entity47 : it is wrecking the population physically , mentally , emotionally			1
there is hardly a person who has n't lost someone they know to violence or has been detained by the regime			0
children are traumatized by the violence			2
women are unable to protect their children and are left feeling helpless , vulnerable , frightened			1
the psychological impact is profound			0
( related : life and death under @entity6 's military onslaught ) q : @entity2 special envoy to @entity6 , @entity151 , recently left @entity6 after talking with @entity26 about proposals to end the bloodshed			1
@entity151 said he 's staying hopeful			2
what has been the reaction to this from activists ? @entity47 : it 's very difficult to gauge exactly where [ @entity151 's ] sense of optimism is coming from			1
a lot of activists , following those comments , were posting things to @entity166 like , " @entity151 is being blinded by his humanitarian blinders			0
" others saying that he quite simply was unable to see the truth , because the opposition firmly believes that the @entity26 regime has absolutely no intent of reforming			0
trying to bring about any sort of concrete plan that would result in that peace that everyone really does want -- that part most definitely is true -- is going to be incredibly difficult , because both sides are quite simply so polarized and so hardened against one another because of all of the bloodshed			0
the @entity26 government is saying that it is not going to relent in its pursuit of these terrorist armed gangs			0
the opposition is saying that it wo n't even entertain the notion of sitting at a negotiating table until some sort of cease - fire is implemented			0
and many members of the opposition wo n't even entertain the notion of negotiating with the @entity26 regime to begin with			0
they would have to see the president , his entourage removed from power before they will even begin to try to negotiate any sort of way forward			0
so it 's a very , very difficult situation			0
but both sides are warning that if some sort of resolution does not take place , the violence is only going to escalate to even more unimaginable heights .			0
