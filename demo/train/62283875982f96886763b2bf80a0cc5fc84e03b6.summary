-- trapped beneath a capsized raft on a churning river in northern @entity4 , @entity1 realized her body was " panicking , " but not her mind			2
" i was choking and gasping ... and the minute or so i was underwater felt like a lifetime , " says @entity1			2
yet , in the moments before she was pulled to safety , @entity1 also felt a sense of calm			2
" i remember thinking , ' i 'm probably going to die right now ... so this is how it 's going to happen '			0
" today , the @entity15 public relations account executive can speak calmly about her close encounter with death four years earlier			1
" the notion of dying seemed so simple at that moment , which was an interesting change from how complex life and its challenges usually can be , " says @entity1			1
yet not much has changed in her life since -- although she vows to never run river rapids again			0
while near - death experiences ( @entity26 ) were once thought to be rare , researchers now estimate that about a third of those who come close to death , or approximately 5 percent of the @entity29 population , experience an @entity26 , according to dr. @entity30 , professor of psychiatry and director of the @entity33 at the @entity34			1
in an article published in the journal @entity37 , @entity30 describes @entity38 as " profound psychological events with transcendental mystical elements typically occurring to individuals close to death or in situations of intense physical or emotional danger			1
" cause and effect what causes @entity38 remains unclear			0
dr. @entity47 , author of " what happens when we die , " thinks that @entity26 are hallucinations brought about by the brain shutting down , or a comforting psychological phenomenon summoned up by patients as death approaches			1
@entity47 bases this conclusion on his studies of patients who have been declared clinically dead ( usually considered the point at which cardiac function ceases ) and been brought back to life			0
other researchers have linked nde - type events to a wider variety of circumstances , including fainting , serious illness and the time just preceding a potentially catastrophic occurrence like a car accident			1
then there is dr. @entity71 , professor of neurology at the @entity73			0
his research has led to a theory that people who go through a near - death experience may be experiencing the " intrusion of the @entity79 ( rapid eye movement , when most dreams are believed to occur ) stage of sleep during a wakeful crisis			1
" @entity71 , who interviewed 55 people who underwent an @entity26 , found that in 60 percent of the cases , the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness were not as clearly delineated as they are in other people			0
" you can be awake and asleep simultaneously , " says @entity71			1
" in some people , it 's not an either - or situation			1
" the spiritual side for some , near - death experiences take on a spiritual significance that can be life - changing			1
whether you believe these moments have actually brought you closer to a higher power or are , instead , the result of some physiological reaction in the body , may depend on your background			0
" we do n't know much about these near - death experiences , " says dr. @entity105 , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences , and head of the @entity110 at @entity111			1
" from a physiological standpoint , it 's possible that ( the brain shutting down ) creates the sensation of the bright light and a tunnel , and that 's interpreted in terms of spiritual significance " it 's a common phenomenon ... but it 's hard to study because the experiences are n't subjective , you ca n't verify them , and they are self - reported , " @entity105 adds			1
most religious groups do n't have a position on near death experiences , explains @entity131 , ph.d. , chair of the @entity133 at the @entity134			2
" there is , for example , no official @entity138 position on near death experiences , " she says			2
" however , they are recognized as profoundly transformative in a spiritual sense			2
" " many people ... feel that by not dying , " says @entity131 , " that they have been spared for a purpose , and that their life is a special gift they must treasure			0
" that 's the case with @entity150 , a marketing professional from @entity151 , @entity152 , who plans to go back to school so she can better train her voice to " transform " her audiences through her singing			0
@entity150 's near - death experience occurred while hospitalized for a serious illness almost four years ago			1
" i felt like i was on a ladder coming up to the light and was filled with a feeling of surrendering to a ' presence , ' " says @entity150			2
" i felt like i was ready to leave , but i sensed a resistance			0
" @entity150 says she went into a " deep communion with her soul			0
" after four days , she remembers receiving a " message " that her life 's work was to use her talents -- @entity150 is a writer , artist , dancer , and singer -- for healing			0
" when i focus on using my voice for service , it is an arresting experience for me , " says @entity150			2
" this is what i was sent back here to do			0
without my near - death experience , i would n't have known this			1
