-- @entity2 , by necessity , has developed one of the most able security and intelligence apparatus in the world			1
there has been no necessity to develop a world - class political apparatus , however , and it shows			0
in a single week , the @entity2 army 's chief of staff , the former head of internal security and the former head of external security have all publicly questioned @entity2 prime minister @entity18 's judgment on @entity19			1
while the current army chief spoke narrowly about the @entity19 government , the former security officials directed their fire at @entity2 politicians			1
on friday , the former internal security chief told an @entity2 audience , " i do n't believe in a leadership that makes decisions based on messianic feelings " -- and he was speaking not of @entity19 , but of @entity2			1
last week was @entity2 's independence day , traditionally an occasion of pride and celebration			2
instead , @entity2 are in a deep funk			1
at its founding in 1948 , @entity2 seemed an improbable state			2
an ingathering of @entity38 from @entity39 , the @entity41 world and beyond had no real economy , no common language and no common idea of what it was to be an @entity2			2
tensions between religious @entity38 and secular jews , @entity49 @entity38 and @entity50 , and @entity38 and @entity41 simmered for decades			0
they made accommodations in the name of survival , but few conceded the fight for control of the state			0
to hear many @entity2 tell it now , their nation has become an impossible state			2
politics are more contentious than ever			0
the @entity2 welfare state is in full view , as the religious , the poor and the religious poor make increasing demands on the state			0
prices are skyrocketing , and the public feels squeezed			0
a diminishing number of @entity2 serve in the army , which once prided itself on universal conscription			0
although the old distinctions between @entity79 and @entity80 @entity38 have faded , many @entity50 continue to feel disenfranchised , the rising political prominence of recent immigrants from the @entity77 has created another tribe in @entity2 , and the poor and disempowered @entity82 yet one more			1
politics in @entity2 has always been a contact sport , but rather than battle to win over the center , an increasing number of political battles are conducted entirely on the fringes			1
small religious parties seek greater social spending for their constituents , while a party representing secular @entity94 @entity38 focuses on undermining a law exempting @entity96 @entity2 from military service			0
in election after election , the major parties ' share of the vote diminishes , leading to weak coalitions that are ideologically incoherent and that are forced to dole out @entity105 posts and largesse to their members to stay in power			0
governments become tentative and fragile			0
the problems call for decisiveness , but the politicians rarely feel they can afford to be			0
for @entity2 , @entity19 is an excruciating problem			1
they rely on intelligence that is never as good as they wish it to be , try to assess accurately actions of people they do n't know well and do so with potentially devastating consequences for a wrong move			0
@entity2 also debate @entity19 with a clarity few other countries can muster : if bombs fell on @entity2 , how many people have access to fallout shelters ? are the disastrous forest fires of 2010 a sign that @entity2 's disaster response is simply not up to the task of a military confrontation ? what would a military confrontation look like anyway , and could it be won ? @entity2 's last war against another state 's army was almost 40 years ago			1
its subsequent confrontations have had less clear results			0
the @entity2 political class struggles to consider these issues and more			1
should @entity2 do more to seek peace with the @entity142 ? can it reverse increasingly hostile relations with @entity144 ? is a wealth of recently discovered natural gas in the @entity147 the country 's economic salvation ? can @entity2 do anything about shifting politics in @entity152 and the rest of the @entity41 world that are sidelining pragmatists who sought an accommodation with @entity2 ? and more fundamentally , what is it to be a @entity38 state when @entity2 themselves can not agree on who is the arbiter of @entity163 ? none of these problems is especially new , but the political forces in @entity2 seem increasingly unable to confront them			1
@entity2 have traditionally sought political salvation from former generals			1
many of @entity2 's greatest political personalities , from @entity172 to @entity173 , came out of the military establishment			2
for more than a decade , former leaders on the security front have tried to step forward to consolidate @entity2 politics toward the middle			2
former gen. @entity179 formed the ill - fated @entity180 in 1999 , and @entity173 formed the centrist @entity181 in 2005			0
the security veterans ' recent critiques fit into the same pattern , and they may boost the political aspirations of newcomer @entity186 , whose background is in media rather than the battlefield			0
yet tactics communicated at high volume are not the same as strategy , and @entity2 increasingly complain that the former keep substituting for the latter			2
it is a sign of the vibrancy of @entity2 political life that authoritative voices can come out and critique government policy			2
it is a sign of the weakness of @entity2 politics that so many of @entity2 's same problems persist and so many coalitions remain fragile			1
for many outside of @entity2 , it is @entity2 's position on @entity19 that is truly consequential , and the rest is commentary			1
for @entity2 , the roiling debate on @entity19 is just another example of the way @entity2 politics work			1
@entity2 politics are not likely to change quickly , and the challenges @entity2 feel from @entity19 are not likely to go away quickly either			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity217 says @entity2 has strong security *system* , but its political *structure* is fragile
*ex-security* chiefs lambasted @entity18 on his *hawkish* @entity19 stance , causing an *uproar*
@entity215 : @entity2 are in a funk , with *dissension* high among *citizens* and political figures
coalitions getting weaker , unable to deal with *intractable* problems such as @entity19 , he says
