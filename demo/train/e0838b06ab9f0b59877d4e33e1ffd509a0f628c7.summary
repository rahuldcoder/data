@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 blogger @entity3 has become a household name in the @entity6 and sparked a global uproar after a friend posted a photo of her naked on @entity10			1
the photo , which the 20 - year - old former student first posted on her blog , shows her naked apart from a pair of thigh - high stockings and some red patent leather shoes			2
it was later posted on @entity10 with the hashtag # nudephotorevolutionary			0
the tweet was viewed over a million times , while @entity3 's followers jumped from a few hundred to more than 14,000			1
her actions have received global media coverage and provoked outrage in @entity0 , a conservative @entity26 country where most women wear the veil			1
many liberals fear that @entity3 's actions will hurt their prospects in the parliamentary election next week			1
@entity3 describes herself as an atheist			1
she has been living for the past five months with her boyfriend , blogger @entity34 , who , in 2006 was sentenced to four years in a maximum security prison for criticizing @entity36 and defaming former president @entity37			2
here she talks exclusively to @entity2 in @entity1 about why she posed nude			1
@entity2 : why did you post a photo of yourself nude photo on @entity10 , and why the red high heels and black stockings ? @entity43 : after my photo was removed from @entity46 , a male friend of mine asked me if he may post it on @entity10			1
i accepted because i am not shy of being a woman in a society where women are nothing but sex objects harassed on a daily basis by men who know nothing about sex or the importance of a woman			2
the photo is an expression of my being and i see the human body as the best artistic representation of that			0
i took the photo myself using a timer on my personal camera			0
the powerful colors black and red inspire me			0
@entity2 : who is @entity70 inside the body portrayed in the nude photo ? @entity43 : i like being different			1
i love life , art , photography and expressing my thoughts through writing more than anything			0
that is why i studied media and hope to take it further to the tv world too so i can expose the truth behind the lies we endure everyday in this world			0
i do n't believe that we must have children only through marriage			0
it 's all about love			0
@entity2 : how have your @entity4 @entity26 parents reacted ? how do they feel about you living with your boyfriend unmarried ? @entity43 : i last spoke to them 24 days back			1
they want to support me and get closer , especially after the photo was released , but they accuse @entity34 of manipulating me			2
he has been my support system and has passed along their text messages to me			2
i dropped out of @entity101 ( @entity101 where she was a media student ) months back after ( my parents ) attempted to control my life by threatening not to pay the fees			2
@entity2 : the press has labeled you a revolutionary but you were not in @entity109 during the 18 days of the revolution in february this year			1
is there a political element to you posing nude ? @entity43 : i was never into politics			0
i first joined the protests on may 27th because i felt the need to participate and decided i might be able to change the future of @entity0 and refused to remain silent			1
i made it clear that i was not part of april 6th movement ( an @entity4 political group that came to prominence during the revolution ) after the rumors were spread by remnants of @entity37 's @entity124 who wanted to capitalize on the reaction to the photo			1
what shocked me is april 6th 's statement clarifying that @entity3 is not part of their organization and how they do n't accept " atheism			1
" where is the democracy and liberalism they preach to the world ? they only feed what the public wants to hear for their political ambitions			0
@entity2 : what do you think about the forced virginity tests performed by the @entity4 military on more than a dozen girls arrested in @entity109 ? @entity43 : i consider this rape			1
those men in the military who conducted these tests should be punished for allowing this to happen without the consent of the girls in the first place			0
instead , the girls walk around feeling the shame and most of them are forced to remain silent			0
@entity2 : do you practice safe sex in your sexual revolution ? @entity43 : most @entity4 are secretive about sex because they are brought up thinking sex is something bad and dirty and there is no mention of it in schools			1
sex to the majority is simply a man using a woman with no communication between them and children are just part of an equation			2
to me , sex is an expression of respect , a passion for love that culminates into sex to please both sides			0
i do practice safe sex but i do n't take pills because i am against abortion			0
i enjoyed losing my virginity at the age of 18 with a man i loved who was 40 years older than me			0
@entity34 is the second man and the love of my life			0
the saying suits us : " birds of the same feather flock together " @entity2 : how do you see women in the " @entity0 " and will you leave the country if the ongoing revolution fails ? @entity43 : i am not positive at all unless a social revolution erupts			1
women under @entity36 will always be objects to use at home			0
the ( sexism ) against women in @entity0 is unreal , but i am not going anywhere and will battle it ' til the end			1
many women wear the veil just to escape the harassment and be able to walk the streets			2
i hate how society labels gays and lesbians as abnormal people			0
different is not abnormal ! @entity2 : what are your future plans with @entity34 and will you find it hard to deal with your new notoriety ? @entity43 : i have discovered who my real friends are , and i have @entity34 who loves me passionately			2
he works as a media monitor and i am currently looking for a job			0
i embrace the simple things in life and i am a vegetarian ... i am a believer of every word i say and i am willing to live in danger under the many threats i receive in order to obtain the real freedom all @entity4 are fighting and dying for daily .			1

@entity238 : @entity4 blogger @entity3 tells @entity2 why she posed naked
@entity240 says she posed naked because she is not *afraid* of being a woman despite harassment in @entity0
she says her @entity26 parents want to support her ; her father always hated the way she dressed
@entity240 : i am a believer of every word i say and i am willing to live in danger under the many threats i receive
