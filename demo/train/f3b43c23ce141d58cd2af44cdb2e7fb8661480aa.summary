how safe is your carry - on bag ? what 's a flier to do ? @entity0 asked some consumer air travel experts for their advice for avoiding any conflict with the flight attendants who are ( mostly ) trying to get you to your destination			1
before trouble starts , here are their suggestions for making your journey smoother			0
try starting your boarding process by saying " good morning " or " @entity64 " as you would your co-worker or your child 's teacher -- and you might stand out as a courteous traveler			1
flight attendants deal with every personality under the sun , and not everyone is polite to them			1

" right away , they say ' thank you so much , ' " he said			0
" most of them are very appreciative because no one is nice to these guys			0
" it 's easy , " says consumer blogger @entity84			0
" you keep your head down and do exactly what the flight attendants say without questioning them			1
" that means putting your carry - on bags away , sitting down , buckling up and turning off your electronic devices , maybe even before anyone says so			0
if they do n't have to worry about you , they will pay attention to others			0
boarding is not the time to argue your hypothesis about cell phone interference with an airplane 's navigation equipment			2
wait till your @entity105 - enabled plane reaches 10,000 feet to write e-mails to the @entity107 or the @entity108 , which make the rules about electronics on flights			1

" shower before you board , try not to have any special needs , like luggage that needs to be lifted into the overhead compartments , and do n't fly with a screaming baby or fidgety toddler			2
all of those things can be grounds for getting removed from a flight before takeoff , " says @entity84			2
" but mostly , do n't give your flight attendants any lip			1
" educate your children in advance			2
whether your child is 5 or 15 , parents need to prepare them for the rules they have to follow while at an airport or on an airplane			1
it 's good for younger children to practice clearing security , buckling their seat belts , turning off their electronics and tucking their things under the seat in front of them			1
if they do it as soon as they board the aircraft , no flight attendant will see them as potential rule violators			1
how do you stay out of trouble and ensure a good ride on an airplane ? please share your thoughts in the comments section below .			1

greet flight attendants politely with a " good morning " or " @entity64 "
put away your gear , buckle up and stow your electronics *quickly*
train your children about the rules of flight before they board an airplane
