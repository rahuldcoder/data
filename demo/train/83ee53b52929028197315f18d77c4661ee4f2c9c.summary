-- the credible but as yet unconfirmed reports that three men directed by @entity3 have plans for an attack on the @entity6 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of september 11 reminds us of the persistence of the threat from @entity12 terrorists			1
yet our research indicates that @entity3 and those motivated by its ideology are not the only sources of terrorism that the country faces and that terrorists across the ideological spectrum from those motivated by @entity23 's ideology to neo-nazis have managed to kill only 30 people in the @entity6 since the attacks on @entity27 and @entity28 a decade ago			1
while each of those deaths is , or course , a tragedy , it is orders of magnitude smaller than the 15,000 @entity6 who are murdered every year			2
our study also found that @entity12 terrorism has been no more deadly in the @entity6 than other forms of domestic terrorism since september 11			1
in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks , one of the fears of ordinary citizens and terrorism experts alike was that a new wave of terrorists would strike , some of them armed with chemical , biological , radiological or even nuclear materials			1
ten years later , we have yet to see an @entity12 terrorist incident involving such weapons in the @entity6 , and no @entity12 militant in this country has made a documented attempt to even acquire such devices			1
yet this is not the case for other terrorists			2
indeed , the record of the past decade suggests that if a chemical , biological or radiological attack were to take place in the @entity6 , it is more likely that it would come not from a @entity12 terrorist but from a right - wing extremist or anarchist			1
in partnership with @entity71 's @entity70 , the @entity72 has conducted a survey of terrorism incidents and cases in the @entity6 since september 11 motivated by political ideologies other than the violent @entity12 advocated by @entity23			1
those ideologies span the spectrum from neo-nazism and militant @entity81 fundamentalism to anarchism and violent environmentalism			0
in the 114 cases we examined , we found five instances of the successful or attempted development or purchase of biological , chemical or radiological weapons by violent extremists motivated by ideologies that have no relation to @entity3 : @entity96 , a right - wing militia activist , together with his common - law wife , @entity94 , had stored enough chemicals to produce a quantity of hydrogen cyanide gas that could kill thousands , along with more than 100 weapons , nearly 100,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 100 pounds of explosives			1
they were arrested in 2003			0
@entity96 was eventually sentenced to more than 11 years in prison , while @entity94 received nearly five years			0
anarchist and self - proclaimed " @entity109 " @entity107 was stockpiling dangerous chemicals , including sodium cyanide , when he was arrested by @entity113 police in 2002			0
he is currently serving a 13 - year sentence			0
microbiologist @entity115 , an @entity117 investigation concluded , sent waves of panic throughout the country and killed five people when he sent letters filled with anthrax to politicians and journalists during fall 2001			0
@entity115 committed suicide in 2008			0
( some reports have cast doubt on @entity115 ' responsibility for the attacks , but the @entity117 remains firm in its conclusion that @entity115 was responsible , based on the scientific and other evidence			0
) white supremacist @entity133 was arrested in 2004 after trying to purchase sarin nerve gas and c - 4 explosive from an undercover government agent			0
his efforts to obtain the weapons earned him a 30 - year prison sentence			2
another white supremacist , @entity140 , managed to acquire a supply of radiological materials from scientific research companies and may have been planning to build a " dirty " radiological bomb when his wife killed him after years of domestic abuse in 2008			2
to be clear , the 114 cases of right - wing and left - wing terrorism we examined probably do not represent a complete survey of @entity153 terrorist cases in the @entity6 since september 11			1
while some of this case information is available from the @entity117 , as well as organizations that track right - wing radicalism such as the @entity158 , keeping track of these incidents is far more difficult than tracking incidents of @entity12 terrorism			1
that is because unlike @entity12 terror cases , which are nearly all tried under anti-terrorism laws or statutes dealing with " material support " to terrorist groups , other domestic terrorism cases are often tried under an array of other statutes , from weapons and explosives violations , property destruction and arson to " seditious conspiracy " in the case of the anti-government @entity179 militia in @entity180			1
research on the subject is also hampered by the fact that many of these cases received only limited media attention , unlike the now 188 cases of @entity12 terrorism that the @entity72 and @entity71 's @entity70 have found in the @entity6 since september 11			1
we sought to impose as clear a standard as we could for politically motivated violence across a broad spectrum of cases , ranging from environmental terrorism to white supremacist terrorism			2
we were careful to exclude cases in which insanity or mental deficiency may have had a significant impact , such as that of @entity200 , who is accused of killing six people and seriously wounding rep. @entity202 in @entity203 in january			0
we also excluded cases of violence that appear not to have been premeditated , such as when @entity205 and his son @entity206 , both steeped in anti-government ideology and armed with an assault rifle , killed two @entity211 police during a traffic stop in 2010 before they were shot dead themselves in an ensuing car chase			0
on the other hand , we did include cases in which there was no defined plot but the individual involved had both extreme political views and had bought or constructed high - explosives and other offensive weapons			2
officials said that was the case with @entity224 , a neo-nazi and border vigilante who was arrested this year in @entity203 with a dozen powerful homemade grenades			0
as in @entity12 terrorism cases in the @entity6 , right - and left - wing terrorists were not all young hotheads but instead had an average age of 36			1
but unlike the @entity12 terrorism cases , which involved only 4 % females , in other cases of domestic terrorism women were involved in 15 percent of the cases			1
the right - and left - wing terrorists in our dataset are almost entirely native - born @entity6 citizens , and nearly all appear to be @entity241			1
but the political motivations behind their acts were diverse in ways that the participants themselves were not			0
thirty - seven percent of cases involved anti-government extremism ; 23 % were motivated by environmental or pro-animal rights extremism ; 17 % involved white supremacist ideas or bias against particular ethnic groups ; and 11 % of cases were animated by religious bias or were acts committed on the basis of religious beliefs , including attacks against abortion doctors and providers			0
at least fourteen people have been killed in right - and left - wing terrorism - related incidents over the past decade , while acts inspired by @entity12 militant ideas killed 17 people ( 13 of them at @entity266 , @entity267 , in 2009 )			2
the number of @entity270 incidents that caused fatalities ( eight ) was also twice that of the @entity12 cases ( four )			2
and while in the @entity12 terrorism cases firearms and explosives figured into around a third of the cases , more than half the cases of @entity153 terrorism involved firearms or explosives			1
right - and left - wing terrorist incidents involved a broad array of targets ; a third focused on government buildings or institutions ; and 9 % targeted police			0
five percent of cases involved acts committed against abortion doctors or women 's health clinics , and 11 % targeted religious institutions : churches , mosques and synagogues			0
another 16 % of plots and attacks , many of them carried out by environmental extremists , targeted businesses or corporations			0
there was also a slightly greater number of government informants and undercover agents in the right - and left - wing terrorism cases , relative to the @entity12 terrorism cases			1
more than half of the right - and left - wing terrorism cases involved an informant or cooperating witness , and nearly 40 % of those cases also involved an undercover government agent			2
by contrast , in our survey of @entity12 terrorism cases , a third involved an informant , while 11 % involved a government agent ( six cases involved both a government agent and an informant )			1
and in 18 % of right - and left - wing terrorism cases -- compared with 22 % in @entity12 terrorism cases -- authorities were tipped off or assisted by family members or people within the same social or religious communities as the arrested individual			1
the data indicate that federal and local authorities are just as aggressive in their use of informants and undercover agents with right - and left - wing terrorists as they are with @entity337 extremists			0
and @entity337 and @entity338 alike are just as likely to cooperate with authorities when they see extremist acts going on , contrary to well - publicized claims from the head of the @entity342 , rep. @entity343 , that @entity345 involvement in disrupting terrorism plots is uncommonly low			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

recent terror alert renews concern about @entity3 , authors say
their study shows domestic terrorism often comes from @entity153 sources
*non-islamist* terrorists have been more likely to seek *unconventional* weapons , they say
authors : in @entity6 , @entity12 terrorism no more deadly than other forms since 9/11
