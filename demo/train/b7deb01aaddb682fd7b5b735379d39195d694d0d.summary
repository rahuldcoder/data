@entity0 -- it would be a mistake to write off threats of war against @entity6 from @entity8 prime minister @entity7 as mere bluster , assuming that @entity8 will maintain the status quo in valuing its relationship with the @entity12 on one hand , while resisting @entity15 's hegemonic ambitions on the other			1
the recent cross-border confrontation could ignite regional convulsions as @entity8 is sucked into @entity6 , leading to belated actions on the part of the international community			1
the @entity23 regime knows its time is limited as the rate of military and intelligence officers defecting to @entity28 and @entity8 increases in momentum			1
rebel attacks are inching closer to the heart of the @entity23 regime , such as the recent attack on the @entity6 air force intelligence compound in the @entity36 suburb of @entity37			1
this contributes to the regime 's recklessness in firing upon @entity8 with impunity			1
@entity42 may also be emboldened by the fact that @entity15 , a key @entity23 ally , could be limited in its ability to intervene due to its economic woes at home			0
this week its currency -- the rial -- plummeted in value due to a combination of sanctions and @entity54 's own mismanagement of the economy			0
@entity8 has less to lose by responding to @entity6 aggression -- this rationale is supported by recent reports that @entity15 has withdrawn from @entity6 275 members from a special operations unit attached to its elite @entity61			1
the conflict in @entity6 is no longer considered a purely internal matter			0
it clearly has regional ramifications			0
thus i believe @entity8 's aim to secure its border is inextricably linked with regime change			1
its increased military operations may stem from a calculus that it would accelerate the @entity23 regime 's demise			2
the @entity8 parliament 's assent for its troops to conduct operations inside @entity6 is not merely a symbolic attempt to bolster @entity8 pride while responding to domestic political pressure over the @entity6 attacks			1
it gives its armed forces the ability to do more than defend its borders			0
it is also likely that @entity88 may assist @entity8 -- a member state -- with the defense of its 560 - mile border , creating a de facto humanitarian buffer zone , where the @entity6 opposition could have a command post			1
however , this risks escalating the conflict into a @entity88 - led mission outside the framework of the @entity97 -- the kind of interventionist measure @entity100 and @entity101 would oppose as they did in @entity103			0
the shift towards conflict with @entity6 is characterized by the kind of strategic shift in the region that we 've seen before with @entity8			1
@entity7 was initially reluctant to impose sanctions on @entity15 and is now embracing @entity112 sanctions on @entity54			0
the @entity8 premier was also supportive of @entity15 's nuclear ambitions all the while seeking to downgrade relations with @entity54 's nemesis , @entity118			2
now it is aligning itself with the @entity121 bloc , including @entity122 and @entity28 against @entity15 and its @entity6 proxy			0
this could prompt an @entity15 military response and in turn instigate another spike in oil prices			0
the longer the @entity6 civil war continues , the greater the prospect of regional sectarian tensions emerging along @entity121 - @entity133 fault - lines			2
this could result in a @entity135 between regional powerhouses @entity136 , with its mainly @entity121 population , and the @entity133 - dominated @entity15			0
meanwhile , the @entity141 administration 's apparent strategy of " leading from behind " is an excuse for its dithering over the @entity6 humanitarian crisis			2
similarly , the @entity147 ' inaction over the crisis results from a deadlock at the @entity97 , with @entity101 and @entity100 opposed to any intervention -- implausibly advocating that the rebels conduct dialogue with a murderous regime			0
yet with the @entity147 's extensive history of paying lip service to upholding the values of human rights while ignoring genocide in @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 , its dismissive manner towards the current massacres taking place on a daily basis in @entity6 should come as no surprise			2
there are estimates that up to 50,000 people have been killed , with up to two million people internally displaced since the conflict started			0
the @entity147 claims that 300,000 @entity6 have fled the country			0
the @entity12 , realistically the only nation with the necessary military and logistical capability , could easily have prevented the refugee crisis that has heightened the prospect of conflict with @entity8			1
its wariness to arm rebels was to prevent blowback from the @entity182 and other empowered islamists in @entity6			0
yet the protracted conflict there has generated a kaleidoscopic civil - war and vacuum of governance across much of @entity6 that has attracted @entity183 , and even revived @entity189 , enabling it to infiltrate the ranks of the opposition and gain support in the wake of its attacks on @entity6 military and government installations			1
the @entity12 and its @entity88 allies could also have prevented much bloodshed by using air power to target the @entity23 regime 's military apparatus			1
@entity6 's military concentrated in @entity36 , @entity204 and northern @entity206 province are strained and would be overstretched if forced to respond to external military pressure			1
yet @entity208 and its @entity88 allies could now be forced to place a significant number of troops on the ground to prevent the proliferation of @entity6 's stockpile of chemical and biological weapons			1
the @entity141 administration has resigned itself to wishful thinking assuming , as defense secretary @entity218 has done , that @entity6 security forces could be held together to secure chemical weapons sites in the wake of the toppling of the @entity23 regime			2
in a vacuum of governance dominated by @entity183 , this may become a proliferation nightmare			0
while the @entity12 is keen on winding down its involvement in the @entity229 to refocus its attention on @entity231 , @entity6 may be the instigator that sucks it back into the region for another decade to manage a second @entity135			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			0
