-- what 's the best source of information for anyone planning a move overseas -- the @entity6 , the bookstore or those carefully worded government travel warnings ? duh ! it 's the movies , of course			1
why would anyone do any research when everything they need to know about their new lives has been laid bare on the silver screen ? when cinema gets it right , it does a pretty good job of taking a hatchet to the expat dream of lounging around in exotic bars dressed in linen suits and @entity29 hats			1
just as often , however , @entity31 's overseas adventures run into so much trouble it 's a wonder it is n't now languishing in the bowels of a dank foreign prison hoping that someone at the embassy might be able to put in a few calls			1
to help navigate the celluloid jungle , here 's our purely subjective list of the best and worst expat movies			1
' @entity45 ' ( 1953 ) this brutal piece of black and white @entity48 cinema reeks of unwashed vests , but its depiction of nasty expat truck drivers worthlessly risking their grubby lives in the @entity54 jungle is as explosive as the deadly nitroglycerine cargoes they 're paid to deliver			1
everyone is detestable , everyone dies and not even the dogs care			1
that 's how expat life should be			2
enlightening expat dialog @entity67 : " when i was a kid , i used to see men go off on these kinds of jobs ... and not come back			2
' @entity68 ' ( 1971 ) " @entity70 " director @entity69 takes a double - barrel shotgun to all those smug , honey - hued films about rural expat life in this tale about repressed @entity54 mathematician @entity75 ( @entity76 ) relocating to his wife 's @entity78 village			2
there are no hilarious misunderstandings with local plumbers , just thugs on tricycles			2
there 's no sun - kissed romance , just a marriage disintegrating into domestic violence			2
and there are no life - affirming friendships , just a cat getting throttled			2
the film 's brutality is a bit hard to stomach			2
the apparent need for a 2011 remake starring @entity97 was also somewhat hard to stomach			2
enlightening expat dialog @entity100 : " i do n't know my way home			1
" @entity75 : " that 's ok			2
' @entity104 ' ( 1949 ) expats do n't come colder than @entity106 ' elusive @entity104 , whose classic cuckoo clock speech justifying his racketeering in bombed - to - bits @entity109 sounds suspiciously like the kind of cruel logic deployed by corporate stooges when plundering developing world countries in return for a fat salary			1
( " free of income tax , old man			1
" ) if only real life saw these amoral exploiters hounded down , like @entity121 , in a subterranean sewer			2
if only real life was soundtracked by zithers			2
enlightening expat dialog @entity104 : " nobody thinks in terms of human beings			2
why should we ? " 2			2
' @entity130 ' ( 1982 ) with its eclectic if somewhat dated soundtrack and expansive mysticism of @entity134 's diminutive paparazzo , " @entity145 " emerges as an anti-expat classic , contrasting the seedy and sequestered lives of foreign hacks and diplomats in @entity140 - era @entity139 against the poverty and chaos of a country on the brink			1
all that plus a pre-rant @entity146			0
enlightening expat dialog @entity148 : " @entity149 is like a wavering flame that needs care to burn high			0
without such care she could lapse into the promiscuity and bitterness of the failed romantic			0
' @entity156 ' ( 1942 ) the closing scenes may not have the tear - jerking impact they once did , but if there 's a film in existence responsible for dampening as much @entity163 as " @entity156 , " it 's probably porn			1
this film portrays expat life as it should be : outwitting mendacious cops and ruthless nazis in the smoky haze of a @entity170 piano bar while risking everything in the name of unrequitable love			1
not playing golf for pity 's sake			0
who has n't imagined themselves plunged into @entity156 's wartime plot of double - dealing and heartbreak ? perhaps as @entity183 , at his craggy best as jaded saloon owner @entity181 ; @entity185 's impossibly lovely @entity184 ; or even @entity189 ' complicated @entity48 police chief captain @entity186			1
sure the dialog has been quoted to death , and if @entity69 or anyone else plays " @entity200 " again , they 're going to get the piano lid slammed on their fingers , but every fresh screening of @entity156 is still like the beginning of a beautiful friendship			1
enlightening expat dialog @entity204 ( on the verge of tears ) : " i did n't count the days			1
" @entity181 : " well , i did			0
every one of ' em. mostly i remember the last one			0
a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look in his face because his insides have been kicked out			0
" worst expat movies 5			0
' @entity219 ' ( 2000 ) with its gorgeous @entity221 scenery and rumbling undercurrents of violence , jealousy and death , " @entity219 " aims to deliver a serious message about the illusory nature of paradise , but does n't			1
it 's hard to say which is less credible , a bunch of backpacking muppets building a community on a hidden beach without an internet cafe or @entity235 ( as @entity236 ) joining them and failing to get the @entity48 girl			0
excruciating expat dialog @entity236 : " i just feel like everyone tries to do something different , but you always wind up doing the same damn thing			0
' under the @entity245 ' ( 2003 ) unlucky - in - love @entity54 writer @entity246 ( as @entity247 ) happens upon the only villa in @entity249 that is n't being rented out by middle class vacationers from @entity251 and buys it on a whim			1
in restoring the villa , she restores her own ... blah , blah , blah , whatever			0
so what 's the message here ? do n't worry if your marriage collapses , just buy a house in @entity261 , spend a bundle renovating it , then someone else will come along			1
there 's a life lesson we can all relate to			0
excruciating expat dialog frances : " i 'll hire the muscular descendants of @entity272 gods to do the heavy lifting			0
' @entity274 ' ( 2010 ) unlucky - in - love @entity54 writer @entity275 ... no , stick with us , this one 's slightly different			0
granted , @entity275 as @entity278 goes to @entity261 , but there 's no villa , just the start of a year swanning around the world with no apparent worries about cash			0
in @entity261 , @entity275 ' character learns to eat @entity261 food ( without gaining weight )			0
she then moves to @entity288 to explore spirituality before traveling to @entity290 for love			0
not love with some vacationing sleazeball			0
like that happens in real life			0
excruciating expat dialog @entity278 : " it wo n't last forever			1
" ( except this film -- 140 minutes long ! ) 2			1
' mr. baseball ' ( 1992 ) who needs jokes in your script when you 've got foreigners ? simply send grumpy aging baseball star @entity306 ( @entity307 ) to @entity308 , where hilarity ensues as he grapples with their crazy cultural traditions -- and toilets ! what should be a feelgood film about a fading star 's last dash for glory winds up being a feel - queasy trot through every @entity308 cliche known to @entity31			1
unsurprisingly , @entity321 ' new @entity308 owners were unhappy at the time			0
the film does have some good performances , but not from @entity307 , who was upstaged by his mustache , and not for the last time			0
excruciating expat dialog @entity306 : " different language , same attitude ! let 's go ! " 1			0
' @entity329 ' ( 1989 ) expats , eh ? always acting so damn entitled			1
but if you think they 're annoying where you live , spare a thought for the tribe in @entity336 , which winds up with @entity337 ( @entity338 ) in the midst of @entity340 not content to loudly drink his own body weight in alcohol every friday like normal , decent expats , @entity338 becomes their king -- a role that involves going topless and sporting @entity348 's blond bouffant			1
@entity338 cranks the ham dial up to 11 in this poor man 's " @entity350 , " taking on @entity308 invaders to protect his tribe which , despite being peopled with fearless headhunters , would apparently have been lost without a middle aged white guy there to save the day			1
excruciating expat dialogue @entity337 : " i have a special relationship with the spirits			0
i had to give up everything , even the will to live			0

cinema loves portraying the lives of expats -- but does n't always get it right
in " @entity156 " @entity183 plays a noble bar owner *toughing* out in @entity340
in " @entity329 " @entity338 plays a *shirtless* man with *feathers* in his hair
