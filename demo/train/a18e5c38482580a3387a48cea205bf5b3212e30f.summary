some members of the @entity2 may be resisting proposed new sanctions on @entity4 , but their opposition does n't seem likely to stop @entity2 passing legislation on @entity8 's nuclear program by the end of march			1
as one of the negotiators who sat across the table from the @entity4 for the past 15 months , though , i can assure you that legislation at this juncture risks undermining a deal that is clearly in the interest of all parties			1
fortunately , there now seems to be broad consensus that introducing more sanctions with immediate effect would simply play into the hands of @entity4 hard - liners			1
with that in mind , ideas for moving legislation have turned to focus on two concepts : establishing a " trigger " for new sanctions , linked either to an arbitrary future date or a collapse in the talks , and defining what would constitute a good deal and requiring an " up or down " vote on it			1
but as attractive as these concepts might appear , movement of such legislation still risks sparking an escalatory cycle that the talks neither need nor can handle			1
indeed , @entity4 's parliament has already demonstrated the risk of raising the stakes now			2
in a step that directly mirrors the @entity50 's decision on january 29 to bring to the @entity50 floor a " trigger " sanctions bill , @entity4 lawmakers moved forward a bill of their own that would require the termination of all compliance with the @entity58 , or @entity59 , if new @entity61 sanctions were approved or imposed			1
should talks collapse , there is common understanding that the @entity59 would fall apart and the status quo approach would return			0
but , through their separate actions , legislators on both sides guarantee it			0
to justify such a risk , proponents of new @entity61 legislation often suggest that there are doubts internationally that sanctions will be expanded significantly should talks fail			2
however , there is scant evidence to support this supposition and much to suggest otherwise			0
for a start , sanctions enforcement has continued apace during the @entity59 , which was originally agreed in november 2013			0
nearly o100 entities and individuals have been sanctioned , and there are daily efforts by @entity61 personnel to investigate cases and work with foreign partners on enforcement			0
second , although businesses are showing new interest in @entity4 , no new commercial deals have emerged			2
i have discussed this issue with companies and banks , and they have relayed that they are waiting to see whether a final deal can be reached before plunging back into @entity4 because it was expensive and complicated to get out in the first place , and because many underlying risks remain present			1
the fact is that they wo n't go back until they know how the talks will turn out			0
other critics focus on the quality of the deal being negotiated and want @entity2 to have a say			2
and as a negotiator , i spent almost as much time with members of @entity2 over the past 15 months as i did with @entity4 and the @entity112			1
as a result , i was acutely aware of congressional views and ensured that they directly affected the policy options we pursued in the talks			0
congressional concerns were raised at the negotiating table not only by @entity61 negotiators , but by fellow members of the @entity112 , and even by the @entity4			2
@entity2 is very much present in these negotiations			2
it is also important to remember that the disadvantages of defining a deal explicitly in law outweigh the theoretical negotiating advantages			0
if the point is to prevent a bad deal from being implemented by the @entity61 , then @entity2 has less provocative ways to do so while talks are ongoing , including by refusing to fund the implementation of such a deal once reached			2
if the point is to create red lines for the @entity4 negotiators , then @entity2 will have the opposite of its desired effect : defining a " good deal " in detail forces @entity4 negotiators to cross our red lines to maintain their revolutionary credentials and sell a deal at home			1
indeed , i have seen first - hand how @entity4 tends to reject any @entity112 idea that is leaked , because , if accepted , then @entity4 would be forced to admit a concession			0
negotiating in private , with @entity61 and @entity4 requirements neutrally described in public , avoids this morass			0
all this suggests that the push for legislation now hinges on the claim that @entity61 strength needs to be reasserted			0
this is staggering to me			0
if nothing else , our sanctions efforts against @entity4 -- of which i was a leading architect since 2006 -- demonstrate the strength and reach of @entity61 power , if judiciously applied			1
the @entity4 government will have to make real concessions to correct the damage sanctions have done to its economy -- it is not the @entity61 that needs to shore up its position and we should act accordingly			1
ironically , the one thing that could imperil our leadership abroad would be to undermine the talks at home			0
and legislation can have other negative effects : a slightly noticed part of the @entity4 bill would require all sanctions to be terminated before a comprehensive arrangement could be implemented			1
if this became law , then @entity4 negotiators would be powerless to allow the phased reduction of sanctions in response to @entity4 taking specific nuclear steps , a key element of the @entity112 approach			1
ultimately , there is a role for @entity2 to play , but lawmakers should fulfill their oversight role without being unnecessarily prescriptive and , having set expectations for negotiators already , should leave the exact contours of a deal to our scientists , experts and diplomats			0
@entity2 should not harm its own cause by legislating on @entity4 now .			1
