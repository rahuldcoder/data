-- they carry a bag for a living but these men can bring home six - figure incomes			1
they often spend more time with their bosses than their wives , and their working " marriages " can end in a messy divorce			0
welcome to the world of a caddy -- the golf world 's unsung heroes			1
at the top of the pile is @entity17 , arguably the one superstar caddy in global golf , a bag man who has earned well in excess of most professionals thanks predominantly to his past partnership with @entity22			1
his wealth is estimated at $ 20 million and he was once @entity24 's highest - paid sportsman			1
it has been enough to pursue his other , admittedly expensive , sporting passion of saloon - car racing with his own team , appropriately titled @entity29			2
he also founded his own racing series , which he funds , and does about 25 events a year			1
but how has he merited such big bucks ? well , 36 years into his career he has overseen 150 tournament wins -- more than any other caddy in golf history			1
now working for defending @entity37 champion @entity37 , @entity17 argues that key to his job is the ability to understand people			1
" you can teach someone to do the yardage and read the course but being a good caddy , it 's not easy to explain , " says the 50 - year - old , who previously worked for major champions @entity44 and @entity45			1
" it 's almost like you have to stand in a player 's shoes , see what they 're seeing and feel what they 're feeling , to be them			2
" before @entity17 , caddies were very much behind the scenes -- but no longer			1
when with @entity22 , he described his arch rival @entity63 as a " pr * * * " and he was castigated for a racist barb against his former employer some time after the 14 - time major champion had fired him			1
and then there was his over-the - top celebration and interview when @entity37 won the pair 's first tournament together			1
other caddies have been the subject of controversy too			2
en route to @entity78 's victory at the @entity79 last weekend -- where @entity37 and @entity17 blew a winning position on the final day -- the @entity82 's caddy @entity81 was caught on camera shouting " f * * * ing lay - up " after a particular shot			1
@entity17 clams up when asked about his relationship with @entity22 but he will always be known for his time with the world no. 1 -- hardly surprising given the @entity82 won 13 of his 14 major wins with the @entity90 in tow			1
" you almost have to teach yourself the psychology side of things , " explains @entity17 , who is extremely affable in conversation			1
" i think i 'm a good reader of people -- you have to be able to observe people over a long period of time			0
" you need to see how they cope under pressure and you have to see them at both their best and worst to see how they tick			0
" in caddying terms , @entity17 is something of an anomaly			1
most admit to stumbling into the job , but for @entity17 it was different			1
while friends at his stunning local course -- @entity112 -- dreamed of being the next @entity113 , the five - time @entity114 winner from @entity115 , the teenage @entity17 merely wanted to caddy for him ... and got his chance , the first time he ever carried the bag			1
now , with potential retirement looming , @entity17 plans to either give up altogether at the end of this season or else do the job part - time so he can spend more time with his eight - year - old son in @entity24			1
" you have to keep your enthusiasm and find ways to keep refreshed			0
you can get that by changing jobs or in one job by changing your goals , " he says			0
" i 've been lucky that i 've caddied for players that have n't played loads of tournaments in each year			2
" and it 's been interesting working with different players			2
i think it takes six to 12 months to adapt properly to a player , to learn their idiosyncrasies			0
" it just does n't happen overnight but , if you do it properly , that 's when you can help best when the chips are down			0
and the other trick is that you 're always trying to improve			0
" @entity151 may not have enjoyed the riches of @entity17 as a caddy but , having worked for former women 's world @entity155 @entity154 and with his current partnership with 2012 @entity160 @entity159 hero @entity158 , he has enjoyed the job 's trappings			1
he has also experienced the lot of many caddies scraping around to make ends meet on the global circuit			0
" i remember it used to be four of us to a room sometimes sharing two towels or whatever , " he says			0
you go to those flyaway tournaments and you 're easily spending $ 1,000 on a flight and then there 's the hotel			2
if your player misses the cut , you 're out of pocket for that week			0
that can be tough but i 'm lucky with @entity158			2
" the @entity182 's foray into the role was somewhat fortuitous			0
drinking in his local pub by @entity186 golf course one day , he was asked to stand in for a sick caddy			2
the round went well and he was invited back			0
not long afterwards he was offered voluntary redundancy in his printing industry job and he took the plunge to become a caddy full - time			2
" it 's a lot better but it 's still not quite where it should be , " says @entity151			1
" at many of the @entity82 courses you get treated fantastically well but at others it 's a case of ' what are you doing here ? ' and you 're made to feel like you 're getting in the way			2
" it 's odd as you 'll get some caddies turning up in $ 80,000 to $ 100,000 cars and yet they 're treated like idiots			1
" as for the trick to be a good caddy , @entity151 argues he has to play many different roles			1
" a caddy 's a little bit of everything : you can be a coach , a psychologist , you 're there to keep the good rounds going and to turn the bad ones around , you 're there to offer advice , be a friend , a bit of everything			2
but at the end of the day i ca n't make him play			0
" one key piece of caddy advice is not to fall out with your boss , which is understandable given @entity151 says " we spend more time together than we do with our wives probably			1
" @entity230 is slightly lower down the caddying rung than @entity17 and @entity151 in the relative infancy of his bag career , which began when his once promising playing days were curtailed by back and wrist injuries			1
he caddies for @entity236 @entity235 , for whom he was the best man at his wedding			2
it is a fledgling partnership in its second full season that is clearly working , the pair having celebrated victory at the @entity242 's @entity241 in @entity243 this month			0
" after @entity235 ' win the other day , i heard him say that ' no one knows my game better than @entity230 , ' and he 's probably right as we 've played for so long together , " says @entity230			2
" as friends , it makes it even more special to win together			0
" with @entity235 , i like to take a step back and think what 's the worst can happen in a situation and , if i have something to say , @entity235 will listen			0
" he knows at the end of the day i 'm there to help and he 's in charge so , if he does n't like the decision , he wo n't listen to it			0
" but there 's the balance of knowing when to shut up and also knowing when to take a player 's mind off things -- just to talk about anything , really , as you 're going around			0
there 's an element of being an amateur psychologist to it			0
" caddies are , in essence , the ultimate multitaskers -- but with a shelf life , very much at the whim of the players they work for			0
" often if a player is in a slump , they think the answer is to switch caddies , " says @entity151			1
" that 's not usually the answer			0
" you look at a lot of the top guys , like @entity63 with his caddy bones			0
those players are pretty honest guys and they stick with their caddies , and usually see the benefits			0
" the best players tend to have the longer caddy relationships			0
" it 's those guys that are worth their weight in gold .			0
