in 2011 , @entity25 launched @entity26 , a center working with former street children and vulnerable youth to produce sustainable shoes out of disused tires			1

" trash into treasure @entity68 's @entity67 is an initiative of his not - for - profit , @entity1 , which he established in 2005			1
the center 's goal is to help the youth realize their potential by equipping them with techniques and knowledge that they can use to " make a contribution to society within their communities			2
" " we came out with an idea of making shoes and we said what can we do that people are not doing ? " explains @entity25			0
" what can we do that will attract people to buy ? what can we do in order that will earn us money at a quicker speed and at the same time which is very cheap ? " the answers were n't far : looking around the slums , the resourceful entrepreneur saw piles of ruined tires laying strewn aside , so he decided to turn trash into treasure			2
