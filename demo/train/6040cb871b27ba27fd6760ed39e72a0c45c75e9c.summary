-- late one afternoon in the summer of 2006 , i found myself in a small village in northern @entity3 , sitting around a sooty kitchen fire with a number of local women whose language i did not speak , trying to ask them questions about marriage			1
for several months already , i had been traveling across @entity11 with a man who was soon to become my husband			1
i suppose the conventional term for such an individual would be " fiancé , " but neither one of us was very comfortable with that word , so we were n't using it			2
in fact , neither one of us was very comfortable with this whole idea of matrimony at all			2
marriage was not something we had ever planned with each other , nor was it something either of us wanted			1
yet providence had interfered with our plans , which was why we were now wandering haphazardly across @entity3 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , all the while making urgent -- even desperate -- efforts to return to @entity34 and wed. the man in question had been my lover , my sweetheart , for over two years by then , and in these pages i shall call him @entity38			1
@entity38 is a kind , affectionate @entity41 gentleman , 17 years my senior , whom i 'd met on another journey ( an actual planned journey ) that i 'd taken around the world a few years earlier in an effort to mend a severely broken heart			1
near the end of those travels , i 'd encountered @entity38 , who had been living quietly and alone in @entity49 for years , nursing his own broken heart			2
what had followed was attraction , then a slow courtship , and then , much to our mutual wonderment , love			1
our resistance to marriage , then , had nothing to do with an absence of love			1
on the contrary , @entity38 and i loved each other unreservedly			2
we were happy to make all sorts of promises to stay together faithfully forever			2
we had even sworn lifelong fidelity to each other already , although quite privately			2
the problem was that the two of us were both survivors of bad divorces , and we 'd been so badly gutted by our experiences that the very idea of legal marriage -- with anyone , even with such nice people as each other -- filled us with a heavy sense of dread			1
as a rule , of course , most divorces are pretty bad ( @entity80 observed that " getting a divorce is nearly always as cheerful and useful an occupation as breaking very valuable china " ) , and our divorces had been no exception			0
on the mighty cosmic one - to - 10 scale of @entity87 ( where one equals an amicably executed separation , and 10 equals			0
well , an actual execution ) , i would probably rate my own divorce as something like a 7.5			0
no suicides or homicides had resulted , but aside from that , the rupture had been about as ugly a proceeding as two otherwise well - mannered people could have possibly manifested			0
and it had dragged on for more than two years			0
as for @entity38 , his first marriage ( to an intelligent , professional @entity102 woman ) had ended almost a decade before we 'd met in @entity49			1
his divorce had unfolded graciously enough at the time , but losing his wife ( and access to the house and kids and almost two decades of history that came along with her ) had inflicted on this good man a lingering legacy of sadness , with special emphases on regret , isolation and economic anxiety			1
our experiences , then , had left the two of us taxed , troubled and decidedly suspicious of the joys of holy wedded matrimony			0
like anyone who has ever walked through the valley of the shadow of divorce , @entity38 and i had each learned firsthand this distressing truth : that every intimacy carries , secreted somewhere below its initial lovely surfaces , the ever - coiled makings of complete catastrophe			0
we had also learned that marriage is an estate that is very much easier to enter than it is to exit			1
unfenced by law , the unmarried lover can quit a bad relationship at any time			0
but you -- the legally married person who wants to escape doomed love -- may soon discover that a significant portion of your marriage contract belongs to the state , and that it sometimes takes a very long while for the state to grant you your leave			1
thus , you can feasibly find yourself trapped for months or even years in a loveless legal bond that has come to feel rather like a burning building			0
a burning building in which you , my friend , are handcuffed to a radiator somewhere down in the basement , unable to wrench yourself free , while the smoke billows forth and the rafters are collapsing			0
... i 'm sorry -- does all this sound unenthusiastic ? i share these unpleasant thoughts only to explain why @entity38 and i had made a rather unusual pact with each other , right from the beginning of our love story			1
we had sworn with all our hearts to never , ever , under any circumstances , marry			2
we had even promised never to blend together our finances or our worldly assets , in order to avoid the potential nightmare of ever again having to divvy up an explosive personal munitions dump of shared mortgages , deeds , property , bank accounts , kitchen appliances and favorite books			0
these promises having been duly pledged , the two of us proceeded forth into our carefully partitioned companionship with a real sense of calmness			0
for just as a sworn engagement can bring to so many other couples a sensation of encircling protection , our vow never to marry had cloaked the two of us in all the emotional security we required in order to try once more at love			1
and this commitment of ours -- consciously devoid of official commitment -- felt miraculous in its liberation			0
it felt as though we had found the @entity197 of @entity198 -- something that , as @entity200 wrote , " resembled love , but without the problems of love			1
" so that 's what we 'd been doing up until the spring of 2006 : minding our own business , building a delicately divided life together in unfettered contentment			0
and that is very well how we might have gone on living happily ever after , except for one terribly inconvenient interference			0
the @entity209 got involved .			0
