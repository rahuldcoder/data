is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence ? both judgments were offered friday on the dozens of @entity6 trucks that have rolled into eastern @entity7 , a move @entity6 leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a @entity7 official characterized as an " invasion " of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east			1
while getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment , there 's little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels -- and that 's saying something , given the volatility over the past many months			0
the latest row revolves around aid going from @entity6 to @entity7			1
@entity28 had stalled trucks on the @entity6 side of the border for days , before acknowledging sunday that the convoy , in fact , had humanitarian aid			2
that admission did n't end the discord and debate			0
as of 11:30 p.m. ( 4:30 p.m. et ) friday , 227 @entity6 vehicles had crossed into @entity7 , according to the @entity39 , which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through			1
all the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the @entity45			0
however , the @entity46 said it was n't accompanying them due to the " volatile security situation " -- a reference to continued fighting between @entity52 rebels and @entity7 forces			2
@entity7 has repeatedly accused @entity6 of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement			1
the @entity28 - based government and its allies -- including the @entity58 alliance and its core member , the @entity60 -- see this convoy as perhaps @entity63 's most glaring , egregious move yet			0
" we call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the @entity46 , " said @entity64 , the head of @entity7 's security service			2
right now , @entity7 is n't planning to go after the convoy			2
still , @entity64 thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians			0
to @entity6 president @entity77 , it is @entity7 's government -- not his -- that 's being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern @entity7			1
@entity77 expressed " serious concern " to @entity84 chancellor @entity83 about endangered civilians and other impacts from @entity7 's " continued ( military ) escalation , " according to the @entity81			1
he further criticized what he characterized as " @entity28 's blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of @entity6 humanitarian aid " into southeast @entity7 , implying he had no choice but to act			1
" further delay would have been unacceptable , " a @entity81 statement said			2
@entity60 official warns @entity6 on convoys the international community hardly embraced @entity77 's version of events			1
the @entity102 ambassador to the @entity103 said that @entity6 had no support at a @entity106 meeting friday on the topic			1
the diplomat , @entity108 , made no doubt about his own country 's views on the convoy 's entrance into @entity7			2
" it is an undeniable and blatant violation of @entity7 sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the @entity103 charter , " @entity108 told reporters			2
" it has nothing to do with humanitarianism			0
" @entity58 secretary general @entity124 warned that the the " so - called humanitarian convoy ... can only deepen the crisis in the region , which @entity6 itself has created and has continued to fuel			2
" " the disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists , " @entity124 said in a statement			0
@entity83 talked not only with @entity77 -- during which she voiced her " grave concern " -- but also with @entity60 president @entity138			1
the two leaders agreed that @entity7 " has continued to deteriorate since the tragic downing " of @entity143 17 , purportedly by @entity52 rebels , the @entity140 said			1
the pair concurred , too , that the convoy " is a further provocation and a violation of @entity7 's sovereignty " and called for the stop " of @entity6 personnel , military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern @entity7			1
" other @entity60 officials laid into @entity6 publicly			0
@entity156 spokesman rear adm. @entity155 said that @entity63 has been told in " very , very clear ( terms ) that they should not be doing this under the guise of a humanitarian convoy , to use that as an excuse to cross the border in a non-authorized way			0
" " @entity6 must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of @entity7 immediately , " @entity155 told reporters			1
" failure to do so will result in additional costs and isolation			0
" this view was seconded by deputy national security adviser @entity173 , who deemed the convoy -- which he said his nation and its allies are tracking closely -- " as part of a pattern of flagrant violation of @entity7 sovereignty			2
" the more @entity63 does such things that stir instability in @entity7 , the more it will pay , according to @entity173			0
" if ( @entity6 does ) not remove the convoys , we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them , " @entity173 said			0
@entity60 official : up to 18,000 @entity6 troops on border it 's not just the @entity6 vehicles that crossed into @entity7 that are causing consternation			1
so , too , are the @entity6 troops massed at the border			0
there were up to 18,000 such " combat - ready " troops on friday , a significant increase from previous public estimates by the @entity156 , according to a @entity60 defense official with direct access to the latest information			0
the official described the units as being in a " fully combat - capable offensive posture			0
" a second @entity60 official said that many of the units were positioned at " crossroads and towns " two to 10 miles from the border			0
" they are definitely more overt , aggressive and out in the open , " the official said			0
" they are n't even hiding it			0
" the second official said the @entity60 has believed for weeks that some @entity6 troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from @entity6 into @entity7			1
of particular concern is the apparent transport of long - range and advanced systems including at least two @entity229 surface - to - air missile system and a number of pieces of longer - range artillery			0
the fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year by a political crisis over whether @entity7 would seek closer ties with @entity239 or @entity6 -- even worse			1
@entity103 officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern @entity7 since mid-april			0
the dead include @entity243 , @entity244 's honor consul in the eastern @entity7 city of @entity246 , who @entity244 foreign minister @entity247 said had been " kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists			1
" @entity7 has time and again accused @entity6 of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels -- including militarily -- in eastern @entity7 , some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by @entity7 's military			1
@entity6 has denied any direct support for the rebels while voicing sympathy for their fight for self - determination , saying that @entity28 is in the wrong for its actions that endanger civilians -- including many ethnic @entity6			0
even if the @entity6 military does n't explicitly march into @entity7 , there are concerns that it will find other ways to bolster the rebels			1
@entity6 's ambassador to the @entity103 , @entity269 , insisted friday that the current humanitarian convoy wo n't be one of them			2
he told reporters that @entity6 received " official acceptance by @entity28 authorities " for the convoy , and that @entity63 is staying in touch with @entity7 officials to make sure there are no problems in the process of distribution of the aid			1
@entity7 's secret weapon : funding from the country 's millionaires six questions : what 's happening in @entity7 ? which foods are off @entity6 menus ?			2

@entity140 : @entity138 , @entity83 agree @entity6 convoy is " a provocation "
@entity102 ambassador : convoy " has nothing to do with humanitarianism "
@entity244 official : consul kidnapped , killed by " terrorists "
@entity77 blames @entity7 , says it *'d* be " unacceptable " to delay sending convoy
