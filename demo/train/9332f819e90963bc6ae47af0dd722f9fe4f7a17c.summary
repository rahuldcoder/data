-- can we simply enjoy movies without having to fact - check every little thing ? apparently not , because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film			1
news flash : movies are supposed to be an entertaining experience			0
they are an escape from reality			0
if you want to learn history or facts , read a book			2
or if you are too lazy to do that , then google it			0
we have seen this self - aggrandizing spectacle of people fact - checking movies with two recent films			1
the first is the current box office champion , " gravity , " with the other being " the @entity29			2
" " gravity , " which stars @entity32 and @entity33 , follows a space mission that goes terribly awry			2
despite its box office success , a chorus of critics have attacked numerous scientific flaws in the film -- such as pointing out the allegedly inaccurate way @entity32 's hair floated in zero gravity			1
but that 's nothing compared to the recent barrage of @entity45 attacks launched at the film by astrophysicist @entity47			2
his tweets ranged from criticizing the direction space debris was depicted as travelling to more nuanced issues such as faulting filmmakers for showing that the @entity53 , the @entity54 and a @entity56 space station were , " all in sight lines of one another			1
" this is not the guy you want to sit next to in a movie theater during " @entity63			0
" i can just hear him whispering things such as : " the @entity67 is too big to fly at that rate of speed , " or " @entity70 could never survive in that atmosphere			0
" look , " gravity " does n't even pretend to be based on anything more than the screenwriter 's imagination			2
and here 's the biggest thing for people like @entity47 to keep in mind : it 's science fiction , for @entity82 's sake ! you would think the " fiction " part of " science fiction " is something that an astrophysicist could comprehend			1
and then there 's " the @entity29 , " the @entity91 film about a man who served for decades as a butler for various presidents at the @entity95			2
this film was attacked by the left and the right for being historically inaccurate			0
some have cited errors with the film 's account of specific instances of the civil rights movement while others expressed outrage over the way president @entity108 was depicted -- apparently some view @entity108 as a deity			0
here 's a spoiler alert ( and by " spoiler alert , " i mean a spoiler to people who have never googled or read anything about the film ) : it was fiction -- that means it was made up			1
there was no " @entity122 , " the butler character played by @entity124 in the film			0
the film does not even purport to be a bio pic. sure , it was loosely inspired by the life of @entity130 , a man who served as a butler in the @entity95 for 34 years for eight presidents , but the film was a fictionalized account			0
and we saw similar obsessive fact - checking last year with movies such as " @entity138 " and " @entity139			1
" i guess we should be thankful that @entity45 was n't around when " @entity144 " was released because people would have gone crazy with tweets over that one			0
can we agree on something ? a director who is making a documentary should be required to present an accurate recitation of facts and history			1
but for all other movies , filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell , even ones based on real events			1
filmmakers are not historians , nor should they be held to such a standard			0
consequently , directors must be allowed to add scenes or dialogue that make the film more entertaining , such as the fictionalized depiction in " @entity138 " of @entity169 diplomats trying to board a plane to escape from @entity171 before they are discovered			1
so here 's my advice to all you self - appointed movie fact - checkers who are just waiting to pounce on any mistake you detect in a film to show off how clever you are : relax			1
go to a movie , log off of @entity45 , silence your phone , sit back , eat some overpriced cold popcorn that 's part of the criminally expensive " value combo " and watch the film			0
you never know -- you might just find that you actually enjoy it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			1

@entity187 : some popular films have come under attack for being loose with the facts
he says a film such as " gravity " is clearly science fiction ; no need to fact - check every point
only documentary filmmakers are required to be true to the events they depict , he says
@entity187 : relax and enjoy films that take *liberties* to make story lines more compelling
