-- in my line of work i get to meet a lot of talented developers , entrepreneurs and people who are just plain passionate about technology and @entity9			1
these people tell me their story , pitch me their start - ups and sometimes show me how they intend to change the world			1
i like it ; it makes me feel like i am part of something amazing			0
recently i was given the opportunity to mentor a few start - ups , and as interesting and as innovative as their ideas are , i am yet to meet a start - up in @entity9 that wants to build hardware that they hope will change the world			1
the general consensus with most of the start - ups that i have met is that they want to provide a service with the lowest barrier to entry so as to minimize costs			1
companies that are daring to build hardware are outsourcing to @entity36 , sure it 's cheaper to make things there but surely this hurts the continent 's economic growth in the end , but i digress			2
there are @entity46 start - ups / companies that are building hardware but they seem to be getting the market 's attention as easily as the established devices , which are understandable , i suppose			1
why are tablets built by @entity46 start - ups ( which there are ) not getting enough traction in the market ? is it because they just do n't stand up to the competition ? there are quite a few cool projects that tackle hardware that get an initial burst when they launch , but their products do n't seem to stay in the minds of everyday people for long , you know the consumers			1
enter the @entity72 tablet , built by @entity75 hardware pioneer @entity73 , the man that founded @entity77 , which launched @entity75 's first @entity79 - based tablet device			2
so there are gadget makers in @entity9			2
@entity73 's tablet costs between $ 250 and $ 300 but according to his site he is out of stock , which could be a sign of great success or lack of funds			0
it 's more the latter as @entity73 is looking for investors and , according to an interview with @entity92 , he feels that @entity46 investors do n't want to invest			1
" talking about venture capitalists in @entity9 , i am yet to see one that will invest ... when i mean invest , i do n't mean give seed funding of $ 50 000			2
i mean actually give $ 2 million to a business that is already gaining traction			0
so i believe they are very risk averse in investing in a market where they are not sure of a return on investment , " said @entity73			0
so is @entity9 facing an investor problem rather than a product problem ? see also : @entity9 grows , but youth get left behind it seems the consensus around this is that building physical products tends to be more expensive , and there is the problem of trying to compete with @entity36			1
in the world of cheap and affordable tablets it seems the @entity116 is winning			0
all it takes is @entity118 or @entity119 to announce a new product for a cheaper version of it to show up in the streets of @entity36			0
then there is the @entity125 , a tablet designed by young entrepreneur @entity126 in the @entity127			0
the device , though designed in the @entity127 , was assembled in @entity36 like all major manufactures seem to do			0
interestingly this @entity79 - based device is targeted at @entity46 countries and some countries in @entity132			1
it also seems to have the support of @entity135 in @entity127			0
see also : bringing the @entity136 to @entity9 perhaps this is the solution : partnering with mobile operators to launch affordable smart devices make in @entity9 aimed at the @entity46 market			1
@entity141 , a technology blogger , argues that the environment in @entity9 has " bred a generation of problem - solvers "			2
" concurrently , we 're a net importer of fabricated products from around the world			0
we might make some of our own software now , but we do little to nothing with hardware			0
how can we be the masters of our own future if we do n't do any meaningful levels of fabrication ? " he adds			0
there are some really fascinating projects that look at fabrication and building hardware , such as the @entity162 project			1
a project that recognizes the need for @entity9 to take charge of its hardware future and encourages tinkering			1
the fair is organized around @entity46 innovation and gets people together to build gadgets in a tech @entity172 environment			0
so who else is building gadgets in @entity9 and why do n't we know about them ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

most @entity46 start - ups provide services rather than hardware to minimize costs
companies building hardware seem to *struggle* for investors
@entity162 project recognizes the need for @entity9 to take charge of its hardware future
