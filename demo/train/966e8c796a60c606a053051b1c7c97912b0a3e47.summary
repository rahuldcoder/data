-- as many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in @entity3 due to the failure of a 120 - year - old sand levee along the @entity3			1
the levee , near the city of @entity8 in @entity9 , began to give way sunday night , according to the @entity14 's @entity13 / @entity12 office			1
@entity15 , a representative of the @entity16 , confirmed to @entity0 monday that the levee had in fact failed			2
" once the levee completely fails ... it is unknown how far south the flood waters of the @entity3 will travel , " the @entity14 said sunday night			1
@entity8 mayor @entity22 later told @entity0 that while the levee had n't completely broken yet , it had deteriorated			1
local prison inmates were being used to help with sandbagging , he said			2
the levee is located on the south side of the @entity3 , just south of @entity8			1
the weather agency urged residents to move to higher ground			0
roadways , including parts of @entity33 , could close			0
authorities in @entity8 worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the @entity39 last week			1
an alert sent out by @entity41 ( @entity41 ) on sunday urged residents near @entity43 to evacuate immediately ahead of the flooding , which is expected to wash out a main road leading to about 150 residences			2
" emergency vehicles including police , fire and @entity51 will not be able to reach residents , " the statement said			2
@entity53 , the deputy director of the county 's emergency management department , said sunday it was unclear how many residents remained in the area			0
" anyone in there right now wo n't be able to come out , " she said			0
a @entity62 shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents			0
the river at @entity8 is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through wednesday , @entity15 said			1
@entity8 wo n't be considered to be out of danger until the river has dropped below flood levels , he added			2
@entity15 noted that the flooding situation is not as widespread as it was during a similar 1993 flood , even though the river has now crested at a higher level than it did 17 years ago			0
the @entity3 crested around 12 a.m. monday at 20.56 feet -- roughly 3.5 feet above flood level , according to @entity15 and the @entity14 , putting major pressure on the @entity75 levee system			1
forecasts suggest the river at @entity8 will undergo a second peak in height on tuesday morning , adding more pressure to the compromised levee			1
officials with the @entity82 have been monitoring the failed levee for days and trying to repair problem areas			1
but the levee system , built in the 1890s , was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- " without any engineering design or adherence to any standards , " the @entity86 department said in a statement last week			1
" this is a 120 - year - old relic , " @entity82 spokesman @entity95 said sunday			0
" it 's made of sand			0
... a modern levee that our engineers would be familiar with would be constructed of steel and concrete			0
" the levee 's failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of @entity3 and neighboring @entity109			1
@entity8 itself , however , did not receive any of the heavy rain			2
floodgates along the @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity3 , were opened in recent days to ease pressure on dams			1
@entity117 showed a torrent of water gushing from an overflowing dam			0
" i have never seen the water rage down like it is , " @entity0 ireporter @entity121 said			0
@entity0 meteorologist @entity124 said sunday that there 's no immediate end in sight to the flooding			0
" even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they 're still in flood , so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days , " @entity124 said			0
" many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the @entity137 which then in turn will rise up and we 'll see some flooding there , maybe in @entity141 and the @entity143 areas later in the week			2
" @entity0 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
