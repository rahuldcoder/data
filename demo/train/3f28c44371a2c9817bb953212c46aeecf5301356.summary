@entity0 -- firings and charges against @entity6 officials who oversaw the agency 's flawed gun - running operation are likely to come in the next six months , attorney general @entity2 said thursday			1
@entity2 was speaking before the @entity9 on the controversial sting operation called @entity11			2
asked what steps he had taken since the controversy came to light 13 months ago , @entity2 said he is awaiting the conclusions of an internal investigation			0
regarding people found culpable in that inquiry , he said , " i can assure you those people will be removed from federal service			0
" any possible charges will not be filed until the department has the evidence to get a conviction , he said at the hearing			0
the operation , designed to monitor the flow of weapons , allowed illegally purchased firearms to be taken from @entity31 gun stores across the @entity33 border to drug cartels			0
however , hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for , and a storm of outrage erupted when two of the missing weapons were found at a site where @entity41 agent @entity41 was killed in december 2010			0
@entity41 's family filed a $ 25 million wrongful death claim wednesday against the federal government , charging that @entity31 investigators allowed murder weapons into the hands of criminals			1
" the murder of agent @entity41 and other acts of violent crimes were the natural consequence of ( the ) decision to let dangerous weapons designed to kill human beings ' walk ' into the hands of violent drug - trafficking gangs , " the claim said			0
democrats and @entity62 have been at odds over who knew what about the operation and when			2
at the outset of the hearing , new information on the operation was scarce , and the back - and - forth between members of the two parties dominated			0
rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , threatened to begin a contempt proceeding against @entity2 to force him to release more documents and pressed him for proof that such gun - running will not happen again			1
@entity62 are investigating how high up the operation was sanctioned , while @entity61 defended @entity2 's testimony that he did not know about it			1
the showdown comes after @entity73 and the @entity6 exchanged sharp letters in recent days			2
the @entity6 sent a pointed letter to @entity73 late wednesday , rejecting his demand on tuesday that certain documents be turned over by next week			1
in his letter to @entity2 , @entity73 blasted the @entity6 for dumping -- after the close of business friday -- important , long - sought documents that disclosed that assistant attorney general @entity90 had discussed with @entity33 officials a plan to allow illegal guns " to walk " into @entity33 , where @entity33 officials would arrest the gun - runners			1
@entity73 said an e-mail showed that " @entity90 suggested allowing straw purchasers cross in @entity33 so ( @entity33 authorities ) can arrest , prosecute and convict			0
" " these new documents show that @entity90 made this statement on february 4 , 2011 , the same day assistant attorney general @entity99 wrote to @entity102 denying that the department allowed guns to walk , " @entity73 said			1
the @entity6 fired back wednesday , claiming that @entity73 's letter showed " significant misunderstanding both of the documents we recently produced and of the @entity6 's position on the issues you raise			1
" the five - page letter signed by deputy attorney general @entity112 strongly rejected the claim that the documents show that @entity90 supported letting illegal guns make their way to @entity33 cartels			1
" assistant attorney general @entity90 proposed to his @entity33 counterparts a scenario in which those carrying illegal weapons across the border would be arrested at the border by @entity33 officials and charged in @entity33			2
while these officials ultimately did not pursue that strategy , it is neither fair nor accurate to say that this was advocacy of ' gunwalking '			0
" @entity62 have pressed to learn whether top @entity131 administration officials were aware of the controversial tactics , but to date , @entity90 is the highest - ranking official shown to have any awareness of any possible gun - running operation			2
@entity61 have released documents suggesting that the @entity31 attorney 's office in @entity138 and the @entity140 field office in @entity138 were at the heart of the decision - making in developing sting operations , including @entity11			0
@entity73 said in his letter to @entity2 that , " if the department continues to obstruct the congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information , this committee will have no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in contempt of @entity102			1
" the @entity6 response wednesday rejected @entity73 's february 9 deadline to produce all demanded documents			1
@entity112 called the deadline " impossible " to meet because of the broad scope of the request			0
he did not directly refer to the threat of a contempt charge by @entity73 .			0
