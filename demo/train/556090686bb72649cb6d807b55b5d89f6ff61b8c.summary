when @entity2 ' long wait for a @entity4 crown ended this month , it focused attention on the corruption scandals which have blighted @entity8 football in recent years			1
the @entity12 giants were stripped of the titles won in 2005 and 2006 and relegated to @entity14 because of their involvement , along with several other top clubs , in match fixing			1
the " @entity17 " affair saw former @entity2 managing director @entity18 banned for life by the @entity8 football authorities , and he is still facing criminal proceedings for sporting fraud			1
but while those successes were expunged from the record books , @entity2 president @entity23 has told @entity26 that they still count for everyone involved with the club -- making it 30 scudettos overall , not 28			1
after clinching the title two weeks ago with victory over @entity33 , a sign displaying the number 30 appeared at the entrance to @entity2 's new stadium , which has been used for the first time this season			1
" well for the official records it 's the 28th , for every single @entity48 ( @entity2 fan ) in the world it 's the 30th , " said the 36 - year - old @entity23 , the fourth member of the famous family which owns car manufacturer @entity42 to take the helm at @entity2			1
" it 's a very tough matter , i would say			0
one of the privileges of managing @entity2 is managing people 's dreams and emotions -- in our emotions and our feelings we have 30			2
" three stars controversy reports in @entity8 also claim that @entity2 players will have three stars embroidered inside their official club badges on shirts to be worn next season			1
the tradition of depicting a star for every 10 championships won was started by @entity23 's father @entity69 , a legendary former @entity2 president			1
the move could put the club at odds with the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) at a time when another potential match - fixing scandal has been made public			1
the @entity73 said in a statement last month that nine former @entity78 players were under investigation for the " alleged fixing of nine matches in last season 's @entity4 championship			2
" former @entity78 defender @entity84 -- now playing for @entity85 -- was arrested as part of the probe which also implicated eight of his former teammates			0
in august 2011 , former @entity85 captain and @entity8 international midfielder @entity91 was banned for three and a half years for his part in the " @entity95 " match - fixing and betting scandal involving @entity14 matches			1
it left @entity85 , who were promoted from @entity14 , with a six point penalty at the start of this year 's @entity4 season			2
three stars on their shirts or otherwise , @entity23 , who took over the helm two years ago , is on a mission to restore his club 's reputation as a major force			1
statistically the most successful team in @entity8 football history , @entity2 also won the @entity112 title in 1985 and 1996			1
@entity113 hopes not content with going unbeaten through the @entity4 season under coach @entity115 , @entity23 believes the @entity2 can win the @entity113 in their first appearance in the competition since the 2009 - 10 season			1
" it 's never too early , " he said			0
" @entity2 takes part in every single competition with ambitions of winning it			2
" the only blot on this season 's copybook came in the final match , as an unbeaten 43 - game run ended in the @entity130 final on sunday			2
a 2 - 0 defeat to @entity132 meant disappointment for @entity2 legend @entity134 in the final match of his 19 - year career with the club			1
it was a bitter pill to swallow , but @entity23 is philosophical about the defeat			0
" if they would have asked me in september , ' at the end of the year you win the @entity143 but lose the @entity130 final , ' i would have signed a hundred times no question about it , so we 're extremely proud of what we 've done , " he said			0
" i think it 's been an extraordinary result , let 's say we 've just missed a little topping on the cake and we might leave that for next year			0
" @entity23 appointed former @entity2 player @entity115 after sacking @entity153 as coach in may 2011 and it proved a master stroke			2
but @entity23 -- a graduate of @entity158 's prestigious @entity157 -- has had to overhaul the team and the club 's commercial operations in order to compete with leading @entity164 rivals			2
" there 's been a lot of changes , " @entity23 admitted			0
" what i 've tried to do is to revive the pride of being at @entity2			0
we 're all extremely proud that we 've achieved that in only two years			0
" star quality working with @entity115 , @entity23 has placed the emphasis on youth and players who are on the upward curve in their careers			0
" we might not be full of stars but we 're full of " wannabe " stars			0
he cites @entity184 midfielder @entity183 as an example : " he is going to become a star -- he 's 24 , he 's got over 40 caps for his national team , he can be a star			0
" but @entity23 also credited his more senior players such as goalkeeper @entity188 , who stayed with the club despite the relegation , and has special praise for retiring fans ' favorite @entity134			2
" i think @entity134 , as i 've said many times , will always represent @entity2 , " he said			0
" he 's been our captain for 10 years and what a finale -- lifting the trophy , that 's an amazing story			0
i think we always have to be grateful to him			0
