@entity0 -- as the @entity3 was officially dedicated sunday , speakers called for carrying on @entity5 's ideals and values and confronting issues including bullying and social and economic justice for all @entity10			1
" nearly 50 years after the march on @entity0 , our work -- dr. @entity5 's work -- is not yet complete , " president @entity12 said at the dedication ceremony			1
the nation faces many challenges , he said , including an ailing economy , substandard education , war and tragedy			2
@entity22 , he said , can often be a slow and painful process			2
during the civil rights movement , " progress was purchased through enduring the smack of billy clubs and the blast of fire hoses			2
it was bought with days in jail cells and nights of bomb threats			2
" every victory was met with setbacks and defeat , @entity12 said			1
today 's @entity10 can draw strength from that struggle , from @entity5 's belief that we are one people and from his refusal to give up , the president said			1
" let us not be trapped by what is , " @entity12 said			1
" we ca n't be discouraged by what is			2
we 've got to keep pushing for what ought to be			1
" he noted that @entity5 " will stand for all time , among monuments to those who fathered this nation and those who defended it			1
a black preacher , no official rank or title , somehow gave voice to our deepest dreams and our most lasting ideas			0
" " i know we will overcome , " the president said			0
" i know there are better days ahead			0
i know this because of the man towering over us			0
" the monument to the slain civil rights leader was due to have been dedicated on august 28 , the anniversary of the 1963 march on @entity0 when @entity5 delivered his world - altering " @entity68 " speech , but @entity69 forced the event to be postponed			1
perhaps , said the rev. @entity5 , one of @entity72 's daughters , that postponement was due to divine intervention			1
" perhaps @entity76 wanted us to move beyond the dream into action , " she said			0
" as we dedicate this monument , i can hear my father saying that oppressed people can not remain oppressed forever , " she said			0
" the yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself ... i hear my father saying what we are seeing now , all across the streets of @entity10 and the world , is a freedom explosion			0
" she called for " a radical revolution of values and reordering of priorities in this nation			2
" she urged attendees to also pay homage to her mother , @entity72 , who even as a grieving widow with four children " raised a nation in my father 's teachings and values			1
it was vitally important to her that his life and principles become institutionalized			0
" the memorial site , which features a striking 30 - foot statue of @entity5 gazing out on the iconic @entity110 , lies between the @entity111 and the @entity112 on the @entity113			1
the statue , representing a " @entity3 , " sits forward from a " @entity3			0
" visitors pass through the mountain on their way to @entity5 's statue and an expanse along the basin rimmed with an inscription wall covered with stone carvings of some of his most famous quotes			1
the four - acre area will also feature the iconic cherry blossom trees that draw thousands of tourists to the @entity113 each spring			0
" the very first time that i came to the site , i was almost overwhelmed , " @entity129 said			0
" i really was impressed by this artist			0
he was able to capture the essence of my dad			0
" on sunday , he described his father as " a champion of human rights and social justice for all people , " regardless of race , gender and ethnicity			2
" let us not forget that he paid the ultimate price for our civil rights , " he said			0
but , he said , " we 've lost our souls , " noting the recent killing of a black man in @entity151 ; child bullying ; wars in @entity154 and @entity155 ; and the lack of social and economic justice			1
@entity159 , he said , has " turned into a nightmare for millions			0
" former @entity161 evening news anchor @entity160 said that while @entity5 's main battle was racial injustice , today 's fight is against greed and for economic justice			1
" this time we judge people , not on the content of their character , but the color of their money , " he said			0
" once again , we have @entity10 on the outside looking in			0
" " there is heavy lifting to be done again , " @entity160 said			0
" and in the spirit of dr. @entity5 's lasting legacy , we need to start now			1
" if @entity5 were here today , said the rev. @entity176 , he would tell the @entity178 protesters to " keep protesting			1
" @entity10 rep. @entity181 recalled protesting in @entity0 48 years ago			0
of those that spoke near the @entity111 that day , " i 'm the only one still around , " he said			0
he recalled that @entity5 never asked protesters to do anything he would not do himself			1
" he was arrested , jailed , beaten and constantly harassed			0
he suffered the slings and arrows of hate			0
" he said he 's heard talk that nothing has changed			2
" come and walk in my shoes , " he told attendees			0
" dr. @entity5 is telling you that we have changed			1
we 're a better nation			0
" other speakers at the dedication included the rev. @entity198 ; the rev. @entity199 ; actresses @entity200 , @entity202 and 12 - year - old @entity203 ; and @entity204 , founder and president of the @entity206			2
singer @entity207 sang " @entity208 , " a tune she said @entity5 often requested			1
the @entity210 listened intently as she sang			0
@entity211 applauded in spots , while the president closed his eyes			0
the @entity12 family toured the memorial before the president 's speech			1
controversy still lingers around the statue and a quote from @entity5			1
sculptor @entity222 , who has made seven statues of @entity5 , objects to the memorial 's depiction of the icon -- and to the artist chosen to create it			1
" this idea of having this 30 - foot - tall sculpture of this man , and this confrontational look , he would not appreciate that , because that was not him , " @entity222 argues			0
he also objects to the choice of @entity235 artist @entity234			0
" i feel strongly that the whole thing should 've been done here in @entity10 , " @entity222 said			2
@entity237 , head of the dr. @entity238 , said : " we got the best man for the job			0
" and @entity234 , for his part , said @entity10 did not have sole claim on @entity5			1
" @entity129 is not only a hero of @entity10 , he 's also a hero of the world , " he said			2
celebrated poet and author @entity245 has a different objection to the memorial , saying that one of the quotes has been edited to make @entity5 appear arrogant			1
it reads : " i was a drum major for justice peace and righteousness			2
" @entity245 says an important clause was taken out of the passage from a 1968 sermon at @entity258 in @entity259			1
@entity5 's original words were : " if you want to say that i was a drum major , say that i was a drum major for justice			1
say that i was a drum major for peace			0
i was a drum major for righteousness			0
and all of the other shallow things will not matter			0
" leaving out the " if " changes the meaning , @entity245 said			1
" it should not be seen like he was so full of himself			0
he was a very humble man , " she said			0
" it is not an apt reportage of what dr. @entity5 said			1
it is an edited statement			2
" the memorial 's executive architect @entity278 stood by the wording and said there are no plans to alter the structure			2
@entity176 , who oversaw the memorial 's design and construction , said in a statement that the memorial foundation " feels comfortable with the choices we needed to make based on the space available and the messages that we wanted to convey to visitors			1
" he said a " council of historians " had been consulted , adding they suggested 14 quotations and two statements for possible inclusion on the monument 's granite walls that " best characterize and reflect " @entity5 as a leader as well as his values			1
" in no way do we believe that this paraphrased statement diminishes dr. @entity5 's intent of the words he delivered , " @entity176 said			1
" the inscription on the @entity3 comes directly from dr. @entity5 's words			1
" former @entity313 ambassador , former @entity259 mayor and civil rights leader @entity314 said @entity5 was sensitive about his small stature , as he stood only 5 feet 7 inches			1
" now he 's 30 feet tall , looking down on everybody , " @entity314 said			2
@entity1 's @entity317 , @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .			2
