-- a @entity2 rebel carves the heart out of a dead man and bites it			1
his comrades nearby cheer : " @entity7 is great			1
" this is from a video that is circulating on the @entity10			1
the appalling footage has all the world asking : what kind of people could do this ? we tell ourselves these men must be monsters , people utterly unlike us , people we could never understand			1
but we do n't say this because it is true			1
we say this because it is comforting to think so			1
the far more frightening possibility we must face is that such evil is not diabolically inhuman or beyond understanding			1
it is human -- very human			1
how can ordinary men commit such horrific acts ? the war criminals i have met did not start out by desecrating corpses , torturing villagers or murdering children			1
there are some men who are natural monsters , but most monsters are made			1
this is how you make them			1
first , take a man ( and yes , it is most often a man ) and isolate him			1
separate him from his family and friends and put him in an information bubble , an echo chamber cut off from the outside world			1
make him conform to the values of his new group by exploiting his insecurity and need for approval			1
this is the first step in any war			2
second , train him to think that the world is painted in black and white , not shades of gray			2
train him in either - or , binary thinking			2
either you are my friend or my enemy			2
either you are pure or impure			2
either the people you love are safe or they are in immediate peril			2
either you are all right or you are all wrong			2
third , physically exhaust him			2
break down his body and spirit -- through brutal training or prolonged combat -- until he ca n't think straight			2
subject him to a system of harsh and arbitrary punishment and equally arbitrary rewards			2
condition him to feel helpless			2
a man who feels like he has lost control over his life is a dangerous man , because hurting others feels like control			0
fourth -- and this is the most important part -- start small			0
work up to atrocity step by step			0
put him into a strange and frightening environment with minimal regulation			0
each violent act he commits while trying to survive will make the next act feel easier , more natural			1
the first time he kills a villager , it is terrifying			0
the second time , it is hard			0
the third or fourth time , it starts to feel almost easy			0
eventually , he finds himself competing with his fellow soldiers to see who can do it fastest , most often , most creatively			0
watching videos like this , and thinking thoughts like this , it is easy to lose hope			0
in war , are we doomed always to descend into barbarism ? the answer is no. the nightmare video from @entity2 is not inevitable			1
the very same steps used for creating monsters can also be used to stop monstrosity -- you just need to reverse the steps			1
some people are born moral heroes , but most are made			1
and this is how you make them			0
first , take a young man and start small			0
work up to altruism and moral courage step by step			0
each small thing he does to attend to the suffering of another or stand up against injustice will make the next act feel easier , more natural			1
second , give him a clear system of rules with predictable consequences			0
teach him he has the ability to make choices about his life , and that these choices matter			0
third , teach him that the world 's problems are n't as simple as us - versus - them , good - versus - evil			0
teach him that there are n't easy solutions to complex problems			0
teach him to tolerate , without fear and anxiety , life 's difficult ambiguity and uncertainty			0
and finally -- to those of you , like me , who are parents of young boys -- teach him to seek out " the other " : other clubs and groups , other sources of information , other places to see , other kinds of people , other cultural values			0
spoil him with diversity , so that if there ever comes a time when he is called to war , he will always remember to see the world through the other 's eyes			0
he will fight , but he will fight against an enemy that he sees as a person , like him			0
he will see their humanity , and in so doing , he will preserve his own			0
