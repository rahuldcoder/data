-- today is a landmark anniversary for @entity2			1
in march 1989 he wrote a proposal to his employers at @entity6 for a somewhat abstract " global hypertext " system he called @entity8			1
a year later he re-named that system the @entity11			1
a quarter of a century later , @entity2 is like a proud father , seeing his baby all grown up and making its way in the world without him			1
" i feel a certain amount of inventor 's pride , " he tells @entity0			0
" my greatest pride has been the spirit of collaboration we 've had for the last 25 years			2
" he 's watched the @entity11 grow through a carefree childhood and turbulent adolescence , reaching the kind of age when things suddenly get more serious , and it 's time to make some important decisions about the future			1
" at 25 it 's more like a young adult , " he explains			1
" suddenly it needs its independence ; young adults are at the stage when they 're looking for freedom , and in terms of what they do they 're asserting their rights			1
" now , 25 years on , web users are realizing they need human rights on the @entity11 ... we need independence of the web for democracy , we need independence of the @entity11 to be able to support the press , we need independence of the web in general			1
it 's becoming very important to sort out all that			0
" recent years have been marked by growing pains			0
revelations of mass surveillance by the @entity58 and other agencies have caused international outrage			0
arguments over net neutrality persist and copyright wars pitching open - net activists against mainstream creative industries have grown bitter , with @entity2 himself criticized at times			1
the stock and use of illicit material has grown with the dark net			0
@entity2 is clear that our ability to speak and associate freely is under threat			1
the widespread data gathering of the @entity58 revealed a " broken " system , he believes , and he praises whistle blowers like @entity76 whose leaks expose the excesses			0
" when ( systems ) break the whistle blower is the person who saves society by pointing out something that nobody else will , because it 's illegal , " he says			0
" one thing i 'd like to see built in the future is an international convention and international respect for whistle blowers			0
" if spying is one threat , @entity2 believes censorship is another			1
he recalls the situation in @entity95 , where the @entity96 was cut off at the height of anti-government protests in january 2011			0
" for a lot of people that was the first time they realized you could turn it off , and they asked themselves , who could turn it off for me ? " he says , adding that " turning off the @entity96 is more or less a signal that the regime does not trust its citizens and that the regime is on the way out			0
" at 58 , @entity2 is not taking a back seat			1
having invented the @entity11 once , he hopes to re-invent it through the " web we want " initiative , aiming to create a universal " @entity112 @entity111			1
" key targets of the manifesto include spreading net access to the nearly two thirds of the world that still does n't have it			0
establishing clear regulations is also a priority , as is the protection of personal user information			0
@entity2 still enjoys enough power over his creation to make big changes realistic , through two authorities he founded and continues to lead			2
the @entity127 ( @entity127 ) determines standards for all web infrastructure , backed by the world 's leading academic institutions and software developers			0
the @entity133 manages the spread and ethical application of the @entity11 , bringing pressure to bear on governments through initiatives such as @entity139 , which ranks nations by internet access standards			2
the web we want campaign will rely on mass mobilization across industries , nations and activist bodies to succeed , but @entity2 is confident of fostering a spirit of cooperation			1
he has seen it before and considers it the @entity11 's greatest accomplishment			2
" it 's really a story of collaboration , people working painstakingly on getting protocols right ... there 's an international spirit that ignores boundaries , " he says			0
as for what the @entity11 will look like over the next 25 years , as it enters its middle age , @entity2 sees a smarter web emerging , with users empowered by the huge amounts of personal information collected as part of the " web of data " -- information that could help personalize our web experience			1
" people are worrying about what other people are doing with their data , " he says , " but they have n't realized what they can do with their own data			0
" as we grow more connected to , and reliant on , the @entity11 , so the potential for abuse increases			2
how we use such a powerful tool amounts to a test of our species , says @entity2 , but it 's one he is confident we can pass together			2
" in general the @entity11 enables humanity to be more powerful and that power can be used for good things and to do horrible things -- but on balance when it comes to humanity i 'm a tremendous optimist			2
" in pictures : what the @entity96 really looks like			0

at 25 the @entity11 is like a " young adult , " he says . " it needs its independence "
