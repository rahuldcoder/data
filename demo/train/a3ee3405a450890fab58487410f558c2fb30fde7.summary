@entity0 , @entity1 -- a top manager at one of @entity1 's two nuclear power plants says he 's " 100 percent confident " the facility 's countermeasures will keep the overflowing @entity8 from damaging critical gear and causing a hazard to the public			1
the @entity12 , about 80 miles south of @entity13 , is still in operation and several feet above the swollen waterway			1
@entity17 chairman @entity16 toured the plant monday , along with a plant north of @entity13 that is already surrounded by floodwaters			1
" i am not going to predict what is going to happen with the water level , " @entity16 said			0
" our job is to make sure the licensee does their job to make sure the plant stays safe			0
right now , it appears they are taking proactive steps to do that			0
" the @entity17 says both @entity32 and the @entity34 plant , about 20 miles north of @entity13 , have taken precautions against this summer 's flooding			1
and @entity37 , a reactor operator at @entity32 , said even high water wo n't cause a radiation leak			1
" i am 100 percent confident that we are not going to have an issue here , " @entity37 said			0
" if river levels continue to rise , we will follow our procedures , we will shut down the plant , do whatever is required to maintain our safety			1
" at @entity34 , as much as two feet of water has forced plant workers to navigate a catwalk from the parking lot , and a water - filled berm that surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings was punctured by a worker early sunday			1
a representative of the manufacturer is at the plant helping assess whether the berm can be repaired , the plant 's owner , the @entity58 , said			0
but the plant has been shut down for refueling since april , and authorities have put floodgates , sandbags and other barriers in place to help protect the facility			0
despite the flooding , @entity34 is designed to withstand water up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level , according to the @entity58			1
the river is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet , the @entity58 said			2
plant managers also have brought in additional diesel fuel for generators should the site lose electricity			0
workers switched to those generators briefly to keep the plant 's spent fuel cool after water came too close to electrical transformers , but the plant was again drawing power from the electrical grid , utility spokesman @entity80 said monday			0
" the plant is designed , when they get to these higher flood levels , to use their diesel generators when necessary , " @entity16 said			0
it was catastrophic flooding from @entity98 's march 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the @entity101 nuclear power plant , resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since @entity104			2
this year 's @entity106 flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the @entity34 plant that @entity58 and the @entity17 have been trying to knock down			1
the utility has set up a " flood rumor control " page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant			0
an electrical fire june 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes , but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service , it has said			0
heavy rainfall in @entity125 and @entity126 , combined with melting snow from the @entity128 , have sent the @entity8 surging downstream this summer			2
the river washed over and punched through levees in northwestern @entity8 , spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes			1
the 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper @entity8 basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year 's worth , and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140 % of normal , according to forecasters			2
the @entity8 is forecast to remain at record or near - record levels from south of @entity13 all the way to @entity142 , @entity143 , into next week			1
the flooding is affecting communities in @entity1 , @entity143 and @entity8			2
@entity2 's @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

new : nuclear *regulator* tours plants along the swollen @entity8
critical gear has been protected at both plants , officials say
floodwaters have *encroached* on the idled @entity34 plant
the still - operating @entity32 plant remains several feet above the river
