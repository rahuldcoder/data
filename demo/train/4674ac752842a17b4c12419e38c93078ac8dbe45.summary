-- president - elect @entity2 's mother - in - law will be moving to @entity3 with the first family , at least temporarily , his transition team has confirmed			1
@entity6 will be the latest in a line of presidential in - laws who , for good or ill , lived under the same roof as the president			1
president @entity11 and his mother - in - law , @entity12 , pose for pictures with some of the grandchildren			1
here are four stories that confirm the old truism : while @entity18 can choose its president , the president ca n't choose his in - laws			1
@entity21 and ' @entity22 ' you would think that the @entity24 was settled at @entity25 , and no question of its outcome would have been raised in the @entity29 of @entity21 , who , after all , was the general who won the war			2
but you would be wrong , because living with @entity31 and @entity32 was the president 's father - in - law			1
colonel @entity35 ( his rank seems to have been self - selected ) was an unreconstructed @entity37 , a @entity39 businessman and slaveholder who , when his daughter @entity41 went to the @entity42 early in 1869 , decided to relocate there as well			0
@entity22 did n't hesitate to make himself at home			0
when his daughter received guests , he sat in a chair just behind her , offering anyone within earshot unsolicited advice			0
political and business figures alike got a dose of the @entity22 's mind as they waited to meet with president @entity21			1
when the president 's father , @entity52 , came from @entity54 on one of his regular visits to @entity3 , the @entity29 turned into a @entity24 reenactment			1
according to " @entity58 : the impact of the @entity29 on their lives " , by @entity59 , @entity52 preferred to stay in a hotel rather than sleep under the same roof as the colonel			2
and when the two old partisans found themselves unavoidably sitting around the same table in the @entity29 , they avoided direct negotiations by using @entity41 and her young son , named for the president 's father , as intermediaries , @entity73 writes in " @entity75 " : " in the presence of the elder @entity21 , @entity35 would instruct @entity41 to ' take better care of that old gentleman [ @entity52 ]			1
he is feeble and deaf as a post and yet you permit him to wander all over @entity3 alone			0
' and @entity21 replied [ to his grandson and namesake ] , ' did you hear him ? i hope i shall not live to become as old and infirm as your @entity84			2
' " mental floss : 5 feisty first daughters @entity22 remained in the @entity29 -- irascible and unrepentant -- until his death , at age 88 , in 1873			2
@entity89 and the @entity90 from @entity91 @entity89 and @entity92 met as children			2
he was a farm boy ; she was the well - heeled granddaughter of @entity95 , @entity97 's @entity96			2
when they married in 1919 , @entity89 was a struggling haberdasher , and @entity92 's mother , @entity100 , thought @entity92 had made a colossal social faux pas			1
until she died in 1952 , @entity100 never changed her mind about @entity89			2
her @entity92 had married way below her station			0
@entity100 had plenty of opportunities to let her son - in - law know it			2
the newlyweds moved into the @entity111 mansion in @entity95 , and the three lived together under the same roof until the end of @entity100 's life			0
when @entity89 was elected senator , " @entity111 , " as @entity89 judiciously called her , moved with her daughter and son - in - law to @entity3			1
in the family 's apartment , she shared a bedroom with the @entity124 ' daughter , @entity123			0
and when @entity89 became president , she moved with them into the @entity29 , where she cast her cold eye on the new commander - in - chief			1
" why would @entity89 run against that nice mr. @entity132 ? " she wondered aloud , as @entity89 was fighting for his political life in the 1948 presidential race , according to " @entity131 " by @entity59			2
and when @entity89 fired gen. @entity133 for insubordination , mother @entity100 was scandalized			1
" imagine a captain from the @entity136 [ @entity89 ] telling off a @entity138 general ! " in december 1952 , shortly before @entity89 's term ended , @entity100 died , at age 90			1
for the 33 years they lived together , she never called her son - in - law anything but " mr. @entity89 " to his face			1

@entity11 and the @entity146 if @entity89 's story sounds like the set - up for a film noir , his successor 's relationship with his mother - in - law might have been a @entity154 musical			1
@entity156 , @entity157 's mother , was " a witty woman with a tart tongue , " @entity155 wrote , and @entity11 thought she was a hoot			1
" she refuted every mother - in - law joke ever made , " @entity160 wrote			1
there was no question that she would join her daughter and son - in - law in the @entity29			1
@entity11 called her " @entity168 , " the name of a character in the @entity172 comic strip			2
