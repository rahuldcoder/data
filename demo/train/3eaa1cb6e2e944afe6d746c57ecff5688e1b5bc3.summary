-- @entity3 players @entity1 and @entity4 made sportsmanship a prime topic for discussion when they said after their @entity9 championship win against the 49ers that they targeted punt returner @entity12 , who has suffered four concussions			1
@entity1 said of @entity12 during a locker room interview : " we knew he had four concussions , so that was our biggest thing , to take him out of the game			1
" @entity4 told the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , that @entity12 was a target because " he 's had a lot of concussions			1
we were just like , ' we got ta put a hit on that guy			2
' ... " the significance of these comments is compounded by the fact that concussions , and the health and safety issues related to them , have become a main concern of the @entity35 and its players			1
former players are suing the @entity35 over concussion issues and will appear in court this week			1
major rule changes and an elaborate fine system have been implemented to protect players			1
former players suffer psychologically and neurologically , and we now know it 's because of concussions and subconcussive blows to the head			1
boast of targeting punt returner raises questions about concussions unfortunately , the words of these two young men are n't the first examples of dishonorable behavior and the ignoble mentality that exist in sports , nor will they be the last			1
it 's time , however , for everyone to realize how dysfunctional and unnecessary this type of behavior is			1
i know all too well that there are some contemptible and devious minds who intend to " take players out			1
" in my nine - year @entity35 career , knees were cut , elbows were thrown , helmets were used as missiles , ankles were twisted , and i was even bitten ! all of these acts were instigated by an insatiable desire to taste victory , even if it meant disabling the opposition to do so			1
during the weekly scouting report , there was always a special presentation about which players on the opposing team had injuries			2
we knew exactly who was hurting and where			2
if an ankle was injured , we knew which one			2
if it was a rib , we knew which side of the body it was on			2
" take him out of the game			2
" that was the @entity98			0
sad , i know , but in the sports world , c'est la vie			0
some say football is a violent game and all the rule changes to protect players are making the game soft			2
they say go play a different sport if you ca n't take the big hits			2
i say to all the uneducated players , wannabe players , couch potatoes and pundits in suits chirping from cozy air - conditioned rooms , many of whom have never played the game : this does n't affect you			1
your long - term health is n't at risk , nor will your kids risk losing you prematurely to a death caused by a psychological and neurological disorder acquired from repetitive head trauma			0
do you want to hear something that is really scary ? according to the @entity129 , the average life expectancy of an @entity35 player is 58 years			1
that is considerably lower then the 76 - year life expectancy of the average @entity132			0
knowing this , should we not attempt to play the game fairly and with respect for our fellow man ? four - time @entity140 safety @entity138 committed suicide last february			0
he killed himself with a gunshot to the chest instead of the head , presumably so that his brain could be examined by @entity146 for the @entity147			2
the @entity148 reported that @entity138 also sent text messages to family members asking " that his brain be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy , " a condition linked to more than a dozen deceased @entity35 players			1
researchers said his brain had developed the same trauma - induced disease recently found in other deceased players			1
the number of retired @entity35 players found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy is growing			1
@entity138 , who complained to his family of his deteriorating mental state during his final months , is the first to act upon his suspicion of having the disease			0
so , was it wrong for the @entity3 players to target a man 's head when they knew he had already suffered four documented concussions ? i 'd say yes			1
those who display this type of behavior and intent must be reprimanded and punished			2
players in the @entity35 are now fined for helmet - to - helmet contact , so it makes sense that targeting someone who has suffered four concussions and having the intent to " take him out of the game " would be fineable , also			1
in sports , or business , people always look for a competitive edge			0
whether that edge is physical , mental or psychological , the great ones always seek it			0
it 's what separates the mighty from the mundane			0
it 's why some people get up early to put in work while others continue to sleep			0
it 's why some people stay in the gym , at the office , or study for an exam while everyone else goes home			0
there is such a thing , however , as taking it too far			0
when getting the upper hand causes another person bodily harm , it has gone too far			0
not only are you threatening someone 's livelihood , you 're threatening their long - term health , their life			0
even though the rules may not be written yet , they should be understood			0
i hope that @entity1 and @entity4 were just carried away by the moment			0
my hope is that they now realize that the extent and potential outcomes of their intentions are frightening			0
they have tremendous talent and opportunity , and there is no reason for them to harm others on their journey to success			0
i wish them nothing but the best			0
those two men , and all of us , are more powerful than we know			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity35 *veteran* says @entity3 players wrong if they targeted a 49er who has had concussions
@entity237 : i know from my playing days that opponents often target an injured player
wire : with all we know about how hits affect the brain , player behavior needs to change
