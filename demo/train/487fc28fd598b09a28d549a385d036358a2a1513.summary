@entity2 will help fight the antisocial and " emasculating " habit of compulsive smartphone checking , @entity1 co-founder @entity0 said in a surprise appearance at the @entity7 wednesday			1
in his 10 - minute @entity7 , @entity0 did n't provide concrete new details on @entity2 , a cross between a smartphone and a pair of glasses			1
but he did confess that , having used @entity2 , he felt emasculated and isolated every time he checked his regular smartphone			1
" you 're actually socially isolating yourself with your phone , " @entity0 told the audience			1
" i feel like it 's kind of emasculating ...			1
you 're standing there just rubbing this featureless piece of glass			0
in contrast to a smartphone , @entity2 allows people to keep their head up as digital information is overlaid onto their world , no matter where their gaze is pointed			2
" i whip this out and focus on it as though i have something very important to attend to , " @entity0 added later , holding up his phone			2
" this [ @entity2 ] really takes away that excuse ...			0
it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent secluded away in e-mail or social posts			0
" opinion : why life through @entity2 should be for our eyes only @entity0 also said @entity2 helps advance a longstanding dream of his to let users receive highly relevant information without actually having to run searches			2
" my vision when we started @entity1 15 years ago was that eventually you would n't have to have a search query at all â€” the information would just come to you as you needed it , " @entity0 said			2
" this is the first form factor that can deliver that vision			0
" of course , devices like @entity2 are sure to have downsides as well			0
hopefully not too many conversations fall dead as one party becomes immersed in highly targeted information overlaid onto their view of the other person			0
surely losing your friend 's eye contact halfway through a sentence would be emasulating and socially isolating in its own way			1
