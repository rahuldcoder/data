@entity1 officials will review the nation 's lung transplant policy for children , but any change could take up to two years , not enough time to save the life of a 10 - year - old @entity9 girl who 's already been waiting 18 months for new lungs			1
@entity12 , a nonprofit that manages the nation 's transplant system under federal contract , agreed to the review friday , the same day that an urgent request was made by @entity19 secretary @entity18 , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity11 said			1
but because the review process involves research and public comment and because there 's not enough organ donations for children , the nation 's transplant system wo n't likely be able to save the life of @entity27 , who could die within weeks without a transplant of lungs			1
when pressed on this emerging reality , @entity11 stated : " i do n't have anything additional to add			2
" @entity11 urged more @entity1 to look at an organ donation website			2
@entity11 added in a subsequent e-mail to @entity35 : " with 18 people dying on the wait list every day in this country , the only way to save more lives is with more donors , " she said			0
" just one organ donor can save the lives of up to 8 people			0
" @entity18 asked for a review of the nation 's transplant system friday			1
" i ask that you pay particular attention to the age categories currently used in lung allocation , and review the policy with the intent of identifying any potential improvements to this policy that would make more transplants available to children , " @entity18 said in a letter to the @entity12			1
@entity27 's struggle has ignited a fight for new rules governing organ donations			0
she 's been in a @entity63 hospital for months due to cystic fibrosis that she 's had since birth			0
tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on @entity70 , and a congressman has called on the @entity73 administration to take quick action			0
the girl is eligible for a lung from another child but is n't prioritized for a lung from an adult , under federal rules			1
with just weeks left , @entity27 fights the system for life - saving pair of lungs @entity84 asked for the review of the federal policy in a letter to dr. @entity88 , board president of the @entity12			1
@entity84 cited the significant disparity in the number of transplantable organs to the number of people in need of an organ , especially among pediatric patients			0
she also directed the @entity97 of @entity98 to consider new approaches for promoting pediatric and adolescent organ donation			0
" with 1,819 pediatric patients on organ transplant waitlists and only 852 pediatric organ transplant donors each year , it is especially clear that we can and should , if possible , do more to encourage the public to become registered organ donors , " @entity84 wrote			2
@entity27 is at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her region			2
she 's been waiting for 18 months			0
but doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often			1
that 's where the rules becomes a problem			0
children under age 12 are n't prioritized for adult organs			1
so @entity27 could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down			1
@entity27 's mother , @entity131 , told @entity35 she was " shocked " when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago			2
organ donation by the numbers			0
