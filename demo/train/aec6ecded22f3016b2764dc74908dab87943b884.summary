@entity1 sovereignty wo n't be the only casualty of @entity5 president @entity4 's efforts to assert @entity5 influence and interest in @entity8			1
it 's still far too early to calibrate how this crisis will play out and what its consequences will be -- but it 's a fair bet that whether it ends in a @entity4 victory , defeat , or draw , it 's going to make a difficult situation in the @entity16 even more complicated			1
whether @entity4 wins or loses in @entity1 , the odds that @entity5 could be a reliable partner for the @entity19 have decreased dramatically			1
and this only reinforces the painfully obvious : when it comes to the core issues facing the @entity19 in the @entity16 , the @entity19 must focus on outcomes , not solutions , and be very sober about what it might do to contribute to them			2
@entity5 's friends as go @entity4 's fortunes , so go those of @entity31 president @entity30			1
however the crisis turns out , with one possible exception , the @entity31 regime is likely to benefit			0
and that exception is the highly unlikely contingency that @entity4 is so weakened from a botched policy in @entity1 or an uncharacteristically bold response from the @entity19 and the @entity39 that he is permanently damaged and diminished , or removed from power			1
the possibility that events in @entity1 will leave @entity4 victorious will only buck up @entity30 further and demonstrate that @entity5 street cred is rising			2
after all , in september , @entity4 masterfully intervened and used diplomacy to stay a @entity19 military response against @entity30 's use of chemical weapons against civilians			1
now @entity4 appears to be standing up to the international community and ready to use force to protect @entity5 's interests in @entity1			2
he 's clearly not prepared to do that for @entity31			0
but victories for @entity5 , particularly in the face of the @entity39 's empty rhetoric and red lines , can only reinforce @entity30 's conviction that he 's betting on the right ally			0
@entity1 mobilizes troops amid crisis with @entity5 a @entity4 win -- maintaining significant @entity5 influence in @entity1 that clearly undermines @entity1 's sovereignty -- will leave @entity5 stronger and more dependable as a partner and ally in the eyes of @entity30 and , probably , @entity67			1
although @entity67 is not nearly as dependent on @entity70 as @entity30 is , @entity69 ayatollah @entity68 looks at the crisis and sees @entity5 resolve in the face of a feeble @entity39			0
the hardliners in @entity75 will draw their own conclusions about their margin for maneuver in maintaining nuclear weapons aspirations			0
@entity5 has never been as allergic as @entity19 to the possibility that @entity67 will become a nuclear threshold weapons state			2
@entity67 will cut its own deal with @entity19 on the nuclear issue if it gets the right terms , regardless of what @entity4 thinks			1
but given the long odds against a comprehensive accord , should diplomacy fail , @entity75 will likely be able to count on @entity5 to block punitive action in the @entity90 and discourage the use of @entity19 military force			1
a @entity4 defeat in @entity1 wo n't help matters in the @entity16 much either , unless the crisis somehow delivers a knockout blow to @entity4			1
a chastened @entity4 would probably be even more ornery and recalcitrant about cooperating with the international community on @entity16 issues			2
but either way , the @entity5 are determined to frustrate @entity19 solutions to @entity16 problems that seem like a @entity102 and exclude @entity70			0
the reaction to the @entity39 's efforts -- to meddle in what @entity4 believes is @entity5 's sphere of influence and to oppose @entity70 -- will create a @entity108 that could , for the remainder of the @entity111 administration and probably beyond , freeze productive @entity19 - @entity5 cooperation across the board			1
small powers are watching beyond this , should @entity5 manage to have its way in @entity1 , smaller powers will take notice , particularly those nations whose interests can be at odds with the @entity39 and the @entity19 @entity5 is not a small power			1
but it is standing up to @entity19 and the @entity39			0
and for the true smaller powers , how " big " reacts when faced with a challenge from " small " can be instructive			0
and the @entity31 , @entity67 and @entity126 will pay attention to the @entity39 's resolve			2
it ca n't be a good thing if @entity5 acts in @entity1 without cost and consequence			0
@entity133 is n't a friend of @entity5 nor an adversary of the @entity19 but the @entity133 have already seen what @entity19 words mean when it comes to their own determination to continue settlement policy , and to @entity19 threats to use military force in @entity31 , or even against @entity67			1
and they have concluded that words mean very little			0
the @entity146 have reached many of the same conclusions about the @entity111 administration 's willingness to say what it means -- and more important , act upon what it says			1
@entity19 's image over the years , @entity19 has gotten into trouble when the issue of protecting its credibility is the be-all and end - all , in defiance of common sense and wise policy			0
@entity162 comes from believability -- when a president speaks of policy , he will make good on his words , if need be			0
if there is is no cost or consequence for saying no to the @entity19 , then @entity169 will have zero street cred			0
at the same time , if the @entity19 tries to maintain credibility by doing dumb or stupid things , or by overreaching , it undermines what it 's attempting to protect			0
the @entity111 administration 's street cred is very low			1
everyone says no to the @entity19 , seemingly without consequence : @entity30 ; @entity4 ; @entity183 's president @entity182 ; @entity126 leader @entity184 ; @entity186 's president @entity185			2
it seems the @entity19 even gets " yes , buts " from friends and allies like @entity133 president @entity191 and @entity193 president @entity192			0
partly this comes from the @entity19 setting expectations too high ; misreading the way the world actually is ; underestimating how determined smaller powers can be ; and it comes from the reality that @entity19 does n't control the world now and never did			0
we have a very risk - averse president who 's focused more on domestic affairs than foreign policy			1
and he is a leader more committed to improving the middle class as his legacy than he is to the @entity16 and its insoluble troubles			0
that president is facing a crisis in @entity1 , where geography , history , and proximity favor @entity4 and leave @entity169 with a weaker hand			2
perhaps some face - saving win - win can be devised			0
but if not -- and perhaps unfairly , because @entity111 's options are bad ones -- @entity19 will again be judged a weak and feckless power			2
as for the @entity16 , regardless of how @entity1 goes , the president 's fortunes will remain more or less the same : the @entity19 will remain shackled with a @entity4 who is no friend and stuck in a region it can neither repair nor leave .			1

@entity224 : @entity4 's intervention in @entity1 affects more than @entity1 's sovereignty
@entity224 : this crisis and @entity19 response will affect how @entity16 nations see @entity19
he says if @entity4 looks strong and @entity19 looks *ineffectual* , @entity31 , @entity67 and others take notice
@entity224 : @entity111 administration is risk - averse , and faces long odds *vs.* @entity4 on @entity1
