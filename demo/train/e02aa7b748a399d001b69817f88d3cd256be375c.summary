-- airmen toss dirt bikes out the rear of an airborne plane			1
then , a so - called " bike chaser " jumps out after them			0
when @entity9 troops take control of an airfield in a combat zone , this often is how it begins			1
the motorbikes float to earth along with the bike chaser , who quickly cranks one of the motorcycles to life			0
soon , the airfield is secured and ready for incoming @entity9 aircraft			1
that 's a typical mission for @entity26 combat control teams , @entity27 for short			1
and , along with seizing airfields , they help ground force commanders and pilots pinpoint targets in war zones			1
these kinds of special forces could be useful on the ground in @entity37 , military analysts say , in the event of @entity9 airstrikes against @entity42 extremists			1
the @entity43 has its seals			0
and the @entity26 has combat controllers : a lesser known special ops ground force sometimes referred to as " ground pounders			1
" maj. @entity51 , who served with @entity27 in @entity37 and @entity52 , spent a few minutes on the phone with @entity0 wednesday to offer an inside perspective on these highly trained , elite squads			2
" all of our guys are trained to ride motorcycles , " says @entity51			0
sometimes going to work " involves jumping out of an airplane , or sliding out a helicopter down a fast rope , or riding some sort of all - terrain vehicle , or going on a mountain path on foot			0
" combat controllers are trained to help fighter pilots hit their targets more accurately without killing innocent civilians or friendly troops			1
that 's a resource that military analysts say would be important now in @entity37 's efforts to combat @entity75 militants			1
@entity37 's government has asked the @entity9 for airstrikes against @entity75 , as it encroaches on the nation 's key cities			1
limited airstrikes might be possible , analysts say , if @entity9 forces were inserted where they could accurately identify targets			1
for days , military sources have said @entity75 fighters are dispersed and mixed with local populations , making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes			0
@entity90 gen. @entity89 , who served in @entity37 and @entity52 , told the @entity91 this month , " it 's feasible for the @entity9 to play a limited role with air power with ( special operations forces ) combat controllers and limited advisers			1
" on thursday , president @entity98 announced the @entity9 had " positioned additional @entity9 military assets in the region			1
" " because of increased intelligence resources , " he said , the @entity9 is " developing more information about potential targets associated with ( @entity75 ) , and going forward , we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it			1
" the president did n't offer any specifics			0
related story : who are the @entity9 advisers heading to @entity37 ? let 's not forget that at the beginning of the @entity52 war in 2001 , ground controllers teamed up with @entity119 fighters to help @entity9 pilots target and smash the @entity121			1
it 's surprising : in this age of superaccurate smart bombs and camera - enabled , missile - toting drones , @entity51 says human targeting intelligence remains the gold standard			2
" people think that because they see it in a @entity133 movie " that technology can do everything , @entity51 says			0
" but i do n't think we 're ever going to have a totally , 100 % air - centric war			1
i think we 're always going to need boots on the ground			2
" their job ranks among the most dangerous in the military			0
think about it : these guys regularly work near or inside the target zones of some of the most fearsome flying machines devised by man : the a- 10 " warthog , " the @entity150 stealth bomber , the @entity152 helicopter , the @entity153 and the ac - 130 gunship			2
' it can be kind of squirrelly ' falling safely from the air to the ground with all that gear is no small feat. a typical drop comes with two motorcycles			1
bike sizes often range from minibikes with 100 cubic centimeter engines to dirt bikes with 250 cubic centimeter engines			1
the motorcycles are dropped in packages called " bike bundles			0
" small bikes have parachutes attached to the handlebars			2
" it 's small enough you can literally pick it up and just throw it out the back of the aircraft , " says @entity51			2
" and that 's what they 'll do			2
" engines are limited to around 250 cubic centimeters , @entity51 says , because the combat controllers are riding with 100 pounds of gear on their backs			2
" when you have your center of gravity that high , it can be kind of squirrelly , " he says			0
" so we do a fair amount of training , " starting with a certified @entity194 course followed by intensive experience with various four - wheeled all - terrain vehicles and side - by - sides			0
bike chasers retrieve and mount the motorcycles and use them to quickly secure the air field runways and clear them of obstacles			2
" hopefully the bike 's got an electric start â € ” and not just a kickstarter , " @entity51 says			0
if the bike takes a tumble when it lands , that could temporarily mess up its fuel system , he says , making it troublesome to fire up with a kickstarter			0
in addition to helping @entity215 air targets , these troops also work to protect civilians and allied forces on the ground			1
" if they 're being fired on by the enemy , we can bring in aircraft , " @entity51 says			0
controllers also have access to special airborne surveillance assets that give them " eyes in the sky " for @entity9 ground troops who need to know " what 's on the other side of that building , " as @entity51 put it			1
" when you 're pinned down and ca n't move , having eyes in the sky to take out the enemy is pretty instrumental in making sure your guys come back alive			0
" air control for earthquake victims attached to the @entity26 24th @entity240 at @entity241 , @entity242 , these guys are @entity244 certified air traffic controllers			1
in 2010 , the @entity27 deployed to @entity245 , responding to a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that left more than 230,000 people dead			0
at the airport in @entity252 , " nobody was sure of the structural integrity of the tower , " says @entity51			0
" so they set up in the infield and they landed 200 planes a day â € ” all with notebook paper , a card table and handheld radios			0
" two - hundred planes a day rivals air traffic at some of the world 's busiest airports , including @entity266 and @entity268 's @entity267			2
the camaraderie you might expect between pilots and combat controllers is strong , @entity51 says			2
" it 's always neat when you 've worked with a guy here in the @entity9 and then go overseas and they call up and you recognize their call sign			1
" there 's also some professional , good - natured rivalry			0
" we remind them that they 're flying around in their air - conditioned cockpits , " he says			0
" we 're on the ground in the heat and humidity , carrying 100 pounds on our backs			0

combat control teams are the @entity26 's lesser known elite special ops ground force
they parachute into war zones and help ground force commanders and pilots pinpoint targets
combat control teams use special dirt bikes to seize air fields
they also use airborne surveillance to protect @entity9 ground troops and friendly civilians
