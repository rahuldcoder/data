-- an @entity2 being held in a @entity4 prison said he is innocent and described his treatment in a " hellhole " in an exclusive phone interview with @entity0 's @entity8 on thursday			1
" i do n't know the reason that i 'm here , " @entity9 said			1
" that 's been a mystery from the very beginning			2
what the motives behind the police and the prosecution have been			2
" @entity9 , a 35 - year - old from @entity19 , has been behind bars since august 2010 , when @entity4 authorities raided his real estate office in the coastal tourist city of @entity24			1
@entity0 profiled @entity25 in february			2
in november , a @entity4 judge found @entity25 guilty of money laundering , drug trafficking and organized crime and sentenced the @entity2 to 22 years			1
but a chorus of supporters say that there is no evidence to support the charges and that @entity25 's prosecution was rife with legal mistakes and misconduct			2
@entity9 's family and supporters have said that while visiting him at @entity40 , they 've been shocked to see he 's gotten very ill and is disturbingly underweight			1
" we 're really afraid that his body wo n't be able to take this much longer , " said @entity41 , who was allowed to visit her brother in prison several months ago			2
@entity9 described to @entity8 what it 's like at @entity40 prison near @entity50			1
" it 's basically a hellhole , " he said			1
" there are concrete cells that are overcrowded			2
" i 've been in a cell with anywhere from 9 to 12 people in a 12 - by - 15 - foot cell , " @entity9 continued			1
" it 's hot ; it 's dirty ; it 's festy			0
there 's lots of insects , including chiggers and ants and mosquitoes			0
there 's no running water			0
i have to fight every day to get your two buckets of water			0
there 's no good food			0
we get rice and beans three times a day , and it has a bicarbonate added to it to make the prisoners feel full , so i ca n't even eat this stuff			0
" i had to go to the hospital , " he said			0
" so , basically , right now , i survive on crackers and peanuts and raisins			2
" those fighting to free @entity25 include the director of the @entity88 , the human - rights attorney who helped win freedom for @entity93 @entity92 laureate @entity91 and an @entity95 agent who was one of the early champions of @entity98 's innocence			0
@entity2 rep. @entity99 , @entity100 , said in february that @entity9 's arrest is tantamount to kidnapping ( @entity103 )			1
even the three @entity2 hikers freed from @entity105 have spoken out against the @entity2 's conviction			1
recently , a special group of independent legal experts with the @entity109 declared that @entity4 was violating international law ( @entity103 ) by imprisoning @entity25 and that he should be immediately released			1
@entity25 's defense team provided the group 's recommendation to @entity0			2
since @entity0 began reporting @entity25 's story , it has made numerous attempts on the phone and in person in @entity4 to obtain comment from officials involved in @entity9 's case			1
each attempt has been rebuffed			0
@entity8 asked @entity9 whether he thought the @entity109 group 's opinion would increase the chances that officials in @entity4 will release him			1
" i would hope so , that the administration of @entity4 would value the independent @entity109 opinion about my case , " @entity9 answered			1
" however , it 's been a couple weeks since that has been publicly released and about a month since @entity4 has refused that privately , and yet i 'm still sitting here			0
" @entity9 went to @entity4 in 2002 , shortly after graduating from college in @entity19 , to work for the @entity135			1
he stayed there because he fell in love with the country , @entity41 said			0
he met the woman who would become his wife , a @entity4 national , and they had a child			0
@entity9 developed a successful real estate business in @entity24 and was even featured on the @entity146 show " @entity147			1
" he was in his office in 2010 when @entity4 authorities burst in with their guns drawn , he told @entity8			1
" i was shocked , " he said			0
" i had donated to the police department in @entity24			0
and i had interacted with them on a positive basis previously , but when guys in masks and assault rifles stormed into my office , i thought i was being robbed			0
" i did n't know what was going on until a plainclothes guy with a badge around his neck came in and asked for me			0
and then he still did n't tell me for the next two days -- even after they arrested me -- why i was being arrested or for what it was all about			0
" the @entity4 government accused @entity25 of being part of a group of drug traffickers , but @entity171 's defense team says investigators could not establish links between @entity25 and 10 @entity4 who were convicted with him			1
@entity175 , a well - known international human rights attorney who helped free @entity91 , said @entity9 has never met the other defendants , and the co-defendants told the judge in the case that they had never met @entity9			1
when @entity41 , a lawyer in @entity180 , approached @entity175 with her brother 's case , he immediately took it			2
" i knew that something was very wrong here " after reviewing the court documents , he said			0
the @entity187 rendered its opinion that @entity25 should be freed in response to a petition ( @entity103 ) @entity175 filed this year			0
the document detailed numerous alleged flaws in the case against his client			2
the @entity195 does n't have the authority to force a country to act in response to its opinions , but it can send a strong diplomatic and political message , @entity175 said			0
" the fact that @entity9 is the only one of more than 3,000 @entity2 imprisoned abroad ( to have the support of the @entity109 ) , the @entity109 calling for his release should demonstrate to the @entity4 government that its failure to resolve this case quickly will have serious diplomatic consequences , " he said			1
in response to questions about @entity9 's case , @entity209 spokesman @entity208 said several weeks ago that officials are " continuing to work " on @entity25 's behalf " through counselor and diplomatic channels			1
" on wednesday , @entity8 's interview with @entity171 was ended abruptly after @entity8 asked whether @entity9 felt that he was in danger			1
@entity25 : " @entity219 ... the guards are telling me i have to go now			0
but thank you for your ... for your call			0
" @entity8 : " is there anything you want people to know before you go ? " @entity25 : " i am 100 % innocent of the crimes i 've been accused of , and i ca n't wait to see my family			2
and i thank everyone for all their support and their effort			0
