fevered efforts by @entity3 to capture the embattled @entity5 city of @entity6 have handed @entity7 and allied forces a prime opportunity to deal the extremist group a bloody nose , the @entity1 's top general told reporters friday			1
by pouring what gen. @entity14 described as " legions " of fighters into the city , @entity3 commanders have given allied warplanes numerous targets to attack			1
" the more i attrit him there , " @entity14 said of @entity3 , using a common military term for grinding down an enemy 's power , " the less i 'll have to fight him on some other part of the battlefield			0
" the @entity7 military carried out seven airstrikes in northern @entity5 and coalition aircraft carried out two more near @entity32 , north of @entity33 in @entity34 , the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) said on friday			1

the strikes brought the number of missions flown against targets in the city to 129 , by @entity53 's calculation , the most of any town in the three - week - old @entity5 portion of the fight against @entity3			0
@entity14 said friday that the increased number of airstrikes near @entity6 are n't due to a change in attitudes , but rather the presence of so many @entity3 targets as the group fights @entity5 @entity83 fighters for control of the city			1
