-- a 36 - year - old man goes out with some friends			1
they hit a handful of bars			1
the 36 - year - old has some drinks			1
at the end of the night last may , as the last bar closes , he decides to slide down the railing of the stairs heading out			2
he loses his balance and falls backward			2
he dies from a skull fracture			0
his blood alcohol level was .25 , more than four times the @entity17 threshold			1
who 's responsible ? before you answer that , let me tell you another story			0
last april , a man goes out drinking with friends to celebrate his 21st birthday			1
he ends the night at the same bar the 36 - year - old ended his last night at			1
as life would have it , he , too , decided to slide down the railing			0
he , too , lost his balance			0
he , too , fell back four stories			0
the death certificate stated " acute ethanol intoxication " played a role in his death			0
in 2009 another partying 21 - year - old fell to his death in that same stairwell			2
now who do you think is to blame , the bar or the patron ? because the stairwell was up to code , i believe the fault lies with the patron			2
the @entity47 is going after the bar			0
last week at a state hearing , officials recommended suspending the liquor license for 10 days for the @entity53 , @entity47 , four - story , 70,000 - square - foot multi-venue entertainment hub affectionately known as @entity54 ( short for @entity55 )			0
the punishment is for what officials believe is a culture of over-serving customers , which the bar says it has taken steps to avoid			0
after the 36 - year - old 's death , many in the area went online to point an angry cyberfinger at the bar 's owner for not making it safer for drunk people to slide down railings 40 feet in the air			1
anyone who questioned the decision of the deceased was deemed insensitive			0
much in the same way , some @entity76 were upset there were n't more lifesavers along the city 's river , after a drunk man hopped a fence , ignored the " park closed " signs , fell into the icy waters and died			2
why did he venture out to the slick and slushy banks during what has become the coldest @entity90 winter in 30 years ? to retrieve a dropped cellphone that landed on a broken shard of ice			0
a friend he was with also died that night trying to save him			2
these are all sad , tragic stories			0
but they come with the territory			0
@entity99 was repealed in 1933 because we the people wanted the freedom to drink			2
and as with all freedom there exists the burden of personal responsibility			0
we have age restrictions , we severely punish law breakers , we educate consumers and make public service announcements like " @entity111			0
" yet nearly 90,000 people still die from excessive drinking every year , according to the @entity114			1
what are we gon na do ? go back to @entity99 -- because you know , the war on drugs is so successful ? -- or recognize government can detour behavior but it ca n't legislate away stupid			1
case in point : the @entity124 pastor who starred in a reality tv show about snake - handling in church who died last week from a snakebite			0
so if you 're the kind of person who thinks it 's cool to drink large quantities of alcohol out of a toilet -- which one participant in the social media drinking game " @entity139 " was photographed doing -- i 'm more prone to give you the side - eye than blame @entity142			1
nonetheless , because at least five people have died playing the game , @entity142 was compelled to issue a statement which read in part : " we do not tolerate content which is directly harmful , for example bullying , but behavior which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules			1
" which sounds reasonable to me but was n't enough for dr. @entity154 , a medical adviser for the @entity156 - based charity drinkaware			2
she said @entity142 should remove the videos , noting " if the thrill was n't there , your mates were n't seeing you , i expect it would very rapidly fizzle out			1
" she 's right in that @entity139 -- a game in which players post video of themselves drinking a large amount of alcohol while doing something crazy and then challenge friends to outdo them -- may lose popularity in its current incarnation			1
but as the recent tragedies in small cities like @entity53 and large ones like @entity90 point out , @entity139 is n't the issue			2
the issue is n't alcohol			1
while i understand the desire to want to save everyone from themselves , i also understand that we ca n't			1
alcohol is legal , and every year tens of millions of people consume without incident			1
and every year tens of thousands of people die of an alcohol - related death			1
some as innocent victims , some because of addiction and some because of a bad decision			0
that 's the deal we made back in 1933 , and i doubt we 'll go back			0
one of the @entity139 participants drank alcohol mixed with motor oil			2
@entity201 oil ! i refuse to make that @entity203 's fault			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : alcohol kills tens of thousands of people a year
he says some blame @entity142 for *spreading* word of a deadly drinking game
bars also take the blame for people who consume too much alcohol and take risks , he says
@entity206 : the *problem* is that we ca n't save everyone from themselves
