what did the @entity1 government know about the mass abduction of schoolgirls by @entity6 militants , and when did it know it ? those are the tough questions being asked after an explosive report made public friday accused @entity1 military commanders of knowing the terror group was on its way to raid a boarding school in the town of @entity15 at least four hours before 276 girls were abducted			1
the findings by human rights group @entity18 echo accounts of a number of the parents and villagers , who have described to @entity23 an ineffective military response in the days and weeks after the girls were abducted			1
president @entity27 's government vowed to investigate the allegations even as it defended its military response and questioned the motive behind the accounts			1
" this is really outrageous , unbelievable , " minister of information @entity32 told @entity23			0
the moment the @entity1 government heard of the abduction , " we went in to action , " @entity32 said			2
" ... we should n't turn this into a trial of the @entity1 government			2
" even as he vowed an investigation into the claims , @entity32 said it was " inconceivable " that soldiers on duty would not respond to a potential attack on a school			1
hours after @entity1 's defense ministry dismissed the report 's findings as " unfortunate and untrue , " the country 's minister of state for defense vowed to get to the bottom of the allegation			1
" we must investigate and ensure we get to the root of it , " @entity54 told @entity23			0
" and any necessary actions will be taken to ensure such a thing does n't reoccur			0
" ' no reinforcements ' scrutiny of the government 's response has escalated amid international outrage over the mass abduction , with many asking why @entity1 did not mount a larger response or ask for international help			1
the @entity18 report alleges that after @entity1 commanders were informed of the pending attack , they were unable to raise enough troops to respond			1
the commanders left a contingent of between 15 and 17 soldiers and a handful of police officers in @entity15 to fend off the militants , the group reported			0
" when it was clear these girls had been abducted , no reinforcements were sent to the town , " @entity79 , a researcher with @entity18 , told @entity23			1
the report was based on the reports of more than a dozen people , including two senior @entity1 military officials , who gave varying , but consistent accounts , @entity79 said			2
but @entity1 's defense ministry disputed the findings , saying the first word received was of an ongoing attack at @entity15			1
the troops " did not receive four hours forewarning about the attacks , " according to a statement released by maj. gen. @entity97 , a ministry spokesman			0
" rather , they received information of an ongoing attack on @entity15 from troops on patrol " who saw the attack and took on the militants			0
@entity107 state sen. @entity106 said friday that the military sent reinforcements , but not until the militants were already in @entity15			0
' the soldiers were not there ' as many as 200 @entity6 fighters carried out the @entity15 school raid , @entity18 reported , herding the girls out of bed under the cover of darkness after a firefight with the handful of security forces in the town			1
the @entity1 government has claimed it responded , with troops , helicopters and airplanes in the immediate aftermath of the mass abduction			2
but the father of two of the girls taken told @entity23 there has been little sign of military help			0
he said first learned of the attack in a telephone call from a friend in @entity15 , who told him the town was under attack by @entity6			1
" pray for us , " the friend told the father , whose identity is being withheld out of a fear of possible reprisal by @entity6 and the government			2
the next day , the father learned his daughters and three nieces had been snatched			0
he and his family sought out the help of the military in the area			0
but , he says , " the soldiers were not there			0
" days later , a meeting was called by the elders of @entity15			0
" they said the army will be there and a civilian detail will be there -- to accompany us into the bush " to search for the girls , he said			0
but no military or government officials showed up , he said			0
up to 21 days , nothing has been done , " he said			0
' unfair ' criticism @entity1 officials have frequently been criticized for failing to prevent @entity6 's deadly attacks , particularly in the terror group 's stronghold of northeastern @entity1			1
@entity174 , the minister of state for defense , called the criticism " grossly unfair			1
" at least 2,000 people have died in violence in northern @entity1 this year alone , @entity18 said			1
the most recent @entity6 attack killed at least 310 people in a town that had been used as a staging ground for troops searching for the missing girls			1
@entity185 and @entity186 officials have arrived in @entity187 to supplement a @entity185 team already on the ground there , according to officials			1
they will help @entity1 's government look for the missing girls , plan rescue missions and advise on ways to subdue @entity6			1
" this is n't time for a blame game			0
we are happy help is coming , " @entity54 said			0
@entity185 officials , at least , say they are unlikely to commit troops to combat operations			2
and it 's unclear if @entity1 would allow @entity185 or @entity186 troops on the ground			1
" we know the experiences the two nations are bringing to the table , and we intend to ensure that that wealth of experience is " used to bring about an end to the situation , @entity54 said			0
' many soldiers are afraid ' according to @entity18 , civilian officials in a nearby town and leaders of an armed vigilante group organized by the military informed nearby military posts that armed militants had passed through on their way to @entity15 hours before the april 14 assault on the boarding school			1
the human rights group said an official in the village of @entity226 told its investigators that residents had spoken of strangers who passed through on motorcycles , saying they were on their way to @entity15			0
the group cited another official as saying the men had asked herders for directions to the school			0
the group also cited unnamed senior @entity1 commanders as saying they were aware of the attack even before the calls from the civilian leaders and vigilante groups			1
but they were n't able to muster enough troops to respond , @entity18 cited the commanders as saying			2
" there 's a lot of frustration , exhaustion and fatigue among officers and ( troops ) based in the hotspots , " @entity18 quoted one of the unnamed commanders as saying			2
" many soldiers are afraid to go to the battle fronts			0
" where are the girls ? @entity6 's leader , @entity260 , took credit for the mass kidnappings in a video that surfaced this week			1
he said he planned to sell the girls into slavery			0
a few escapees shared harrowing tales of escaping into a nearby forest			0
@entity185 navy rear adm. @entity269 , who serves as @entity271 press secretary , said officials believe the girls " have been broken up into smaller groups " but declined to detail how they came to the conclusion			2
his sentiment has been echoed by others			0
" the search must be in @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285 , to see if we can find information , " said @entity278 , a former @entity186 prime minister and the @entity280 's special envoy for global education			1
but @entity27 believes the girls are still in @entity1 , somewhere in the @entity290 forest			1
" if they move that number of girls into @entity284 , people will see			0
so i believe they are still in @entity1 , " he said			2
international outrage has escalated over the nation 's largely ineffective effort to subdue @entity6			2
@entity18 is not the first to accuse @entity1 of failing to take enough action to stop the @entity15 raid or other attacks , or to stage a forceful enough response in the aftermath			1
@entity27 waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter			2
he said that rescue efforts were under way at the time but that they could not be disclosed publicly			0
" in a hostage situation , time is of the essence , " @entity269 said			0
" we lost some time			0
" international response the international effort to buttress that fight ratcheted up friday with the arrival of @entity185 and @entity186 advisers			1
six @entity185 military advisers arrived friday , a @entity185 official told @entity23			2
they will join a team of @entity185 and @entity186 officials already in @entity1 , helping find the girls , planning rescue efforts and devising strategies to help subdue @entity6			1
a @entity186 team drawn from the country 's @entity327 , the @entity328 and the @entity329 also arrived in @entity187 on friday , the @entity186 foreign office said			1
@entity330 also said it is sending a team but did n't provide specifics on what expertise it will bring			0
@entity186 satellites and advanced tracking capabilities also will be used , and @entity337 has promised to provide any intelligence gathered by its satellite network , @entity1 said			1
there are no plans to send @entity185 combat troops , @entity269 said .			2

" we must investigate " the claims , @entity1 's minister of state for defense says
@entity27 believes the girls are still in the @entity1 , despite @entity185 *assessment*
@entity1 forces had warning of @entity6 attack on school , @entity18 says
@entity185 and @entity186 teams arrived to help @entity1 plan the fight against @entity6
