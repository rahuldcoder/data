@entity0 , @entity1 -- part of the fence separating the @entity5 and @entity1 sits about 50 yards away from hundreds of tunnel - like holes and makeshift tents where people live , stuck between two countries			1
trash surrounds the area , driven there by the sewage that runs through the nearby @entity14 channel			1
the odor of rotting food and feces oozes from the ground ; the warm weather and hot sun worsen the smell			0
the stench makes it hard to breathe , and it 's harder to fathom how any human being could live in these conditions			1
yet , an estimated 4,000 people call this place home , a stretch known as " @entity31 , " or " the border , " wedged along the @entity5 - @entity1 border			1
it 's inside @entity1 , just outside the city limits of @entity0			1
with a disheveled shirt and shorts covered in dry gray sludge , @entity36 smiles and points towards the fence , signaling the location of the place he once called home			1
he has n't seen it in three years			1
" i am heading back there and nowhere else			0
there is no way in hell i am staying here , " @entity46 said			0
life on the border is complicated @entity46 and the others living in @entity54 are stuck in between two countries and their laws			1
he has nowhere to go and no place to call his own			0
@entity46 was born in @entity1 , and 25 years ago he illegally immigrated to the @entity5 , the country where he worked and prospered , where his children were born , educated and given better opportunities			1
@entity46 was sent back to @entity1 in 2011 , one of 2 million people who have been deported since president @entity63 took office			1
last year , @entity65 removed close to 369,000 undocumented immigrants -- most from @entity1 and @entity67 -- from the @entity5			1
about 40 % of those deported were sent back through the @entity69 in @entity0 , according to @entity1 's @entity70			1
opinion : why i fasted for immigration reform they arrive in @entity1 with no form of identification , no money and often only the clothes on their backs			1
most of those deported have no connection to @entity0 , no family or friends , and some can barely speak the language			1
that was the case for 37 - year - old @entity87 , who was in the @entity5 legally just last week			1
he grew up in @entity88 , having arrived in the @entity5 with his parents when he was 4 years old			1
his mother and father came in illegally , but as an adult , @entity87 got a green card , a four - year college degree and a job as a computer programmer			1
then he got into trouble , arrested and convicted for drugs and illegal possession of a gun			0
after serving a five - year prison term , @entity87 had his green card revoked just last week , and he was put on a bus and dropped off near @entity0			1
@entity87 has been wandering the unfamiliar streets of this foreign city for days , unable to find food , a job or a place to sleep			0
he speaks so little @entity109 that he 's afraid to ask for directions or help			1
he could n't express in words what had happened to him : in the space of one week , he had gone from @entity5 resident to citizen of no - man 's land			1
" it just feels the gate itself is so far away , even if i 'm standing right next to it , " @entity87 said , staring at the border separating him from the @entity5			1
living in a hole in the ground @entity46 has been in @entity54 long enough that the others call him " @entity126 , " a reference to his wild , curly hair			1
he has n't had a haircut in years			2
his home , as he calls it , is n't much of a home but rather a deep hole in the ground cleverly built with trash and dirt			2
shoestrings and pieces of clothes keep the wooden sticks and plywood together			0
the roof is the most impressive			0
" see , it 's pretty strong , " @entity46 said as he jumped on it			2
he seems to be proud of his efforts and shows off his construction skills , gained over years of working in @entity147 as a laborer			0
he and three other men helped built it			0
deportations split families since his deportation in april 2011 -- the result of a traffic stop -- @entity46 has lived in the slums of the @entity14 canal			0
he arrived with nothing but the clothes he was wearing			0
returning to his home state of @entity161 was not an option			0
after having lived in the @entity5 for 25 years , @entity46 had a home , a job and , most important , a family : a wife and four children , all @entity5 citizens			1
@entity46 does n't care to stay in @entity1 , and he quickly learned that @entity1 did n't care for him to stay , either			1
according to him , police in @entity0 assume that all deportees are criminals and drug addicts and consider them all a nuisance			0
the police constantly harass them for no reason , he says			0
the deportees have to hide underground to evade local authorities , and for them this is the safest place in @entity0			0
" i feel a lot worse here			0
discrimination is a lot worse here			0
i am in my country , and they discriminate against me a lot worse			0
i ca n't even walk the streets			2
instead of having laws that protect us , they make life even harder for us			0
i do n't like it at all , " @entity46 said			2
a recent study conducted by @entity193 , a research center focused on regional issues at the border , found that 96 % of the residents of @entity54 have been arrested by @entity0 police officers , 70 % more than once			1
@entity0 police would n't officially comment on the situation at @entity54 , but they have openly called the deportees " criminals " and a public health threat to the city			1
' no human being should live like this ' unwanted by the @entity5 and @entity1 , this is the place where thousands have found refuge while they save up enough money to cross back into the @entity5			1
" it 's a no - man 's land			1
@entity1 does n't want you , and the @entity5 sure as hell does n't want you , " said @entity213 , an activist and deportee who lives in a shelter outside @entity0 and advocates for those living in @entity54			1
" no human being should live like this			2
" @entity213 , a @entity222 veteran , had his green card revoked and was deported in 2004 after being convicted of a felony for shooting an illegal firearm			2
he has struggled to get back on his feet , but that has n't stopped him from helping others			2
the fluent @entity230 speaker now counsels other newly arrived deportees and has joined other activists in @entity0			0
he says the local government offers little to no help to the new arrivals , and so he and other activists try to help with food and shelter			0
" they look at you as a criminal , a drug addict and stuff like that , " @entity213 said			0
" when you get here , you come with nothing , so you probably spent four or five days in detention			0
you do n't have money to buy a shaving kit or whatever			2
you look like you 're homeless			0
the government does n't have nothing in place for nobody			2
" he does n't hide the fact that some of the deportees living at @entity260 are heroin addicts			2
and he does n't need to			2
you ca n't walk through @entity54 without seeing the open usage of heroin , the dirty needles stuck behind ears like pencils and , more horrifying , others sharing them on the filthy concrete			1
one of the users is @entity271 , wearing his home city 's baseball team on his cap : the @entity275			2
" my home is in @entity88 , " he proudly proclaimed			0
as we talked , @entity271 's eyes started to lose focus , his words beginning to melt into each other			2
" are you high ? " i asked			0
" yeah , " he said sheepishly , like a child caught eating too much candy			0
" why do you do the heroin ? " " why ? i have no place to go			0
where ? " he responded with finality			0
in @entity294 , the issue of how to deal with 11 million undocumented immigrants is at the core of the immigration debate			2
and no one seems to have the right answer on what to do			0
there 's absolutely no discussion about what to do about the deportees , from either @entity5 or @entity1 authorities			1
@entity305 says ' never mind ' on immigration back at @entity54 , @entity46 wastes no time counting down the days until he returns home			1
unfortunately , @entity46 's return to the @entity5 will probably be made via some form of an illegal entry , just like the first time he crossed over from @entity1 25 years ago			1
" i am just waiting for the right time to leave , just the right opportunity to cross over			0
the situation here is no good			0
" @entity2 's @entity317 contributed to this story			2
