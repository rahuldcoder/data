@entity0 -- traversing @entity0 's highways as a bus driver has always been a dangerous job , says @entity5 , whose route takes him from central @entity0 to @entity8 , on the border with the @entity10			1
" but never like now , that i can assure you , " said @entity5 , who has been a driver for three years			2
his view coincided with other bus drivers who spoke with @entity14 , who drive through drug cartel territory , and asked for anonymity because of fear of retribution for speaking on the record			1
assaults , armed men , crossfire , bodies or human heads on the side of the road , form part of the daily stories that drivers have told each other in the past two years			1
it is a reality that came to light with the discovery last month of mass graves in the town of @entity35 , @entity8 , that possibly contained the bodies of kidnapped bus passengers			1
in addition to the development of kidnappings and assaults of passengers , bus drivers are extorted so that they may transit freely on the highways			1
" in some places these people ( drug cartels ) ask for money in exchange for our security			1
... they ask us for money to supposedly travel safely on the roads , " said another bus driver			1
how much money do they demand ? " from 200 to 1,000 pesos ( $ 17 - $ 87 )			2
" what guarantees are there that with that they will leave you alone ? " there is no guarantee , but there is nothing we can do when they arrive with a gun , intimidate you , and tell you they belong to this or that criminal group			2
" " suddenly , on the street , they watch us , they arrive in trucks , it 's easy to recognize us because of the uniform , " the driver continued			0
" they approach and say , ' i come from this place and belong to this group			0
we are asking for your cooperation , or else there will be problems -- consequences			0
" @entity89 , a bus driver with 10 years of experience , said that in his travels through @entity8 , he has been witness to armed confrontations between police and traffickers , and in more than one occasion has seen bodies strewn or mutilated on the highways			1
one time , he had to maneuver his bus to avoid running over two groups who were firing on each other right on the highway			1
" i accelerated and dodged the bullets , " @entity89 said			0
" the passengers were scared			0
some cried , others prayed			0
" " i almost ran over all of them because they passed by running			0
they did n't care about the size of the bus , or about who was on the highway , they crossed it in plain morning			1
we accelerated to avoid that a bullet would hit the bus , " he added			1
in more than a decade of driving through the @entity8 cities of @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and even @entity35 , @entity89 said that he has never seen anything like what he has witnessed in the past months			0
" not even when we had to cross the mountains			0
now , not even the highways are safe , " he said			2
another driver , referring to the kidnapping and apparent killing of bus passengers in @entity35 , said , " we had been witnesses to the violence in the country			2
it touched us , they reached us			0
" government analysts and the country 's @entity136 , posit that @entity8 , like other northern states , two phenomena have converged and resulted in the recent violence : drug trafficking and migration			0
the drivers interviewed agreed that the routes in the north part of the country have become desirable for criminals because a majority of the bus passengers are migrants destined for the @entity10			1
" ( these are ) people who are carrying money or who comes from ( the @entity10 ) with dollars and gifts for their families , " the driver says			0
according to the human rights commission , last year more than 11,000 migrants were kidnapped in @entity0 during their journeys to the @entity10			1
and , according to the @entity160 , in 2010 there were 2,142 robberies on highways in all of @entity0			1
states like @entity164 and @entity8 went from having zero highway assaults last year to 11 and 28 , respectively , so far this year			2
" there were always assaults on the highways , but they were sporadic and another type of crime			2
they were people dedicated to robbery , but not drug trafficking , " said another bus driver , who identified himself as @entity172			2
" we ca n't explain what is happening			0
we suppose that it is the reaction of organized crime to the job the government is doing to eliminate them , but at the same time we see a lot of corruption among the police , " he said			0
" the cities of @entity120 , @entity119 and @entity188 , in the northeast of the country , are the considered the most dangerous routes			1
asked if they want to continue traveling north , a bus driver answers that , " for necessity , for work , by orders , but it is unsafe			1
in a tone of jest they ask us if we are carrying our bulletproof vest and helmet			0
once someone tells you that , you start thinking , ' i hope nothing goes wrong			0

buses traveling through northeast @entity0 face dangerous situations
bus drivers report assaults , crossfire and finding bodies
criminals extort them in exchange for safe passage
