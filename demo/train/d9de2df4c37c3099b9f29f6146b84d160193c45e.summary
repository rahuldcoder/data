-- as my companion and i passed through security on a gorgeous @entity4 afternoon friday , invited by president @entity5 to join hundreds of openly lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender folks at the @entity8 for a reception celebrating @entity10 , i could n't help but reflect back			1
the @entity8 and i go back a long way			1
in the 1950s , as a young gay boy growing up in a small fishing town on the southern coast of @entity15 , i had , for some seemingly inexplicable reason , an intense fascination with all things @entity8 , and especially its occupants , our @entity20 presidents			1
on @entity24 in the third grade , my mom crafted for me a magnificent costume of @entity26 , and i missed that i 'd won a prize because my cotton wig impaired my hearing			0
at major family gatherings , i 'd dress up in what became known as my " presidentials " and entertained relatives by my deft ability to name all the presidents in order , right up to and including @entity37			0
so , the idea of growing up to be president some day was implanted in my head , and it became the source of great consternation for me when , in grad school in the late ' 60s as civil rights , feminist and @entity46 ferment was swelling , i ratified my own commitment to social justice by openly claiming my gay identity			1
i burst out of the closet with a bang , co-founding the @entity52 , @entity15 , chapter of the @entity54 , for one thing			0
but with all that came the sad realization that , alas , i had to completely abandon my dream of ever becoming president			1
still , the @entity8 beckoned me			1
in the mid- 1980s , i had an opportunity to represent an obscure and unhappy publication as its journalistic correspondent in the @entity8 for a few years			1
i leaped at the chance , moving across the @entity20 to be there , in the press room , almost daily			0
i did n't like who i worked for and i did n't like who was president at the time , but i loved the @entity8 , especially on the few occasions when i was included among journalists invited to one of the many holiday parties held there			1
@entity73 : the secret gay agenda ah , the @entity75 ( where the formal news conferences were also held ) , the @entity77 , the @entity78 and so forth ! all the ponderous presidential portraits and artifacts chronicling the colorful history of the nation 's chief executives			1
but while there , i felt light years away			0
i was gay , and i kept it to myself in those days			0
i was an outsider granted a glimpse of what i 'd cherished so intimately as a youth			0
the idea of being gay was allowed nowhere near the official corridors of power			0
to the gay movement , it was a huge breakthrough when , in the 1990s , a president first uttered the word , " gay , " in a nonderogatory or " as in happy " sense , in a major speech			2
president @entity100 later spoke at one of the first national dinners of the @entity103 in the late 1990s			0
held at a hotel ballroom blocks from the @entity8 , i was there			2
@entity106 for @entity108 people was in the air			0
fast forwarding to last week , it was deeply moving to be back in the @entity8 , finally not as a closeted journalist or anything other than an open and affirming public citizen			2
unlike the @entity108 reception held there just a year earlier , this time there were women and men in military uniform , some holding hands with their same - sex partners , made possible only after the president led the overturning of do n't ask , do n't tell in the course of the past year			2
entering the @entity75 amid cheers to speak to us , president @entity5 reaffirmed the commitment he 'd made only weeks before to full support for gay marriage			2
we have a president now who can say without hesitation , as he did friday , " as long as i have the privilege of being your president , i promise you , you wo n't just have a friend in the @entity8 , you will have a fellow advocate for an @entity20 where no matter what you look like or where you come from or who you love , you can dream big dreams and dream as openly as you want			1
" thank you , mr. president : you mean those kind of " big dreams " i had as a kid ! there is no doubt in my mind now that there is some @entity108 youngster in our land right now who will grow up to become president of the @entity20 some day			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

as a child , @entity159 was fascinated with @entity8 and presidents
he gave up his dream of running for the presidency when he came out
@entity159 was invited to attend friday 's @entity8 reception for @entity169
he says it 's now possible for a gay *person* to think realistically of running for president
