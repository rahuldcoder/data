-- if @entity2 end this season with a first @entity4 since 1990 , then perhaps the club can look back to a hand dealt by fate on april 6 , 2014			1
multiple hands , in fact , and some arms -- as @entity8 ' team returned to the top of the @entity11 table with a controversial 2 - 1 win at @entity13			1
first the outstretched limb of home defender @entity18 , seeking to stop the progress of @entity20 , allowed @entity2 captain @entity21 to put his team ahead from the penalty spot			1
then the flailing hand of former $ 50 million @entity27 flop @entity25 clouted the head of @entity29 at a corner			1
as an encore , he knocked the visiting goalkeeper 's arm away from the ball , allowing @entity36 to equalize in stoppage time			2
referee @entity38 overruled his linesman , who had flagged for a foul by @entity25 -- much to the anger of the @entity2 players watching the replay on the big screen at @entity45			1
if @entity38 got that wrong , he made up for it in the second half by awarding @entity2 another penalty which @entity21 again converted			1
@entity13 keeper @entity49 had appeared to make contact with the ball with his outstretched hand before the onrushing @entity53 sprawled to the grass			2
@entity8 , however , believed the official got that one right			0
" the first penalty was clear and i thought the second one was a penalty as well , " the @entity2 manager said			2
" @entity53 gets a touch on the ball and touches it past the goalkeeper			0
the keeper gets a touch on the ball , but also takes him			0
" @entity13 counterpart @entity66 , whose team remained mid-table and seemingly safe from relegation , was less impressed			1
" @entity53 is going down before @entity49 plays the ball , " he said			0
" ( the ref ) thinks @entity49 has n't played the ball and he has			0
" i feel let down , the lads feel really let down			0
we took @entity2 right to the wire			2
" and that is where the title race appears to be headed , with five rounds remaining for most teams			0
@entity2 , four points clear of third - placed @entity79 having played two games more , will face a big test of their aspirations when the two teams meet at @entity84 next sunday			1
the @entity27 then go to struggling @entity85 before hosting @entity86 , second in the table at the end of this weekend -- two points adrift , also with five to play			0
it was @entity2 's ninth successive win , and the club will likely have to beat the record of 12 in a row set back in 1990 to have a chance of denying @entity79 a second title in three seasons			1
" we 'll just keep our focus , keep that concentration			0
it did n't matter that @entity79 or @entity86 won yesterday -- it ca n't affect us , " @entity8 said			0
" we have to control ourselves and our own emotions and get the job done			0
that was a real tough game today , but we got a great result			0
" @entity8 said @entity2 have extra incentive to win the title , with this month being the 25th anniversary of the hillsborough stadium disaster which claimed 96 lives during a crush at the @entity112 semifinal against @entity113			1
" there are 96 people in the sky that will always be supporting this team , " the @entity114 said			2
" we want to do it for the great support and the football family of @entity2			2
if we 're to achieve anything this year , certainly they will always be in our thoughts -- the 96 in the sky and the families that go with them			0
" meanwhile , the race for @entity131 's fourth place in next season 's @entity132 turned in @entity135 's favor on sunday as @entity2 's city rivals thrashed the incumbents @entity138 3 - 0			1
strikers @entity139 and @entity140 scored before former @entity135 favorite @entity141 netted an own - goal , putting @entity144 's team just a point behind the @entity146 with a game in hand			1
" the implications today were quite unique			0
we were hoping for a result but what was needed today was breaking many barriers , " said the @entity151 manager , who has impressed since taking over after @entity152 left to join @entity153			0
" in 22 games we have played against @entity138 we only scored one goal or less : today we kept a clean sheet and scored three and looked like we could have scored more			2
" the performance had an arrogant focus which was very pleasing to see			0
" @entity162 , whose team had topped the table for large parts of this season , admitted @entity138 's morale was flagging after some heavy away defeats against the leading teams			1
" they have taken something of our charisma from the team			2
is that belief ? is it fear ? is it confidence ? " said the @entity176 , who has guided @entity138 into @entity178 's top competition for 16 successive years			1
" i would n't question the spirit of this team			2
they are focused and want to do well but they have lost something on the confidence front			0
" @entity85 sacked manager @entity187 on sunday after the 1 - 0 defeat by @entity189 left the club one place above the relegation zone , but five points clear of the bottom three teams			1
the club 's under - 18 team coach @entity195 was appointed to take the place of the former @entity199 player until the end of this season .			1

sunday 's 2 - 1 win at @entity13 puts @entity2 back on top of @entity11
captain @entity21 scores two penalties in team 's ninth successive *victory*
