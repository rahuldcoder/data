the train was going 153 kph ( 95 mph ) when it derailed , the superior tribunal of @entity11 said			1
that 's nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened			1
authorities have charged the train 's driver , @entity17 , with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness			1
a court has granted @entity17 conditional release , but his license to operate a train has been suspended for six months			2

@entity32 efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful			0
@entity3 train crash victims mourned at memorial mass the train , nearing the end of a six - hour trip between @entity38 and @entity39 , derailed wednesday evening as it hurtled around a bend in @entity41			1
minutes before the derailment , @entity17 received a call on his work phone , apparently receiving instructions on the way to @entity39 from a @entity49 staff member , the court said tuesday			1
background noise suggested he was looking at or shuffling papers , the court said			2
on @entity3 's railroad system , command and control posts can communicate with drivers at any point during a journey , a spokeswoman from @entity49 -- the @entity3 railroad company -- told @entity32 's @entity60			1
drivers communicate via radio - telephones known in @entity3 as " tren - tierras " or train - to - land			1
but drivers also use mobile phones if radio - telephones are not working or " when it 's considered necessary , " the spokeswoman said			0
@entity66 , a railroad transportation expert at @entity68 's @entity67 , said he was stunned by the report that the driver may have been speaking on the phone shortly before the crash			1
in the @entity73 , @entity66 said , railroad drivers are not allowed to use cell phones to prevent dangerous distractions			0
shortly before the train crashed , according to reports , the @entity3 train had passed from a computer - controlled area of the track to a zone that requires the driver to take control of braking and acceleration , @entity66 said			1
" it 's possible that the driver 's phone conversation -- which apparently was part of his official capacity as a driver -- distracted him and he missed the transition from automatic to driver control , " @entity66 said			1
he may have been unaware he was in control of the train and realized , ' oh , no , we 're headed for a curve			0
' if that 's true , i really do n't think it was his fault			0
" the @entity49 spokeswoman told @entity32 that command and control posts have real - time systems to show each train 's precise location at a given time			2
if this were the case , a controller who would have phoned the train driver might have known the train was approaching a curve			1
according to an interview in state - owned @entity114 news service with the president of the state - owned administrator of @entity117 , the train should have started slowing down about 4 kilometers ( 2.48 miles ) before the curve			0
at 192 kph , the train would have been traveling about 3.2 kilometers a minute			0
he hit the brakes seconds before the crash , bringing the speed down from 192 kph ( 119 mph ) , according to the court			1
he was still on the phone when the train flew off the tracks			2

" our brothers lost their lives ... when they had so many plans , " said archbishop @entity135			0
