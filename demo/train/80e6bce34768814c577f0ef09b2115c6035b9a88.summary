@entity0 -- @entity2 has been playing football since kindergarten , and for the past two years , the 11 - year - old has been knocking opposing players on their butts			1
it never occurred to her that someone might need to protect her from the sport she adores			0
her playing time with the @entity13 ended after last season when the @entity15 enforced its " boys only " policy for football , sidelining the all - star guard and defensive end			1
inspired by her older brother , @entity21 , 14 , @entity2 started playing @entity23 flag football at age 5 and was hooked			1
once she got too big to play @entity23 , she signed up to play tackle football with the cyo in the fifth grade			1
two games into @entity2 's second season , head coach @entity27 received an unexpected call from @entity31 , deputy secretary for catholic education for the archdiocese , who oversees the football program			1
the 5 - foot - 3 , 110 - pound sixth - grader , @entity31 explained to @entity27 , could no longer play for the @entity35 because , according to the @entity13 handbook , football is a full - contact sport -- no girls allowed			2
unaware such a rule existed , @entity27 was shocked , he said			0
" she should be allowed to play , " said @entity27 , who also coaches football at a nearby high school			0
" football is a sport that culls out the folks that can hang or not hang , and certainly , @entity2 has been more than able to hold her own			1
" league of their own not wanting to disrupt the season or ostracize @entity2 , @entity27 and her parents kept the news under wraps and pleaded with the archdiocese to let her finish the season			1
after a week of corresponding with @entity31 , including sending a letter of support from the family 's church pastor , an extension was granted			0
there are 46 football programs , each with junior varsity and varsity teams , under the @entity67			0
of the nearly 2,500 participants , @entity2 is the only female player			2
the coaches waited until the end of the season to tell @entity2 and her teammates that she was off the team because of the archdiocese 's " boys only " rule			1
" i was mad , " @entity2 said after learning she was n't allowed to play , " just really mad that we do n't get the same opportunity as boys just because we 're not a boy			1
" not only am i not going to be able to play , but girls all over are n't going to be able to sign up , " she said			0
" and i do n't think that 's fair			0
" though @entity2 says she 's never been hurt -- and has laid her share of licks on the boys -- the archdiocese said in a statement that the decision to give @entity2 the boot was for her and other girls ' safety			1
" the @entity15 of @entity0 's @entity13 currently designates football as a full - contact sport for boys only			1
it is important to note that most cyo sports are designated by gender , with some sports offering separate leagues for boys and girls			0
these measures are taken in an effort to ensure a safe and appropriate playing environment for all participants , " @entity15 spokesman @entity102 said in a statement			0
" traditionally , football is a boys only sport due to its full contact nature			2
most parents and players have preferred this ; some now disagree			0
an archdiocesan panel of coaches , parents , pastors and experts in the sports medicine and pediatrics fields will evaluate the current rule			0
calls for an immediate change in the policy are premature and unwise without adequate consultation , especially given the potential safety issues involved , " the statement continued			0
according to the archdiocese , budget cuts and personnel changes allowed @entity2 to slip through the cracks , but she actually should 've been denied the opportunity to play when she initially applied in fifth grade			1
she 'll ' knock you on your butt ' when she first stepped on the field , the boys on @entity2 's first cyo team were uncomfortable lining up against a girl , said her former coach , @entity141			1
those concerns dissipated once @entity2 showed she was tough enough to pop a lineman in the mouth just like the rest of her teammates			2
" we did n't make a big deal about it , " said @entity141			0
" anyone who went head - to - head with her ended up on the ground			0
after a week , ( her gender ) was laid to lest			0
" @entity141 , who is also @entity2 's basketball coach and her best friend 's father , said she embodies the character and sportsmanship that football coaches so often strive to instill in their players			1
" this whole fight is for other people more than it is for her , " he said			0
" she 's such a caring , kind , well - rounded young lady who 's able to put a helmet on , throw a switch and knock you on your butt			2
" @entity2 's father proudly stands with his daughter			1
he said the ruling is outdated			0
" girls playing football is not something new			0
they 're not going through uncharted water or pioneering something that has n't been addressed before , " @entity173 said			0
" the sport will determine where 's she 's best able to play , if she is at all			0
" all four @entity179 children are encouraged to pursue their passions , whether it 's theater or football , @entity173 said			2
@entity2 's twin sister , @entity183 , uninterested in playing football , would prefer to remain on the sidelines as a cheerleader			1
tackling the boys - only rule is bigger than just letting her twin back on the gridiron , @entity183 said			1
" she 's trying really hard to let girls play football , " she said			2
" i really like to watch her play , and the rule should be changed so anyone can play			0
" rally ' round the girl after calls and e-mails to the archdiocese were unsuccessful , @entity2 , no longer welcome to play football for the @entity13 , decided to call an audible			1
with the full support of her team , @entity2 's mom , @entity202 , started an online petition at @entity206 to encourage the archdiocese to allow girls to play football			1
her original goal was to get 100 signatures			0
there are now more than 100,000			0
one signer is 9 - year - old peewee football sensation @entity213 from @entity214			2
she was recently featured on a @entity216 box and made a november appearance on " @entity218 , " where she showed off her moves to @entity221 and @entity222			0
she also was invited to this year 's @entity223 in @entity224 , where she blogged for four days for @entity225 , which focuses on female athletes			0
even @entity0 councilman and devout @entity228 fired off an official letter to the archdiocese , saying the issue " hits close to home			0
" " the archdiocese is one of the last remaining defenders of gender discriminating in sports , so let us proudly take a giant leap forward in @entity13 education today by purging this archaic rule from the @entity13 handbook , " he wrote			2
@entity2 also caught the attention of talk show host @entity243			2
sporting her navy and gold football jersey on set , @entity2 won over the crowd during her appearance last month			1
when asked whether she 's gotten hurt , the crowd erupted when she quipped with a made - for - tv smile , " i 've never really gotten hurt , but i have hurt people			1
" could archdiocese cut back ? @entity2 's fight to get back on the field has n't swayed the archdiocese yet , but the panel selected by the archdiocese is expected to issue a decision on the boys - only rule by mid-march			1
in a final appeal , @entity2 , who also competes on @entity13 track and basketball teams , wrote to @entity0 archbishop @entity266 after recently learning he would have the final say after the panel makes their recommendation			1
in an e-mail provided to @entity1 by the @entity2 family , @entity266 told @entity2 he was " perplexed " that she wrote to him only after going to the media			2
" i admire your love of the game , @entity2 , and i 'm impressed by your zeal in pursuing the opportunity to play it , " he wrote			2
" at the same time , it 's important to understand that pressure is not a good way of showing respect for dedicated people who are simply fulfilling their duty to protect young people in sports			2
" the chiding seems to ignore that @entity2 's parents wrote the archdiocese , to no avail , before taking their daughter 's cause public , the @entity286 said			1
though it 's now basketball season for @entity2 , she is n't giving up her fight			1
she 's not being disrespectful when she says the archbishop 's claim that he 's just trying to protect her does n't ring true			1
" i was just really surprised that we 're not allowed to play because we 're girls , " @entity2 said			2
" they say it 's a safety issue , but i do n't get that because it 's not just a safety issue for us ; it 's a safety issue for anybody that goes on to the field			0
