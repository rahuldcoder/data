although it 's been in the works -- and riled alarmists -- for a while , @entity7 's " latch on @entity7 " initiative , which will be put into practice in 27 of the city 's 40 hospitals beginning on september 2 , has caught a recent wave of inflammatory flack among various ' news ' sources , mom bloggers , and more			1
@entity7 's mayor @entity17 announced the initiative shortly after the @entity19 released its new breastfeeding recommendations , which cite an ever - growing body of data supporting breastfeeding 's benefits to babies , moms , and the economy , and stressed hospitals ' important role in this picture			1
his initiative also followed the public appeal of dozens of consumer and health organizations , to hospitals , to stop doling out corporate formula swag bags to every new mom they discharge			1
breastfeeding 's health benefits are indisputable , as are its dismal rates among @entity43 moms			1
parenting.com : 15 toddler superfoods on the up - side , however , studies have shown repeatedly that exposure to information about breastfeeding increases moms ' desire to give it a whirl			2
and early , hands - on support ( followed by a supportive workplace and public sphere ) helps make it really happen			0
since @entity43 health officials hope to almost double the nursing count by 2020 , hospitals seem like the logical place to start			2
it surprises me that @entity63 on @entity7 has received such vocal criticism			2
and frankly , much of the recent criticism is based more in the alleged " @entity66 " and their crossfire than in , you know , reality			0
more on that in a minute			0
first , here 's the latch on @entity74 : in addition to a pro-breastfeeding public transport poster campaign ( not the first in the country by any means ) , voluntarily complying hospitals will : - enforce the @entity7 state hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula unless medically indicated and documented on the infant 's medical chart - limit access to infant formula by hospital staff - discontinue the distribution of promotional or free infant formula - prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula advertising or promotional materials in any hospital location what this means is : nurses must document the dispensing of formula to new moms , citing a medical reason for its necessity			1
@entity104 nurses will need to actually talk with new moms , and provide them with information and support in trying to breastfeed before they hand out formula			2
given the difficulty i had in getting any breastfeeding support after my @entity7 hospital delivery , i would have welcomed some policy backing my requests			1
but for new moms who just plain do n't want to breastfeed , this definitely represents a change of tides ... not by much , though			2
no one will be forced to breastfeed if they truly do n't want to , obviously			0
parenting.com : best cities for families this policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable , rather than to condemn women 's choices			2
in fact , the initiative clearly states that " mothers who decide to formula feed and can not afford formula will be referred to @entity133 ( @entity133 ) , a food and nutrition program for low - income families			1
" i.e. the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but ca n't afford to buy it			2
this is hardly an anti-formula - feeding campaign			0
( but it definitely is a pro-breastfeeding one )			0
next up , limiting formula access means only that there 'll be an extra step between a mom delivering her baby and a nurse handing her formula			0
namely , the mom will need to ask for it			0
again , i read this as a way to hold hospitals accountable for attending to each patient personally			0
finally , discontinuing corporate swag ( promotional materials and actual formula ) is a big deal , and a huge step			0
@entity165 's ( of the @entity167 ) opinion that " a mother is n't going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free lanyard or tote bag " notwithstanding , the fact is that corporations are , by definition , the opposite of charitable organizations ; they vie for access to new moms in - hospital because , a ) brand loyalty is not to be underestimated , and b ) mothers assume hospitals have their patients ' ( i.e. the moms and babies they care for ) best interests at heart			1
parenting.com : 36 tips for breastfeeding success so if a given formula is provided -- along with " informational literature " -- actually in the hospital , that formula must be , by affiliation , a baby 's - best - interest choice			1
( it 's a subconscious , logical conclusion			0
) of course babies can , and do , thrive on formula , but there 's no debate in the medical field as to breast milk 's nutritional superiority			2
by providing education and support around breastfeeding , and removing formula manufacturers from the picture , hospitals are actually operating with increased professional integrity ; they are actually providing the best possible care to patients			1
and in some cases , this will mean providing formula to babies ... is it really so horrible that this wo n't come with a bunch of @entity221 from @entity222 ? @entity228 far as the controversy and crossfire is concerned , the @entity167 's @entity165 , despite her anything - but - objective objections to the initiative , made one apt , if obnoxiously - presented , point in her critique			1
@entity231 , of @entity232 , had been quoted in this other @entity167 article , explaining that under the new system , a nurse will need to sign out each bottle of formula issued			0
@entity165 writes , " perhaps @entity231 has never been around a hungry infant , but she should anticipate a cacophony of screams while perpetually understaffed hospitals find nurse 's aides to sign out formula like it 's morphine			1
" while her analogy is rather unhinged , her point about understaffing is important ; i was really kind of freaked out , post-delivery , by how little the nurses seemed to care for -- or even check on -- my well - being			0
when the ' nurse button ' proved pointless , i ended up hobbling down the hallway , barefoot , in search of a glass of drinking water			0
i was , meanwhile , nervous about my own abilities with a newborn , and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room ( something even more urgent than breastfeeding support , which definitely was n't forthcoming ) , there would n't be a good way to get medical help ... in a hospital			2
i know my breastfeeding experience -- and entire post-delivery experience -- would have been improved with better post-natal care , along with one - on - one breastfeeding help			0
@entity275 's initiative , along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success , will hopefully motivate hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their bearings -- around breastfeeding , and otherwise			1
if they do n't , this plan could backfire			2
but if they do , and it succeeds , it could prove to be a positive model for hospitals to follow , nation - wide			0
parenting.com : the most awkward pregnancy photos ever for her part , @entity165 has little else to offer			0
she dubs @entity275 's initiative an " anti-formula crusade " and writes that breastfeeding hardly needs a policy - backed boost , stating , " a mere 50 years ago , 75 percent of @entity43 infants were using formula ; breastfeeding was the odd way to feed a child			1
" true , but fifty years ago -- 1962 -- was not exactly a progressive time in @entity43 history , particularly for women and babies : thalidomide for morning sickness ? @entity313 births ? hello ? @entity165 has cited the least natural point in mainstream @entity43 birth practices as a way to ostensibly ' naturalize ' formula feeding 's prime place in our hospitals today			1
it 's a flimsy argument , and a strange respose to a ( voluntary ) change in policy here in @entity326 who are kicking up ( badly - written , and poorly supported ) dust around latch on @entity7 are fueling negativity for its own sake , as well as divisiveness for the sake of attention ( and page views , which add up to advertising sales )			1
let 's not get sucked in			0
at the end of the day , the post-delivery hospital stay is , under normal circumstances , quite brief			0
a couple of days wo n't keep formula - minded moms from feeding their babies formula			1
but it can make all the difference in getting moms who want to breastfeed onto a successful track			2
and greater numbers of successfully breastfeeding babies will make for a healthier population of babies , and moms , overall			1
this is why @entity275 jumped in to this incredibly controversial territory -- breastfeeding issues and corporate interests in health care ( wow , double - whammy ) -- in the first place			0
getting swept up in demonizing him , or in any uproar around this new policy , distracts from what the initiative really means for new moms ( more support ) and for hospitals ( step it up )			1
it 's going to be okay ! it 's not 1962 anymore			0
what do you think of the latch on @entity7 initiative ? what do you think all the uproar is really about ?			1

@entity7 's latch on @entity7 initiative will promote breastfeeding for new moms
opponents say the campaign creates *obstacles* for mothers who prefer to use formula
the initiative will be put into place in 27 of the city 's 40 hospitals starting on sept. 2
@entity395 's @entity394 says the plan is n't as *restrictive* as some make it out to be
