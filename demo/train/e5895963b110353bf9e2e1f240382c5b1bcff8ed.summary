@entity0 , @entity1 -- half a mile underground , the hollow echo of the @entity1 national anthem rings out			0
and slowly , the red , white and blue @entity1 flag is hoisted up a makeshift metal flagpole			0
these are the opening images of a new , nine - minute video the 33 miners sent saturday from the cavern where they 're trapped 700 meters ( 2,300 feet ) down			1
they were putting a brave face on disaster to celebrate @entity1 's @entity15 in their own way			1
it was left to @entity20 @entity19 , the only one of the men who is not @entity1 , to record an @entity15 message			1
" i would like to send a special message to @entity1 president @entity26 for helping us all in this difficult time			0
i would also like to send a message of thanks to @entity20 president @entity34 who has been supporting my family , " said @entity29 , originally from the @entity20 mining town of @entity31			0
at one point in the video , @entity38 waves a white towel in one hand and his miner 's helmet in the other and demonstrates some nimble footwork as he dances @entity1 's national folk dance known as the " cueca			1
" other miners clap and music plays from one of the mp3 players rescuers have sent into the mine to entertain the men			1
@entity38 jigs around in lightweight rubber boots , a red t - shirt and blue shorts -- items of clothing that were sent down to him and the other miners via an 8 - cm ( 4 inch ) borehole nicknamed the " umbilical chord			1
" the hole was drilled into the mineshaft after they were discovered alive on august 22			0
since then , all emergency supplies , including food , water and clothing , are sent down the narrow shafts			0
the @entity73 mine , in the northern @entity74 , caved in on august 5 and the men were initially feared dead			0
prior to the accident , @entity38 's job was to drive a backhoe , known as a " scoop , " inside the mine			1
since then , he has emerged as a quick - witted joker and has taken the role of narrator in the videos the miners have sent to the surface -- recounting their plight with good spirits and humor			1
at one point , the video shows a live news broadcast projected onto the wall of the cavern where the miners have been holed up and which they have dubbed " @entity96			1
" the news show covered @entity15 celebrations across @entity1			1
the miners now have permanent communication with rescuers on the surface via a telephone line and a fiber - optic cable for video - conferencing			1
a tv signal can be piped into the mine and run through a handheld projector , which beams out a 21 - inch image			0
as a special @entity15 treat , the miners were given a menu of traditional @entity1 " empanadas , " a pastry filled with a mixture of meat , onions , olives and raisins			1
the video showed them receiving the " empanadas " vacuum - sealed in a plastic wrapper and dispatched from the surface in a metal cylinder rescue workers call the " carrier pigeon			1
" on the surface , the miners ' families continue to wait in a makeshift tent village at the mine entrance called @entity132			1
many organized cook - outs -- a typical part of @entity15 celebrations -- and barbecued ribs , filet steak and chicken wings			1
but the family of trapped miner @entity138 said they had little to celebrate this year			2
" we 're sad because @entity15 is a family day and we used to go for a walk with my baby in our favorite park , " said @entity138 's wife , @entity141			1
" but today we 're sad			0
" inside , @entity138 's mother @entity147 prepared broth and chopped salad			2
she said she was sure the miners were just putting on a show for the camera in the videos they had recently sent to the surface			2
she said she believed they were depressed and distraught by their plight			0
" @entity138 's pain is my pain , " @entity147 said			2
" for me , there 's nothing to celebrate			1
it 's just that @entity138 asked us to be together this day			1
as long as they are underground , there 's nothing to celebrate			1
we 'll celebrate independence when they come out			2
" @entity138 , who has a 4 - year - old son @entity168 , has emerged as the poet among the 33 trapped miners			2
he has composed rhymes praising the rescue workers and the valor of his fellow miners			2
" he 's discovered something beautiful down there , " his mother said			2
" he writes letters likes poems			0
" " i guess he 's discovered that talent because he was was in pain being so far from his loved ones , " wife @entity181 said			2
@entity1 president @entity26 is scheduled to visit the @entity73 mine and inspect rescue operations sunday			0
as evening fell saturday , three military helicopters overflew the mine in what government officials said was a " practice run " for sunday 's presidential visit			0
sources among the rescue workers said @entity26 may mark his visit by flipping the switch on a powerful oil drill that has been transported to the mine to assist in the rescue			0
the @entity203 - owned @entity202 drill has been assembled but not yet begun drilling			0
mine experts say that the drill -- known as @entity207 -- could be the fastest way of punching a hole through rock that is wide enough to hoist the miners back to the surface			0
however , two other drills , a @entity214 ( @entity215 ) normally used for boring water holes and a @entity217 950 ( @entity218 ) normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines have been operating for around three weeks			0
on friday , the @entity214 reached a depth of 623 meters ( 2,044 feet ) and penetrated the roof of the workshop area close to the miners ' shelter			0
however , the shaft is only about 12 inches wide and the drill must make a second pass to widen the hole to a maximum 28 - inches ( 70 cm )			0
the @entity1 government says the miners could be rescued by late october or early november , an improvement on earlier predictions that the operation could take until @entity235 .			0

miners put a brave face on a disaster in its 44th day
@entity15 marked by music , dance and empanadas
" for me , there 's nothing to celebrate "
