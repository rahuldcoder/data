-- the @entity2 @entity1 on tuesday fined @entity3 $ 500,000 for failing to assist families following the crash of @entity6 in @entity7 in july			1
the @entity10 airline was slow to publicize a phone number for families , took two full days to successfully contact the families of three - quarters of the passengers and did not contact families of several passengers until five days following the crash , authorities said			0
the half - million - dollar penalty is the first time the @entity1 has issued a fine under a 1997 law that requires airlines to adopt and adhere to a " family assistance plan " for major accidents			1
three of the 291 passengers were killed and scores were injured when the @entity29 struck the seawall at @entity31 and tumbled down the runway			0
" in the very rare event of a crash , airlines have a responsibility to provide their full support to help passengers and their families by following all the elements of their family assistance plans , " transportation secretary @entity33 said in a statement			2
" the last thing families and passengers should have to worry about at such a stressful time is how to get information from their carrier			0
" in the @entity1 order , @entity3 said its job was complicated by the limited number of workers at @entity7 's airport and other circumstances			2
injured passengers were sent to 13 different area hospitals , and there was no list prepared at the time to help the airline track passengers			0
hospitals also were reluctant to release information to the airline due to privacy laws , the airline said			0
@entity3 released a statement after the @entity1 fine was announced saying that it " provided extensive support to the passengers and their families following the accident and will continue to do so			2
" under the @entity72 of 1997 , foreign air carriers assure the @entity1 and the @entity73 that they will adhere to a " family assistance plan " in the event of aircraft accidents resulting in a major loss of life			1
among other things , airlines must publicize and staff a toll - free telephone number to take calls from families , notify families as soon as practical and commit sufficient resources to carry out the family assistance plan			1
according to the @entity1 , @entity3 failed to widely publicize any telephone number for family members of those on board , and the only number generally available to the public that family members could call was @entity3 's toll - free reservations line			1
@entity3 publicized a phone number established by another entity 18 hours and 32 minutes after the crash , the @entity1 said			1
locating this phone number on @entity3 's website required significant effort , the @entity1 said , and the reservations line did not include a separate menu option for calls related to the crash , requiring callers to navigate through cumbersome automated menus			1
@entity3 also took two days to send a sufficient number of trained personnel to @entity7 , and initially lacked an adequate number of staff able to communicate in the languages spoken by the flight 's passengers , the @entity1 said			0
according to the @entity1 , $ 400,000 of the penalty is due within 30 days			0
up to $ 100,000 will be spent on multiple industry - wide conferences and training sessions to provide others with lessons learned from the @entity3 crash aftermath .			0
