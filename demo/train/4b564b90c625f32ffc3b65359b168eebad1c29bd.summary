@entity0 -- when @entity4 's likeness was bumped from the @entity6 £ 5 note in favor of @entity8 , it led to a public outcry and the announcement on wednesday that @entity12 's likeness would be added to the £ 10 note			1
true , the queen , as the country 's monarch , appears on @entity6 bills			0
but historical figures have been included on bank notes for decades			0
the vast majority have been men			0
in the @entity23 , there is no shortage of notable women , but bank notes have n't been updated since 1929 , nine years after women gained the right to vote			1
all of the paper money in the @entity23 features men -- nine presidents , two former treasury secretaries and one @entity32			1
there 's only ever been one woman featured on a piece of paper @entity23 money			1
that was @entity39 , who appeared on the " silver certificates " in 1886 , 1891 , and 1896 , according to @entity41 , a spokeswoman for the @entity42			1
there has never been an @entity44 of either gender			0
@entity0 explained that @entity23 law gives power over the faces on bills to the treasury secretary			1
that 's @entity52 , whose signature is featured on bank notes			0
it 's official : @entity52 's new signature being dead is the only technical requirement to appear on a bank note , but presidents have taken up most of the real estate , although there are exceptions , like @entity32 , the renaissance man and founding father who appears on the $ 100 bill			2
a newly redesigned " @entity32 " with enhanced security features , raised printing and additional colors that shift in the light is set to enter circulation in october			0
but it will keep the portrait of @entity32			0
here 's more from @entity0 's explanation of how the current faces got onto @entity23 dollars : " the figures that currently appear on @entity23 currency were chosen in 1929 when the size of currency was reduced and standardized			1
prior to the adoption of this smaller sized currency , a special committee was appointed by the @entity82 to study this aspect of the design			2
it was determined that portraits of presidents of the @entity23 have a more permanent familiarity in the minds of the public than any others			1
" " this decision was somewhat altered by the secretary of the treasury to include @entity94 , who was the first secretary of the treasury ; @entity95 , who was secretary of the treasury during the @entity96 and is credited with promoting our @entity97 ; and @entity32 , who was one of the signers of the @entity100			0
" records do not indicate the exact reasons why the portraits of these statesmen were chosen in preference to others of equal stature and importance , but all three were well known to the @entity23 public			1
" @entity0 did n't have anything to offer in response to the ascendance of @entity12 to the £ 10 note			1
" in regards to the currency of other countries , we do not comment			2
other countries do what they deem appropriate for their regions and social circumstances , " @entity0 wrote			0
here is more information on currency at @entity42 website			2
currency , it should be said , is distinguishable from coins , which are produced by the @entity129			2
women have a better record when it comes to coins			0
@entity133 was put on the @entity134 - themed quarter in 2003			1
@entity135 , the @entity136 who guided @entity138 on their cross-country expedition , is on dollar coins produced since 1999			1
@entity141 , the suffragette , was on dollar coins produced from 1979 to 1981			1
up in @entity146 , their $ 100 bill is n't paper , it 's some kind of fancy plastic , but it does have a woman on it			0
she 's supposed to be anonymous and represent @entity146 medical innovation			0
but a woman looking into a microscope does bear some resemblance to @entity6 scientist @entity155 , who photographed the dna double helix			0
@entity158 note : there was a @entity155 - themed @entity160 running on thursday , her birthday			2
there does n't appear to be any sort of national movement to put a woman on a piece of paper money , but if there were , who should it be ? leave your suggestions in the comments below .			0

bumping woman from £ 5 note for @entity8 caused outcry , @entity12 on £ 10 note as make - good
in the @entity23 , only woman on currency was @entity39 , on 19th - century silver certificates
@entity133 , @entity135 and @entity141 have appeared on @entity23 coins
the faces currently on @entity23 currency were chosen in 1929
