@entity0 , @entity1 -- police mismanaged a shootout connected to the deaths of four @entity7 , @entity1 , police officers last march , making a series of poor decisions that might have contributed to the record death toll , an independent board says			1
the board this week released a sometimes scathing report that paints a vivid picture of the chaos that descended on an east @entity7 street on march 21 after a convicted felon opened fire on officers during a traffic stop			1
@entity20 , 26 , is accused of fatally shooting two @entity7 patrol officers and fleeing to a nearby apartment building			1
@entity20 then allegedly shot and killed two @entity24 officers who burst into the apartment before police fatally shot him			1
the incident was deadliest in @entity7 police history , the board said			1
the panel , made up of law enforcement experts , said the two officers made a mistake in the traffic stop when both approached the car on the driver 's side			2
that approach violated @entity7 police training procedures and safety practices			1
but the report 's most severe criticism focuses on how @entity7 police handled the surge of 115 police cars that rushed to the scene after the traffic stop			1
" the activities of the 115 @entity51 [ @entity52 ] and outside agency units on scene were disorganized and confused due to poor situational awareness and lack of clear command and control , " the report says			2
some other criticism : none of the highest - ranking officers at the scene took an overall leadership role in the operation , and no command post was set up to efficiently dessiminate information			2
" as a consequence , no one knew who was in charge , adding to the confusion and disorganization , " the report says			0
police leadership violated policy by assembling a swat team from officers on scene instead of waiting for the official special weapons and tactics team to arrive			1
a decision was made to have the ad hoc @entity24 enter an apartment where the suspect was thought to be hiding			0
but the building was not " formally scouted ; no effort was made to ascertain the status of apartment building residents , the apartment building 's interior configurations , as well as individual apartment floor plans , " the report says			0
the swat team entered the apartment without a warrant before hostage negotiators or snipers arrived			0
the team had never trained together and was not ready for the high - powered response it received from the gunman			0
the gunman shot the first two officers who entered the apartment , killing one of them			0
as other officers entered the dimly lit front room filled with children 's toys , the officers were startled to see a woman running at them , screaming			0
" surprised entry team members alerted on her as a possible shooter , but held their fire while they assessed the threat she posed as she ran yelling past them into the outer hallway , " the report says			0
the gunman retreated to a bedroom , where he fatally shot one more officer before police killed him			0
the report praised the officers ' restraint in not shooting the woman who was in the apartment			2
but , in all , the report found 11 things that @entity7 police did well during the incident and 23 things that needed improvement			1
the report will help strengthen the police department , chief @entity133 told @entity2 affiliate @entity135			1
" we will correct those areas that we were flawed in			2
we will improve , " @entity133 said .			0
