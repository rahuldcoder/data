@entity0 -- hot , dry weather returns to @entity4 this week , whisking away the limited relief scattered thunderstorms brought to firefighters in parts of the lone star state over the weekend			1
in a trifecta of potentially bad news for fire crews , the @entity11 said a low - pressure system will push temperatures into the 90s , humidity to 10 % or less and winds up to 45 mph on monday and tuesday			1
the conditions have prompted the @entity19 to issue a red flag warning for a large portion of west @entity4 , urging residents to avoid the use of open flames and to avoid activities that may generate sparks			1
because of the hot temperatures , bone - dry conditions and high winds , " accidental ignitions will have the potential to grow quickly into dangerous wind - driven wildfires , " the weather service said			2
the system will bring with it a chance of precipitation			0
however , rain accompanied by thunderstorms can be a mixed - blessing for firefighters , since lightning can ignite new fires			1
one such fire scorched nearly every inch of a 10,000 - acre north @entity4 ranch , about 70 miles west of @entity46			1
the @entity48 family has raised cattle near @entity50 for a quarter century , but now are coping with the loss of 15 % of its herd and nearly all of its grazing land			0
" its something you ca n't really explain			0
this is home , " @entity57 told @entity1 's @entity58			0
" i know a lot of people think ... it 's just land , but you know this is my backyard and we ran cattle out here since i was a baby			0
" some of the cattle were nearly incinerated by the fast - moving flames			2
all @entity48 can do is number the carcasses with green spray paint , take their pictures and log their gps locations , hoping the family eventually will be compensated for its losses			0
even for the surviving cattle , the road will be tough -- many suffered burns and may have to be put down			0
grazing land has become a precious comodity , with most of the landscape charred following the fire			0
" we 've been really lucky that we have friends all over and people , strangers that come together and donate as much hay as they can , " according to brother @entity48 , who said he 's looking for grass leases to feed his herd until " we can get over this hump			0
" the @entity11 responded to 17 new fires over the weekend , but the blazes were slowed by storms that brought softball - sized hail and reports of tornadoes			1
the largest of these new fires is the pipeline fire in @entity105 and @entity106 counties			1
covering some 7,101 acres , it was caused by an oil well flare			0
@entity110 personnel were involved in the fight against the blaze and it is now 90 % contained			0
@entity115 weather over the past few days helped firefighters maintain control over many of the fires burning in the state , the @entity11 said			1
the largest of them is the 207,660 - acre @entity124 fire in @entity125 , which is 75 % contained as of sunday night			1
firefighters had to abandon the fight against the conflagration in the @entity130 mountains , according to an update from the @entity11 , because of concerns about safety and a lack of reliable communications			1
the agency said the difficult terrain made use of bulldozers impossible and aerial resources had proved ineffective			0
the @entity142 of fires burning west of @entity46 is now 50 % contained , assisted by significant rainfall , the @entity11 said			1
on sunday , crews worked on constructing lines through the 126,734 - acre fire			1
the also burned pockets of vegetation around the fire 's perimeter			0
the 159,308 - acre @entity153 fire in @entity154 , north of @entity155 , is 75 % contained			1
on sunday , crews were able to focus on patrol and mop - up operations , according to the @entity11			2
@entity4 averages nearly 15 inches of rain a year , according to @entity160 , a meteorologist in @entity161			2
over the past six months , just 13 - hundredths of an inch of rain have been recorded in that part of the state			2
while october through march is typically the dry season , that amount of rainfall is far below what it should be , @entity160 said			0
two firefighters have died since the latest outbreaks began , with numerous others injured , state officials said .			2
