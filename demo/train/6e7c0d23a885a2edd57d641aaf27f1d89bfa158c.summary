@entity0 -- @entity3 's new album " @entity4 " has found the light , having earned the operatic soprano a spot on the @entity9 chart for the first time			1
while debuting at no. 151 might not put her up there with @entity13 and @entity14 , a place on the pop charts is a feat for any artist whose album success has mostly been measured on the classical chart ( which @entity3 has topped five times )			1
the new territory could be attributed to @entity3 's radical departure from diva to rocker			1
on the album she trades velvet gowns and soaring arias for freshly cut bangs and covers of songs like indie - rock band @entity33 's " endlessly " and @entity35 's " @entity34			1
" and why not ? " i 've devoted my life to classical music , " says @entity3 , 51			1
" it 's my passion in life and where i 've put all of my effort for decades			2
but i 've always listened to other things and enjoyed other things			0
" with the exception of @entity47 " and @entity49 's " @entity48 , " @entity3 was n't familiar with any of the songs she interprets on " @entity4 " ( @entity46 )			1
they were introduced to her by @entity51 and the @entity54 managers @entity52 and @entity55			0
after listening to the compilation of indie and pop songs they felt would suit her rich , lower register , @entity3 was intrigued			2
" i was absolutely delighted to see how much talent exists in this world			0
[ the music is ] so quirky and eccentric and edgy and sophisticated			0
then there 's the spirit of it : the passion , the anger , the sense of social consciousness			0
" and while eyebrows have risen over one of @entity74 's most beloved sopranos stepping into rock ' n ' roll turf , @entity3 points out that cross-genre admiration is a two - way street : @entity33 frontman @entity78 recently attended one of @entity3 's performances in @entity82 's " @entity81 " at @entity83 in @entity0			1
rock image aside , recording " @entity4 " was a family affair for @entity3			1
her teenage daughters , who were at first appalled to learn their mother was going to take on the likes of @entity89 and @entity90 ( " they said ... ' @entity93 , there 's no way ! ' " ) warmed to the project when @entity3 invited them to sing backup on some of the songs			2
@entity3 's sister @entity98 also joined in			2
in fact you can see the whole family in the " endlessly " music video			0
" we had a wonderful time together , " says @entity3			0
" it was so great			0
they have great taste -- eclectic taste -- in music			0
