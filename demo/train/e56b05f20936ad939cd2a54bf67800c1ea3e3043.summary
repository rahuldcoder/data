after her husband 's failed 2008 run for president , @entity0 said she would never do it again -- until she decided she would			1
and now that @entity5 is in the political fight of his life , @entity0 has become a key advocate and character witness			1
and when he 's attacked , she 's his chief defender -- as this race has become an increasingly personal crusade for a woman who wants the voters to see her husband the way she sees him			1
" his whole life has been a preparation for him being where he is right now			2
his whole life has been an experience of working in very troubled situations , turning around troubled situations			2
his whole life has been in the private economy			1
he understands the difficulties of an economic decline			2
he understands what 's missing in an economic recovery , " she told @entity30 chief political analyst @entity29 in a recent interview in @entity32 , @entity33			1
what questions went unanswered at the first debate ? share your thoughts with @entity40			0
she also stresses , in appearances , the personal side of her husband to try to combat a perception of him as an uncaring , rich businessman			0
" he has a character that is so strong , and is caring , and is good , and is -- he 's just such a good , decent human being , " she said			1
just this week , she headlined events in @entity49 -- near where president @entity50 was preparing for wednesday 's debate -- and outside @entity52			1
her popularity is higher than her husband 's , and she makes sure to do a series of local television interviews at most stops to help spread the message			1
in campaign speeches , she describes how her husband helped those in need or who were sick , including visiting those in the hospital -- even taking their sons with him to help teach them			0
" that is where @entity5 is when someone is in trouble			2
he is by the bedside , " she told a campaign rally in @entity73 , @entity74 , on tuesday			0
she also has encouraged others with personal stories of how he has helped people to share them , a campaign aide confirmed to @entity30			0
@entity0 : ' @entity81 ' is always with @entity5 at the debates since @entity5 is known as someone who does n't like to talk about himself and his record spanning private business and turning around the @entity87 , his wife is trying to fill the void			1
" one thing i know about @entity5			2
... i have seen him be successful in everything he tackles , " she told the @entity74 audience			0
" we 've seen @entity5 do so many turnarounds			2
i am guessing this country is due for a turnaround , and i am guessing there is somebody who knows how to do turnarounds , and his name is @entity5			2
" in light of polls that show a large majority of @entity107 say they do n't believe @entity5 understands the concerns of average @entity107 , one of his wife 's main missions is to convince them otherwise -- especially after the secretly recorded video at a fundraiser where he said 47 % of people would not vote for him because they do n't pay income taxes			1
@entity116 : debates make me nervous " i think the first and most important thing is to recognize is that 's not an accurate perception , that he 's obviously running for 100 percent of the @entity107			0
... this is a guy that does care , that does understand			0
that 's why we 're running , " she told @entity29			0
after the 2008 campaign , @entity0 made a video emphatically telling her husband she would not endure another campaign			1
she , however , changed her mind because she said the state of the economy convinced her he was needed			0
her frustration with some of the recent @entity139 criticism of how her husband 's campaign is being run recently became public			1
when @entity142 asked her what she would say to those critics she responded " stop it			0
this is hard ... you want to try it			0
" @entity0 touts her husband 's softer side she was more cautious in the @entity30 interview			1
" you know , there 's -- there 's always days when you just go -- you know , everyone 's a critic			0
and you just go , ' if -- if you really understood what you 're up against when you do run for president , it 's a very difficult thing , " ' she told @entity29			2
" it 's really hard for a family member , a person that loves this person that you see going through these difficulties , and just -- know , you know -- how tough it is on -- on that person that you love			0
" mrs. @entity0 is also her husband 's major defender			1
originally she wanted to go to back to the press section of the campaign plane to complain to reporters about some of the coverage of his @entity182 trip this past summer , but officials urged her not to do that , campaign aides confirmed to @entity30			0
she makes gentle jabs at @entity50 and his record , such as describing to @entity30 the question people should ask themselves when going into the voting booth : " they should be thinking about , ' have the past four years been good ? do you expect the economy to get better under this president ? or do you think it 's gon na just go on as it has been , just dribbling along ? ' " while she continues to suffer from multiple sclerosis , which was diagnosed in 1998 , it is not stopping her from a vigorous campaign schedule			1
she is expected to be out on the trail constantly between now and @entity201 at rallies , fundraisers and doing television interviews			0
debate advice : @entity50 , light a cig ; @entity5 , throw deep			1
