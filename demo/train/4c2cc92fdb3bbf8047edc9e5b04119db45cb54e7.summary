-- about halfway through the @entity3 review of tv chef @entity6 's @entity5 restaurant , i realized that the author was wielding a meat cleaver			1
maybe it was @entity11 ' description of the chicken tenders as containing a " shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate			0
" or the " ghostly nubs of unblackened , unspiced white meat " in the @entity19			0
or the comparison of @entity6 to the writer @entity23 -- if @entity23 " bleached his hair , drove a @entity20 and drank @entity21			0
" it was at once delicious and stomach - churning -- a perfect reflection of our rip - their - lungs - out culture			1
let 's face it : media meanness sells			1
why slice someone with a surgical precision when you can whack him upside the head with a 2 - by - 4 ? watch : why @entity40 is getting a bum rap from mean folks on @entity43 we 've all enjoyed the guilty pleasure of seeing some author , actor or filmmaker eviscerated for the sheer sport of it			1
good reviews are fine , but what really stirs the water - cooler talk is when the critic draws blood			1
but has this trend gone too far in an age when anyone can instantaneously diss anyone else with a single mouse click ? does it amount to pandering to our collective mean gene ? some public figures revel in the insult wars			1
@entity65 has called @entity66 " a big fat pig , " among other choice phrases , and she 's said he keeps returning " like a raging herpes rash			1
" it 's a cheap way of getting attention			1
and the thing is , it works			0
watch : is it time for @entity74 , gay marriage activist , to leave @entity75 ? the most popular pundits on television tend to be pugilists who draw cheers from their partisans for punching out the other guy 's lights			1
when @entity85 denounces pinheads and loons , his fans eat it up			1
@entity89 caused a furor by calling @entity91 a slut ; he later apologized			1
@entity93 called @entity94 a right - wing slut and did the same			1
@entity96 dubbed @entity97 a racist and his ratings kept climbing			0
nice guys do n't necessarily finish first			0
the virus long ago spread to the political realm			0
watch : why @entity104 and other cranky @entity105 tweet garbage @entity107 congressman @entity107 yelled " you lie ! " during president @entity97 's september 2009 speech to @entity109 on health care and then used the incident for fundraising			1
another congressman , democrat @entity114 , said the @entity116 health plan was to hope that sick people " die quickly " ; he lost the next election but just won his seat back			0
yet another congressman , @entity120 , called his @entity122 colleague @entity121 " vile " and " not a lady " ; he lost his seat during a recount			0
watch : @entity125 and @entity126 -- are the media exploiting the @entity129 tragedy ? the media , without question , reward incendiary soundbites and intemperate language			2
that 's what keeps the bookers calling , and the resulting visibility can prompt donors to keep writing checks			2
maybe @entity43 has played a role in fostering succinct snarkiness			0
everyone tries to break through the static and get retweeted			0
the new nastiness is evident in scandal coverage as well			2
while former @entity148 director @entity147 has largely been portrayed as a flawed hero who made a tragic mistake , many in the media have cast @entity151 as a harlot , using lust to achieve her ambition by bringing down a great man			2
@entity151 , a former senior @entity159 captain , did some dumb things , such as sending harassing e-mails anonymously but does n't it take two to tango ? the same goes for @entity160 , the @entity161 socialite who engaged in voluminous e-mail correspondence with gen. @entity163			0
@entity160 , who volunteered for military causes , is being dismissed in media accounts as a ditzy social climber and worse			2
watch : lasting leak -- why @entity170 's ' gifts ' comments diminish him meanness would n't sell unless there was a market for it			1
maybe watching others get sliced and diced makes us feel better about ourselves			0
maybe it 's just today 's version of bread and circuses			2
and it 's a game anyone can play			2
ever peruse the comments section on major websites ? readers often start ripping each other as morons and dupes within minutes after a story is posted			0
it would be nice if folks with access to the biggest megaphones did n't cater to the lowest common denominator			0
but that 's not the world in which we live			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

@entity203 : @entity3 ' slash - and - burn review of restaurant fed *appetite* for meanness
he says media , politicians take advantage of public 's interest in nasty *attacks*
@entity203 : public figures from @entity65 to *members* of @entity109 revel in nastiness
he says media players such as @entity85 , @entity89 , @entity93 take part
