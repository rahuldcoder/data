@entity2 's @entity1 spacecraft is closing in on @entity4 and its five moons			1
soon we will see what no one has ever seen before : @entity9 , clear pictures of the tiny , icy world			1
" the pictures are what we 're all waiting for , " @entity12 , @entity1 principal investigator , told @entity3			2
up until now , the best images of @entity4 have been a few pixels shot by the @entity17			2
the images , released in 2010 , took four years and 20 computers operating continuously and simultaneously to produce , according to @entity20 of the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			0
they show what @entity2 called an " icy and dark molasses - colored , mottled world that is undergoing seasonal changes in its surface color and brightness			2
" that 's not a very glamorous description , but @entity2 said the images confirmed @entity4 is a " dynamic world that undergoes dramatic atmospheric changes , not simply a ball of ice and rock			1
" @entity1 is aiming its @entity40 ( @entity39 ) telescope at @entity4 to help navigate the final 135 million miles ( 220 kilometers ) of its 3 billion mile journey			1
besides @entity39 , the space probe is packed with cameras and other instruments			0
by mid-may , we should get " better than @entity17 " photos			0
we 'll also see @entity4 's five moons : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
@entity12 expects new " optical navigation images " to arrive any day now			0
" i think of @entity4 as a kind of a @entity57 present that 's been sitting under the tree " waiting to be unwrapped , @entity12 said			1
" i just ca n't wait to see what 's there			0
" @entity1 was launched on january 19 , 2006			2
it will arrive at @entity4 on july 14 , 2015			1
the probe is 27 inches ( 0.7 meters ) tall , 83 inches ( 2.1 meters ) long and 108 inches ( 2.7 meters ) wide			0
it weighed 1,054 pounds ( 478 kilograms ) at launch			0
@entity1 was launched before the big debate started over whether it 's a planet			1
for the scientists on the @entity1 team , @entity4 is very much a planet -- just a new kind of planet			1
" @entity1 is on a journey to a new class of planets we 've never seen , in a place we 've never been before , " says new horizons project scientist @entity70 of @entity71			0
" for decades , we thought @entity4 was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts ; now we know it 's really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the @entity84 , and @entity1 is going to provide the first close - up look at them			1
" some interesting tidbits about @entity4 : -- @entity4 is classified by @entity2 as a dwarf planet			1
-- it has five known moons : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
-- @entity4 is about two - thirds the diameter of @entity93 's moon			1
-- it probably has a rocky core surrounded by ice			0
-- it 's one of a group of objects that orbit beyond @entity100 in the @entity84			0
-- @entity4 is about 20 times as massive than @entity102 , the dwarf planet between @entity103 and @entity104 that will be explored by the @entity105 on march 6 , 2015			2
-- @entity4 has a 248 - year - long elliptical orbit around the sun. -- from 1979 to 1999 , @entity4 was actually closer to the sun than @entity100			2
-- @entity4 was discovered in 1930 by @entity109 at the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			0
-- it was named by 11 - year - old @entity113 of @entity114 , @entity115 .			0

@entity93 's first probe to @entity4 is beginning its long *approach* with the icy world
@entity1 will let us see the tiny planet for the first time ; it will arrive at @entity4 in july
