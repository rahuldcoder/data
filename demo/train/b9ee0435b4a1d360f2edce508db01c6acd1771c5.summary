@entity0 -- with the ringing of bells and bowing of heads monday afternoon , @entity2 marked the passage of a month since the deadliest earthquake and tsunami in its modern history			1
@entity12 monks at the @entity14 temple in @entity0 struck their bells at 2:46 p.m. , the time the march 11 earthquake struck off @entity2 's northern coast			1
the magnitude - 9 quake sent walls of water slamming into the country 's @entity22 shores , sweeping away whole villages and leaving more than 27,000 dead or missing			1
in @entity26 , a fishing village north of the quake 's epicenter , @entity2 troops stopped their ongoing search for bodies , took off their hats and safety helmets and bowed their heads to observe a nationwide minute of silence			1
of the town 's population of 400 , 12 died in the tsunami and 150 remain in shelters			0
" i recalled the relatives i lost in the tsunami , " one woman , @entity40 , told @entity1			0
" i had all those people washed away in my mind when we all stopped			0
" as of monday afternoon , the death toll from the disaster stood at 13,127 , according to @entity2 's @entity48			1
another 14,348 remained missing , and 4,793 were injured			2
in addition , at least two deaths and 283 injuries have been blamed on an aftershock , a magnitude - 7.1 tremor that rattled the islands thursday night			2
@entity2 troops launched an extensive search for more victims in the coastal prefectures of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 over the weekend			1
on monday , another powerful earthquake -- followed by a series of smaller quakes -- rocked northeastern @entity2			1
the jolt from the magnitude - 6.6 quake was felt in @entity0 , about 164 kilometers ( 101 miles ) away , or about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) southwest of the @entity68 nuclear power plant			1
in addition to the devastation that the march 11 disaster unleashed , it also knocked out power to the crippled plant -- triggering a crisis that @entity2 authorities have yet to resolve			1
two explosions , a fire and the continuous pumping of water into the reactors have spread radioactive particles over a wide area of the land and sea surrounding the plant			2
everyone within a 20 - kilometer ( 12.5 - mile ) radius of the plant was ordered to evacuate , and those living between 20 and 30 kilometers were told to stay indoors			2
both the government of prime minister @entity91 and the plant 's owner , the @entity94 , have faced increasing questions over their handling of the disaster but ca n't say at this point when they expect to bring it to an end			1
video taken by a pair of freelance journalists in the town of @entity105 , about 3 kilometers away , showed stray dogs wandering the streets -- and one , horrifyingly , still chained			0
the photographers , @entity109 and @entity110 , gave some of their food to the animal before leaving			0
some of the dozens of @entity105 residents now living in a shelter in @entity116 , north of @entity0 , watched the video and came away convinced they would never return to their hometown again			0
@entity120 was roused to anger when he saw a @entity94 sign touting the " bright future " of nuclear power			0
" that sign was a lie , " @entity120 said			0
" for the last 40 years , @entity94 has only been saying nuclear power is safe , that there 's no chance of a meltdown			0
we -- the people of @entity105 -- feel we 've all been betrayed			0
" but at a news conference monday , @entity132 , @entity91 's chief cabinet secretary and the government 's point man on the crisis , defended authorities ' performance over the past month			2
" i believe we have have done our utmost under the current system in supporting the victims of the earthquake , as well as handling the nuclear power plant situation , " @entity132 said			1
" however , we must not forget people are still suffering , and we must realize what they are going through			0
" ailing @entity146 and @entity1 's @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0
