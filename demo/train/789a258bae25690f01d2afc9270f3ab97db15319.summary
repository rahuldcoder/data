" the focus of the search was 60 to 65 miles off @entity40 , said lt. @entity41 , a @entity41 spokeswoman			2
several aircraft and vessels have joined the search			2
asked about the possibility that the report could be a hoax , given that no one has come forward to identify a family as missing , the @entity8 said that it operates under the assumption that such reports are legitimate			1
