@entity0 -- @entity2 announced last week that it lost $ 2 billion as the result of some complicated trades intended to hedge against economic risk , which according to its top executive is apparently not as bad as it sounds			1
" this is a stupid thing we should never have done , but we are still going to earn a lot of money this quarter			2
it 's not like this company is jeopardized -- we hurt ourselves and our credibility , yes , and we 've got to fully expect that and pay the price for that , " ceo @entity13 said on @entity15 's " @entity14 " on sunday			1
explain it to me : how did @entity2 lose that much money ? to be perfectly clear , @entity2 did not lose taxpayer money			1
it lost its own money			1
still , the news shook up @entity27 and @entity28 with bad flashbacks			2
" well , this is a big surprise because this particular bank is well - respected			2
it is well - led			2
and so , to have this kind of a loss from hedging activities is a big surprise , " sen. @entity33 , @entity34 , said on " @entity35			2
" " i think what it points out that there are no rules of the road for hedging and for derivatives			0
and this needs to happen			0
" after the meltdown three years ago that nearly took the country over a cliff , @entity48 passed @entity53 , a regulatory law to rein in risky investments and prevent the need for future government bailouts			0
writing the regulations has been a ferocious battle , particularly over something called the @entity60 , after former @entity62 chairman @entity61			1
it would ban banks from trading with their own funds			1
worried about damaging the industry 's ability to protect itself and hurting the recovery , the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity27 have been trying to water it down			1
@entity13 , a kind of a shining light in the industry , is a leading opponent of the @entity60			1
@entity76 has been until maybe now			0
sen. @entity77 , @entity78 , told " @entity14 " that the price to be paid " will be that they will lose their battle in @entity0 to weaken the rule			0
that is the real price			0
" if @entity13 has lost his voice , @entity68 have not			1
" @entity91 in mind , the @entity53 bill , 2,300 pages , they 've already had 400 rule - making sessions , and this is where you have so much government regulation coming in that you ca n't see the forest for the trees , " rep. @entity85 , @entity86 , said on @entity88 's " @entity87			2
" it is , as talking head after talking head conceded , very complicated			0
but not all of it			0
" in how we manage that portfolio , we did lose $ 2 billion trading			1
in hindsight , we took far too much risk , " @entity13 said			1
" the strategy we had was barely vetted			0
it should never have happened			0
" unfortunately , the part that is clear is not reassuring			0
