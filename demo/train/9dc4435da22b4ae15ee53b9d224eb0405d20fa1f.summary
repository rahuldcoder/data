during the trial , @entity7 was portrayed as a cold , calculating man who spent the last years of his socialite and megaphilanthropist mother 's life stealing her fortune to line his pockets " these defendants , two morally depraved individuals , preyed on a physically and mentally ill 101 - year - old woman to steal millions of dollars -- dollars that she had intended to go to help the lives of ordinary @entity0 , " @entity22 said , echoing his closing argument to the jury			2

" @entity154 's " today " show weatherman , @entity155 , also came to @entity7 's defense , having met him at his church 10 years ago			1
he argued @entity7 had suffered enough , paying a price greater than any sentence a judge could hand down -- seeing his son turn on him during the trial and being portrayed in a negative light each day			2
" given his advanced age and deteriorating health , justice may be better served by turning a compassionate eye towards this good son , father and patriot and finding it in your heart not to add ' prisoner ' to @entity7 's otherwise unblemished resume , " @entity155 wrote in his letter to the court			1
@entity131 , too , wrote she believed " breaking this man " by putting him in prison was not the right punishment			2
