for a year after her journalist son went missing in @entity2 in 2012 , @entity0 kept calling his cell phone			1
it would ring and ring			2
she would send @entity8 messages on @entity9			1
" it 's excruciating , " @entity0 's father , @entity11 , told @entity12 on monday at their @entity14 home			1
the void of not knowing what happened to their son or who has him is a " constant presence			2
" all they know is that he was abducted in a @entity25 suburb			2
when they try to relax and do something normal in life , some small pleasure , there is an immediate feeling that they should be writing another letter , making another call or searching for some thread they have n't pulled that may be hidden in the extensive notes they 've accumulated over the years they have searched			2
when @entity0 insists that her son will be found , she speaks firmly , her eyes intently fixed , voice firm and clear			2
" there has never been a moment of questioning that he 's coming home , " she said			1
that state of mind keeps despair at bay , and she wo n't waver from faith			2
but could @entity55 , the vicious militant group that has beheaded two other @entity57 journalists , have him ? the @entity59 do n't know for sure , but say they do n't think that 's the case			1
there has been no communication or ransom requests from the captors to the @entity65 -- a tactic @entity55 has previously used in the abductions of other journalists			0
that is what leads the @entity70 to believe @entity55 does not have their son			0
even contemplating a scenario like that is unbearable to them			0
" if we start thinking about that ... the pit of despair has no depth , " @entity0 said			0
" it 's an abyss			1
" video of @entity82 only one clue has emerged since the disappearance of the 33 - year - old , who is also a former @entity87 captain			0
a shaky 47 - second video uploaded to @entity89 in september 2012 showed him blindfolded , apparently being walked through rocky terrain by men carrying guns			1
at that time , the @entity94 said @entity0 was believed to be in the custody of the @entity2 government -- but the regime of president @entity98 did not say it was detaining him			1
his parents said this week that they 've been told by the @entity2 government that their son is not in its detention facilities			1
@entity0 was freelancing for @entity102 and the @entity103 , filing stories for them starting in may 2012			2
his @entity106 posts and pictures on the photo - sharing site @entity108 drew thousands of followers			0
in july 2012 , @entity0 appeared on @entity12 's " @entity110 " to talk about what he saw in @entity2			1
he was then a law student and spending his summer reporting on the war			0
he described being embedded with a rebel group fighting to oust @entity2 president @entity98 and seeing that the government 's helicopters fly so high it seemed impossible that fighters could aim their missiles			1
he also said that he witnessed hostile fire that seemed random and badly aimed from @entity98 's tanks and troops			2
he was last publicly heard from via @entity106 on august 11 of that year , saying that he spent the day with @entity126 rebels who were fighting to oust @entity98 from power			0
@entity0 tweeted that he enjoyed a good time at a pool party			0
" they even brought me whiskey			0
hands down , best birthday ever , " he posted			0
parents on a mission the @entity59 have traveled , at their own expense , to @entity137 to meet with people who they felt might help them find their son , they told @entity12			1
they made three trips to @entity141 , they said , and did not want to specify exactly whom they talked with , referring only to " folks " in " channels that are credible			0
" they said the most complete information they 've received about their son -- including that he is alive -- has come from sources other than those in the @entity57			1
they have worked to cultivate those sources			0
they expressed extreme frustration with @entity57 government " policies " that they said keep people in the @entity57 government from giving them information about their son			1
the parents have repeatedly been told that they need security clearance to hear information that officials have			1
" we do n't want to be treated like we 're a security risk , " @entity161 said			0
" who else has more motivation to be careful about information about our son ? " " we 've asked repeatedly , ' what is it that we need to do to enable you to share this information with us ? ' " @entity0 said she told @entity57 officials , without saying which officials specifically			1
the parents have been told " we 'll get back to you , " she said			2
@entity161 said the process has been " terribly frustrating , " adding that he feels that there are many in the @entity57 government that the parents have dealt with who genuinely seem to empathize and want to help the @entity180			1
but the @entity70 want to be clear			0
they are n't concerned with changing policy			0
they have a singular focus			0
" we want to get our son home safely , " @entity0 said			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity94 said wednesday that the family 's frustration is " understandable and heartbreaking			1
" " no parent should ever endure the @entity0 family 's anguish			1
we are in awe of their courage and tenacity in doing everything in their power to bring @entity200 home , " @entity192 said			1
" the government provides all of the information we can to families in these circumstances without jeopardizing our efforts to bring @entity200 home safely or putting at risk the intelligence sources on which we depend for our national security			2
" she said several @entity57 agencies had been working for @entity8 's release , though their efforts could n't be discussed publicly			1
a ' strong guy ' the @entity59 have talked to people who have been held hostage and freed			1
the parents are comforted to hear how much it means to those former captives when they realize how hard and constant their families ' fight to find them was			2
" it 's about faith , " @entity0 said			2
@entity161 said his son is a " strong guy " with a " strong mind , a strong body , " which gives him confidence that whatever his son is enduring , he will somehow find a way through			0
@entity8 loves the people of the @entity232 , his parents said			1
since he was a child , he has been curious			0
he wanted to know how people lived			0
he wanted to explore the world			0
he felt compelled to go to @entity2 because he was frustrated hearing time and again , during media coverage of the civil war , that reports could not be verified			1
@entity239 often blocked foreign journalists from covering the conflict and many journalists steered away from the war because the violence was so intense and often directed at them			0
" he thought , ' really , i have the ability to stay safe , ' " @entity161 said			0
his son , he said , felt it was a " calling " to go .			0
