@entity0 -- president @entity2 told @entity3 he has all the justification he needs to fire missiles into @entity6			1
" i have the authority to address the threat from @entity10 " he said in a primetime address on wednesday			2
where does he get it ? according to senior @entity2 administration officials it comes from a 13 - year - old vote @entity16 took in the days after 9/11 known as the @entity17 for the @entity18 ( @entity19			1
) the vote authorized president @entity21 to go after @entity23 terrorists			2
did @entity2 sell his @entity10 strategy ? that one single vote , taken on september 14 , 2001 before @entity2 even got to @entity16 as a senator from @entity27 , has been used to justify every @entity3 military action since , including now the fight against @entity10 in @entity6			1
but it may not actually provide @entity2 with all of the legal protection he needs this time			0
the discussion began with legal experts who have started to take issue with applying the @entity19 to the @entity10 situation			0
it will likely become a bigger discussion in @entity16 in the coming days			1
at the crux of the debate -- what exactly is @entity10 ' relationship to @entity23 ? here 's the breakdown			1
what 's the @entity2 administration claiming ? the @entity2 administration argues that because @entity10 formed out of an @entity23 affiliate , @entity2 's plan is legal under the @entity19			1
" we believe that he can rely on the 2001 @entity19 as statutory authority for the military airstrike operations he is directing against @entity10 , for instance , " a senior administration official told reporters on wednesday , using another name for @entity10 , which also calls itself the @entity51			1
" it 's important to note that @entity10 has its roots in @entity10 ; it was formerly the @entity23 affiliate operating in @entity59 for many years after the @entity3 - led invasion in 2003 , " the official said			1
5 takeaways from @entity2 's @entity10 speech @entity10 has its roots in @entity23 -- it grew out of @entity23 's affiliate in @entity59 , the @entity64 -- but the groups split when some of @entity10 ' tactics became too extreme for @entity23			1
secretary of state @entity68 reiterated the connection in an interview with @entity1 's @entity71 on thursday			0
" nobody has questioned the authority of that effort against @entity23 over the last years			0
this group ( @entity10 ) is and has been @entity23 , " he said			0
but some legal scholars are skeptical			0
" the statute that @entity16 passed in the wake of , and as a response to , the 9/11 attacks , read now so as to authorize the use of force in @entity59 and @entity6 against @entity10 -- a group that @entity23 expelled publicly ? it seems like quite a stretch , " @entity84 , a fellow in @entity85 for the @entity86 wrote on wednesday			1
@entity90 candidates finding distance from @entity2 on @entity10 where 's the legal line ? the question of whether the administration 's justification is legal is unclear because so far officials have n't explained the various intricacies of their argument , experts caution			1
" this is really complicated legally , " @entity101 , a law professor at @entity102 told @entity1			0
" the president 's speech ( wednesday ) night and then the background briefings have n't reflected this nuance			0
although the president is not bound to explain such nuances , i think it would be better for everybody , including the president , if the administration were more out front			0
" ultimately , @entity101 says , the question of whether @entity2 is acting legally ca n't be answered until we see what specific actions he takes			0
" everyone 's talking about this issue in abstract terms			0
there are lots of different authorities that any president has when it comes to using force and the authority depends upon why that force specifically is being used			0
" @entity131 's mother ' appalled ' by how @entity3 government handled her the law vs. the political optics if the president 's not acting in a matter consistent with the law , what happens then ? " if the president is acting unlawfully , no one 's gon na sue him , " @entity101 noted			2
" the remedy for a war powers violation is political , not legal			0
" in one sense , the politics are on @entity2 's side			2
a @entity1 poll taken earlier this month , before @entity2 's speech , found that a strong majority of @entity3 favor the type of expanded military actions outlined on wednesday			1
seventy - six percent of @entity3 support additional airstrikes against @entity10 and 62 % favor providing military aid to the forces fighting the group , so it may be politically untenable for members of @entity16 to voice too much resistance to this plan			1
but the favorable polling does n't alter the bad relationship between the president and @entity16			2
despite the consensus on @entity10 , passing a separate , @entity10 specific statute that @entity2 could sign would be very difficult			1
" the politics here are really problematic in two separate respects , " @entity101 notes			0
" one is just the optics for the @entity2 administration			0
the other is the terribly toxic relationship between the president and @entity16			2
even if everyone in @entity0 agrees that there should be some sort of forward - looking new statute to combat @entity10 -- that agreement is not going to produce a statute , where in any other context in @entity3 history , it would have			2

president @entity2 says his power to take military action comes from a 2001 vote
@entity16 voted in days after 9/11 to give the president power to fight terrorism
there 's a debate over whether that 13 - year - old law applies to the fight with @entity10
