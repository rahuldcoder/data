@entity0 -- former presidential candidate @entity3 will have to pay back over 2 million dollars in federal matching funds given to his 2008 campaign for president , the @entity2 ruled on thursday			1
the commission voted 6 - 0 against @entity3 and contends his campaign was in " excess of the candidate 's entitlement			0
" " at the end of the day if there were more matching funds received than campaign obligations at the point when the campaign ended you have to make a repayment , " @entity12 , @entity13 said during the hearing			2
this latest ruling comes on the heels of @entity3 ' indictment last month when a federal grand jury charged him with six counts , including conspiracy , issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws that indictment was brought up thursday by @entity2 commissioner @entity32 who called it " the pink elephant in the room			2
" @entity32 then asked other members of the @entity2 how a guilty verdict might impact @entity3 ' finance filings and force him to amend what the campaign spent			2
his trial is scheduled to start in october			0
" this gets a little confusing , this has not come up like this before , " @entity2 commissioner @entity32 said during the hearing			0
the @entity2 determined that @entity3 had received just over 2.1 million dollars in matching funds after the campaign was winding down and @entity3 was no longer in the race			1
the commission decided that in total his campaign must pay back $ 2,278,315 in excess matching funds			1
according to the @entity2 , " presidential candidates receive federal government funds to pay for the valid expenses of their political campaigns in both the primary and general elections			0
" @entity3 was represented at the hearing by his lawyers who filed this response to the audit			0
" @entity3 for president did not receive any matching funds in excess of its entitlement , and hence , no repayment is due , " they countered			1
@entity3 ' presidential campaign committee says it has $ 2.6 million in cash - on - hand as of june 30 , 2011			0
