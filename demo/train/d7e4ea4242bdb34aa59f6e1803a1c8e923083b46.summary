-- as @entity2 wrestle with how to oppose president @entity3 , what to do about @entity5 and how to compare the value of fights based on principle versus fights based on clever calculation , there may be some lessons from one of the darkest periods of @entity2 history			1
@entity15 was a slow - motion disaster for the @entity2			1
@entity17 , who had just won one of the largest majorities in @entity21 history in 1972 , was slowly being exposed and driven from power			1
at the same time , it was discovered that vice president @entity24 was illegally taking bribes			1
he was forced to resign			1
that resignation led to the first vice presidential appointment , that of the @entity29 , rep. @entity28			2
then @entity17 resigned , leading to the second vice presidential appointment , former gov. @entity31 of @entity32			2
that appealed to liberals but enraged conservatives			2
president @entity28 then pardoned @entity17 , leading to a further firestorm of outrage			2
the @entity2 were badly defeated in the 1974 congressional elections			2
the election of president @entity40 finished the defeat of the @entity2			2
republicans were shattered by their sudden collapse after the enormous 1972 victory			1
@entity2 leaders in @entity46 were shaken by the defeat of so many of their friends , many after two decades or more in office			2
in many ways , @entity50 was a one - party system by january 1977 , and the @entity53 seemed totally dominant			1
opinion : the @entity2 implosion the @entity53 housed liberals and conservatives , agrarians and urban intellectuals , men , women , young , old , blacks , whites , all creeds , dominated all regions and ruled all debate in @entity50			2
the @entity2 housed a small group of exhausted defeatists			2
by january 1977 , only 11 % of citizens younger than 30 identified with the @entity2			0
the party had been on fumes for years , ever since the @entity72 and only challenged the @entity53 for national authority when they screwed up , as in 1946 and 1968 , or when @entity2 nominated an overwhelmingly popular figure , such as @entity75 , in 1952			1
and with the election of @entity40 , a smart , moderate @entity77 from the @entity78 , the prospect for @entity53 rule for another generation seemed bright			0
the party of @entity86 had smothering control of the @entity88 , a filibuster - proof majority in the @entity84 and in the @entity78 , there were states such as @entity90 that had almost no elected @entity2 officeholders			1
the only state in the country that had @entity2 control of the legislature and the governor 's mansion was @entity98			0
the other 49 states had partial or complete @entity53 control			0
the old ways of accommodating the establishment by the @entity2 of the 1930s , ' 40s , ' 50s and ' 60s would no longer work			0
something else had to be tried			0
to conservatives such as @entity109 , accommodation was tantamount to capitulation and they asked themselves , " if we surrender on everything , what is the purpose of having a @entity2 ? " for several years , the @entity21 government had been making plans to yield control and ownership of the @entity118 to @entity119 , the dictator of the @entity118			1
all of the establishment was going along with it , from @entity122 to @entity17 to @entity123 , @entity124 and by 1977 , @entity40			0
nearly all the editorialists supported the " giveaway " of the canal at the height of the @entity127			1
control of the canal was vital to @entity21 military interests , especially with @entity134 control of @entity135 and designs on @entity50			1
opinion : @entity138 , @entity139 and freedom of the press into this void stepped former @entity142 gov. @entity109 , who launched a national campaign to oppose the giveaway			0
he gave speeches , stumped across the country and testified before @entity46			0
a " @entity152 " rose up and organized a " @entity147 " led by @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 , among others			0
petitions were circulated at the grassroots and delivered to @entity155			0
in speech after speech , @entity109 thundered , " we built it ! we paid for it ! it is ours ! and we are going to keep it ! " @entity163 had shown @entity21 support for the two @entity118 treaties , but by 1978 , the @entity21 people had switched and agreed with @entity109 and the conservatives -- and not @entity40			1
in the end , the treaties to declare the canal a neutral zone and eventually surrender it to @entity118 passed by the barest of margins , only by one and two votes more than the two thirds required in the @entity84			1
the war had been lost but the battle was worth it			1
principles had been established and arguments made			0
it led to @entity2 victories in the off year elections of 1978 and launched @entity109 's third campaign for the @entity88			0
years later , @entity40 himself acknowledged the potency of the canal issue in the election of 1980 , which not only saw the rise of @entity109 , but the loss of scores more democrats who had voted for the treaties			1
@entity109 used to joke that without his principles , without his conservatism , he would have been just another former actor			0
he knew standing one 's ground when one was right was enlightening and empowering			1
it is a lesson from history that applies today			0
fighting for principles and losing is always better than surrendering and in so doing , abandoning one 's reason for being			0
@entity109 had called in february 1975 for " bold colors , no pale pastels			0
" opposing the @entity205 turned out to be bold colors indeed			0
