-- despite decades of propaganda from marijuana prohibitionists , a majority of the @entity3 public has indeed said " enough " to the policies of cannabis criminalization			1
and no amount of fear - mongering is going to change this fact			0
writing in a just - published report by the @entity16 , " @entity20 , " authors @entity17 and @entity19 conclude , " in less than a decade , public opinion has shifted dramatically toward support for the legalization of marijuana			1
... demographic change and widespread public experience using marijuana imply that opposition to legalization will never again return to the levels seen in the 1980s			2
the strong consensus that formed the foundation for many of today 's stringent marijuana laws has crumbled			2
never in modern history has there existed greater public support for ending the nation 's nearly century - long experiment with pot prohibition and replacing it with a system of legalization and regulation			1
the proof is in the polls			2
for example , according to a may 2013 @entity45 nationwide survey , conducted by @entity46 , more than nine out of 10 @entity3 adults say that people who possess or consume small quantities of cannabis should not face jail time			1
also last month , a may 2013 nationwide @entity53 telephone poll , conducted by under the direction of @entity55 and @entity56 , reported that 85 % of voters support allowing adults to use cannabis for therapeutic purposes			2
the total is an increase in support of 4 percentage points since @entity53 last polled the question in 2010 and is the highest level of public support for the issue ever reported in a scientific poll			0
opinion : legalizing marijuana a boon to potheads then there is this : an april 2013 national survey commissioned by the @entity76 reports that 72 % of @entity3 now believe that " government efforts to enforce marijuana laws cost more than they are worth , " and 60 % say the government should no longer enforce federal anti-marijuana laws in states that have approved its use			1
and this : according to a december 2012 @entity85 national sampling of @entity3			1
voters , 66 % say that they expect cannabis to be legal within the next 10 years			0
and finally there 's this : recently published polls by @entity91 , @entity76 , @entity92 and @entity93 all find that far more @entity3 now favor legalizing marijuana for adults than believe in its continued prohibition			1
why ? the answer has become obvious			0
the ongoing enforcement of cannabis prohibition burdens taxpayers , encroaches upon civil liberties , engenders disrespect for the law , impedes legitimate scientific research into the plant 's medicinal properties , and disproportionately impacts communities of color			1
furthermore , the criminalization of cannabis simply does n't work			0
despite more than 70 years of federal prohibition , @entity3 ' consumption of and demand for cannabis is here to stay			2
voters ' recent passage of legalization measures in @entity119 and @entity120 acknowledges this reality			2
such laws seek to take control of the marijuana market from untaxed criminal enterprises and , to impose common - sense regulations governing cannabis ' personal use by adults and licensing its production			0
unlike the federal government , which continues to define cannabis as an illegal commodity that is as dangerous as heroin , voters recognize that a pragmatic regulatory framework that allows for limited , licensed production and sale of cannabis to adults but restricts use among young people best reduces the risks associated with its use or abuse			0
@entity146 : why i changed my mind on weed marijuana regulations can allow governments to establish legal parameters for where , when , and how markets operate			0
they can provide oversight of who may legally operate in those markets and provides guidelines for best practices			0
society would clearly benefit from this			0
only criminals and cartels benefit from the unregulated environment			0
maybe an even more persuasive if not entirely counter-intuitive argument in favor of legalization as a means to actually deter youth use is found in recently released @entity91 polling indicating a dramatic reduction in youth cannabis use rate as there is a surge in favor of cannabis legalization from virtually all segments of @entity3 society			1
it is time to end our failed policies on marijuana criminalization and replace them with ones that regulate the cannabis market and allow for its private consumption by adults			0
marijuana legalization is no longer a matter of if ; it 's a matter of when			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 and @entity192 .			1

@entity191 , @entity192 : ground has shifted in favor of legalizing pot
they say @entity3 think enforcement is too costly
writers : polls shows more in @entity3 favor legalizing pot for adults
writers : pot legalization is not a matter of " if , " it 's a matter of " when "
