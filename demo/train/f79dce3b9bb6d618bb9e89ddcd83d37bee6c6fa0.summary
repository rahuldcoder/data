-- clad in his trademark black overcoat @entity1 famously sprinted down @entity3 's touchline eight years ago to celebrate @entity5 's last - gasp equalizer which knocked @entity6 out of the @entity7			1
and if @entity1 gets his way the @entity9 coach will be spending much more time on the touchline -- the @entity13 coach wants football 's authorities to introduce a timeout system			1
widely employed in sports such as @entity15 , basketball and ice hockey , timeouts allow a coach to talk directly to their players when a game is stopped			1
at present soccer coaches are only allowed to give tactical advice to their players at half time			2
" it 's something that i think football could improve a little bit , " @entity1 , who celebrated @entity9 's recent win over @entity29 in the @entity7 by sliding on to his knees on the @entity32 turf , told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
" it would be to allow during a match to find a way to allow the coach to have a relation with the players			0
" @entity9 's coach suggested that the timeout should come midway through the first half			1
" you could ask for a minute like the @entity48 sports have			2
it probably would be a solution , or give us some more freedom to walk around the touchline			0
" read : old money @entity9 hold off nouveau riche @entity29 @entity1 's career at @entity5 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity9 has been characterized by meticulous planning and his use of early double or triple substitutions to change the course of a game			1
but he revealed he was flexible in his approach to the way he delivered his half - time team talks			1
" sometimes , it 's emotionally			0
sometimes , it 's spontaneous			0
sometimes , you do n't think and sometimes , you do n't have time to think , " said @entity1			2
" but many other times , of course , i prepare myself			0
" even when i 'm in the match , the last 10 minutes of the first half , more than analyzing the game , i 'm preparing myself for half - time because that 's when i can have an impact on the players			1
" i can help the players to improve and to win a match , so i try to be an observer and i try to analyze the game during the first 30 - 35 minutes of the first half and the last 10 minutes , i am preparing myself for my direct contact with the players			2
" the @entity9 coach added : " players are incredible artists and during the match , sometimes they express themselves in a way where they 're not even thinking about it			1
they do things where they do n't think			0
and i think with coaches , it can happen the same			0
" however , @entity1 admitted that his advice was not always heeded by his players			0
notably when he was @entity57 coach and devoted the majority of a half - time team talk pleading with @entity97 forward @entity96 to take care and not get sent off in a @entity7 game against @entity100			1
but @entity1 's words of wisdom fell on deaf ears and almost immediately after the restart the enigmatic @entity96 picked up a red card			1
" i could write a book of 200 pages of my two years at @entity57 with @entity96 , but the book would be not a drama , the book would be a comedy because he 's a funny , he 's a funny kid , " said @entity1			2
read : @entity114 hat - trick leaves @entity9 in command of @entity116 more seriously , @entity1 suggested @entity29 manager @entity117 might be the only coach who could persuade @entity96 , who scored a late equalizer for @entity29 in the 1 - 1 @entity7 draw with @entity119 on wednesday , to maximize his formidable talent			1
" @entity117 was his first coach as a professional , so before me , " said @entity1			2
" so for sure the same feeling i have , @entity117 has probably even more than @entity96			0
" you know , @entity96 was 18 with @entity117 at @entity57 , was 20 with me			0
now , he should be 22 , so the natural tendency is that he grows up and becomes the player that the talent he has			0
" i 've no contact with @entity96 in this moment , but i hope so			0
i hope so , and @entity117 knows him well , speaks the same language , knows him since he was a kid , so if he does n't do it with @entity133 , it will be difficult to do with another one , but i hope so because he 's a talent			0
