-- dr. @entity1 , the @entity3 administration 's nominee for surgeon general , will visit the @entity6 @entity5 on tuesday for his @entity8 confirmation hearing			1
many may not even know we need to appoint someone to the position , but they should n't fret			0
the role of " @entity6 's doctor " has declined over the last several decades to near - irrelevance			2
at a time when @entity6 have fallen behind on key health metrics across the board , the nation 's leading spokesman for public health has less influence than ever before			1
the office has endured everything from political interference to undersized budgets , making it impossible to carry out the job effectively			0
have you ever heard of @entity30 ? how about @entity31 ? the recent surgeons general are n't exactly household names			2
but with each changing of the guard , we can -- and should -- hope for a leader who revitalizes the post			2
perhaps @entity1 might do just that			2
at 36 when nominated , he stands to be the youngest surgeon general ever appointed			1
he 's already accomplished quite a bit , from co-founding a clinical trial operations company to helping start doctors for @entity6 , a national health care advocacy group			1
some observers , including myself , have raised concerns about his partisan ties to the @entity3 administration			0
still , if confirmed , @entity1 should do everything he can to strengthen the impact of the office			2
in november , right after @entity1 's nomination , i published four initiatives in @entity55 for the next surgeon general to pursue			1
these recommendations do not come close to addressing all of our health needs , but they have the potential to restore the profile of the surgeon general and improve our public health : help @entity6 understand health care system we have n't stopped arguing about the @entity67			1
yet countless surveys show that most @entity6 do n't understand the legislation , let alone the health care system at all			1
as recently as last month , more than 30 % of @entity6 surveyed still were n't familiar with the law			2
" @entity74 " shamed people on the sidewalk for thinking @entity67 and the @entity67 were different			0
and , whether it 's insurance terms or broader trends in health care costs , the public does n't seem to have a clue what 's going on			1
that 's where the surgeon general comes in			1
@entity6 need a public figure who can transcend the partisan fray to explain the intricacies of health care			1
a national tour is in order			0
nonetheless , whether on television or @entity94 , the surgeon general could spread awareness about navigating health care : a system that functions best when its patients are informed			1
surgeon general links colon cancer , diabetes to smoking change the way we look at obesity obesity remains one of the greatest threats to @entity6 health , but our attitudes toward this issue are profoundly lopsided			1
in our culture , being overweight represents a failure of will power , a tendency toward sloth			0
public health campaigns point to personal responsibility as the answer to this crisis			2
if we would just get off the couch and eat healthier , everything would be solved			0
it 's time we re-evaluate how we look at and tackle obesity			2
rather than narrowly concentrating on notions such as individual will power , we must address the systemic causes of obesity -- fast - food advertising to children , federal legislation that subsidizes processed foods and undeveloped food tax policies , among others			0
organizations such as the @entity133 have already shifted their focus toward these kinds of structural determinants			0
by translating the message to the public , the surgeon general can lead the charge			1
is obesity the next smoking ? stand up for vaccines enough is enough			0
though dozens of peer - reviewed studies have refuted the extreme claims of the anti-vaccination movement , the idea that vaccines are inherently dangerous somehow persists			0
states such as @entity151 and @entity152 have seen thousands of parents exempt their children from immunizations			0
@entity156 ran a national television program stoking fears about the safety of human papillomavirus vaccines			0
last year , congressional representatives introduced the @entity162 to evaluate whether vaccines cause autism -- apparently , it 's a bipartisan issue now			0
@entity6 have to understand the science is clear			2
vaccines are among the most powerful public health tools in the history of human medicine			0
without them , we expose others and ourselves to terrible , needless suffering			0
the surgeon general should release a report defending the facts and get the message out			1
give an annual ' state of @entity179 ' update to @entity180 our leaders in government -- and the broader public -- need to keep abreast of the most pressing health issues of the day			2
but we do n't have a unified approach to fulfill that goal			0
the surgeon general should introduce an annual " @entity189 " report , with testimony to @entity180			1
this yearly update could highlight recent scientific findings to results from prior initiatives , specific policy proposals to expectations for the months ahead			0
the report should be a nonpartisan , independent analysis of the nation 's health			0
with this platform , the surgeon general should remind us that our prosperity depends not only on economic policy and national security but also public health			1
whether or not the next surgeon general follows these recommendations , one thing is obvious : @entity6 have become older , fatter and sicker , yet the nation 's doctor has disappeared			1
the brand of the surgeon general remains intact , and @entity6 trust this figure for guidance			1
but we need an outspoken , independent leader to bring public health to the forefront of our national conversation			0
dr. @entity1 , are you up for the job ? the opinions expressed are solely those of @entity223 .			1

dr. @entity1 is the nominee for next surgeon general
the surgeon general should help educate on health care , @entity223 says
changing the way the @entity6 views obesity is *important* , @entity223 says
an annual congressional update also could be helpful , he says
