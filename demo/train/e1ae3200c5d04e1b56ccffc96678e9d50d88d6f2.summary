it 's an odd experience flying in to @entity1 , southern @entity2 , on the border with @entity4 and its nasty and seemingly infinite war these days : there is a truly international flavor to the passenger manifests			1
as we flew in , there were two men from @entity12 , one with a limp , accompanied by a woman from @entity15			0
on another flight which we saw land , two young men with large backpacks , coming from @entity18			0
on another , four @entity21 , also from @entity18			0
then a young , bearded man with a noticeably thick northern @entity25 accent , there to collect a friend from @entity27 -- the pair absolutely do n't want to talk , especially when i offer them a @entity31 business card			1
then come the @entity32 , and a @entity33 -- he sounded @entity34 -- who frantically kissed and embraced the bemused driver there to pick him up			0
all these were men travelling in small groups or alone			0
most refused to talk at all about why they were there , although the man from @entity27 said he was doing humanitarian work , and the @entity18 pair were open about the fact that they were going to @entity4			1
it 's not a crime to travel to southern @entity2 , and there are many foreign aid groups here , so surely many people are traveling innocently			1
but it is extraordinary to watch this volume of international traffic from countries where @entity54 has a confirmed and consistent presence into a @entity57 member state			0
you find yourself asking : why are these men here , and why do n't they want to talk about it ? one man -- we 'll call him @entity64 -- has a clearer idea why so many foreigners come here : he 's a smuggler , working to facilitate recruits joining the @entity4 @entity54 - linked radical group , the @entity68 ( @entity68 )			1

he walks us through some olive groves as he explains how a route that was once little used has now become a busy - if unofficial - border crossing			1
it leads from the airport to a local safe house and then , at night , to the often porous fence between @entity4 and @entity2			1
in the past few months , @entity64 tells me , he 's moved about 400 people across the border , and that the rate of people making the crossing has almost tripled since the chemical attacks on the @entity91 suburbs in august			1
and that 's just him ; there are many other smugglers operating in the area			0
@entity2 officials have said they are intensely involved in the fight against terrorism , as @entity2 is itself a victim of extremists , one official saying that any smuggling route that exists must be stopped			1
the international community did n't act , @entity64 explains , so the global jihadi response has become overwhelming			0
and for many , the crossing itself is a religious experience			0
@entity64 said : " when they get to the fence , they kneel and cry , they weep , like they 've just met something more precious to them than their own family			0
they believe this land , @entity4 , is where @entity120 's judgment will come to pass			2
" read more : @entity4 rebels using satire as a weapon repeatedly , we heard the claim that this jihad -- the radical @entity129 ' fight against the @entity131 regime and , increasingly , in favour of the creation of an @entity68 caliphate in @entity4 , held formerly by chaotic but moderate rebels -- is a final calling			1
many of these devout muslims believe they are joining the final battle prophesied as happening in @entity4 -- known as @entity140 -- which will herald the @entity141			2
the recruits are ecstatic ; they never thought this final fight would come in their lifetime			0
one such believer we meet -- we 'll call him @entity147 -- is visibly shaking with excitement about crossing over into @entity4 the next morning			1
@entity147 is from the restive @entity150 stronghold of @entity151 in @entity152 , and explains that before the @entity154 - led invasion he was not a radical , or even particularly religious ; now he epitomizes the hard - core beliefs that are fuelling the @entity157 parts of the @entity4 rebel movement			1
chillingly , he smiles and almost giggles as he talks of how happy he is to be going to @entity4 , to become a martyr , to die in the jihad			1
@entity147 's presence here is a sign of something that @entity165 is increasingly aware of : the borderless nature of the @entity68			2
he explains the group 's goal to establish a caliphate all the way from @entity151 in @entity152 , to @entity171 , in the northeast of @entity4			2
the result : an @entity68 state where hardline @entity157 rules are followed , limiting the role of women and imposing often crude @entity157 justice on those who violate their codes			0
@entity147 's journey too is remarkably telling			2
he says he chose to fly into @entity2 and come across the border as it was so much simpler than travelling along the hot dusty roads from @entity151 , which neighbors @entity4 , through rebel - held regions			1
travelling through @entity2 has become so straightforward and comfortable that it is the route of choice for this jihadist			2
read more : @entity4 snipers ' target pregnant women ' " there are people coming from @entity202 , @entity203 , even @entity204 , " he said , claiming that the number of @entity196 recruits to the jihad is exceeding the @entity199 complement			2
the reason for this is clear : anger at the failure by the @entity154 and @entity196 nations to take military action against the @entity131 regime after the august chemical attacks			1
it 's a failure that has , @entity147 says , also made those nations the enemy			2
" our fight is with the @entity222 now too , as their silence means they are complicit , " he says , listing the " international community " alongside @entity218 , @entity219 and the @entity131 regime as an enemy			0
and this is where the story of @entity4 's endless bloodshed gets absurdly confused ; the @entity131 regime has constantly claimed it is fighting terrorism , even when -- a year ago -- it was shelling civilians loyal to the moderate rebels			1
slowly , as the outside world [ you mean @entity235 nations ] failed to come to the rebels ' aid , the @entity129 gained sway			0
one key group , @entity239 , was declared a terrorist organization by the @entity154 in 2012 , and now , as if to validate the @entity131 regime 's earlier fiction , @entity68 has become perhaps the pre-eminent group inside northern rebel - held @entity4			1
@entity68 is linked to @entity54 ; it seeks an @entity68 caliphate , it blames the @entity222 for what is happening , and it is sitting on @entity57 's border			0

they repeatedly insist they are fighting extremists in the region			0
their president , @entity254 , warned this weekend in an interview with the @entity257 , that @entity196 can not entertain the idea of " something like @entity260 on the shores of the @entity262			0
" a @entity2 official who did not want to be named discussing a sensitive issue , told @entity31 that " as a country that has suffered from terrorism , it is irrational [ for anyone ] to think that @entity2 would support these terrorist groups			1
if these crossings are happening , then we need to review the entire process ... the entire chain of recruitment and travel needs to be addressed			0
" he added that extremist groups were getting stronger inside @entity4 because the international community had failed to tackle the @entity4 crisis			2
" as long as that continues these groups get stronger each month " , he said			0
but the reality is that it is nearly here already			0
we stood at the @entity2 border and filmed a chilling sight : the flag of @entity68 , flying calmly over a minaret a few hundred meters away in the @entity4 town of @entity290 - a sign that they control the town			1
@entity2 now has to reconcile the seemingly relaxed traffic of jihadis into their south to travel into @entity4 -- many of whose aim is to help establish an @entity54 - friendly caliphate -- with the fact they can now see @entity54 from their border			1
it could n't get any closer			0
