-- may 25 , @entity1 , is a day on which we honor and remember missing children			1
this date was chosen specifically because it is the date in 1979 when 6 - year - old @entity6 went missing on his way to school in @entity10			1
the @entity12 case has resurfaced as a result of some potential new leads and an arrest that hopefully will result in the case finally being solved			0
i have the greatest respect and empathy for the parents of @entity21 , who are going through what is clearly one of the greatest nightmares any parent can experience -- never again seeing and not knowing what happened to one 's own child			0
just as the @entity30 case in the 1930s became a landmark case for increased national awareness concerning ransom kidnapping , the @entity12 case became a landmark case for increased national awareness concerning " stranger abduction			2
" each of these cases played a major role in creating laws , but they also fueled some confusing stereotypes			0
when i joined the @entity44 in 1970 and someone talked about child abduction , you immediately assumed it was a ransom - motivated case			0
in less than 20 years , the attitude drastically changed to almost immediately assuming any child abduction involved a sexual predator			0
either assumption is obviously not always correct			0
because of his young age and other case factors , it can be reasonably assumed that @entity21 was most likely abducted			2
however , children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons ( e.g. , runaway , lost or injured , benign episode , family abduction ) other than nonfamily abduction			1
children can also be abducted by nonfamily members for a variety of reasons ( e.g. , to solve a personal problem , ransom / profit , to kill , miscellaneous criminal activity , political ) other than sexual gratification			1
most missing children are not abducted and most abducted children are not missing			1
the typical child abduction is a relatively brief event in which the child is usually returned before anyone had time to note the child was missing			0
the best research data we have indicate that only a very small percentage of missing children were abducted by a nonfamily member			1
of these cases , most of the abducted children were teenagers			1
and of the nonfamily - abducted children , almost all of them were returned alive and relatively uninjured a short time later			1
understanding that the terms missing and abducted are not synonymous and interchangeable is important in awareness and prevention efforts			1
in addition , sexually motivated nonfamily abduction is probably the only aspect of sexual victimization of children that people think occurs more often than it actually does			0
people tend to underestimate the likelihood that a family member or trusted acquaintance will sexually victimize their child , but overestimate the likelihood of stranger abduction			0
i am aware of no research that indicates that children today are any more likely to be abducted by sexual predators than they were 50 years ago			2
many adults love to reminisce about an idealistic childhood during which they did not lock their doors and could play outside with no fear of abduction , but believe that today they can not let their children out of their sight			0
however , nonfamily members abduct less than a few hundred children each year in a manner that fits our stereotypical image of an abducted and missing child			2
the danger of sexual victimization of children comes predominantly from family members and acquaintances , not strangers			0
on this important day , we should remember the reality of missing children such as @entity6 , but not at the expense of ignoring or misunderstanding other types of victimization of our children			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			2

may 25 is @entity1 , chosen because of @entity6
@entity142 : children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons
he says most missing children are not abducted , most abducted children are not missing
@entity139 : awareness about missing *vs.* abducted children will help prevention efforts
