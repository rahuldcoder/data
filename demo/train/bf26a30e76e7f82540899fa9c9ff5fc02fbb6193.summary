-- @entity1 , @entity3 bills itself at the " @entity4 , " the only city with four living recipients of the @entity7 , the highest award for combat bravery and sacrifice			2
former local resident @entity11 and her husband , @entity12 , were behind the grassroots effort to get community leaders to formally recognize these military heroes			1
it was only the start of the 53 - year - old woman 's journey to protect their heritage of service that has taken @entity11 to the @entity23 @entity22 , where the justices will debate a federal law she helped create , draft , and sell to often skeptical congressional lawmakers			1
the law is the @entity29 , which makes it a crime to falsely make a verbal , written , or physical claim to a military award or decoration			1
the court will hear arguments wednesday in this free speech dispute , involving a @entity38 lawmaker who lied in office about earning the @entity7			2
" it was much tougher than i had expected , i thought this law was bipartisan , and would be a shoo - in , " @entity11 told @entity0 of her years - long efforts			1
" despite all that i still would have taken this on , i was just a little naive at the start			2
" @entity11 is not lawyer , and never served in the military , but her husband did two tours in @entity47 and now advocates for veteran rights on his website www.homeofheroes.com			1
the couple has also been long involved in helping ferret out military medal frauds , working out of their home , often with their own money			1
that was the inspiration for the @entity29 , which began almost by accident			2
@entity11 works at a @entity59 non-profit , and also performs as a ventriloquist with her partner @entity61			1
she had returned to college at middle age at @entity64 as a political science major			2
while pondering a class assignment in 2004 , she happened to overhear her husband talking to an @entity68 agent about a man profiled in a newspaper , falsely claiming to have won the @entity7			1
" @entity12 was exasperated and said there 's nothing we do about these fakes , based on existing policy , which is @entity76 " of criminal procedure , recalled @entity11			1
" i said it was about time someone did something about this			2
and i decided right there i would			2
" she told her professor she would write her paper about these impostors and then go further : transform it into law			1
" these fakes had slipped through the cracks of the law , and ( that ) was not the intent of the original law			1
i felt everyone who lied about this should be punished , not those that just committed monetary fraud or similar crimes			2
my professor said good intentions were not enough			0
i had to sell it and explain why people should care			0
" step one was a meeting with a local congressman , which did not go well			0
@entity11 then called on newly - elected rep. @entity106 ( @entity107 )			1
the military veteran was instantly sold on the idea			0
his staff work for months with @entity11 and others to draft the legislation and make sure it met legal scrutiny			1
that was when frustration set in			0
@entity11 is a lifelong @entity117 but her congressional sponsor is a @entity119 , who after three terms in @entity121 is now @entity3 's agriculture commissioner			1
@entity11 says republicans who controlled @entity121 were not too eager to let a freshman @entity119 in a key political swing district like the @entity125 get political mileage out of a supposedly bipartisan bill			1
the @entity129 legislation hung up in committee for months			0
" it took awhile , but we had great support eventually , " said @entity106 , speaking by phone from his @entity3 ranch			0
" @entity11 and @entity12 went beyond the call of duty to make it happen , they were instrumental			1
" @entity11 earned a special school fellowship to visit @entity59 for her project and also helped raise funds to personally march the halls of @entity121			1
using one - on - one time with representatives , it was a strategy that worked surprisingly well			0
" @entity11 is not some slick lobbyist , she 's a straight shooter from @entity1 who just talked common sense , " said her husband			1
" she always believed one person can do almost anything			0
and once the congressmen heard from her personally , they supported her			0
on this she succeeded beyond her dreams			0
" @entity11 's persistence finally paid off in 2006 when she was on hand to watch @entity121 easily pass @entity158 1998 , the @entity29			1
it was only after the @entity160 began prosecuting fake heroes that the legal challenges began , on free speech grounds			0
" this is a narrow bill , it deals with something @entity121 specifically decided needed to be addressed , " she said			0
" to me it 's not a free speech issue , it 's a fraud issue			0
when someone devalues the bravery of other rightful heroes , it devalues everyone			0
" she cites as her inspiration a quote from president @entity175 , who created the @entity176 for those military members who have " given of his blood in the defense of his homeland			2
" " should any who are not entitled to these honors have the insolence to assume the badges of them , they shall be severely punished , " said @entity175			0
@entity11 worries if the @entity22 overturns the law , it would only make it easier for military frauds to ride on the backs of others ' bravery			1
" i 'd be heartbroken if we lost			0
the problem would escalate , i 'm sure of that			0
" the @entity200 next mission : to secure a government - funded national database of all medal citations , making it easy for the public -- employers , voters , family , almost anyone -- to easily check who has received what			1
privacy concerns have blocked previous efforts			0
@entity215 's own comprehensive database has been his obsession in recent years			2
working on his own time and with his own money , his lists are routinely used by the @entity68			0
the database was recently bought by the @entity221 , and he now devotes his efforts to keeping it up to date and comprehensive			2
both he and his wife remain modest over their efforts			0
" i was glad i could play a small part in preserving the honor of our military heroes , " she said , " so that those who would try to lie about it or benefit from it are exposed for what they are			0

@entity11 made the law a mission
" it was much tougher than i had expected , " she said
her husband created a database of medal winners
