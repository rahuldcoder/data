-- tiny diamonds found in the soil are " strong evidence " a comet exploded on or above @entity5 nearly 13,000 years ago , leading to the extinction of dozens of mammal species , according to a study			1
diamonds found in @entity5 soil suggest a comet led to the extinction of dozens of mammal species			1
the scientific report also suggests the cataclysm also reduced the population of the earliest people to inhabit the region and triggered a 1,300 - year - long cold spell that stretched around the world			2
the heat generated by the extraterrestrial impact likely melted much of a glacier that once covered the @entity17 , sending a massive flood down the @entity25 , the study said			1
according to the report , the cold waves of glacial runoff into the @entity28 shifted @entity31 currents , changing climate patterns throughout the world in a cooling period known as the @entity35			0
" a rare swarm " of comets rained over @entity5 about 12,900 years ago , sparking fires that produced choking , leading " to the extinction of a large range of animals , including mammoths , across @entity5 , " the report said			2
the study was conducted by a group of eight archaeologists and geologists from the universities of @entity49 and @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			0
their findings were published friday in the journal @entity57			0
ireport.com : have you ever seen a comet ? show us the prehistoric humans known to have inhabited the continent at the time of the event -- hunters and gatherers dubbed the @entity69 culture -- suffered a major decline in population in the aftermath , the scientists said			1
the scientists studied layers of sediment dated to 12,900 years ago at six @entity5 locations , including one directly on top of a @entity69 site in @entity79 , @entity80			2
each layer was rich in nanodiamonds , which are produced under high - temperature , high - pressure conditions created by cosmic impacts , the report said			0
" the nanodiamonds that we found at all six locations exist only in sediments associated with the @entity35 boundary layers , not above it or below it , " said @entity88 archaeologist @entity87			0
" these discoveries provide strong evidence for a cosmic impact event at approximately 12,900 years ago that would have had enormous environmental consequences for plants , animals and humans across @entity5			1
" the other sites studied were in @entity104 , @entity105 ; @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 , @entity109 , as well as @entity110 , @entity111 ; and @entity112 , in the @entity114 province of @entity115 .			0
