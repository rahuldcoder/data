-- two @entity2 men arrested last week at @entity3 allegedly on their way to fight with an @entity6 - affiliated group in @entity7 were followers of an extreme @entity10 group based in @entity11 , @entity0 has learned			1
@entity0 has obtained an image of the two suspects , @entity14 and @entity15 , attending a protest in @entity11 organized by the @entity17 on june 1 of this year			1
they appear to have been taking part in a demonstration against @entity20			0
one is holding a banner , the other an @entity17 poster that includes the slogan , " exterminate the @entity25			1
" the society 's video of the event , posted on its @entity30 channel , has since been removed			0
the rally took place just a week before the two suspects were arrested at @entity3			1
" my soul can not rest till i shed blood			0
i wan na like be the world 's [ best ] known terrorist " @entity14 is alleged to have told an undercover agent in the @entity40 late last year			1
later he said , " we 'll start doing killing here , if i ca n't do it over there			0
" another image -- from late in 2008 -- shows @entity15 at a different rally , holding a poster that says " @entity47 " ( sic )			1
it 's not clear whether that rally was organized by the @entity17			1
several calls to the @entity17 about @entity14 's and @entity15 's involvement with the group were not returned			1
on its website , the @entity17 says , " our struggle is always intellectual & political non-violent means			1
" but counterterrorism officials say that the group and another called @entity58 have come under scrutiny for their anti-western rhetoric and for endorsing the actions of @entity6 and other terrorist groups			1
the two groups often hold joint events			0
while they have few full - time members and their rallies are sometimes sparsely attended , the @entity17 and @entity58 have thousands of followers online , many of them @entity40			1
according to counterterrorism officials they also organize private gatherings in the greater @entity11 area			0
" in a sense they are almost bug lights for aspiring jihadists , " the director of intelligence analysis of the @entity77 , @entity78 , told @entity0 earlier this year			2
" they 've got an @entity82 , anti-democratic , anti- @entity40 , pro-al @entity6 message			1
" in april , @entity58 posted a warning on its website that the creators of the cartoon " @entity88 " risked being killed for their depiction of the @entity90 in a bear suit			0
the warning was widely seen as a threat			0
@entity14 and @entity15 are by no means the first @entity40 alleged to have had links to the groups			1
@entity0 revealed in its recent documentary " @entity102 " that @entity97 , a @entity98 convert to @entity99 from @entity100 , moved in @entity17 circles in @entity11 before he left the @entity40			1
@entity97 went to @entity103 determined to wage jihad against @entity40 troops in @entity106			0
he subsequently confessed to helping @entity6 plot a bomb attack on the @entity108			1
@entity0 revealed in the documentary that followers of the @entity17 not only helped radicalize @entity97 , but also helped him connect with militants in @entity103			1
several other @entity40 recently charged in terrorism cases were followers of these groups			1
counterterrorism officials say @entity115 , a @entity116 woman also known as @entity115 , was an online follower of the @entity117			0
@entity115 was charged in march with plotting to assassinate a @entity119 cartoonist ; she has pleaded not guilty			0
@entity120 , a @entity121 resident , was charged last year with planning violent jihad in the @entity40 -- including planning to attack shopping malls			0
he had connections with members of @entity58 , according to @entity58 , one of the group 's founders			2
@entity0 can not independently confirm those connections			0
@entity58 has since left the @entity40 , says he has quit @entity58 , and is now living in @entity128			0
@entity120 has not entered a plea			0
counterterrorism officials tell @entity0 that before he founded @entity58 , @entity58 was the chief ideologue of the @entity17			2
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity133 last year , @entity58 said he had met @entity97 , the @entity100 @entity6 recruit , and made no secret of his radical views			2
" i love @entity136 like i ca n't begin to tell you , " @entity58 said			0
the @entity17 and @entity58 are offshoots of @entity139 , a pro-al @entity6 @entity140 extremist group that has seen several of its supporters convicted of terrorism offenses in the @entity140			1
like @entity58 , the @entity17 is still active on @entity11 streets			2
in april it held a protest rally outside the @entity20 consulate			2
after the rally , the group 's spokesman , @entity146 , told @entity0 that the group plans to step up its activities in @entity11 and was successfully recruiting supporters			2
the activities of both @entity58 and the @entity17 are protected by @entity154 guarantees			2
" as much as the @entity17 might put out an extremist message , it seems they go right up to the line of the @entity154			2
for the most part they , themselves as a group , are n't acting , " @entity77 's @entity78 told @entity0 recently			0
terrorism experts believe that groups like the @entity17 are dangerous nonetheless			2
according to @entity165 , a former scholar in residence at the @entity77 , " even if they do not have the connections to help [ young radicals ] go further , they articulate the glory of fighting @entity170 , the glory of doing something , of being active			0
and this very much inspires young people			0
