a new meeting time was not immediately proposed , the command said			0
they planned to discuss the march 26 sinking of a @entity1 warship , the @entity16			1
the @entity6 officers were slated to be @entity7 colonels , as the @entity7 holds responsibility for @entity6 security forces in @entity10			0
@entity8 had accepted a @entity6 proposal for the meeting of colonel - level leaders to be a precursor to talks between generals on the contentious naval incident			1
the demilitarized zone was created as part of the armistice signed between @entity10 in 1953 that halted the @entity32 , but the war has never officially ended			0
the @entity34 and @entity8 began occasional meetings between generals -- " general officer talks " -- at @entity38 in 1998 to lessen tensions			1
there have been 16 such meetings to date , the last one in march 2009 , the @entity34 said			1
on friday , the @entity34 formally condemned the sinking of the @entity16 but did not specifically name @entity8 , which an international joint civilian - military investigation deemed culpable			1
@entity44 , @entity45 , the @entity7 , @entity46 and @entity1 provided experts for the inquiry			2
" the @entity52 deplores the attack , " the 15 - member council said friday in what is known as a presidential statement			0

" it uses the term ' attack ' repeatedly , which you do n't have to be a scholar of the @entity82 language to understand is not a neutral term			0
" @entity1 welcomed the statement			2
" i think it 's crystal clear that [ the ] @entity52 made it clear that @entity8 [ is ] to be blamed and to be condemned , " said @entity89 , @entity1 's ambassador to the @entity34			1
a presidential statement , unlike a @entity52 resolution , is not legally binding , though it requires approval of the council 's five permanent members : @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , the @entity45 and @entity7			0
the @entity52 expressed " deep sympathy and condolences " for the deaths of 46 sailors aboard the @entity16			0
the isolated @entity10 has maintained its innocence , rejecting the investigation findings outright , questioning the validity of the experts involved , asking to conduct its own inquiry and telling the @entity52 that @entity8 is the true victim of a conspiracy			2
a spokesman for the @entity111 of @entity8 , officially the @entity8 , called the presidential statement " devoid of any proper judgment , " according to the state - run @entity114 on friday			2
