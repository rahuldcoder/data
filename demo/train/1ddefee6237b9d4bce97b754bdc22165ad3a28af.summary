@entity1 @entity0 are wrapping up their tenure in the majority by reigniting debate on some of the former president 's most controversial policies with a long - delayed report on the use of torture - " enhanced interrogation techniques " - by the @entity11 government			1
six years into the @entity15 's presidency , the @entity13 early next week is expected to release findings from its $ 50 million investigation of the @entity19 's use of so - called enhanced interrogation techniques on detainees in the years following the sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks			1
among the questions the report tackles : did three detainees tortured under the program provide information that helped identify a courier who led the @entity11 to find @entity29 ? the answer to that question will likely be different based on already hardened points of view even after the @entity1 report is released			1
the @entity19 believes the interrogations of three men : @entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity39 provided key information that led to @entity29			0
related : military orders security review ahead of torture report release more than a hundred detainees went through the @entity19 's detention program , and about a third were subjected to " enhanced interrogation techniques , " which included waterboarding , exposure to cold temperatures , slapping and sleep deprivation			1
three were waterboarded , which is considered the harshest of the techniques			1
the agency now disavows the program as a mistake that it wo n't repeat			0
related : " we tortured some folks , says president @entity15 " but they are also trying to walk a fine line , by sticking to claims that valuable intelligence on @entity62 and in the hunt for @entity29 emerged from the harsh interrogations of detainees			1
@entity67 's @entity66 asked former president @entity68 about the report in an interview set to air on @entity71 sunday			1
" i 'll tell you this , " @entity68 said after clarifying that he had n't read the @entity1 report yet			1
" we 're fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the @entity19 serving on our behalf			0
and whatever the report says , if it diminishes their contributions to our country it is way off base			1
i knew the directors , the deputy directors , i knew a lot of the operators			0
and we 're lucky as a nation to have them			0
" officials briefed on the report say it will provide ugly new details on the @entity19 program , including specifics on detainee deaths and a portrayal of a haphazardly assembled and poorly managed program			1
the report will detail 20 findings , plus 20 case studies that the @entity0 say illustrate @entity19 's misrepresentations about the program			1
the @entity29 hunt is one of the 20 case studies			0
countries that cooperated with the @entity19 , hosting black site prisons and assisting in transferring detainees , will be identified only obliquely and not by name			0
@entity19 employees , referred to by pseudonyms in the report , wo n't be identified ; the @entity19 pushed for the pseudonyms to be redacted because other information in the report could be used to determine who they are			1
the @entity1 report was conceived initially as a bipartisan review of the @entity19 program , though @entity119 senators pulled support from the investigation soon after it began			1
its findings likely will end up being seen through the prism of the deeply - partisan divide over the @entity68 - era counter-terrorism tactics and whether they actually produced intelligence to keep the nation safe			1
the investigation produced a report that is more than 6,000 pages			2
but only the 480 - page executive summary is being released , following months of negotiations between the @entity1 and the @entity135 over redactions			2
according to an administration official , 93 % of the report is unredacted			2
" there 's going to be nothing lost in this narrative , " the official added			0
there also will be a separate rebuttal by the committee 's republicans			2
and the @entity19 will publish its own study of the program			0
conspicuously absent from the @entity1 report is any examination of the role of high - level officials in the @entity154 who authorized the @entity19 program and who urged that more aggressive tactics be used			1
that omission appears to lay blame for the program 's excesses solely on the @entity19 , when top @entity68 officials ordered the agency to come up with the detention and interrogation program			2
a @entity1 aide said the purpose of the report was n't to point fingers at the @entity68 administration , but to examine the program itself			2
the central conclusion by the @entity176 - led @entity1 report , according to people briefed on the investigation , is that @entity19 employees exceeded the guidelines set by @entity182 memos that authorized the use and that the agency misrepresented to @entity185 and the @entity135 what it was doing			1
the report has also opened a rare public rift between the current @entity135 and some democrats on @entity190			2
sen. @entity191 , who chairs the @entity13 and is usually a defender of the @entity19 , has unleashed stinging criticism of the agency after what she said was a series of cover - ups including the destruction of interrogation tapes			1
" the interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the @entity19 detention sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the @entity19 had described them to us , " @entity191 said on the @entity1 floor in march			0
related : shocking report closer to completion her remarks came during a spat with the @entity19			2
@entity191 was angry at the discovery that @entity19 employees had conducted searches of computers used by @entity1 staffers at a @entity19 facility to conduct their investigation			0
the @entity19 in turn accused @entity1 staffers of hacking into @entity19 computers to obtain documents they were n't entitled to.â € ‹ in a phone call friday , secretary of state @entity223 asked @entity191 to consider the broader implications of the timing of the report 's release , said @entity230 spokeswoman @entity229			1
" a lot is going on in the world , and he wanted to make sure that foreign policy implications were being appropriately factored into timing , " @entity229 said			0
" these include our ongoing efforts against @entity238 and the safety of @entity11 being held hostage around the world			1
" during the call , @entity223 made it clear " that the timing is of course her choice , " @entity229 said			0
@entity191 also claimed some of the report 's findings challenge the " societal and constitutional " values of @entity11			1
" we have to get this report out , " @entity191 told the @entity251 in an interview sunday			2
" anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again			0
" did torture work ? @entity258 , a former @entity259 agent , who was one of the bureau 's top @entity62 experts , says the torture " did n't work			2
" in an opinion article published in the @entity264 last year , @entity258 says " torture led us away from @entity29			2
after [ @entity37 ] @entity37 was waterboarded 183 times , he actually played down the importance of the courier who ultimately led us to @entity29			0
" @entity270 , who was the @entity19 's acting general counsel during the period , is convinced the program helped find @entity29 and that it protected the nation			0
" i believed the program yielded valuable intelligence and i continue to believe this , " he told @entity67 in an interview earlier this year			0
also in dispute -- and some say unknowable -- is whether other methods could have produced the same or better information than what the @entity19 program produced			0
@entity11 intelligence and law enforcement officials have mixed views on whether any intelligence information still in use by intelligence analysts came from the program			1
some officials say that because of the way intelligence is gathered , it 's impossible to determine whether strands of intelligence , used to keep tabs on @entity62 terrorists , came from the now - banned interrogations			1
others say that the @entity259 and @entity19 already had detailed knowledge of @entity62 and that the program simply duplicated information already in the hands of intelligence analysts			0
for some republicans and @entity19 supporters , there 's still a dispute about whether techniques like waterboarding , used on three detainees , constitutes torture			1
the @entity182 twice has investigated the conduct of @entity19 employees involved in the program and decided not to bring charges			0
president @entity15 an early critic of the program as senator , has tried to be more even - handed since taking office			0
" we tortured some folks , " the president said in august , adding that there was a need to recall the context of the era , including the fear of follow - up attacks			0
" in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 , we did some things that were wrong â € ” we did a whole lot of things that were right , but we did some things that were contrary to our values ... i understand why it happened			0
it 's important when we look back to recall how afraid people were			0

@entity0 are set to release a long - delayed and much - anticipated review of @entity11 interrogation techniques
the report will tackle the question of whether torture helped gain intelligence
@entity119 have pulled support from the report and will offer their own rebuttal
