watching the season 4 premiere of @entity2 , it was easy to imagine you had fallen into a @entity5 coma and missed a few shows			1
when did @entity8 's much - tortured cop become so handy with a hoe ? when was @entity13 's depth perception - challenged maniac @entity10 going to make an appearance ? and , perhaps most bewilderingly , when did it become okay for @entity16 to call @entity17 " ? to address these questions — and many more ! — we spoke with walking dead comic writer and walking dead tv show executive producer @entity21			1
@entity22 : how much time has gone by in - between the end of season 3 and the start of season 4 ? @entity21 : we say " a few months			1
" some people think a few is two , some people think a few is three			2
it 's a vague answer			2
@entity22 : what 's up with @entity5 and the gardening ? @entity21 : well , we like to change things up			1
i have to say that is my favorite opening of any season thus far — just the fact that it 's the walking dead but it 's about a guy who comes out and starts hoeing a garden			1
i was thrilled about that from the moment that ( walking dead showrunner ) @entity46 suggested it			0
we always like coming in and showing that there 's been a passage of time and these are n't the exact same characters that we last saw			1
i 've always been willing to push the envelope with that			0
i feel that 's a really cool thing to do , to come in and reintroduce the show to people , and set the stage for all the new things that are going to be coming			1
the fact that every season of the walking dead has been somewhat different thematically has been a really cool evolution and is something we hope to continue every season			2
@entity22 : what would you say is this season 's theme ? @entity21 : it 's a lot of what comes from that woman [ in the woods ] in the first episode : it 's " are n't these people too far gone ? " and " can these people retain a little bit of humanity ? " we 're going to be dealing with those questions a lot more intensely than we have thus far on the show			1
it 's all about @entity5 coming from this place where he kind of went off the deep end in season 3			1
@entity5 feels like he failed at everything he was trying to do and so this is him trying a different path and seeing if he can make that work			0
@entity22 : maybe this a foolish thing to say based on having just seen the premiere			0
but this was the first ever walking dead show i could n't at least roughly place in the chronology of the comic			2
have you made a decisive break with that mythology ? @entity21 : there 's a lot of new elements at play here but we 're definitely still dealing with a lot of things from the comic book			1
you 'll see , starting with the second episode , there 's some very big moments from the comic book that are being worked in in a different way			2
there will always be moments where you 're like , " oh , that 's exactly like the comic book ! " a lot of that stuff is coming up in future episodes			2
@entity22 : i 'm not a doctor — i just play one on tv — but i 'm assuming there 's some sort of nasty , swine flu - type virus abroad in the prison			2
@entity21 : well , it 's definitely some kind of nasty illness			1
something that can make a guy go from cough - cough - i 'm - not - feeling - well - can - i - go - lay - down ? to essentially bleeding out in the shower after a few hours is something on the swine flu level — possibly a little bit more deadly			0
@entity22 : and that kid @entity141 coughed all over the water supply ! @entity21 : well , that shower water supply is fairly contained			1
that 's like a bag that they fill up			2
i do n't know how this works , i 'm getting a little too technical here			2
all the water is contaminated ! it 's very dangerous ! be careful ! @entity22 : what did you name your family pig when you were a child ? @entity21 : [ @entity154 ] i find it offensive that you think because i 'm from @entity156 i grew up with pigs			1
but " @entity159 " is the answer			0
@entity22 : presumably @entity160 is hunting the governor , right ? @entity21 : yes , that is who she is after			1
the story there is that , after the events of season 3 and the death of @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity17 spent some time out in the wilderness looking for the governor and eventually @entity17 decided , " look , this is a futile effort and we 're not going to find this person			1
" and @entity160 kept it up			0
@entity22 : she 's heading to @entity178			2
is there any chance of her catching an @entity182 show while she 's there ? @entity21 : we can only hope that they are still performing shows			1
if that 's where the governor is and that 's what she 's doing i do n't know how @entity160 's going to handle that			1
she 's gon na want to watch the show , she 's gon na want to get revenge			0
she 'll be be torn			0
@entity22 : here 's a question you 're not going to answer : how long before we see the governor ? @entity21 : [ @entity154 ] is this the question your boss makes you ask ? @entity22 : no one 's the boss of me ! @entity21 : he 's definitely going to appear at some point this season			1
it 's possible there are elements of his return that have already been set up in some ways you might not have noticed			0
but when he returns it will be at a time when you least expect it			0
@entity22 : is @entity10 now a ghost town ? @entity21 : that will be dealt with in an upcoming episode			1
@entity22 : the zombie hanging from the store ceiling by his intestines was a very nice touch			0
@entity21 : look , if they ever need to rappel down something they 're able to do that			1
@entity22 : on the other hand , i 'm not very happy with anyone referring to @entity17 as " @entity17			0
" @entity21 : [ @entity154 ] yeah , @entity231 asked for that			1
he makes everyone on set call him @entity17			0
we worked that into the show			0
@entity22 : judging from the premiere , i got the impression you will be exploring the character of @entity242 more this season than you have done previously			0
@entity21 : i think that to a certain extent we will be exploring all characters more than we have			2
this show has been doing a lot of world - building for the first three seasons			0
now that we 've got that out of the way , this season we 're going to be intensely focused on the characters themselves			0
you 'll learn a lot more about @entity242 , you 'll learn a lot more about @entity17 , you 'll learn a lot more about @entity5			0
we 're going to be doing a lot of character work this season			0
@entity22 : you 're both world - building and empire - building			0
what 's the status of the walking dead spin - off show ? @entity21 : it 's currently , quote unquote , " in development " so there 's not really a lot to say about that			1
but i can say that it 's going to be awesome ! see the original story at @entity22 .			0
