-- in the violent bedlam that has engulfed @entity2 , not even the hospitals are immune from attack			1
such an attack happened monday afternoon to the @entity7 hospital in central @entity2 , where several artillery shells slammed into buildings there			1
video from the scene shows doctors frantically bringing hospital workers and patients to the relative safety of the ground floor			1
one patient and four people visiting the hospital , three of them children , were killed in the strike , according to health workers			1
at least 30 were injured , they said			0
despite the risks , @entity24 , a freelance @entity25 journalist , made her way to the hospital			2
the latest reports from @entity2 and @entity30 " the road to @entity32 [ the neighborhood where the @entity7 hospital is located ] was really dangerous and exposed , " she said			1
" at one point , when we arrived near the hospital ... a bomb fell 50 meters away from us			2
" @entity24 said that she decided to leave because " it was too dangerous to stick around			0
" but on the way back to @entity41 , her team saw a convoy of the @entity44 and @entity43 making its way to @entity32			0
she did a u-turn and followed the vehicles			0
" all the hospital staff were on the ground floor when we arrived			1
they were waiting for the @entity44 convoy so they can evacuate the patients " to other hospitals			0
" we started walking around to the other floors to see the damage			0
one side of the third floor was bombed several times ; we saw a lot of impact hits from tank shells on the walls , " she said			0
operating theaters and the maternity ward were among the rooms damaged			0
" some walls and rooms were totally destroyed , covered with dust and debris			0
the shock was so strong that a pillow in one of the rooms was hanging on the fan on the ceiling			0
" the tank shells fired not only penetrated through the exterior wall but managed to go through several walls inside the hospital , shows the power of the impact these shells did on the hospital			1
" the hospital is one of three in @entity2 to have been damaged during nearly two weeks of conflict			1
last week , the @entity86 in northern @entity2 was hit by an airstrike			1
@entity30 : @entity90 was storing weapons there @entity30 officials say that @entity90 has deliberately used hospitals and buildings around them to store weapons or build launching sites for their rockets			1
in the case of the @entity100 , the @entity98 said that their " initial investigation suggests that a cache of anti-tank missiles was stored in the immediate vicinity of the hospital			1
this cache was successfully targeted by @entity98 forces			1
" in a statement , the @entity98 added : " civilian casualties are a tragic inevitability of the brutal and systematic exploitation of homes , hospitals and mosques in @entity2			1
while the @entity98 takes every possible measure to minimize civilian casualties , @entity90 and its deliberate tactic of embedding terrorist activities within the urban environment is ultimately responsible			1
" for the patients and the medical staff trying to save their lives , the consequence is the same			2
hospitals are running out of rooms to cope with admissions and running short of medicine and other essential supplies			0
the @entity131 has arranged for truckloads of medical supplies to cross into @entity2 from @entity30 , but some are delayed because of the conflict			2
paramedics pay the ultimate price paramedics have been among the casualties as they have raced through @entity2 's crowded streets to collect the injured			2
on sunday , one paramedic died and four injured yesterday when their ambulance was hit during @entity30 shelling of the @entity145 neighborhood			0
the @entity146 says 24 ambulances have been destroyed or disabled since the conflict began			0
@entity24 is based in @entity149 in the @entity150 and has long been sympathetic to the @entity152 people			2
but she says she is committed to nonviolence and is committed to documenting the suffering of civilians			0
she says @entity2 's hospitals are gradually being reduced to ruins			2
" you can see around the [ @entity100 ] hospital that there is water running in the street because the water tanks were bombed and the water system that feeds the hospital was destroyed by the shells			2
" but even if the hospitals themselves are unsafe , they continue working , she says			0
" they are planning to evacuate the entire hospital because it 's too dangerous , but for now , they want to keep the hospital running because it 's the only hospital around			0
" @entity30 finds @entity90 are no longer amateur fighters deaths mount in @entity2 and @entity30 as @entity177 pushes cease - fire caught in the violence , it 's the hardest question in @entity2 mother finds wounded son in hospital where she works			1
