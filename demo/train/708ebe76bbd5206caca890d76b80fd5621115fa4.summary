-- @entity1 is quick with a quip when asked why he decided to write a biography of @entity4			1
@entity4 is the president of his time who is " most like us , " says biographer @entity1			1
" any president who tried to attack his own assassin is worth writing about , " @entity1 says			2
but @entity1 quickly turns serious when tallying the seventh president 's historical importance -- and personal flaws			1
" he is the president [ of his era ] most like us , " the @entity14 editor says in a phone interview from @entity16 , @entity17			0
" he was capable of great grace , but he could also be terribly cruel			0
... in his complexities , i saw our own			0
" it 's those kinds of contradictions that have kept historians revisiting @entity4 for the past 175 years , and got @entity1 going on " @entity29 " ( @entity30 )			1
@entity4 was the first president not from @entity32 or @entity33 , a frontiersman and general not connected to the @entity36 or @entity38 aristocracy			2
he was viewed with distaste by some , admiration by others			0
some @entity38 colleagues , including @entity45 congressman @entity44 , believed he was little more than an erratically tempered hick with dictatorial impulses			0
" i can not believe that the killing of 2,000 englishmen at @entity52 qualifies a person for the various difficult and complicated duties of the @entity55 , " @entity44 once said , referring to @entity4 's victory at the @entity49			1
but he also was the subject of hero worship among citizens who admired him for his military leadership , his steadfast loyalty to national ideals , and the fact that he was n't what would now be called a " @entity38 insider			0
" @entity1 , who had access to a trove of heretofore - unreleased letters from @entity4 intimates , sees him as closer to the latter			1
" he could use his passions and temper to his ends , or he would n't have been president , " @entity1 says			2
" i do n't believe he could have been president , even in 1828 , if he were a wild man			2
" @entity4 obviously still inspires fascination today			2
@entity1 's biography has been high on the @entity76 bestseller list since it came out in mid-november			1
as portrayed by @entity1 , the president was not without wounds			2
some were psychological : he " never recovered from being an orphaned little boy , " says @entity1			0
some were political : he saw himself as the victim of a " corrupt bargain " in the 1824 election , in which he had won a plurality -- but not a majority -- of popular and electoral votes in a four - way race			0
by law , the election was thrown to the @entity91 , where the presidency was awarded to @entity93 ( with , @entity4 believed , the conniving of @entity44 , who became @entity93 ' secretary of state )			0
@entity4 married his wife , @entity97 , before she was officially divorced from her first husband , unbeknownst to either of them ; when she died at 51 just after the 1828 election of a heart attack , @entity4 blamed the stress on the attacks of the national press , which had found out about her past			0
indeed , @entity4 's own health was often questioned , and some observers wondered if he would survive his first term			1
a number of @entity4 's policies still bother historians , most notably his instigation of " @entity114 removal , " which forced @entity116 tribes from their homes east of the @entity118			1
ironically , @entity4 was friendly with a number of native chiefs , but he was determined to open their lands to white settlement			0
but @entity1 finds much to admire in the seventh president			1
though a religious man , he was a strong believer in the separation of church and state , " which was unusual for a man of his background , " @entity1 says			2
( he also did n't trust ministers ; during his first term , one reason for a cabinet crisis was a clergyman 's whispering sanctimony			0
) and @entity4 's passion came in handy , whether in shutting down the @entity136 ( which he saw as a rival power center and a tool of the wealthy ) or simply staying alive			1
when a deranged painter attempted to shoot him near the @entity140 in 1835 , @entity4 -- as @entity1 says -- attacked the man			1
( he also won a duel in 1806 , killing a man named @entity144 ; he carried @entity144 's bullet in his chest for the rest of his 78 years			0
) this was also the man who , upon leaving office in 1837 , purportedly said he had only two regrets : " that i have not shot @entity44 or hanged [ former @entity4 vice president ] @entity152			1
" though duels are no longer in vogue , @entity1 says @entity4 can still provide a template for the new occupant of the @entity157			1
indeed , he says , @entity158 would be wise to use @entity4 's most noble passion : his belief in the power of the common man , which to @entity4 was more than mere words			1
" as long as our government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will ; as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property , liberty of conscience , and of the press , it will be worth defending , " @entity4 once observed			0
" [ @entity158 should ] keep people connected , " says @entity1			0
" people want to be a part of things			0
