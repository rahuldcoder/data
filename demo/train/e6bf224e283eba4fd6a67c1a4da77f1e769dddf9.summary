-- a modern - day @entity2 story is unfolding in @entity4 over whether you have the right to know what 's in the food you purchase			1
the outcome will likely have national implications			2
what 's at stake is @entity13 , the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified			1
in support , you have a large grassroots movement that includes farmers and ranchers , fishermen , business owners and consumers			1
on the other side , you have a handful of large corporations such as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 that are fueling the food fight by spending millions of dollars to stop the people 's right to know			1
for @entity33 and myself , it 's simple -- being honest with your customers is the foundation of good business			2
companies ought to be proud of the ingredients they use and the products they sell , and they ought to be happy to disclose what 's in those products			2
about 60 % to 70 % of processed foods contain laboratory - grown , genetically modified ingredients known as @entity46 -- genetically modified organisms			1
according to a @entity49 poll released in july , 93 % of @entity47 want labels on food with gmos			1
@entity53 : how is genetically modified food labeled ? @entity46 labeling is being considered in almost 30 states			1
@entity57 and @entity58 have passed mandatory @entity46 labeling laws			0
but in a political system where money talks , too often the people are silenced			0
according to analysis from @entity65 , a similar initiative failed in @entity66 last year after opponents spent $ 46 million -- five times more than proponents			0
in @entity4 , supporters of labeling have raised money from more than 13,000 contributors , with the median donation of $ 25 a pop. the opposition , on the other hand , has raised money from 10 donors , with the average donation of $ 545,827			1
as a result , the citizens who support labeling are being outspent three to one			0
if @entity13 passes in @entity4 , it would be the first no - strings - attached legislation for mandatory labeling			2
and that 's a good thing			2
it would create the momentum and the precedent for more states and federal protections to follow			0
in other words , it would be another big win for @entity2			0
residents of @entity4 have a big opportunity to vote yes on @entity99 and turn the tide on labeling laws			1
in the long term , we need to level the playing field by reducing the amount of money that big corporations spend influencing legislation and elections			2
while i 've been in @entity4 lending my voice to @entity112 on @entity113 , @entity33 has been traveling around the country with @entity115 -- a grassroots movement of tens of thousands of people who are legally stamping messages on dollars that say " not to be used for @entity121 " to support the national movement to # @entity123 of politics			1
the use of @entity46 ingredients in food is similar to the issue of money in politics			0
at the very least , there should be transparency and disclosure			0
people deserve to know what ingredients are in their food and whose money is being spent to influence the laws			0
in the best - case scenario , we should get big money out of politics , stop big corporations from influencing our laws and reclaim our republic for " @entity147			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

@entity152 , @entity153 : you have the right to know what 's in your food
@entity4 to vote on whether to require labels on genetically modified food
writers : a grassroots movement is *pitted* against *agribusinesses* such as @entity26
writers : corporations spending millions should not determine the outcome of the vote
