-- two women in veils and voluminous white gowns kneel in front of a statue of the @entity6 , exchanging vows and prayer beads to the languorous intonations of @entity11 chants			2
this unconventional ceremony on saturday was the first same - sex @entity11 wedding held in @entity15 , where a landmark bill to legalize same - sex marriage has been pending since 2003			1
no countries in @entity19 have legalized same - sex marriages so far , although there have been signs of progress in some -- most recently in @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity27 's high court expands gay rights @entity29 said she and her partner of seven years , @entity31 , decided to hold a @entity11 wedding to acknowledge their own faith , as well the predominant religion of the nation , according to the @entity38 newspaper			1
they hoped the ceremony , which was performed by a renowned @entity11 master , would encourage @entity15 society to accept same - sex marriage			1
" of course it helps ( promote same - sex marriage ) , said @entity45 - wen , secretary of the @entity47 , saying that the ceremony set a strong example for the @entity11 community			1
she added that its legitimacy was bolstered in the public 's eyes by its blessing from @entity56 , a highly - respected @entity11 social activist , who presided over the ceremony			1
@entity56 founded the @entity58 and the @entity59 at @entity60			0
the @entity11 ceremony followed a mass same - sex wedding extravaganza last august , where 80 lesbian couples participated in a " @entity65 and @entity65 's wedding " in the capital city of @entity67 , attracting over 1,000 guests and curious onlookers			1
@entity15 was the first nation in @entity19 to introduce a bill to legalize same - sex marriage and adoption by same - sex couples			1
drafted in 2003 under former president @entity75 , it has made little headway in @entity15 's legislature , however			1
@entity45 said the issue of same - sex marriage is often given lip service during electoral campaigns , but there is little effort to push the bill forward once the winning candidate takes office			1
at a gay rights awareness event in 2006 , when the current president , @entity87 , was the mayor of @entity67 , he said homosexuality was a " natural phenomenon " and " gay rights are part of human rights			0
" since taking office in 2008 , he has been mostly silent on the issue			0
gay men , straight women : enduring bonds the government is also under pressure from @entity101 groups -- who comprise a small but vocal religious minority in @entity15 â € ” @entity45 said			2
given the little political will at present , she said the pressure to push the bill through needs to come from the grassroots level			0
she is optimistic that same - sex marriage legislation will be passed in the next few years , saying the " gay and lesbian community is getting stronger and stronger			1
" @entity67 's annual gay pride parade has become @entity19 's largest since its inception in 2003 , according to organizers , attracting 50,000 people last october			2
@entity45 said this year 's parade will focus for the first time on same - sex marriage rights			1
elsewhere in the region , @entity24 held its first gay pride parade on august 5 , attended by around 100 people in the capital of @entity122			2
it followed inaugural gay pride parades in @entity125 and @entity126 in may and june , respectively			0
in july , @entity24 's @entity127 announced it would consider including a provision for same - sex marriage rights in a proposal to the @entity131 next year , as part of an amendment to the country 's marriage laws			1
while @entity137 activists are unsure how far the government will truly take the matter , it appears the decision may stem from practicality			0
" it 's time for us to look at the reality , " justice minister @entity142 said in an online debate			0
" the number of homosexuals has mounted to hundreds of thousands			0
it 's not a small figure			2
... they may own property			0
we , of course , have to handle these issues legally			0
" in may , @entity25 's @entity156 announced it would include an " others " category to recognize the alternative gender identities of @entity137 people on citizenship certificates and other official government and business documents			2
woman who had gay slurs carved in her body speaks out @entity25 's @entity167 ruled in favour of granting full rights to @entity137 people in 2008 , including the right to marry			2
but the @entity25 lgbt community is still waiting for these rights to be written into the country 's new permanent constitution , which has been dogged by repeated delays and protracted negotiations			1
" i remember when i told my parents that we would get married , their first question was , ' is this legal ? ' " @entity29 told reporters at her wedding			0
" i could only say to them that it would ( become legal ) soon , but i did n't know when would be considered soon			0
so we hope it will become legal			0
for us and for our families , it is very important			0
