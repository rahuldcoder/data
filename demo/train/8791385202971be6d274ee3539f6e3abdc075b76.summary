-- editorial cartoonist @entity1 may be good enough to win this year 's @entity2 , but he 's evidently too biting to get past the auditors who run @entity6 's @entity5 app store , who ruled that lampooning public figures violated its terms of service			1
@entity1 irked @entity6 's censorious staffers with his cartoons making fun of the @entity14 hoax and the pair that famously crashed a @entity16 , according to @entity17 at the @entity18 @entity1 won a pulitzer monday for animations he made for the sfgate , the online home of the @entity21			1
but @entity1 , a freelancer who runs a syndication business , was rejected by @entity6 in december for an app called @entity24 that features his work			2
according to a december 21 e-mail reprinted by @entity18 , @entity6 rejected his app because it " contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of @entity31 from the @entity32 which states : applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , sounds , etc. ) that in @entity6 's reasonable judgment may be found objectionable , for example , materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic , or defamatory			1
" neither @entity1 nor @entity6 responded to requests for comment			2
the news of the rejection comes not long after @entity6 decided to purge its app store of content that included nudity , a retroactive ban that included apps from respected @entity55 publications such as @entity56 and @entity57			1
@entity1 's rejection may be especially disconcerting to news and media organizations , many of which are betting heavily on @entity64 apps as a way to get users to pay to read magazines and newspapers , and to get advertisers to pay print - ad prices for online content			1
( online ads cost a small percentage of what ads in glossy magazines cost , in no small part because the net has almost infinite advertising space			0
) @entity6 has built a little slab of @entity80 with its @entity64 , which is meant to be an experience unsullied by provocative or crude material			2
it 's beautiful and enticing -- the company has already sold more than a half million of them in the first two weeks it 's been available -- but it 's not the real world			0
publishers , including such august organizations such as the @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity0 's parent company @entity91 , see a solution to their declining dead - tree ad sales in building a pay - to - play attraction in that park			0
but they need to understand that to do so , they have to play by @entity99 's rules			0
the signs have been there from the start , as @entity0 's @entity103 pointed out in february			0
@entity6 banned an e-book reading application once because it figured out that @entity5 users could use it to read a free version of the @entity107			2
then last week , @entity6 abruptly banned apps developed using programs that translate apps into multiple platforms			0
adding the news of @entity1 's ban to that , the publishing world is now officially on notice that the @entity64 is @entity6 's , and unlike with their print and web editions , they do n't have the final say when it comes to their own content on an @entity6 device			1
