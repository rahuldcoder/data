-- " people would say , ' oh , what 's wrong with your golf , what 's going on with your golf ? ' and i thought , it 's not golf , it 's my head			1
" when @entity12 spoke after the opening round of the women 's golf season 's first major tournament on thursday , it was n't just her impressive five - under - par 67 at the @entity16 that people wanted to talk about			1
the @entity18 turned her back on golf last october , struggling with the isolation of life on the @entity22 and under the weight of a condition which was driving her to drink			1
" people think , ' @entity26 , just get over it ' if you 're in a bad mood or whatever			0
it really impacts you physically , " the 32 - year - old revealed			0
' @entity36 ' invests in golf 's future " playing on this tour , coming out and trying to play , grinding it out each week when you 're not sleeping and you ca n't concentrate or focus and the other symptoms with it , it just gets you down , and it 's a bit of a nightmare			1
" @entity47 's battle was depression was at its fiercest during lonely nights on tour , when the only respite she could find was in the bottle			1
" but i think the lowest is when you have insomnia and you 're waking up at 2 a.m. , " the four - time @entity22 winner said			2
" there 's no relief from your mind , really , and i mean , the only time i really had any relief is if you had probably two bottles of red wine			1
" it helps you sleep , but it 's not the way to combat it			2
that 's when i realized i 've got a problem here , and i 've got to deal with it because i 'm getting worse			0
" @entity47 's condition was at its worse in 2009 , after she had just achieved the most impressive result of her career by coming second at the @entity73 -- one of four majors in the women 's season			1
" i had a great season , " she said			0
" i finished second to @entity79 at the @entity73 , and after that it was kind of on a downhill slope , slippery slope			0
" it just kind of happened quickly			0
you have bouts , and without getting into the psychology and everything , it was n't a great time , and i just could n't really get through it			2
" i rang home in september last year and said , ' i 'm done			0
i do n't want to play anymore			0
' and my dad had said , ' you know what , that 's great if you want to do that , but you need to have something to fall back on			0
' " so during her time away from the course , @entity47 set about taking her first steps on alternative career paths			1
" i worked as a media person at the men 's @entity105 , and then i worked with the tournament office at the men 's @entity108 and did some other things relating to media stuff and sport , " she said			2
" it was really great			0
i did n't pick up a golf club from the last event i played , which is @entity116 , until january 2			2
" @entity47 's break from the sport seems to have worked wonders			1
she holed a 13 - foot birdie putt to clinch the @entity121 last month , and after a solid first round she is on track to challenge for her first major title in @entity125			1
" if you had said to me before @entity127 , you 're going to win , i would have went , ' oh , yeah , whatever , i 'm so unlucky			0
' but having won that tournament has opened all these doors for me to play in @entity130 , which i really want to do			2
" i 'm excited to do that			0
and i 'm really enjoying my golf , which it 's not a grind anymore			2
i 'm actually enjoying it , the good and the bad			0
" @entity47 was one shot off the lead held by @entity139 @entity138 , who carded a 66			1
@entity116 's five - time major winner @entity140 ( 68 ) was one stroke back from @entity47 , ahead of a clutch of players on three under including 2010 @entity145 winner @entity144 .			1

@entity12 makes strong start to @entity16 , one shot off lead
the @entity18 *recently* took time away from golf to battle with depression
@entity47 says on some nights she drank two bottles of wine to help her sleep
she won the @entity121 in *february* , a month after returning to the sport
