-- @entity1 is another step closer to political redemption , but the real headline out of his tuesday victory in a @entity7 primary runoff for his old congressional seat was a rare public appearance by his former mistress -- who 's now his fiancée			1
and while the former @entity13 governor is considered the favorite in next month 's general election showdown with @entity17 nominee @entity16 , the sister of satirist and @entity20 host @entity19 , his past infidelity remains front and center in the race and could continue to hurt him with crucial female voters			1
@entity17 wasted no time in attacking @entity1 over the affair			2
" this is the same @entity1 who , as governor , disappeared from office and used taxpayer money to visit his mistress			2
with all the issues we are working on , we do not need him in @entity39 , " wrote sen. @entity32 of @entity33 in a fundraising e-mail for @entity16 sent in the hours after @entity1 's victory			1
" fortunately , there is a strong independent woman running to give us a better alternative named @entity16			2
" @entity1 addressed his " incredibly long journey " at his victory celebration over former @entity46 councilman @entity44			2
" in that journey , i am humbled			0
" he added that while @entity50 forgives , " sometimes the voters are n't so forgiving			0
" @entity1 thanked supporters , family , and his fiancée , @entity54 of @entity55			2
the former governor said wednesday on @entity0 's " the lead with @entity58 " that he was surprised by her appearance at the victory celebration			0
" she completely surprised me , " @entity1 told @entity0 chief @entity61 correspondent @entity58			2
" it was an awfully , awfully nice surprise			0
" @entity1 wins @entity7 nomination for @entity66 seat " i did n't know she was coming , but i 'm excited to see her , " he said			1
the affair came to light in 2009 , after @entity1 disappeared from public view for several days and re-emerged , claiming he 'd been hiking the @entity72			0
he later admitted that he was actually in @entity55 , seeing his lover			0
the episode sank any hopes @entity1 had of making a bid for the 2012 @entity7 presidential nomination			1
@entity1 and then - wife @entity78 were divorced in 2010 and he finished his second term as governor in january 2011 , exiting to what many thought would be political obscurity			0
@entity1 is touting his fiscal conservative credentials as he campaigns for @entity39 , but he 's also asking the public for a second chance , telling @entity0 that he was seeking " redemption " by running for office again			2
he came in first in a 16 - candidate primary two weeks ago , but only with 37 % of the vote , far short of the 50 % needed to avoid a runoff			0
he topped @entity93 in tuesday 's runoff by a 57 % -43 % margin			1
@entity96 appeared to try to make infidelity a key issue in the runoff campaign			0
" trust is a crucial issue			0
in fact , it has become a crucial issue in this race , " the candidate said at a debate with @entity1 last week			0
@entity96 added that the former governor was a " compromised candidate " because of the affair			0
now @entity1 faces off may 7 with @entity16 , an official with @entity111 's wind turbine drive testing facility			1
she is expected to have an uphill climb in the general election because the district is heavily @entity7			2
the @entity116 has been in @entity7 hands for more than three decades			0
rep. @entity118 won re-election to the seat by 27 percentage points in last november 's election			2
but when @entity7 @entity125 sen. @entity124 stepped down from his seat late last year to take over as the head of the conservative @entity128 , @entity7 gov. @entity123 named @entity118 to fill the seat , triggering the special election to fill the seat that @entity1 held for three terms before becoming governor			1
@entity1 : shamed politician fights for comeback @entity16 's famous brother has campaigned on his sister 's behalf			1
" she 's my sister , and i 'm willing to , you know , break the jewel of my own creation to try to do something for her , " @entity19 told @entity58 , @entity0 's chief @entity61 correspondent and anchor of @entity0 's " the lead			0
" @entity19 will team up again with his sister for fundraisers later this month in the nation 's capital and in @entity33			0
but @entity17 are focusing on @entity1 's affair			1
" the families of this district need a representative who they can trust , " @entity16 campaign spokesman @entity153 said tuesday night			1
" @entity1 simply has the wrong values for our community			0
@entity161 press secretary @entity160 tried to put rep. @entity162 , a senior @entity66 @entity7 , on the spot			1
" even republicans acknowledge that congressman @entity1 's behavior was a disgrace and that he betrayed the public trust , so will congresswoman @entity162 support @entity1 in his quest to return to @entity61 ? " @entity1 disagrees , saying his runoff victory shows he does n't have a problem with female voters , at least those in his party			1
there were a lot of @entity7 conservative women that voted last night			0
and what they did was decided to send me in as the @entity7 standard - bearer in this congressional seat , " @entity1 told @entity58			1
but some @entity13 @entity7 disagree , saying that the female vote could be an issue for @entity1			1
" surveys show @entity1 has a problem with women , and some may never forgive him , " said @entity7 strategist @entity185 , a partner in the consulting firm @entity186			1
" acknowledgment of perceptions is the first step in rebuilding any reputation , and his choice to bring his fianceé forward is smart			0
" " his past and his present relationship with her is an unavoidable issue in this race			0
it 's best that he acknowledge it , deal with it on his terms rather than let others define it for him			0
otherwise , silence is hiding , and hiding is guilt , and guilt is losing , " added @entity185 , who served as chief of staff for former @entity208 rep. @entity208 of @entity13 , and as a staff member for former @entity7 gov. @entity210			1
@entity185 thinks @entity1 can win a race that focuses on policy , but says a race on personality will be much harder to win			2
@entity7 strategist @entity219 , who served as executive director of the @entity221 , agreed			0
" it 's going to be virtually impossible for @entity1 to attack @entity16 , " said @entity219 , who worked for @entity224 rival state sen. @entity222 in the primary			1
" it 's extremely tricky political territory for several reasons : one , @entity1 ca n't effectively execute an apology tour and consistently be on the attack ; two , any political attack on @entity16 would be used against @entity1 and the party as proof of a perceived ' war on women ; ' three , we have a huge problem right now with the women vote -- so any candidate perceived to be one who disregards women -- is going to face issues getting votes			1
" but the geography of the district may be in @entity1 's favor			1
" the new @entity116 is a coastal area , so it 's generally the most socially liberal of @entity13 's @entity7 - held districts , " @entity185 said			1
" this is because coastal communities are historically more diverse and concerned about issues like the environment that carry less importance inland			0

disgraced former gov. @entity1 won a runoff for @entity66 seat in @entity13
he *'ll* now face @entity260 @entity16 , sister of " @entity261 " star
national *democrats* started attacks against @entity1 shortly after tuesday 's win
while @entity7 acknowledges @entity1 's *liabilities* , his district might be more forgiving than others
