-- @entity1 was registered as a sex offender , regularly visited by parole officers and fitted with an ankle bracelet to track his movements -- but nothing prevented him from being around children , according to a victims ' advocacy group			2
@entity1 , a registered sex offender , was arraigned in @entity11 on friday			0
@entity12 is charged with kidnapping @entity1 in 1991 , when she was 11 , and raping her over the course of years			1
police say @entity15 lived in a huddle of tents and outbuildings hidden behind @entity12 's home , and gave birth to two daughters , now 11 and 15 , fathered by @entity12			1
@entity12 and his wife @entity22 were arrested last week			1
both have pleaded not guilty			0
" here we have a guy who is essentially under every kind of supervision we allow			0
law enforcement had every tool available to them , and [ the tools ] failed , " said @entity27 , spokesman for the @entity28			2
@entity33 , spokesman for the state @entity34 , said a parole officer visited @entity12 at his home , sometimes unannounced , twice a month			1
@entity12 was also required to go to the agent 's office once or twice a month , @entity33 said			1
@entity12 wore a @entity41 anklet , and his movements were tracked passively , @entity33 said , meaning parole officers checked his location after the fact , as opposed to active monitoring , which involves watching parolees ' comings and goings in real time			1
despite the tight supervision , @entity12 " was technically allowed to be around minors , " @entity27 said , because his parole stemmed from the november 1976 rape of @entity55 , who was 25 at the time of the assault			1
he was sentenced in 1977 to 50 years at the federal penitentiary in @entity59 , @entity60 , for kidnapping , because he abducted @entity55 in @entity11 and transported her across the state line to @entity63 , @entity64 , where he raped her in a warehouse , according to court documents			0
a @entity64 court separately sentenced him to five years to life for the rape conviction , the @entity69 reported			0
while in prison in 1978 , @entity12 sent a handwritten letter to judge @entity75 , saying he was recovering from seven years of lsd use and progressing well			1
" i am so ashamed of my past			0
but my future is now in controle [ sic ] , " he wrote			0
court documents show @entity12 requested that his 50 - year sentence be reduced to 25 , making him eligible for parole in eight years , " where he could be released to the state of @entity64 as an educated person and being a rehabilitated person			1
" according to a 1978 court transcript , attorney @entity90 told a judge , " without the influence of any of this drug involvement , i think mr. @entity95 would pause before carrying out sexual fantasies			2
" after more than a decade at @entity59 , @entity12 received a federal parole but was sent to @entity98 , @entity64 , in january 1988 to serve his rape sentence			1
however , according to the @entity69 , he was automatically eligible for state parole because of the time served in federal prison			1
the @entity103 indicates he appeared four times before the parole board , which granted his request in august 1988 , about 11 years after he was incarcerated			2
he moved to @entity106 , @entity11			0
three years later , 11 - year - old @entity15 was abducted from her home in @entity109 , @entity11 , about 100 miles northeast			0
" he served about 20 percent of his sentence , and it does n't take a mathematician to figure out if he served only one - third of his sentence , @entity1 does n't end up in the predicament that she 's in , " said @entity110 , a crime victims ' advocate in @entity112 , @entity113			2
citing revised federal sentencing guidelines , @entity110 and @entity121 defense attorney @entity120 concur that this is not something that could happen today			0
" if he got 50 years , say , he would have 600 months			0
he would only get 50 months off			0
he would do 550 months , " @entity120 said			0
" so this would not be repeated in the federal system again			0
" added @entity110 , " you 're going to have to do at least a minimum of half of your term without any good time credits before you can even see the light of day or say hello to a parole board member			1
" in 1993 , five years after his release from a @entity64 prison , @entity12 was jailed on a parole violation , but it 's unclear what that offense was			1
@entity140 , spokesman for the @entity141 , said documents have been requested and should be available later this week			2
@entity12 was released later that year			1
@entity11 took over his parole supervision in 1999 , @entity33 said , but regular visits did nothing to unearth @entity15 's abduction or @entity12 's backyard secrets			1
another visit by law enforcement was the direct result of a 2006 call a neighbor made to 911 , reporting that women and children were living in tents behind @entity12 's house			1
@entity158 sheriff @entity157 said he did n't think the deputy who responded knew at the time that @entity12 was a sex offender and the deputy spoke to @entity12 in the home 's front yard			1
" we should have been more inquisitive , more curious and turned over a rock or two , " the sheriff said			0
" we missed an opportunity to bring earlier closure to this situation			0
" @entity33 acknowledged that neighbors called police again with a similar complaint in 2008			0
to his knowledge , @entity33 said , the deputy did n't contact @entity12 's parole officer in either instance			1
even if the deputy had made contact , there is no guarantee the parole officer would have found the compound			1
it was that well - hidden , @entity33 said			0
" if you were to walk in the backyard , you would see a fence that ran from one end to the other , " @entity33 said , describing how the fence created the illusion of a " false backyard			1
" " it would not be immediately apparent that [ the tents and outbuildings were ] back there , " he said			0
@entity110 partially blames the economics of the criminal justice system -- not just in @entity11 , but nationwide -- and said @entity12 likely became less of a priority as the time since his crimes passed			1
despite the heinous nature of @entity201 's 1976 crime , it paled in comparison to allegedly holding a young girl hostage and raping her for 18 years , @entity27 said			0
" nothing in this guy 's case history indicated he was capable of such evil , if you will , " he said			0
" it was so far out of the picture , they did n't even look for it			2
" rather than there not being enough money to fund the proper supervision of parolees , it 's more a matter of priorities , @entity27 said , citing the gps device @entity12 wore on his ankle			1
although @entity28 has no official tally , it estimates @entity11 has spent roughly $ 500 million on gps devices for 6,600 of the state 's sex offenders			2
@entity12 was fitted with a device after 2006 when voters ok 'd a law requiring felony sex offenders to wear tracking devices for life			2
" we know where this guy is , so we think we 're safe , " he said , " but the place where we knew he was was the place where he was offending			0
@entity41 just tells you where they are			0
it does n't tell you what they 're doing			2
" each dollar spent on gps equipment " is one dollar you 're not spending on real , traditional parole techniques , like talking to collateral contacts and neighbors , " he said			2
@entity27 also criticized the lack of communication across jurisdictions			0
had @entity12 's parole officer received a call from police and spoken to the neighbor who made the 911 call in 2006 , authorities might have found @entity15 three years earlier , @entity27 said			1
@entity33 said the officer who flushed out @entity12 's alleged crimes had only been supervising him since december			1
when the officer learned from campus police that @entity12 had 11 - and 15 - year - old girls in tow while proselytizing at the @entity267 , he called @entity12 in for a meeting			1
@entity12 arrived with his wife , @entity15 and the two girls			2
@entity33 would not provide details of the conversation -- it could affect the investigation and prosecution , he said -- but he did say @entity12 and his wife were not forthcoming about @entity15 's and the girls ' identities			2
it was the parole officer 's diligence that ultimately yielded the @entity282 ' arrest and @entity15 and her daughters ' freedom			1
said @entity33 , " they were coming in being elusive and deceptive about their identities , and the agent would not let go			0
" @entity0 's @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			0
