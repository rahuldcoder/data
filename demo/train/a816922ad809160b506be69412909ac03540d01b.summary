-- @entity2 tight end @entity1 is the 2012 @entity3			0
why ? in large part because of @entity1 's tireless commitment to ending domestic violence			1
as a former professional football player and longtime domestic violence prevention advocate , i understand how gratifying it is to receive this honor from the @entity12			1
for the men engaged in this critical issue , it can be a lonely road			2
but now @entity1 has company in @entity18			0
moved to action by a series of recent slayings , mayor @entity19 announced the launch of a citywide awareness campaign to show that domestic violence — and the culture that ignores or perpetuates it — has no home in his city			1
he 's hoping at least 10,000 men show up to rally with that message on @entity18 ' @entity32 later this month			2
a drive to end domestic violence , led by men			1
it 's an idea whose time has come , again and again ; some men have been pushing it for decades			2
but now many are hearing the call			0
related : beyond vomiting , how to prevent rape as @entity41 said in a recent press conference : " in the past this has been viewed as a women 's issue , but it ai n't			2
" the problem is not confined to a shocking spate of killings in @entity18 , or to one major @entity52 city			0
the @entity53 reportedly receives 700 domestic violence calls every day			1
domestic violence costs the @entity52 more than $ 9 billion a year			1
more than 603 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not a crime			1
globally , at least one in three women and girls are beaten or sexually abused in their lifetimes , usually at the hands of men			1
what can men do ? men do not just need to stop being violent			2
the vast majority of men are not violent			2
but men do need to stop being silent			2
calling violence against women , whether street harassment or sexual harassment or rape or murder , a " women 's issue " allows men to ignore it as if we have no responsibility for it or stake in ending it			1
we all have grandmothers , mothers , sisters , daughters and female friends and colleagues			0
our lives are inextricably interwoven ; women 's issues of safety and equality directly affect our lives as men			1
beyond that , women are humans , with the same rights to safety and freedom as men			1
it is therefore our moral responsibility to not remain silent or passively on the sidelines , but to be actively engaged in confronting this problem in every corner of homes , communities and societies			0
many men have already taken action			2
men marched with women protesting december 's notorious gang rape and murder in @entity119			1
men worked with women to stop sexual abuse of women in @entity125 's @entity124			1
men joined women in pushing for a serious response to allegations of gang rape in @entity131 , @entity132 ( and the social media vileness that followed )			1
here in @entity135 , men have produced excellent videos calling on other men to stop street harassment			2
i 've been working since 1994 to bring men in as leaders and partners in stopping violence against women			1
today , i believe we stand on the brink of a global tipping point			0
from @entity18 to @entity119 , the world is paying attention			0
now is the time to stand up			0
that 's why i 'm joining breakthrough , the global human rights group , in its " one million men			1
" starting march 8 , over one year we will secure promises from men around the world to take concrete action toward stopping violence against women			1
what can you do ? you do n't have to be a mayor or an @entity12 player to have a major impact			0
you do n't have to be like the @entity135 firefighters who recently tackled the guy attacking his wife with a meat cleaver in broad daylight			0
@entity174 — even non- " heroic " — actions add up			0
make violence against women unacceptable			1
you can start with the discrimination and inequality that create the conditions in which violence happens			0
you can call out a friend who makes a comment that disrespects women			0
you can treat women well in front of boys and men who look up to you			1
we all , men and women , can reject the script that gets played out in media every day that tells our boys to be unemotional and violent while objectifying girls at increasingly younger ages			1
the profound presence of media in our lives has only led to young people being exposed earlier and more often to salacious and sexual content			0
this media bombardment desensitizes our boys and girls to the reality of violence that is anything but the subtext of a life			0
our silence only validates that script			0
we can speak out against it			0
you can make sure your workplace 's sexual harassment prevention polices are up to date			0
if you hear things getting violent next door , you can ring the bell or call the doorman or the cops			0
you can show that giving a damn about equality makes you a better man			0
together , men and women can build a safer world for all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			2

@entity232 : not enough men speak out against domestic violence against women
he says violence toward women affects men , too . yet culture ignores , *propagates* it
he says campaign " one million men . one million promises , " to draw attention to it
@entity232 : men can help in many small ways . set example in treatment of women
