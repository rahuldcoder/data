@entity3 , 58 , is a former federal prosecutor and served as deputy attorney general during the @entity9 administration			1
his confirmation makes him the first @entity12 confirmed to the post , though he held the job on an acting basis in early 2001			1
monday 's vote leaves him set to take over a @entity6 battered by a series of controversies during the @entity20 administration , from questions about how it laid legal groundwork for harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists to the sackings of top federal prosecutors in several cities			1
" there 's a big job to do , and it 's going to be mr. @entity3 's duty to turn this department around and restore its credibility , " said sen. @entity29 , @entity30			1
during confirmation hearings , @entity36 questioned his role in former president @entity9 's widely criticized last - minute pardon of fugitive financier @entity40 and questioned whether he would be independent of the @entity41			0
@entity3 had a testy exchange with the @entity43 's ranking @entity36 , @entity44 , who questioned @entity3 's " fitness " for the office			2
@entity3 shot back that @entity44 was " getting close to the line in questioning my integrity , " and @entity44 ultimately supported the nomination			2
but sen. @entity51 , @entity52 , cited the pardons and what he called @entity3 's insufficient support for gun rights in opposing the nomination			2
" mr. @entity3 is supportive of old ideas for gun control that have never made people safer at the expense of taking away their rights , " @entity51 said			2
@entity43 chairman @entity63 pointed out that the chamber 's @entity36 membership backed @entity20 administration attorney general @entity66 , who was forced out in late 2007			1
the @entity36 also did not condemn the former president 's commutation of the prison term facing @entity72 aide @entity71 , who was convicted of obstructing justice and lying to federal agents probing the 2003 disclosure of a @entity78 agent 's identity			0
" i do n't recall any republicans objecting to that , " said @entity63 , @entity79			0
" instead , they 're objecting to something president @entity9 did			0
i do n't want to suggest in any way that the objections are partisan , but they certainly are n't consistent			0
" all 21 of the " no " votes were @entity36 , but more than a dozen @entity36 senators joined @entity89 in confirming @entity3			0
sen. @entity90 , @entity91 , said @entity3 convinced him he would be " looking forward to keeping the nation safe			0
" @entity90 , the ranking @entity36 on the @entity93 , raised concerns that the administration would seek to prosecute @entity97 officials involved in using what the @entity20 administration called " alternative " interrogation techniques , measures critics said involved the torture of prisoners in @entity97 custody			0
@entity3 unambiguously called the use of waterboarding against suspected terrorists a form of torture that violated the @entity109 , but he has said that prosecuting intelligence officials who followed @entity6 guidance would be " difficult			1
" @entity90 said that while @entity3 's answer focused on @entity97 officials who were following the administration 's legal advice , " i told him , and i believe he understood , that trying to prosecute these lawyers or political leaders would generate a political firestorm			0
