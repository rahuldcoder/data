@entity0 , @entity1 -- several civilians and scores of police officers were injured friday when pro-monarchy supporters clashed with hard - line @entity8 activists in this city a half hour northeast of the capital			1
the confrontation between government loyalists with dozens of @entity14 jihadists -- followers of a strict interpretation of @entity8 who advocate jihad -- brought a violent end to what had been a largely peaceful demonstration during which protesters demanded the release of 200 jihadists being held in @entity1 prisons			1
the incident occurred as vehicles carrying @entity14 activists came under a barrage of stones as they were leaving the city , the birthplace of former @entity33 in @entity35 leader @entity34			0
as the clashes between stone - hurling loyalists and knife - wielding @entity14 escalated , police fired tear gas to disperse them and traded a volley of stones with @entity14 supporters , witnesses said			0
after the incident , @entity1 public security department chief @entity44 told reporters that 83 police officers sustained injuries -- including knife wounds -- in what he described as a " premeditated attack " by the @entity14			1
of the total , 32 officers suffered smoke inhalation due to misfired tear gas , he added			0
@entity56 , a senior leader of the @entity1 @entity14 movement , denied that there had been any premeditated attack , insisting that protesters picked up arms only in self - defense after coming under attack by pro-monarchy supporters			1
" we were observing our right to peacefully express our opinions when we were attacked by plain - clothed security agents , " @entity56 told @entity2			0
he added that two members and a senior leader of the movement were hospitalized with mild to severe injuries following the incident			0
@entity56 vowed that @entity1 's jihadists will continue to demonstrate in the streets until their demands are met			1
" our demands are pure and just and clear : we want our brothers freed from prison and to be governed by the @entity79 , which most @entity1 support , " @entity56 said			2
" you can attack us , you can imprison us , but you ca n't stop the will of the @entity8 nation			0
" during friday 's two - hour demonstration , held at @entity0 's @entity84 , some 1,000 participants chanted slogans including " the people want @entity89 law , " " down with @entity90 , " and " no to democracy , no to racism , no to globalism , only @entity8			2
" @entity14 jihadists are among several groups taking advantage of newfound freedom in @entity1 , holding demonstrations across the country over the past month , calling for the release of imprisoned jihadists , and for the implementation of @entity89 law			1
unlike pro-democracy activists who have held weekly demonstrations across the @entity105 since early january , @entity14 reject calls for political reform as they view the @entity1 regime as " un-islamic			1
" the scene in @entity110 was more peaceful			2
there , more than 1,000 people marched friday demanding democratic and economic reforms , protesting corruption and calling for social justice and constitutional changes			2
the protesters , from many political parties and opposition groups , took to the streets of the capital city demanding governmental and constitutional reforms and an end to what many call government corruption amid tight security from hundreds of police and security personnel			1
@entity129 , 66 , a leader of the @entity130 -- one of the main political parties demanding reform -- said that , amid ongoing revolutions across the @entity136 world , @entity1 too want change			2
" today with the revolutions sweeping the @entity136 world , @entity1 are taking to the street asking for the same slogans , freedom , social justice , because after the signing of the @entity144 with @entity145 , things have been deteriorating , " @entity129 said			2
the 1994 treaty normalized relations between the two countries			0
" now we are asking to reform the system , freedom rights for legalizing political parties and for getting rid of the current political parties law , calling ( for ) and demanding free elections under the auspices of the judiciary control , reform of the constitution			0
... this should be done through national dialogue and by the king to assure this will be implemented , " she added			0
local media reported similar protests friday in other cities , including @entity167 in the south and @entity169 in the north			2
@entity1 have held regular protests since january			0
most of them , unlike demonstrators in @entity136 countries that have seen uprisings , have not been seeking regime change but changes to the regime			0
in february , @entity180 sacked his prime minister and cabinet and instituted a number of economic measures and promises of political reform in an effort to appease those demands			0
but the protesters ' list of demands grew longer as many @entity1 felt emboldened by the popular uprisings in the region			1
although the protests in @entity110 have been largely peaceful , more than 100 people were injured and one person died last month when pro-government loyalists attacked anti government protesters with sticks and stones			1
a @entity2 team at the protest reported that police forces used water cannon and batons to disperse a sit - in in a main @entity110 square			1
