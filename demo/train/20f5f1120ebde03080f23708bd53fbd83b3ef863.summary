-- on the one hand , there 's the need to respect and protect people 's constitutional right to congregate and express their opinions			1
on the other , there 's the need to make sure all people and all property are safe and secure			0
but , if and when these responsibilities ' conflict , where do you draw the line ? that 's a question authorities in @entity17 , @entity18 , are having to answer this weekend			1
in fact , they 've had to answer it every day and night since 18 - year - old @entity22 was shot dead by a police officer			1
the shooting stirred anger , indignation and emotional , expansive , racially - charged protests			1
at times , these protests have been followed by looting -- as happened overnight friday -- and confrontations with police			1
" if there was an easy way to separate those who hurt from those who helped , we would			0
but it 's hard , " gov. @entity38 said			0
" and sometimes , especially at night , we ca n't			0
" acknowledging " the balance is important " between maintaining security and protecting the @entity42 right to free speech and peaceable assembly , @entity38 on saturday decided that -- for five hours daily , at least -- security will take precedence			2
he 's instituted a curfew for @entity17 to last between midnight and 5 a.m. governor imposes curfew in @entity17 " this is not to silence the people of @entity17 or this region or others , but to contain those who are drowning out the voice of the people with their actions , " @entity38 said			1
" we will not allow a handful of looters to endanger the rest of this community			0
" his decision stirred instant indignation among many gathered at the community meeting where he announced it			0
some screamed out that authorities ' priority should be to provide justice to @entity22 's family , not to clamp down on those calling for it			2
@entity74 is one of those protesters who do n't think the curfew makes sense , accusing authorities of being focused more on intimidating people than addressing their core concerns and calls for justice			2
the order might further fuel residents ' animosity by giving the implication that police do n't trust them to be on the streets			1
beyond that , @entity88 simply thinks having a curfew wo n't work -- and , in fact , might make things worse for community - police relations if it leads to confrontations			2
" they 're not going to do this , " @entity88 said of people abiding by the curfew			0
" you have people who -- at this point -- do not care what authorities say right now			2
" rebuilding trust seen as key the shooting of @entity22 spurred animosity among @entity17 residents toward their police force			1
the fact that @entity22 was black while the man who shot him , officer @entity110 , is white added fuel to the tension			0
the police response in the days afterward did n't help , with some criticizing it as too militarized and heavy - handed			1
nor did @entity17 police chief @entity116 's decision to release video and documents calling @entity22 the " primary suspect " in the robbery of a box of cigars from a convenience store , only to add hours later that this robbery was n't related to why @entity110 confronted the teenager			1
multiple officials -- from @entity128 attorney general @entity127 to @entity130 capt. @entity129 , who has been overseeing the security in @entity17 since thursday -- have spoken about the need to rebuild trust in the community for law enforcement			1
but as community members ' shouting down of @entity129 and the governor at a meeting saturday illustrated , it has n't happened yet			0
the situation did appear to calm significantly thursday , when @entity129 literally and figuratively embraced the protesters rather than confront them			0
then came friday night and early saturday morning , violence that @entity88 said she believes was " instigated by the police officers themselves ( who ) were in their militant stance against the people			1
" at that point , the people were like , ' wow , we 're supposed to have our freedom			0
we 're supposed to be able to do this			0
and you 're still being very aggressive			0
' " ex-fbi official : ' no choice ' but to have curfew there are also those who think police were n't aggressive enough as men looted stores around @entity17 overnight friday			1
while some activists criticized authorities for using armored vehicles and tear gas in one instance , on the other side store owners ripped police for not stepping in and arresting those responsible			1
not being as aggressive could invite more criminal acts in @entity17 , claims @entity172 , a former @entity173 assistant director and @entity0 law enforcement analyst			1
" if i was a police officer on the street once again in that situation , i 'd be scared that the message went out to all the hooligans in the greater @entity180 area , if you need a new tv set or you need something , come to town because we 're not going to stop you when you start looting stores , " @entity172 said			2
" that 's a horrible message to send			0
" in @entity172 ' opinion , authorities had " no choice " but to institute and enforce a curfew			2
a full week in , the situation has not gotten much better -- as the unrest overnight friday shows			0
as @entity195 police chief @entity194 said , " there is no excuse for looting to be going on six days later in a community in the @entity128			2
" if people go after more stores , what are police supposed to do ? if they throw rocks or @entity207 cocktails at police , what 's wrong with having them wear riot gear and armored equipment ? and , the bottom line , how long can this go on before authorities step in and clear the streets ? if the protesters aim to get their message out and , in so doing , get justice for @entity22 , then " we must first have and maintain peace , " @entity38 said			1
and having a curfew should help in that regard , he argued			0
" the eyes of the world are watching , " the governor added			0
" this is a test of ( whether ) a community -- this community , any community -- can break the cycle of fear , distrust and violence and replace them with peace , strength and ultimately justice			2
" @entity195 chief : some residents must ' stand up ' will @entity17 pass that test ? will residents and the police come to see other as being part of the same solution , rather than seeing each other as the problem ? a big part on how that relationship turns out might depend on what happens with officer @entity110 , including whether he 's charged and / or convicted in @entity22 's shooting			1
but beyond that , the most important thing all parties must do is talk , @entity194 said			0
" their needs to be words of healing , " the @entity195 police chief said of what police and other officials must express			2
" there needs to be a strategic dialogue that is aimed at resolution and reconciliation			0
" it 's not all on police , though			2
the people of @entity17 -- especially the leaders among them -- also have a responsibility to speak up , act out and take care of their community , according to @entity194			1
that means working with police as partners , not as adversaries , for the common good			0
" there needs to be some people that stand up , " @entity194 told @entity0			0
" ... the people in @entity17 that stand for justice and stand for peace need to be in the trenches with law enforcement , right now			1
" what 's next as authorities probe @entity17 shooting ?			1

@entity17 , @entity18 , has seen large protests , some violence
residents are angry over police shooting a teen , the police response afterward
authorities say they respect rights to assemble , but also have a duty to maintain security
