@entity0 -- the meltdowns of three reactors at @entity6 's @entity5 nuclear power plant may have happened more than two years ago , but the disaster remains a giant , unresolved mess			1
an earthquake in 2011 triggered a tsunami which slammed into the plant , disabling it			0
the threat of radiation forced neighbors to evacuate and many still ca n't return to their homes			2
authorities face many challenges before they can make the facility safe again for the long term			2
explainer : @entity5 update here are five of the biggest questions still out there : 1			1
how dangerous for your health is @entity5 ? data published in august shows 44 out of 216,809 children under age 18 in @entity5 prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid cancer or suspected of having the disease			1
the figure is far higher than the international average but opinions are split as to whether this is because of the nuclear accident or because of more sensitive screening			1
also , health experts say it takes years after radiation exposure to develop thyroid cancer , which suggests the cause of the cancer may predate the tsunami			2

what can you do with radioactive water ? the most immediate problem for plant operator @entity52 is the hundreds of tons of water poured over the damaged nuclear reactors every single day to keep the molten fuel cool			1
if the fuel is not kept cool , it could cause another disaster			2
that radioactive water then needs to be stored safely			1
but several on - site water storage tanks that were originally designed to be temporary have sprung leaks			0
@entity52 said last summer that as much as 300 tons of toxic groundwater was seeping into the @entity64 every day , sparking fears about radioactive contamination of fish , which are a major food source			0
read more about the leaks more about @entity6 - spawned tuna caught off the @entity71 3			0
is it safe to remove spent fuel rods ? @entity52 is just days away from starting to remove 1,500 irradiated spent fuel rods from a pool in reactor number 4 to a safer location			2
the building was damaged by a hydrogen blast after the disaster			0
removing fuel from a severely damaged pool has never been attempted			0
critics fear the building is unstable and any mistake could cause a new nuclear disaster			0
read more about removing the fuel rods 4			0
how do you remove molten fuel in melted down reactors ? the radiation levels in reactors 1 , 2 and 3 are so high that the area is inaccessible to humans			1
no one knows for sure where the molten core is resting within the basements of the buildings and how far it has penetrated through their floors			0
the technology does not exist to remove this molten fuel			1
how do you stop running out of skilled labor ? workers within the @entity5 nuclear power plant have a radiation exposure limit			1
once they reach this limit they can no longer work on site and new workers need to be found			0
as time goes on , more experienced workers will reach their exposure limits , sparking concerns that available workers will have decreased skill levels .			0

@entity5 officials must figure out what to do with *increasing* amounts of radioactive water
there are questions about lingering effects for *people* near the facility during meltdowns
experts do n't know exactly how to remove molten nuclear fuel from the melted down reactors
