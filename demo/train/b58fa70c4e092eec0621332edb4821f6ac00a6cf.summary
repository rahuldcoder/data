@entity0 , @entity1 -- four weeks to the day since @entity4 went missing , the search is set to continue saturday -- both on the surface of the southern @entity6 and deep below it			1
time is fast ticking down to find the missing @entity9 's locator pingers : if functioning as expected , their batteries will run out of juice monday			1
the @entity14 survey ship @entity15 and the @entity1 naval supply ship @entity17 began scouring about 6,500 feet to 13,000 feet deep on the ocean floor on friday along a single 150 - mile ( 240 - kilometer ) track , said retired air chief marshal @entity20 , the head of the @entity1 agency coordinating the search			1
the @entity17 has high - tech gear borrowed from the @entity24			2
that includes a @entity26 - 21 , which can scour the ocean floor for wreckage , and a @entity28 25 , with its underwater microphone to detect pings from the jet 's voice and data recorders as deep as 20,000 feet ( 6,100 meters )			1
" it is a very slow proceeding , " @entity35 capt. @entity34 said of the second tool , which is towed behind a vessel typically moving at 1 to 5 knots			0
said @entity40 , an @entity1 scientist who worked on developing flight data recorders : " if they do find it , i think it 'll be remarkable			1
" up to 10 military planes and three civilian aircraft -- in addition for 11 ships -- will be looking saturday for any sign of flight 370 , according to the @entity1 government			1
the search area will be just under 84,000 square miles ( 217,000 square kilometers ) , which is slightly less than the area searched friday , and will focus some 1,050 miles northwest of @entity0			1
this is about 50 miles further from the western @entity1 city than was the case a day earlier			1
is this the right spot ? will they find anything ? so far , all efforts to locate signs of the airliner have proven unsuccessful			1
still , those involved have vowed to keep trying			0
" really , the best we can do right now is put these assets in the best location -- the best guess we have -- and kind of let them go , " @entity64			0
" until we get conclusive evidence of debris , it is just a guess			0
" ' long way to go ' officials have repeatedly warned that the massive international search to find signs of the @entity80 - to - @entity81 flight may not conclude any time soon			1
" we 've still got a long way to go , " @entity20 said friday			0
in the case of @entity84 , which crashed into the @entity85 in 2009 , officials found debris on the surface after five days of searching			0
but it took them nearly two years to find the main pieces of wreckage , the flight recorders and many of the bodies of those on board			0
with flight 370 , the search teams have even fewer clues			1
on thursday , @entity1 prime minister @entity98 warned that " we can not be certain of ultimate success in the search " for the @entity103 aircraft			1
he described it as the most difficult search " in human history			1
" authorities have yet to explain why the plane flew off course or where it ended up ; investigations into the 227 passengers and 12 crew members have yielded no suggestion that any of them might have been behind the disappearance			1
6 missteps in the investigation families ' frustrations @entity103 officials held a briefing for @entity103 relatives of those aboard @entity4 on thursday evening at a @entity80 hotel , but attendees told @entity2 that nothing new had emerged			0
@entity125 , whose cousin @entity126 was a honeymooning groom on the plane , said the three - hour session had felt like a " waste of time			2
" he added , " i was hoping for some news that they had tracked the plane or some parts of it , but nothing like that happened			1
" @entity137 , the father of another passenger , @entity103 civil flight engineer @entity137 , said officials described in detail the satellite data that has led investigators to the current search area			1
" they could not tell us if the plane crashed , " he said			2
" they said they were still looking into it			0
" @entity149 , wife of passenger @entity150 , said after the meeting that the jet 's disappearance still perplexes her			2
" the hardest process for me is understanding that a commercial airliner can just go black , " the @entity154 told @entity2 's @entity155			2
" that someone can just turn off all communications , all matter of tracking an airliner , and it can just disappear			0
and this is the mystery			0
" about the search for the plane , she said , " if it 's there , they will find it			1
but are they in the right place ? it 's all calculations			2
" hanging on to hope weeks said her infant son @entity179 will celebrate his first birthday next month , and their 3 - year - old son , @entity182 , was still coming to grips with their loss			1
" @entity186 was everything for him , " she said			0
" he read @entity182 always his bedtime story , and they had this saying that they 'd say -- you know , ' good night , i love you and see you in the morning for breakfast			1
' " and now he comes out and i tell him that @entity186 is up in the sky , and we come out every night and we find the brightest star			0
we find the brightest star and he says , ' good night , @entity186 , i love you			0
see you in the morning for breakfast			1
' and that breaks my heart			0
" but , four weeks after the plane vanished , she too has not given up on seeing him for breakfast			1
" i know it sounds crazy , but i still have a slight hope , you know , " she said , adding that she will be able to grieve only after confronted by evidence of his death			2
" the grief at this point still has n't started for me , " she said			0
" i have my moments , but until i have evidence , i still do n't know			0
" the partner of @entity24 passenger @entity219 was also among those who attended friday 's meeting			2
" the only thing i learned last night after three hours is that the @entity103 families are more calm and rational than the @entity227 , " @entity222 told @entity2 's @entity223 in an e-mail			2
" but they are equally frustrated and have totally lost faith in the @entity103 government			0
" @entity222 noted that officials have concluded that the jetliner flew over @entity103 " for quite a long time			0
" " it is impossible that this relatively sophisticated military power did n't see it , " she said			2
" they are clearly hiding something			0
we just do n't know what			0
" @entity103 refuses to let families hear the plane 's radio communications the @entity103 @entity245 denied a request by @entity103 families to release the audio recording of radio communications among the pilot , co-pilot and air traffic control , two people who attended the briefing said			1
the department 's chief , @entity254 , told the relatives that even the families of pilot @entity258 and co-pilot @entity4 have not been allowed to listen to the recording because it is part of an ongoing investigation , the two attendees said			1
@entity103 authorities released a transcript of the recording tuesday			0
" this is an event that is so unprecedented and i think that is so significant that it can never be allowed to get off the screens , get off the radar , " @entity266 told @entity2 's @entity267			2
his wife , @entity273 , was on the flight			0
" my concern is that if we do n't really get to the bottom of it , we can not really be certain that we are safe and that we are secure every time we board a flight			0
" @entity17 : a mission of hope in search for @entity4 flight 370 : high - tech search tools inside the flight simulator read the cockpit transcript @entity2 's @entity287 reported from @entity0 , and @entity288 reported and wrote from @entity289			1
@entity2 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity155 and journalist @entity296 contributed to this report .			2

new : up to 10 military planes , 3 civilian planes , 11 ships will be part of saturday 's search
new : the search area shifts slightly further off @entity1 's northwest coast
@entity309 vessels are looking for underwater hoping to locate the plane 's ping
a month later , still holding on to hope : " see you in the morning for breakfast "
