-- a year ago on thursday , the @entity1 failed to pass a bill that would have helped fix our nation 's gun laws by requiring background checks on all purchases of firearms			1
ninety percent of all @entity9 -- and more than 80 % of gun owners -- believe that all people should be subject to such checks			1
and even though the bill won majority support in the @entity1 -- more than 50 members -- it was not enough to break a filibuster			0
but in the year after the massacre at @entity20 , @entity21 , on december 14 , 2012 , the grassroots movement to pass common sense gun laws and policies that are consistent with the @entity25 has made great progress just about everywhere except @entity27			1
in @entity29 , @entity21 , @entity30 and @entity31 , local citizens helped lead the successful push for legislation that closed loopholes in background checks laws			1
in @entity36 and @entity37 , citizens helped pass laws that keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers			0
in @entity29 alone , the new law stopped more than 160 prohibited buyers from getting their hands on a gun , and as @entity46 know too well , it only takes one to devastate a family , a community , a nation			0
and the law has n't gotten in the way of law - abiding gun owners , who bought more firearms in 2013 than in any preceding year			1
we also gave voice to hundreds of thousands of @entity9 who persuaded @entity58 and @entity59 to change their policies so that unlicensed gun sellers can not use their sites to sell guns without background checks			1
these significant victories were won by a growing , nonpartisan coalition that is refusing to wait for @entity27 to act			0
that coalition includes parents , mayors , police chiefs , religious leaders , gun owners and everyday americans of all political persuasions			1
mothers , in particular , have been at the forefront of this fight			0
they 've given testimony at town halls , led " @entity81 " at state capitals , hosted quilting bees and delivered petitions to legislatures and companies across the country			0
to unify the efforts of this diverse coalition of @entity9 , we are launching @entity90 for @entity91 in @entity9 , a new umbrella organization that will be the largest and best - organized counterweight to the gun lobby that has ever been created			1
@entity90 for @entity91 will expand on the work of two existing organizations -- @entity97 and @entity98 -- and take the fight for gun violence prevention policies to every community in the country			1
@entity90 for @entity91 will continue pushing for better background check laws in @entity104 and state houses			2
but we will also broaden our focus to include other issues that are important to @entity9 , like safe storage education campaigns to help keep kids from being killed by unlocked or dangerously stored guns			1
and new laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers			2
and efforts to help reduce the nearly 19,400 suicides that happen every year with guns			0
in each area , we will make progress by doing something that no gun group , other than the @entity120 , has ever done : inform and mobilize voters			2
the reason the @entity120 has political influence -- in addition to its campaign contributions -- is that it has scared elected officials into believing that voters will oppose them unless they follow the @entity120 's @entity27 leadership , which has grown increasingly extreme and increasingly out of touch with its own members			2
@entity131 to spend $ 50 million to challenge @entity120 on guns in fact , the @entity120 's reputation for political strength is wildly blown out of proportion and the election results from three statewide contests in @entity139 this past november reflect that reality			2
candidates who spoke out in support of common sense gun violence prevention policies were elected as governor , lieutenant governor , and attorney general			2
in the attorney general 's race , his campaign manager said that the candidate 's support for sensible stances on gun issues was a major factor in his victory			0
nonetheless , the perception of an unbeatable gun lobby still lingers and part of our mission will be showing candidates and elected officials that the vast majority of @entity9 and gun owners support common sense gun policies that respect the @entity25 and save lives			1
to mobilize voters who are committed to backing candidates that support common sense gun policies , @entity90 for @entity91 is launching a @entity175 campaign			0
before the 2014 midterms , we aim to get at least 1 million @entity9 to pledge to vote for state and federal candidates based on where they stand on gun safety			2
we 'll keep voters informed by tracking candidates ' positions and determining which of them support gun safety and which do not			1
leaders from all walks of life will join us on our board of directors , including one of our nation 's most respected military leaders , adm. @entity191 , former chairman of the @entity194 ; @entity196 president and former sen. @entity197 ; and former secretary of homeland security @entity198			0
all of us are united by the belief that accepting the status quo -- 12,000 americans are murdered with guns every year -- is unconscionable			0
there is no doubt that we have a big hill to climb			0
well - funded , entrenched special interests are always difficult to defeat			0
and for years , the gun lobby has largely had the field to itself			1
@entity90 for @entity91 and its growing grassroots network will be gunning for change that both protects our country and respects our @entity213 .			0

***writers*** : 90 % of @entity9 , 80 % of gun owners want background checks for guns
***writers*** : sensible gun laws fail because of politicians ' irrational fear of the @entity120
***writers*** : *everytown* for @entity227 will show you can support gun control , win elections
@entity232 , @entity98 : the gun lobby no longer has the field to itself
