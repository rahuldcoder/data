a lawyer representing the father of @entity3 's top - rated tennis player @entity2 says @entity4 was acting in self - defense when he headbutted his son 's training partner @entity6 on saturday			1
on monday , @entity4 , who is also his 20 - year - old son 's coach , denied a charge of assault in a @entity12 court which ruled that a judge will decide his guilt or innocence at a hearing on may 14			1
the incident -- which resulted in a broken nose for the @entity19 -- took place on saturday afternoon outside the hotel in the @entity23 capital where players were staying for the @entity25			0
@entity2 was in town to contest the tournament only to suffer a first round at the hands of @entity30 of the @entity31			2
" i do n't feel guilty			0
i did not do anything wrong , " @entity32 told reporters of the fight			0
his lawyer @entity36 said the reason that @entity38 used his head , rather than his arms , to attack @entity6 was because the tennis player , 29 , was holding the coach 's arms at the time			1
in a statement , @entity45 said they were awaiting further details before discussing the incident			0
" obviously media reports regarding a recent incident are very concerning , " the country 's governing tennis body said			0
" we are working closely with @entity55 officials who are investigating the incident and are unable to comment further until the full facts are known			0
" the incident continues the mixed career of @entity2 , ranked 53rd in the world , and who was dropped from his @entity63 side earlier in the year for what @entity3 captain @entity64 called a lack of professionalism			1
the youngster , who broke into the limelight when reaching the quarterfinals of @entity71 as an 18 - year - old , is no stranger to controversy involving his father , with the duo having been involved in several incidents			2
@entity77 - born @entity4 , who moved with his family to @entity3 when @entity2 was three , has been coaching his son since he was 13 , even though a man who used to drive taxis for a living had no previous tennis experience			1
in 2009 , @entity4 was forced to publicly apologize after telling his son to walk off court in the middle of a match against fellow @entity3 @entity87 in @entity88 as he was unhappy with the officiating			1
despite the incident resulting in a one - month ban from the @entity92 , @entity4 was up to old his tricks a year later -- railing at @entity96 tournament director @entity95 so vehemently about the scheduling of one of his son 's matches that security was ultimately placed around the official			2
last year , @entity103 was booed off court at @entity71 , picking up a code violation after smashing his racket , as he made a first round exit before then requesting that his father should be ejected from the stands at the @entity108 later in the year			0
" i know he 's my father but he 's annoying me , " @entity2 , who was ranked as high as world no. 27 last year , stated to the match referee			2
@entity32 has often clashed with @entity45 , having previously threatened to switch his son 's allegiance to @entity77 unless his demands are met			0
matters seemed to be improving as @entity2 won his maiden @entity55 title in january but this latest incident appears to be yet another setback in a stop - start career for a player with a fine record at junior level .			1
