-- @entity1 spans the full spectrum of untethered gadgetry , from the next generation of mobile phone networks to wireless charging technology			0
but it 's always the consumer technology that 's the star			0
we asked @entity12 editor - in - chief @entity11 to analyze the top trends from the show			1
trend 1 : getting the whole world connnected @entity16 used his keynote address to wax lyrical about @entity19 , " a global partnership dedicated to making internet access available to the two - thirds of the world not yet connected			1
" by striking deals with telecommunications companies in emerging markets , @entity19 plans to get basic web services - weather reports , @entity28 , messaging and @entity30 ( naturally , ) to people at no cost , in the hope that it will inspire them to explore the rest of the web and reap the benefits that it can provide			1
and there was plenty of hardware at @entity1 that should help along the way			0
given the deep relationship with @entity45 , many were surprised to see @entity47 's mobile division adopt @entity48 for its new devices , but @entity48 is a platform more suited to the emerging markets at which these three devices are aimed			0
the @entity53 series lacks superstar specifications but do feature dual sim slots , expandable memory and swappable cases , all of which @entity47 's @entity59 devices lack , and all of which it says the developing world wants			2
@entity62 's @entity61 might not be making huge waves in the developed world , but it could be the platform that helps spread smartphone use through emerging markets			2
the company showed off a prototype of a $ 25 smartphone running @entity61 , with @entity70 , @entity71 , camera , and access to @entity75 apps , at a price similar to budget feature phones			2
trend 2 : wellness and wearables the recent trend for the use of fitness trackers looks set to go into overdrive as vendors add features that allow them to harvest even more data about how we go about our daily lives			1
all for our own good , of course			0
@entity95 's flagship @entity93 range is second only to @entity97 's @entity96 in the popularity stakes , but it has been accused of peddling gimmicks in place of meaningful innovations			0
this year 's device majors on robustness , and its ability to get to know you better than you know yourself			2
it is water resistant , and round the back is a heart rate sensor that in conjunction with the @entity113 app can help build a more complete picture of your fitness			2
like the @entity118 , it 'll also scan your fingertips via its home button to provide an extra layer of security , and it can be used to seamlessly authorise @entity124 payments			0
it is also a powerhouse device with a @entity128 video - recording , 16 megapixel camera , super-fast quad - core processor , next - generation 802.11ac @entity70 and a vast 5.1 - inch 1080 pixel screen			1
despite that , @entity95 reckons its new @entity134 mode can give 24 hours of standby from a 10 % battery charge			0
@entity137 's take on the fitness band takes a few cues from smartwatches , providing notifications via haptic feedback and allowing control over the music you 're playing on a connected @entity48 device			1
however , it 's the @entity149 companion app thats the big news - it does n't just track your activity , but it measures how you sleep , where you 've been ( and how fast you went there ) , how much you browse , play music , watch movies and game , and even more besides			1
could be a bit of a wake - up call ( it 'll do that too			2
) @entity95 introduced three wearable devices , the gear 2 and gear 2 @entity162 ( the latter minus a camera , ) and the @entity167 fitness band			2
like the @entity169 smartphone , all three came with the new ability to constantly monitor your heart rate , making them far more useful as training aids			0
trend 3 : go big or go home smartphone screens get bigger every year , but the new normal is now so big that the " phablet " category seems obsolete			1
from now on , if your device does n't have a 5 - inch screen ( or bigger ) , you 're out of date			1
and the trend will only continue as companion devices such as smartwatches give us fewer reasons to fish the whopping gadgets out of our pockets			1
the @entity188 2 has a 5.9 - incn 1080 - pixel screen , a 13 megapixel 4k video - recording camera and huge power , making it an intriguing ( and very , very big ) gadget - but its key innovation is how it reacts when you wrap your knuckles on it			1
a custom combination of taps to lock and unlock the device , replacing @entity48 's standard pin and pattern unlock			2
combinations with up to 8 taps can be created , and there are 80,000 possible combinations of knock according to @entity188			0
crucially , it works when the screen is off - no need to seek out the power button			1
trend 4 : the future tech shows are always a good opportunity to find out what 's on the horizon , and @entity1 2014 did n't disappoint			1
the best technology demonstration at the show came courtesy of @entity220			0
the prototype sensory tablet has ultrasonic inducers on its screen that allow it to vibrate at different frequencies , creating an almost magical level of tactile feedback - it mimics different levels of friction and even creates the illusion of raised surfaces			1
it works wonderfully , and it should come to market in 2015			0
imagine the difference it could make to mobile gaming			0
@entity238 is a @entity240 company that 's been working on augmented reality technology in smartphones for years , but using @entity244 's smart eyewear , it can now provide real - time recognition of objects and faces in the real world , and display relevant data to the wearer in real time			1
this could give rise to an " annotated world " - pass a landmark and immediately be furnished with its history , look at a restaurant and immediately access relevant reviews			1
but it could also allow rich media marketing to be pumped directly into your eye			0
like the one before it , the second generation phone from @entity265 smartphone maker @entity264 has two screens			0
at the front is the usual color lcd touchscreen , but at the back is a secondary e-ink display ( similar to that on an @entity273 ) that only uses power when it refreshes			0
via an app , you tell the secondary display what you want it to show you -- a book , a @entity282 feed , notifications -- and it sits there updating from time to time without you needing to waste time and energy switching your phone back on			0
it 's ingenious , and this year , it 's a good deal slicker than it was			0

connecting the two - thirds of the world without access to the internet is a major theme in @entity309
the recent trend for the use of smartwatches and fitness trackers looks set to go into overdrive
from now on , if your device does n't have a 5 - inch screen ( or bigger ) , you 're out of date . @entity11 says
the future holds developments in tactile feedback , augmented reality , and *multiple* screens , he predicts
