@entity0 -- the @entity2 attempted on tuesday to dismiss more than 200 cases brought by nearly 4,200 retired players who said they were not warned of the dangers of head trauma			1
@entity8 district court judge @entity7 delayed a ruling on the request			1
" i will rule when i sort this out for myself , " she said before adjourning the packed courtroom			0
the class - action lawsuit could determine the league 's role in caring for players with football - related neurodegenerative diseases			1
the players accuse the @entity2 of " deliberately and fraudulently " concealing the dangers of head trauma , and are seeking damages , treatment and medical monitoring for neurological injuries they sustained during their careers			1
the suit alleges the league did n't do enough to warn players that they risked permanent brain damage if they played too soon after a concussion and that it hid evidence about the risks for decades			1
@entity35 listened intently and asked a series of questions of both camps ' high - profile representation during the hearing			0
former @entity2 player wants brain studied @entity43 , former @entity8 solicitor general during the @entity45 administration , represented the @entity2			1
@entity46 , who has argued a number of @entity49 cases , spoke for the retired player plaintiffs			0
high profile attorney @entity51 , who 's represented former @entity53 adviser i. @entity52 , among others , was observing tuesday 's arguments			2
@entity51 is one of the lead trial attorneys who will be representing the @entity2 should this case go to trial			2
the collective bargaining agreements players signed with their respective teams also apply to the @entity2 , @entity43 argued , adding that players receive benefits			1
" this is an unusual industry , " @entity43 said , adding that unlike most corporations , the union , clubs and league " are worried about players			2
" " this is a case about workplace safety , " he added			0
in contrast , @entity46 argued passionately that the @entity2 does not have immunity in all cases , especially those players who played while collectively bargaining agreements were in limbo from 1987 to 1993			1
moreover , the @entity2 actively concealed the risks associated with repetitive impacts to the head , he said			1
the league did n't do anything about the injuries because they " did n't cause bleeding or broken bones , " he said			2
" the @entity2 had held itself out to be the guarantor of safety			2
... when the @entity2 began to glorify and monetize violence on the field , its breached its duty of due care			2
" a tale of two former @entity2 players and their brains last april , @entity94 , the former @entity95 standout who starred in the 1980s sitcom " @entity97 , " joined hundreds of former @entity2 players suing the league over concussion - related injuries			1
@entity94 , who also played the horse - punching @entity101 in the 1974 movie " @entity104 , " served as lead plaintiff for what was then the 12th concussion - related complaint filed against the @entity2 by the @entity108 in @entity0			2
since then , the suits have been consolidated			0
he died in october following a battle with dementia , kidney disease , heart disease and stomach cancer			2
the suits claim that plaintiffs suffer from neurological problems after sustaining traumatic impacts to the head			2
@entity94 , for instance , " sustained repetitive traumatic impacts to his head and / or concussions on multiple occasions " during his @entity2 career , and " suffers from various neurological conditions and symptoms related to the multiple head traumas , " according to the suit , filed before his death			1
last year , @entity94 ' wife and " @entity97 " co-star @entity134 said his dementia " prevents him from doing everyday activities , such as driving , cooking , sports fishing , reading books and going to big events or traveling			0
" " his constant complaint is dizziness -- the result of multiple concussions , " she said in a statement			0
" what @entity94 wants is for the game of football to be made safer and allow players and their families to enjoy a healthier , happier retirement			0
" critics say players traded the risk of injury for gridiron glory , while the @entity2 asserts there 's a shared risk in playing football			1
former running back @entity163 said tuesday he knows a thing or two about " having my bell rung			0
" " we did n't know better			0
it 's plain and simple , " said @entity163 , who played for @entity167 and @entity0			0
" we knew there 'd be some aches and pains , some joints and some ligaments , that may be damaged , and we signed up for that , fine			0
... not being able to remember , i did n't sign up for that			0
" @entity2 spokesman @entity177 told @entity1 at the time the suits were filed that , " any allegation that the @entity2 intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit			1
" " it stands in contrast to the league 's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions , " @entity177 wrote in an e-mail			1
" the @entity2 has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so			2
" @entity194 , @entity195 planning $ 100 million player study but , said players ' attorney @entity204 at the time , " ( the @entity2 ) had knowledge they did n't share with the players and did n't add the knowledge to the playing rules to protect players from head injuries			1
what we want is for the league to stand up and be counted , and examine everyone and provide medical benefits to everyone			0
" in recent years , the @entity2 has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field , adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to more independently evaluate injured players			1
in 2005 , the league banned the practice of tackling a player by grabbing his shoulder pads , a move commonly referred to as a " horse - collar " tackle , after concluding it commonly resulted in injury			0
it also recently strengthened a 1979 rule that prohibits players from using their helmets to butt , or " spear " players during a tackle -- a rule that critics had often complained lacked official enforcement			0
players such as @entity238 linebacker @entity237 have since faced hefty and repeated fines for helmet - first tackles			0
others have called for added protections , however , following a series of high - profile incidents involving former players ' health			0
in may 2011 , scientists announced that an autopsy of the brain of former @entity251 safety @entity250 , 50 , who died from a self - inflicted gunshot wound , showed evidence of " moderately advanced " chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity255			1
@entity2 linebacker @entity256 -- who also took his own life last may -- suffered from a neurodegenerative brain disease that can develop from concussions known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy or @entity255			1
@entity255 is a degenerative , dementia - like brain disease linked to repeated brain trauma			1
the disease has been found in the brains of 33 of 34 former @entity2 players , including @entity250 , studied at the @entity266 for the @entity267 as of last may			1
their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both			0
scan may detect signs of @entity2 players ' brain disease a brain with @entity255 is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau			1
under a microscope , tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia			0
but the cases of @entity255 have shown this progressive , dementia - like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis , which typically occurs when people are in their 70s or 80s			1
several @entity2 players , including @entity295 and @entity296 , have said they want to donate their brains for research upon their deaths			1
so does @entity300 , a former fullback for @entity0 and @entity301			0
@entity300 suffers from @entity302 , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as @entity305 's disease			2
@entity300 believes the @entity302 results from blows to the head he received while in the @entity2			1
he also wants to donate his spinal cord after he dies			0
judge @entity35 did not indicate how long it would take for a final decision on whether or not the suit goes to trial			0
but @entity300 said he and others ca n't wait too long for a ruling			2
@entity1 's @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 and @entity322 contributed to this report .			0

more than 4,000 former players say they were n't warned of head trauma dangers
a judge has delayed ruling on the @entity2 's request
the players want damages , treatment and medical monitoring
researchers are making strides in the study of the brain disease @entity255
