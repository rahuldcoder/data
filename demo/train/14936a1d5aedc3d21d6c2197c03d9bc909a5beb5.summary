@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 cable television providers dropped a channel sunday that has been critical of president @entity5 , citing violation of broadcast laws			1
@entity8 , which lost its broadcasting license in 2007 and became a cable - only channel , disappeared shortly after midnight on saturday			1
@entity8 was the only station that did not air the entire speech of @entity5 during pro-government marches earlier on saturday			1
@entity15 , director of the national agency regulating electronic media , had called on cable and satellite providers to stop offering channels deemed to be in violation of the law			1
@entity15 said @entity8 did not broadcast the @entity1 national anthem as required and failed to provide warnings before programs featuring violence			1
the channel denied the violations in a news release sunday			0
it said the move to drop it was illegal and questioned the @entity33 ' authority to regulate subscription - based tv			1
the government " illegally targeted the subscription services by asking them to exclude @entity38 's signal , " according to the statement from @entity8			2
the action by the regulatory agency is illegal because " if the government believes that @entity38 has committed an infraction , what follows is to open an administrative complaint against the channel , giving @entity38 the opportunity to defend itself , as the constitution mandates and guarantees , " @entity8 said			2
five other channels were also taken off the air , according to the @entity53			2
they were @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , and @entity59			0
the chamber 's president , @entity60 , said the organization 's position was to comply with the telecommunication rules that are in place in @entity1			2
@entity5 has accused @entity8 of violating broadcast laws and supporting a botched coup against him in 2002			1
before it lost its license in 2007 , it had been on the air for 53 years and was one of several private broadcast stations that openly criticized the government			0
relations between @entity5 's government and private broadcasters have been tense			0
last year , @entity5 closed 32 privately - owned radio stations and threatened to close more than 200 others for a variety of infractions , including working with expired permits and operation by unauthorized personnel			0
the @entity1 government says the closures are an effort to get all broadcasters to abide by regulations that are on the books , while station owners say the closures are politically motivated			0
the moves against the media have worried organizations that defend freedom of the press , as @entity5 has also expressed support for legislation that would mandate prison sentences for people who commit " media crimes			0
