-- belching smoke and fire , @entity2 's unmanned dragon spacecraft successfully blasted off from @entity5 , @entity6 , friday afternoon on a resupply mission to the @entity8			1
" i 'm feeling pretty excited			0
this is a happy day , " said @entity2 founder and ceo @entity10 on @entity13 's space blog after the craft roared into space atop a @entity17 rocket			1
@entity18 is scheduled to rendezvous with the @entity8 sunday morning			2
the station 's robotic arm will capture the space freighter , bringing it in for a berth at the @entity24 module port , @entity13 said			1
the space freighter is carrying 2.5 tons of cargo in its third resupply mission to the @entity8 , according to a @entity13 statement			1
the spacecraft 's payload includes some 150 experiments that range from growing plants efficiently in space to investigating how the human immune system functions in microgravity			2
@entity36 , @entity13 's associate administrator for @entity37 and @entity38 , said the planned experiments represent important research for the space program			2
the research " will help us improve our understanding of how humans adapt to living in space for long periods of time and help us develop technologies that will enable deep space exploration			0
" the cargo mission will also deliver a set of high - tech legs for @entity53			1
the legs will allow the robotic torso , which is already aboard the orbiting laboratory , better mobility to help with a variety of tasks aboard the space station			2
@entity2 is achieving some success with tests on reigniting the @entity17 rocket 's first stage on descent , @entity10 said on the @entity13 space blog			1
the hope is that by refiring the stage for a soft ocean landing , it can be recovered intact and reusable			0
also on friday , the @entity17 's second stage ejected five small satellites , called cubesats , which will serve a number of research functions			0
@entity18 will remain at the @entity8 for a month			0
when it leaves , it will bring back almost 3,500 pounds of scientific experiments , hardware , supplies and tools			0
it 's scheduled to splashdown in the @entity79 , west of @entity80 , @entity81 , on may 18 .			0

" this is a happy day , " said @entity2 founder and ceo @entity10
@entity10 reports early signs of success in tests to make rocket 's first stage reusable
the cargo mission will also deliver a set of high - tech legs for @entity53 .
@entity8 's robotic arm is scheduled to grab the space freighter sunday morning
