editor 's note : @entity2 is chairman of the @entity3			2
@entity2 says it 's becoming clear that the @entity6 administration is spending money recklessly			1
( @entity8 ) -- friday marks president @entity6 's 200th day in office , and in most respects , his second hundred days as president have been worse than the first 100			1
@entity6 campaigned on bringing " change " to @entity13 , and during his first 200 days as president , his real definition of change is becoming absolutely clear to @entity13			2
@entity6 and congressional democrats are determined to conduct their reckless and costly liberal experiments on the @entity13 people without any regard to the consequences			1
whether a $ 787 billion stimulus bill , a " cap - and - trade " scheme that is nothing more than a huge national energy tax on every @entity13 family and business , or a $ 1.6 trillion government - run health care plan , more and more @entity13 are rightfully concerned about @entity6 's change for this country			1
since @entity6 and @entity32 rushed through @entity33 a $ 787 billion stimulus package , unemployment in @entity13 has risen close to 9.5 percent , and every indication is that it will climb even higher when july 's unemployment report is released friday			2
in total , more than 2.6 million jobs have been lost since @entity6 took office			0
but what has the president 's stimulus bill brought us , if not the jobs he promised ? wasteful spending , such as $ 18 million to redesign @entity47 , the very government web site used to monitor stimulus spending , or $ 3.4 million for an " eco tunnel " in @entity51 designed to provide safe passage for turtles looking to cross the street			2
this is not the economic stimulus that the @entity13 people expected			0
the second of @entity6 's grand experiments on @entity13 was his massive so - called cap - and - trade bill that was rammed through the @entity60 this past june so fast that congressmen were n't given the chance to read it			1
this bill is nothing more than a national energy tax , plain and simple			2
its sole purpose is to increase the cost of energy so that @entity13 might use less			0
the @entity70 estimated that it would end up costing the average @entity13 family up to $ 1,870 per year and decrease the national gdp by $ 161 billion in the year 2020			2
the foundation also determined that during the 2012 - 2035 timeline , job losses would average more than 1.1 million			0
add in the fact that it would do almost nothing to prevent " climate change , " and all that is left is a national energy tax on environmentally friendly clothing			2
@entity6 's third and final experiment of his first 200 days as president -- and arguably his most dangerous -- is the fundamental transformation of our health care system			1
@entity6 is correct about one thing : our health care system needs reform			1
health care today costs too much for families and small businesses , preventing too many @entity13 from accessing the affordable quality care they need , when they need it			1
however , the president 's prescription to rein in these costs has little to do with real - world dollars and cents and everything to do with the complete government takeover and control of one - sixth of the @entity13 economy			1
the president claims that more government involvement in health care will promote competition			2
however , creating such a government - run entity would result in a massive government health care monopoly			1
private insurers would soon be put out of business , unable to compete with the subsidized government - run plan the president and liberals want			0
more than 88 million @entity13 could be forced out of their current private insurance plans and into the government - run plan , according to a study by the @entity116			0
@entity6 claims that if you like your current health care , you can keep it , but this is simply not true			1
then there is the issue of cost			0
despite what the president says , his government - run plan wo n't make health care more affordable			1
nothing ever becomes cheaper by being more expensive , and the @entity32 ' plan would cost at least $ 1.6 trillion , according to an analysis by @entity132			0
the @entity133 determined one of the @entity60 @entity32 ' plans would add more than $ 200 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years			0
the president is also planning to cut hundreds of billions of dollars from @entity138 and @entity139 to help pay for his government - run health care scheme			1
this is the epitome of robbing @entity143 to pay @entity144			0
the president and his @entity32 allies have looked to raise taxes on many small businesses to help pay for his government - run health care scheme , a foolish proposition even during the best of times , let alone during a recession			1
many small businesses would be hit with a penalty equal to 8 percent of their payroll for failing to provide insurance for their employees			0
punishing small - business owners with punitive tax legislation such as this will only increase the unemployment rate and extend the recession			0
@entity6 's first 200 days in office should be seen for exactly what they are : a clear indication of where he intends to direct @entity13 during his presidency			1
it is a direction that places less emphasis on individual entrepreneurs and private creativity and instead places power in the hands of a massive federal bureaucracy			0
it is a direction that rams massive spending bills through @entity33 in the name of economic stimulus and job creation , it is a direction that masks a costly job - killing national energy tax in environmentalism , and it is a direction that looks to put federal bureaucracy between patients and their doctors all in the guise of reducing costs and expanding coverage			1
@entity13 simply ca n't afford the president 's experiments			0
the president has done all this in just 200 days , and there are still more than 1,200 days left in his administration			0
that 's a frightening thought			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : the second hundred days have been worse than the first
he says @entity6 's programs call for massive spending on liberal priorities
cap - and - trade bill is a disguised energy tax on average @entity13 , he says
he says health care reform would be costly and lead to government control
