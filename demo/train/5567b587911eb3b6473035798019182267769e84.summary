-- never have so many been so outraged by so little			1
we live in a time of instant outrage			1
the explosion of social media and the demands of the 24 - hour news cycle let us immediately express our self - righteous anger about any incident , while the content - desperate media eagerly report -- and repackage -- our rage			1
outrage has become conveniently instantaneous			1
in the years before social media , people who were truly outraged would have to get a piece of paper , type a letter , put it in an envelope , stamp it and drop it in a mailbox			1
in contrast , today you can use your thumb to type a tweet on your phone and simply click " @entity26			2
" your rage is communicated to the world			0
just this week , we saw instant outrage on full display in response to @entity34 's jokes at sunday 's @entity35			1
amazingly , @entity36 offended almost every group in @entity38 in one show			0
he was accused of being sexist , anti-semitic , homophobic and racist			0
( it has to be an @entity35 record			0
) did @entity35 organizers possibly hire @entity36 to trigger our instant outrage for their own benefit ? after all , they knew he 'd say outrageous things			1
any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show , which has seen ratings woes in recent years , more relevant ? ( and ratings did rise for sunday 's @entity35 telecast 11 % in the coveted 18 - 49 age group			0
) make no mistake : our outrage has value			2
more recently , comedian @entity59 found herself the subject of outrage for a joke she made this week invoking the @entity63			1
the media are now filled with people debating the " important " question : did rivers go too far ? ( will the media ever stop asking that tired question about comedians ' jokes ? ! ) instant outrage , however , is not just reserved for comedians ; it crops up all over the news cycle			1
we saw it this week over @entity78 ceo @entity77 's new policy banning telecommuting in the company she 's been hired to revive , meaning people have to work from the office every day or quit			0
@entity26 lit up : it 's outrageous ! it even happened to me last weekend when i was on @entity0 with anchor @entity86 and playfully joked about @entity87			2
bingo ! my @entity26 feed was instantly filled with @entity87 incensed that i had the audacity to poke fun at their beloved country			0
just to be clear , i have nothing against @entity87			0
in fact , it 's my third favorite country in @entity38			0
there 's so much more : @entity99 's halftime @entity100 outfit ; @entity101 tweeting a photo of his daughter 's legs ; @entity105 tweeting a photo of her diamond - encrusted gun ; @entity109 star @entity108 wearing a t - shirt that some claim was about devil worship and / or a symbol for the illuminati			0
we all want to have our opinions heard			0
when we are mad about something , we want others to know about it			2
when we are offended , we want to call out the person who has offended us			0
but here 's the thing : why not also unleash our collective fury over issues more meaningful than just a comedian 's joke or a celebrity 's tweet ? i 'm not suggesting we ignore those -- because even if i did , no one would listen			1
but in addition to those , take a moment to express your powerful outrage over issues that might tangibly benefit your life and the lives of others			2
let 's get collectively angry that every nine seconds , a woman in the @entity143 is assaulted or beaten			0
and let 's get even angrier that three women a day in the @entity143 are killed by domestic violence attacks			0
let 's get really pissed that 22 % of @entity143 children are living in poverty			2
and please save some ( actually a lot ) of outrage for @entity152 , which has become the political equivalent of @entity154 : we only see it in media coverage doing bad things			1
sure , go ahead and be outraged over @entity59 ' and @entity34 's jokes if you must , but let 's show some anger about the fact that almost 10,000 @entity143 died in gun violence last year and still @entity152 has n't passed a universal background check to ensure that criminals and mentally ill people ca n't legally buy guns			1
so let 's collectively tweet away about the issues that outrage us , be they stupid comments or @entity177 , comedians ' jokes or the growing income inequality in @entity38			1
but please do n't just reserve all your outrage for celebrities			2
they simply are n't worthy of it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : we live in a *cultural* era of instant outrage , fed by social media , news cycle
he says we *inflate* small things into big deals too easily -- jokes by @entity59 , @entity34
he says we all get mad but why not about really outrageous things such as poverty , abuse
@entity185 : next time you tweet about a celebrity outrage , direct some ire at something real , too
