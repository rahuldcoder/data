" this is the house ? " my mom asks , turning around			0
" yes , " says our guide			0
" this is where your grandmother was born			0
" my mother and i have traveled more than 6,000 miles to explore @entity9 , a tiny village outside @entity10 , @entity11 , founded in the fifth century			0
we 're here to learn more about our heritage and get a sense of where her family is from			1
we 're not the first ones to visit for that reason			0
even though @entity9 has a population of just 1,200 , our guide says plenty of other travelers have come searching for records , data , photos and that intangible sense of history you ca n't get without visiting a place yourself			1
interest in genealogy appears to be at an all - time high , with a recent @entity30 indicating that four in five @entity31 wish to learn more about their family history			1
shows like @entity35 's upcoming " roots : our journeys home , " along with series " @entity40 " and " @entity41 " are gaining in popularity			0
" people see these programs and they want that experience for themselves , " says @entity42 , family historian at @entity43			1
as a result , she says , more travelers are looking to incorporate family history research into a trip or even plan a standalone journey for the sole purpose of discovering their roots			1
want to embark on your own family tree trip ? here are some tips and techniques to help smooth the process			1
get your history organized before you leave if you 're spending the time and money to get to a far - flung destination , you do n't want to spend your visit stuck in a library or office			1
it 's more rewarding to get your history organized before you leave			1
" start with what you know and build your tree online , " says @entity42			0
sites like @entity43 , @entity72 and @entity43 can get you on the right track , while genealogy research site @entity74 has a comprehensive collection of useful links			1
for example , @entity43 has 14 billion searchable , indexed records -- everything from passenger records to census data and more			1
" remember , online records can build the branches , but there will be holes -- things you ca n't find because of records loss or privacy details , " @entity42 adds			1
beyond just building out a family tree skeleton online , it 's also wise to create a historical timeline before your trip			2
a snapshot of the family 's movements will help you see holes easier			2
for example , start with one family member -- say a grandparent -- and create a timeline of where and when they were born , where they lived , went to school , were married , and so forth			2
writing things down in a narrative fashion can help you pinpoint gaps , like when a child might have been born or a family member emigrated			2
let them know you 're coming regardless if where in the world family history travel takes you , it helps to get in touch with a few locals before you arrive			1
people worth contacting include librarians , city clerks , museum officers and clergy			1
giving information in advance helps a researcher flag potential documents and can maximize time on the ground while visiting			2
prior to our @entity11 trip , my mother and i got in touch with the innkeeper at the one hotel in the village to inquire about an @entity11 - speaking guide to help us			0
our host went above and beyond -- as it turns out his family had lived in the village for generations and knew all the people we needed to speak to			2
because we sent information requests with family names and dates in advance , by the time we arrived he had already laid the groundwork and we had appointments with the priest and the city clerk 's office			1
that allowed us to spend a good chunk of our time wandering the streets , taking in the ambiance and imagining how my great - grandmother 's family lived			2
on - site research : tombstones and immigration offices sure , you may have to spend time browsing through old boxes and files searching for documents , but there are countless of other places to find data while visiting a location			2
" visiting the place is where you do the finishing touches , " says @entity42			0
cemeteries : local cemeteries often provide location - based details you wo n't find in other files such as place of death			0
they can also turn up details on previously unknown family members or even children that died as infants and were never recorded			1
@entity189 offers a great tip for getting details off a worn headstone : shine a flashlight directly above the headstone to cast a shadow on engravings -- you can then take a picture of the shadow			0
it 's far more effective than using the paper - rubbing - with - charcoal technique you see so often in the movies -- that can actually permanently damage the headstone			0
immigration offices : passport applications and naturalization records can be information goldmines , as they often include detailed information on family records , places of residence and work			1
military / va offices : military pension records also are crammed with data including dates and location of service , awards and recognition and time spent overseas			2
note that these might be harder to access and there are privacy issues concerning release of some statistics , but worth investigating			0
by the end of our journey we discovered new details previously blank on the family tree			0
more importantly , we felt connected to a place that was previously just a spot on the map			0
as @entity234 , author of " roots , " so eloquently put it : " in all of us there is a hunger , marrow - deep , to know our heritage -- to know who we are and where we have come from			0
without this enriching knowledge , there is a hollow yearning			0

interest in genealogy is *rising* , with many choosing to *combine* travel with family history research
websites like @entity43 offer access to billions of indexed records
librarians , city clerks , museum officers and clergy members can be solid sources of information
