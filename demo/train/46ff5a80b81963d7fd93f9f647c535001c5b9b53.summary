@entity0 , @entity1 -- a day after a @entity0 , @entity1 , teen allegedly rampaged through his high school 's hallways , stabbing wildly with two kitchen knives , the first hints of a possible motive began to emerge			1
the attorney for 16 - year - old @entity10 raised the specter that his client may have been bullied , telling @entity2 affiliate @entity13 in @entity14 on thursday that it looks like some kind of " bullying event " may have played a role			1
" i think a lot of things have happened			2
i do n't want to comment specifically , but i think there are some things that occurred that led to where we are today , " @entity21 said			2
but an @entity28 official , familiar with the investigation , discounted bullying as a motive			1
" he was disaffected but not bullied , " the official said on condition of anonymity			1
@entity10 , a sophomore , was charged as an adult and faces four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault in connection with wednesday 's attack at @entity42 that left 20 teens and one adult wounded			1
some classmates at the school describe @entity10 as having few friends and being quiet but also as a " really nice kid , " a description that contradicts the image of a knife - wielding teen offered by authorities			1
@entity0 police chief @entity53 said investigators have n't yet made sense of the mass stabbing			1
" we believe , through the investigation , that this was random , " he told @entity2 's " @entity60			1
" " we do n't have anybody that was targeted , as far as we know at this point			2
" still , there were more questions than answers about what led the teen to allegedly attack his classmates with two steak knives believed to have been taken from his family 's home			1
" we 're going to try to figure out what happened here			2
obviously , there 's a problem			1
you just do n't leave and go to school , and do what he did yesterday , " @entity21 told @entity2 earlier in the day			0
there is " some deep - rooted problem somewhere that caused him to do this			0
" one thread that police are looking into is the possibility that there was a phone threat the night before , @entity53 said			1
but no immediate evidence has been found to confirm such a call , and @entity21 discounted the allegation			0
" he was home all night the night before this occurred , with his parents , " he told @entity13			1
" they did not see him on the phone arguing with anybody			1
" the @entity28 has seized electronics belonging to @entity10 , including a computer and cell phone , and will analyze them for any clues , the police chief said			1
in a telephone call thursday , president @entity105 assured @entity107 principal @entity107 that the @entity28 will continue to assist in the investigation , the @entity104 said			1
' all kind of a blur ' questions are also being raised by residents of @entity0 , a quiet middle - class enclave with a population of 20,000 east of @entity14			1
how did this happen , and why ? " we are so small compared to other communities , " said @entity116 , who left @entity14 to move to @entity0 almost 20 years ago			0
" i came out here purposely to raise my children in a school district that we felt was safe as well as academically sound			0
" the mother of one of the teens wounded in the attack said everyone must ask themselves what alienated the suspect so much that he allegedly stabbed and slashed nearly two dozen people			2
" ... we need to look and say , how are our children coping with social skills these days ? how are they with other children ? how are they being tested in the world for negative or positive ways ? " said @entity133			0
her son , @entity137 , was in the school hallway when he saw a " kid " run by and hit him in the back			0
a friend who was with him started screaming			0
" i did n't really know what was going on at the time , " @entity133 told reporters			0
" it was all kind of a blur			2
" as the attacker continued to charge down the crowded hallway , @entity133 began to wonder if he was going to survive or die			0
speaking from the hospital , @entity133 said he suffered a stab wound in the back and a bruised lung			0
he expected to be released as early as thursday			0
he reflected on whether @entity10 would have chosen the path he allegedly did if he had had more friends or a better support group			1
" i feel he has some issues he has to work out , " @entity133 said			0
another student at the school who witnessed the attack said the attacker did n't utter a word			0
" he was very quiet			0
he just was kind of doing it , " @entity167 said			2
" and he had this , like , look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around , just stabbing whoever was in his way			0
" the attack ended when the assistant principal , @entity175 , tackled the teen , authorities said			2
the accused attacker , @entity10 , lived on the same street as @entity175 , just two houses down			1
heroes in all forms step up during school stabbing ' not a dysfunctional family ' @entity10 could n't seem more normal , the way his lawyer describes him			1
" this is not a dysfunctional family , " @entity21 , told @entity2 on thursday			0
" they 're like the @entity188			0
these parents are active with their two sons , and we 're trying to figure out what happened			0
" the young man also did not seem to embody the cliche of digitally connected youth			0
according to @entity196 , the county deputy emergency management coordinator , @entity10 had a very minor @entity198 presence and did n't have much experience on @entity200			1
@entity21 said he would file a motion to move the case to juvenile court			0
@entity205 district attorney @entity204 has argued against bail , saying that there could be no conditions that would protect the community and that @entity10 made " statements when subdued by officials that he wanted to die			1
" @entity10 is being held without bail at the @entity205 juvenile detention center			1
he was treated for injuries to his hands , police said			2
the students who were hurt range in age from 14 to 17 , emergency coordinator @entity196 said			0
the injuries were stabbing - related , such as lacerations or punctures			0
@entity2 's @entity222 and @entity223 reported from @entity0 , and @entity224 reported and wrote the story in @entity226			2
@entity2 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			2
