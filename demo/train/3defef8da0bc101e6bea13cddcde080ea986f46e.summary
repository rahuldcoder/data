a recent @entity1 report of misconduct by a banking regulator is giving watchdogs some ammunition to argue that financial regulators are too cozy with the banks they are tasked with overseeing			1
the report , part of a small batch just released by the department 's inspector - general , says that a government employee in @entity15 who served as a bank examiner accepted " gratuities ( golf fees and / or food ) on at least four occasions " from a bank he was reviewing			1
the report , conducted in 2010 , called the situation a " conflict of interest " for the employee , who worked at the @entity28			2
" you have a government employee , during a time when he has a special responsibility to oversee this bank , actually taking time from work and going to play golf with these folks , " said @entity29 , a researcher with the @entity30			2
" it was a pretty striking example of a government employee actually cozying up to the folks he 's supposed to be regulating			0
" but inspector - general @entity42 , who polices the @entity1 and released the files , defended the agency			1
" these investigative reports are good examples of the fact that the department has been successful in demonstrating that there is little toleration for individual misconduct			1
" " my opinion is that @entity1 has an institutional highly ethical culture , " he added			1
but @entity29 is still critical			0
" when folks wonder why regulators did n't do a better job of stopping the financial crisis , or they 're wondering why @entity28 did n't spot the huge trading loss at @entity60 earlier this year , i think part of the issue is just that the examiners were just too close to the folks they were supposed to be examining , " he said			0
@entity29 wrote about the case last week , after the @entity1 inspector - general 's report was posted online by the disclosure organization @entity68			1
the website obtained it through a @entity72 request			0
five other reports from the last few years , in which allegations of misconduct were substantiated , were also made public			1
in one case , an employee was found to have used his work computer to solicit prostitutes via the online classified site @entity81 and arrange trysts on three occasions			0
in another , an employee was found to have emailed internal information about @entity1 contracting to her husband , who worked for a contractor			1
the rest involved disorderly conduct at a stadium ; running up a $ 240 @entity93 bill on the government 's dime ; and banking with a bank that was also regulated by the agency			0
the @entity28 responded that it attaches great importance to ethical conduct , and any alleged misconduct is investigated			0
" these are isolated incidences , and do not diminish the highly ethical behavior of thousands of other @entity28 employees , " the agency said in a written statement			0
and @entity107 , the @entity1 's deputy general counsel , said there is " absolutely no evidence of any pattern or trend			1
" " unfortunately , in all institutions of every size , there are some employees who act inappropriately , " @entity107 said			0
" although any misconduct is unacceptable , this is a small number that does not fairly reflect a @entity1 with tens of thousands of employees			1
" while employees are disciplined for any misconduct , the overwhelming majority of them " serve the @entity122 people with professionalism , diligence , and integrity , " he added			2
the disciplinary outcomes for the six employees were not listed -- except for the prostitution case , where the employee retired			0
@entity1 officials referred five of the six cases to criminal prosecutors , although charges were not ultimately filed			2
" they did refer them out for prosecution , and i ca n't see taking more aggressive action than that , " said @entity137 of @entity138 in @entity139			0
" no question that it 's all embarrassing , and that it 's all unacceptable ; but i think @entity1 can also be credited for taking it on , doing something about it , not trying to sweep any of this under the rug			2
