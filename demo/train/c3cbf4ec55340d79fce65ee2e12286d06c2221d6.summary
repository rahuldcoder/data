-- for the past year , @entity1 has been living a double life of sorts : administrative assistant by day , secret agent of kindness by night			1
the 32 - year - old @entity8 employee only recently revealed herself as the woman behind " secret agent l , " a giver of random acts of kindness that has been brightening the days of unsuspecting @entity14 , @entity15 , residents since july 2009			1
the project began , @entity1 says , with the birthday of one of her blog readers who had become a close friend			1
but instead of asking for the latest book on the best - seller list or an @entity26 gift card , the friend suggested @entity1 perform an act of kindness in her name			1
so with a single , lavender hydrangea bloom tucked under the windshield wipers of a random vehicle , @entity30 was born			2
@entity1 used her friend 's birthday idea to launch a new blog documenting subsequent secret missions , posting photos of the gifts -- all inexpensive to fit within her administrative assistant salary -- that have included $ 5 @entity43 gift cards , a roll of quarters at a laundromat and decorative cards emblazoned with uplifting quotes			1
the gifts are all tagged with a business card printed in " secret agent - y " type , she laughs			2
her tagline : " @entity54			0
" the blog -- with the help of @entity57 -- took off , and @entity1 now has about 80 " @entity58 " across the @entity59 and abroad who are implementing the idea in their cities			1
her favorite mission came on @entity64 when she took blank notecards and wrote inspirational messages about how the holiday " is n't just about romantic love			0
" " i wanted people to know that today 's the day you can celebrate love for your own family , your own friends and your own life , " she says			0
" i left them all over the city , and i just thought it felt so good			0
" she tries to do at least one mission a week , but notes " if i had the money , i would do it every single day , " calling the project " one of the greatest honors of my life			2
" @entity1 says she decided to reveal her double life at a coming - out party last month to help advance her charitable efforts			1
the party was a fundraiser for the @entity89 , an organization " near and dear " to @entity1 , she told @entity91 's " @entity90 " on wednesday			2
more than $ 1,500 was raised , she said			0
" i think people are so hungry to not feel alone and not feel weird and that they do n't matter , " she says			0
" i think people really want to feel valued and noticed because there 's so much hurt out there and my project is an attempt to heal some of that			2
" she hopes her anonymous gifts will help at least bring smiles to those going through a tough time -- though she never sticks around to see who finds them			1
" i think that 's part of the fun -- it 's just sort of putting the gift there and leaving , and just knowing that somebody 's going to get it and it does n't matter who , " she says			0
she often receives e-mails afterwards from gift recipients to her secret agent account			0
" one of the sort of themes that i 've noticed in these e-mails is that they all seem to find things on days when they 're having a really bad day , " she says			0
