@entity0 -- @entity2 , who was born in @entity3 and came to @entity4 at the age of 5 , described her predicament in a @entity8 hearing tuesday			0
" despite my compliance with the law , there 's no way i can achieve citizenship , " said @entity2 , now 18 and ready to start college in the fall at the @entity11			2
" despite aspirations and hard work , i face deportation in one year			1
" in short , she said , " i am a @entity20 student			2
" @entity2 referred to legislation pushed by @entity22 but opposed by republicans that would give children of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship through military service or college education			1
the measure passed the @entity32 last year but stalled in the @entity8 due to a @entity23 filibuster			1
with @entity23 now holding a @entity32 majority , the proposal has no chance of passing in this @entity37			1
@entity22 backers , stung by a failure to deliver any significant immigration reform since president @entity41 took office in 2009 , called the hearing to try to raise the public profile of the issue in the earliest stages of the 2012 election campaign			0
" i ask my colleagues to consider the plight of these young people , who find themselves in a legal twilight zone , through no fault of their own , " said sen. @entity48 , @entity49 , a leading proponent of the @entity20			2
" they are willing to serve the country they love			0
all they ask for is a chance			0
" another @entity63 on the panel , sen. @entity60 of @entity61 , cited a university study that estimated students who would come under the @entity20 's provisions could contribute as much as $ 1.4 trillion to the @entity4 economy over a 40 - year period			2
" that 's pretty compelling evidence that these students work hard , that they care , and that they want to be part of the @entity72 , " @entity60 said , " and to the best of my knowledge the @entity4 dream has never been an exclusive dream that only some people can share			0
" @entity23 sen. @entity77 of @entity78 called for comprehensive immigration reforms that include stronger border security , rather than focusing on one aspect of the issue through the @entity20			1
" this bill , sadly , does nothing to fix our broken immigration system , " @entity77 said			0
" it may be worse that we 're providing incentive for future illegal immigration			1
this bill does nothing for border security , workplace enforcement , visa overstays , which account for about 40 % of illegal immigration in this country			1
in other words it does nothing to reduce the likelihood of future illegal immigration			1
" @entity77 described himself as a supporter of the goals of the @entity20 and immigration reform , a claim disputed by senate majority leader @entity104 , @entity105			1
" he 's voted against comprehensive immigration reform every time " the issue has come up in recent years , @entity104 told reporters			0
the @entity20 would offer legal standing to immigrants who entered the @entity4 illegally as children under the age of 16 and had lived in the country for at least five years			1
the bill would require , among other things , a high school or general educational development diploma , two years of college or military service , and criminal background checks			2
advocates say the bill would give legal standing to young people brought to the @entity4 by their parents who have bettered themselves and served their new country			0
@entity23 opponents equate the measure to amnesty , and have said it would signal to the world that the @entity4 is not serious about enforcing its laws or its borders			1
they have also called the bill unfair to immigrants who , in many cases , waited years to come to the country legally			0
regardless of the fate of the @entity20 , the immigration issue remains politically potent			1
@entity41 won several @entity141 states in 2008 -- including @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144 -- partly on the rising power of the @entity147 vote			0
@entity22 believe @entity147 voters might put traditionally @entity23 @entity149 in play next year			2
in the long run , @entity22 are also hoping to use their advantage among @entity147 to make inroads in core @entity23 states such as @entity78			0
@entity41 won more than two - thirds of the nationwide @entity147 vote in 2008			0
his approval rating among @entity147 hovered around 68 % during the first three months of this year , according to the most recent @entity159 polls			0
for their part , @entity23 have depended on the immigration issue in the past to fire up conservative voters			1
some analysts also believe that if @entity22 push too hard and too fast on immigration , particularly in tough economic times , it could push swing voters toward the @entity23			2
@entity1 's @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
