he 's a two - time olympic gold medalist , successful businessman and has a killer nickname that attests to his daredevil nature on the slopes			2
but what @entity6 ' the @entity5 most wants is a repeat of his triple gold - medal - winning performance at the 2013 @entity10			1
the @entity12 star took top prize in the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity17 events in @entity18 , @entity19 , two years ago -- the first time any skier had achieved such a feat since the legendary @entity23 did so in 1968			1
now the 30 - year - old has his sights firmly set on doing it all again as he prepares to make his first appearance at the 2015 @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30			1
" it would be awesome to repeat that , " @entity5 recently told @entity0 's @entity31			1
" there 's a reason it has n't been done in 45 years			2
it 's because it 's so hard , because so many different guys are specializing in different disciplines			2
" " to be able to do that in three very different disciplines is a tremendous feat and definitely the biggest achievement of my career			2
" in the period since he became " @entity47 of @entity18 , " @entity5 has gone on to secure @entity49 gold in @entity50 ( to add to the @entity15 gold he won in @entity52 2006 ) and the fifth @entity54 crystal globe of his career in 2014 for the same discipline			1
yet he 's far from had it all his own way			2
" @entity61 " finished way back in 12th and 14th position in the @entity15 and @entity17 events in @entity50 respectively			0
and he currently lies in 12th position in this year 's overall @entity54 standings , way off the impressive pace set by @entity19 's @entity65			0
@entity65 has won the overall title for the past three years and is heavily fancied in the giant slalom at @entity29			1
other challengers include the in - form @entity69 of @entity71 who has won three downhill events this season and picked up @entity17 gold in @entity50 last year			0
the likes of @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 will also fancy their chances of tearing up @entity5 's dream script			1
but @entity5 feels the intricacies of the @entity83 course could help play into his hands			1
" ( the course ) is really great in every discipline and downhill it 's probably the most fun course around , " he said , adding that " the @entity17 hill is really good for me ... in giant slalom i 've had a tonne of success there over the last five years			2
" having the backing of an enthusiastic home crowd will also doubtless help			0
" i 've always liked racing in the @entity12 , " he said			1
" i think it 's kind of an understated disadvantage for @entity98 in general having to race @entity99 which are generally in @entity100			0
" " so it 's nice to be able to take those euros out of their element and make them live out of their duffel bags for a couple of weeks and experience the travel side of things			0
" with the likes of @entity111 and @entity112 on form and @entity114 back after a lengthy injury layoff , hopes are high for the @entity12 contingent			1
some have even suggested this could be the strongest @entity12 side ever going into a @entity120			1
" we 've got an amazing team right now , " @entity5 said			1
" i think we have a really good chance to get some medals on the downhill side of things and on @entity17 ... ( there 's ) myself and @entity127			0
" on the women 's side you have @entity114 ( @entity131 ) who 's already dominating again which is pretty incredible			0
@entity134 ( @entity133 ) , who 's found her stride again in the middle of this year , is dominating ... and winning @entity14 as well			0
" so i think we have a lot of different athletes on both the men 's and the women 's side that could win a lot of medals			0
" @entity5 reserves particular praise for @entity131 who broke the record for all - time career wins with her 62nd @entity54 triumph late last month			1
" i think most of us are so taken aback by how fast she came back from having a two - year break , " he said			0
" being able to dominate so quickly , i think that 's the biggest thing we 're surprised about			0
" i think none of us are surprised that she 's won ( now 64 ) @entity99 or something because that was kind of an inevitability i think in a lot of our minds			0
( but ) that 's cool that she 's able to achieve that for sure			0
" away from the slopes @entity5 has been kept busy building his own shred brand of ski clothing and equipment in recent years			1
he describes it as a fusion of the best technical and most stylish gear on the market			2
so successful has the venture been that some of his biggest rivals on the slopes , like @entity177 and @entity178 , have even been spotted using shred goggles			2
but the stresses of the business world will be way to the back of @entity5 's mind when race time arrives over the coming weeks			1
of more concern will be winning and making the most of the unique set up of the @entity120 event			1
" i think the @entity28 is awesome because there 's so few races we 're racing men and women together so it 's kind of cool to be able to feed off that energy			0
" normally we 'll have a giant slalom and a slalom one place and then you have to ... get in your car and drive a couple of hours and then you go do a downhill and a @entity17 the next weekend			0
" it 's nice to be able to do everything all in one place			0
the @entity28 , like you said , it 's second @entity206			0
it 's really cool to have those races that really mean a lot and then to be able to do it in the @entity12 is a huge opportunity for us			1
