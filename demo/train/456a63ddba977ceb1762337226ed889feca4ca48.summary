a flesh - eating drug that turns people into zombie - like creatures seems to have made its way to the @entity6			1
this extremely addictive injectable opioid is called krokodil ( pronounced like crocodile ) or desomorphine			1
it 's so named in part because users report black or green scaly skin as a side effect			1

" it 's a zombie drug -- it literally kills you from the inside out , " @entity26 said			1
" if you want way to die , this is a way to die			0
" opinion : drug prohibition is a global folly @entity43 causes serious damage to the veins and soft tissue infections , rapidly followed by gangrene and necrosis , according to a 2013 study ( @entity50 )			1
the soft tissue damage happens around the injection site			0
the drug also seems to clump in the veins as it fails to dissolve completely in the blood			1
the clumps make their way to distant places in the body and start to damage tissue , said dr. @entity60 , medical director of the @entity61			0
@entity60 said he hopes the drug " does n't show its ugly face " in @entity65 but said doctors across the country are aware of the drug			1
so far there are no officially confirmed @entity6 cases of krokodil abuse			1
to have official confirmation , the @entity72 would need to have a sample of the drug that caused the problem			1
a @entity72 fact sheet about the drug released this month said the @entity79 , the @entity72 database that collects scientifically verified data on drug items and cases , identified two exhibits submitted to these labs as desomorphine in 2004 but none since then			1
" it 's not clear how widely used it is in the @entity6 , " @entity60 said			0
@entity90 fights drug overdoses with new labels for prescription @entity95 affiliate @entity94 in @entity96 spoke with a woman who said her best friend from @entity99 , @entity25 , died after using krokodil last year			1
" the doctors say it ate him from the inside out , " @entity101 told the tv station			0
" it was n't until the next day that they told us that it was krokodil			0
" but @entity110 , a spokesman for the @entity111 , said krokodil was ruled out in the @entity99 case through an autopsy			0
" we watched the reports carefully to see if it was here , " he said			0
" it was just a drug overdose , and nothing in the system consistent with krokodil			2
" there have been many confirmed cases of krokodil abuse in @entity126 and @entity127			1
an estimated 100,000 in @entity126 and around 20,000 people in @entity127 are estimated to have injected the drug in 2011 , according to a study that ran in the @entity131 this year			2
experts theorize the drug first spread across @entity126 and @entity127 when heroin became less available			2
@entity43 is cheaper than heroin and can be easily cooked up in someone 's home much like meth			1
people making krokodil combine the painkiller codeine with easily available chemicals			0
they can use iodine ; strong alkalies such as mr. @entity144 , a kitchen and bathroom cleaner ; hydrochloric acid ; red phosphorous from matches ; and / or organic solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner , according to the study			0
mortality rates are high among users , according to the study			2
regular marijuana use on the rise in @entity126 , users frequently are young people with relatively short drug histories , the study found			1

" this may be an inexpensive high compared to other drugs , according to its reputation , ( but it ) is more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms and be a real problem for users , " @entity60 said			2
" my advice is to would - be users , ' do n't			1
' this is a risky way to try and get high			0
" the short half - life of the drug means a user 's attention is narrowed to the " process of acquiring and preparing and administering the drug , leaving little time for matters other than avoiding withdrawal and chasing ( the ) high , " according to one medical study , hence its reputation for creating " zombies			1
" binges on the drug reportedly last over several days			2
during the binge , a user can show irrational behavior and experience sleep deprivation and exhaustion , memory loss and speech problems			0
according to the @entity19 hospital , the five people brought in who may have used krokodil said they thought they were buying heroin			0
" i think it 's the tip of the iceberg ; i think it 's going to get a lot worse before it gets better , " said @entity26 , the addiction specialist			0
" i think if it stays on the market long enough , you 're going to have people who are desperate addicts that ca n't support their heroin habit but can utilize this drug , not really caring about the consequences , and get the same high for a third of the price			2
" there 's something ( potentially dangerous ) about molly			0
