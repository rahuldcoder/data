-- the @entity1 is changing how folks read stuff online -- no surprise if you think how different a gizmo it is to a pc			2
but a new study shows it 's moving online reading into primetime tv hours , which is big news			0
is evening reading coming back , just in a digital style ? the study comes from internal data acquired by @entity16 , a web service that lets users bookmark web content for perusal at a different time			2
though you may think this slightly colors the dataset , the way this service works gives the company unique access to time - coded data on how @entity1 users ( and traditional computer users ) read content online			1
by looking at how traffic moves through their servers , normalized for global time differences , the @entity16 team worked out how traditional pc users spread their online reading out during the day			0
as you may expect , given how deeply into our everyday lives the computer has penetrated , the curve of content consumption is pretty stable -- not much happens in the wee small hours of the day , then as people wake and go to work there 's more traffic , with a small peak spread out around traditional lunch hours and another around 8 p.m. after the evening meal			1
when you look at @entity54 and @entity1 user traffic , distinct from " normal " pcs , everything is suddenly very different			0
@entity54 users have distinct peaks in their reading habits , timed to correspond with the morning routine of breakfast , then a commute to work , the end of the work day and homeward journey , and then last thing in the evening			0
this matches the @entity54 's status as a handy , portable , always - on net browser that 's good for quick content consumption			1
but it 's with the @entity1 that the statistics get very odd indeed : with minor usage spikes first thing in the morning , at lunchtime and then dinner time , the main bulk of @entity1 text content consumption is from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.			1
@entity0 : ipad 2 rumor round - up this is prime - time tv 's slot , and it seems that as well as settling back on the sofa to watch tv , people are taking their @entity1 with them too			2
the data does n't reveal if folk are multitasking ( spending some time ogling their favorite shows , some looking data up on the @entity91 ) or are ignoring the tv altogether -- but the data will still be of concern to tv execs who expect uninterrupted attention from tv watchers , in order to maximize ad revenues			1
plus it 's something of a return to a traditional leisure hour image : people settling down on the couch after the evening meal to read the paper or a book , possibly to listen to the radio at the same time			1
remembering a study last year that showed how much time users devote to reading magazines on an @entity1 , we have to wonder is the @entity1 causing a renaissance in reading -- just digitally , and with web content as well as digital books content ? @entity0 : more technology coverage if this is true , then @entity120 's @entity119 newspaper is arriving with pinpoint timing			2
and the hordes of @entity124 tablets that have just arrived should accentuate the effect			0
this is thus something that @entity127 and advertising executives need to pay careful attention to , because the attention focus of the average consumer may be switching away from the tv to their other ( newer ) powerful glowing screen -- in their laps			0
