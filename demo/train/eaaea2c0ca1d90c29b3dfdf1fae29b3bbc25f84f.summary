-- @entity1 becomes a greater emergency with each passing day			1
this week defense minister @entity3 and other members of president @entity6 's inner circle were murdered ; opposition groups claimed responsibility			0
last week @entity9 , @entity1 's ambassador to @entity10 , resigned from the government and joined the opposition , and the government 's militiamen apparently shot villagers in @entity16 at close range			2
there is growing consensus across the @entity22 political spectrum that @entity6 must go , that opposition forces must be armed in order to contend for political power , and that the situation in @entity1 is a strategic issue for the @entity22 and its allies			1
on the @entity30 floor earlier this year , sen. @entity28 spoke for many analysts when he discussed the strategic significance of @entity1 : " the end of the @entity6 regime would sever @entity36 's lifeline to @entity37 , eliminate a long - standing threat to @entity39 , bolster @entity41 's sovereignty and independence , and inflict a strategic defeat on the @entity37 regime			1
it would be a geopolitical success of the first order			0
" the humanitarian dimension of @entity1 's crisis is underscored by reports claiming that anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 people have been killed there in the past 17 months of violence			2
falling prey to election - year politicking , president @entity56 , gov. @entity57 , and their campaign surrogates eschew frank discussion of @entity1 and its implications -- to answer hard questions about sacrificing life and spending treasure abroad in yet another @entity66 battlefield is to open up political risks that can not be calculated			1
that 's why it is worth recalling events of the early 1980s and former secretary of defense @entity72 's national security doctrine			1
on june 6 , 1982 , @entity39 , seeking to relieve pressure on its northern borders by dismantling the @entity76 's base of operation , invaded @entity41 , a country beset by civil war and @entity1 occupation			1
soon thereafter , @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity22 formed a multinational force to help stabilize the country -- as differing factions of @entity84 and @entity85 as well as the @entity39 and @entity1 were in a tangled web of conflict -- and allow @entity76 fighters to leave the country			1
the @entity76 withdrawal was completed by august 30 , and the @entity90 departed on september 10 , but the story did not end there			0
the @entity90 failed to stabilize @entity41			2
president - elect @entity93 was killed in his @entity95 party headquarters on september 14			0
in the days that followed , @entity39 forces stood by as @entity41 phalangists massacred @entity99 in the @entity101 refugee camps , an act of retribution for the assassination of @entity93 , which may , in fact , have been undertaken by @entity107 forces			2
a few days later , @entity93 's brother @entity108 was elected president , and the @entity110 re-entered @entity111			0
on october 23 , 1983 , a suicide bomber drove a truck into the @entity115 barracks at the @entity111 airport , and @entity80 's barracks also were struck by a suicide bomb -- 241 @entity22 servicemen and nearly 60 @entity80 soldiers were killed			2
it was the single bloodiest day for the @entity115 since the battle of @entity123 in 1945			0
between december 1983 and february 1984 , @entity22 battleships retaliated against combatants who had targeted the @entity90			2
the @entity126 undertook a relentless counterattack against @entity1 and @entity129 forces , shooting its 16 - inch guns for the first time since the @entity132			2
by april , the entire @entity90 , which the @entity133 had joined , had left @entity41			0
the civil war continued until 1990			0
president @entity135 supported secretary of state @entity137 's arguments in favor of @entity22 diplomacy and peacekeeping in @entity41			1
but in @entity72 's view , @entity41 was the wrong fight for the @entity22			1
in a speech on november 28 , 1984 , he articulated his six principles for future @entity22 military engagements : ( 1 ) there should be no commitment of @entity22 forces abroad unless there is a clear and vital interest for the @entity22 or its allies ; ( 2 ) combat , if agreed upon , should be undertaken with the intention of military victory , using whatever forces and resources are needed to achieve that goal ; ( 3 ) political and military objectives must be clearly defined before entering a conflict ; ( 4 ) the relationship between military means and diplomatic , military , and political objectives " must be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary , " not just established at the beginning of the military engagement ; ( 5 ) no battle is worth fighting or will be successful without " reasonable assurance we will have the support of the @entity22 people " and @entity163 ; and ( 6 ) the commitment of @entity22 troops to a conflict should be an act of last resort			1
the @entity135 administration had approved @entity39 's invasion of @entity41 , and although initially welcomed by many @entity179 in @entity41 the @entity22 came to be seen as too @entity180 , pro-christian , and @entity181			1
@entity22 forces ' unintentional shelling of civilians did not help matters			0
furthermore , the re-entry of the @entity110 was not accompanied by a serious understanding of strategy , objectives and the relationship between them			0
so president @entity135 decided to withdraw @entity22 forces from what would likely become a major military quagmire for the @entity22 , instead of a multinational peacekeeping operation			0
that caution brings us back to @entity1 , where the crisis is beginning to meet @entity72 's criteria on objectives : get @entity6 to leave			1
but means and strategies are very much in flux			0
the call for a @entity22 - led international coalition of the willing to help the @entity1 opposition is one suggested military and diplomatic strategy , but how realistic is it in the near term , or pre-election day ? @entity72 's principles remind us that the situation in @entity1 is difficult for the @entity22 because calibrating means and ends in the maelstrom is easier said than done			1
perhaps the humanitarian crisis that @entity1 has become will help settle the matter			0
but , as @entity72 declared , the @entity22 should " not assign a combat mission to a force configured for peacekeeping			1
" translation : @entity41 must not happen again			0
join us on @entity222 / @entity221 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			0

@entity1 becomes a greater emergency with each passing day , says @entity228
but @entity22 must think twice before entering yet another @entity66 battlefield , she says
@entity225 : @entity22 's involvement in @entity41 three decades *ago* tells us what could *transpire*
we should keep in mind @entity72 's national security doctrine of 1984 , she says
