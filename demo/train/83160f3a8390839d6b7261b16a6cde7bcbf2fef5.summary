@entity0 -- @entity2 being treated on a @entity4 hospital ship are requiring longer care than expected , forcing the @entity6 and other international agencies to scramble for an alternative			1
the solution involves plans for a 3,000 - to 5,000 - bed temporary hospital on land , for continued care , because the ship is reaching its treatment limit , according to gen. @entity16 , the senior officer in charge of military operations in @entity19			1
the @entity20 , the @entity4 's hospital ship sent to assist in aid efforts , has performed more than 200 surgeries and treated more than 1,000 patients injured in the january 12 earthquake , and has been bolstering its medical staff to keep up with the demand			1
" it 's used up the clinical capacity before we reach the bed - space capacity , " @entity16 , commander of the @entity28 , said at a @entity30 briefing thursday			1
" the effort that we have ongoing right now for the discharge is looking to put together a facility where we have the ability to recover those patients -- and be able to provide them with that recovery space and time that they need , " @entity16 said			1
he said the initial effort would be to make a temporary facility on land the @entity2 government has identified , with the facility consisting of tents and cots and whatever other resources can be scrounged together			2
earlier this week the head of the @entity6 military 's aid relief in @entity2 told reporters the military was assisting in getting together components of a large facility with 3,000 to 5,000 beds , to handle the health needs in @entity2			1
lt. gen. @entity61 said the @entity6 military would provide medical equipment , but the @entity64 is working with other aid organizations to staff it and contractors to build it			1
it 's not clear where the hospital will be but military officials say it will be just outside of the capital , @entity74			2
some patients discharged from the ship to continue care at home have no home to recover in , according to witnesses			2
gen. @entity16 said the @entity6 government 's joint task force in @entity2 is working in a , " very concerted effort " to put the medical facility together			2
the @entity4 is also taking care of patients on three other ships -- the @entity89 , a aircraft carrier ; the @entity91 ; and the @entity92			0
the ships are supporting efforts in other parts of the quake - ravaged country and are complete with operating rooms and dozens of hospital beds and medical personnel			0
" we 'll look to see how we can improve this better			0
but it 's an ongoing process because of the magnitude of the need , the difficulties as we 're working through the infrastructure to meet the needs , " @entity16 said			0
@entity16 , talking about the cost of the operation , said he had not been placed under any financial limits			0
" the focus is on meeting the needs of the @entity2 people , " he said			0
in response to criticism that there were still people who have not been able to receive food or aid , @entity16 said he does not have an accurate number of how many or exactly where they might be			0
" we 're still having to move around and find those pockets for food distribution , and so it 's really a communication and a continuing effort to get out to every spot that there is in the country , " he said .			0
