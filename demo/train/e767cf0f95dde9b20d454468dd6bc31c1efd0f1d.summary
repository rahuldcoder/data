-- smog is a common sight in @entity3 , with the amount of polluted days increasing by 28 percent to 303 so far this year			1
@entity5 would be quick to point the finger at @entity8 factories across the border			0
yet , research is increasingly indicating that the problem is much more localized , coming from emissions produced by shipping			1
" what we know in @entity3 is that up to 50 % of pollution [ locally produced ] sources come from marine vessels , " said @entity14 , administrator at the @entity16 @entity15			1
smog levels within the city of over 7 million reached hazardous levels earlier this week , with particles in one urban area , @entity27 hitting a @entity28 , hitting 91.7 micrograms per cubic meter of air			2
anything above 71 is classified as " very dangerous " according to the @entity32 guidelines			0
maritime pollution in @entity3 is blamed for the most sulfur dioxide - related deaths within the region			1
according to a recent report jointly compiled by the @entity38 and the @entity39 , @entity3 saw 385 deaths caused by the hazardous chemical , for which shipping is to blame			1
the city lacks regulations in tackling maritime pollution , as there is no legislation or requirements for shipping companies to switch to cleaner fuel when entering @entity3 waters			1
@entity52 , associate professor at the @entity54 's @entity53 noted the @entity56 hub would continue to see a growth in the amount of pollution from container ships under current lack of regulations			1
he linked this to an ever - increasing flow of marine traffic coming through the city			0
however , the government is slowly starting to become more aware of the situation , said @entity68 - wing , head of transport and sustainability research at @entity38 , a @entity3 thinktank that advises the government on policy			1
" in the past we pointed fingers to @entity76 [ the province neighboring @entity3 ] saying it is the only reason we suffer from air pollution without knowing that there is locally produced pollution			1
but now we are getting a clear picture that we can clean up quicker locally			0
" the city is lagging behind many other hubs in the world such as those within @entity87 and @entity88 , which have regulations requiring vessels to switch to cleaner emitting fuel , an initiative known as the @entity94 ( @entity94 )			0
marine vessels in @entity3 can burn cheaper and more hazardous 3.5 % sulfur oil , while in various @entity94 zones , vessels can not exceed 0.5 percent			1
new regulations by the @entity100 , a @entity101 agency that is responsible for the safety of maritime vessels and works to prevent pollution from ships , is looking into forcing vessels to burn no more than 0.5 percent of sulfur by 2020			1
this applies to bigger container and cruise ships , whilst smaller local craft are dealt with under other regulation			0
@entity113 , managing director of the @entity114 said that the shipping industry has been extremely proactive in switching to cleaner fuels			0
" in 2010 , after discussion and debate , 16 carriers and cruise lines came together in the world 's only truly voluntary commitment to change to a cleaner fuel when at berth or at anchor in @entity3 , " he said			2
that agreement , called the @entity127 cuts port charges by as much as 50 % for those sea vessels that switch to cleaner emitting fuels			0
" @entity131 was put in place for two years , 2011 and 2012 , to show government that the industry could switch fuel and that incentive followed by regulation would be possible , " @entity113 said			0
it was extended until the end of 2013 , but has an unclear future			0
a decision on whether to expand it into 2014 is expected later this month			0
the government is also due to pass legislation next year that will force all marine traffic to comply with more environmentally friendly fuels and introduce an emissions control zone in the territory 's waters			1
without urgent regulations , @entity3 citizens are expected to suffer both short - term and longer - term health effects , such as numerous cancers , putting a burden on the local health system			2
" excess hospitalization , extra treatment , we can translate to money value , " said @entity52 , associate professor at the @entity54 's @entity53			0
" it justifies the government to implement measures to improve the air			0
" the government is attempting to make the public aware of the adverse health affects that the pollution causes by replacing the 18 - year - old air pollution index with an air quality health index from december 30			2
in a recent report , published by the @entity39 , introducing an emissions control zone can cut sulfur dioxide emissions in the @entity174 region by as much as 95 %			2
" what @entity3 can probably benefit from is a renewed sense of urgency in addressing this issue , " said @entity175 , @entity176 @entity3 vice chairman			2
" i think in general , @entity3 understands that it can take the lead by doing what it can to fix the problems here and work with @entity185 to have a regional solution			2

localized pollution from ships becoming a major *contributor* towards the city 's smoggy *skyline*
government is set to introduce legislation on shipping emissions from 2014
@entity3 has the most *fatalities* from sulfur emissions in the @entity200 , according to a recent study
