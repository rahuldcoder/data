@entity2 's state - run @entity1 newspaper is known for political correctness rather than a sense of humor			1
so when a report surfaced this week that @entity8 leader @entity7 had been named the 2012 " @entity9 " , the self - described mouthpiece of the @entity11 cheered its @entity8 comrade on its website -- only this " news " came from satirical @entity16 website , @entity17			1
@entity2 is @entity8 's major ally and aid provider			1
reporting something flattering on @entity7 must have been considered politically correct			2
its website editors even built a gallery of photos to accompany the report , with slides featuring @entity7 riding a horse , inspecting troops and being hugged by female soldiers			2
while the item spiced up the usually staid pages of the website , it led to wave of sniggering as international media lampooned @entity2 state media for being fooled by a bogus report from a well - known purveyor of offbeat humor and satire			1
was the omniscient @entity1 really this gullible or was it the work of a mischievous insider with a penchant for satire ? on wednesday , a woman who took our call at the website 's office in @entity48 insisted that it was " impossible that the @entity1 would quote from any unreliable media -- we do verify our news and sources			2
" the woman , who declined to identify herself , said the story and pictures had been removed a day after being posted			0
but the damage had been done and the @entity17 was relishing the publicity			2
" please visit our friends at the @entity1 in @entity2 , a proud @entity61 subsidiary of the @entity17 , " read its statement			1
" exemplary reportage , comrades			0
" @entity2 micro-bloggers could n't resist getting in on the act too			0
" the world was fooled by the @entity1 , because no @entity2 believes this paper , " wrote @ @entity66			0
so the @entity2 have a sense of humor ? @entity71 , who is writing a book on the cultural history of humor in modern @entity2 , says the @entity2 have " a robust sense of the farcical and the absurd , as well as a keen appreciation of watching those in power screw up			1
" @entity71 , a scholar at the @entity79 on @entity2 in the @entity80 , says " the @entity2 sense of humor runs the same gamut as elsewhere			1
" @entity87 , a veteran @entity2 - watcher and co-author of " @entity89 , " a book on @entity2 literature and culture , said @entity48 people 's sense of humor tends to be " very topical , political and satirical			1
" when a giant statue of @entity95 suddenly appeared in @entity96 , not far from @entity98 's iconic portrait early last year , tongues wagged about what it all signified politically -- was @entity95 back to dislodge @entity98 as @entity2 's spiritual leader ? the statue was moved off the square just as abruptly a few weeks later , prompting some in political circles to joke that the venerated sage , who hailed from rural @entity107 , had been busted for not having a @entity48 residence permit			1
for centuries political satire has been a staple for much of @entity2 humor , and remains so during the @entity61 era			1
in the 1980s , when the first signs of official corruption related to economic reform began appearing , humorists cleverly minted ditties like these : " i 'm a big official , so i eat and drink , eat and drink ... " " it 's not my money we 're spending after all , so eat and be merry and let 's have a ball ! " nowadays , @entity2 writers , artists , cartoonists , comedians and netizens resort to humor and satire to mock , question , challenge and document social phenomena , events and incidents			1
" a lot of @entity2 humor is pun - based and probably always has been , " said @entity87 , who speaks @entity2 fluently			2
" the @entity2 language is exceptionally rich in homonyms and is ripe for punning			0
" much of it can be lost in translation but some does overcome any linguistic limits			0
when some @entity48 residents nicknamed the new @entity147 - designed office complex of @entity148 , @entity2 's flagship television network , " da kucha " ( the @entity152 ) , for its resemblance to underwear , the government tried to give it a nicer sounding moniker			2
" so they tried ' zhichuang ' -- window on knowledge , " recalled @entity87			0
" catchy but worse , because as @entity48 funsters worked out in about a microsecond , it 's also a homonym for hemorrhoid			0
" the @entity2 sense of humor has also become more global , @entity71 said , citing the " @entity164 phenomenon " of spoofing and parody on the internet that started in 2005 and is still popular , especially among tech - savvy youths			1
" it draws strongly on international influences , down to the images , sounds , and texts used in video mash - ups , " he said			0
so if @entity2 humor is so robust , why did the editors at the @entity1 get duped ? " maybe because many @entity2 editors and journalists lack good knowledge of journalism and @entity183 so they find it hard to spot satire , " suggested a graduate student in journalism in @entity48			1
" maybe because there is so much fake news and they lack the ability to distinguish real news from the fake			0
" @entity71 blamed the " pervasive plagiarism of foreign news outlets in the @entity2 official news media , combined with shoddy quality control or fact checking			2
" is there a serious lesson to be learned here ? " the primary lesson that all journalists -- not just @entity2 -- should draw from this is that all information needs to be verified before it is published , " said @entity199 , a lecturer in journalism at @entity201 , who once covered @entity2 for @entity202			0
" since new media such as @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 have made all of us publishers in the digital era , all responsible citizens should verify information before they publish , forward , ' like ' or retweet it			0
" how embarrassed should the @entity1 be ? " extremely , " quipped @entity87			0
" that said , i do hope no one gets sent to a labor camp over it			0

@entity2 news site lampooned after taking an @entity17 satire for a real story
@entity17 reported that @entity8 's @entity7 was " *sexiest* man of 2012 "
the joke belies a strong sense of humor in @entity2 , @entity2 watchers say
@entity2 writers , artists , cartoonists use satire to mock , question , challenge
