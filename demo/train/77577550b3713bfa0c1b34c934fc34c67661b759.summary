@entity0 -- president @entity2 called monday for political will from both parties to fix what he described as the country 's " eminently solvable " economic problems in the wake of last week 's downgrade of its credit rating by @entity11 's			1
in remarks to reporters that were added to his daily schedule , @entity2 noted the friday downgrade from @entity17 to @entity18 + occurred because " they doubted our political system 's ability to act " following the grueling negotiations with congressional leaders that preceded last week 's agreement on a debt ceiling increase			1
now it will take political will on the part of @entity30 and @entity31 , the president said , calling on all involved to stop refusing " to put what 's best for the country ahead of self - interest or party or ideology			1
" " we knew from the outset that a prolonged debate over the debt ceiling , a debate where the threat of default was used as a bargaining chip , could do enormous damage to our economy and the world 's , " @entity2 said on a day the @entity37 plunged 634 points in reaction to the @entity11 downgrade			1
" that threat , coming after a string of economic disruptions in @entity53 , @entity54 and the @entity55 , has now roiled the markets and dampened consumer confidence and slowed the pace of recovery			2
calling the situation a " legitimate source of concern , " @entity2 said the " good news " is that " our problems are eminently solvable			2
and we know what we have to do to solve them			0
later at a @entity30 fund - raiser , @entity2 said he inherited the nation 's economic problems			1
" look , we do have a serious problem in terms of debt and deficit , and much of it i inherited when i showed up , " he said			0
" and because of the financial crisis , it got worse			0
so there 's no doubt that we 've got to fix our long - term finances			2
" the nation needs to tackle its budget deficits over the long term , he told reporters earlier , adding that he will be presenting his ideas for how to proceed in coming weeks as a special congressional committee set up under the debt - ceiling agreement begins its work			0
@entity2 offered no details of his plan , and @entity93 press secretary @entity92 also provided no additional information when questioned later by reporters			1
in his remarks , @entity2 said the issue of the most immediate concern to most @entity99 and to financial markets was the slow pace of recovery from economic recession			1
he renewed his call for @entity105 to extend into next year the payroll tax cut that took effect in january as well as funding for unemployment insurance benefits , saying both steps would spur economic activity by putting money into the hands of consumers			2
noting public concerns about the economy , @entity2 declared : " markets will rise and fall , but this is the @entity99			2
no matter what some agency may say , we 've always been and always will be a triple - a country			0
" to tackle the mounting federal deficits and national debt , @entity2 has called for a comprehensive agreement that would cut spending , reform entitlement programs and increase tax revenue			1
" what it requires is that those of us who have the capacity can pay our fair share when it comes to taxes , like we did just as recently as 2000 , when @entity137 was president , and requires us to make some modest adjustments in programs like @entity140 that allow us to get a better bang for our buck on health care , " @entity2 said at the evening fund - raiser			1
" and if we did those things over the course of 20 , 30 years , because this is a 20 - or 30 - year problem , then the problem would be solved , " he said			0
" it 's not rocket science			1
and it does n't require us to decimate the things that we know are going to help us grow and become competitive			0
" @entity31 oppose any kind of tax increase , and many reject increased tax revenue even if the tax rates remain the same or are lowered			0
the tax revenue issue , as well as the scope of entitlement reforms , have been the main stumbling blocks to a major deficit reduction deal			0
" over the next several months , there will be tremendous pressure on @entity105 to prove that @entity11 's analysis of the inability of the political parties to bridge our differences is wrong , " said @entity93 majority leader @entity162 said in a memo to @entity31 members			1
" in short , there will be pressure to compromise on tax increases , " he said			2
" we will be told that there is no other way forward			0
" the special congressional committee set up under a debt ceiling deal will comprise 12 members -- six @entity30 and six @entity31 -- from the @entity93 and @entity180			1
it must present its recommended package of deficit reduction steps by november 23 , and @entity105 must vote on the package with no amendments by december 23			0
congressional leaders have until august 16 to appoint members to the special committee			0
