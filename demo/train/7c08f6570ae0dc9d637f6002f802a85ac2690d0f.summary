-- it has been a rocky couple of years for the people of @entity3			1
since the 2011 revolution , the economy has tanked , street protests are an almost daily occurrence and the political situation remains volatile			0
however , a handful of young @entity3 have found that the best way to take a stand against the turmoil is with stand - up comedy			1
" we are like a little beam of sunlight , coming through and reminding people , ' do n't worry ! when this cloud passes , it will be brighter			1
it will be happier , ' " says @entity20 , a comedian in one of @entity3 's first home - grown comedy troupes , @entity24			1
the group , whose name means " @entity29 , " was formed in 2009 by @entity30 , who admits he started up with " zero capital			2
" @entity30 and some friends pooled their savings , and started marketing the group through social media			2
when they 're not performing , @entity24 teaches the art of stand - up to other aspiring comics , instructing them on things like timing and body language			1
" we 're not the funniest people in the world , but it 's the experience that has put us in a position to give them advice and tell them , ' these are our mistakes , and this is what you can do to avoid what we did , ' " says @entity30			2

" it 's an @entity67 art. we took it from the @entity67			0
we have reshaped it to adapt to our culture and society and people , " says @entity70 , 24 , a comedian who is also a banker by day			0
@entity75 , who also performs stand - up with @entity63 , notes that given @entity62 's political climate , there are limits to what he can joke about			1
" we ca n't talk about politics , or very sensitive topics , like sex or religion , " he notes			0
for those comics in the @entity87 who do n't censor themselves , comedy can be a risky business			1
earlier this month , @entity3 satirist @entity91 made headlines after he was charged for mocking both @entity93 and @entity3 's president , @entity94			1
other comics in the region have faced similar fates			0
@entity98 , a @entity99 producer of a political puppet show , was imprisoned for corruption charges , and @entity103 blogger @entity102 was jailed last year for mocking religious figures			0

" if i ever read a newspaper that said , ' @entity116 was indicted , ' i would say , ' @entity119 , mom , this is it ! ' i 'll fly out of here , but i would be like , ' i got kicked out of my country for being too damn funny ! ' "			0
