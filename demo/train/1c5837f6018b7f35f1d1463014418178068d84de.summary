@entity0 -- when @entity5 supporters @entity3 and @entity6 decided to throw the congressional candidate a fundraiser in 1972 , they charged $ 2 for the ticket , picked up the costs for the steak , salad and baked potatoes and gave the funds raised to @entity5 's campaign			2
reported attendance : 20 people			0
forty - two years , 37 @entity22 events and countless pounds of beef later , the event that started as a small fundraiser for a little - known congressional candidate has turned into the most important political event in @entity25 and a must - stop for @entity27 thinking about a run for the presidency			1
" @entity5 himself declared his candidacy for president at the event in 1991 , putting the event on the presidential map			0
@entity27 presidential nominee @entity36 came to @entity25 the next year to address 5,000 excited @entity25 supporters at the most attended event to date			1
in 2006 , then - sen. @entity39 spoke at the steak fry , delivering a speech that helped catapult him into presidential contention			1
@entity39 was back in 2007 , joined by @entity43 and other @entity27 contenders vying for the presidency			1
more than 15,000 people attended the 2007 event			0
@entity36 went on to finish a disappointing third in 2008 , a finish that was an early sign of things to come for her first presidential run			0
but she will be back this year for the final installment of the steak fry ; @entity5 is retiring from the @entity56 next year			1
@entity36 and @entity43 are headlining sunday 's event , raising the specter that the former first lady and secretary of state will consider running for president in 2016			1
@entity36 has admitted she is considering a run and this weekend will be the first time she visits @entity25 -- the critically important first - in - the - nation caucus state -- in six years			2
republicans are hoping to remind @entity67 of that failure , but with 2016 hopes anew , @entity36 's most ardent supporters are starting to organize in @entity25			2
ready for @entity43 , a super pac urging @entity36 to run for president and staffed by some of her former aides , has been running phone banks in @entity25 and @entity0 , urging @entity27 to buy tickets and attend the event			1
the night before the event , executive director @entity78 said the pac would make its first donation to a campaign			0
it will max its donation to @entity84 , giving the @entity56 hopeful $ 2,600 at a fund - raiser			0
the group has also purchased a billboard in @entity88 , plans to bus supporters from local colleges to the event and will hand out lawn signs and free t - shirts			2
" @entity99 and our supporters look forward to honoring sen. @entity5 's legacy and continuing our work to support @entity25 @entity27 in 2014 , " the group said in an email to supporters , making no mention of @entity36 's possible 2016 bid			1
but the group has also committed an undisclosed , sizable amount of money to promoting the event			0
ready for @entity43 will have 100 volunteers at the steak fry , some of whom have flown in from around the country			1
the @entity70 is committed to not only bus students from local colleges , but will also pay their entry fee for the event			0
there is a reason for this spending			0
while a spokesman for the group said they consider it " an investment in @entity25 and organizing here , " @entity99 also will receive the names of all the event attendees in a swap with the state @entity27			1
those emails will in turn be used to organize future pac events in the @entity25			2
" i think it is fair to say that this last steak fry was going to be an iconic event no matter what , " said @entity134 , who served as @entity43 's @entity136 co-chair during her 2008 campaign			1
" but now with @entity36 and @entity43 both there , it probably becomes the more important event in @entity143 history			2
" @entity134 added , " if people leave the steak fry thinking @entity36 and @entity43 were very genuine , they will be the big winners			1
" @entity43 is currently leaps and bounds ahead of other possible 2016 challengers			2
a @entity1 / @entity149 poll out friday found that @entity36 53 % of all registered @entity27 contacted in @entity25 said they would support @entity43 if the 2016 caucuses were held today			1
that is more than triple the amount of support that any of her other would - be competitors would receive			0
organizers anticipate 5,000 people will attend the steak fry but say they are planning for more in case the weather is " gorgeous			1
" a ticket to the event costs $ 30 , and the proceeds will be split evenly between @entity5 's pac and the state party			2
more than 200 journalists have requested credentials to cover the event			0
" it will be a @entity5 weekend , " said @entity170 , @entity36 's state director in 2008 and a longtime @entity25 operative			2
held on an idyllic farm in @entity175 , 30 minutes south of @entity88 , the event is part fundraiser , part pep rally , part barbecue			1
nothing at the event is actually fried ; the steaks are grilled			0
and while jokes have been made -- " my only advice to you is do n't eat the steak , get the chicken , " said one political analyst , who requested anonymity to freely discuss the quality of the food -- the event has been more about raising funds for the state party and @entity5			0
@entity25 @entity27 this year have close races up and down the ticket , including for @entity5 's seat in the @entity56 , where @entity197 @entity84 and @entity199 @entity198 are in a dead heat , according to a recent @entity1 / @entity149 poll			1
@entity203 chair @entity202 said he expects -- and hopes -- the focus of the event will be on rallying the base ahead of november 's elections			0
@entity202 echoed the idea that @entity36 wo n't address 2016 -- " you never know , " he added as a caveat -- but noted that @entity36 's attendance will still help if she chooses to run			0
" whether it is raining or cold or hot , it is just the fact that people show up , " @entity202 said			0
" these are the people who knock on doors , make phone calls			0
these are the people who work			0
it is important because you get a chance to connect with these core activists			0
" with the steak fry going away , there will be a noticeable gap in the @entity25 political calendar every fall			1
though many strategists argue that it is impossible to replace the steak fry given its reputation and history , some have pointed to @entity56 candidate @entity84 's annual " @entity237 " event that happens every fall			1
" that would be a logical successor , " said @entity202			0
@entity43 to decide on 2016 presidential run around end of year @entity242 calls for ' political revolution ' in @entity25 @entity1 's @entity244 contributed to this report .			1
