the legislature of @entity3 's @entity2 state must now find a replacement after the governor effectively stepped down , yielding to a growing political crisis over a mass kidnapping			1
after weeks of calls for his resignation , gov. @entity11 on thursday asked for a leave of absence to put the focus back on solving the case of the missing students			2
by law , governors in @entity3 can not resign , so asking for a leave of absence can be a euphemism for stepping down in a crisis situation			0
the state legislature must name a new governor to finish @entity11 's term , which ends next year			1
his critics said @entity11 did n't act quickly enough in the days after 43 students went missing last month or take measures to minimize the impact of the crisis			2
the governor did not agree with that assessment			0
" from the very first hours " of the disappearance , the governor said , " the state government took immediate measures to detain police officers who were directly involved and other individuals who were identified as participants in these criminal acts with the purpose of locating the missing students and pay the necessary attention to the victims			1
" @entity3 's attorney general this week issued arrest warrants for the former mayor of @entity43 , the city where the students were kidnapped ; that official 's wife ; and the city 's former public safety director			1
attorney general @entity49 called the three the " probable masterminds " of the september 26 events in @entity43			1
that day , students from a teachers college in nearby @entity54 were on their way to stage a protest in @entity43			1
when former mayor @entity57 and his wife learned the protest would disrupt an event led by the latter , they gave orders to public safety director @entity62 to send police forces to prevent the students from protesting			1
" the order to confront those people came from the police department 's command center , straight from @entity71 , code name used to identify the @entity43 mayor , " @entity65 said			1
the attorney general said his office learned the information from interrogations of police officers and gang members detained in the last month and allegedly involved in the incident			0
police blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students as they arrived in buses and a van			2
footage from the scene showed a white van left in the @entity90 with its windows blown out and the doors wide open			0
officers took the students away , @entity65 said , then handed them to a local criminal gang known as @entity97 ( @entity98 ) , which not only had infiltrated the police department but was also complicit with @entity100 , his wife and the public safety director			2
all three disappeared the day after the clashes between police and the students			2
members of the @entity3 federal police and army have taken over the @entity109 and assumed all security responsibilities			0
the students remain missing , and 53 people , including 36 officers and 17 suspected gang members , have been detained			0
the recent discovery of 28 bodies in mass graves in @entity2 turned out not to be connected to the missing students			1
a roman catholic priest and well - known activist who works with migrants and trafficking victims revealed details this week about the kidnappings , saying the students were forced to walk to a remote location and then shot			1
" some who were wounded but still alive , with others who were already dead ... were put on top of firewood and set on fire with diesel , " the rev. @entity127 said			0
he said he has given his information to prosecutors			0
the case has become a political crisis , with opposition lawmakers asking president @entity139 to dissolve the entire @entity2 state government and take charge			1
@entity139 has said his government will not spare any efforts until the students are found and justice is done			0
" violence , whatever its origin , goes against what we are as a country			0
violence will never be a solution or pave the way toward a better future , " the president said			0
