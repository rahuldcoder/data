thanks to testimony and " real - time " video , lawmakers said they got their clearest picture yet thursday of the deadly attack on a @entity7 diplomatic compound in @entity8 , though questions and tensions remain as to how president @entity12 's administration handled the matter			1
republicans and @entity15 who attended closed - door sessions of the @entity18 and @entity19 intelligence committees described what they heard and saw as informative , albeit not necessarily conclusive			2
they vowed to keep asking questions , and keep holding hearings , to determine not only how ambassador @entity22 and three other @entity7 died but also whether officials were forthright in the attack 's aftermath			2
" a lot of light was shone on this situation , " sen. @entity26 said after a hearing of the @entity28 , which she chairs			1
" but we do n't have all the facts yet			0
we are , in effect , fact - finding			0
" added the committee 's vice chairman , @entity39 @entity14 @entity37 , " were mistakes made ? gosh , we know mistakes were made , and we 've got to learn from that			2
" legislators saw a " real - time film ( showing ) exactly what happened " on september 11 in @entity45 , starting before the attack began up " through the incident and the exodus , " said @entity26			1
a source familiar with the @entity51 hearing said the video included shots of @entity22 being dragged out of the building			0
sen. @entity55 , an @entity56 @entity14 , described the footage as " a combination of video from a surveillance camera and a drone			1
" " it gave us a good picture , from the surveillance standpoint , what was happening , " @entity55 said			0
besides learning more about the attack , some @entity14 in recent days have focused on comments made by @entity7 ambassador to the @entity71 @entity70 days afterward , when she suggested the attack came after a protest against an @entity76 video produced in the @entity7			1
several of those @entity14 -- including sen. @entity77 of @entity78 , sen. @entity79 of @entity80 and rep. @entity81 -- have vowed to block any effort to nominate @entity83 as secretary of state should @entity85 step down			2
sen. @entity86 : heads should roll over @entity45 , but @entity83 is not the issue " what is clear is that this administration , including the president himself , has intentionally misinformed -- read that , lied -- to the @entity7 people in the aftermath of this tragedy , " said rep. @entity89 of @entity90 , a @entity14 member of the @entity91 that on thursday convened a panel of experts not directly connected with the @entity45 attack			1
" the arrogance and dishonesty reflected in all of this is a little bit breathtaking			0
" @entity12 himself has stepped into the fray , saying wednesday that those who criticize @entity83 " because they think she 's an easy target , then they 've got a problem with me			0
" his comments did n't appear to dampen @entity14 criticisms of @entity83 and , thus , the @entity12 administration at thursday 's @entity116 hearing			1
a source familiar with that briefing said one @entity14 @entity18 member " got into it " with acting cia director @entity121 and director of national intelligence @entity122 about @entity83 's comments , challenging why they were n't as strong as they should have been on whether an extremist element was involved in the attack			1
@entity12 : @entity14 criticism over @entity83 ' outrageous ' after that hearing , rep. @entity130 echoed the president 's comments on @entity83 , saying those " claiming that the @entity71 ambassador had some different information ... are either unfamiliar with the facts or willfully ignoring them			1
" the @entity90 @entity138 said the ambassador got the same assessment as lawmakers that the violence in @entity45 began with " a spontaneous protest that evolved into something militant			0
" " we were given a very early assessment of events in @entity45 , and we were given an unclassified version that we could share with the public			0
that unclassified version turned out to be inaccurate , as we found out later , " @entity130 said			0
it was not clear if @entity83 's comments came up at the corresponding @entity19 hearing , though @entity26 did say , " we had a good back and forth , and it was not always the easiest thing for everybody			1
" then - cia director @entity159 -- who is set to testify friday before the @entity18 and @entity19 intelligence committees , one week after resigning citing an extramarital affair -- did develop unclassified talking points in the days after the incident , a source who has spoken to him said			1
but he had no direct involvement in comments made by @entity83 , which may have used some of @entity159 ' information but were otherwise distinct , the source said			2
@entity159 is testifying because he wants to clear up " a lot of misrepresentations of what he told @entity173 initially , " said the source , who is directly familiar with the @entity176 chief 's analysis of the situation			1
@entity178 releases official timeline of @entity45 attack he knew " almost immediately " that @entity182 , a loosely connected radical @entity183 group , was responsible for the attack , as suggested by multiple sources and video from the scene , said the source			0
at the same time , a stream of intelligence -- including about 20 distinct reports -- also emerged indicating that a brewing furor over the @entity194 video preceded the attack			0
the @entity196 eventually disproved the reports that film - related protests had anything to do with the attack			0
but this did n't happen until after @entity159 ' initial briefings to lawmakers , in which he discussed all the possibilities , the source said			2
@entity159 ' told @entity207 of @entity208 , @entity210 's sister network , that his resignation was not linked to the @entity45 attack and that he never passed classified information to the woman he was having an affair with			2
@entity159 : i did not pass on classified info			0

" a lot of light was shone , ... but we do n't have all the facts , " sen. @entity26 says
a " real - time " video combined surveillance and drone footage , senators say
a @entity14 @entity18 member " got into it " with intel officials over @entity70 's comments
@entity159 will testify to clear up " misrepresentations " he told @entity173 , a source says
