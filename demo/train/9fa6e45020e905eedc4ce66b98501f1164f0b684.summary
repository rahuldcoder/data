-- lots of love for " 12 years a slave			1
" a big push for " @entity5			1
" nothing for " @entity7			1
" the @entity8 , the little group ( about 100 members ) with the outsized influence , presented the nominations for the @entity12 on thursday morning , and some trends quickly became obvious			2
given that the globes are often used as tea leaf samples with which to forecast the @entity16 of awards shows -- the @entity18 -- what do they indicate ? 1 ) " @entity21 " and " @entity5 " are the front - runners			1
" slave , " the @entity23 film about a free man taken into slavery in 19th - century @entity26 , dominated the proceedings among dramatic films			1
( the globes spread the wealth by having categories for both film dramas and film comedies , and do the same for television shows			2
) it received seven nominations , including nods for best drama , best director , best actor in a drama ( @entity42 ) , best supporting actor ( @entity43 ) and best supporting actress ( @entity44 )			2
" @entity45 " matched that number , earning nominations for best comedy or musical , best director ( @entity50 ) , best actor in a comedy / musical ( @entity49 ) , best actress in a comedy / musical ( @entity55 ) , best supporting actor ( @entity58 ) and best supporting actress ( @entity59 )			2
expect a lot of the same when the @entity18 nominations are announced january 16			2
2014 @entity63 nominations : the list 2 ) you call these comedies ? of the five films nominated for best comedy or musical , none is an out - and - out laugh riot			1
in fact , a couple are as dark as they come -- and probably richer than the nominated dramas			2
" @entity78 , " the @entity80 film about a struggling folksinger in early - ' 60s @entity82 , features an unpleasant lead character who mooches off some friends and alienates others			2
" @entity91 , " directed by @entity89 ( " @entity92 " ) , stars @entity83 as a curmudgeonly old man convinced he 's won a big cash prize ; like all of @entity89 's films , it has plenty of bitter with the sweet			2
" @entity98 of @entity99 " is a three - hour @entity94 film about a crooked financial trader on a headlong rush to trouble			0
there 's no " bridesmaids " - like film in the bunch -- nor , for that matter , a " @entity103 of @entity104			0
" special coverage of @entity108 2014 3 ) " @entity7 " got shown the door			1
in the @entity111 nominations , announced wednesday , " @entity7 " did surprisingly well , earning nominations for ensemble ( the equivalent of best film ) and performers @entity117 and @entity118			1
none of them were nominated for a @entity63 -- and this despite the fact that the @entity12 often appear to hand out nominations based as much on star power as quality			1
sorry , @entity118 : you 'll have to be invited like any other guest			0
also getting short shrift from the @entity8 : @entity94 , who missed out on a directing nod ; " august : @entity134 , " which picked up two acting nominations but nothing for film , director or screenplay ; and @entity140 , though two of his " @entity133 " stars got nominated			0
not that @entity140 would have shown -- the awards - show curmudgeon , who never goes to the @entity18 either , will receive the @entity143 from the @entity8 , but @entity144 is scheduled to accept on his behalf			0
4 ) no @entity147 nomination ? no problem ! ok , so " @entity7 " got stiffed by the @entity12			1
not so for " @entity149 , " which earned a nomination not only for @entity152 -- who did get a @entity111 nod -- but also for the film itself			1
and how about @entity157 ? there 's been little chatter about @entity161 's " @entity160 , " but she earned a best actress ( drama ) nomination			1
the venerable 77 - year - old actor , who 's a one - man show in " @entity169 , " picked up a best actor nomination			1
his snub by the @entity172 may have been wednesday 's biggest surprise			0
5 ) watch out for " gravity			0
" @entity176 's film has a spare screenplay and a small cast			0
indeed , its lack of a true ensemble could have possibly hurt it with the @entity172			0
but @entity183 got an acting nod ( as she did from the @entity172 ) , and the film also earned @entity63 nominations for drama , director @entity176 and its score			1
@entity190 still consider it a front - runner for best picture , and the @entity12 did nothing to dispel that belief			0
incidentally , for all the attention paid to the @entity12 , their real attraction is as a raucous , celebrity - studded party			0
the liquor flows freely and there 's generally a loose , devil - may - care vibe from the winners			0
( no surprise -- this is the award that once gave @entity205 a " new star of the year " honor for the immortal film " @entity208			0
" ) the hosts , once again , will be @entity210 and @entity211 , so expect a good time -- and terrible singing			0
the @entity12 will be broadcast on sunday , january 12			1
the program will air on @entity215			0
keep up to date with the @entity108 tracker			0

@entity63 leaders : " 12 years a slave , " " @entity5 "
" @entity7 " comes up empty , though
@entity166 gets @entity63 nomination ; he was snubbed by @entity223
