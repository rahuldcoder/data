-- season four of " @entity2 , " featuring @entity3 and @entity4 filling in for @entity5 and @entity6 , taped blind auditions recently , and @entity0 had a chance to watch the new judges in action			1
what we saw in our brief glimpse into the new season was that there will be no messing around			1
all four judges , including returnees @entity17 and @entity19 , mean business			2
when we spoke to @entity3 at @entity21 in @entity22 in september he promised to promote a competitive edge , but he is n't the only one bringing that attitude			1
at the audition we saw some friendly competition between @entity3 and @entity4 over one contestant , and when @entity3 bested @entity17 for another vocalist at the audition , he playfully taunted his fellow judge			1
' @entity31 during a junket featuring all four judges and show creator @entity34 , @entity19 confirmed this season will give new meaning to the term " battle rounds			1
" " i would say the competitiveness is up , " he said			2
" we 've replaced @entity5 with somebody that 's just that much more aggressive			1
and @entity6 was always competitive , [ but ] now you 've got four that are just killers up here			1
" @entity17 agreed that @entity4 might be the one they have to watch out for			1
" you have a pregnant , hormonal @entity45 , " he says			2
" she 's ready to bust some heads			2
she ai n't messing around			2
" @entity4 said she is happy to be welcomed with humor , as it shows her she is part of the family			1
" spending some time with these guys , i can only tell you that it is the best -- they joke all the time and make me laugh onstage , offstage , " she said			2
" they have been such great hosts making us , @entity3 and me , feel at home at all times			1
" cover story excerpt : ' @entity2 ' but the battle we witnessed over contestants was real , she insisted : " there 's a lot of competitiveness , of course			2
once we are in the process of trying to get a contestant recruited for our team , there 's a lot of adrenalin , and there 's a lot of tension , but the healthy kind			2
" both of the new coaches believe they bring more than just a new intensity			2
" you ca n't really compare my style to anybody , " @entity3 said			1
" my style is more military than anything , because i 'm all about the preparation and have always been			2
i rehearse a million times to be prepared			0
my style is to make them understand the seriousness of the craft and that they have the very best opportunity to be the greatest or the worst , depending on how you take it			0
" as for @entity4 's approach , she views it as very involved			1
" besides being a singer , i 'm also a producer and writer			0
once i 'm in the recording studio , i am so hands - on , " she said			0
" while i 'm coaching my team i tend to focus on the detail			0
i do n't know if it 's maybe because of the female condition , but men are more focused on the general aspects , and women tend to sort of focus on details a lot			0
and so when i 'm giving directions to my contestants i 'm particularly focused on details			0
" " she plays the female card quite a bit , " @entity17 said			0
" that 's one thing we ca n't compete with , really			0
" ' @entity2 ' renewed for two more seasons as the proven commodities , @entity17 and @entity19 , who between them coached the winning contestants in all three previous seasons , feel they still have an edge			0
" there are many advantages to being the seasoned veteran , starting with we 've seen about 4,000 more auditions , " @entity17 says			1
" we fell into the traps that the newbloods will fall into and dig themselves out of because they are strong , and they will survive , but we know from experience where we 've been , where we 're going , how to get through this			0
but these guys are smart and quick studies , so they are probably going to get better quickly , and it 's going to suck for us because then they will probably win this damn thing			0
" @entity3 brings in his own experience , having mentored @entity141 to the top of the charts , and @entity17 says that does count for a lot			1
" as much as i hate to say this about another coach in the beginning , @entity3 has done what this show has yet to do , " he says			1
" you have launched a superstar , and that 's our goal			0
that 's the show 's goal			1
that 's something we want to do as an institution			0
" the one thing that i hope is to come into this show and be able to score an incredible entertainer that people will talk about for years and years and track it back , " he says			1
" i am kind of a living example of that			0
i started on @entity166 , and my career kind of launched from there			0
" how long he and @entity4 will remain on the show is up in the air			1
" everybody ca n't coach for life , " said @entity34 , " because when you have people with current recording in the game , this is not their job			0
their job is their fans and making music and being live , and so we knew from the beginning that this would happen			0
they all have another life and their schedules			0
" @entity4 concurred that while this is where she is now , her music comes first			1
" we are not judges			0
it 's not what we do for a living , " she said			0
" we have musical careers that we have to attend to , but we are embarking on this great adventure and enjoying it until we feel that we have to get back to our first and most important duties with music			0
