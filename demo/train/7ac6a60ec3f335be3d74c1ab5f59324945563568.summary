-- it 's the world 's last , great wilderness rich in natural resources , like oil and gas			0
but now the frozen seas of the @entity7 are being opened up ; its vast riches unlocked			2
the @entity10 is one of @entity13 's biggest , most powerful icebreakers , and one of the few ships in the world capable of cutting through the thick @entity7 pack ice			1
it does it for one reason : to clear a path for other vessels , so they can take advantage of the frozen @entity7			1
escorted by icebreakers , cargo ships and oil tankers crossing the @entity7 can shave thousands of miles off a journey between @entity29 and @entity30 , saving fuel , and vastly reduce their carbon emissions			1
captain of the @entity10 , @entity33 says the @entity7 's untapped potential is the reason behind the dramatic increase in maritime traffic			1
" we are now seeing the increase of transport flows again			0
there are more and more transport vessels , through routes for ships from @entity30 towards the @entity46 in the @entity47 , " @entity33 said			0
he is concerned that an increase in traffic in the region could have a damaging ecological effect on the @entity7			1
" you ca n't deny that possibility but if you take all the precautions , this is avoidable , " @entity33 said			0
with a water purification plant and waste disposal system , the crew of the @entity10 say the ship 's own ecological impact is minimal			1
it 's also nuclear powered which means low carbon emissions , but , of course , it 's a risky polluter if anything goes wrong -- just one of the many paradoxes of @entity7 ecology			2
take , for instance , the problem of global warming caused by greenhouse gases			1
it is believed to be melting the polar ice caps , making the @entity7 waters even more accessible to shipping , slashing journey times			1
but it 's also opening up the region to exploitation for its oil and gas reserves			0
and as the traffic in the @entity7 increases , so too will the need for icebreakers like the @entity10			1
and not just for clearing routes -- navigating @entity7 waters can be treacherous			2
an incident in january saw several fishing boats trapped in the ice			0
it was an icebreaker like the @entity10 that broke them free			2
adding more cargo ships and oil tankers to the mix , says captain @entity33 , is a big concern			0
" as a rule , when the traffic along the @entity101 is organized well , emergencies do n't happen , " @entity33 said			0
" it 's when there are errors in the organization that some ships could find themselves in difficult situations			0
with the increase in freight turnover there will be a larger number of ships that will need icebreaker assistance			0
" for their critics , @entity13 's fleet of icebreakers are hastening exploitation of the @entity7			1
but without capable vessels like the @entity10 , these frozen waters may be even more exposed to risk .			2

the crew of the @entity10 say their ecological impact in minimal
