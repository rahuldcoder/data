-- @entity2 's re-election as president of @entity4 on sunday may have surprised many			1
after all , it was only a little over a year ago that social protests swept parts of the country as demonstrators complained that her government had failed to provide quality transportation , education and health care services			0
economic growth , meanwhile , also slowed , from an annual gdp growth rate of 7.5 % in 2010 to 2.5 % in 2013			0
as a result , @entity2 's approval rating tumbled from a high of 65 % in march 2013 to 30 % later that year ( although it had climbed back up over 44 % in recent months )			1
yet she still pulled off a narrow victory in sunday 's runoff vote			0
why ? in part , her re-election suggests that most voters -- especially the poor -- were more concerned with her @entity27 's impressive track record at reducing poverty			0
but @entity2 's re-election also underscored the poor 's fears of selecting a fiscally conservative presidential candidate , @entity33 , who represented the @entity34 , which had done little to improve their lot during the 1990s			1
this matters in a country in which nearly half the population earns less than the minimum wage , and where the poverty rate runs unusually high for a middle - income country			0
still , although poverty rates in @entity4 remain high , there has been progress : income inequality has fallen , while the percentage of @entity4 living on less than $ 2 a day dropped from 6.9 % in 2004 to 3.3 % in 2012			1
this progress has come as the poor 's access to food has also burgeoned , dramatically reducing hunger across the country			0
many attribute all this to @entity2 's successful anti-poverty programs , such as the @entity56 ( @entity58 ) program			1
created in 2003 , @entity56 is a cash transfer program that provides monthly stipends of 70 reais to approximately 13.8 million families			0
to receive this money , families must enroll their children in school and prove they are receiving medical vaccinations			0
but the @entity56 program also provided a notable political advantage			0
the program was created by @entity2 's political party , the @entity27 , the brainchild of her presidential predecessor and mentor , @entity75 , and quickly generated credibility and support among the poor			2
because of @entity2 's other anti-poverty programs , such as @entity80 ( @entity81 ) , which expanded food benefits to the poor , and the @entity83 ( @entity4 without @entity84 ) program , the @entity27 gained a reputation for meeting the poor 's needs			1
in contrast , @entity2 's opponent , @entity33 , represented a party whose previous president , @entity92 ( 1994 - 2002 ) , was focused mainly on stabilizing the economy through tighter fiscal policy and privatization			1
of course , the @entity92 administration was credited with improving education through federal programs increasing salaries for teachers , as well as impressive public health programs , such as the national @entity103 program			2
but poverty alleviation and social welfare did not appear to be a priority for his government , and more voters appear to have felt that @entity4 is in a better position today than it was 10 years ago			2
the question now is what @entity2 will do to consolidate her position			2
looking ahead , she seems committed to using future oil revenues obtained through @entity115 , the largest oil company in @entity4 , to provide additional funding for education and health			1
for example , about half the fund 's reserves will go toward primary and secondary education , such as better school infrastructure , technology , teacher salaries and college scholarships			2
in addition , the fund will be used to increase health care spending , with an eye on improving the quantity and quality of public hospitals and personnel			0
all this suggests that @entity2 appears to have learned that to be re-elected in @entity4 , investing in the poor and helping them escape poverty can be more politically advantageous than simply trying to build the country into an economic giant .			1
