-- facebook on thursday introduced a program that , in effect , offers consumers a financial incentive to watch ads on the site			1
@entity1 will now reward users who watch certain ads on the site with @entity11 , which can be redeemed to purchase goods on @entity13 , the company 's new @entity15 - like daily deals service			1
the incentive , however , is not huge			0
initially at least , the average ad will yield one credit , which is the equivalent of 10 cents			1
the ads will mostly be in games			1
@entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 are among the participating game publishers			0
@entity1 is working with @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 to serve ads on the program as well as @entity32 , which will provide analytics			2
@entity34 , ceo of @entity26 , says that @entity1 's move represents " a step away from interruptive advertising			0
" @entity34 , whose clients include @entity39 and @entity40 , says his network wo n't deliver traditional advertising , but rather branded entertainment , which consumers will want to not only watch , but share with their friends			2
incentivizing consumers to watch ads is one solution for @entity1 's low banner click - through rates			1
the move comes after @entity1 expanded its credits program last week to let consumers use the credits to buy real - world goods advertised in deals			0
previously , the credits , which were awarded for consumers who signed up for various programs ( like magazine subscriptions ) or bought outright could only buy virtual goods			0
