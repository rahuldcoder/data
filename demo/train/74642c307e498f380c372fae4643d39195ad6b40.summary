-- it 's described as the ' @entity2 ' -- a testing 39000 nautical mile challenge that takes crews through some of the most perilous waters in the world			1
the @entity8 is in its first weeks of competition , an adventure that will last nine months			1
at the beginning of this month , six crews set off on the first leg of the grueling race in @entity15 , @entity16			1
their journey will take them across the globe via the ports of @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 -- eventually finishing in @entity29 , @entity30 in july next year			1
it 's predicted millions of people will flock to the shorelines when the boats enter the ports			1
the event 's growing popularity is parallel to the increasing professionalism that surrounds the race , and shows just how much it has changed since it began 38 years ago			1
" our main concern was survival in the first race , " says @entity40 , who competed in 1973 - 74 , when the event begun			1
it was known as @entity47 and featured 17 yachts competing on what was then a 27,000 mile contest			1
although the course was shorter , the journey was much slower and meant that sailors spent a lot more time at sea			2
then the crew 's comfort was considered			2
there was space for sailors to play cards during the down times and guitars were brought on board for night time sing - a - longs			2
@entity66 , who skippered ' @entity67 ' in 1973 - 74 , remembers how on some yachts crates of beer were even included in the supplies so the sailors could enjoy a drink			1
" i remember the way the boats were loaded with pallets of beers when in other circumstances even an extra roll of toilet paper would have been a scandal			2
" in modern racing , speed is the driving force behind every design decision			2
the record for the fastest day was set in 2008 , when the @entity85 traveled 687 miles in 24 hours			1
in the early days of the race 's history , 200 miles was considered a very good day			1
but while it may have been slower , in 1973 the crews relied on their wits for survival			1
there was no satellite information -- the first they knew of a storm was when they were in it			2
" our instrument of navigation was n't so far from @entity102 's times , " says @entity66			2
even some former competitors admit they were crazy to embark on such an adventure , particularly when it comes to sailing in the southern ocean			2
" we knew there were whales , we knew there were icebergs , we knew there were storms , " says @entity108 , the skipper of the 1981 - 82 entrant ' @entity110 '			2
" we prepared ourselves to cope with it			2
we were very happy to get around with a full crew			0
" despite all the advances in technology , competitors at sea now are still faced with plenty of danger			0
" down there you are pretty much running on luck anyway , " explains @entity125 , who is this year captaining ' @entity126 '			0
" you 're blasting along			0
you know it would only take a piece of ice the size of a small car to tear the bottom out of the boat and you 're not going to see that with any technology in the world			0
" five sailors have lost their lives competing in the race , including three in the first edition			1
participants are all too aware that the dangers of the event are very real			0
" it 's easy to say that winning the race is the priority , " says @entity149 , skipper of ' @entity150 , powered by @entity151 '			1
" but our number one priority is everybody coming home			0
" the determination and courageous spirit of the yachtsman has remained unchanged throughout the past four decades			0
organizers say it 's one of the most demanding team sporting events in the world , with participants this time around set to face countless challenges in the months ahead like their predecessors			0
sailors will experience temperatures ranging from minus five degrees @entity173 to 40 - plus degrees			0
no fresh food is taken on board , only freeze dried goods are eaten by crewmen and woman , who are also unlikely to get sufficient sleep while competing			0
while many of the personal challenges faced by competitors are similar , one thing that is significantly different is the professionalism of the event			0
" when you reach this echelon in this sport -- the upper echelon -- you get paid pretty well for doing something like this , " says @entity149			0
multi-million dollar sponsorship deals have been signed on on all six boats as well as the event itself			0
there is greater media attention that follows the race , bringing a valuable global audience			1
in each port , separate small races are being held , giving the teams the opportunity to win points , and the event the chance to win over more spectators			0
in @entity15 , several events such as concerts were held to coincide with the start of the race , and more are due to be held in the other ports			1
" we 're in the entertainment business , without entertaining all these guys there is nothing , " explains @entity149			0
but the lucrative sponsorship deals have not taken away the spirit of adventure			0
" there 's not a lot of commercialism at 2am when your spinnaker is out the back of the boat and you are lying on your side , " says two - times race winner @entity221			1
" no matter what you do with it			0
. you can never destroy adventure , icebergs , waves , cold and no sleep			0
you will never destroy the adventure that started this race in 1973			1
