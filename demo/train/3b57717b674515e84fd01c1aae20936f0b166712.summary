-- in much of the northeastern quadrant of the @entity2 , the past few days have seen the coldest weather in about 20 years			1
the @entity5 lows have been dangerously , frighteningly low			0
near the coast , the weather is slightly less cold , but wilder			1
at 7 yesterday morning , the temperature outside here in @entity10 was 53 degrees @entity11			0
this morning as i write , it 's 4 degrees -- that 's 49 degrees different			1
the numbers are indeed extreme			0
but in a larger sense , the current situation in the atmosphere is the norm -- just more so			0
most of the @entity2 lies in the midlatitudes			1
that means , between the tropics and the pole			0
we get our weather from both directions			1
cold arctic air and hot tropical air ca n't easily mix together to make lukewarm air , because the earth 's rotation deflects them sideways			1
the result is the jet stream , a very fast air current that blows from west to east at about the altitude ( coincidentally ) that jet planes fly , along the top of the boundary separating warm from cold			0
( sometimes our @entity43 weather maps show two jet streams , one north of the other			1
the northern one makes a loop around the pole with the coldest air inside			1
this cold air mass with the jet around it is what is being called the " polar vortex " in recent media stories			0
) but the cold and warm air ca n't stay apart forever			0
the jet undulates , forming giant loops and eddies the size of one or more @entity2 states			1
these are high - and low - pressure systems			1
they stir the atmosphere around on a giant scale			0
they can move the air north or south fast enough that it brings some of the climate of the latitude from which it came			1
warm moist air coming north ahead of low pressure swirls around cold air plunging south behind it			0
where they meet at the ground , temperature contrasts sharpen yet further as cold and warm are squeezed together along fronts			0
this is the normal state of affairs here in the midlatitudes			1
our weather is always a study in contrasts , especially in winter			1
it 's just a more extreme contrast right now -- the jet is more distorted , the cold air plunging down harder against the warm			1
to be fair , one could say that any severe weather event is just an extreme case of normal weather			1
in a cosmic sense , @entity96 or @entity97 were also just examples of the atmosphere going about its rounds			0
it 's when the extremes happen to strike people that we have a disaster -- and this cold event , too , is having serious consequences			2
the difference is that @entity96 and @entity97 produced conditions that were extreme by the standards of anywhere on earth			0
these low temperatures , on the other hand , are normal for the @entity116			1
what makes this event extreme is not that the cold air exists at all , just that it 's roaming a little farther than usual			2
why did it happen ? with single weather events , as with single stock market fluctuations or single football scores , we can find proximate causes -- things that happened just before that seemed to cause the event			1
we often ca n't go beyond that , and not just because our abilities are limited			0
the atmosphere is inherently chaotic and unpredictable , to the point that larger causes for single events really ca n't be ascribed meaningfully			0
and , of course , the weather will change again quickly			2
but there can be larger causes for gradual changes in the probabilities that certain types of events will occur			2
global warming is one such larger cause			1
of course , the cold snap which the current jet distortions have brought us does n't contradict the fact of warming			2
it 's the exception that proves the rule			2
this is the coldest weather in about 20 years			1
but it has happened before , and cold weather is happening less often overall			2
as stated in the latest report of the @entity155 , it is " virtually certain " that daily minimum temperatures ( as well as daily maximum temperatures ) over land have increased since 1950			2
globally , 2013 saw the warmest november in recorded history , and in recent times high - temperature records have been repeatedly broken much more often than low - temperature records			2
but low - temperature records will still fall sometimes -- when the jet 's wiggles happen to bring cold polar air to somewhere farther south than usual , or bring it faster than usual , before the sun can warm it			2
some scientists argue , in fact , that global warming may actually cause this to occur more often			1
the argument goes like this : a basic feature of global warming is that we expect the poles to warm more than the lower latitudes			1
indeed , the @entity180 is observed to be warming faster than anywhere else , melting sea ice			2
( this much is indisputable			0
) since our cold snaps are just deliveries of polar air , we might expect them to get less cold			0
most of the time they do , hence long - term warming			2
but because the overall midlatitude temperature contrast has weakened , the jet stream weakens with it			0
the weakened jet , the argument goes , starts to wobble and meander even more than before			0
the deliveries of cold air can come faster , or from farther north , than they used to on these bigger meanders			0
this can overcompensate , at times , for the overall warming			0
this argument has been strongly questioned by other scientists , including myself			0
it is certainly counterintuitive , in that it implies that weaker temperature contrasts globally cause stronger temperature contrasts locally			0
i do n't think the research to date justifies such a conclusion			0
but the research on both sides is all still new and hotly debated			0
events like the current one highlight some of what we still do n't understand about the relationship of long - term climate changes to short - term extreme weather			1
we do understand the basics , though			0
on average , the high temperatures are getting higher , and the lows are getting higher too			1
global warming is as real and serious as ever , it 's just exceedingly gradual compared with the dramatic temperature swings that are still part of living in midlatitudes in winter			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 : we *'ve* seen coldest weather in about 20 years in much of the @entity2
he says the fluctuations of normal winter weather patterns are to blame
@entity230 : the effects of global warming are seen in more *frequent* high temperatures
global warming is real and serious , but it 's more gradual than *seasonal* shifts in climate , he says
