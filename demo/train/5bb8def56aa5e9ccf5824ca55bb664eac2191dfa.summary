a @entity1 court on monday ruled that radical @entity3 cleric @entity2 can be extradited from @entity4 to the @entity5 , where he faces a host of terrorism charges			1
the @entity8 issued its ruling , clearing the way for @entity2 's extradition			0
this means that he can now be moved to the @entity5 , though no date has been set			0
@entity2 faces 11 charges in @entity5 courts , including conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 @entity20 in @entity21 and conspiring with others to establish an @entity24 training camp in rural @entity25 in 1999			1
read more about the @entity2 story the cleric is one of the highest - profile radical @entity3 figures in @entity30 , where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north @entity33 mosque and other terrorism - related charges			1
the @entity36 - born @entity2 -- who is also known as @entity37 -- has previously denied wrongdoing , saying , " they have no evidence against me whatsoever apart from me trying basically to open the people 's eyes about certain principles			2
" monday 's decision , which was signed by seven judges from different @entity1 nations , follows a ruling this spring in which the same court likewise said that @entity2 and four other terror suspects could be extradited			1
the court determined , then and now , that the suspects would not get " ill treatment " in super-maximum security prisons if they are extradited to the @entity5 and convicted in @entity5 courts , according to the @entity1 court 's decision monday			1
that ruling noted that conditions in such @entity5 prisons were in some ways better for inmates than in @entity1 , given that they 'd have access to things like television , newspapers , social visits and hobby - related items			1
it acknowledged the prisoners may be confined in their cells most of the time , but said this is warranted given the charges they face			0
" as concerned ... restrictive conditions and lack of human contact , the court found that , if the applicants were convicted as charged , the @entity5 authorities would be justified in considering them a significant security risk and in imposing strict limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world , " the court ruled			2
the @entity86 issued a statement monday saying it " welcomes " monday 's decision , which also affects several others wanted in the @entity5			0
" we will work to ensure that the individuals are handed over to the @entity5 authorities as quickly as possible , " the office said in its statement			2
the @entity94 , through spokesman @entity93 , similarly applauded the @entity8 's ruling			0
" we are pleased that the litigation before the @entity8 in these cases has come to an end , and we will be working with the @entity100 authorities on the arrangements to bring these subjects to the @entity5 for prosecution , " @entity93 said			2
in addition to @entity2 , the four others who can now be extradited to the @entity5 are @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			1
the court earlier this year delayed its decision on a sixth suspect , @entity112 , so that further information could be provided regarding his mental health issues			0
@entity5 authorities allege @entity112 -- who suffers from schizophrenia , according to court documents , and is now held in @entity118 , a high - security psychiatric facility situated 65 kilometers ( 40 miles ) west of @entity33 -- was @entity2 's co-conspirator			1
all six men were indicted in the @entity5 on various charges between 1999 and 2006 , after which they were arrested in the @entity100			0
@entity109 , for one , is accused of providing material support to terrorists , conspiracy and money laundering			0
if convicted , he could face a life prison - sentence			0
the @entity5 indictment against @entity109 accuses him of conspiring to provide support to terrorists , including helping to ship gas masks to the @entity134 and using @entity5 - based websites to raise money for @entity138 leader @entity137			2
@entity137 claimed responsibility for the @entity140 in @entity141 in 2004 , two years before he was killed by @entity141 agents			0
two men who can now be extradited -- @entity108 and @entity107 were among more than 20 people indicted ( with late @entity146 leader @entity145 among them ) -- are charged in connection with the 1998 bombings of @entity5 embassies in @entity150 , @entity151 , and @entity152 , @entity153			2
@entity107 , for one , could be sentenced to 269 mandatory life sentences if convicted on murder charges tied with the blasts			1
the other four men who can now be extradited could " face discretionary life sentences " -- which they argue would be unfair -- the @entity1 court said			1
" the court did not consider that these sentences were grossly disproportionate or amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment , " the court said .			0

radical @entity3 cleric @entity2 faces 11 terrorism - related charges in the @entity5
he 'd *challenged* efforts to extradite him from @entity4 , but a @entity1 court rules against him
4 others also can be extradited , including @entity107 , who could get 269 life sentences
the @entity5 is " pleased " and will work to extradite the 5 terror suspects , a spokesman says
