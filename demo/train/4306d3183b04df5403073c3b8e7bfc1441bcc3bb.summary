@entity0 -- like most @entity4 mothers , @entity2 was worried about her son 's compulsory military service			1
she has a point -- @entity11 's medical unit is stationed close to the border with @entity13 , which remains a very real threat			1
yet the real enemy was far closer than she could have ever imagined			2
for more than a month , private @entity11 was beaten			1
denied food , the 20 - year old was forced to lick phlegm from the floor or eat his own vomit			0
he was hooked up to an intravenous drip to revive him when he faltered			0
then on april 6 this year , his body could take no more			0
force - fed frozen food as he was being beaten , he simply stopped breathing and died			1
the official autopsy report stated the cause of death as asphyxiation			1
his alleged abusers were half a dozen of his fellow comrades			0
the oldest was just 25			0
extensive bruising it was a sunday afternoon when @entity11 's parents got the call to come to the hospital			1
when @entity11 's two sisters arrived they noticed extensive bruising on his body and questioned the claim that he choked			1
" the military came and started taking photos , " @entity11 's mother recalled			1
" they did n't answer our questions , just took photos and left			0
" it would take months before the full scale of @entity11 's abuse became clear			1
and it did not come directly from the military , rather from a leaked internal report obtained by a military human rights group			1
" the handling of this case is simply not transparent , " said @entity55 of @entity56			0
" we would like the families of the bereaved or the victims to have unlimited access to military information			2
" reforms @entity4 's defense ministry has made some structural changes : parents can now call and visit more often , leave is more flexible and barracks are being updated			1
" the @entity4 military has tried very hard to obliterate violence , " said spokesman @entity70			1
" but recently the violence has resurfaced			0
violence is like a weed , you have to constantly pull it out and some officers probably misunderstood , thinking violence had disappeared			0
" an army survey conducted in april in tandem with the investigation seems to back up @entity70 's suggestion the military became complacent about violence			2
almost 4,000 previously unreported cases of abuse emerged			0
a military dictatorship until the late 1980s , @entity4 has struggled with decades of bullying within the military			1
now , there are calls for more transparency			0
the defense ministry rejects all accusations of a cover up in this case , the spokesman going so far as to say parents thank them for telling them how their sons died			2
bullying culture @entity2 is not one of those parents			2
describing how she felt when she saw her son 's alleged attackers , she said : " my skin shook and everything went dark			2
i could n't control my mind and i could n't move when i saw them ... i wanted to do to them exactly what they did to my son			0
" for @entity2 , the most important thing is that her son did not die in vain ; that a bullying culture within the military will change -- a culture the military claims starts at school			2
" it is pure evil what they did , " said @entity2			0
" a human should n't be able to do that			0
i want a just punishment ... i know you ca n't say something like this will never happen again , but even if it helps a little bit , i hope they get serious punishment			0
" six soldiers are currently on military trial , four have been charged with murder .			1
