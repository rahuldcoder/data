@entity0 -- one could classify the @entity4 people as a throwback			1
numbering a mere 1,300 , they represent one of the last communities of hunter - gatherers in the world			1
their language -- which includes click consonants -- is unrelated to any other on @entity13 , and is possibly one of the oldest spoken languages in existence			0
their dna , too , suggests an ancient heritage , easily 100,000 years old ( and possibly a primary root for mankind 's family tree )			0
their home , near @entity0 's @entity25 , has been dubbed the " @entity28 , " partly because it has unearthed some of the oldest known human remains			0
an ancient way of life many of the @entity4 live in a remote stretch of @entity0 , where much of their day is given over to foraging and hunting			1
the techniques they use for finding sustenance are passed down generation to generation			0
the men favor handmade bows and arrows , while the women dig up roots and gather berries			1
the @entity4 do n't store food , plant trees or build houses			1
rather , they make temporary huts from dried grass and intertwined branches , and move in accordance with the local animals			0
" we are rich in tradition , " explains @entity55 , the first @entity4 to attend university , and an informal spokesperson for his community			2
" culture is very important , because when people forget their culture , they forget where they are from , " he adds			0
mounting challenges unfortunately , the @entity4 way of life is under threat			2
in the last 50 years , they have lost 90 % of their land to farmers and cattle herders , according to @entity74 , an @entity75 in defense of tribal people around the world			1
" without the land , the @entity4 will disappear , " warns @entity55			1
furthermore , a lot of the big game animals and local plants that traditionally have made up the bulk of the @entity4 diet are disappearing			1
" there is a big problem with cows , " admits @entity55			0
" the animals are scared of them and they run away			0
that 's why the hunters have to [ travel ] far to even find little birds			0
" meanwhile , much of the local forest and bush has been burned to make way for crops , or has been razed to produce water holes for irrigation			0
" the @entity4 are suffering much because the natural food is disappearing , " explains @entity55			2
positive signs ? though the threat the @entity4 face is real -- and extinction is far from a remote possibility -- there have been some successful efforts to restore some of what they 've lost			1
in 2011 , for instance , the @entity111 government issued land titles to a community of @entity4 living in @entity115			1
now @entity55 , who belongs to a separate tribe of @entity4 , is hoping he can achieve the same for his community			2
" i belong to the @entity4			2
i study in the name of the @entity4			0
the name of the @entity4 has made me go to university , " he says			0
" now , i 'm going to fight until i see the @entity4 get their land			1

the @entity4 are one of the last communities of hunter - gatherers in the world
@entity4 men hunt for animals using *homemade* bows and arrows
in the last 50 years , the @entity4 have lost 90 % of their land
