-- in the @entity4 poet @entity3 's " metamorphoses , " one of the great works of @entity7 literature , @entity1 of @entity2 rapes his wife 's sister , @entity9 , then cuts out her tongue			1
in " @entity13 , " @entity12 references @entity3 with an even more grotesque rape and mutilation , while including multiple acts of murder , torture and cannibalism			2
@entity20 , associate professor of literature at @entity22 - @entity21 , says , " everyone is traumatized by @entity24			1
" over the last few months , students , faculty and administrators at a number of universities have been debating whether faculty should be obligated to place " trigger warnings " on their syllabi before assigning content that might trigger a traumatic episode in one of their students			1
before assigning @entity3 , @entity12 or any topic about human cruelty and suffering , what should teachers be obligated to tell their students ? proponents of trigger warnings , reasonably , argue that students will be unable to learn when confronted with content that triggers traumatic recollection			1
this is n't about students just being uncomfortable , they say , but about ensuring students do n't have to choose between their education and their sense of safety			1
critics of trigger warnings , also reasonably , contend that education requires pushing students to engage with difficult material that makes them uncomfortable			1
professors worry about academic freedom and having to address a whole cascade of " isms " as they design and execute their syllabi			2
furthermore , they see the focus on trigger warnings now as part of the corporatization of higher education , in which syllabi are designed not to structure learning but to prevent lawsuits			2
professors are concerned about trauma , but do n't want to slap labels on their syllabi that are the equivalent of " caution : this coffee is @entity75			1
" to some extent , both sides are right			2
some students suffer from serious trauma , but there 's no feasible way a blanket policy on trigger warning can really work			1
fortunately , we can solve the situation though a combination of best - teaching practices and the application of pre-existing policies			1
the biggest problem here emerges from the nature of trauma			0
triggers are extremely personal and , from the outside , unpredictable			0
professors can not review their course material and know , with any certainty , what might or might not function as a trigger for their students			1
we worry about surprising students with triggering content and re-victimizing them			1
we do n't need a vague if well - intentioned policy , however , to address most cases			1
instead , let 's just rely on good teaching			1
@entity108 , writer and sociologist , noted that the real problem with triggers is when they catch you by surprise			0
she writes , " trigger warnings make sense on platforms where troubling information can be foisted upon you without prior knowledge , as in the case of retweets			0
" in a classroom , where the subject matter ought to be reasonably transparent , such surprises should be rare			0
we should all know what we are going to encounter in classes on the @entity129 , on human rights law , on the history of race in @entity133 , or countless other clearly labeled topics that of necessity must deal with often graphic and upsetting stories			0
if you sign up for such a class , be ready			0
students might not be so ready for @entity3 or @entity12			1
why not prepare them for the reading ? do n't do it because you are worried about trauma , but because it will help them learn			2
i would never want my students to be surprised by something horrific in their reading , whether the " @entity151 " on " @entity152 " or the rape of @entity9 in @entity3			2
instead , i want them ready to work with challenging texts so they learn			0
spoilers might be bad for entertainment , but they are good for education			2
once most students know what they are likely to encounter in their work , the surprise factor in triggering situations ought to be mitigated			2
for a small percentage of students , however , this kind of preparation may not be enough			2
the word " disability " has been largely missing from the debate on trigger warnings in higher education			0
post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychological disability			0
it does n't just affect soldiers			0
students ( or anyone ) suffering from @entity179 are not just " uncomfortable " when their trauma is triggered			1
@entity181 , a lecturer of @entity182 at @entity183 in @entity184 and a blogger about disability and education , has noted that universities already have , or at least should have , robust systems to ensure compliance with the @entity191 and to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities			1
it would be entirely reasonable to help a student with a disability who is best accommodated by avoiding certain triggering material in the classroom			0
that said , avoidance is not always the best approach for people with trauma			0
one method of treating ptsd is called " exposure therapy , " in which patients repeatedly engage with their traumas in order to desensitize themselves to potentially triggering moments			0
the classroom is not a therapist 's clinic , but the practice does suggest that avoidance is not the only choice			0
moreover , it 's a decision for a patient and a therapist or doctor to decide and advise a university , rather than for faculty or administrators to decide for themselves			0
as educators and as a society we need to respect trauma and create conditions in which healing is possible			0
part of that respect is to recognize that we do n't know how any given person 's trauma might manifest , so we ca n't assume we know what is or is n't a trigger			0
and we do n't have to know			0
if professors follow good teaching practices and help students be ready for the course content as it unfolds , while universities provide well - funded and expert disability support services , we should be ready to handle whatever trigger issues lurk undetected			1
we do n't need a whole new set of warning labels .			1

universities have debated putting warning labels on violent , *abusive* scenes in literature
@entity255 : it should not be necessary to have a new policy of warning labels
good teachers should prepare their students in the course of regular teaching , he says
@entity255 : for students with @entity179 , the *normal* precautions should be taken
