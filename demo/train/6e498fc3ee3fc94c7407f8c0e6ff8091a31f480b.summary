when the rocket scientist @entity2 died in march , the @entity0 celebrated her as the maker of a " mean beef stroganoff " and " the world 's best mother			2
" when my 4 - year - old daughter , @entity8 , a wildly creative and interesting girl , finished a year of preschool last week , her teachers gave her an award for being the best dressed			1
a few years ago at my son 's preschool camp award ceremony , i sat silently as well - meaning counselors called each child forward			1
girls : best hair , best clothes , best friend , best helper and best artist			1
boys : best runner , best climber , best builder and best thrower			2
my son won best soccer player			2
in general , girls received awards for their personalities and appearance and boys for their actions and physical attributes			1
it was similar at my daughter 's ceremony , where the teacher told us that all the children were so excited to see what award they would receive ; it had obviously been built up as a big deal			1
the gender disparity was subtle but present			1
a boy received best engineer			0
a girl got best friend			0
another girl was the best helper , and another most compassionate			0
a boy received best break dancer			0
a girl was named most athletic , and the teacher told us how when all the class raced around the track this girl " beat everyone ! even the boys ! " and then my daughter got her certificate , showing her in a funky orange sweater , tight pants , and holding a bowling ball			1
her award -- best dressed			1
many decades after the feminist movement of the 1960s , why are we still stuck in this gender - norming rut ? more : @entity74 's ' girl rising ' the truth is that my daughter may well be the best dressed in her class			1
she has a terrific sense of style			0
one day she put on a hand - me - down @entity80 princess outfit , looked in the mirror and said , " ok dad , i 'm ready to dig for worms ! " another day , she went to school in a pink dress , green rain boots and a viking helmet			1
i frequently come home to find her in a pirate costume			0
she 's practical and became outraged when she discovered that her " girl jeans " turned out to have fake pockets			0
" @entity95 , " she said , " where am i going to put my pine cones ? " if she 's the best dressed , it 's because of her creativity			1
sometimes , i find the prospect of raising a girl to be terrifying			0
the forces of patriarchy conspire to render girls weak , subordinate and sexually objectified			1
when we respond to infants by gendering our speech , strong for boys and lilting for girls , we immediately start to shape their interactions with the world			1
more : @entity112 's open letter to girls of the world i would once have said nothing was worse than the conspicuous consumption mantras of @entity116 or the female - subjugation messaging of @entity80 , but then i encountered the hyper - sexualized elementary - school girls called @entity119			1
and then there 's underwear			0
boys mostly get superheroes and girls get hearts and flowers , but at least @entity127 is an explorer			2
all too soon @entity8 will encounter the world of @entity131 nightgowns and @entity134 's @entity133 underwear for tweens			0
the teenage years with the new dangers of sex , alcohol , eating disorders and more will arrive before we know it			0
i ca n't save her from all of this , and anyway we buy into purity culture ( the notion that only a father 's constant surveillance can save our daughters ) at our peril and the peril of our daughters			2
our daughters need to be strong , not closeted and coddled			0
we have to arm them with the tools to question , resist and change our patriarchal culture			1
@entity8 's teacher is the kind of smart and strong young woman i want as a role model for my daughter ( she 's also a really snappy dresser ) , and i know she was only trying to make the transition moment special for each student			2
she absolutely intended to celebrate the way @entity8 expresses her creativity through clothes			2
but gender stereotypes are , by their very nature , pernicious			1
they creep into our minds , shaping our perceptions of the world on a subconscious level , tricking us into betraying our values			0
our culture constantly projects the message that only appearances matter , and this message is aimed squarely at our children			2
we can fight this only by working against the grain , resisting gendered language and emphasizing the internal over the external			0
if my daughter 's creativity shines through in her choice of clothing , then celebrate both that creativity and the critical thinking that lies at the heart of all creative acts with a most creative award			2
or we could just let @entity8 tell us what she wants us to celebrate			0
when she picked up her award , she beamed at the picture of herself holding the bowling ball so proudly			0
" daddy ! " she said , " i won best bowler ! "			0

@entity200 : at preschool , daughter named best dressed ; prizes ran along gender lines
he says gender stereotyping starts with the way we talk to girls as babies
he says @entity80 princesses , sexy clothes , dolls point girls at sexual subjugation , weakness
@entity200 : resist stereotypes , arm girls to question and change patriarchal culture
