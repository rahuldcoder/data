-- the baseball players posed for a team photo of sorts -- but the signs they held had nothing to do with home runs or striking out			1
two of them toted a @entity10 flag with " sos " scrawled across the top			1
one knelt in front with a sign that said " pray for @entity16			2
" another held a banner that read , " lejos pero no ausentes " ( far away but not absent )			2
the @entity21 teammates snapped the photo last week in a locker room in @entity24 , @entity25 , their spring training base			2
a group of @entity28 posed for a similar shot this week , holding @entity10 flags as they stood beside a baseball diamond in @entity32 , @entity25			1
they may be rivals on the field , but the players from both teams share something in common : concern about events unfolding in their homeland , more than 1,500 miles away			1
weeks of massive street protests in @entity16 have left at least 13 people dead , more than 100 injured , and dozens detained after clashes between members of the opposition , backers of the government , law enforcement and armed groups			1

but not all the responses were positive			0
some described them as hypocrites , slammed them for seeming to take sides or criticized them for not taking a firm enough stance			0
in the polarized world of @entity10 politics , there are no referees who step in to break up a fight			1

if you support someone , others attack you , and vice versa			1
and if you are neutral , you are not @entity10 , " @entity66 wrote back in response			1
" what a sad reality			0
" some players ' online posts have included the # sosvenezuela tag used by members of the opposition to draw attention to @entity16 's crisis			1
others have said they are n't taking a political stand -- just pushing for peace			0
the posts have drawn a response from @entity10 president @entity127 himself			1
in televised remarks , he implied that players were n't expressing their true feelings			1
" @entity10 @entity75 players are being pressured to appear in portraits that say @entity16 , " @entity127 said			1
" the owners of the @entity75 teams have pressured our men			1
" @entity71 did n't mince words when he fired back on @entity138			0
" the only pressure we have is winning games , hitting and catching , " he wrote			0
" @entity141 and feelings are not pressured			0
" the face of one @entity28 coach , @entity144 , normally lights up when he talks about his home country			1
but now , weighing the situation , he says he 's overcome with sadness and feeling tense			0
" we never thought we were going to get where we are today			0
... you feel so impotent not being able to do anything from here , just supporting our families and the @entity10 people			1
and really , for all these people who have lost family members , it is so hard , " he said			0
it 's like a ticking time bomb			0
really , you do n't want it to continue			0
you want it to stop , once and for all			0
" it 's not just baseball players and coaches speaking out about @entity16			2
