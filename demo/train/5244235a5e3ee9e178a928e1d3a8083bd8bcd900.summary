on his recent visit to @entity2 , president @entity0 called on both our nations to let go of attitudes " trapped in old stereotypes			2
" sadly , a column written for @entity14 by @entity15 -- " should the @entity12 be more like @entity2 ? " -- makes just the sort of sweeping generalizations about a diverse country of 110 million people that the @entity12 president urged us to avoid			1
it might come as news to @entity15 that the @entity2 of his grandparents , which still seems to inform his view of the country , is no longer an accurate description of a nation that , in 2013 , has a growing , sophisticated middle class and is a relevant and responsible actor in global affairs			1
because @entity15 says @entity12 should be fully informed on the matter , his misinformed and outdated characterization of @entity2 society deserves some correcting			1
with regard to immigration , @entity2 respects the sovereign right of the @entity12 to determine its own immigration policy , and the @entity12 people and their political representatives will ultimately determine what course that policy takes in the @entity12			1
@entity15 's depiction of @entity2 's immigration policy , however , is inaccurate and outdated			1
to my knowledge , no @entity2 official has ever expressed a desire for a porous northern border			0
moreover , in 2011 , @entity2 passed its own immigration reform focused on the decriminalization of immigration and providing protection for migrants , regardless of their migratory status			1
the legislation earned praise from the @entity56 and established a solid framework to assist in the protection of migrant rights while better aligning @entity2 's domestic policy with international treaties on migration			1
those significant steps do not merit an easy dismissal with a rhetorical wave of the hand			0
they are meaningful changes that will affect lives			0
@entity15 's column goes on to paint @entity2 as desperate to escape their home country , but the numbers tell a very different story			1
according to a 2012 report by the @entity77 , migration between the @entity12 and @entity2 is at net zero			2
and a recent @entity80 survey found that only 11 % of @entity2 would like to change their country of residence ; that number is identical to the 11 % of @entity12 who say the same thing			2
by 2010 , around 40 % of @entity2 's population had joined the ranks of the middle class , according to data from @entity91 , @entity2 's national bureau of statistics			1
the characterization of @entity2 as a bifurcated country of rich and poor is less accurate than ever , and according to in - depth research from economist @entity96 and writer @entity97 , authors of " @entity2 : a @entity100 , " that trend is expected to continue			0
it is not something that has happened by accident			0
to say , as @entity15 does , that @entity2 " has no real economic policy beyond tourism " is not to be paying attention			1
@entity2 's fiscal discipline , which will include another balanced budget this year , has led to the steady macroeconomic growth that is directly responsible for lifting many @entity2 into the middle class			1
our tourism industry , which also somehow appears to be worthy of @entity15 's disdain , does so well because @entity2 is heir to two of history 's greatest civilizations , and is a country of astounding natural beauty			1
the @entity2 government embraces those realities and so do the millions of visitors we welcome , who generated $ 11 billion in revenue last year			0
but the idea that @entity2 is content to rest on its tourism industry requires willful blindness to the transformations taking place in our nation			0
as a result of unprecedented agreements between the country 's main political parties , @entity2 has recently pushed through large - scale reforms to education , anti-trust laws and legal procedures , with energy reform still on the agenda			2
does that sound like a country with no real plan beyond tourism ? the administration does have a @entity147 , although @entity15 claims it does not exist			0
the tone of the column pits @entity2 and the @entity12 in a sort of competition , deeming one of our countries " superior " to the other			1
for our part , we stand by the @entity157 that affirms the sovereign equality of all its members			0
careless comments about superiority easily lend themselves to racism and xenophobia			0
thankfully , bilateral cooperation between our nations has long since moved beyond such thinking			0
twenty years after the implementation of @entity168 , @entity2 and the @entity12 have become global partners			2
our relationship is not one of competition and rivalry but of synergy and complementarity			0
for example , the @entity176 has estimated that nearly 40 % of @entity2 exports to the @entity12 contain components manufactured in the @entity12 @entity2 is also the second largest export market for @entity12 goods			1
in fact , according to the @entity184 's @entity2 institute , some 6 million @entity12 jobs depend on trade with @entity2			1
our nations build things together to sell here and abroad , and business is booming			0
in 2011 , trade between our two countries reached $ 500 billion			0
but we share more than business and value - added chains -- we share geography and people			2
our people live together , work together and break bread together			0
given that 30 % of immigrants in the @entity12 are of @entity2 origin and @entity2 is home to the largest community of @entity12 expatriates in the world , both our countries have a responsibility to ensure that we continue to grow together			2
@entity2 and its people are evolving , and both our countries are stronger for it			2
if i may invoke the words of president @entity0 once more , " it 's time to put old mindsets aside			0

@entity213 : @entity15 's column full of misinformation about @entity2
fewer @entity2 moving to @entity12 , he says , and @entity56 lauds @entity2 's immigration reform
@entity2 's balanced budget and economic growth lifting many into middle class , he says
@entity223 : @entity12 , @entity2 trade booming ; nations share geography and people
