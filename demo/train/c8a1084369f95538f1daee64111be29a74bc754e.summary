@entity0 , @entity1 -- a top @entity4 political leader delivered a message friday to president @entity6 , calling his attempt to lure away @entity4 fighters with money " an old weapon that has failed already			1
" " the mujahedeen of the @entity14 of @entity1 are not mercenaries and employed gunmen like the armed men of the invaders and their surrogates , " @entity11 said in the statement			2
" this war will come to an end when all invaders leave our country and an @entity26 government based on the aspirations of our people is formed in the country			0
" @entity30 is the deputy emir of the @entity14 of @entity1 , which is the political arm of the @entity4			2
he was referring to the @entity4 reintegration provision , part of the $ 680 billion defense appropriation bill that @entity6 signed wednesday to pay for military operations in the 2010 fiscal year			1
the provision would separate local @entity4 from their leaders , paying the fighters to quit the organization , replicating a program used to neutralize the insurgency against @entity44 in @entity45 , according to the sen. @entity46 , chairman of the @entity47			1
@entity11 said 19th century @entity49 invaders and @entity51 fighters in the 1980s tried the same tactic , unsuccessfully			2
he said the @entity4 consider the @entity44 measure " a sign of weakness and complete despondency of the enemy			1
" @entity6 is considering whether to approve the request from his top commander , gen. @entity59 , for as many as 40,000 additional troops in @entity1			1
the decision is being weighed against the backdrop of suddenly spiraling @entity44 military fatalities			2
fifty - six @entity44 troops have died in @entity1 in october , the highest @entity44 monthly toll since the war began eight years ago			2
@entity6 meets friday with the @entity67 , who will tell the @entity44 leader how a large deployment to @entity1 would affect the military			0
@entity11 warned @entity6 against maintaining a military presence in @entity1 , saying it " will only deepen your economic crisis and will harm your international reputation			0
" " pull all your forces out of our prideful country and put an end to the game of colonialization by shedding the blood of innocent @entity85 people under the unjustified name of terrorism , " he said			0
the @entity4 reintegration provision is part of the @entity90 , which is now receiving $ 1.3 billion			1
@entity90 funding also is intended for humanitarian relief and reconstruction projects at commanders ' discretion			0
" @entity1 leaders and our military say that local @entity4 fighters are motivated largely by the need for a job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal , " @entity46 said in a @entity47 floor speech on september 11			1
" they believe an effort to attract these fighters to the government 's side could succeed , if they are offered security for themselves and their families , and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us			0
" while the plan has a " reasonable chance for some success , " analyst @entity119 said that it may not be a long - term solution			1
" so long as the @entity44 are keenly aware of this , you 're buying a very , very , very temporary allegiance , " said @entity119 , an expert on the @entity1 - @entity125 region for the nonpartisan @entity126			1
" if that 's the foundation for moving forward , it 's a shaky foundation			0
" @entity132 , @entity2 security analyst , said the idea of paying off @entity4 members to quit is nothing new			1
" there 's been an amnesty program for low - level @entity4 in place for many years now , and thousands of people have taken advantage of it , " he said			2
" so this is not entirely a new idea			0
the idea of bribing people , local guys , to come over			0
... it 's one of the most cost - effective ways to get people to lay down their arms , either to negotiate a peace or coerce them			0
" @entity59 has backed the @entity4 reintegration plan , saying that most are not ideologically or even politically motivated			1
" most of the fighters we see in @entity1 are @entity1 , some with [ a ] foreign cadre with them , " he said in a july 28 @entity154 interview			0
" most are operating for pay ; some are under a commander 's charismatic leadership ; some are frustrated with local leaders			1
" @entity2 's @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
