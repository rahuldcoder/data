he owns more than a hundred of them , sometimes changing into a different watch multiple times a day			1

" i will more than likely have to wear one on each wrist			0
" unfortunately for @entity10 , most people will only wear one watch			1
the question is , will they choose the @entity11 over a classic timepiece ? after three years of development , @entity10 finally gave the world a look at its new smartwatch on tuesday			1
it wo n't be available until early next year , but the design is final			0
whatever the reviews , it 's guaranteed that @entity10 fans will camp out in line for one , and early - adopters and watch lovers like @entity1 will gladly drop $ 349 to slip it on			1
but to succeed , the @entity11 will also have to appeal to regular people as a fashion accessory			1
the company has hired and collaborated with big names from the fashion industry , including watch designers like @entity40 , @entity42 's @entity41 and @entity44 's @entity43			1
those fashion bona fides will help @entity10 's watch appeal to people who see the item as a fashion statement			1

last year , watches were an $ 8.3 billion industry in the @entity55 , according to @entity56			2
most watches sold are sub- $ 150 quartz watches , but $ 1,000 and up luxury mechanical watches from brands like @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 have been surging in popularity			0
" watches , unlike other consumer electronics , have existed for hundreds of years as accessories and fashion pieces , " said @entity65 , a research analyst at @entity56			2
the smartwatch industry is a relative newborn			1
only 750,000 smartwatches were sold in the @entity55 in 2013 , compared to 123 million smartphones and 32 million regular watches , according @entity65			0
so far , the most popular smartwatch is the @entity76 , which got its start on @entity78			2
smartwatches from companies like @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 have been plagued by clunky , large screens and glitchy software			0
" @entity10 is definitely in the business of making markets as opposed to breaking into them , and this market has yet to be made , " said @entity65			1
related : ' @entity90 ' may be safer than plastic the heart of the @entity11 is a square touchscreen with rounded corners that comes in different metal finishes , including 18 carat gold			0

the face of the watch is customizable and can display the time in a number of analog or digital designs			0
the final product is a typically @entity10 design : clean with a kick of personality			2
" i do n't think it will replace the traditional timepiece , but i do think it is the most aesthetically pleasing wearable that has come to market to date , " said @entity111 , style director at @entity112			0
" i would wear it , but probably not every day			0
" @entity10 has smartly included styles and a smaller watch face size to appeal specifically to women , a group mostly shut out by the gigantic smartwatch screens already on the market			1

" the good thing about the @entity10 watch is that it 's super buzzy right now so people will notice it without needing a ton of other accessories that might try to compete for the spotlight , " said @entity124			1
no matter how useful it is , once a wearable device is written off as un-cool , it marks the wearer as dorky			0
not everyone believes the @entity11 can avoid the stigma of a @entity155 headset -- or even @entity156			1
" @entity161 is the ultimate in geek chic , designed to look like a watch , but it leaves something to be desired when it comes to reflecting personal style , " said @entity157 , vice president of product at @entity158 , a trendy @entity160 watch company			2
it " will certainly raise people 's expectations about what a watch can do			2
... but it appears to compete more with the likes of @entity175 , fuel band and other smartwatch offerings , more so than traditional watches			0
" beyond looks , @entity10 will also have to overcome a limited battery life and dependence on the @entity182			2
but if any technology company has a chance of stealing precious wrist real estate from established watch companies , it 's @entity10 .			1

@entity10 's new smartwatch was designed to be a fashion accessory as well as a *gadget*
it comes in two sizes , different finishes and has multiple slick strap options
@entity10 is going up against huge watch companies and an industry that has been around for a century
the device could be the next @entity200 or it could go the way of the @entity155 headset
