-- tourists become volunteer rescue workers			1
the connected provide power outlets and @entity4			2
doctors work overtime to keep hospitals running and patients alive			2
in the wake of @entity14 , which ripped so much apart , people have come together			1
for every story of devastation we 've seen in the month since @entity14 hit , there have been dozens of untold stories of good samaritans , quietly helping get things back to normal in whatever way they can			1
many offered their services in traditional ways -- donating money to relief efforts or helping to rebuild homes on the weekend			2
others , though , found unorthodox but equally beneficial ways to help			2
here are just a few of those stories : going on with the show the day after @entity14 hit , @entity37 actor @entity36 thought about what he and his fellow performers could do for the city			1
@entity42 shows had been canceled , but @entity36 , who played mr. @entity43 in " cats , " had the idea to do a little singing and dancing anyway			1
so he got a message out to the theater community via @entity50 : " there is a lot of devastation in our beloved city and for some reason we here in @entity58 have been spared , " it read			1
" i just walked over to @entity59 and people are looking for something to do			2
i think we should all get together and sing some songs for these people			2
... it 's not much but its a little something we can do for the city			1
" dozens of @entity42 performers , along with residents and tourists , gathered at the heart of @entity59 for the event			1
the impromptu concert included classic show tunes such as " there 's @entity77 , " " @entity78 " and " @entity79 , " and collected donations for the @entity81			1
among the attendees was theater critic and student @entity84 , who called it " a total delight " and shared several photos on @entity87			1
" everyone was so glad to get out of their apartments and gather for a communal activity , " she said			2
" the tourists and residents alike were enjoying the unexpected musical entertainment , especially since @entity42 shows have been canceled the past three days			1
" afterward , @entity36 shared his feelings about the performance on @entity50 : " we lifted our voices and lifted the spirit of @entity37 , " he wrote			1
" hey @entity37 , what 's up with the niceness ? salvaging a lifetime of memories photographer @entity106 walked through the hard - hit coastal @entity108 neighborhood of @entity110 the weekend after @entity14 made landfall , wondering how she could help			1
everywhere she looked , she saw photo albums in the debris			2
she knew she could n't replace the moments on film now sitting in piles of garbage , corroded with seawater			2
but perhaps she could help them make new memories			2
she gave her card to several families and offered them free photo sessions when they were ready			2
then she found @entity124 , a @entity125 immigrant laying out family photographs and documents in the cold air along the two stone railings leading from her front door to the sidewalk			2
inside , she had thousands more damaged photos to go through			1
her home had flooded with 6 feet of water			2
it was the perfect opportunity to help			2
@entity124 and @entity106 , who is from @entity137 , spoke easily in @entity138			2
" she told me they were all ruined , they were all gone , and i said to her , ' let me try to save them , ' " @entity106 recalled			2
" it 's almost a guilt you feel -- i have a warm home and somebody else does n't , and you just have to help			1
i knew it was n't going to be easy ... and it was n't			2
" finding joy among the wreckage @entity106 , a family photographer and an art director for a @entity58 advertising agency , took garbage bags stuffed with a lifetime of memories , including pictures from her childhood , professional photos a relative had taken and expensive albums from her son 's wedding in @entity137 last year			1
she researched photo restoration techniques on the @entity165 and spent weeks rinsing the muck - covered images and album pages under cold water and laying them to dry on paper towels			2
@entity124 , who is living without heat in her gutted home , asked @entity106 to keep the photos until she has a spot to put them			1
" these are pictures from all my life , my children , and i am very appreciative of her help , " @entity124 said			0
and @entity106 's offer of free photo sessions to families affected by @entity14 still stands			1
she can be reached through her website , 4mothersphoto.com			0
putting life 's problems in perspective for weeks , advertising photographer @entity186 sought out personal stories among the devastation left by @entity14			1
" there are plenty of volunteers , so as a photographer i decided to simply get their stories out to try to get more help for them , " he explained			1
@entity186 said the conversations helped put his life into perspective			0
" as i interviewed some of the people affected and companies trying to come back to life , i realized how each individual makes their own problem the biggest one of the moment			0
part of my motivation was to show how easy we had it , " he said			0
" four days without power or showering is not a big deal			0
losing your house is another story			0
" he spoke to several residents of @entity108 , @entity37 , including @entity218 , whose house at @entity220 was leveled by the storm even she was one of the few people on her street to board up her home			0
@entity218 told her story on camera and showed @entity186 what little remained of her property			0
@entity218 's emotions were raw as she described what it 's like to face starting your life over			1
" my husband died three years ago , we were hit with @entity237 last year , and now this			0
i 've got ta leave			0
i 'm done , " she said , her voice shaking			0
" we 've lost everything			0
i got married in this house			0
my son grew up in this house			0
" weeks later , @entity186 has been unable to reach @entity218 but is eager to follow up with her			0
in the meantime , he continues to document life in @entity220 , and sees hope			1
" what was chaos almost a month ago here in @entity220 now has gained a little sense of normalcy			1
trying to keep the family business afloat after @entity14 ' spitting rhymes ' for @entity14 relief the storm flooded @entity260 ' apartment on @entity261 in @entity262 , but he feels lucky			1
he and his roommates had time to save all their belongings as the water was coming in , and his roommate 's family welcomed him to stay in their home on the @entity270			1
it only felt right to do what he could to help others not so fortunate			0
in the weeks after @entity14 , he and his friend @entity274 -- both professional models , actors and rappers -- joined the @entity279 's relief efforts in the @entity281 beach community			1
in between jobs and castings they went to @entity281 to knock on doors , assess needs and help families remove moldy furniture			0
they wanted to find a way to help on the days they could n't physically be in @entity281 , which led them to rapping for victims			0
the friends , who had recently begun performing freestyle hip - hop on the streets for fun , set up their amp and microphone and performed raps on demand for $ 1 , with the money going to @entity14 relief efforts			1
" one time a girl said ' rap about my friend 's jeans , ' we just started going off on that			1
at @entity311 , a couple was from @entity37 in the @entity312 , and we started rapping about @entity313 ... you just kind of let your mind go , " @entity260 explained			0
so far they 've rapped in @entity59 , the @entity318 and @entity311 in @entity262 , where @entity320 and friend @entity319 found them and recorded a video			0
in three stints , the friends have raised $ 200 for the victims , including one generous $ 100 donation from a hip - hop fan who was impressed with their rhyming skills and asked to join in			0
they plan to hit the streets again this weekend and will give the money to the surf club to buy socks , blankets and other needed supplies			0
" i feel like they 're going to need more help as people start to forget and life continues as usual , " @entity260 said			0
' hard - wired to tell stories ' arriving by bus , train and plane , thousands of @entity341 from across the country canceled their church plans one sunday to help with @entity14 relief			1
one of those volunteers , @entity350 , documented the day on video			0
the @entity262 wedding photographer heard stories of loss , devastation and even some of hope from the people of @entity358 , @entity37			1
" we lost everything , but with people like you , we know everything 's going to be alright and we have faith in @entity368 , " said one woman who choked back tears as he interviewed her			1
days earlier , @entity350 joined @entity369			0
his job was ripping out dry wall from waterlogged homes			0
as he worked , he saw a " huge need " for more volunteers to help the community rebuild			0
the next time he went back to @entity358 -- that sunday -- he brought his camera along to help get the word out			0
" the day i was shooting the video , i felt a little guilty being there			0
some of my friends were there doing really intense , back - breaking work , " he said			0
" but by making the video , i felt i could persuade more people to get out there , which was the best thing i could do with my talents			0
" he accomplished his goal			0
between @entity389 and @entity87 , his video received about 270,000 views			1
" i 'm hard - wired to tell stories , " he said			1
" i thought that this was the best tool to get more people			0
" although he got his message across , @entity350 still worries			0
" people were already putting this in the rear view , and that was just two weeks after ( the storm ) , " he said			0
" now it 's been a month ... and there 's still so much more to be done out there , so i 'm hoping that it wo n't fade away			1
" @entity0 's @entity404 , @entity405 , @entity406 , @entity407 and @entity408 contributed to this story .			1
