@entity0 -- @entity5 was buried at sea from the deck of a @entity9 aircraft carrier because there was no alternative to bury him on land within the 24 hours required by @entity14 law , president @entity4 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser said monday			1
" the disposal of -- the burial of @entity5 's remains was done in strict conformance with @entity14 precepts and practices			1
it was prepared in accordance with the @entity14 requirements , " adviser @entity21 told reporters at a @entity24 briefing			1
" we early on made provisions for that type of burial and we wanted to make sure that it was going to be done , again , in strictest conformance			0
" @entity33 : burying @entity5 at sea an elegant solution the religious rites were conducted on the deck of the @entity38 in the @entity39 , with the ceremony starting at 1:10 a.m. and finishing at 2:10 a.m. et , according to a senior defense official			1
" the body was washed and placed in a white sheet			1
a military official read prepared remarks , which were then translated into @entity48 by a native speaker , the body of @entity5 was placed on a flat board , which was then tipped up , and allowed to slide into the sea , " the official said			1
planning for @entity5 's burial began months ago as part of contingency planning that took into account numerous possibilities involving the terrorist leader 's capture or death , @entity21 said			1
a senior defense official said no country was willing or able to take @entity5 's body for a funeral			1
taking the body to another country and trying to arrange a funeral would have violated the @entity14 rule requiring a burial within 24 hours , @entity21 said			2
opinion : burial at sea shows compassion of @entity14 law " there were certain steps that had to be taken because of the nature of the operation , " @entity21 said			2
" we wanted to make sure we were able to do that in the time period allotted for it			0
going to another country , making those arrangements , requirements , would have exceed that time period , in our view			0
" the descriptions of the burial appear to indicate @entity9 forces did attempt to follow @entity14 burial rules , said @entity91 , a professor of religious studies at the @entity93 in @entity94 who has studied burial rites in the @entity97 world			1
questions , however , do remain about the rites , @entity91 said			2
for one , @entity14 law requires that a @entity97 read a special funeral prayer during the ceremony			2
a @entity97 chaplain or even a rank - and - file sailor who practices @entity14 could read the prayer , he said			2
@entity9 officials ' statements do not indicate whether the native @entity48 speaker was a @entity97			0
also , an @entity14 authority would normally grant authority to bury a body at sea when a land burial is not an option			1
@entity91 said he would want to know who , if anyone , gave that authority			0
in his briefing , @entity21 said @entity9 authorities did seek guidance on the burial			0
" we consulted the appropriate specialists and experts , and there was unanimity that this would be the best way to handle that , " he said			0
that the @entity9 forces performed a ritual aboard ship instead of dumping @entity5 's body from an airborne helicopter would mute some criticism of the burial from radical muslims , @entity91 said			1
" that may temper a lot of that , " he said			0
another concern expressed by @entity9 officials was that @entity5 's grave site would become a shrine -- a practice @entity91 said @entity5 detested but nevertheless likely would have occurred			1
rep. @entity142 of @entity143 , the @entity144 chairman of the @entity145 , said burying @entity5 at sea was " prudent			2
" " he was given a proper burial			0
it removes this -- any thought that there 'll be any shrine to @entity5 or grave robbing or any other lasting impact for this death , " @entity142 said			0
@entity156 , senior adviser of the @entity157 in @entity158 , said that while the decision was not consistent with @entity97 tradition because his death " did not occur in the ocean , " the method was pragmatic			0
" i do n't think it was meant to humiliate , it was meant as an easy way out so we do n't have a tomb because there are some people who will sentimentally attach to him , and we should not apologize for that decision , " @entity156 said			0
@entity1 's @entity173 in @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
