the light bulb figuratively suspended above a human head has long been symbolic of the eureka moment that every inventor craves			1
but for @entity6 physicist @entity5 , it 's the bulb itself that provides the inspiration for his bright idea			1
@entity5 and his team at the @entity12 's @entity11 , are the brains behind a new patented technology that uses beams of flickering light to transmit digital information wirelessly , a process known as @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
" my big idea is to turn light bulbs into broadband communication devices ... so that they not only provide illumination , but an essential utility , " he says			0
@entity5 claims that data can be sent by adding a microchip to any humble led bulb , making it blink on and off at a phenomenal speed , millions of times per second			1
it 's this capability that allows @entity33 to transmit data in a rapid stream of binary code that , although invisible to the naked eye , can then be detected by a light - sensitive receiver			1
read more : ' teach young to be innovative ' " it 's a bit like sending a @entity43 signal with a torch , but at a much faster rate and using the alphabet that computers understand , " explains @entity5			1
the implication is that wherever you have a light bulb -- and there are an estimated 14 billion of them worldwide -- you have the potential for a wireless internet connection			1
in practice , it means that any street lamp could double up as a web hotspot			0
but @entity19 , or " @entity59 " as it has been nicknamed , does more than just increase @entity61 accessibility			2
the dominant technology used for wireless data transfer , @entity64 , is transmitted through radio wave signals			1
however , radio waves represent only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum and so , as demand for wireless connectivity grows , the supply of available bandwidth diminishes			0
the problem is epitomized by the frustrating experience of sitting in an @entity61 coffee shop , helplessly watching on as more and more people connect their device to the network , causing your browser speed to wither to a snail 's pace			0
the same is true for @entity84 mobile networks , which rely on an increasingly congested system of around 1.4 million cellular radio masts worldwide			2
meanwhile , the number of bytes we transmit through mobile devices is doubling every year , according to a report from networking equipment giant @entity92			0
however , @entity5 claims his technology should be a big part of the solution			2
test your knowledge of accidental inventions " the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than the radio frequency spectrum , " he explains			2
less congestion means greater bandwidth and @entity5 says transmission rates using " @entity59 " could be as high as one gigabit a second -- meaning that downloads of high - definition films could take less time than sending a text			1
for @entity5 , the beauty of his technology is that -- unlike radio wave signals that are generated from large energy - intensive cell masts -- @entity19 requires almost no new infrastructure			1
" we use what is already there , " he says			0
" the visible light spectrum is unused , it 's not regulated , and we can communicate at very high speeds			0
" but the technology has its limitations			0
@entity120 , a lecturer at the @entity121 and telematics at the @entity123 , commends @entity5 on his work but warns against overstating its potential just yet			0
watch make create innovate on @entity128 " of course one problem is that light ca n't pass through objects , so if the receiver is inadvertently blocked in any way , then the signal will immediately cut out , " @entity120 says			0
@entity135 , associate professor at @entity137 's @entity136 also foresees challenges			0
" the question is how will my mobile phone communicate back with the light source ? " @entity135 asks			0
both are valid issues , @entity5 says , but he has a simple workaround			0
" if the light signal is blocked , or when you need to use your device to send information -- you can seamlessly switch back over to radio waves			2
" @entity19 is not in competition with @entity64 , he says , it is a complimentary technology that should eventually help free up much needed space within the radio wave spectrum			1
" we still need @entity64 , we still need radio frequency cellular systems			2
you ca n't have a light bulb that provides data to a high - speed moving object or to provide data in a remote area where there are trees and walls and obstacles behind , " he says			1
although the widespread use of " @entity59 " is still some way off , it could have some useful , small scale , applications in the short term			0
for instance , @entity5 says it could transform air travel by allowing overhead cabin lights to connect mobiles and laptops in - flight ; it could also improve conditions for those working underwater -- such as people on oil rigs -- where radio waves can not penetrate ; @entity33 car lights could even alert drivers when other vehicles are too close			2
@entity5 also turns one of the technology 's perceived weaknesses -- the inability of light to penetrate through objects -- into a strength			1
" @entity59 offers a far more secure form of data transfer because it can only be intercepted by those within a line of sight of the light source , " he explains			1
" it 's a very simple electromagnetic spectrum we can see , and if that is an engine that also provides some of the fundamental needs of modern societies [ like ] high - speed data communication , would n't that be brilliant ? "			0

@entity6 inventor @entity209 has developed patented technology which uses light beams to transmit information
adding a microchip to a *normal* led light bulb makes it blink at phenomenal speed sending binary code data
@entity5 hopes his " @entity59 " networks will assist increasingly *crowded* @entity64 radio networks
