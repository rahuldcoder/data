-- @entity1 is confident that @entity2 can break @entity4 's dominance in @entity5 in his first season in charge of the nine - time @entity9 champions			1
the capital club won the last of its 31 @entity11 crowns in 2008 , but @entity1 exclusively told @entity0 that he believed he could continue the success that saw him win titles in his native @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
i did it with @entity21 , i did it with @entity22 , with @entity23 we did n't win the @entity24 but we won two consecutive premierships so , why not to do it with @entity2 ? " the 47 - year - old told @entity19 's @entity18			1
" it 's a big club , it 's a club with lots of good players			1
in this moment they have the motivation because they win nothing in the last years , but of course it 's not easy , because we have real opponents , and we have to be the team			1
" @entity1 has a big history with @entity4 , where he was an assistant coach under @entity39 and then @entity40 from 1996 - 2000			1
he had several big @entity9 clashes with the @entity43 club while in charge of @entity23 , and his @entity22 side beat @entity47 's titleholders in last season 's @entity24 semis before going on to defeat @entity51 's @entity50 in the final			1
" you know , everybody speaks about our second game in @entity4 where we had a very defensive approach			2
but they forget in the first match in the @entity24 with @entity22 we smashed them , we scored three goals and we could have scored four or five , so i think the problem with @entity4 is more psychological than other things , " @entity1 said			1
" lots of teams are afraid of them , they are afraid to attack them			0
we won it , and after that in the second leg , it 's a semifinal , it 's a @entity24 semifinal -- it 's not the moment to play the beautiful game , it 's the moment to make history			2
@entity76 completes @entity2 move " and we made history , we reached the final , and after that in the final , it was an easy match for us			2
@entity50 was a good team , but we were so solid by a psychological point of view , that @entity22 did it , and it looked like it was easy , and it was n't			2
" when @entity1 arrived in @entity83 in 2004 , he famously quipped to the @entity85 press that he was " @entity1 " -- a nickname that has stuck wherever he has gone since			2
" but you know , i won lots of things			2
i won 17 titles in the past 10 years , and i 'm one of the three coaches that won two champions @entity93 with two different teams , so , i 'm one of the good ones , " he said			1
" but to say i 'm the @entity1 , i prefer not to say that , i just say ' i have a nice system '			2
" @entity1 will have to juggle a star - studded squad which has failed to equal the sum of its parts in the past two seasons , with @entity2 's opening match away to @entity104 on august 29			1
injury blow for real star @entity105 he has brought in internationals such as @entity108 and @entity76 , but will be without @entity105 for up to four months after the @entity110 playmaker need knee surgery on his return from the @entity113 in @entity114			0
" we all know that the knee was a real problem , and after that the problem he has in the groin will be solved when the knee problem is solved , " @entity1 said			2
" and now we know until december - january we do n't have him , so we have to prepare the team , organize the team without @entity105			2
but he will be back , and he will be back at 100 percent , and at 100 percent he 's one of the best and we need him			0
" @entity124 almost single - handedly kept @entity2 in the @entity126 title race last season with his goals and inspirational performances , and @entity1 said he was looking forward to working with his compatriot -- the most expensive player in the world			1
" he 's fantastic , and the way he works speaks for itself			0
he 's a boy that works very , very hard every day -- lots of ambition , he wants to improve all the time , " @entity1 said			1
" so with the potential he has , i just hope he keeps going			0
because i can not demand more than he 's giving			0
" while @entity2 spent $ 350 million on @entity124 and other players this time last year , one position that has never been in doubt is that of goalkeeper @entity145 , who captained @entity5 to a historic first @entity113 title last month			1
he joined " @entity2 " as a nine - year - old in 1990 , and will this season pass 400 first - team appearances			1
" i believe in this club -- i 'm lucky to be @entity2 born and bred , " @entity145 told @entity0			1
" to live in the city , to play for the club , this is home for me			0
it would be hard to ever consider leaving this club			0
it has helped shape me , it 's developed me as a person on so many levels since i was so young			0
" while @entity2 's expensive squad has a reputation of being a group of talented individuals who struggle to gel , @entity145 said the players were focused on ending @entity4 's run of two consecutive titles			1
" we 're all unified as one			0
we 're hard - working , humble people			0
people who fight hard , willing to struggle for the cause			0
whether it 's @entity124 , @entity105 , @entity145 , @entity172 -- we 're all in it together , and that 's what 's important " @entity145 said @entity5 's long - awaited success was a dream come true for his generation of players			1
" what it means is so significant			0
we succeeded in realizing a dream we all had since we were young kids			0
all footballers have a dream to win the @entity113 for their country and i as a youngster was no different , " he said			0
" look at who we were up against			0
@entity191 's @entity190 , @entity192 , @entity16 , @entity193 and @entity110			0
we had to succeed against all of them ! did we ever really think we would do it given all the bad luck we 'd had in the past ? but look in the end , we were successful ! "			0
