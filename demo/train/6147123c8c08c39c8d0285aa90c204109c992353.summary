@entity23 also admitted it was difficult to deal with the restrictions her illness had placed on her attempts to return to the court			1
she has not played a competitive match since the @entity48 first round in august , but faced her younger sister in an exhibition match in november			1
" the difference is acceptance , " said @entity23 , who was part of the @entity14 team which lifted the @entity9 in 1999			1
" trying to accept how you feel and limitations			0
listening to your body and taking care of yourself			0
" instead of trying to run through a wall , just really kind of take a step back and be smart			0
i think that 's kind of what i 've learned			2
" i still have to be reminded to slow down , but hopefully there will be a day when i do n't have to be reminded of that			0
" the @entity14 team are in the second tier of the tournament for the first time after being relegated from @entity69 last year			2
@entity22 , a 13 - time grand slam winner , is looking forward to teaming up with her sister ahead of their possible pairing at the @entity74			2
" we played on the same team a few times , " said @entity22 , who was also part of the team which defeated @entity77 in 1999			2
" we always have a blast and always make the best of everything			0
" we really enjoy every moment together because we do n't sometimes get to spend a lot of time together			0
it 's something that we really enjoy			0
" the main @entity69 matches see the @entity88 begin the defense of their title away to @entity91 , while @entity11 finalist @entity92 leads last season 's runners - up @entity77 against @entity95 in @entity96			2
@entity97 , who reached the last four in 2011 , will be without @entity28 semifinalist @entity99 for the home clash with @entity101 , headed by world no. 13 @entity103			1
