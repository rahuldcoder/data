-- while the educational prospects for poor children have improved in the 50 years since i was a young boy going to @entity6 99 in the @entity7 , our country continues to needlessly lose the talents of millions of children because of a failing , entrenched public education system			2
there are no shortages of great ideas in education , both small - scale and large - scale			1
there are some brilliant teachers and educators out there in the field			0
but we have not done much more than tinker at the edges of the system			0
for that reason , we have doomed massive numbers of children -- particularly those with the misfortune to be born poor -- to academic underachievement and having no real shot at the @entity30 dream of a comfortable middle - class life			1
i believe that when large numbers of children fail academically , it is the responsibility of the adults around that child			0
the schools in my neighborhood in the @entity7 were lousy in the 1960s , and they are by and large still lousy today			2
why would n't they be ? they pretty much have not changed what they do			0
the kids are n't going to spontaneously get better by themselves			2
we , as a country , need to say " enough is enough			0
" anyone calling for reform is treated as a radical , but i think we simply need to let the science of education lead the way to real innovation and improvements			1
if the " summer melt " sets back our students academically -- particularly those in poor neighborhoods with few good summer options -- let 's extend the school year			1
if we know for a fact that the first three years of a child 's life are incredibly important for a child 's later learning , let 's give up the idea that education starts in kindergarten and train new parents and work with 0 - 3 children as early as possible			1
if you really want to be branded as a radical , suggest that we provide better health care and other services for children			1
watch @entity79 's @entity78 over the years , when i raised funds for health care for my kids , i would explain that kids with a toothache ca n't concentrate on classroom work or that a near - sighted kid without glasses may be classified as " slow " when he just ca n't see the board			1
i point out that kids need a safe , enriching environment after school , too			1
and that sports and arts programs can help a child find a focus and self - discipline that helps their academics			2
as i 've gotten older , when people push back on that kind of reasoning for wrap - around services , i just tell them i want to do it for a simple reason : i like kids			1
or i tell them i want to do it for the same reasons they do it for their kids			2
taking care of children so they can succeed in school and life should be the floor , not the ceiling , of our expectations			1
the science of evaluation and assessment also needs to be better incorporated into schools ' standard operating procedure			2
we give students standardized tests in @entity126 and math , but schools get the results in july or august ; the students and teachers have moved on , and so nothing is done with all this incredibly valuable data that we have spent a fortune obtaining			1
teachers need data about how the children are progressing in real time so they can target their efforts at where the children really are			1
we ca n't stifle innovation			0
some promising approaches will fail , but that does n't mean we should give up trying			2
we need to keep pushing until we nail what works			0
look at the world of technology : when the @entity147 crashed and burned , no one took that as a signal to stop creating handheld devices			0
as with any industry , research and development -- not to mention implementation -- takes money			0
but the cost of fixing our education system is a relative pittance			0
what have we spent in @entity160 in the past year in the name of national security ? i would say that fixing our broken education system is similarly a matter of security for our country			1
the problems of the system are most obvious in poor communities , but the problems are everywhere : we are not preparing our children for a highly competitive global marketplace of high - skill jobs			0
we are still the world 's undisputed superpower			0
when the country cares about something , we spend the money			0
@entity30 need to wake up and see this for the widespread crisis it is			0
join me in calling for a dramatic reform of our school system			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity79 .			1

@entity79 : too little progress is being made in improving schools
if summer break sets kids back , let 's try a *longer* school year , he says
give kids health care , early childhood education to make them better prepared , he says
@entity201 : schools need real - time data about student *performance*
