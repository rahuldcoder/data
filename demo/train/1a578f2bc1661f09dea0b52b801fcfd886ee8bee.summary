-- according to a report thursday , more than 600,000 @entity1 could be infected with the nasty @entity3			1
we 've already detailed how to check your @entity1 to see if you 're infected -- but that requires some command line code , and we know that not all users are comfortable doing that			1
now we 've gone one step further and wrapped those commands into two applescripts			0
why two ? well , there are actually two areas of your hard drive that need to be checked for nasty files			1
these files simply run the terminal commands and let users know if they have anything to worry about			2
they are n't the most beautiful creations , but they do the job			0
you can download the scripts here ( hosted by @entity27 )			1
after unzipping , simply double - click on " trojan - check " and " trojan - check - 2			0
" if you get an image that looks like the image at left ( click to enlarge it ) , you 're in the clear			0
if either of the scripts reports something other than " does not exist , " go to @entity37 's website and follow their removal instructions			1
even if you are n't infected , make sure you install the latest @entity40 security update for @entity41 to fix the vulnerability that allowed this nasty exploit to exist in the first place			2
did you find yourself infected ? let us know in the comments			0
