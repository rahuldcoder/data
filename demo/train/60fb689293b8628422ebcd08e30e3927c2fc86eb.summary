-- researchers managed to create embryonic stem cells through cloning , a breakthrough in the field that was announced may 15 in the journal @entity7			1
that study is now being called into question -- but not necessarily on scientific grounds			2
it appears that the study authors , led by @entity13 at @entity14 , made some errors in the graphical presentations when they submitted the manuscript			2
a commenter on the @entity20 website noticed some duplication of figures ( the data plots , graphics and images in a scientific paper ) and apparent errors in labeling			1
@entity13 acknowledged that the commenter made some valid points but told @entity30 , " the results are real , the cell lines are real , everything is real			0
" @entity34 , editor - in - chief of @entity7 , posted a statement on the study in the comments on the @entity7 website : " based on our own initial in - house assessment of issues raised and in initial discussions with the authors , it seems that there were some minor errors made by the authors when preparing the figures for initial submission			1
while we are continuing discussions with the authors , we do not believe these errors impact the scientific findings of the paper in any way			1
" the study has received several comments relating to how fast it was reviewed for publication at the journal			0
the review process is not being questioned , @entity63 said , and the paper was not considered any less thoroughly than usual despite its being published relatively quickly			0
according to @entity30 , the study was accepted three days after it was submitted , and it was published 12 days later			0
@entity14 released this statement : " in response to the issues raised in @entity20 , @entity14 has had several discussions with the journal which published the paper , @entity7			2
based on @entity14 's own initial reviews and the original assessments by @entity7 , @entity14 agrees that there were some minor errors made when preparing the figures for initial submission			1
neither @entity14 nor @entity7 editors believe these errors impact the scientific findings of the paper in any way			1
we also do not believe there was any wrongdoing			0
" the researchers are also sending more information to @entity7 , including photos and original data			2
" our shared goal is to publish a correction noting the errors and correcting the photos as soon as both @entity14 and @entity7 feel the issues are fully investigated , " the statement said			1
a @entity94 scientist in 2004 claimed to have cloned human embryonic stem cells			1
reports of @entity98 's studies attracted worldwide attention and enthusiasm from researchers and patients , but in 2006 he acknowledged faking his findings after questions of impropriety emerged			2
@entity98 was convicted in 2009 of embezzling money and illegally buying human eggs , according to state media			0
he was sentenced to a two - year prison term suspended for three years			0
here 's how the @entity14 experiment in question actually worked : normally , an embryo is created when sperm enters the egg and it starts to divide			0
but , in the @entity7 study , @entity13 and colleagues began with skin cells from an 8 - month - old baby that had a genetic disease			1
they did not use sperm			0
to create each embryo , they took the dna out of an egg so that it was hollow and replaced it with the skin cell 's dna instead			0
the baby 's dna was the only genetic material being used			0
with the help of chemicals , the egg started to divide just like a normal fertilized egg would			0
then , within several days , embryos genetically identical to the baby were created , from which stem cells were derived			1
researchers made more than 120 embryos using this method			0
embryonic stems research is inherently controversial because in order to use the stem cells for science , the embryo , which is a collection of cells that could develop into a fully formed human , is destroyed , even though embryos in these procedures are left over from in vitro fertilization			1
however , @entity13 said the embryos created in his study , from skin cells and eggs , would not grow babies			2
that would have required additional technology , and it was n't part of the study			2
cloning stem cells : what does it mean ?			1

a study about cloning stem cells *contained* errors in its presentation of graphics
the @entity7 says these errors do n't impact the scientific findings
@entity7 and the researchers want to publish a correction
