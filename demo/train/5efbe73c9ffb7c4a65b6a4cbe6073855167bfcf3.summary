making a cell phone call while aloft could become a reality under a proposal by the @entity4			1
cell phone calls , texting and other mobile services would be allowed when the aircraft are flying above 10,000 feet , but not during takeoff and landing , according to an official briefed on the proposal			1
airlines would have to equip planes with special antennas approved by the @entity15 before passengers could start talking			0
the commission says this proposal aims to give airline passengers the same communication access in the air that they have on trains and buses or in coffee shops			0
what should become of airplane mode ? " modern technologies can deliver mobile services in the air safely and reliably , and the time is right to review our outdated and restrictive rules , " @entity4 chairman @entity27 said in a statement			2
" i look forward to working closely with my colleagues , the @entity15 and the airline industry on this review of new mobile opportunities for consumers			0
" for years , the @entity4 has banned talking on mobile phones aboard aircraft in flight due to concerns that high - flying phones could disrupt cellular towers on the ground			1
a proposal to lift the cell phone ban was considered in 2004 but abandoned three years later			1
at the time , the @entity4 said that the " technical information provided ... was insufficient to determine whether in - flight use of wireless devices on aircraft could cause harmful interference to wireless networks on the ground			2
" a number of other nations around the world already allow cell phone use inflight on similarly equipped aircraft			1
@entity15 allowing most electronic device use throughout flight in a 2012 study , the @entity15 collected data from 11 countries and concluded that " civil aviation authorities reported no confirmed occurrences of cell phones affecting flight safety on aircraft with on - board cellular telephone base stations			2
" the commission is considering the proposal because passengers want it , but some surveys show passengers are split			0
in a survey conducted in 2012 by @entity79 , 64 % of passengers said the ability to make phone calls inflight would have a negative impact on their onboard experience			0
the current proposal will be discussed at the @entity4 's december 12 meeting and could then be opened for public comments			0
the commission would have to vote on a final rule before it could take effect			0
if the @entity4 gives final approval , individual airlines could choose whether to provide mobile service to passengers .			1

the @entity4 is considering allowing cell phone talk aboard aircraft
the rule would apply only above 10,000 feet
