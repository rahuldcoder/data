@entity0 , @entity1 -- the flood - swollen @entity3 was cresting at @entity0 wednesday night , hours earlier than anticipated but at a record level of 57 feet , according to the @entity6			1
" just because we 're at crest at @entity0 , or the level is starting to fall -- the water level is extra high , " said @entity7 , a senior hydrologist with the weather service 's @entity1 office			1
" residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant			1
we 're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early june , and wo n't fall below flood stage until mid to late june			1
" the river , originally forecast to crest at @entity0 thursday morning at 57.1 feet , was cresting ahead of schedule probably because an old levee system in @entity24 , @entity1 , was breached last friday and spread the flood 's flow , @entity7 said			1
he said at @entity0 the river could reach the 57.1 level as it crested -- more than 14 feet above flood stage and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927			1
the @entity33 was keeping a watchful eye on the @entity35 , which residents near @entity0 were counting on for protection			1
it is designed to keep water from backing into the @entity40			2
the backwater levee was being " armored " by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out , said @entity43 , attorney for the @entity44			2
but the @entity40 backwaters were already claiming territory and property , as @entity1 gov. @entity48 was among residents owners who watched their rising waters swallow their houses and lands wednseday			1
@entity53 , spokeswoman @entity48 's office , confirmed that a house owned by the governor in his native @entity57 was flooded by the watery onslaught moving southward down the @entity3			1
the house is on a lake in central @entity1 near the backwater - flooded @entity40			1
while areas downriver continued to brace for the growing flood , a glimmer of recovery hope flickered in one area upriver			1
authorities in @entity67 , in northern @entity1 , reopened a casino with an employee pep rally			1
" we believe that reopening our doors and putting our friends and families back to work as quickly as possible is an important step on the road to recovery , " the leaders of @entity71 said in a statement			2
casinos are a critical economic driver in the region			2
nine were closed due to the flooding of the @entity3 , said @entity84 , spokesman for the @entity85			2
three will be reopened by the weekend , he said			0
but the area still has a long road ahead before full recovery			1
residents of 300 structures under water at @entity93 are still out of their homes , said @entity95 , county spokesman			0
" the floodwaters need to recede 3 feet before they can go back , " he said			0
on saturday , the local community is holding a " @entity99 " to benefit the people of @entity93			0
@entity71 officials , in their statement , said the " near - record flooding has caused untold damage			0
" farther south , where the @entity3 has not yet crested , residents were working wednesday to clear out their homes and find ways to get by for coming weeks on higher ground			0
" we 're taking one on the chin -- not only for @entity113 but for @entity111 as well , " said @entity109 , president of @entity111 's @entity110			0
his parish is in part of the state expected to be flooded as authorities open sections of the @entity119 to help spare other areas of @entity111 , including @entity121			1
" it 's really hard when you go and visit with a family who own and operate everything they have in the area , " @entity109 said			0
" the decision has been made , and we 're just going to have to battle it			0
but we 're fighting people			0
" as of wednesday evening , 17 bays were open at @entity119 -- one more than earlier in the day -- moving water at an estimated 114,000 cubic feet per second , the @entity33 said			1
mandatory evacuations will be in effect saturday -- beginning at midnight friday -- in @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity138 , the @entity133 announced			0
by 8 a.m. saturday , " the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter , " the parish said in a news release			0
downstream in @entity144 , @entity111 , residents and officials tried to counter flooding from the rising @entity1 by stacking large containers two - and three - high around riverfront properties			1
temporary flood control barriers are protecting two medical facilities , a hotel and the city 's conference and convention center , said city spokeswoman @entity156			2
the @entity157 reopened a section of the river tuesday that it had closed to prevent damage to levees from passing barges			2
but officials said only one tow vessel at a time will be allowed to pass through the 15 - mile area near @entity144 and @entity167 , @entity1			1
and they warned they could shut the waterway again if water levels rise to 62.5 feet			0
" we will continue to closely monitor transits through the area to ensure the safety of the communities as well as the towing vessels and their crews , " @entity157 capt. @entity170 said in a statement			0
levees along the length of the river appeared to be holding , and water diverted through spillways seemed to be rising more slowly than expected , but @entity111 gov. @entity184 warned residents that plenty could go wrong			1
" there 's still an awful lot of water headed our way , and it 's going to be here in many cases for weeks , not just a few days , " @entity184 said			0
@entity111 officials earlier issued advice to residents in flood - affected areas on how to prevent snake encounters and bites			2
of the 22 species of snakes within the @entity119 , three -- the copperhead , cottonmouth and canebrake rattler -- are venomous			1
officials said the spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks , and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage , allowing those who have evacuated to return safely			1
in @entity1 , 4,937 people have been displaced by flooding so far , said @entity209 , a spokesman for the state @entity210			1
in @entity111 , more than 4,000 people have evacuated , @entity184 said , citing figures compiled by parish authorities			0
but , he said , no shelters have been opened in the state			2
by the weekend , floodwaters also are expected to peak at record levels in @entity167 as well as in @entity218 and @entity219 , @entity111 , according to the @entity6			0
the flood is the most significant to hit the lower @entity3 valley since at least 1937 and has so far affected nine states : @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity111 and @entity1			1
despite the misery and destruction , some residents in flooded areas are trying to make the best of a bad situation			2
" you know i always wanted to fish off my front porch , but i never wanted to do it this way , " former @entity241 , @entity229 , judge @entity242 told @entity2 affiliate @entity243 in @entity244 , @entity229			0
" we 've had a lot of laughs over it , but we 've had a lot of sad minutes			0
" @entity242 , who has lived in @entity250 for 66 years , said he would have never thought the water could get that high			0
while he was n't able to land a big catch , he said the fishing helps to keep his mind off the devastation			2
" it 's going to be a crying shame when the water goes down and they 're actually going to see the damage they are going to have , " @entity242 said			0
@entity2 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			0
