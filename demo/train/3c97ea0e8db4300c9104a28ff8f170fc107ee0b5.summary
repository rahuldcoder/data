-- an amusing video is posted showing an adorable 3 - year - old boy asking his mom for a cupcake with the determination of a first - year law student			1
the next thing you know , the toddler is being criticized by complete strangers			2
even worse , his mother and his father are being labeled bad parents			1
what kind of world do we live in ? answer : a bizarre one where -- in the era of @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 -- everyone thinks your business is their business			1
this is n't about privacy ; when you post content online , you give up the right to privacy			2
this is about propriety ; it 's about having manners , knowing your place , and respecting boundaries			1
just because someone posts wedding pictures does n't mean you criticize the bride 's dress			1
do you see the trouble you 've caused , little @entity43 ? the rambunctious toddler from @entity45 , @entity46 , wanted a cupcake , but his mother , @entity48 , said no. @entity43 took his case to his grandmother and asked her , in @entity51			1
his mother busted him , and -- in a video that has now been viewed more than 3 million times -- explained to the little guy why he could n't have a cupcake			1
unfazed , @entity43 continued to argue with his mother for several minutes , all the while keeping up his plea			0
" @entity60 , listen , " the boy says , occasionally also referring to his mother as " honey " and " babe			1
" i thought the video was priceless			1
my first thought was that this kid is a future politician			0
a perusal of @entity20 and @entity21 told me that many people felt the same way			1
you just do n't often see 3 - year - olds who can communicate this well			1
i also thought the video was harmless			1
but on that point , not everyone agreed			0
there have been thousands of postings , hundreds of tweets , and more than a dozen articles about the exchange between this boy and his mother			1
one round of criticism was aimed at the boy 's father , @entity85			1
while he 's not on camera , many onlookers commented that @entity43 obviously learned to argue with his mother by watching his father			1
@entity48 has since admitted that , yes , @entity43 picked up " honey " and " babe " from watching dad interact with mom			2
completely unacceptable , some people said			2
the father must be verbally abusive when speaking to his wife , they insisted with no proof to back up the claim			0
another round of criticism targeted the mother , @entity60 , for being both too lenient and too strict			0
those who thought she was too lenient thought that she should never have tolerated back - talk from a toddler , and those who considered her too strict were concerned that at one point she threatens to give her son " pow pow " ( which we understand to mean a spanking )			2
totally unacceptable , said the critics			0
up to this point , i 'm not surprised			0
it 's part of a larger trend			0
the last generation told itself , " i just want to be the best parent i can be			0
" today , the new mantra in child - rearing is cheekier : " i 'm a better parent than you			2
" critics also took issue with @entity43 himself , calling him defiant and disrespectful			0
how dare a boy talk to his mother that way ? they frowned on how @entity43 refers to his mom by her first name -- something the mother says the boy seems to reserve for special occasions like long and drawn - out pleadings where he really wants to make what he considers a very serious point			1
leafing through all the criticisms , i got depressed			0
i could n't help but think that part of the reaction was a " @entity144 thing , " where this noticeably @entity144 family ( i.e. , grandma speaks @entity51 ) was being criticized consistent with stereotypes			0
all making for a dysfunctional family			0
a stretch ? not really			0
the onlookers were jumping to conclusions about a family they knew nothing about with nothing to go on except their prejudices			2
a story that had started out being about cupcakes had taken an ugly turn that was n't at all appetizing			0
one person even suggested that , instead of watching a future politician , we were really watching a future " criminal			0
" i 've written about politics for a quarter - century			2
you do n't have to choose			0
trust me , we can have both			0
right about now , i needed a pick me up , and i got one thanks to @entity172			0
the talk show host saw the video , fell in love , and invited @entity43 and his mother onto her tv show			1
@entity172 gave @entity43 -- who loves superheroes almost as much as cupcakes -- a giant mountain of superhero - themed cupcakes			2
she gave mom a $ 10,000 check from @entity184 , one of the show 's sponsors , to help out with household expenses			1
at this point , people are laughing , and people are crying			2
and it all drowned out the petty naysayers and meddling onlookers who really should watch their manners and mind their own business			1
this story reminds us what the world needs			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

a video of a 3 - year - old boy asking his mom for a cupcake went viral
@entity207 : viewers chimed in to criticize the boy and his parents
what happened to propriety ? people need to have manners and respect boundaries
@entity207 : onlookers should mind their own business and show more empathy
