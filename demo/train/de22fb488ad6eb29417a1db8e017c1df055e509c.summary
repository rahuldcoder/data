in 2001 , my most frequently asked question has been : " what is the reason for the lack of black head football coaches in the @entity9 ? " my answers were always objective , not subjective			1
i focused on the facts			2
the numbers spoke the truth			2
today , we 're immersed in the afterglow of a remarkable seven - day collegiate football hiring span			1
from dec. 7 through 13 , three new head football coaches of color were appointed on the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) level : @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , @entity23 ( @entity24 ) and @entity25 ( @entity26 )			1
the earlier november selections of @entity28 ( @entity29 ) and @entity30 ( @entity31 ) elevated the number to five in the current 2009 @entity34 hiring cycle			2
we have 13 ( 11 african - american ) head football coaches of color among the 120 @entity34 ( @entity34 / ia ) schools			1
we are experiencing a watershed of success after a sordid history of disappointments			2
when the @entity5 released the initial report card in 2003 , the @entity34 had only three head football coaches of color			1
one year ago , only four african - americans were head coaches in the @entity34			1
it was the lowest total in 15 years			1
by the conclusion of the 2008/2009 hiring cycle , the number had risen to nine			2
@entity5 report cards revealed increases in the number of people of color brought in for official interviews , but , in reality , the hiring remained abysmal by any acceptable standard			1
anyone desiring to become a head football coach on the @entity34 level had a lesser chance statistically than those seeking to become head coach in the @entity64 or in @entity9 basketball or even a general in the @entity67			1
at the minimum , the number of minority head football coaches should be closer to 20 percent of the opportunities			1
my statement to college presidents , which accompanied the release of our most recent hiring report , called for the administrators to " stand up for justice and not block its path			2
" finally , it appears the labors of those who have so painstakingly tended to the tree of opportunity for minority football coaches have finally produced the first significant harvest of delicious fruit			1
what happened to cause the change ? no single event or group is fully responsible ; it is a collaboration of voices and actions on the issue			2
i equate it to the steady and deliberate pounding on a huge rock that finally cracks			2
while the last blow finally splits the rock to the core , all the strokes that preceded it contributed to the break			0
i believe the @entity5 has played a significant role in the exposure of the collegiate football hiring issue dating back to the late 1980s			0
the production of the annual hiring report card and distribution of capable candidate lists has brought awareness , knowledge and accountability to the search and hire process			1
dr. @entity117 ( @entity118 ) has produced multiple reports and studies pertaining to the diversity and inclusiveness of all of collegiate sports and , specifically to football			1
his call for an " @entity130 " rule on the collegiate level , similar to the @entity64 's @entity129 rule , is heard			0
the @entity129 rule requires that at least one minority candidate be interviewed when a new head coach is appointed			0
the executive office of the @entity9 , led by the strong advocacy of its late president , @entity136 , has been significant in voice and funding for this change			1
the vice president of diversity and inclusion , @entity140 , has provided successful professional development under the @entity144 ( @entity145 ) for football			1
the five recent hires are alums of the @entity144 programs			0
the strong voice of retired @entity64 head football coach @entity151 is being heard			0
when @entity151 speaks , the people listen			0
he has the resume and the platform to state the case for the equitable hiring issue			0
his expertise and credibility is unquestioned			0
coaches of color are experiencing success			1
for the first time in history , three current coaches of color will take @entity34 teams to a bowl game : @entity168 ( @entity170 / @entity169 ) , @entity173 ( @entity175 / @entity174 ) and @entity176 ( @entity172 / @entity171 )			1
two of the past three @entity179 champions have been coached by african - americans african - americans ( @entity151 and @entity181 )			1
the current success of the @entity183 with @entity184 as head coach is further testament			0
the @entity186 , led by president @entity187 , recently adopted an " @entity192 " policy to create a prescribed and appropriate standard to administer the business of intercollegiate athletics			0
specifically , the intention was to reaffirm a commitment to ethical procedures in the search and hiring process			0
the recent passage of the state of @entity201 's @entity200 was very significant			0
initially , this bill was spearheaded by the concerns of a private citizen , @entity204 , to the @entity201 legislature			0
@entity201 has adopted legislation similar to the @entity64 's @entity207 for all state colleges as a guideline for hiring in athletics			2
it appears that up to eight additional states will strongly consider similar legislation			0
finally , nothing is more significant than the positive effect of seeing the highest office in our country and , for that matter , the entire world occupied by an @entity220			0
president @entity222 's position and success as a national and world leader speaks volumes			0
most of the messages from my office have criticized a process that has progressed slowly , if not begrudgingly , toward equity			0
today , i can honestly say our college presidents and athletics directors are standing up for justice and not blocking its path			0
it 's important that we be able to continue to make this statement on a regular basis			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			1

he says after years of failure , the advocates of diversity are succeeding
@entity242 says *victories* by teams coached by african - americans have *helped*
