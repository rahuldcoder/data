the @entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 @entity4 genocide suspect @entity3 monday refused to enter a plea at his war crimes trial , demanding new lawyers and speaking over the judge until he was removed from the court			1
@entity3 , who was captured earlier this year after more than 15 years in hiding , was a combative defendant , repeatedly interrupting the @entity13 war crimes tribunal 's judge			1
" you 're not allowing me to breathe , " the former general said monday before judge @entity15 ordered him removed from the court and adjourned briefly			1
@entity15 then entered not guilty pleas to all counts against @entity3 and adjourned the hearing indefinitely			1
monday 's appearance was @entity3 's second at the @entity23 for the former @entity24			1
at his first appearance on june 3 , @entity3 dismissed as " obnoxious " charges against him			1
" i would like to receive what you 've read out just now , these obnoxious charges leveled against me , " @entity3 said , after the judge recited the charges against him			1
" i want to read this properly , to give it some proper thought together with my lawyers , because i need more than a month for these monstrous words , the ones that i 've never heard before			0
" @entity3 was the commander of @entity38 forces during the civil war in @entity5 , the bloodiest of the conflicts that accompanied @entity24 's breakup in the 1990s			1
the 69 - year - old is accused of leading a campaign of " ethnic cleansing " against @entity5 's @entity46 and @entity47 populations that included the shelling of @entity49 and the torture , abuse and rape of civilians			0
more than 200,000 @entity46 and @entity54 died in the 1992 - 95 conflict , including nearly 8,000 @entity46 men and boys slaughtered at @entity58 in 1995			0
it was @entity61 's worst massacre since @entity62 his first court appearance at the @entity0 occurred days after he was arrested after more than 15 years in hiding			1

" if you want the proceedings to proceed as they should ... i just have to say that i want to live to see that i am a free man			0
and such as i am , i am defending my country and my people and not @entity3			2
" @entity3 was taken to the @entity0 after losing his fight against extradition from @entity4			2
he was charged with genocide , crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war			0

" the suspect gave himself up without a fight may 26			0
officials located @entity3 in a village north of the @entity4 capital after culling information from his former comrades and close family members			2
it is unclear what source led investigators to the former military commander			0
the arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between @entity4 and its long - awaited entrance into the @entity116 , but the move could also usher in a political backlash from the country 's electorate , some of whom consider @entity3 a hero			2
other key fugitive war criminal suspects previously captured are @entity5 @entity4 leader @entity123 and former @entity4 president @entity124 , who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at the @entity0			0
