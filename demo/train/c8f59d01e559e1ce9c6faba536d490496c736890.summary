in a @entity2 battle that pitted the @entity3 against the operator of a small model airplane , a federal administrative judge has sided with the aircraft 's pilot			1
the judge has dismissed a proposed $ 10,000 fine against businessman @entity10 , who used a remotely operated 56 - inch foam glider to take aerial video for an advertisement for the @entity14			1
the @entity3 alleged that since @entity10 was using the aircraft for profit , he ran afoul of regulations requiring commercial operators of " @entity19 " -- sometimes called @entity19 or drones -- to obtain @entity3 authorization			1
but a judge on thursday agreed with @entity10 that the @entity3 overreached by applying regulations for aircraft to model aircraft , and said no @entity3 rule prohibited @entity10 's radio - controlled flight			1
thursday 's ruling is believed to be the first to address the issue , but it was not immediately clear whether the @entity3 would appeal , or what impact it would have on others hoping to use drones for profit			0

to date , only one operation has met these criteria , using @entity48 's @entity47 , and authorization was limited to the @entity50 , " the @entity3 's @entity44 release said			0
" there are no shades of gray in @entity3 regulations , " the @entity3 continued			0
" anyone who wants to fly an aircraft - manned or unmanned - in @entity58 airspace needs some level of @entity3 approval			0
" the @entity3 could not be reached thursday night for comment on the @entity10 ruling			1
@entity10 's attorney , @entity63 , called it " a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators			2
" " as a general matter , the decision finds that the @entity3 's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of model aircraft is not enforceable			2
it would appear to me to have a very significant impact on other operators , " @entity63 said			0
