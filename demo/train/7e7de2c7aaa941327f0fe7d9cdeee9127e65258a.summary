-- @entity1 has been @entity2 commissioner for only a few months			1
a few relatively controversy - free months			0
now -- with the longtime owner of a top team alleged to have made racist remarks in a recorded conversation posted on a celebrity - focused website -- silver is stepping down a new road			1
only one owner has been suspended in 68 years			1
that was @entity13 's @entity12 in 2000 , when the @entity13 made a secret deal with a star player to circumvent salary cap rules			2
the league has never forced an owner to give up his team			1
should @entity21 owner @entity20 face either of those punishments for the recording that @entity24 says is him talking to his girlfriend @entity25 ? first , the @entity2 says , it will investigate the matter to determine whether the recorded conversation is authentic , whether it is actually @entity20 and whether it has been edited or manipulated			1
" all members of the @entity2 family should be afforded due process and a fair opportunity to present their side of any controversy , which is why i 'm not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against @entity20 , " @entity1 told reporters saturday			1
@entity1 said the league will move " extraordinarily quickly " in its investigation and he hoped to have an initial report in " the next few days			1
" he indicated the @entity2 had been in contact with @entity20 already , saying the league 's longest - tenured owner had agreed not to travel to @entity43 , @entity44 , on sunday where the @entity21 are playing the @entity45 in the first round of the @entity2 playoffs			1
silver : ' broad powers in place ' there is no clear answer as to what the discipline should be , if the accusations against @entity56 -- who has yet to comment publicly -- are true			2
" there are broad powers in place under the @entity2 's constitution and bylaws that include a range of sanctions and all of those will be considered depending on the findings of our investigation , " @entity1 said saturday			1
according to the website @entity24 , @entity20 made the alleged discriminatory remarks during an argument he had with girlfriend @entity25 on april 9			1
@entity24 posted a 10 - minute recording of the argument online friday			2
the law firm representing @entity25 said the recording is a portion of an hourlong conversation between the couple			2
if authentic , the remarks seem to reflect @entity56 's embarrassment and frustration with @entity25 over her associating with african - americans at @entity21 games and for posting such pictures on her @entity87 account			2
" this is a failure of leadership on so many levels , " @entity88 , an @entity90 contributor and a political science professor at @entity92 , said			0
" this is not the first time we have had an owner get in trouble , and they should have had rules in place to deal with these kinds of situations			2
" the most likely penalties , said @entity0 sports anchor @entity106 , are a fine and a suspension , possibly banning the 80 - year - old @entity20 from team operations for as long as a year			2
@entity110 analyst @entity109 said there 's no question @entity1 should suspend @entity20 soon			1
" he 's got to suspend him right now , " @entity109 said saturday night			0
" first of all , they have to prove it is his voice on the tape , but this is the first big test of @entity1			0
you ca n't have this guy making statements like that			0
he has to suspend him and fine him immediately			0
" @entity20 has never been sanctioned by the league since he bought the team in 1981			1
other owners have been fined , most notably @entity127 owner @entity126 , who has paid out nearly $ 2 million in 19 fines , according to @entity129			0
one fine reportedly was $ 500,000 , about the same amount @entity132 owner @entity131 supposedly had to pay in 2011			2
but those were for remarks about officiating ( @entity136 ) and the lockout ( @entity131 )			0
and a similar record - level fine for the @entity21 owner might not seem like much to the public , since @entity20 is worth billions			1
the league probably can not force @entity56 to give up the team , which according to @entity143 is worth $ 575 million , @entity106 said			0
according to @entity106 , the @entity2 constitution is confidential , and reportedly the league would only step in to remove an owner if the team were in financial trouble			1
a team on the rise the value of the @entity21 , who were a terrible team for decades , has been on the rise with their recent success on the court			0
led by all - stars @entity158 and @entity160 , who is also the head of the players union , the team has set win records in the past two seasons			0
the other players will look to @entity160 for guidance , but a players walkout is unlikely			0
" they are looking at @entity160 and they are trying to see what can they actually do to show their disdain and dislike ( for @entity56 ) , " @entity88 said			0
the @entity2 will face an image problem if @entity20 turns out to be the voice on the recording , in which a man tells a woman that she should n't be seen at @entity21 games with @entity179 because he is @entity180			1
the question would become : could the @entity21 sign any free agents in the offseason if @entity20 remains the owner ? @entity185 , who could potentially be one of those free agents , indicated he would n't consider playing for @entity20 's @entity21			1
" there 's no room for @entity20 in the @entity2 , " he said saturday before the @entity132 played the @entity186			1
" there is no room for him			0
" @entity185 told @entity191 he was certain @entity1 would take care of the matter			0
@entity88 said @entity1 needs to be forceful			0
" he can say , ' look , you have damaged the brand			0
you have damaged the league , and consequently , i think we are going to have to look at your right to own this team , ' " @entity88 said			0
@entity20 has faced questions tied to racial issues in the past			2
in 2009 he settled -- while admitting no liability -- three lawsuits tied to discrimination claims at apartments he owned in @entity211 , the @entity205 reported			0
he also settled a 2003 lawsuit that claimed he would n't rent to @entity213 , the @entity205 reported			0
@entity20 was sued in 2009 by former @entity21 general manager @entity214 , who said he was a victim of age and racial discrimination			2
@entity217 dropped the race claim and a jury ruled in @entity20 's favor			1
@entity1 said saturday that @entity20 's past " has n't so far " played into the investigation			1
" we 're very focused on the audio tape ... and the facts around it			0
" the @entity2 playoffs will continue through mid-june , when the league will crown a champion .			1

@entity20 has never been disciplined by the @entity2
only one owner of any of the league 's 32 teams has ever been suspended
new @entity2 commissioner says league will conduct a quick investigation
@entity20 has n't commented publicly on recording of racist remarks supposedly by him
