-- in the @entity2 , controlled violence is , and always will be , an essential part of the sport			1
as fans , we have no problem with coaches telling players to run hard , hit hard and tackle hard , because we know that we ca n't take that kind of contact and tough physicality out of football			1
however , as a long - time fan of the @entity2 , when i heard the audio of former @entity18 defensive coordinator @entity17 instructing his team to injure members of the @entity21 before their playoff game in january , i was really bothered			1
@entity17 explicitly commanded his defense to target particular players with the intent of injuring them and taking them out of the game			1
talking about 49ers star running back @entity29 , @entity17 said , " we 've got to do everything in the world to make sure we kill @entity29 's head			0
we want him running sideways			0
we want his head sideways			0
" @entity17 coached his players to take out the knees of the 49ers no. 1 receiver , @entity36			2
" we need to decide whether @entity36 wants to be a fake - ass prima donna , or he wants to be a tough guy			0
we need to find out			0
he becomes human when we ( expletive ) take out that outside @entity46 , " @entity17 said , referring to the anterior cruciate ligament , one of the major ligaments in the knee , which when torn or injured can end a player 's season			0
another 49ers receiver , @entity47 , entered the game recovering from a concussion and @entity17 told his players , " we need to find out in the first two series of the game , that little wide receiver , no. 10 , about his concussion			1
we need to ( expletive ) put a lick on him right now			0
" the difference between @entity17 ' comments and typical football coaching rhetoric , which can be almost as coarse , is that the violence is personalized			0
as @entity60 wrote , it gives " to airy nothingness a local habitation and a name			0
" @entity17 was not just talking about tackling ; he targeted specific players and specific parts of their bodies			2
his intent was to hurt 49ers players , rather than to stop them			0
this may be a subtle distinction , but it is a real one			0
and such distinctions determine whether the game of football is played within or outside the rules			0
the @entity17 audio makes the seriousness of the @entity2 's bounty scandal very real			1
@entity2 commissioner @entity79 has made it clear that the @entity2 will not tolerate this type of violence or any bounty systems			1
his indefinite suspension of @entity17 and separate suspensions and punishments levied on the @entity18 were meant to send a loud and clear message to the rest of the league as well as fans of the sport that the @entity2 takes this issue seriously			1
on monday , @entity79 stood tough and rejected the @entity18 ' appeal and upheld the season - long suspension of @entity18 coach @entity95 and two other team executives			1
the @entity2 's tough response leads us to wonder how it will respond to another violence - related problem threatening the league : the growing concussion - driven @entity102 epidemic			1
in 2009 , a study commissioned by the @entity2 reported that former players between the ages of 30 and 49 were 19 times more likely to be diagnosed with severe memory - related diseases than an average person			1
today 's coaches , trainers , and players are much more aware of the severity of head trauma than those of a decade ago , but some say it 's too little too late			0
@entity117 , the successful @entity2 quarterback of the late 1980s and early 1990s , recently admitted that , because of multiple concussions , his " memory 's pretty much gone			1
there are a lot of times when i walk into a room and forget why i walked in there			0
" @entity125 running back @entity126 was one of the most recent players to join more than 300 former @entity2 players in suing the @entity2 for negligence in their handling of concussions and other injuries			1
@entity126 , who is also battling memory loss , says that the league should have done more to warn players about the consequences of head trauma			0
the problem does n't fall solely on the shoulders of the @entity2			2
scientific evidence is clear that concussions have devastating effects on our youngest athletes			2
teenagers with multiple concussions can exhibit memory loss , amnesia and significantly lower grade - point averages than teenagers without head injuries			2
by the time they reach the @entity2 , these young adults can be one or two concussions away from serious brain damage			1
the @entity2 is a valuable institution that has done much good for our youth and @entity79 has done a fine , exemplary job so far			1
he sent a strong , clear message to @entity17 and the @entity18 that illegal forms of contact and violence within the sport will not be permitted			2
let 's hope he handles the concussion problem with similar clarity , and continues to protect players while maintaining the physicality and integrity of the sport			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity2 commissioner @entity79 turns down appeals of bounty punishments
@entity18 coordinator had told players to target *opponents* for specific injuries
@entity185 says such *behavior* goes way beyond the normal physicality of football
he says @entity79 needs to respond to the evidence of harm from concussions in football
