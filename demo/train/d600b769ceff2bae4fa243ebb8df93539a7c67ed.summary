-- how do you go back to work when one of your colleagues has been seriously injured ? that is the reality facing the field of @entity8 drivers just days after @entity10 racer @entity9 suffered a potentially devastating type of brain injury at the @entity14 @entity13			1
" it 's principally business as usual , " @entity15 , who raced in the sport 's attritional era of the 1970s and 80s , told @entity0			1
" but it will affect some more than others			0
" today 's generation of drivers have never seen what they had to deal with on sunday			1
it will make them realize that they are no longer infallible			0
" @entity9 underwent surgery sunday at @entity31 and remains in a critical but stable condition , his family said in a statement tuesday			1
the 25 - year - old 's @entity35 car collided with a recovery vehicle as heavy rain sent slick rivers down the demanding @entity40			1
the race was red - flagged soon afterwards , a few laps short of the race distance , with @entity43 declared winner			2
as the drivers climbed out of the cars , they were met by grim - faced team members explaining that one of their number was injured			1
there were muted celebrations on the podium for @entity43 , his @entity57 teammate @entity56 and @entity59 's @entity58 ; the champagne stayed on ice			2
@entity62 's @entity61 gave an insight into the brooding preoccupation the accident brought him , writing on @entity66 sunday night : " @entity67 to sleep ... # @entity68			2
" this experienced band and their peers will climb back into the cockpits and resume racing at this week 's inaugural @entity72 @entity13 while @entity9 continues his personal fight in @entity14			1
he faced the queasy dilemma of driving in the 1994 @entity76 after his teammate @entity77 had been killed in qualifying the day before			0
the @entity79 , son of three - time world champion @entity80 , decided he would compete in the fateful @entity82 race that would also take the life of @entity85 hero @entity84			2
" when an accident like that happens it hits you like a bolt of lightning , " @entity74 told @entity0			1
" i made a decision to race because i said ' we have to keep the show on the road			0
' i knew @entity77 well enough to know he would have said ' if it 's safe get out there			2
' " we raced for him as well , and it was the only way i could pick the team up to continue what we had to do			0
" dancing with danger is part of the job description for each and every racing driver			2
last week 's race at @entity40 was , however , made more complex by rain swirling around the incoming @entity108			2
when the race began at 3pm local time , the field completed two opening laps behind the safety car before being called back to the pit lane to wait until track conditions improved			0
the race restarted after a 20 - minute delay and @entity9 's accident came as more heavy rain coincided with fading day light as the race reached its climax			1
the events stirred echoes of the @entity125 when @entity126 effectively handed the world title to rival @entity128 by choosing not to race as a deluge swamped the @entity131 circuit			0
@entity126 , now a guiding voice for the @entity57 drivers as the team 's non-executive chairman , argued his life was worth more than the world title			1
in contrast , @entity15 , racing for the @entity140 - @entity139 team , was one of the drivers who decided to drive despite the dangers			1
i had no problem , " @entity15 recalls			1
" the conditions were diabolical all through sunday			0
" at @entity131 , when we started the race , the track conditions were very bad probably every bit as bad , if not worse , than @entity40			0
" @entity14 has a different attitude to the role of a sportsman , you 're a samurai in a way to the @entity14 public			1
" there was a championship to be decided , @entity8 was just beginning to make a global footprint in terms of television			1
" but it 's what you do			0
we just started the race and got on with it			0
in a sense that was our job			0
" every driver has a right to say no and not compete but if you said that individually , as @entity126 and others did in @entity131 , in some quarters that would be considered : ' are you a racing driver or are you a racing driver ? ' " an intrinsic element of fearless machismo may well help drive today 's racers as they line up on the grid for the @entity181			2
the @entity182 , built around the @entity183 on the @entity185 coast , will present a fresh and completely different challenge but there will be inevitable distractions from @entity40			0
" it 's not easy , " says @entity74			1
" when they go to @entity72 to race there will be a lingering thought about the accident			2
" i know from my experience in 1994 how difficult it can be			0
you still do your job but there 's a little bit of edge that could be missing			0
" the minds in @entity8 wo n't be as clear as they normally are			2
" it has been 20 years since the sport 's last fatalities when @entity84 and @entity77 lost their lives in consecutive days at @entity82			2
that dark weekend prompted a sea change in @entity8 's safety standards , a process which is ongoing			1
helmet safety improved with @entity211 and @entity212 ( @entity213 ) devices made obligatory while run - off areas at the tracks were increased and many corners were modified to reduce g - forces , for example			0
but @entity15 argues such vast improvements in safety have dulled the fear factor of today 's @entity8 heroes			1
" in our day it was an occupational hazard , " says @entity15 of facing the reality of a potentially fatal accident			2
" we never knew one day or the next if we would be a victim or just roll on to the next race			0
" because of the incredible safety improvements , the ferocity of some of the accidents in contrast to the lack of fatality and serious injury is incredible			0
" today 's generation have seen massive accidents and the driver is able to walk away and return to his car for the next race			1
" the side effect of this is that it 's created a sense of indestructibility in the minds of some of the drivers , if not all of them			2
" they 've got such good safety facilities and car safety			0
so they feel , not bulletproof but as close to that as you can become			0
" @entity9 's accident has proved that may no longer be the case and that reality may still be being absorbed by the drivers			1
@entity262 , the last @entity8 racer to suffer a serious injury when he fractured his skull during the 2009 @entity265 gp weekend , visited the @entity31 after the race on sunday			1
before he left the circuit , the @entity268 driver said he had been " screaming on the radio ... that there was too much water on the track			0
" the drivers will gather together in @entity183 for their usual pre-event meeting and @entity9 's accident will surely be high on the agenda			1
the @entity277 said it has also started its own investigation into the incident			0
" the drivers ' concerns are going to be raised by the @entity282 and they will want answers as much as the @entity277 do , " @entity15 explains			1
" it will be analyzed beyond navel gazing because it is a serious issue to understand what occurred			0
" was there fault with any of the parties ? were the protocols strictly observed ? did someone not respect the protocols ? that applies to @entity9 as much as it does to the corner workers retrieving the car and the flag marshals			2
" there is another cold reality in @entity72 -- the wheels of @entity8 will continue to roll			1
less than 24 hours after @entity9 's accident , photos appeared and statuses changed on social media as the @entity8 community arrived in @entity72 for the next race			1
@entity35 has asked for " patience and understanding " as it copes with the fallout of @entity9 's accident			1
the team , which has @entity72 backers , is yet to announce if it will run a replacement for @entity9 in sunday 's race			1
" be under no misunderstanding , i imagine @entity35 's phone was ringing off the hook with drivers with budgets wanting to drive that car this weekend , " comments @entity15			1
" it 's a reality of life			0
" as sad as this is for @entity9 , a fine young man , who in my view probably did n't do anything wrong			2
" he 's there fighting for his life and the team have to get on with the job of running two cars on sunday			0
" @entity74 , who combines racing with a long - term plan to bring the famous @entity74 marque back to motorsport , is philosophical about what will drive @entity8 and its main protagonists this weekend			1
" life either gives you pain when you think about something or it does n't , " he says			0
" there is always a respect of the risk involved [ in racing ] but you have to be firm in your mind about what it is you 're trying to achieve			0
" things happen for reasons that sometimes you do n't understand , yet there are many things to learn from those experiences			0
" watch : racing through the @entity182			0
