-- in the brief history of web sites , there are few if any second chances			1
remember @entity5 ? experts say @entity7 should focus on music to stage a comeback			1
here , @entity10 performs at a @entity7 event			1
that 's why it 's difficult for some industry observers to see a comeback for @entity7 , the large online social network that has seen its popularity flatline and its hipness surpassed by younger sites like @entity20 and @entity21 in recent months			1
" if you look back at the first era of the @entity29 , there are a bunch of companies that did n't survive that -- the search sites like @entity34 and @entity35 , " said @entity22 , founder and editor of @entity24 , a technology news site			1
" i guess you could say @entity7 is in danger of falling into the same black hole those companies did			2
" he added : " if you look at the history , @entity7 is going to disappear over time			2
" @entity22 and others said it is possible but unlikely that @entity7 will buck the @entity29 's high turnover rate			1
if successful , a reborn @entity7 would prove something new : that it 's possible for a big - name web site to recover from a slump			1
there are some signs that @entity7 is trying to reinvent itself			2
in april , @entity7 hired a new chief executive , @entity50 , who comes from a background in online music and is expected to help the social network beef up its strong presence in the entertainment community			1
@entity50 joined @entity7 after a stint at @entity57 , a music site , and after working as an executive at @entity21			1
he takes the helm at @entity7 at a time when the site is looking stale compared with its newer competitors			1
@entity21 unseated @entity7 as the most popular online social network worldwide in the spring of last year , according to @entity65 , a research firm			2
at the end of 2008 , @entity21 had about 220 million visitors worldwide , compared with @entity7 's 125 million , @entity65 says			1
@entity7 's popularity appears to have plateaued , while @entity21 's continues to increase			1
@entity50 , who declined an interview request from @entity0 , said at a recent technology convention that innovation could put @entity7 back on top			2
" clearly , we 're not the darling of the press right now , but the great thing about the @entity79 is that you have the opportunity to innovate and disrupt that narrative if you can deliver on these innovation promises , " he said at @entity74 's d : @entity85 conference			0
@entity50 did not say what those changes might be			0
@entity7 needs to " figure out what their secret sauce is going to be " in order to survive , said @entity92 , editor in chief of @entity94 , a news site focused on technology			1
he added that the site should n't be discounted entirely because it remains " huge by any standards			0
" @entity92 said @entity7 is an example of how corporate ownership slows innovation , which spells death in the fast - moving realm of internet technology			1
@entity7 's innovative spirit largely died when @entity106 bought the site in 2005 , he said			1
this left room for @entity21 to come up with new ideas and plot a takeover			0
" if you look at @entity7 , it really peaked a few months after @entity106 acquired it , " he said			2
" @entity106 really came in and focused heavily on monetization [ of the site ] , but perhaps , in retrospect , it was really at the sacrifice of growing the community			0
" the site should capitalize on what makes it different from other sites : its music player , said @entity125 , a writer at @entity126 , a technology news site			1
but that still may not be enough for @entity7 to rebound , he said			2
" the web , and technology in general , are both about what - have - you - done - for - me - lately , " @entity125 said			2
when any kind of site becomes super-popular , they maybe just kind of rest on their laurels , and they 're content to keep their user base ... and then a site comes along and does something like a platform for third - party developers , like @entity21 did , and then it kind of turns the market on its side			2
" to stage a comeback , @entity7 would have to create something " completely outside of the box , " he said			2
ireport.com : can websites like @entity7 make a comeback ? the problem is n't necessarily with @entity7 as much as it is with the nature of online social network users today , said @entity158 , vice president of media analytics for @entity160 , a research firm			0
web users are fickle , he said			0
" it seems that social networks are incredibly portable , meaning that me and my friends can go from @entity7 to @entity21 to @entity20 without blinking much , " he said			0
history proves this point , he said , adding that no site has been able to successfully recover from a substantial loss of popularity			0
the life cycle of social networks , which appears to be shortening , is perhaps less than two years now , @entity158 added			0
" @entity21 , as sort of an important thing in people 's lives , is probably a year and a half old			0
and people are already out there saying , ' well , @entity21 's pass√© , and @entity20 is the thing to do now			0
and before that , it seemed like @entity7 had maybe a two - and - a - half - year window , " he said			1
@entity7 may become a niche network that 's focused on its users ' interests in music and entertainment , he said			1
the site also could follow the lead of @entity5 and find popularity outside the @entity190 , said @entity125 , of @entity126			1
" i think that is a decent play to keep yourself alive , " he said			0
@entity5 , once the most popular online social network in the @entity190 , fell off the map here but now is among the hottest web sites in @entity197			1
the company moved its headquarters from @entity200 , @entity201 , to @entity202 , @entity203 , as a symbol of the shift			0
@entity7 also faces a demographics problem			0
its users tend to be younger than @entity21 's and therefore have potentially less value in the eyes of advertisers , said @entity211 , spokesman for @entity212 , a research company			0
international users also are harder to make money from , @entity125 said			0
@entity158 , of @entity160 , said there always will be new online social networks to challenge the old guard			0
the newest player is @entity20 , a micro-blogging site where users post 140 - character messages			0
" we have already begun to hear rumbles that @entity21 is beginning to wane and we all should be @entity224 , " he said			0
and soon , @entity158 said , technology will evolve to the point where it leaves @entity7 , @entity21 or @entity20 behind .			0

web sites get few if any second chances at success
experts say @entity7 has fallen out of favor and will be hard - pressed to recover
the site could follow @entity5 's lead and go international
or it could focus on its roots in music
