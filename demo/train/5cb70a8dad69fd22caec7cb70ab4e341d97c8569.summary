@entity0 -- dr. @entity3 's lawyers began presenting the defense case monday , calling a doctor who testified that @entity6 asked him for an intravenous anesthetic to help him sleep two months before his death			1
a nurse , who began her testimony late monday , is expected to testify tuesday that @entity6 asked her , also two months before he died , for @entity11 of the surgical anesthetic propofol			1
the prosecution rested its case in the involuntary manslaughter trial of @entity6 's doctor monday morning with the conclusion of testimony by its anesthesiology expert			1
defense lawyers will use the next three or four days to challenge the prosecution 's contention that dr. @entity3 's alleged reckless use of propofol to help @entity6 sleep makes him criminally responsible for the pop icon 's death			1
a @entity0 doctor who treated @entity6 off and on for about two decades for " his profound sleep disorder " testified that @entity6 called him to his home to ask for help about two months before his death			1
dr. @entity33 testified that @entity6 asked him for " intravenous sleep medicine , " but he did not specifically name a drug			1
" i think he used the word juice , " he said			0
@entity6 told him he needed an anesthetic delivered by @entity38 because " he did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful , " @entity33 said			1
@entity33 said that despite @entity6 's request , he only gave him a prescription for two oral sedatives to help him sleep			1
the defense called @entity33 in an apparent effort to show @entity6 was seeking -- and getting drugs -- from other doctors at the same time dr. @entity3 was working as his full - time physician			1
the judge stopped the defense from asking @entity33 questions about @entity6 's visits to dr. @entity54 , the dermatologist who gave @entity56 injections during frequent visits to his @entity59 clinic in the months before his death			1
deputy district attorney @entity61 used the defense witness to make the prosecution 's point that using propofol outside a clinical setting is unacceptable			1
" is there any amount of money that would have convinced you to give him intervenous propofol in his house ? " @entity61 asked @entity33			1
" absolutely not , " @entity33 answered			2
the defense then called @entity75 , a nurse who practices nutrition and natural remedies , who testified that she worked with @entity6 to help his fatigue and insomnia from february through april of 2009			1
after two months of using iv infusions of vitamins , " sophisticated " vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas , @entity6 began asking for more help , @entity81 testified			2
" his complaint was ' i have a problem sleeping and all the natural remedies and everything you 're doing is not working , ' " she said			0
" when i need sleep , i need to go to sleep right away			0
" the court session ended just before defense lawyer @entity96 could ask @entity81 to describe what kind of help @entity6 was asking for , but the nurse previously told @entity1 that he requested propofol			1
" i told him this medication is not safe , " @entity81 told @entity1 on june 30 , 2009			0
" he said , ' i just want to get some sleep			0
i just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep			0
' " closing arguments could come as soon as friday , depending on the length of the defense 's case and the prosecution 's rebuttal , but they could be pushed to next monday , based on comments by lawyers and the judge			1
@entity116 canceled shows in @entity118 to be with her family in @entity0 for the final days of @entity3 's trial , but she did not arrive home in time to attend monday morning 's session			2
she sat with her parents and several siblings during the first five days of the trial , but she has not been at court in nearly three weeks			0
" after talking with my family last night , i decided we must be together right now , " she said in a statement posted sunday on her website , announcing that three shows this week in @entity130 are canceled			0
the concert promoter told @entity6 fans it was " important that @entity116 is with her family at this critical point in the hearing			1
" @entity138 will travel to @entity139 next weekend to fulfill a commitment to attend the premiere of " @entity6 : life of an icon , " a documentary about her son , an aide to @entity6 said monday			1
she agreed to the trip before it was known the trial could last into next week , @entity146 said			2
the first three defense witnesses , called in rapid order monday morning , were all police officers			2
a @entity59 police officer , the first defense witness , testified that a 911 call routed through her department at 12:20 p.m. on june 25 , 2009 , asked for help at @entity6 's @entity158 estate			1
a @entity0 police officer testified next about retrieving seven minutes of video from a security camera at @entity6 's home			2
the video , shown to the jury , captured @entity6 's arrival home from his last rehearsal just before 1 a.m. on the morning he died			2
@entity6 fans sitting in court appeared to become emotional as they viewed the last video ever recorded of the pop icon alive , grainy security camera video of @entity6 arriving home from his last rehearsal			0
@entity3 's lawyers have said they plan to call about 15 witnesses , including three medical experts and several of @entity3 's patients from his clinics in @entity179 , @entity180 , and @entity181			0
two other @entity183 investigators were called to the stand by the defense monday and testified briefly			0
@entity186 , the head of @entity186 , is also expected to called by the defense			0
@entity3 's lawyers have argued that @entity6 was pressured by @entity186 , whose company was promoting his comeback concerts in @entity139 , to show up healthy and on time for rehearsals or else the tour might be canceled			0
@entity3 told detectives @entity6 begged for his " milk , " his nickname for propofol , after a sleepless night and just hours before he died from what the coroner has said was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic			1
@entity3 , in a police interview , said he was using sedatives to wean @entity146 from propofol , which he had used almost every night for two months to fight his insomnia			0
but after a long , restless night and morning , the lorazepam and midazolam had no effect , @entity3 said			0
" i 've got to sleep , dr. @entity3 , " @entity3 said @entity6 pleaded to him			1
" i have these rehearsals to perform			0
i must be ready for the show in @entity211			0
tomorrow , i will have to cancel my performance , because you know i can not function if i do n't get to sleep			0
" @entity3 said he gave in to @entity6 's pleas and gave him an injection of 25 milligrams of propofol around 10:40 a.m. the testimony of anesthesiologist expert dr. @entity219 , concluded monday morning , 11 days after he took the stand as the prosecution 's 33rd , but perhaps most important , witness			1
@entity219 testified last week that there was no way @entity6 got only the amount of propofol @entity3 said he did , based on the high level of the drug found in blood taken during his autopsy			1
the " only scenario " to explain @entity6 's death was that he overdosed on propofol infused through an iv drip set up by @entity3 , @entity219 said			1
the @entity236 coroner ruled that @entity6 's death was a homicide , the result of " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with sedatives			2
the defense contends @entity6 self - administered the fatal dose , along with sedatives , without @entity3 knowing			2
@entity219 said the level of propofol in @entity6 's blood taken during his autopsy could not have been from either @entity3 or @entity6 injecting the drug , but only from an iv system that was still flowing when his heart stopped			2
prosecutors , however , opened the door for one scenario in which @entity6 , not @entity3 , could have triggered the overdose			0
" can you rule out the possibility that @entity6 manipulated something to cause it to flow ? " deputy district attorney @entity61 asked friday			2
" that 's a possibility , " @entity219 said			0
but that is assuming @entity3 set up the drip and left @entity6 's side , he said			0
would @entity219 's opinion that @entity3 was responsible for @entity6 's death change if he knew @entity6 turned the drip on ? " no , if @entity6 had reached up , seen the roller clamp and opened it himself , this is a foreseeable consequence of setting up an essentially dangerous way of giving drugs , " @entity219 said			0
" it does n't change things at all			0
it would still be considered abandonment			0

new : @entity6 asked for " intravenous sleep medicine , " dr. @entity33 says
