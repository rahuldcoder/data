-- snowflakes are piling up at many major @entity3 ski areas , and many of you are anxiously pulling your gear out of storage in preparation to hit the slopes			1
in anticipation of the march to the mountains , we thought you might like to know what 's new at select lodgings in some of @entity3 's favorite ski destinations			2
it 's obvious they 're going all out to make your trip to the slopes one to remember			2
we start our journey in @entity23 with a brand new property , the @entity25 ( from $ 89/night ) , a friendly 50 - room retreat that opened earlier this year in the heart of the @entity28			2
a haven for outdoor enthusiasts throughout the year , not just ski season , it 's less than a five - minute stroll from the lake and the @entity35			1
while @entity38 's design could be called whimsical and woodsy , it includes creature comforts like 300 - thread - count sheets , flat - screen tvs and in - room gear racks for all your stuff			2
envisioned as a place for like - minded people to meet and share experiences , its public areas are the ones that really shine , though , from the communal dining table to the rooftop hot tub to the dual fire pits for roasting s'mores			2
also new is the @entity55 ( from $ 436/night ) , a stunning conversion in historic @entity57 , @entity58			2
technically , it was open for part of last year 's ski season , but given its late arrival , the schoolhouse turned chic ski lodging did n't get the attention it deserves			1
in a limestone structure dating back to 1889 , what were once classrooms -- and the principal 's office -- have been transformed into inviting accommodations boasting hardwood floors , luxe fabrics and imported antiques			0
@entity76 s ski , sip cocktails in the cozy lounge or take a dip in the heated pool built into the aspen - covered hillside			0
@entity83 's ski towns have updates galore to gab about			1
in @entity87 alone , you 've got renovations at two notable properties			1
when it reopens this week , the prestigious @entity90 ( from $ 388/night ) will reveal a brand new look to everything from its lobby and atrium to its 93 guestrooms and suites			1
it will also unveil , for the first time in its 125 - year history , its very own spa , a milestone that is no doubt music to the ears of guests who spend all day schussing down the mountainside			0
the recently reopened @entity87 ( from $ 329/night ) , has been refashioned with a $ 43 million makeover to be more in keeping with the grand mountain manor style @entity108 founder @entity107 envisioned for the brand oh so many years ago			1
not only has the interior been totally upgraded , but the hotel also has recently introduced a new restaurant concept in partnership with @entity114			0
called @entity116 , it features an open kitchen , a chef 's table and a menu overseen by a group of culinary artists dubbed by @entity114 as the country 's " @entity123			0
" in nearby @entity126 , the former @entity125 has been overhauled and relaunched as the @entity127 ( from $ 89/night ) , complete with all of @entity129 's signature programs and amenities , including those dreamy @entity131 that are so comfy you almost do n't want to get out from under the covers			0
but you will , knowing that the hotel offers ski - in / ski - out access , along with its own ski concierge			0
follow the @entity138 up north to @entity139 , @entity140 , near the entrance to @entity142 , and you 'll find the quaint @entity144 ( from $ 89/night )			1
we bring up this family - owned retreat not just for its proximity to a wealth of backcountry runs and trails , but also to appease those of you looking for something a little different in your snow - centered stay -- namely , a host of old rail cars that have been converted into unique sleeping quarters , including two new cabooses recently transplanted to the site			1
the refurbished @entity162 , which sleeps six , and the @entity164 @entity163 , which sleeps four , both offer luxury accommodations boasting full kitchens , gas fireplaces and commanding views of the surrounding forest			0
this is also a spot for anyone who wants to get away from it all ; with the exception of one rail car , there are no @entity176 here and you ca n't get cellphone service , although they do have pay phones and complimentary @entity182 access for guests in the @entity184			1
ski aficionados on the @entity186 are in for a treat now that the 234 - room @entity189 on @entity190 ( from $ 136/night ) , located in @entity193 's @entity192 region just two hours from @entity188 , has finally completed the $ 9 million upgrade it began in 2007			0
the ski - in / ski - out hotel and spa sports everything from new carpeting and temperature controls to updated wallpaper and kitchen appliances			0
general manager @entity201 brags that the redo has produced " a fresh look to rival the grandeur of our setting			0

the @entity90 in @entity87 , @entity83 , reopens in *mid-december*
