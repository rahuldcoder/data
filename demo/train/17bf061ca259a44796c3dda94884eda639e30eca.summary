@entity0 -- the super pac backed by the @entity4 brothers is making its final push in @entity6 on thursday with a seven figure ad buy urging voters to keep independent candidate @entity9 out of the @entity10			1
@entity9 has remained tight - lipped on which party he would caucus with if elected , but the @entity4 - backed super pac is funneling more than $ 1.1 million into @entity6 airwaves to make sure @entity9 does n't get the chance to cast the deciding vote for @entity10 control			1
@entity17 , the sole super pac in the @entity3 ' vast network of political groups , is launching two tv ads in @entity6 that link @entity9 to president @entity21 and @entity10 majority leader @entity22			1
the ads will run through @entity24			0
" the future of @entity6 , of our country could depend on you , " the narrator says in one ad			0
" @entity6 can stop @entity22 and @entity21 's failed policies			0
how ? do n't vote for @entity9			2
" recent polls show @entity9 is neck - and - neck with incumbent @entity35 sen. @entity34 in one of the most watched @entity10 races this cycle			1
and after @entity39 pulled their candidate to boost @entity9 's chances of unseating @entity34 , @entity35 have made every attempt to paint @entity9 as a @entity43 - in - disguise			1
it 's a strategy the @entity4 - backed group has also adopted , dropping $ 6.5 million of ads in six other battleground @entity10 races to paint a vote for @entity39 @entity10 candidates as a vote for @entity21			1
the pair of @entity6 ads might be the group 's final push , but it 's not their first			2
the super pac threw $ 500,000 worth of tv time last month with the same strategy of linking @entity9 to @entity21			1
@entity9 and @entity34 are tied at 46 % of support , according to a @entity62 poll released monday			0
a @entity1 / @entity64 poll earlier this month also judged the race a statistical tie , with @entity34 leading by just one point with 49 %			0
@entity9 is just one of the candidates this year who could shake things up in the @entity10			0
in @entity70 , former sen. and now - independent @entity72 is a top contender in a competitive three - man race -- and there 's also a chance he could caucus with @entity39			2
and in @entity78 , a separate @entity4 - backed group is on the airwaves with an ad supporting libertarian candidate @entity81 in a ploy clearly aimed at siphoning liberal votes away from @entity39 sen. @entity84			1
" [ @entity81 ] supports our progressive values			0
more weed , less war , " a young female narrator says in the ad			0
an independent candidate polling at about 3 % in @entity93 could also push the race to a runoff in january if neither the @entity43 or @entity35 crack the 50 % vote threshold .			2

@entity4 - backed super pac is pushing two tv ads worth over $ 1.1 million to *defeat* @entity9
@entity9 , an independent , could cast the deciding vote in deciding control of the @entity10
@entity9 has n't said who he would caucus with , but @entity35 are painting him as a @entity43 - in - disguise
the ad buy follows the same group 's $ 6.5 million *injection* into 6 other competitive states
