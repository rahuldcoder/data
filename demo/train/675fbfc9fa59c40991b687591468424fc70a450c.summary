-- an @entity3 man caught leaving water bottles in the desert for illegal immigrants has been sentenced to 300 hours of community service and a year of probation , an aid group said			1
@entity9 was convicted in june of littering by leaving jugs of water in a wildlife refuge			1
@entity9 , a member of the group @entity14 , left full water bottles in december in @entity16 for the illegal immigrants who routinely pass through the 18,000 - acre refuge , according to court documents			1
a judge sentenced him tuesday to 300 hours of picking up trash on public property and a year of probation , @entity14 said in a written statement			1
he is also banned from the refuge during that time , the group said			0
although the case involved only a misdemeanor charge , both sides used the divisive issue of illegal immigration in their arguments ; @entity9 's lawyer argued that @entity33 's actions were humanitarian , but the government said otherwise			1
in a sentencing memo , the federal prosecutors wrote that @entity33 's " actions are not about humanitarian efforts , but about protesting the immigration policies of the @entity39 , and aiding those that enter illegally into the @entity39			2
" noting the phrase scrawled on many of the plastic water jugs -- " buena suerte , " or " good luck " in @entity46 -- the prosecutors said , " the obvious conclusion is that the defendant and @entity14 wish to aid illegal aliens in their entry attempt			1
" they also said , as did the @entity53 , that leaving the full plastic jugs on the refuge is detrimental to the health of the animals that live there			1
citing a biologist , the prosecutors said that animals could eat the plastic and that others could get feet or antlers caught on the bottles			1
prosecutors had requested a $ 5,000 fine , along with five years of probation , according to court documents			2
@entity9 , who @entity14 says is to begin seminary school at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , had initially refused to pay a $ 175 fine for littering , said @entity9 's lawyer , @entity74			2
after his refusal , the government enhanced the charges against him , arguing that he " knowingly littered , " said @entity74 , who is also a member of @entity14			1
the charge can carry a $ 100,000 fine and a year in jail , @entity74 said			0
charges against three other people who were cited with @entity33 in december were dropped , he said			0
a jury convicted @entity9 in june of littering			0
@entity74 said he is appealing			0
" we think that @entity9 did nothing wrong , " he said			0
" we do not think that this conviction will be upheld on appeal			0
" he described @entity9 as " the kind of guy you 'd want to have as your next door neighbor			0
" a spokeswoman for the @entity39 attorney 's office in @entity3 declined comment			2
@entity96 of the @entity16 said thursday that although he had no issue with groups leaving water out for illegal immigrants , " there 's ways to do it without leaving plastic jugs out there			1
" he said the plastic jugs were strewn throughout the refuge , which is home to hundreds of bird , reptile and mammal species , according to its web site			0
" we have sympathy for what they have to do , " he said			0
but " they have do to do it without putting plastic bottles out there			0
... you ca n't go anywhere in the refuge without seeing plastic bottles through the countryside			0
" @entity96 said refuge officials and members of @entity14 had met and were trying to come up with methods that do n't involve plastic bottles			1
@entity33 is the second member of @entity14 to be convicted of littering , according to court documents ; however , the other received a suspended sentence			2
@entity74 said that after @entity9 's conviction , 13 @entity14 members were charged with littering on the refuge			2
with tens of thousands of illegal immigrants crossing through the refuge -- @entity96 said last year 's number was about 54,000 , down from hundreds of thousands years earlier -- the last water - related death there was in june 2008 , he said .			1
