he said park officials were handing out fliers and fact sheets to park visitors and had the notices at the front desk			2
" we certainly had an extensive outreach effort , but i ca n't guarantee that every person was contacted during that week , " @entity44 said			2
@entity4 , 38 , said she and her boyfriend , @entity55 , 40 , did not find out about the hantavirus investigation until august 24 , when they found a note on their cabin that said they needed to be immediately relocated			2
when she went to the registration desk to find out what was going on , she was told about the hantavirus cases and given a pamphlet about the virus			2
we 've been taking a lot of vitamins and have been watching each other , " @entity4 said			0
" the minute anybody exhibits any flu - like symptoms , we 're going straight to the doctor			0
" @entity44 said that the situation was fluid and that officials inspected , cleaned and disinfected the cabins to make sure they were as rodent - proof as possible			1

at one point , she saw workers remove insulation from a tent nearby that an animal had shredded			2
the bottom of it was discolored by urine and had droppings			0
although @entity4 is concerned about potential exposure and is unhappy with the way the situation was handled , she and other campers said the hantavirus cases will not deter them from future vacations in @entity6 or from camping elsewhere			1
" will i camp again ? absolutely , yes , i will go camping again , " @entity4 said , adding that @entity6 is one of her favorite places			1
" that was not camping			0
that was staying in a crummy tent that was a public health risk , a public health nightmare			1

the group rented four tent cabins in @entity3 but did not stay in the signature tent cabins			1

" are you going to live your entire life in a bubble because you are afraid you are going to be exposed to something ? you just try to make the best choices you can for your family , " she said			0
" i do n't feel like enjoying nature like that is putting them at risk			1
" @entity139 , 31 , of @entity140 , @entity120 , is a frequent camper			0
many wild animals are carriers of disease , he said , and there are always risks when you stay outdoors			0

the @entity163 has said that up to 10,000 people could be at risk			1
@entity6 , which receives about 4 million visitors a year , has been contacting people who stayed in the signature tent cabins between mid-june and the end of august			1

that visitor had mild symptoms and is recovering			0
six of the people who contracted the virus are from @entity120			2
one visitor is from @entity181 and the other is from @entity183			0

rare but serious , hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by a virus that people get through contact with the urine , droppings or saliva of infected rodents , primarily deer mice			2
in @entity120 , the deer mouse is the only carrier of hantavirus , and about 14 % of mice in the state carry the disease , according to the @entity203			2

what you need to know about hantavirus people have contracted hantavirus while camping before , said @entity222 , a medical doctor and a professor at the @entity225 's @entity224 in @entity226			1
@entity222 , who has worked extensively on hantavirus , said a man camping on the floor of the @entity230 contracted the virus after a mouse ran across his face			2
" it does happen , but probably the risk to any individual person is pretty low , " he said			2
in general , the virus requires an active infestation ; many people who have contracted the virus have reported seeing live or dead mice			0
@entity222 said he would n't be surprised if there were previous cases of hantavirus connected to @entity6 that had n't been tracked back to the park			1
before this year , @entity6 had one hantavirus case in 2000 and one in 2010			1
" i think that they probably are going to need to look at their practices more carefully in that particular site , " @entity222 said			0
even though campers are warned to protect food from bears , there is no doubt a lot of food in the area , which can attract mice			0
" you ca n't have that many visitors packed in that tight with food , " he said			0
" it might not be possible to do what they are doing ( at @entity3 ) in the long - term			0
