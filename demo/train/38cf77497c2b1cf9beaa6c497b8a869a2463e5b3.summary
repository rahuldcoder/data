-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 on monday deflected concerns that the state 's new immigration law will hurt economic development , saying many businesses have long wanted tougher action			1
the new law requires @entity2 police to determine whether people are in the @entity12 legally if there is a reason to suspect they are n't			1
@entity1 signed the controversial legislation into law on friday			1
" the bottom line is that when i go about meeting with businesses that come into @entity2 ... they want to know that we have a safe and secure environment into which to move their businesses here , " @entity1 said at an @entity2 @entity18 event in @entity19			1
" they want to know that their employees are going to have a quality of life that they 've had in the places where they 're moving from to move here			0
" " i believe it 's not going to have the kind of economic impact that some people think that it might , " @entity1 , a @entity34 , said			1
would you boycott @entity2 over immigration law ? the law , scheduled to go into effect 90 days after the close of the state 's legislative session , would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times			1
previously , officers could check someone 's immigration status only if that person was suspected in another crime			1
critics say the law could foster racial profiling and prompt businesses , conventions and tourists to stay away from the state			1
the bill has prompted rallies by opponents and supporters , and some prominent politicians in @entity66 and @entity2 have criticized the measure , including @entity69 mayor @entity68 , who has said he 'll file a lawsuit to block the law			1
people have been protesting the bill outside the state @entity74 since friday , @entity0 affiliate @entity71 reported			0
" people are going to be stopped just because of the color of [ their ] skin			0
and it ai n't right , " protester @entity78 told @entity0 on sunday			0
" are they going to be looking for @entity80 as well , or is it just the brown people ? " supporters say the measure is needed because the federal government has failed to enforce its own immigration laws			2
in @entity19 on monday , @entity1 said she has written to the federal government five times about the issue in the past year and a half			2
" [ the letters ] have been met with complete , total disrespect to the people of @entity2			2
i mean , we do n't even get an answer back from our letters in regard to securing our border , " @entity1 said			2
" so , given that , i think it was time that @entity101 did step up , and that was one reason why i think that [ the new state legislation ] was signed			0
" @entity1 emphasized an executive order she issued last week to accompany the law will require additional training for local officers on how to implement the law without engaging in racial profiling			1
" i want you all to know that racial profiling is illegal			0
it 's the law , " she said monday			2
" we are going to be very diligent , and we 're going to make absolutely sure that that law ... will be implemented properly and respectfully			0
" @entity68 , @entity69 's mayor and a @entity117 , said his office hopes the @entity119 will authorize the city to file a lawsuit tuesday			1
" @entity123 [ and ] tourist business groups have already gotten dozens of calls			0
we 're pleading with them not to boycott @entity69 or the state because of [ the bill ] , " @entity68 said monday on @entity0 's " @entity125			2
" " there will be court challenges			0
i 'm confident that the federal courts will enjoin it at least until it is determined [ whether it 's ] constitutional and how to enforce it so that officers do n't get sued by individuals alleging civil rights violations			0
" president @entity136 last week called the legislation " misguided " and said the federal government must act on the immigration issue			0
" our failure to act responsible at the federal level will only open the door to irresponsibility by others			0
that includes , for example , the recent efforts in @entity2 , which threaten to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as @entity12 , as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe , " the president said in @entity66 at a naturalization ceremony for 24 members of the military			1
