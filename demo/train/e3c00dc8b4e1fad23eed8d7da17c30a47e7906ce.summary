@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 cast an eye towards the roiling sea and shrugged			1
" we 're staying , we 're local			2
we 'll figure it out			2
" his dad , @entity8 , feels the same			2
" you do n't get to see many things here normally -- everything 's pretty boring , " he says			1
not boring today , though , and it will be less so in the hours ahead			2
@entity8 , 62 , is a retired field technician for @entity14			2
he lives here year round and feels safe			2
" we 'll be fine , " he tells me			0
" if it floods , i 've got a boat , and if we need to get out quick i 've got a big truck			1
" @entity3 , 20 , was born on the island and has lived here his entire life			0
" i 'm a surfer and the waves are normally good after a storm , " he says as the wind whips down their street , shooting stinging nettles of rain into our faces			0
" it 's pretty crazy but i 'm sure we 'll be ok			1
" we 're on @entity0 on @entity1 's barrier islands -- one of the frontlines awaiting the official arrival of @entity38			1
packed with vacationers during the summer months , it 's quieter this time of year			1
most of those who remain are retired , or tourism workers taking some down time			1
if our few hours there showed @entity38 's warm - up , her actual arrival might make @entity8 and @entity3 regret their decision to stay			1
hours ahead of the worst of the weather , sea water cascades down residential streets			1
debris is already piling up on side streets , some of it jetsam from the ocean , some of it washed from front yards			1
down the road at the @entity62 , a local landmark , damage is already being done			0
the outside wooden deck is gone , the railings too , and the surf that is normally at least 50 yards away across the beach is rolling inside the club			0
a door is shattered , hanging by its hinge , the floor sodden , and members ' faces long			0
" this could be worse than 1962 , " says one of the club managers , @entity74			0
" if it 's like this now , who knows what it will be like tonight			1
" @entity74 is one of those planning to stay through the storm			0
as we speak , one of the biggest waves of the day smacks into the concrete patio and spills over us as we run inside			0
more to clean up tomorrow			0
local police chief @entity89 says emergency workers have done what they can			0
" we 've had the mandatory evacuation order out and most folks have gone , but some are determined to stay , " he says			0
" but i 'm worried			0
the sea has broken through the dunes in several places and we 're not even close to the worst of this			1
" the vast majority of residents have heeded the call to leave , and there 's a ghost town feeling			1
those who have ignored the advice to leave are hunkered down			0
not far away we find @entity106 taking a cell phone video of the sea coming over the dunes and coursing down a street			1
" i 'm not staying -- it 's a little ridiculous , " he says			1
" i want to be able to live through this			0
" it 's pretty bad			2
i was talking to one of my friends who was here in 62 and he 's leaving , so ... " @entity106 heads to his car to leave the island , leaving his unfinished sentence to speak for itself			1
we head back across the bridge to the mainland			0
" glad you got back , " says one of the police officers who 's helping block access the other way			2
" gon na be a long night			0

on @entity1 's barrier islands , most residents are leaving
a few locals remain to see out @entity38
