-- @entity2 club @entity1 has been charged over the " alleged racist behavior " of its fans during november 's @entity6 clash with @entity7			1
supporters of the @entity10 side mocked the @entity13 team 's links with the @entity15 community by chanting " @entity7 , @entity18 " ( " @entity19 " in @entity20 ) in the 0 - 0 draw in the @entity2 capital			2
@entity7 has a large contingent of @entity15 supporters , while @entity1 has long had fans with right wing sympathies			2
" proceedings will also be instigated against @entity1 for throwing of missiles and / or fireworks by their supporters , incidents of a non-sporting nature , late team arrival at the stadium , and late handling of the team sheet , " @entity27 football 's governing body @entity25 said on monday			1
it added that @entity7 also faces charges related to crowd disturbances at the @entity42 game , which took place 24 hours after a knife attack on its fans in @entity10			1
it is not the first time this season that @entity1 supporters have been accused of racism , with the club fined â ‚ ¬ 40,000 ( us $ 52,000 ) for abuse directed at @entity7 's black players during the clubs ' previous meeting in @entity55 in september			1
the charges , which will be heard on january 24 , continue a bad week for the standing of football in @entity2 , with the country 's reputation having also been " damaged " in the eyes of former prime minister @entity61 after last week 's racism walkoff involving @entity63			1
former @entity65 international @entity64 made global headlines when he reacted to abusive chanting from a section of @entity69 fans in a friendly against the fourth tier side by walking off the pitch -- and the entire @entity63 side followed him			0
his actions earned widespread praise , including from @entity63 owner @entity61 himself , but @entity78 president @entity77 is not among those who believe that @entity64 's behavior was a step in the right direction			1
" walk off ? that 's not the solution , " @entity77 was reported to have said in @entity84 - based newspaper @entity83			0
" i do n't think you can run away , because eventually you can run away if you lose a match			0
this is a very touchy subject , but there is zero tolerance of racism in the stadium			0
" despite his credibility on the topic having been damaged in the eyes of many pundits after he told @entity0 in 2011 that racism could be settled by a handshake , @entity77 is now advocating tougher punishments to deal with the issue			0
" the only solution is to be very harsh with the sanctions -- and the sanctions must be a deduction of points or something similar , " he said on sunday			0
this is the first time that @entity77 has publicly suggested a points deduction for clubs whose fans are racially abusive -- a stance which is backed by many figures within the game , including former @entity116 stars @entity114 and @entity117			0
two days after @entity64 walked off against @entity69 , racism reared its ugly head again in @entity2 as some sections of @entity1 's crowd were heard making monkey noises at @entity125 's black @entity124 striker @entity123			1
although many of the crowd inside the @entity132 for the @entity128 league clash jeered and whistled to drown out the racists , the referee was forced to halt play as he spoke to both team captains and ordered a message to be relayed over the @entity137 system to warn fans that continued chanting would result in the game 's suspension			2
late last week , former @entity63 midfielder @entity142 warned that walking off pitches in protest at abusive chanting threatened to " empower " the racist minority			2
should @entity1 be found guilty of the charges , pressure will fall on @entity25 to take tough sanctions after the body was widely criticized for issuing what was seen as a paltry $ 105,000 fine to the @entity153 fa after an under - 21 match where opposing @entity156 players said they were racially abused			1
the punishment fell short of the $ 125,800 fine @entity25 handed to @entity159 international @entity158 for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company during the 2012 @entity163 .			0

@entity1 charged by @entity25 over " alleged racist behavior " of fans during @entity6 clash
@entity7 also charged over " crowd disturbances " during november 's @entity42 tie
the charges continue a week where racism in @entity2 football has come under intense *scrutiny*
@entity78 president criticizes @entity63 's *decision* to walk off after player was racially abused
