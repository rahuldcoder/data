-- @entity1 is on the road a lot , whether he 's filming a movie in @entity5 or presenting awards to ridiculously fit people in @entity8			1
so who better to offer tips on working out while traveling ? it 's obvious the former bodybuilding champ has kept in shape			2
in a video he posted on @entity15 on thursday , @entity1 barely breaks a sweat as he tackles the elliptical and several weight machines in his hotel gym			1
" someone on @entity20 asked what it was like for me to train in hotel gyms or other unfamiliar gyms on the road , " @entity1 posted			1
" the answer is : just like it is for you			2
there is no waiting to train until you have perfect circumstances			0
i improvise with whatever is available			0
" i walk in and my only rule is to keep moving , for a pump and cardio at the same time			0
rest as little as possible			0
after an hour , you will feel fantastic and your muscles wo n't know what hit them			0
" the actor trains every day for at least an hour to be in shape for movies like " @entity42 , " which releases in theaters tonight			2
a @entity20 user posted a link to the @entity15 video on the site , and @entity1 , a frequent @entity20 contributor , jumped on to offer some more advice			1
" the point is n't the machines or the exercises , " he wrote			2
" the point is that you can create a workout for your goals anywhere			1
even if you just use a chair for dips , a table for rows and the floor for pushups			0
" @entity1 said he enjoys working out in unfamiliar gyms , even if sometimes he 'd prefer to be at home			1
" i like shocking my system , " he wrote , " so i look at the bright side			2
" you have to wonder if the bodybuilder - turned actor - turned governor - turned - actor ever gets interrupted during his workout			1
occasionally , he said , but mostly people keep to themselves			0
fair warning to fans in @entity76 , where @entity1 is filming " @entity77 " : the actor said he welcomes people who want to say hello to him while he 's resting between sets , but " do n't slow me down while i 'm working			1
" maybe it 's just us , but we would never bother someone with these biceps mid-grunt			0
of course , staring at him oddly is n't a good idea either			0
" based on the looks i 've been getting in the hotel gym , people think something is seriously wrong with donkey raises , " @entity1 posted on @entity20 earlier this month , referring to calf exercises that involve bending forward and lifting and lowering your heels			1
" i ca n't recommend them enough , though			0
