" @entity2 , " this past weekend 's mind - bending futuristic thriller from writer / director @entity5 , follows " @entity1 's " time traveling mantra : there 's no fate but what we make			1
the destiny audiences forged helped " @entity2 " land at the box office in second place , earning the film a cool $ 21.2 million			1
not bad for an r - rated action flick whose big questions would have made sci - fi novelist @entity20 smirk			1
in the film , bottom barrel assassins are handpicked to do the future mobster 's dirty work by killing targets in 2044 , 30 years before time travel is even invented			1
unfortunately , the hit men collecting silver bounty off of bodies sent to the past tend to die young ( sort of )			2
they retroactively commit suicide by murdering their future selves , giving them three decades to live life to the fullest			2
it 's also full of space - time paradoxes			1
what if you could change the future by altering the past ? that 's precisely what happens when @entity42 the looper , played by @entity44 , makes the mistake of letting his future form , played by @entity47 , escape			1
time travel is obviously a sci - fi staple , but sometimes it 's best to keep things simple			1
" we 'll be sitting here all day making diagrams with straws , " @entity47 yells at his younger self after being hounded by questions about the history of things to come			0
but believe it or not , there are scientists who study the real world possibilities of time travel , and it 's a lot of information to sip up			1
combating bad pop culture time travel @entity70 is a theoretical physicist from @entity71 who works with equations in a lab. naturally , he has a pretty good understanding of the special and general theories of relativity that illuminate the legitimate possibilities of time travel			1
however , his studies also discredit the entire premise of being able to go back in time			1
" the laws of physics were smart enough to not allow a causality violation , " @entity70 says			0
" that means that you put the effect before the cause , which is what you do when you time travel backward			1
" an example of this would be lighting a match near a gas canister and having it explode : you ca n't have an explosion without the lit match because that would be a causality violation			0
however , causality violations lead to some of " @entity2 's " most terrifying , gruesome and memorable moments			1
one scene in particular features the bodily breakdown of a looper sent to the past			2
scars act as notes on a looper 's body as they 're being carved into the past version of his being			2
soon afterward , his limbs , tongue and nose disappear			0
as his 2044 self is being tortured , we witness a paradox made of nightmares			0
@entity70 was able to further prove his point by showing that if someone wanted to construct a device that would warp space enough to go back in time , they would need to assemble and collect half of the mass of the universe			1
in " @entity2 , " the time machine is just a shoddy mechanical sphere covered in coils			1
" we wrote a paper called ' an obstacle to building a @entity134 ' in the laboratory , " @entity70 says			0
" it would require a huge warping of space - time and have huge cosmological effects			1
" these effects are dramatic enough that they would have serious consequences for the entire universe			0
theoretical physicist and @entity145 winner @entity143 further studied what could happen if one tried to travel back in time , @entity70 explains			1
" he showed that before you had enough time to go back to the past , the entire universe would collapse so that the universe would end in a big crunch , the opposite of the @entity153 , " @entity70 says			1
" that really meant to me without really much further investigation that the laws of physics abhor time travel backward			1
" @entity70 also does n't favor the belief that one could jump into the past of a parallel universe			2
" i 'm not usually a fan of describing the ultimate universe , " he says			0
" maybe if you go back in time you end up in another universe and you somehow can not affect what happens in the future			1
" ' @entity2 ' : a smart but confusing thriller in theory , there would be different outcomes in different universes			1
" i have trouble understanding that , but one of the things that bothers me about that is this : how come in our universe we never see time travelers ? " @entity182 introduced the idea in 1905 that the amount of time that elapses between two occurrences can depend upon the speed of the observer			2
" he was talking about the actual flow of time , " @entity70 says			2
" these texts only become really dramatic when you move close to the speed of light			0
" this means that while time travel to the past is virtually impossible , hopping into the future is an entirely different matter			1
if you managed to hop on a rocket and travel around @entity203 at the speed of light and one year has elapsed according to your clocks , you could return to find that it 's actually a thousand years in the future			1
" you may wonder if that 's science fiction or if it 's real , but we believe it 's real because every prediction that the special theory of relativity has ever made has been born out of experiment , " @entity70 says			0
" these effects are n't dramatic if you 're moving slowly , but they 're still there			0
" a less dramatic effect of this is the use of @entity221			0
the clocks in satellites that triangulate where you need to go move at a different rate because they 're moving at a high speed			0
" they 're not moving fast , but they 're moving at a speed relative to you on @entity203 , " @entity70 says			0
" there 's enough of an effect that if they did n't correct for the slowing of the clock that you would not be driving on the road			0
" if you could n't travel at light speed on a rocket as a shortcut to the future , a hypothetical alternative would have you creating a strong gravitational force replicating a black hole			1
" i could put you on a rope , and i could lower you into the very strong gravitational field of the black hole , " @entity70 explains			0
but there 's a certain point that could n't be passed			0
" once you get too close to a black hole , there 's no force that can overcome the force of the gravitational force , and you 're doomed			0
" the proposition is scary : " you can just hover near the boundary where doom occurs , " @entity70 says			0
" if you were hovering there , then your clocks would be running slower than mine			0
" being closer to the black hole would allow one to age less and experience time differently			2
" we could have a reality tv show , " @entity70 proposes			0
" a whole day would go by for me , and i would just see you reaching for your breakfast			0
" technically , the subjects of this time travel experiment could stay in touch through electromagnetic waves			1
" finally , we could come together and i could pull you out of the strong gravitational field , " he says			0
" you could see that you had n't aged very much and i 've aged a lot , but you would n't be surprised because we 've kept in touch the entire time			2
" long story short : if you have the ability to travel at light speed or a strong gravitation field , taking a short path to the future is possible			2
however , " @entity2 " presents a one - way trip to the past aside from montage sequences that show what 's happening to @entity47 in the year 2070			1
that begs the question : if we 're unable to go back to the past , how can the past exist ? " the past exists as memory , " @entity70 says			2
we have books , we have movies , and we have memories			0
" the past exists in the present because it has an imprint on the present , but the future does n't , " he says			2
but we do have the ability to see the past			2
" you just need to look at the light from a distant galaxy , " @entity70 points out			0
" it depends on how far the galaxy is , but it could be a billion years ago			0
astronomers are looking at ancient images all the time			0
" despite whatever causality violations and problematic backward time traveling devices @entity5 presents , " @entity2 " is a strong sci - fi depiction of time travel			1
the audience holds the ultimate key to its plausibility : the suspension of disbelief			0
if you could time travel , where would you go and what would you do ? let us know in the comments below .			1
