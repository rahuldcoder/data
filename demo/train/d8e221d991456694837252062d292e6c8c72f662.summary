" @entity2 , the poorest country in the region , is home to @entity26 , or @entity26 , which most recently claimed responsibility for the massacre of journalists at the @entity31 satirical magazine @entity30 in @entity32			1

many would - be jihadis from the @entity87 are recruited into @entity26 through a slick @entity89 online magazine , @entity88 , that 's run out of @entity2			1
@entity49 officials consider @entity26 the most dangerous branch of @entity26 , according to @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity92			2
it 's actually a three - way battle among the government , the @entity11 and @entity26			1
the @entity11 , a rebel group composed of @entity12 , feel marginalized in the majority @entity96 country			2
in september , @entity11 seized government buildings in @entity40 and its airport			1

on monday , the government and the @entity11 announced another ceasefire			1
@entity22 has battled @entity26 since taking office in 2012 , and the @entity49 has invested heavily in this campaign			2
he reorganized @entity2 's military , and for a while put @entity26 on the defensive			1
but the conflict with the @entity11 diverted resources that could be used against @entity26			1
@entity26 is working to keep things unstable , but it does n't look like the group has been involved in the @entity40 fighting so far			1
in october , @entity26 staged a suicide bombing against a @entity11 rally that killed 50 people			1
it also released a video showing members executing 14 @entity11			2

some presidential officials are worried about actions by republican guards , former regime officials who are still loyal to @entity179 , the ex-president who was kicked out in 2012 during the @entity6			0
chaos is good for terrorists			0
