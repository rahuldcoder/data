-- quick -- name a planet with rings			1
easy , right ? but @entity3 and others are not alone : now scientists have added another celestial body to the short list of objects in our solar system that have rings around them			1
the remote asteroid @entity14 orbits between @entity3 and @entity15 in the outer solar system			1
researchers published a study in the journal nature showing evidence of rings around it			2
lead author @entity23 of the @entity25 / @entity24 in @entity26 said the discovery came as a complete surprise			2
" we were n't looking for a ring and did n't think small bodies like @entity14 had them at all , " he said in a statement			1
@entity14 is fairly small -- 250 kilometers ( 150 miles ) in diameter			1
it is classified as a " centaur , " an object that has an unstable orbit and crosses giant planets ' orbits			0
mythological centaurs had both human and horse features , while centaurs in the solar system may have both comet and asteroid characteristics			2
the asteroid is only the fifth solar system object whose rings have been detected			1
@entity52 , @entity3 , @entity15 and @entity53 also have rings			2
telescopes at seven different locations , including the @entity59 's @entity58 site in @entity60 , saw a star seem to disappear for a few seconds on june 3 , 2013			0
this happened because the star 's light was obscured by @entity14			1
the star 's brightness also diminished a few seconds before and after that main blocking of light			0
astronomers discovered that rings were responsible , and calculated their size , shape and orientation			2
the two rings orbiting the asteroid are relatively narrow : 7 kilometers and 3 kilometers across			1
they are separated by a gap of 9 kilometers			0
scientists are informally calling these rings @entity80 and @entity81 , after rivers near the northern and southern ends of @entity84			2
the gravitational interactions from small moons may be keeping the orbiting material in ring form , scientists said			0
" so , as well as the rings , it 's likely that @entity14 has at least one small moon still waiting to be discovered , " @entity90 - @entity23 said in a statement			1
and someday the rings themselves may lead to a moon being formed , scientists said			1
on a larger scale , a similar process could have been involved in the making of our own moon , as well as other planetary satellites			0
how these rings came to be is mysterious			0
one idea is that a collision created a disc of debris , the @entity59 said			0
" this discovery suggests that the event ( s ) responsible for the origin of the rings is relatively recent , or that a fortuitous balance of forces have combined to help sustain them , " said @entity110 , deputy principal investigator for @entity113 's @entity112 mission , which aims to visit a near - @entity115 asteroid and bring a sample back to @entity115			1
@entity110 was not involved with this study			0
scientists planning @entity112 , targeting an asteroid called @entity127 , are finding challenges with the dynamics of small celestial bodies , @entity110 said			1
the nature study reinforces the idea that asteroids , comets and other relatively small bodies are " no longer second - class citizens in our solar system , " he said			0
" indeed , they may harbor important clues about the origins and mechanisms that helped create our planet earth , and the processes that supported the rise of life here , " he said			0

@entity151 telescope *observations* found rings around an asteroid
the asteroid , called @entity14 , may also have a moon
some day the rings themselves may lead to a moon being formed
