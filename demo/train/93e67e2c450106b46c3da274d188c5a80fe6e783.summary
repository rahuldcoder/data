@entity0 -- a monster blizzard has left at least one person dead and hundreds of thousands of @entity5 in the dark and in the cold friday night , thanks to a storm that 's already delivered whipping winds and more than a foot of snow in some parts , with prospects of even double that by the time it 's done			1
the storm -- actually the convergence of two powerful systems -- began in earnest friday morning in parts of @entity19 and is expected to continue well into saturday in @entity20 , eastern @entity21 and @entity22			1
@entity23 was more or less continuous for much of the region all day , with some lulls as well as times when it picked up considerably			0
at one point friday night , for instance , @entity29 's emergency management agency warned on @entity32 that " a wide ban of extremely heavy snow " was moving through the central and eastern parts of the @entity29 , dropping snow at a staggering rate of 4 to 5 inches an hour			1
@entity39 , @entity20 , had 14 inches of snow by 9 p.m. friday , one of several towns in that state , @entity29 and @entity21 to be buried under more than a foot of snow -- with much more , potentially , on the way			1
" i could n't believe the amount of snow that had piled up , as well as the many fallen branches , " said @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity20			1
she was among the tens of millions of people stranded in the blizzard 's path			0
many were prohibited by authorities from driving as a preemptive measure while other roads were closed in the thick of the bad weather , as was the case late friday for @entity19 's @entity62 and @entity63 , according to the @entity64			0
others saw their travel plans squashed when more than 5,000 flights from some 60 airports were canceled			0
and @entity69 nixed several of its scheduled runs , citing the weather , while commuter rail service in and out of @entity19 and other locales were also impacted			0
track the storm on map , timeline that helped transform several @entity5 communities into ghost towns , as streets that typically would be choked with traffic were quiet , except for whistling winds ; and empty , except for a blanket of thick , sticky snow			1
@entity84 sent in photos and video from @entity0 , for instance , that showed sheets of white on the ground -- except when whipping winds made for near whiteout conditions on camera -- and little movement on the streets			0
" @entity0 is kind of eerie at the moment , " said @entity96 , a veteran snowplow driver doing his best to keep the roads clear			0
" people are off the streets , and it looks like it could be 3 o'clock in the morning			0
" strong winds made this storm especially biting			2
by friday night , the @entity105 reported wind gusts around 70 mph along the @entity21 coast and through greater @entity0 , including a 74 - mph gust in @entity109 on @entity110 " the wind is just pounding , " @entity1 ireporter @entity111 said from @entity113 , off @entity21 ' southern coast			1
" it 's currently moving the jeep that we 're in -- that 's how powerful it is			0
" such strong winds threatened to rustle up flooding along the coast at high tide saturday morning			0
in the seaside @entity21 town of @entity127 , for instance , the emergency management agency noted there may be a storm surge of between two to three feet and forecast a " serious event with moderate to major impact " around 10 a.m. saturday			1
police in @entity133 , @entity19 , said one person died in a storm - related vehicle accident there , the first fatality that @entity1 has confirmed from the blizzard			1
the storm also damage for those not living directly on the coast , as evidenced by extensive power outages around the region			1
for many more people , the storm 's impact will be in the form of widespread power outages			1
by early saturday , more than 600,000 customers -- most in @entity21 , @entity20 and @entity29 -- were without electricity , a number that could grow			1
apps to help get you through for some , it all evoked memories of the " @entity156 of ' 78 " and the " @entity157 of 2003 " -- two of dozens of winter storms in @entity21 that @entity96 has been out on the streets			1
the @entity162 resident bundled up to brave the bitter cold and clear snow off the roads			2
but with a storm this powerful , it sometimes seems like a losing battle			2
" i just finished plowing a 40 - car parking lot , " said @entity96			2
" but if you were to look at it now , you never would have guessed			0
" alarms raised , events canceled ahead of the storm authorities have been sounding the alarm about the coming storm for days , urging people to stock up and stay off the roads			2
the worries were especially pronounced in places slammed by @entity182			0
that late october storm tore through @entity186 's @entity185 home , leaving him personally " destroyed " and cognizant that there may be more hits coming			2
" you ca n't mess with @entity192 , " an emotional @entity189 said			0
lines of customers snaked around storefronts as many braced for the worst			2
when @entity198 , @entity21 , resident @entity197 arrived at a grocery store late thursday night , shoppers were already buying up the store			1
" it 's a zoo in there , " she said			0
" there 's nothing left on the shelves , " she told @entity1 affiliate @entity203			0
governors across @entity5 and @entity19 have declared states of emergency , and all cars and trucks -- except emergency vehicles -- must now be off @entity21 and @entity29 roadways			1
a similar ban in @entity20 took effect at 5 p.m. violating that ban could incur a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $ 500 fine			1
by friday night , the storm had already led to hundreds of cancellations of public school classes to sporting events			2
the storm even prompted the cancellation of @entity226 tests , for would - be college students , around the @entity228			1
utility companies tried to get a head start on the storm , by having additional crews ready to respond to outages caused by downed power lines			1
the fear is that , as happened after @entity182 , such outages could persist for days			0
still , for all the alarms being raised , the mayor of @entity0 -- which forecasters expected would be the city hardest hit by the storm -- said he expected residents of his community and others to hunker down and weather the storm			0
said mayor @entity246 , " we are hardy @entity5			0
" 5 ways to keep your phone charged in a power outage @entity1 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity23 , @entity256 and @entity257 contributed to this report .			2
