@entity0 , @entity1 -- as one of @entity1 's richest self - made women , @entity3 has an impressive resume			1
her business @entity8 , worth $ 800million , is one of @entity1 's leading drug companies and employs more than 6,000 people at its vast campus in @entity0			1
@entity3 was named among @entity14 's 100 " @entity13 " in the world in 2012 , in the @entity18 ' " the top 50 women in world business " in 2011 and @entity20 's " @entity19 " in 2010			2
but it was a very different story in 1978 when @entity3 started @entity8 at the age of 25 with the equivalent of less than $ 200 in today 's money			1
she founded the company in a garage and -- as a woman and one of the first pioneers of biotechnology in @entity1 -- found it difficult to obtain both staff and funding			1
" i had a lot of foolish courage because when i started up the company i found i had huge credibility challenges to overcome , " said @entity3			2
" i was a 25 - year - old woman with no business experience , i was trying to pioneer a sector called biotechnology which nobody had heard of			0
" i therefore had huge challenges from getting financial backing to even getting people to work in the organization			0
" @entity3 originally qualified as @entity1 's first master brewer , but became an entrepreneur after failing to find a job in brewing			1
" i was finding it very difficult to get a job as a brew master , " she said			0
" it was a chance encounter with a biotech entrepreneur from @entity54 that got me started as an entrepreneur in @entity1 , because i partnered this @entity57 company in setting up @entity1 's first biotech company			1
" she added : " it has taken me over 30 years to get from a garage to the huge campus that we have today			0
and it 's been a long journey -- it 's been a very exciting journey			0
" having built up a leading company from scratch , many would expect @entity3 to have her mind fixed solely on the business			2
but she also has a social mission to expand access to healthcare in @entity1			1
also on leading women : a brighter picture for women in art " @entity1 is a country where 80 % of healthcare ( spend ) is out of pocket ; where 80 % of healthcare infrastructure is in the private sector ; where most people do n't have access to quality healthcare , " she said			1
in 2009 , she founded a low - cost cancer hospital with the aim of making usually expensive cancer treatment accessible to more people			0
" i felt there was a crying need for a comprehensive cancer center which also addresses affordability , " said @entity3			2
her goal to make healthcare more accessible for all @entity1 has driven her to search for a cheaper model of drug development			1
" we simply can not afford to develop drugs that cost $ 1 - 3 billion to develop , because these drugs will not actually reach people who really need ( them ) the most , " she said			2
" you will only be confining it to a very few people in the world who can afford it			0
" we 've got to change this model			0
i believe that we have enough technology in the world to bring down this cost of innovation			0
" also on leading women : why women will impact global economy as much as @entity115 one achievement of which @entity3 is particularly proud is helping to reverse @entity1 's brain drain of scientists			1
she employs almost 5,000 scientists , of whom just under 40 % are women and many have returned to @entity1 from abroad			1
" one of my objectives when i started @entity8 was to make sure that i create a company for women scientists to pursue a vocation , " said @entity3			1
" and i wanted to make sure that we created a research environment for scientists , because at that time we were facing a very strong brain drain of scientists and engineers from @entity1 , there just were n't enough companies to employee such people			1
" the challenges ahead for @entity3 include getting @entity8 to the billion dollar mark , and continuing to innovate			1
" there 's a huge journey ahead for me			0
there are many , many more milestones ahead , " she said			0
" i want to be remembered as someone who put @entity1 on the scientific map of the world in terms of large innovation			2
" i want to be remembered for making a difference to global healthcare			0
and i want to be remembered as someone who did make a difference to social economic development in @entity1			2
" a side effect is that people might also remember how wealthy she is			0
" i hate the title of being called the richest woman in @entity1 , but it 's the recognition that this was the value that i had created as a woman entrepreneur and that makes me very , very proud			0
