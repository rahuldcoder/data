-- a year ago , @entity1 was one of the most powerful and talked - about politicians in @entity3			1
he was a member of @entity3 's ruling body , the @entity4 , and he seemed to have a shot at gaining a seat on the key decision - making unit within it , the @entity9			1
but on march 15 , he was removed from his post as the party secretary of @entity12			2
today , he 's still one of the most - talked about men in @entity3 , not for how far he 'll rise but for how far he 's destined to fall			1
@entity14 and determined , @entity1 was primarily known for launching bold initiatives , such as encouraging the mass singing of " red songs " ( revolutionary anthems from the days of chairman @entity19 ) and pushing for high - profile drives to rid his inland , south - central city of organized crime			2
the rise and fall of @entity3 's @entity1 the circumstances surrounding @entity1 's fall are intriguing			1
was it a power struggle or did he flout the law ? in february , one of @entity1 's top lieutenants , whom he abruptly demoted , went to the @entity33 consulate presumably to seek political asylum			1
last week , the @entity36 government asked the @entity3 government to investigate the mysterious death of a @entity36 businessman who claimed to have close ties to @entity1 's family			1
despite this drama , @entity3 leaders are hoping to minimize disturbances ahead of the major leadership transition of the @entity46 in the fall			1
so , what can we learn from this strange tale so far ? 1			0
no matter how unified the leaders at the top of @entity3 's power structure seems , there are bound to be fissures			1
factional divides might be linked to a number of factors , such as personal style , family history , regional identity or ideology			0
after the @entity64 , @entity3 's leaders tried to show that factionalism was a thing of the past			2
but today , we know fissures may be hidden but can surface anytime			0
@entity1 and the politics of @entity3 succession riding on his popularity before his fall , @entity1 took the step of trying to secure a seat on the @entity9 by an unusual method			1
he seemed more like someone campaigning for votes rather than striving simply to get a nod of approval from the top @entity3 leaders			2
in a country that has very limited democracy and only local elections , this seemed out of place			0
historical symbolism can be useful , but it can turn into political dynamite			0
@entity1 's rise was helped by his skill at playing to nostalgia for specific aspects of the @entity19 years			1
his promotion of old nationalist songs and presentation of himself as a fearless crusader against corruption and urban crime won him broad praise and support			0
but invoking the @entity102 past proved to be a double - edged sword			0
the first clear indication that @entity1 was about to fall came when premier @entity105 gave a speech in march when he talked of the danger of any recurrence of " @entity110 " patterns			1
to invoke the specter of the @entity110 is always to conjure up images of destabilizing " turmoil " of a kind most @entity3 would rather never see again			2
@entity1 's tactics made it all too easy for his political opponents to call him out			1
purges in @entity3 are unpredictable			2
it 's hard to figure out what to call what has happened to @entity1 , who has been demoted but not detained and retains membership in the @entity4			2
he is definitely on the outs , so the term " purge " comes to mind , but the story is not finished			0
consider @entity128 , @entity19 's immediate successor , who was pushed aside after a few years by @entity129 , yet lived out his days as a minor official			0
@entity131 himself , who was in favor , out of favor and then back in favor as the leader of the @entity46			0
at the other end of the spectrum is @entity139 , a chosen successor to @entity131 who was ousted for taking too lenient a stance toward the 1989 protests and remained under house arrest until his death			0
and powerful mayors who were made scapegoats for anti-corruption drives and eventually executed			0
we just do n't know at what point on this spectrum @entity1 will end up			0
@entity1 's story seems hard to follow for outsiders , but nonetheless , it 's worth watching			1
in @entity3 , the most important leadership decisions are made by small groups huddling behind closed doors			0
this means that unexpected incidents such as @entity1 's fall offer precious if hard to decipher signs			1
@entity3 high politics remains a black box in many ways , and like those in airplanes , its secrets will only be revealed when there 's a crash			1
there 's no indication of that happening to the @entity46 anytime soon , so for now we should make the most of the hints			2
one thing we can be sure of : we have n't seen the last of factional politics in the @entity46			1
perhaps the strongest evidence of this is how the official press has been full of statements about the leadership being unified			0
when this sort of message is made too forcefully , there is likely widespread anxiety about its truthfulness			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity1 , once a powerful politician in @entity3 , was removed from his post in march
@entity189 : @entity1 's story is intriguing -- was it power struggle or did he flout law ?
he says incidents like @entity1 's fall offer precious clues about state of @entity3 government
@entity189 : factional politics indicate @entity46 is not as unified as it seems
