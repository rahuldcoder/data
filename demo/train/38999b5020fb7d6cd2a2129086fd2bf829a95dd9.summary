something struck @entity2 's aunt when her nephew arrived in southern @entity4 last year			1
he prayed regularly , she said			2
he avoided looking women in the eye			2
his transformation into a devout muslim was a radical change			2
less than a year since @entity10 last saw her nephew , he is dead			0
the @entity11 says he and his younger brother were behind the @entity14 bombings that killed three people and injured more than 170			2
authorities say @entity2 died after a gunfight with police early friday			1
but the suspects ' possible motive remains a mystery			0
and a key question has emerged as investigators comb through clues : what did @entity2 do during a trip to @entity4 from january to july of last year ? according to family accounts , @entity2 visited @entity28 , where his father lives			1
after @entity2 returned to the @entity31 in @entity32 , a video of an @entity34 militant known as @entity35 was posted and then removed from @entity2 's @entity37 channel			1
suspect posted video of jihadist , analysis shows five months after @entity2 left @entity28 , @entity4 security forces there killed @entity35 during a gunbattle that left a home in shambles			1
it 's unclear whether @entity2 ever met @entity35 , or had any ties with the militant group he led			1
information about @entity2 's trip to @entity4 has been hard to come by			1
but speaking to @entity52 from @entity28 on monday , @entity10 revealed new details about what @entity2 did there , and how his family perceived his behavior			1
the @entity60 connection side trip to @entity62 @entity10 said @entity2 traveled to @entity62 twice , likely going to see his father 's family in @entity65 and @entity66 -- towns less than 200 kilometers ( about 125 miles ) away that were flashpoints in fighting between @entity4 forces and @entity71 rebels during their longstanding tensions in 1990s			1
@entity2 was born in 1986 in @entity74 to an ethnically @entity62 family , his uncle said last week			1
his birthplace is in a part of the world that 's no stranger to violence or terrorism , and the @entity2 family saw that firsthand			1
the family fled violence in @entity74 and lived in @entity62 when war broke out there between separatists and @entity4 forces in 1999 , @entity10 told @entity52			1
but she described her nephew 's visit to the region last year as a peaceful trip focused on rebuilding family connections			2
" he tried to reestablish family ties			0
... he went to see people , people came to see him , and of course , he went to pray , " she said			0
during the trip , she said , what surprised her and others in the family was the way @entity2 's behavior had changed since he went to the @entity31 in 2003			1
it had become more conservative			0
" they had n't prayed before they went to @entity31			0
nobody taught him , " @entity10 said			0
" he learned everything himself			0
" the change was notable , she said			0
" at the same time , " she said , " we were happy about it , because he did n't start doing drugs or alcohol and adopted the path to @entity34			0
" @entity2 's parents were n't as devout , she said			1
" and it is very strange to me that it was him who adopted @entity34 , not his father , not his mother , but himself , " she said			0
" but it 's not so strange because nowadays the children study @entity34 and teach their parents , and that 's exactly how it turned out with him			2
" @entity2 's behavior made his beliefs clear , she said			1
source : suspect says brother was brains behind attack " you know , he and other men do n't even touch other women , i mean , he does n't speak to them ( other women ) , " she recalls			0
" he could speak to his sisters , his cousins and me , and other women are of no significance to him because it 's a sin to even look at other women in the eye			2
" that faith , @entity10 said , was one reason she believes there is no way her nephews could be behind the @entity155 bombings			2
" in @entity34 , killing a non-muslim is like killing all humanity , " she said , " and killing a @entity158 is like killing the whole world			0
" @entity10 recalled being with @entity2 's parents last week as the same grainy pictures of their sons that were broadcast around the world flashed on their television screen			1
his father , @entity165 , pointed			0
he was certain the two men were his sons			0
their mother , @entity168 , the aunt remembered , grabbed the television			2
" it ca n't be , it ca n't be happening , " she screamed			0
" i do n't believe it			0
children are dead ! " earlier that week , @entity168 had been worried for her sons after hearing about the explosions			0
when she asked how they were doing in a phone conversation , the brothers said they loved her and that everything was " pretty normal , " @entity10 said			0
" @entity178 , we are totally fine , " they said , according to @entity10			0
" we miss your warmth and your caress			0
" suspect 's wife ' very distraught ' @entity4 's fight with @entity34 militants in a building on the other side of the city , the walls are still scarred from a fierce gunbattle between @entity4 security forces and @entity193 militants that erupted last year			1
fallen cinder blocks litter the ground inside			0
neighbors told @entity52 that @entity35 and the other young men who once lived in the building seemed peaceful and ordinary			2
but in late december 2012 , authorities brought in an armored vehicle to kill @entity35 , whose real name was @entity203			1
there are no clues in the rubble left behind that offer answers to a troubling question : why did @entity2 's @entity37 page link to the rants of the militant who died here ? in august 2012 , soon after returning from @entity4 to the @entity31 , @entity2 apparently created a @entity37 channel with links to a number of videos			1
two videos under a category labeled " terrorists " have since been deleted			0
it 's not clear when or by whom			2
one of those videos showed @entity35 , who led a small militant group that had links to the most potent @entity193 group in the region			1
@entity31 officials told @entity52 analyst @entity227 on sunday they have found no further connection between @entity2 and @entity35 , but the investigation into his activities overseas continues			1
in 2011 , before his visit to @entity4 , @entity231 asked the @entity11 to investigate @entity2 in the @entity31 , according to the @entity11			1
" the request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical @entity34 and a strong believer , and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the @entity31 for travel to the country 's region to join unspecified underground groups , " the @entity11 said in a statement			2
some details have also emerged about what @entity2 did after he returned from @entity4 , including a january incident at a mosque in @entity248 , @entity249			1
during a sermon about gaining inspiration from the story of slain civil rights leader @entity254 , @entity2 interrupted the preacher , the @entity250 of @entity155 said in a statement monday			1
@entity2 stood up , shouted at the preacher , accused him of " contaminating people 's mind " and called him a hypocrite , the society said , citing accounts from congregants			1
some members of the congregation shouted back at @entity2 , telling him to " leave now			2
" leaders of the mosque later told him he would no longer be welcome at the mosque if he continued to interrupt sermons			0
at future prayers , he was quiet			0
suspects : an immigrant journey that went off track			0
