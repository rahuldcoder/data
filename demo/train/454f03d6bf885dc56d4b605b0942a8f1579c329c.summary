in january , @entity0 unveiled @entity1 , a more robust search tool that 's being slowly rolled out to users			1
it uses the mountains of data the site collects to expand what a query on the site can find			2
planning a trip and want a list of college friends who have moved to @entity14 ? no problem			2
co-workers who also like " @entity17 ? " check			0
how about @entity0 photos from @entity19 ? you got it			2
and , to take it to a somewhat different place , how about single friends of friends who live in the same city you do ? also doable			2
@entity0 is taking its time			0
only a few hundred thousand of the site 's hundreds of millions of users have gotten access so far , and the company is tweaking the test version of the feature as it goes			1
@entity35 , product manager for search at @entity0 , visited @entity38 headquarters recently and shared thoughts on the social - media giant 's biggest product launch in some time			1
the following interview has been edited for style and brevity : @entity38 : how 's the rollout process been so far , and what early customer feedback have you received ? @entity35 : we 're still rolling out very slowly			1
it 's still in beta			2
even though hundreds of thousand of people have it now , and that sounds like a big number , @entity0 overall features over a billion users so still a small percentage of the user base			1
however , it 's enough where we 're starting to get feedback , and the reception so far has been pretty positive			2
people seem to find it most useful around people and photos queries			0
places are the thing they are starting to like as well			0
and the things we continue hearing in terms of where we need to improve is , we have to do a much better job understanding everything that people type into the search box			0
users phrase queries in many different ways and than we initially anticipated and we have to invest in that			0
for example , the number of different of ways refer to friends			0
we had to build the product to recognize " buddies , " " pals , " " besties " and all of the other variations of the word " friend			0
" how is a @entity1 different from a @entity91 web search ? it 's different in a lot of ways			1
one obvious way is users are only searching on related results in @entity0 with @entity1 as opposed to a web search where you 're searching across all indexed documents on the @entity101			1
i think people come to a web search engine with a different set of expectations -- what they want and expect to do , versus their experience on @entity0 , which tends to be socially oriented			0
also , with a web search engine , users are accustomed to typing in a set of keywords and receiving documents from the @entity101 that most closely match -- but with @entity1 , users type in a very specific query using simple phrases to yield relevant results			1
for example , if users type " show me my friends who like ' @entity120 , ' " or " show me my college friends who live in @entity122 , " @entity1 is n't searching based on those keywords but rather displaying the answers to those specific queries			1
review : @entity0 's @entity1 is promising but incomplete what are the most common search trends so far , and how do you expect that to evolve over time ? people and photos , by far			1
users tend to search and explore their friends , primarily			1
my friends who like a certain thing or participate in a specific activity			0
show me my friends who like " @entity120 " and " @entity138 " because i want to have a trilogy party or show me my friends who like running and live in @entity140			0
also seeing more and more people use @entity1 for dating purposes because friends of friends tend to be a good source of potential dates			1
people queries have mostly been around exploring their friends and a little bit on the periphery of their friends ' circles			0
this is the first time users can look over all of the @entity0 photos your friends have shared			1
show me the photos of my friends taken before 1995 or show me the photos of my friends in @entity163			1
a third behavior around using @entity1 for places is also increasing			2
users can explore new travel sites , restaurants , etc. , through likes and activities of their friends and / or locals			2
@entity0 highlights privacy protection for minors on @entity1 how could @entity1 be used for job recruiting or career placement opportunities ? as we 've discussed , much of the power of @entity1 tool is through the ability to access information of friends of friends because that tends to be very rich data			1
with career networking , often times the essential edge is via friends of current employees of the desired career opportunity			0
recruiters can also cross-reference applicants with connected friends already working at the company ideal for reference checks or to assist with follow up contact			0
graph search users are also able to query by job title and additional background for a smarter recruiting strategy			2
up until now , most people have n't thought of ways to use @entity0 professionally , but now there 's plenty of reason to do that if recruiters begin to better leverage @entity1			1
this should motivate more users to fill out their profile information ( employment history , current city , schools ) so they can be more easily discovered this way			0
internet security is often a sensitive and important issue with new products and services offered on the public internet			0
what privacy measures have been accounted for within @entity1 ? we understand people care deeply about how they appear in search			1
this is an area we 've spent quite a bit of time and effort on to ensure that we have an experience that matches people 's expectations			0
the worst thing that can happen around privacy is when people are surprised			0
this is something we 've tried very had to bring to people 's attention -- to understand what is searchable about them on @entity0 and how they can control it			1
we offer the @entity242 available through the @entity244 feature for easy view and management of what and how users are sharing content and on terms they feel comfortable .			0

@entity1 making site 's search more robust
manager says friends and photos are most common searches so far
@entity261 can be used to control what 's searchable about a user
@entity1 is rolling out slowly to the site 's users
