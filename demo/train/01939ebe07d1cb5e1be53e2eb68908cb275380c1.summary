-- despite the election cycle rhetoric surrounding immigration , which would make it seem like the rest of the world is swarming across @entity8 borders like ants to a picnic , gobbling up our resources , the reality is quite different			1
there are a number of myths that we must dispel in order to forge a sound policy , or else we risk our own potential downfall in the long run			1
the first myth is that @entity8 continues to be a nation of immigrants			1
the second is that everyone who is thinking of emigrating wants to come to the @entity8 @entity27 is the idea that we beat the competition in attracting the best and brightest immigrants			1
lastly is the belief that immigrants end up as a burden on our economy			1
all of these false notions shape public perception and reaction to immigration reform			1
if we are to succeed in the next century , we need to base our decisions on facts			0
while @entity8 at one point had a huge influx of immigrants , today the picture is quite different			1
according to the @entity47 , the number of immigrants is almost four times what it was 100 years ago			2
but if we look at it as a percentage of the total @entity8 population , we see that it is about 13 % , which is not an all - time high			0
as recently as 20 years ago , @entity8 was the premier destination of all aspiring immigrants			2
today , this is no longer the case			0
as a percentage of population , @entity61 and @entity62 both have significantly higher rates of foreign - born residents than the @entity8 , at approximately 20 % and 26 % respectively			1
in fact , @entity8 's rate of foreign - born population -- about 13 % -- is now on par with those of @entity71 and @entity72			0
@entity8 also no longer draws the smartest people from around the world			0
compared with countries like @entity61 , @entity76 and @entity62 , the @entity8 has a greater proportion of low - skilled rather than high - skilled immigrants			1
about 30 % of immigrants in the @entity8 possess a low level of education , and only 35 % possess a high level of education			2
in @entity61 , only 22 % of immigrants have a low level of education , while more than 46 % have a high level of education			1
countries like @entity61 attract a greater influx of immigrants with higher education levels and specialized skills through immigration policies that specifically favor visa applicants with advanced degrees or work experience			1
in contrast , @entity8 policies place more emphasis on family relationships and less consideration on skills or education levels when granting permanent residence			2
perhaps the most persistent modern immigration myth is that immigrants are a drain on our economy , which is simply not true			1
taxes paid by immigrants and their children -- both legal and illegal -- exceed the costs of the services they use			2
a 2007 report from the @entity117 concluded that immigration as a whole increases the @entity8 gdp by roughly $ 37 billion each year			2
a cost estimate by the @entity122 in 2007 found that a path to legalization for unauthorized immigrants would increase federal revenues by $ 48 billion but would incur only $ 23 billion of increased costs from public services , producing a surplus of $ 25 billion for government coffers			2
and according to a @entity132 report , increases in immigration have improved @entity132 's finances			2
the consensus of the economic analysis is that the taxes paid by immigrants and their descendants exceed the benefits they receive			0
even with undocumented immigrants , the @entity140 estimates that they paid almost $ 50 billion in federal taxes between 1996 to 2003 , including payroll and @entity132 ( about $ 8.5 billion per year ) , property ( directly or as part of rental payments ) and sales taxes			0
nonetheless , about 40 % of undocumented immigrants ( @entity149 ) currently work off the books and consequently pay lower taxes			0
but if we look at their purchasing power , we find that undocumented immigrants sustain hundreds of thousand of @entity8 jobs			0
one study estimates ( @entity149 ) that @entity158 buying power totaled $ 951 billion in 2008 and will increase to $ 1.4 trillion by 2013			0
@entity160 buying power totaled $ 509.1 billion in 2008 and is expected to increase to $ 752.3 billion by 2013			0
countries such as @entity61 and @entity62 realized earlier that immigration policy is intrinsically linked to their economic success			1
where @entity8 immigration policy attempts to address economic realities is in the @entity168 visa classification for highly skilled workers			1
however , the caps , quotas and numbers do n't really work			0
ten weeks after the application filing period opened for @entity168 visas for fiscal year 2013 , @entity173 had reached the statutory cap			0
many @entity8 companies are struggling to fill 3.6 million job openings in the @entity8 , many of them in science - and technology - related fields			0
the cap stifles economic growth for 10 months until the next @entity168 visa application filing period begins			0
" the continued failure to devise and implement a sound and sustainable immigration policy threatens to weaken @entity8 's economy , to jeopardize its diplomacy , and to imperil its national security , " concludes a @entity186 report co-chaired by former @entity188 gov. @entity187 and former clinton white house chief of staff @entity189			1
just as a teenager grows up and dismisses the simplistic views espoused in the fairy tales of childhood , so too must we as a nation face the reality that we are no longer the world leader in welcoming talent			0
we still have a good chance in regaining the monopoly of what made our nation so great in the first place : a clustering of the best and the brightest from around the world			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

@entity215 : three myths about immigration must be ignored
@entity215 : contrary to beliefs , immigrants contribute to our country ; they are not a burden
he says countries like @entity61 and @entity62 have policies that promote their economies
@entity215 : by *changing* our immigration policy , we can again attract the best and brightest
