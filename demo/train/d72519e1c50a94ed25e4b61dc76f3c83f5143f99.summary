@entity0 -- the @entity0 @entity2 agreed wednesday to send the @entity4 application for statehood to its admissions committee for review			1
the first meeting of that committee , which includes all 15 members of the council , is set for friday			1
the debate is expected to be largely symbolic in the face of a promised @entity15 veto			1
but the permanent observer of the @entity17 to the @entity0 , @entity16 , held out hope that the application would be accepted			1
" as you see , the process is moving forward step by step , and we hope the @entity2 ( will ) shoulder its responsibility and approve our application and send a recommendation to the @entity28 for the admission of @entity30 into the @entity0 , " @entity16 said wednesday			1
he also sharply criticized @entity32 's approval tuesday of the construction of 1,100 homes in a southern @entity36 neighborhood that was seized by @entity32 in 1967			1
the @entity4 claim the land @entity32 occupied in @entity36 and the @entity38 after the 1967 war as part of a future @entity4 state			2
@entity16 said the settlements were " 1,100 answers of saying no " to peace talks by the government of @entity32 prime minister @entity46			2
" this speaks clearly that @entity32 is not interested in negotiating with us			2
" but @entity32 ambassador @entity49 said it was the @entity4 who were trying to circumvent negotiations with their statehood campaign			2
" we are not against a @entity4 state , " he said			2
" the thing is how to get there			0
we should be talking with each other , not over each other			0
" @entity17 president @entity59 made the bid for the @entity0 to recognize an independent state of @entity30 on friday , a move @entity32 says is premature without direct talks that address its longstanding security concerns			1
@entity59 drew applause when he raised the document at the podium during his speech at the 66th annual session of the @entity28			0
the time has come for a " @entity72 " to join the @entity73 in reshaping the @entity74 , he said			0
" my people desire to exercise their right to enjoy a normal life like the rest of humanity			0
" but @entity46 , later taking his turn to address the @entity28 , said @entity4 are looking for a " state without peace , " ignoring security concerns important to @entity32			0
he said @entity4 are armed not only with their " hopes and dreams , " a phrase @entity59 had used in his speech , but with " 10,000 missiles , and grad rockets supplied by @entity87 , not to mention the river of lethal weapons flowing into @entity90			0
" " palestinians should first make peace with @entity32 and then get their state , " he said , adding that peace must arrive through a two - state solution that recognizes @entity32 as a jewish state			0
if that occurs , @entity32 " will be the first " to recognize @entity4 statehood , the prime minister said			0
@entity15 president @entity101 has said he supports @entity4 statehood but reiterated a longstanding @entity15 position that @entity32 must be part of the discussions			1
while a @entity15 veto would block the bid for full @entity0 membership , the @entity28 could still vote to upgrade the status of @entity4 , who currently hold the status of non-voting observer " entity			1
" the body could change that status to permanent observer " state , " identical to the @entity118 's standing at the @entity0 .			0

the @entity2 sent the application to its admissions committee
the committee is *slated* to meet friday
the @entity15 , however , has promised to veto the bid
