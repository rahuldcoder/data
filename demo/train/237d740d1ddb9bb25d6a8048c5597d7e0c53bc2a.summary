@entity0 -- the @entity2 has not effectively implemented a program designed to keep birds and other animals from causing damage to airplanes , according to an audit from the @entity9			1
the agency did not have robust inspection practices , inspectors did not have expertise in wildlife hazards , and they failed to keep adequate records of inspections , @entity10 , the assistant inspector general for aviation and special program audits , wrote			1
aircraft strike thousands of animals each year			0
in 2011 , there were 9,840 strikes -- nearly 27 a day -- recorded by the @entity2 , according to the report			1
the number is five times the number of strikes that were reported in 1990 , due in part to increasing bird populations			0
the results of a collision with wildlife often are minor but they can cause serious problems , including engine failures like those that forced @entity36 , the so - called " @entity36 , " to crash land in the river			0
twenty - four people have died in the @entity40 and 229 worldwide due to wildlife strikes since 1988 , according to the report			0
about 600,000 hours of aircraft downtime and $ 625 million in damages are caused each year by the incidents			0
next generation of supersonic flight " inspectors we spoke with mostly relied on interviews with airport personnel to determine compliance with regulatory requirements , rather than reviewing strike and airport records , " the report says			2
auditors randomly selected 40 airports and found inspectors at 21 of them " did not know whether the airports ' assessments and plans had been @entity2 reviewed and approved or whether the airports were even required to conduct an assessment or develop a plan			1
" of the 35 airports auditors looked at with @entity2 wildlife hazard assessment plans , 27 did not comply with at least one requirement despite @entity2 inspection documents showing they did			2
inspectors did not initiate enforcement actions when airports did n't follow the rules 25 times at eight of the airports visited , according to the audit			2
@entity75 googles passengers many of the policies for reporting and preventing wildlife hazards are voluntary , which the inspector general concluded limits their effectiveness			0
auditors found that one airport reported 90 % of strikes while another reported only 11 %			0
overall , only about 21 % of strikes in logs at the airports examined were reported to the @entity2			2
" without full reporting and complete data on wildlife strikes , it is difficult to fully analyze the magnitude of safety issues , the nature of the problems , and the economic cost of wildlife strikes , " the report found			1
the report suggested 10 changes to address the problems found , including mandatory and full reporting requirements as well as performing better inspections and reviews of plans			1
airlines shrink legroom in coach " it is imperative that @entity2 improve its management processes by improving oversight and enforcement of program regulations , making strike reporting mandatory , establishing performance metrics , and strengthening coordination with other governmental agencies , " the audit concluded			1
responding to the audit , the @entity2 agreed with six of the recommendations , but only partially agreed with three , and disagreed with one			1
flight returns after engine problem " @entity2 has devoted considerable effort to improving the outcomes from its work with airports and the aviation industry to reduce wildlife related hazards to aviation , " @entity124 , the @entity2 's director of audit and evaluation , wrote			2
the agency rejected the audit 's calls for mandatory and full reporting and cited a 2009 report that concluded " the current level of voluntary strike reporting is sufficient for determining national aircraft strike trends , determining the hazard level of wildlife species involved in aircraft strikes , and for providing a scientific foundation for @entity2 policies and guidance regarding the mitigation of risk from wildlife strikes			1
" top officials among those killed in @entity154 crash the @entity2 is working to gather data , expand and improve regulations , use technology to track animals , and increase training , raise awareness , he said			0
" while wildlife strikes have increased ... the percentage of significant strikes , in which multiple strikes occur simultaneously or in which an air carrier experiences a damaging collisions has decreased markedly , from 20 % of total reported strikes in 1990 , to 9 % in 2010			0
" " in our opinion , @entity2 is missing an opportunity to fully address one of its biggest challenges by not meeting the full intent of these recommendations , " the audit said			1
" accordingly , we request that the agency reconsider its position			0
