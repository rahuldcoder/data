" the arrest of @entity11 is significant , " police superintendent @entity164 said in a statement			1
" this is a victory , but we know the tentacles of his cartel still exist and much more work remains to be done			0
demand for narcotics will still remain , so we will continue to partner with the @entity23 as they fight international drug trade , and we will remain focused on our efforts to eliminate the factors that drive violence in our city			1
" from @entity182 to @entity153 , @entity183 to @entity184 , @entity11 and his lieutenants are named in indictments for marijuana , cocaine and heroin trafficking , as well as racketeering , money laundering , kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder			1
