all government shutdowns are not created equal			1
in 1995 and 1996 , disagreement over federal spending levels between the @entity4 - controlled @entity3 -- led by house speaker @entity5 -- and then - president @entity6 led the government to partially shut down twice			1
government services were cut , federal workers were furloughed and hostility toward politicians grew			2
now that a government shutdown has happened again -- this time after the @entity14 , run by @entity15 , and the @entity4 - controlled @entity16 could n't come to an agreement on funding the government by midnight on tuesday -- it would be easy to compare the two shutdowns			1
the reality : the atmosphere , the lack of negotiations between leaders and the economy were all different in 1995 , and this most recent shutdown is markedly different			1
here is why : 1			2
@entity6 and @entity28 were open to compromise during the 1995 - 1996 shutdowns , the @entity16 speaker and the president , despite their political differences , were more willing to negotiate on policy issues			1
" @entity6 and i would talk , if not every day ... we would talk five days a week before the shutdown , after the shutdowns , " said @entity28			1
" we met face to face for 35 days in the @entity16 trying to hammer things out			1
when you get to know somebody , even when you 're fighting hard , you kind of understand where the other person is coming from and they 're not some demonized figure			2
" that is not the case with president @entity50 and speaker @entity51 , whose relationship has been sullied by a number of difficult negotiations and failed deals on the budget and spending			2
they nearly reached agreement in 2011 on a " grand bargain " to deal with taxes and entitlement spending			0
but the deal fell through at the last minute and they have n't spent much time together since			1
@entity50 and @entity51 spoke monday night as the clock ticked down on government shutdown and , according to a @entity51 spokesman , " the call lasted nearly 10 minutes			0
" it was their first conversation in 10 days			0
after the call , @entity51 took to the floor and debriefed the call with the president by impersonating him			0
" i talked to the president earlier tonight : ' i 'm not going to negotiate , i 'm not going to negotiate , i 'm not going to do this , ' " @entity51 said			1
" well , i would say to the president , this is not about me			0
and it 's not about @entity4 here in @entity3			0
it 's about fairness for the @entity83 people			0
" @entity28 said this lack of contact is the problem			0
" the biggest difference i sense between the @entity50 - @entity51 relationship and the @entity6 - @entity28 relationship is just simply frequency of conversation , " @entity28 , a host of @entity88 's " @entity87 , " said on the show			1
partisanship is deeper with congressional districts that are more @entity4 or @entity15 than ever , there are few moderates left on @entity99 today			1
this has led to a more hyper - partisan @entity3 , where the parties appear to be farther apart than they ever were in the past			1
" in the ' 80s and ' 90s there was the ability for both sides , no matter how difficult the issue , to come together and arrive at compromise and solve problems , " @entity103 , assistant director of the @entity104 during the 1995 shutdown , said in an interview with @entity88			1
" now , there is such an ideological bent to many of these issues , that it is difficult to overcome the gridlock			0
" @entity103 said today 's @entity4 members , " instead of focusing on the general election where people tend to tack to the political center , are more worried about primary challenges from the far right			1
" and according to a 2013 study from @entity127 and the @entity128 , the government shutdowns of 1995 - 1996 could have led to the partisanship that is now gripping @entity130			1
although the 1995 @entity3 was the most partisan in more than 100 years , according to the study , the level of polarization since the shutdown has remained higher than it ever was before then			1
" this level of polarization could be self - reinforcing , " @entity136 of @entity127 and @entity137 of @entity128 wrote			2
" since success in middle positions requires coalitions and trust that are unlikely , given so many party loyalists			0
the economy , then and now when the government shut down in 1995 - 96 , the economy was booming , primarily because of @entity148 , the burgeoning tech sector and internet startups			1
unemployment was at 5.6 % and most economic forecasts saw further growth			0
the same could not be said for the current state of this economy			2
amid a sluggish recovery , unemployment has slowly shrunk to 7.3 % , but labor participation -- the number of people who have a job or are looking for one -- is at the lowest rate since august 1978			0
could a government shutdown damage the fragile economy ? it depends on whom you ask			2
@entity169 , chief economist for @entity170 , told @entity3 last week that economic growth would slow during a shutdown			0
but @entity173 , budget analyst for the @entity175 , told @entity88 he believes that economy would be fine during a shutdown , primarily because of how the economy performed in 1995			1
" the last time we had a government shutdown , the stock market was fine , " he said			2
" the economy was fine			2
" most economists agree , however , that the economic impact of a government shutdown depends greatly on how long the shutdown lasts			0
but according to some estimates , the a shutdown could cost the still - struggling @entity83 economy roughly $ 1 billion a week just in pay lost by furloughed federal workers			1
" if it 's a relatively short shutdown , it 's a minor headache , " said @entity192 , economist with @entity170			0
" but if it lasts several weeks , the people affected start to act like they 're unemployed			0
that 's why you start to see a significantly greater effect the longer it goes			0
" but the economic impact of an extended government shutdown will be more than just lost wages by federal workers			0
-- with national parks and museums closed , tourism will be affected			0
-- the @entity206 will be unable to process loan applications , meaning a dent in small - business growth			2
-- federal contractors would also have to cut back on staffing .			0

1995 - ' 96 shutdowns were in a politically and economically different time
those years , political leaders were more willing to negotiate
with districts more partisan , there are fewer moderates in the @entity16 today
unlike today , the mid- ' 90s economy was booming
