-- as many as 5.4 million @entity1 are living with @entity3 's disease			1
that number includes my mother - in - law , who started showing signs of the disease in 2007			0
standing beside all those living with @entity3 's are more than 15 million family members and friends who provide them with care and everyday support			1
that includes my husband , his siblings , our kids and me			0
together , we face the realities of @entity3 's disease every day			1
last week , the first @entity20 was unveiled by @entity22 secretary @entity21			0
a historic milestone , the @entity20 offers what @entity1 have never had before -- a path to change the trajectory of a devastating disease that steals people 's memories , independence and eventually their lives			2
the plan covers the spectrum of @entity3 's issues , including treatment and prevention , clinical care , support for families in their homes and communities as well as public education and engagement			1
my family is among all those who believe in the promise of the @entity20 to find a way to prevent and effectively treat the disease by 2025 and improve care today			2
this ambitious goal will require a greater national commitment to @entity3 's research			1
we 've already seen a demonstration of this in president @entity57 's @entity56 announced in february			0
it included $ 130 million in new resources for medical research in fiscal years 2012 and 2013			0
@entity3 's is a progressive , degenerative and fatal brain disease that not only affects the person with the disease , but the entire family			1
loved ones who provide care witness , day by day , the progressive and relentless realities of this fatal disease			0
@entity3 's caregivers and families go through the agony of losing a loved one twice : first to the ravaging effects of the disease and then , death			1
in addition , caregivers themselves often experience depression and worsening of health because of the intense care that a person with @entity3 's eventually requires			1
to fulfill the promise embodied in the new national @entity3 's plan , we know it must be aggressively pursued to create a future where @entity3 's disease is a manageable , treatable , curable or preventable disease			1
more than 5,000 scientists worldwide are working on solving the complex problem of @entity3 's			1
as a neuroscientist by training and a member of the medical and scientific relations team at the @entity96 , that includes me			0
we scientists know @entity3 's is a problem that can be solved			1
we know that with the right resources , we have the tools and the talent to make real , life - saving and life - enhancing progress already demonstrated in polio , heart disease , cancer and hiv / aids			0
we are already seeing signs of this progress			0
one important goal in @entity3 's research is to prevent damage and loss of brain cells by intervening early -- even before outward symptoms are evident -- because many researchers believe that once symptoms appear , slowing or stopping the disease could be too difficult or perhaps impossible			1
we know that brain changes of @entity3 's begin years before symptoms surface			1
early results from a @entity122 funded project , the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) , found that study participants inherited a gene that guarantees the onset of alzheimer 's disease at a very early age			0
one key finding is that @entity124 participants have evidence of brain chemistry changes as many as 10 years before the first detectable memory and cognitive impairment symptoms			0
this finding suggests there is a significant window of time to intervene with therapies that could halt the brain changes before they affect memory and day - to - day functioning			0
researchers in the @entity124 study also found that the brain changes among high - risk populations are very similar to the changes that happen in people who develop the more common type of @entity3 's , which affects older people			2
two important studies -- with different approaches but similar goals -- will work to speed advancements in @entity3 's treatment			2
both focus on families with younger - onset familial alzheimer 's disease , a very rare version where symptoms begin before age 65 -- but the results will also inform research questions for the more common later - onset alzheimer 's disease			2
earlier this year , the @entity96 awarded a $ 4.2 million grant to the @entity124 study to carry out a clinical trial of up to three experimental medications in the @entity1 population , called the @entity170 or @entity171			2
the @entity124 - @entity171 is expected to launch this summer and will investigate multiple drugs over a short period to determine whether they have an effect on biological markers of @entity3 's			2
drugs that demonstrate a biological effect will be followed for a longer period in a subsequent study to determine their ability to postpone or delay symptoms of @entity3 's			2
last week , the government announced that $ 16 million would be allocated to a promising five - year trial to explore whether a drug therapy delays memory decline or brain changes			0
the majority of the trial participants will come from an extended family of 5,000 who live in @entity191 , @entity192			0
many members of this family have a genetic guarantee of younger - onset familial alzheimer 's disease			0
the study will look at a single drug over a longer period to discover its efficacy			0
these scientific research efforts are just two recent examples of the thousands of projects under way worldwide that are necessary to change the scientific landscape of alzheimer 's disease and the lives of millions			2
the @entity96 is the world 's largest nonprofit funder of @entity3 's research , awarding more than $ 292 million to more than 2,000 grant proposals worldwide since 1982			1
we are encouraged by the commitment of new resources detailed in the nation 's first battle plan to fight @entity3 's			1
we will continue to invest in the innovative research opportunities that have the potential to prevent , slow or stop the development of the disease on the road to our vision of a world without @entity3 's			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0

there are 5.4 million @entity1 with @entity3 's and 15 million *caretakers*
@entity228 : @entity234 's plan is first push to find solutions to disease
*upcoming* drug trials offer promise , she says : one in @entity192 , one in @entity1
it 's crucial to keep a commitment to research , @entity243 writes
