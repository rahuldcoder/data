-- 2011 was supposed to be the year of the tablet			0
after the 2010 launch of the @entity3 demonstrated there was a lucrative market for consumer - class slates , all the key consumer electronics manufacturers strapped @entity8 to their would - be @entity3 killers , hoping to catch up to @entity12 's massive lead			1
but @entity8 tablets are n't selling			0
@entity3 still claim over 60 % of global market share , according to @entity16 research			2
as technology web site @entity19 claimed , " consumers do n't want tablets , they want @entity3			2
" and , indeed , comparably priced @entity8 competitors have n't stood up to @entity12 's two tablets			1
now there 's a new approach : aim low			2
in september , @entity25 wowed us with the unveiling of its @entity29 tablet , the first low - priced , high - quality consumer - class tablet to look like a formidable competitor to @entity3			1
even if it sucks when it finally debuts this fall , at $ 200 the @entity33 is priced low enough for casual consumers to risk an impulse buy â € ” and now we see other companies chasing that same price - conscious buyer			1
following @entity25 's lead , @entity38 teamed up with @entity41 computer company @entity40 to create the @entity42 , a sub- $ 200 tablet positioned to undercut the glut of other @entity8 slates currently shipping			1
we got some hands - on time with the @entity42 before it hits the shelves , and overall , it checks out well enough			2
i did n't expect a sub- $ 200 tablet to feel as substantial as the @entity42			1
it 's got the look of an @entity54 - made slate , with a sturdy exterior casing and smooth , brushed metal finish			2
it 's almost as if the @entity58 was revamped ( or , perhaps , copied )			0
just like the @entity33 and the @entity60 , it 's a 7 - inch tablet , deviating from the norm of 9 - and 10 - inch competitors			1
with the modest heft of a trade paperback , and the shape of one to boot , it 's comfortable to carry			0
under the hood , the @entity42 sports a 1.2 - @entity70 dual - core processor of yet - to - be - named pedigree			1
i was able to zip through @entity8 's @entity75 menus with relative ease , and regardless of whatever chip @entity40 eventually sources for the final shipping product , it 's clear that the hardware i played with was n't skimping on core processing power			0
the @entity42 comes with a few features that @entity25 's @entity33 does n't include : cameras			1
equipped with a 5 - megapixel front - facing camera and a 1.3 - megapixel back - facing camera , @entity42 adopters can snap pictures at will			1
image quality from the 5 - megapixel camera is about what you would expect ( i.e. , nothing that would compel you to ditch a dslr ) , but the very inclusion of dual cameras at least puts this tablet in the picture - taking game			1
that said , taking pictures with a tablet just feels weird			0
i 've been put off by tablet - based photography since first using the @entity104 and @entity105 -- when shooting a pic , it feels like i 'm defending myself from flying meatballs with a cafeteria tray during a food fight			0
@entity25 decided we are n't ready for cameras on tablets ( or , at least , are n't basing our buying decisions on whether cameras appear on spec sheets )			0
as both tablets have n't been released , we 'll have to wait on the market to see who 's right			0
finally , the @entity42 offers the usual array of ports -- @entity121 , micro-usb and microsd card slots ( you can use @entity125 for an extra @entity126 of storage )			0
@entity121 does n't come standard on all tablets , so it 's a nice feature			0
the @entity42 is slated to go on sale " in time for the holidays , " says @entity38 's spokeswoman , though the company is n't saying whether that means sooner rather than later			1
though we do n't know exactly how much it will cost , be prepared to spend less than two c - notes -- with a two - year @entity38 contract , of course			2

@entity38 unveils @entity42 to compete with @entity25 's @entity33 and @entity12 's @entity3
the new 7 - inch @entity146 tablet is set at a competively low price of about $ 200
it will include a 1.2 - @entity70 dual - core processor and a 5 - megapixel front - facing camera
