-- @entity1 is terrible for two kinds of people -- those who are single and those who are n't			1
for single people , the day is a disappointing reminder they do n't have that " special someone " in their life			1
not a fun feeling -- believe me , i 've been there			0
but personally i think it 's worse for people in a relationship			2
single people can choose to ignore @entity1			1
however , if you 're in a relationship , the last thing you want to do is ignore @entity1 -- believe me , i 've been there , too			1
what may have started out as a holiday intended to bring couples together has been transformed into a commercial spectacle peddled to us by florists , greeting card companies , jewelry stores and makers of stuffed animals			2
my issue is not with being romantic or expressing your feelings to the person you love			0
my issue is being required to do so on february 14			2
this date has zero connection to us			0
each year on february 14 we are in essence commanded to be " romantic			0
" should n't romance be organic -- sort of like a " @entity39 moment " ? that 's the " moment " in the tv commercials for @entity39 , the drug designed to combat erectile dysfunction -- where the couple is lifting a table together , their eyes meet , and bingo : it 's a " @entity39 moment			1
" it may be drug - enhanced , but at least they chose the moment			0
i understand that @entity1 earnestly purports to bring couples closer together			1
great idea , but let 's be honest , how many of you have had fights on @entity1 because of @entity1 ? i certainly have had my share , usually when one of us in the relationship ( namely me ) did n't buy a nice enough gift or put in enough time planning a special " @entity63 " activity -- thus , transforming @entity1 from a romantic evening for two into a scene from the film " @entity67			1
" see also : romantic restaurants with a view recently i posed this simple question on @entity71 : do you love or hate @entity1 ? i expected to find a divide by gender : men bemoaning it and women cheering it			1
but the findings of my less - than - scientific survey surprised me			0
for the most part , men were silent on the issue			0
but women not only responded in large numbers , they answered in a way i never expected : they too hate @entity1			1
overwhelmingly , women were the ones who attacked the pomp and circumstance of this " day of love			0
" here is a sampling of a few of the tweets i received from women : i hate the colors , i hate cheap chocolate , i hate the pressure it puts on couples and singles , and @entity102 are stupid if you ca n't tell me you love me with flowers or candy on any day but @entity1 , see ya around buddy to be honest i hate it cuz i dont have one ! it 's one big commercialized scheme to buy overpriced red&pink crap , i never liked it nor will i ever and then there 's this woman 's objection : i have to wear leopard lingerie although i hate it			1
ahh , the sacrifices we make for love			0
... now , it 's true that some men and women did express their support for the day			0
but they were far outnumbered by those who lamented @entity1 as artificial , contrived and absurdly overly commercialized			1
@entity1 has a muddled history			1
some historians claim it was created in 469 when @entity125 declared february 14 a day to honor @entity126			2
one legend contends that @entity126 was a @entity128 martyr executed for standing up to the roman emperor who wanted to ban soldiers from getting married			0
yet another tale claims he was executed because of his @entity128 beliefs and signed his farewell note to his beloved : " from your @entity135			0
" while a third and more accepted belief is that the holiday marks the day that " birds begin to pair , " which is the day they choose their mate			2
so somehow because birds picked february 14 to " get it on , " i have to spend $ 100 on roses ? this tweet best sums up my sentiments : why program couples into thinking feb 14 is the only day they can express their feelings to 1 another ? i would love to organize an " @entity152 " movement			2
we would hold protests outside flower shops , @entity157 chocolate factories and @entity159 stores			0
the protests would continue until these businesses stop bombarding us with commercials or until @entity1 is moved -- from february 14 to february 29 so that we are only compelled to observe it once every four years			1
join the conversation on @entity165			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

@entity168 : romance is great , but it should n't be compulsory on one day
he says @entity1 is tough for those who are not in a relationship
and for those who are in a relationship , *handling* @entity1 is tricky , too , he says
@entity168 : move the holiday to february 29 , so it only comes once every four years
