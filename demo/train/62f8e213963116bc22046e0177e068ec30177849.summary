chief operating officer @entity11 said in a video posted on the company 's blog and its @entity15 that the airline had six flights divert to @entity9 during the freak weekend snowstorm " due to various runway , congestion and other operational issues at @entity23 and @entity24 " and that the airline " did not deplane those aircraft in our target time allotted			1

" @entity11 said the airline intends to " fully participate with the @entity46 and cooperating with their investigation into events over the weekend , and we 're also going to conduct an internal evaluation so that we can learn from this event because at the end of the day , you deserve better -- and we expect better from our crewmembers and our operation			1
" " we can only earn your loyalty and trust one flight at a time and we ask you to give us a second chance			1
" @entity60 504 departed @entity29 at 10:07 a.m. et saturday -- 32 minutes late			2
the flight made it to @entity23 -- just not to the runway , thanks to the weather before it was diverted to @entity9			1
it landed at 1:07 p.m. what came next was an eight - hour ordeal for passengers -- and crew -- as the plane sat stuck on the tarmac with little food or water			1
" i got a problem here on the airplane			2
i 'm going to need to have the cops onboard , " a flight crew member told the tower in a conversation posted on liveatc.net , a website that monitors air traffic control conversations			0
" i need some air stairs brought over here and the cops brought onboard the airplane			0
" passenger @entity88 explained the situation in a phone interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity92 from the plane			0

" we can not go to the bathrooms anymore			0
there 's no running water , " said @entity101 , another passenger			0
" they tell us that we 're going to be going in soon , going in soon , going in soon -- and it just never happens			0
" adding to the frustration and tension were passengers with medical conditions			1
" i have a paraplegic that needs to come off , " the pilot said			2
" i have a diabetic here that 's got an issue ... i 've just got to get some help			0
" but the plane was still not at a gate , further frustrating the pilot			2
" look , you know , we ca n't seem to get any help from our own company , " the pilot told the tower			2
" i apologize for this , but if there is any way you can get a tug and a tow bar out here to us and get us towed somewhere to a gate or something			0
i do n't care , take us anywhere			0
" the pilot , though frustrated , offered thanks to @entity8 officials			2
" listen , i just want to put in my two cents worth in for whatever it worth			0
thank you very much , " he said			0
" it 's capt. @entity141 over here on ( flight ) 504 ... i think we 've got more help from you guys than our own people			0
