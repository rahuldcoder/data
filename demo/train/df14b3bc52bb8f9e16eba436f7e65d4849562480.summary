@entity0 , @entity1 -- at its best , driving in @entity3 is like driving backward into a parade			1
so , when my lady and i set out for the airport during rush hour , getting choked in traffic was inevitable			1
yet , a quarter - mile later , we were still moving at a brisk clip			1
which brings me to one of my cardinal rules of travel : think inside the box			2
here 's how it works : when traveling during peak travel times -- @entity21 , spring break , even for the weekend -- schedule your journey at the most " inconvenient " time			2
this is because despite what we 've learned from reality television , @entity25 are n't nutjobs			2
they think outside the box			2
they tweak their schedules to avoid the big rush			2
they leave a day early or catch the red - eye			1
which means peak times can be easy sailing			2
" so this ' think inside the box ' philosophy has nothing to do with the fact that you waited to the last minute to buy tickets ? " my girlfriend said , peering over a limp piece of airport pizza			2
it was part of my plan all along			2
" " kinda like your ' famous ' burnt broccoli recipe			2
" and away we went to @entity0 , @entity1 , the former mining town , the schmancy ski resort , the home of the @entity56			1
like many @entity59 ski towns , @entity0 's vibe is part snowhemian , part @entity61			1
you can window shop for things you ca n't afford and then crack wise about it at the local independent coffee shop			2
over-the - counter culture in @entity68 oh , and there 's skiing			1
my girlfriend 's family , who was hosting us , hails from @entity76 , so they 're as comfortable with powder under their skis as they are with sand between their toes			2
me ? i grew up outside @entity85			2
so when i think " downhill , " i think school systems			0
accordingly , instead of skis , i brought three books and " @entity92 / @entity91 " double - feature dvd			1
as it turns out , i used these things exactly never			0
is skiing something one should start doing in one 's 30s ? does it make sense to start testing my body now , after decades in which playing cards was the height of my athletic activity ? these questions ran through my mind , as well as this great @entity25 paradox : now that i 'm old enough to afford health insurance , i 'm old enough to know that hurdling down a mountain on two slick sticks makes as much sense as strapping acoustic guitars to my feet and jumping off a roof			0
@entity114 : cheap thrills with an old flame " you skiing ? " my girlfriend asked			0
" i think i 'll hang here and practice sleeping , " i said			0
" if you do n't come skiing , you 'll miss ' après - ski			1
' " " what 's that ? " " it 's like a post-ski happy hour where you sit in front of a fire and drink cocktails and relax			1
" " well , i 've always thought mountains looked cool in pictures , " i said , grabbing my parka and heading to the door			0
so convinced of skiing 's addictive power , the resorts in @entity0 offer a special lesson / ski lift package for first - time skiers			1
thus , before i knew it , i was on top of a frozen mountain , feet in boots the size of @entity146 , trying to decipher my instructor 's @entity148 accent through multiple layers of polar fleece			0
" does ' après - ski ' really require this much ' ski ' ? " i wondered but soon , i was zigzagging around the slopes like an old pro. and when i say " old , " i mean nonagenarian			1
i went very , very slowly , and despite the occasional 10 - year - old using my crumpled body as a mogul , i made it through the day with little more than a bruised ego			1
but , man , did i excel at après - ski			1
we parked ourselves at @entity164 , a handsome whiskey distillery , restaurant and saloon built in a turn - of - the - century house and livery stable on the edge of town			1
within minutes , we were slaloming between gooey fondue bites and sips of house whiskey			1
we then moved up the street to @entity177 's @entity176 , where we ate prime rib the size of trash can lids			1
that night , my legs throbbed like two lighthouse lights , and i dreamed that i was on a ski lift traversing a giant lake of molten cheese			1
for our last day , we decided to give our knees and wallets a rest			1
we packed a picnic and went for a drive			0
while surveying the tony @entity191 , we glimpsed the new @entity192 and decided to investigate			0
is it ok to have a crush on a funicular ? because i do			0
picture a roomy elevator with leather banquettes and windows that frame a panoramic view of the breathtaking @entity200			0
it 's the only way the public can visit the @entity192 resort , and that 's fine by me			0
the funicular opens up onto the lobby of a posh grill owned and operated by famed chef @entity208			0
once at the top , my girlfriend and i were eager to hike			0
she along a snowy elk trail that necklaced the valley			0
me from the funicular to the bar			0
the bloody mary as we know it was invented at the original @entity192 in @entity114 in 1934 , the hotel claims			0
in honor of that brunch - changing event , every @entity192 has its own signature version of the drink			1
the @entity0 version uses local vodka and wears a green cap of wasabi and celery mousse			1
but the coup de grace is a squeeze - bulb stir - stick filled with a @entity232 / @entity231 sauce blend that lets you regulate the spiciness of your drink			1
it looks kind of like an iv , which is appropriate for a cocktail that people normally start consuming first thing in the morning			0
i was content in my après - après - ski state			1
" you know , instead of covertly eating our picnic , it would be easier if we just ordered lunch here , " i said , eyeing a hanger steak being delivered to a nearby table			0
" yeah , but we already have the leftovers , " my girlfriend said , patting the @entity253 boxes carrying our premade lunch			0
" you said yourself that you did n't want to get suckered into paying for another overpriced meal in a tourist town			0
this way , we can admire the view and save money			0
" " i know , i know			0
but maybe we should think outside the box on this one , " i said , licking my wasabi and celery foam mustache .			0

the after - ski *social* hour is a true reward for the half - *hearted* skier
@entity0 , @entity1 , is a picturesque base of après - ski operations
prime rib and locally distilled whiskey hit the spot after a day on the slopes
