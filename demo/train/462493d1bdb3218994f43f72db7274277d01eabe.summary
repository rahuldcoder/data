-- ahead of the first grand slam tournament of the year , the @entity2 , defending champion @entity1 has exclusively told @entity0 's @entity4 that his rivalry with @entity6 is only on the tennis court -- and the pair are good friends when the action stops			1
" some people might think that it 's strange			1
some other people think its great and it 's actually really nice for the sport , " @entity1 said			1
" in the past , maybe there have been much tougher and harsher rivalries			0
people would n't talk to each other , they did n't like each other and they needed to hate each other to actually perform well against each other			0
but it does n't need to be that way , " he added			0
fierce competition with the @entity29 has not only made both of them better players , @entity1 says , but also forged a stronger bond between them			2
at the end of last year , @entity6 accepted the @entity35 's invitation to play in the " @entity36 " in @entity37 for the @entity38 which funds child development in @entity40			1
@entity1 aims to help @entity42 flood victims the @entity43 won that battle , although @entity6 evened things up when the two faced each other in @entity47			1
and @entity1 has carried the good form he showed at the end of 2010 into the new year , already winning the @entity50 in @entity51 for the third time in his career			1
@entity1 and @entity6 did not face each other in the gulf state , but their paths have crossed 22 times since 2004 , with @entity6 currently leading the head - to - head 14 victories to eight			1
@entity1 is now turning his attention to the @entity2 in @entity61 , but admits to feeling a few nerves heading into the tournament			1
should tennis follow football 's lead ? " there 's a bit of pressure being the defending champion , but i love going down to @entity42 ; it 's a wonderful place to play tennis			2
" in the off season i practiced really well , so i feel very confident going into the tournament , " @entity1 added			2
@entity1 's resurgence in form has also given his critics food for thought , with some commentators believing that the 29 - year - old 's best days were firmly behind him			1
" it is n't the first time that i have been written off			0
it happened when @entity6 took the number one spot a couple of years ago , " continued @entity1			1
" but i was able to snatch it back and then people were questioning @entity6 when he went nine months without winning a tournament			2
" it 's disappointing that people have short memories			0
even after everything you have done there are those who write you off so quickly			0
" it 's frustrating to say the least			0
you walk into press conferences and there is a negative tone in there , when really there is nothing to be negative about			0
" sometimes , i am beaten simply because my opponent has played better than me , but often that fact is n't respected which i do n't think is fair			0
" in addition to his regular backroom team -- which includes the @entity107 captain @entity106 -- @entity1 will also draw on the experience of renowned coach @entity109 , who he recruited in august last year and has overseen a definite upsurge in @entity1 's performances			1
@entity1 to link up with coach @entity112 " i just thought it would be nice to get someone else into my team who comes in with huge experience and comes from a different angle , " he said			2
so what has @entity1 learnt from @entity121 , a man who coached @entity122 for six years			0
" he 's obviously told me to play more aggressive , because i did have a tendency to start chipping the backhand return into play just getting the rally started			0
" so we 've been working on a few key little areas and they seemed to have worked ... "			0

@entity1 and @entity6 share a rivalry on court , but also a friendship off it
*sixteen* - time grand slam champion says some people might find friendship strange but it 's good for tennis
@entity1 starts defense of @entity2 title in @entity61 this month
new coach @entity109 has urged @entity1 to be more aggressive
