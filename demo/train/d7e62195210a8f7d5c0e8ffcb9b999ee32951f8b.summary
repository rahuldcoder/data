-- " i believe that we will win ! " the refrain is consistently chanted by the @entity3 , the supporters group for the @entity6 national soccer team , and it now rings truer than ever			1
we were n't supposed to win			1
the opening match of the @entity9 against @entity10 was a must - win for the @entity6 team -- anything short of a victory , and the red , white and blue would have faced a seemingly insurmountable hill to climb			1
the @entity6 were given little chance of winning against their nemesis , @entity10			1
the team from @entity20 had beaten the @entity6 twice before in the @entity9 -- knocking it out of contention in 2010 as well as four years earlier			1
this time was supposed to be no different			0
everything pointed toward the @entity6 wilting in the @entity28 humidity			2
we were n't supposed to win			1
@entity6 do n't follow the world 's script			1
rising to the world 's stage from vastly different backgrounds , these @entity6 stayed united -- symbolic of our great nation			1
when adversity struck , they battled			0
they won with typical @entity6 character and diversity			2
monday 's victory sets the stage for a major match sunday against @entity42 -- which @entity43 downed 4 - 0			1
the winner will be one step closer to the @entity46			0
but it really confirmed to the rest of the world that @entity6 football ( ok , we also call it soccer ) will not go gently into that good night			2
in the end , two @entity6 heroes of completely different backgrounds provided the scoring punch that stunned @entity10			1
@entity58 , born in @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 , born in @entity62			0
@entity58 is a player we are proud to have wear the @entity65 kit , and @entity61 is an up - and - comer in the @entity68 @entity67 -- or football league -- with @entity70			0
@entity58 , the 31 - year - old captain , is playing in his third @entity9 , while @entity61 , the 21 - year - old newcomer , is making his competitive debut as an emergency substitute			2
@entity58 played the creative genius for a workmanlike @entity6 team , and @entity61 stood tall as a powerful 6 - foot - 4 defender			1
their goals were reflective of their personality			0
@entity58 brilliantly allowed the ball to pass through his legs on his way to three wicked touches with his right foot , setting up his left peg for a drive to the far post just 29 seconds into the match			0
then , loping forward on a late corner kick , @entity61 rose above the @entity90 defense to drive his header low and hard , just out of the reach of the goalkeeper in the 86th minute			0
as the final whistle blew , the reactions were priceless			0
players born in all corners of the @entity6 celebrated with their teammates from @entity99 , @entity43 and @entity100			2
@entity68 - born head coach @entity101 embraced his @entity103 assistant coach , @entity102			0
some 20,000 fans who traveled to @entity28 from the @entity6 sang and danced in excitement			2
and tens of millions of @entity6 back home watched the whole scene unfold , evoking national pride for the greatest melting pot on @entity110			2
the victory was perfectly @entity112			1
it was @entity6 diversity coming together for a common goal			2
it was a team , cobbled together over the past three years , which had a singular focus on beating @entity10			1
the @entity9 has just begun for the @entity6			1
and there is much work left to do			0
but a soccer nation back home in the @entity6 is energized , emboldened , hopeful			0
with old - fashioned @entity6 character and ingenuity , the @entity6 national team is poised to do great things in @entity28			1
just one game into the tournament , and the country is captivated			0
@entity6 can relate to this group of soccer players , whose diversity and spirit is akin to that of their supporters			0
" i believe that we will win ! " and we will do it the @entity141			0
you see , we were n't supposed to win			1
join us on @entity144 / @entity143 .			0

@entity146 says the @entity6 team was n't supposed to beat @entity10 at @entity9 but did
he says victory *filled* with grit , determination , mental toughness -- perfectly @entity112
