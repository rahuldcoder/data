" here we go again , " i sigh , browsing news channels			2
each one , leading with the chilling buzzwords : " @entity4 " and " @entity5			2
" not since the weeks following the september 11 , 2001 attacks in @entity7 has turning on the tv been so demoralizing for @entity9 across the globe			1
i have that same sinking feeling whenever an atrocity takes place which is broadly placed at the feet of the " muslim world			2
" because , " hi , i am @entity16 and i am a muslim " -- should there be a new support group ? what 's depressing as a " revert " ( @entity9 believe everyone is born into their faith ) to @entity22 is to witness the casual sleepwalk towards the branding of all @entity9 -- wherever we live and whatever our lives -- as the " same			1
" as the wider community watches this dangerous pantomime unfold , it is significant that the question asked ( again ) of @entity31 or @entity32 is not : " how do we tackle these challenges together ? " but " what can be done about ' extremism ' in your community ? " this question pushes millions of us outside mainstream society , causing fissures where fault lines already exist			2
almost a decade ago , as the ( @entity45 ) head interviewer at the @entity46 in the @entity47 , my job put me into contact with some of the @entity0 world 's most prominent clerics , academics and leaders			1
my contact with many chilled - out , clean - living and gentle people -- offering me kindness , food and shelter -- led me to research the world 's fastest growing faith			1
i came to embrace its central concept : the " oneness of @entity63			0
" during this time , i also visited @entity64 as a reporter			0
my working life in the @entity68 media had not prepared me for the experience			0
i realized that i had been misguided about @entity22 and its people by the political mantra , best summarized as : " you 're either with us or against us			0
" one day , reporting from a refugee camp in @entity75 , i was led by a group of shoeless children to a dark living room , lit only by candles due to a power cut			0
an elderly lady offered me tea and i found myself alone with a short - bearded young man in jeans and a t - shirt , with a serious expression			1
" you are now in the house of @entity90 , " he said			0
my eyes took in the impoverished home			0
my hair was out , my arms on show , and i was in my usual @entity97 - style clothes			1
" why are n't you afraid ? " the young man asked			0
" because your mum 's making me tea , " i said			1
he went on to tell me that whether i was @entity45 , @entity32 , secular or @entity104 , so long as i came to @entity64 in peace , he and his colleagues would protect me with their lives and treat me ( the sister in law of @entity109 , former @entity47 prime minister -- no friend of @entity22 ) as their honored guest			2
for the best part of a decade , this has remained my professional experience			0
i have also interviewed members of @entity116 , @entity117 and the @entity118			0
the men i met expressed the same promise to protect my safety			0
that particular young man in @entity75 would no more recognize the aims or behavior of the so - called " @entity4 , " in beheading journalists and threatening the mass murder of other faiths , than your own kids or , for that matter , your average @entity0 teenager in @entity132 , @entity97 or @entity133 would			2
yet @entity9 -- whether involved in genuine armed resistance in @entity75 or simply preparing for college in the @entity136 -- are labeled as sharing the values of groups i can confidently say do not represent our faith , our many cultures , or much less our hopes and aspirations			1
in response to @entity147 prime minister @entity146 's attempt to link all resistance groups ' aims to those of @entity151 , @entity152 in @entity64 aired a film clip that better reflects the way @entity151 is viewed by most @entity9 in the region			1
it is pertinent to remind ourselves that despite the abject horror of @entity68 journalists being murdered , @entity151 , like all extremist jihadist groups , has focused its killing on @entity9 first and foremost			1
the @entity162 ( 2012 ) found that " in cases where the religious affiliation of terrorism casualties could be determined , @entity9 suffered between 82 and 97 % of terrorism - related fatalities over the past five years			1
" so , do you really think we do n't care about extremism ? that it 's divorced from our reality , or unimportant to our community ? there is an experience that wannabe members of chilling @entity176 offshoots and people like me share : the inevitable hurried , ill - thought out policy - on - the - run that politicians in the @entity32 , @entity47 and @entity181 will now make off the back of the regular appearance of murder videos			1
every day , muslims in market places from @entity187 to @entity188 are more likely to be blown up by " jihadists			2
" and in the @entity191 , it is everyday muslims like me who hold our breaths waiting for the next raft of @entity197 and @entity47 intelligence " measures , " which will target citizens based solely on the basis of our religion or ethnicity			2
in the @entity32 , databases showing where @entity9 live , where we shop , what internet cafes we use and even where we like to watch sport are now accepted practices			1
informants -- aptly nicknamed " mosque crawlers " by the @entity197 -- are sent to our friday services , pretending to share our faith , then reporting back to the secret service			2
unsurprisingly as a result , government bodies are viewed as a hostile entity by @entity0 voters who are not radicalized -- simply frustrated			0
a 2012 survey by the @entity220 found that 55 % of @entity9 experienced discrimination , while 71 % were afraid of expected future increases in discrimination			1
meanwhile in @entity47 , as prime minister @entity226 grandstands using phrases that inflame tensions on the streets here , mosques have been burned and vandalized			0
@entity9 are the target of countless and increasing hate crimes across cities in the @entity47 and @entity234			1
those headlines -- the ones that may reassure you -- about " deradicalization " and " crackdowns , " mean that your quiet , non-drinking @entity0 neighbors and i must now prepare for more phone spying , more friends receiving alarming visits from secret agents and more hassle at the airport			0
for those young men whose inner confusion , drug addiction , mental health problems or yes , even extremist grooming , makes them want to join some murderous group , one of the biggest recruiting lines is " the @entity191 vilifies you and your community			2
" so why do politicians think more mass surveillance and persecution is the answer ? one ingredient for a long - term solution to the brainwashing of a small number of young people is one that is missing from this week 's political rhetoric -- yet again			1
this is the ideal of " fairness , " at home and abroad , for @entity9			1
this may be shocking to read at a time when " muslims " are shown wearing bonnets and carrying long knives for slaughter videos			1
yet the answer is staring us all in the face and has been since 9/11 first made @entity9 in the @entity191 afraid to turn on the tv			1
millions felt the same horror watching footage of @entity285 and @entity286			0
are we all humans with rights or are we not ? the @entity32 and its allies are preparing to re-enter @entity290 again by air and perhaps eventually by land			0
now is the time to propose a coherent strategy abroad that does not , and will never again , name the mass slaughter of @entity0 civilians as " collateral damage " in a war they want no part in			0
a strategy should be proposed at home that includes honest , free debate between the @entity0 community and the government on issues such as foreign policy and anti-terror measures , without prompting fear for our own freedom and security			0
now that really would be radical			0
@entity316 : where do jihadis come from ?			0

it 's depressing to witness the branding of all @entity9 as the " same , " **writes** @entity322
@entity324 : muslims are labeled as sharing the values of groups that do not represent our faith
extremist jihadist groups have focused its killing on @entity9 first and foremost , she **writes**
one ingredient for a long - term solution is the ideal of " fairness , " she says
