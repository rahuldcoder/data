soccer 's world governing body expects the 2018 @entity3 to be a catalyst for social change in @entity6 , despite apparently anti-gay statements by the head of the organizing committee			1
but @entity10 told @entity11 tuesday that it was seeking clarification on the adoption of new laws in @entity6 which " prohibit propaganda on non-traditional sexual relations " around minors			1
the legislation also bans symbols symbols such as rainbow flags and has led to calls for the @entity22 and the 2018 @entity3 to be boycotted			1
@entity23 , ceo of the latter competition , defended the new laws , saying they had been misinterpreted			0
" it is designed against active propaganda of homosexuality , not against homosexuality itself			0
that is a big difference , " he was quoted in an article by @entity33			0
" would you like a @entity3 where naked people are running around displaying their homosexuality ? the answer to that is quite obvious			2
" " the @entity41 and @entity3 are not a stage for various views -- not for @entity44 , not for any other ways of life			1
it should be about football and nothing else			0
" @entity10 said that its statutes had " zero tolerance against discrimination based , among other , on sexual orientation " and trusted that the 2018 hosts would deliver on their promise to provide all visitors and fans with a warm welcome			2
" @entity10 is firmly convinced that the staging of the @entity3 can contribute to uniting people and having a positive social impact , " it added			1
the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , under pressure to act ahead of next year 's @entity64 , has publicly opposed any moves to stage boycotts , but told @entity11 it is keeping a watching brief on developments in @entity6			2
" this legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented , particularly as regards the @entity70 in @entity71 , " it said			0
" to that end , the @entity62 has received assurances from the highest level of government in @entity6 that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the @entity70			0
" @entity6 won the right to host the 2018 @entity3 at a vote in december 2010 and pledged to build 13 new stadiums as part of a near $ 5 billion plan			1
billions will also be spent on improving infrastructure for the expected influx of tourists and football fans for the global competition .			0
