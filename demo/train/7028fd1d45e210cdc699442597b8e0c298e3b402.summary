-- some years ago i was the municipal prosecutor in a midsize @entity3 town			1
i had weekly " night court " duties , where we handled traffic violations , duis and other nonfelonies			0
i can say without reservation that during the years i worked as a prosecutor , i held the police in the highest regard and greatly trusted them			1
i felt this way for years after i stopped prosecuting			0
but those feelings are gone			0
do n't get me wrong , i do n't view the police as the enemy			1
i simply do n't trust them like i once did			1
i no longer give them the benefit of the doubt , meaning i can now just as easily believe the suspect 's version of the facts as the police officers			1
and i can easily believe allegations of police misconduct			1
and here 's what @entity31 police union leader @entity29 and others like him in the @entity33 do n't get : i 'm not the exception			1
in fact , my views about police put me in the company of a growing number of @entity41			1
a @entity43 poll released a few weeks ago found that 48 % of @entity41 view the police as possessing high or very high levels of honesty and ethics			2
that number is not only down 6 percentage points from 2013 , it 's the lowest in almost 20 years			0
in contrast , 68 % of @entity41 viewed the police as possessing high levels of honesty and ethics in 2001			2
that 's an astounding 20 - point drop in 13 years			2
to me , these falling poll numbers are tied , at least in part , to a case like @entity57 , the unarmed man placed in a chokehold by a @entity31 officer and who died a short time later			1
a recent poll found that 57 % of @entity41 believed that the grand jury had made a mistake in failing to indict the officer who had choked @entity57 , with only 22 % agreeing with the grand jury 's decision			1
it 's with that 22 % of people where @entity29 , president of the @entity31 @entity69 , and his compatriots stand			0
indeed , after the grand decision was announced a few weeks ago , @entity29 made matters worse with two tone - deaf comments			1
first , he seemingly blamed @entity57 for his own death with the remark , " @entity57 made a choice that day to resist arrest			1
" he then shockingly added that @entity57 's death is a " tragedy for this police officer who has to live with that death			1
" a tragedy for the police officer ? ! the police officer is alive			2
yet to @entity29 , we should have sympathy for the police officer who most of us believe should be facing criminal charges for homicide			2
and @entity29 has not let up in his apparent efforts to drive a wedge between the public and the @entity33			0
on saturday night , shortly after we learned of the horrific slayings of two @entity31 police officers at the hands of a man who reportedly said he wanted to avenge the deaths of @entity57 and @entity99 , @entity29 released one of the most irresponsible statements i 've ever heard from a person in his position			1
@entity29 said there 's " blood on many hands " in the cop killings			0
first , he blamed @entity31 mayor @entity109 -- who has in the past been slightly critical of certain of the department 's actions -- saying that the " blood on the hands starts on the steps of @entity115 in the office of the mayor			0
" ( the @entity33 's @entity118 echoed @entity29 's sentiment			0
) then @entity29 blamed the recent protesters who had taken to the streets to denounce the grand jury decision in the @entity57 case			1
just so it 's clear , a small number of protesters did -- despicably -- chant , " what do we want ? dead cops			0
" but it 's outlandish to blame the protesters for the actions of a man with a long criminal record who had shot his girlfriend only hours before killing the police officers			2
@entity29 's comments sounded like a politician using a tragedy to score political points			2
in fact , former @entity31 gov. @entity141 , a @entity142 who is said to be considering a presidential run in 2016 , made comments similar to @entity29 's via @entity147 , where he blamed @entity109 for the tragedy			2
@entity29 is missing the big picture			0
sure , for politicians such as @entity141 , pandering to the base is the norm			0
but the leader of a union that represents more than 34,000 uniformed officers charged with protecting and serving the public needs to be better than offering up red meat to his supporters			0
@entity29 is viewed by many as the spokesman for rank - and - file @entity33 officers			0
consequently , his remarks could result in an even fewer @entity41 viewing the police in a favorable light			0
that does not bode well for us a nation			0
if we collectively view the police as an untrustworthy adversary and not an ally , it undermines the very notion of community - based policing that is the cornerstone to effective policing			1
the question is : will @entity29 and his supporters change their tune , or will they make matters worse ?			0

when he was a prosecutor , @entity181 trusted police ; like many now , he does not
polls show sharp drop in trust in police ; in one , *majority* *disagrees* with @entity57 grand jury
he says comments of police union head *antagonize* , damage relations with *citizens*
@entity181 : if trust in police is *damaged* , so is cornerstone of community policing
