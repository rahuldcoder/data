you read the headline right			0
we are so used to the constant flow of bad news from much of the @entity8 world that it 's hard to get your head around the good news when things go right somewhere like @entity13			1
consider that the @entity13 have done exactly what the feckless and irresponsible @entity15 government failed to do during the past several years			1
on monday @entity13 formed a " national unity government " with the once - bitter rivals dr. @entity19 , taking the role of president and dr. @entity22 taking the role of chief executive officer ; similar , it is envisioned , to a prime ministerial role			1
what makes this all the more important is that @entity19 is identified with the @entity29 , the largest ethnic group in @entity13 , while @entity22 is identified with the sizable @entity32 ethnic group			0
this is precisely the opposite of what the government of @entity35 did in @entity15 , which ruled as a @entity38 chauvinist party and excluded @entity39 from positions of any power or influence			1
tuesday , the day after @entity19 and @entity22 were inaugurated , they signed the @entity44 , which allows 9,800 @entity46 troops to remain in @entity13 after @entity48 combat operations cease at the end of december			2
again , this is exactly the opposite of what happened in @entity15 where the @entity15 would not sign a similar basing agreement with the @entity46			1
as a result , almost all @entity46 troops left the country in december 2011			0
the result of @entity35 's decision to exclude the @entity39 from any form of power meant that many @entity39 passively or actively supported @entity60 , which is now almost at the gates of @entity62			0
and , largely as a result of the rise of @entity60 , between june and september , 5,500 @entity15 civilians were killed , according to the @entity66			0
by contrast , 3,000 civilians were killed in the @entity69 in 2013			0
@entity13 and @entity15 have roughly the same size populations , which therefore makes @entity15 today about eight times more violent than @entity13			2
the signing of the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) is important not only because it allows thousands of @entity46 soldiers to remain in @entity13 as well as a smaller number of troops from other @entity48 countries , but also because it will restore the confidence of the business community in @entity13			0
former @entity13 president @entity80 's stubborn refusal to sign the @entity44 for many months had contributed to an atmosphere of uncertainty in the country , which had damaged the @entity13 economy significantly			1
what would make the situation in @entity13 change even more for the better is if the leading contenders in the @entity46 presidential race added into their platforms a pledge to extend the @entity46 military presence in @entity13 past december 2016			1
president @entity94 's decision to pull out all @entity46 troops from @entity13 two years from now does not bind whoever wins the 2016 presidential campaign			2
after all , at considerable @entity46 and @entity13 government effort , a @entity98 has already been negotiated between the two countries that runs until at least 2024 and that would easily provide the basis for a longer term troop commitment			2
many @entity13 wants some kind of long - term @entity46 military presence in their country as a guarantor of their stability			1
they only need to look at the carnage in @entity15 to remind themselves that the model they want to emulate is @entity113 with its decades - long @entity46 military presence , not @entity15			2
at the end of the @entity113 war in 1953 @entity113 was one of the poorest countries in the world ; now , under an @entity46 security umbrella , it is one of the richest			0
and the appearance of @entity60 - like @entity125 militias in @entity13 over the past week who have beheaded 15 @entity13 civilians is a reminder to @entity13 and @entity46 and alike that they have a long - term strategic interest in preventing @entity13 from becoming a safe haven for terrorists again .			0

amid all the bad news , there 's a sign of *progress* in @entity13 , says @entity137
@entity139 : a national unity government has agreed to a continuing @entity46 presence
he says @entity13 leaders are making calls opposite to what @entity15 's @entity35 did
@entity139 : @entity13 's economy could benefit from signs of greater stability
