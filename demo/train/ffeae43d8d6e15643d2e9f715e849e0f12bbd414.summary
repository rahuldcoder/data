-- a man who wrote a controversial book considered a " how - to " guide for pedophiles was booked into a @entity6 jail tuesday after defending his book to reporters			1
@entity9 , who was arrested monday in @entity10 , said " @entity11 to love and pleasure : a @entity20 's @entity19 " can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles , and -- instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest -- teaches them to avoid illegal actions			1
asked if he is a pedophile , @entity9 said , " i only have sex with grown - ups			1
" he said he has no children and " i do n't keep children around my house			0
" @entity26 , @entity6 , sheriff @entity27 has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation , buying the book through the mail			1
@entity9 protested tuesday he is the target of entrapment , but @entity27 disagreed			1
" he wrote this book , he published this book , he put it on @entity44 to sell , " @entity27 told reporters as @entity9 was booked into the @entity37 , " and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it			1
" @entity9 and his book gained national attention this year after @entity44 defended selling the book despite angry comments and threats of boycotts			1
the book was removed from the website in november			2
officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children , grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents			2
@entity27 said @entity64 ' book outlines a " code of ethics " that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children			2
@entity9 told reporters tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood			1
he said he was introduced to sex at age 7 by a 10 - year - old friend and began having sex with other children			0
it continued , he said , until he was about 15 when he stopped and did not have sex again for years			0
" once i got into adolescence , i suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile , " he said			0
but now , he said , he is an example of the fact that people can reform			0
" i think all speech should be protected , " @entity9 said			1
but " i was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to @entity6			1
i think @entity6 law is for @entity88 and @entity10 law is for @entity90			1
" he told reporters he will not be able to make bond : " i 'm actually quite poor			2
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity93 said on @entity0 's " 360 Â° " on monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting @entity64 and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional			2
" i do n't think they can go forward because the book is clearly protected by the @entity99 , " @entity93 said			2
" this book , as awful as it is , it is only words			0
" @entity27 vehemently disagreed with @entity93 's assessment of the case			0
" this has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity , " @entity27 said			0
" we had a law in @entity6 that applied			1
" he said the book violates @entity6 law			1
" there 's too much hand - wringing across the nation			0
when we ca n't stand together as a nation and say you ca n't write a book with real stories of children being sexually abused , then it 's time to change the law			0
" @entity27 said of @entity9 : " clearly , in our opinion , he 's a pedophile			1
... the guy is clearly trying to instruct people how to sexually abuse children , a step - by - step instruction guide with real - life examples			0
that 's against the obscenity law in @entity6 , and we 're excited to take it to court			2
" referring to @entity93 's comments about the book being just words , he said , " words become actions , and words in and of themselves can get you in trouble			0
if you threaten the president , you 're in trouble			0
... there are limits to what you can do			0
" he said prosecutors and a circuit judge signed off on the arrest			0
@entity93 pointed to a similar case that went to the @entity156 in 2002 in which cartoons depicting children in acts similar to ones in @entity9 ' book were deemed protected by the @entity163			1
" certainly the sheriff and i disagree about the constitutional issue , but i agree with him that the issue of child pornography is a very serious one , and i 'm certainly glad that law enforcement is taking an active stand against it , " @entity93 said .			0
