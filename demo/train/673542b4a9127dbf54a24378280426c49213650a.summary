editor 's note : @entity2 is the co-founder of the @entity3 and author of " spiritual solutions : answers to @entity10 's @entity9 " , reveals how to find our inner strength			1
( @entity11 ) -- in an ideal world , the title of this article would be " 5 ways to feel more powerful			2
" but as things stand , many people feel powerless , and the social trends that drain personal power only grow stronger			1
whether you struggle due to the recession , a controlling spouse , or the anonymity of routine work , it 's crucial to find a way to limit that feeling in your day - to - day life			1
before talking about power , let 's clarify what power is n't			1
it is n't a force that you use like a weapon to get your own way			2
it is n't a suppression of what you do n't like about yourself to achieve a perfect ideal that does n't exist in the first place			2
it is n't money , status , possessions , or any other material surrogate			2
there are countless people sitting in the lap of luxury who feel even more powerless than the average person does			2
this is so because the issues of power are all " in here , " where you relate to yourself			1
now we can address the five things that help conquer that feeling of powerlessness			2
@entity11 : the 4 - step plan to get your life on track 1			1
stop giving away your power			1
becoming powerless does n't happen in a single dramatic stroke , like the barbarian hordes breaking down your door and burning your house			2
it 's a process , and for most people , the process is so gradual that they do n't notice it			1
they are more than happy , in fact , to give away their power by degrees			1
why ? because being powerless seems like an easy way to be popular , accepted , and protected			2
thus you are giving away your power when you please others in order to fit in			1
or when you follow the opinions of the crowd			2
or when you decide that others matter more than you do			2
or when you let someone who seems to have more power take charge of you			1
it can often seem right -- or proper -- o sit modestly in the background , holding accepted opinions , living for your children , or letting a controlling spouse run roughshod over you in order to keep the peace			2
in small and large ways , however , these kinds of decisions reduce your sense of self - worth , and without self - worth , you can not rid yourself of your powerlessness			1
examine why it 's " good " to be a victim			1
once you start chipping away at your self - worth , it 's a short step to becoming a victim			1
i define being a victim as engaging in " selfless pain			1
" in other words , by telling yourself that you do n't really count , you can make the suffering you endure into a kind of virtue , as all martyrs do			2
it 's " good " when you serve a higher spiritual purpose -- or so some religion suggest but what if there is no higher purpose ? most victims feel good about worrying all the time , but worry makes you far more vulnerable to bad things in general , since worry is so all - consuming that the mind is n't free and alert enough to tell real threats from imaginary ones			1
@entity131 feels like a protection -- when it is exactly the opposite			2
victims find lots of other " good " reasons for their plight			2
they are forgiving of an abusive spouse , because forgiveness is considered spiritual			2
they enable an addict , because tolerance and acceptance of others is equally spiritual			2
but if you stand back , you 'll see that victims in such situations are deliberately bringing suffering upon themselves , which not only confirms their powerlessness , it encourages it to grow and grow			2
the victim is always being acted upon			1
there are enough abusers , addicts , rage - aholics , control freaks , and petty tyrants out there to drain the power from anyone who volunteers to play the role of victim			1
having given away too much of themselves , the first step for victims is to realize that their role is voluntary			1
they are not trapped by fate , destiny , or the will of @entity172			1
their role is a personal choice , and they can chose differently			1

human beings are the only creatures who do not mature automatically			1
a baby chick has no choice but to turn into a chicken			0
but the world is full of people stuck in childhood and adolescence , no matter how old they happen to be			0
for us , to mature is a decision : adulthood is an achievement , one that requires -- and results in -- personal power			1
this can takes decades , but it starts with a vision of the " core self			0
" this is the part of you that connects to reality , placing you at the center of experiences that you personally create			0
to have a core self is to be the author of your own story ; it is the exact opposite of being a victim , who must live a life authored by others			1
@entity11 : 4 steps to a more meaningful life 4			0
align yourself with the flow of evolution , or personal growth			1
once you establish your core self as a goal , your path will unfold and you will evolve			0
this evolution is wobbly at first ; everyone has at least some elements of ignorance and immaturity			0
@entity231 ' thanks to free will , you can help guide your own evolution			0
the simple fact is that we all desire more and better things for ourselves			0
if those more and better things are good for our growth , then we are guiding our own positive and powerful evolution			0
in @entity240 they make a distinction between dharma and adharma			0
dharma includes whatever naturally upholds life : happiness , truth , duty , virtue , wonder , worship , reverence , appreciation , nonviolence , love , self - respect			1
on the other hand , adharma consists of choices that do not support life naturally : anger , violence , fear , control , dogmatism , skepticism , unvirtuous acts , prejudice , addiction , intolerance , and unconsciousness in general			0
for our purposes , dharma is the ultimate power			1
it easily supports you , a single individual			0
what is asked of you is that you honestly look at your everyday life and the choices you are making			0
ask yourself how to increase the dharmic choices and decrease the adharmic ones			0
trust in a power that transcends everyday reality			1
nothing described so far will come true without a higher reality			1
for the moment , let 's leave aside religion and any reference to @entity172			1
fortunately , to have even a speck of consciousness is to be connected to the finite consciousness that supports life , evolution , creativity , and intelligence			0
none of these things are accidental or a privilege handed out to the lucky few			0
to use a metaphor , imagine that you are caught in a net			0
all nets have holes , so find one , and jump through it			0
i 've known wives of abusive husbands who found a hole through , say , learning to paint			0
for them , it was an escape route , and as they made art , their thinking changed from " i am trapped and can do nothing " to " i must be worth more than i imagined , because look at this beautiful thing i created			1
" escape routes exist along the qualities hidden in consciousness			0
go beyond by discovery and exploration			0
you start to see glimmers of light through the fog of your situation			1
something more beautiful starts to attract you , and you want to go toward it			0
let your mind lead the way			0
you start having newer , more exciting thoughts than the old habitual ones you 've been following			1
new points of view attract you , so you move toward them			0
you 'll want to expand your mind in place of living behind defenses and boundaries			0
discover that you can forgive yourself and others			0
fantasies of hurt and revenge are replaced with emotional softening			0
you see that there is untapped love around you , so you move toward it			0
the fact that you desire to love and be loved starts to motivate you , without excuses about being unworthy			0
notice -- and learn -- when you have an epiphany , a moment of dramatic awakening			0
these are the great " aha " experiences that peel away an entire layer of reality			0
we say that the heavens open , but really it 's a new level of consciousness , one that brings more light			1
understand that life is full of awe and wonder			0
from this you see a reason to revere your own existence			0
you have been placed in a world where you can be devoted to something , and your worship gives you a sense of worth			1
@entity11 : how to embrace the present moment these escape routes all lead back to the person you really are , and that person know that what really counts extends far beyond the individual : the glory of creation , the beauty of nature , the heart qualities of love and compassion , the mental power to discover new things , and those unexpected epiphanies that bring the presence of @entity172 -- these universal aspects are your true source of power			1
