-- a @entity2 pastor in @entity3 has been sentenced to death for allegedly renouncing his @entity6 religion and another faces a possible indictment on the same charge of apostasy , according to a prominent activist group working for human rights in @entity3			1
@entity13 , a 32 - year - old member of the @entity3 ministry and pastor of an approximately 400 - person congregation in the northern city of @entity18 , faces death , according to the @entity20			1
in the southern city of @entity22 , another @entity24 pastor , @entity25 , 35 , is facing a possible indictment for apostasy			1
" this is part of a greater trend of persecution against @entity24 , " said @entity27 , brother of @entity28 and member of the @entity30 of @entity3 's @entity31			1
@entity24 are feeling the heat in other parts of the @entity6 world as well			1
in @entity38 , @entity24 have been attacked and many have fled their homes for other lands			1
in @entity43 , a @entity24 woman faces a death sentence for blasphemy for allegedly defiling the name of the @entity47			1
on september 22 , @entity3 's 11th @entity48 for the @entity49 upheld the death sentence and conviction of @entity13 for apostasy			1
apostasy is the " act of renouncing one 's religion , " the human rights group said tuesday , but it " is not a crime under @entity3 's @entity58			1
instead , the presiding judge in @entity13 's case rested his opinion on texts by @entity64 religious scholars			2
" " it is the low point of any judicial system to sentence a person to death outside of its own legal framework , " said @entity65 , a spokesman for the campaign			2
" to execute someone based on the religion they choose to practice or not practice is the ultimate form of religious discrimination and disregard for the freedom of conscience and belief			2
" the judgment said @entity13 was born to @entity6 parents but converted to @entity2 when he was age 19 and it said that " during interrogations @entity13 made a written confession admitting he left @entity89 for @entity2			1
" he said during his trial that his " interrogators pressured him into making the statement , " the campaign said			2
" i am not an apostate			0
... prior to 19 years old i did not accept any religion , " @entity13 said at trial , according to the campaign			0
@entity13 said he was coaxed by an interrogator into thinking " that a person who is born to @entity6 parents , and does not accept a religion other than @entity89 before reaching the religious maturity age ( 15 for males ) , is automatically a @entity6			1
" @entity13 's attorney on sunday filed an objection to the sentence with @entity3 's @entity107			1
two articles in the constitution grant @entity24 " the right to freely worship and form religious societies " and another " obligates the @entity64 government to uphold the equality and human rights of @entity24			1
" the judge based his decision on constitutional provisions and @entity119 " civil procedures that instruct judges to consult sources when there is no codified - law that addresses a matter , " according to the campaign			0
there is also a part of the penal code allowing " judges to draw upon their personal knowledge when adjudicating cases			0
" " more and more , the @entity64 judiciary is departing from any recognized form of due process , issuing arbitrary judgments based on vague , open - ended laws , " said @entity65			0
" laws and evidence are increasingly irrelevant and unrelated to judicial outcomes in @entity3			1
" @entity140 , chairman of the @entity141 , said the " draconian language in the verdict makes it very clear that the @entity64 authorities mean business			0
he could be executed at any time			0
and for what ? for being a @entity24			2
" " we call upon the @entity150 administration and the international community to use every means available , to raise this issue and demand the unconditional release of mr. @entity13			0
" @entity141 officials said the last known execution of a @entity24 in @entity3 for apostasy was 20 years ago this month			1
the rev. @entity157 -- a @entity6 who converted to @entity2 in 1964 and served pastor and evangelist in the @entity30 -- was arrested and charged with apostasy and insulting @entity89 as a result of his own conversion and efforts to convert @entity89			1
he was hanged in december 1990			0
also , there have been executions of people of the @entity169 faith in @entity3 , including one charged with apostasy in 1998 , the officials said			1
in the @entity22 case , @entity27 told the campaign his brother was arrested in june			0
" eight members of his congregation including his wife were arrested two days later but were eventually released , " he is quoted as saying			0
" for several months he was in solitary confinement			0
we had no word from him and he had no contact with his lawyer			0
he has been moved to ( prison ) but we worry about the type of pressure he was under while in solitary confinement			0
" after his release from solitary confinement , @entity25 and his lawyer , @entity186 , attended a hearing in which " prosecutors sought to indict him for apostasy along with the crimes of acting against national security , propaganda against the regime , and insulting sanctities			2
" " we are most concerned with the apostasy charge , " @entity186 said			2
" that 's where most of my energy has gone , to save him from death			2
" the clergyman 's brother said @entity25 was born to @entity24 parents and was never a @entity6 , saying his mother is a @entity24 immigrant from the @entity207 and his father converted before he was born			1
" technically speaking , the court should dismiss this charge , " said @entity186 , " but the judge has to review the accusations first			0
" @entity186 told the campaign that his office asked some top clerics to issue opinions on apostasy under @entity89			2
four @entity218 's , including the late grand ayatollah @entity219 , said that converting from @entity89 to one of the @entity222 religions , including @entity2 , is not construed as apostasy and the convert " should be treated the same way as people of other religions would be , " @entity186 said			2
@entity226 was under temporary detention june 6 after he reported on a summons to the revolutionary court in @entity22			0
at the time , he was free on bail stemming from a december 2009 arrest			0
but @entity25 's temporary detention order expired on october 18 , @entity186 said			0
" technically he is being held illegally , " according to the campaign .			0
