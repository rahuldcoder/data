@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 aimed saturday to shift attention from @entity6 's straw poll to @entity1 and @entity7 , where he told conservative activists he is seeking the 2012 @entity10 presidential nomination			1
the @entity12 governor addressed a group of voters in @entity0 , @entity1 , a state where he is expected to launch an aggressive campaign			1
" it 's time to get @entity19 working , folks , and that 's the reason i am announcing my candidacy today to be president of the @entity19 , " he said , as supporters cheered			0
@entity3 came in sixth as an unofficial write - in on the nonbinding @entity26			2
@entity28 rep. @entity27 , @entity12 rep. @entity29 and former @entity28 gov. @entity30 , as expected , took the top three positions in the vote			0
@entity3 spoke at the home of deputy house speaker @entity34 , one of several state officials who had previously traveled to @entity36 , @entity12 , to woo the governor			1
@entity3 told his supporters that he intends to " compete for every vote in every state " and vowed to cover the country during the course of his campaign			2
he addressed @entity44 directly during his speech , telling the president : " you ca n't win the future by selling it off to foreign creditors			2
" he called the recent @entity52 's downgrade of the @entity19 credit rating one of a " number of recent downgrades			0
" earlier in the day , @entity3 announced that he would run for the @entity10 nomination at the @entity57 in @entity58 , @entity7 , one day after meeting with @entity59 republicans			1
" i came to @entity7 because i can not accept the path the country is on , " @entity3 said			1
" a renewed nation needs a new president			0
" @entity3 recited a litany of issues facing @entity19 , including debt , high unemployment and hefty energy costs			0
leadership under @entity44 , he said , is " rudderless			0
" " it 's time to believe the promise of our future is better than the best days behind us , " @entity3 said to applause			2
he launched his presidential campaign website , rickperry.org , shortly before the announcement			0
the timing of the announcement buttressed @entity3 's bid to get attention on a busy day in @entity19 politics : his @entity7 speech started the same hour as those given by candidates making a pitch for straw poll votes in @entity6			1
@entity87 , a political science professor at @entity88 in @entity89 , said @entity3 's appeal to both social and fiscal conservatives could be crucial in the @entity7 @entity10 primary , which every @entity10 presidential nominee has won since 1980			1
" he would appeal to tea party republicans , he would appeal to the individuals who are interested in job creation in the state , " @entity87 told @entity2			0
" he can also , i think , appeal to evangelical @entity98 , and the overlap between evangelical tea party @entity10 , economic development @entity10 -- those are a lot of voters in a @entity7 @entity10 primary			2
" @entity7 gov. @entity106 helped kick off the @entity57 conference , saying @entity10 will unite to defeat @entity44			1
@entity3 told the @entity7 crowd that he has helped cut taxes and government spending in @entity12			1
meanwhile , @entity44 campaign spokesman @entity111 struck back , saying @entity3 " pledged to support the ' cut , cap and balance ' plan that would preserve subsidies for oil and gas companies and tax cuts for the wealthiest while ending @entity120 as we know it , eroding @entity122 , eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and erasing investments in education and research and development			1
" in a statement , @entity111 claimed the governor " allowed special interests to write their own rules , hired corporate lobbyists to oversee corporations , and cut funding for programs that would create opportunity for middle - class families			0
" @entity3 succeeded @entity138 in the @entity12 governor 's office and has held that job longer than anyone in state history			1
his entry into the race will shake up the @entity10 field , putting @entity3 into direct competition with @entity27 for core right - wing support			0
former @entity151 gov. @entity150 , if she runs , also would vie for that backing			0
a @entity2 / @entity154 poll released thursday showed 15 % of @entity10 and independent voters who lean toward the @entity10 picked @entity3 as their choice for the @entity10 nomination			2
that put @entity3 , still a noncandidate at the time , just 2 percentage points behind former @entity160 gov. @entity159 , considered the front - runner in the nominating process			0
@entity159 's advantage over @entity3 is within the survey 's sampling error			2
working the crowd in @entity6 , @entity159 said friday that he expects a " more interesting contest " with @entity3 in the field			1
@entity2 's @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0
