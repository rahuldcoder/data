( @entity4 ) -- in spring 2007 , @entity12 and @entity14 professor @entity13 challenged students in his @entity17 class to come up with an affordable and efficient solar water heater that could be used in low - income households			1
the heaters installed in @entity22 have made an important impact on peoples ' lives , student says			1
now , a little more than a year later , one team of students has already installed solar water heaters on the roofs of several homes in @entity31 , @entity22			1
they have been so beneficial to the recipients that there are already plans to mass produce the heaters locally			2
the team of @entity39 graduate students and alumni said they are planning to enter their heater design into a national competition in october			1
though the heater has only been tested in middle - and lower - class residential homes in @entity31 , the team hopes to extend the technology to other developing countries in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , said @entity51 , a mechanical engineering doctoral student currently in @entity22			1
" the more we advance with the project , the more we realize it has an important impact on the life of people and it has a great potential to be replicated in other places around the world , " said team member @entity53 , who is working toward a masters in business administration			2
@entity51 said the team hopes the heaters will stimulate local economies			1
" this is a crucial step to not only integrate technologies into the third world for beneficial resources , but to make these resources available sustainably , " said @entity51			2
the team spent the spring 2007 semester working to perfect the design of a solar water heater @entity13 had presented to their class			1
over spring break , team member @entity77 , an engineering doctoral student , traveled to @entity31 to assess the community and see what local materials were available to build the heaters			1
" @entity77 found that ... households use electric in - line heaters for showering , which are costly due to the electricity expenses and hazardous since you are prone to getting shocked , " said engineering doctoral student @entity83			0
by the end of the spring 2007 semester , the team had built and tested a prototype that heated water up to 40 degrees @entity93 - sufficient for showering , members said			0
during spring break this year , members of the team traveled to @entity22 to test a third prototype of the heater and conduct market analysis surveys			1
in the coming months , @entity53 said he plans to survey the families that tested the heater to find out the impact it has had on their daily lives			0
though the team said it currently has two heaters that have been successfully installed , there are several adjustments to make based on user feedback before they can present their finished product to manufacturing companies			2
" it is one thing to develop a technology in a university lab , but another to develop it in the field with all of the uncertainties and unknown challenges that are n't always technically and socially apparent , " @entity51 said			0
despite temporary challenges , the team remains confident that the affordability of the heater will dramatically alter the lives of low - income families			0
the group estimates the heaters will cost $ 100 each when mass produced			0
" ( @entity31 ) is an urban community with significant economic activity that has little access to new technologies ... there is a lot of potential to create a local industry that will create jobs , bring better products to the market and improve quality of life of the population , " said @entity53 .			2
