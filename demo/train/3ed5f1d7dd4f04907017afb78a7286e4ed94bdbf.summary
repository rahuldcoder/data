-- @entity2 coach @entity1 has rejected suggestions that @entity4 has been " victimized " in his pay dispute with the @entity7 football club			1
the @entity9 midfielder , who earns a reported $ 290,000 a week , has been asked to extend his contract by an extra year to 2016 for the same total salary as cash - trapped @entity2 seek to cut costs			1
last weekend the club said the 28 - year - old would not be selected until he agreed to the new conditions , a move which has angered the international players ' union @entity17			1
" clubs say that players must respect contracts , but why should that not apply in reverse ? " @entity17 secretary general @entity24 said last week			2
" it is not as if @entity4 has taken a gun to the head of the board of @entity2 to force them to submit that contract			1
the club offered it to him with their full understanding			2
" @entity36 's @entity35 set new record however , @entity1 insists that he has not picked @entity4 -- who was one of @entity2 's key players in the 2009 - 10 treble - winning season under @entity40 -- because of footballing reasons			1
" it 's my job to pick the best team available , and at the moment i 'm not picking him , " @entity1 said after sunday 's 1 - 0 win at home to @entity44 , which kept @entity2 in third place -- four points behind leaders @entity48			1
" this has nothing to do with his contract , i have to select the team and @entity2 come first			1
it 's not a case of the president telling me not to pick @entity4 , i pick the team			1
and i think it 's outrageous to suggest @entity4 is being ' victimized			1
' " we should be careful when using terms such as ' victimized			0
' if someone who earns 1,000 euros a month heard us , we 'd look a bit silly			0
it 's my job to decide who 's in the best shape to play and i do so			0
i make my decisions and i stand by them			0
" @entity17 says it will demand action from football 's ruling bodies against clubs which seek to " blackmail " players into accepting reduced terms			2
" this type of practice used to be an exception			0
unfortunately , we now see clubs in all countries in @entity85 using this type of measure			0
for us , the time has come to sound the bell , " @entity88 said			0
he cited another prominent example in @entity93 striker @entity92 , who has been dropped by @entity94 after refusing to assign a new deal			1
" if you want to offer a player a lower contract , you must only do that at the end of his current contract , " @entity88 said			0
the @entity2 won on sunday thanks to a 74th - minute own goal by defender @entity104 , whose struggling @entity44 team is coached by @entity106 -- sacked by @entity2 last season after only five games in charge			1
@entity110 stayed second with a 5 - 1 thrashing of bottom club @entity112 , as @entity114 striker @entity113 and @entity116 midfielder @entity115 scored twice each			2
@entity113 has now fired 10 league goals this season , putting him second behind @entity120 's @entity119			0
@entity121 retained fourth place despite being held 2 - 2 by @entity123 , who canceled out two goals by @entity127 defender @entity126 before having @entity128 sent off at the end			0
@entity130 joined @entity121 on 29 points with a 2 - 1 win at home to @entity134 , with veteran @entity136 striker @entity135 netting the second goal for his ninth this season			2
in @entity93 , fourth - placed @entity141 kept pace with the leading clubs after winning 3 - 2 at @entity144 , as striker @entity145 netted the opening two goals			1
second - bottom @entity144 leveled with two goals from striker @entity150 , but @entity141 snatched victory through on - loan @entity153 winger @entity152			0
@entity155 stayed seventh after being held 1 - 1 by @entity157			0
