-- october 7 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : hope you know your branches of government , ' cause they 're all showing up in today 's show			1
it 's thursday ; i 'm @entity22 ; this is @entity0 , bringing today 's headlines right to your classroom			1
first up : war in @entity4 @entity27 : first up , leaders in @entity4 and @entity5 are trying to stop something that started nine years ago today : the war in @entity4			1
these leaders are getting together for meetings this week to work on ways to end the fighting			2
one group that 'll have to be involved in any kind of peace deal : the @entity33			1
that is the militant group that used to control @entity4 when the war started back in 2001			1
they 're not in power anymore ; they were kicked out by the @entity42 - led coalition			1
but they are the ones who are fighting against @entity42 , @entity4 and coalition forces			1
@entity46 explains some of the challenges in getting the sides to agree			2
@entity49 , @entity0 correspondent : you 've got to bridge a huge gap to get two warring parties to sit down at the negotiating table			2
and what you 've got right now is the @entity33 insisting it will not talk peace until what it calls " foreign occupying forces , " some 150,000 @entity42 and @entity58 troops , leave the country			1
the @entity42 , for its part , it says that a negotiated peace would require the @entity33 to cut ties with @entity65 , to follow the @entity4 constitution , and to put down weapons			1
so , there 's a lot of space between these two enemies right now			1
the @entity4 government seems to be trying to fit somewhere in between right now			1
medal of honor @entity27 : a @entity42 soldier who gave his life while fighting in @entity4 is being awarded the @entity73 ; that is the military 's highest honor			1
in 2008 , during a battle with the @entity33 , staff sergeant @entity79 , a @entity80 , purposely drew the enemy 's fire so that his team could get to safety			1
the @entity85 says sergeant @entity79 's actions helped save his fellow @entity87 and 15 @entity4 soldiers			1
president @entity89 presented the award to sergeant @entity79 's family yesterday			1
his parents said that they feel a sense of pride , knowing that their 24 - year - old son gave his life so that others could live			2
twisters in @entity6 @entity27 : what you are looking at right here is the damage left behind when tornadoes hit parts of @entity6 on wednesday			2
at least two twisters struck near @entity105			2
authorities say the storms derailed a train			2
they also damaged more than 100 houses and injured at least seven people			2
officials said none of those injuries were thought to be serious			0
the train that was derailed , it had actually stopped on the tracks because of the tornado warning			0
is this legit ? @entity119 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the legislative branch of the @entity42 government is responsible for interpreting the country 's laws			1
not legit ! interpreting the country 's laws is the responsibility of the judicial branch			1
extent of free speech @entity27 : the top part of that branch , the @entity42 @entity129 , is dealing with a case that involves the freedom of speech and the right to privacy			1
it all has to do with a small church that protested at the funeral of a @entity42 soldier who died in @entity138			1
the church says it 's protesting against soldiers who , in its view , fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality			1
church members argue that the freedom of speech gives them the right to express their beliefs by protesting at certain events , including funerals			1
the father of the soldier whose funeral was protested says his son was not gay			0
he argues that the protest was an invasion of privacy			1
the @entity129 is n't expected to rule on the case for several months			1
@entity158 @entity27 : swinging back over to the legislative branch of government			0
it 's responsible for making laws , as you know , you 've learned in government class			1
@entity165 is working on a law right now that could bring some @entity158 to tv			0
all right , you know how when you 're watching a show and a commercial comes on			0
well , not when you 're watching @entity0			0
but , okay , the commercial comes on , and it 's way louder than the show ? that could stop			1
last week , the @entity173 unanimously passed the @entity158 , or @entity158			0
basically , it says a commercial ca n't be louder than the show			0
if the @entity178 approves the bill later this year and president @entity89 signs it , it 'll be the new law			0
@entity181 @entity182 , @entity183 , " @entity182 " : when you get into the internet , the problem with that is the bully does n't have to look the victim in the eye			1
you know , they do n't have to deal with them one on one			1
they do n't see the repercussions of what they 're doing			0
i call them keyboard bullies , you know			0
they can just do this stuff with great anonymity			0
85 % of the time , research tells us , there 's no consequence to what they do whatsoever			1
@entity212 @entity27 : we 've been talking about different kinds of bullying all week long			1
today , we want to talk about solutions , ways to try and stop bullying			1
@entity218 visited a school in @entity220 where students are promising to stand up against bullies			1
she talked to two students -- one who 's been bullied , one who bullied other people -- about why they think this is such an important issue			1
( begin video ) @entity227 : i am somebody			0
i can make a difference			0
@entity218 , @entity0 correspondent : at @entity232 's @entity231 , students are pledging to protect the bullied			1
it 's especially important to @entity234			1
she knows how bullying feels			1
is it worse with words , do you think ? @entity240 , @entity241 : i think it is , because when i was little , like , people always said i was , like , really ugly			0
and it , i never knew it affected me so much			0
and , like , people would ask if i was a boy or a girl , and i was hurt			0
i never wanted that to happen and , like , it lowered my self esteem really bad			0
and i never wanted to go to school			0
@entity251 : so , i see it hurts you			0
i see it hurts you so much			0
but you know you 're beautiful , right ? yes			0
it 's the kind of pain that affects so many children			2
one in three kids are bullied or bully every year			0
@entity260 : kids being bullied do n't always tell you about it			0
@entity251 : @entity264 , who is also participating in @entity266 ' anti-bullying campaign , knows exactly what @entity267 is talking about			0
in junior high school , she was a bully			0
why ? @entity271 , @entity241 : i do n't really know if there was a reason			0
it was just an easy target , i guess			0
@entity251 : is it because other kids were making fun of those kids too ? @entity279 : yes , there was a lot of others also bullying			2
@entity251 : so , sort of like a mob mentality			0
@entity251 : when you were calling people names , did it make you feel better ? @entity279 : it 's not that it made me feel better			2
it 's that i knew they felt worse			2
@entity251 : @entity234 , @entity264 certainly know the consequences			0
they 're hoping to make this school year bully free			2
( @entity291 ) blog report @entity27 : all right , there are a few places where you 're keeping this conversation going			0
from our blog , it does n't look like many of you think bullying 's gon na go away			1
listen to @entity303 : he thinks bullying is a part of life , and says " we all just have to live with it			2
" and @entity313 : " it takes a strong person to stop bullying when they see it			2
we need more strong people			0
" something new we 're doing this year : the @entity315			0
this is also on our front page , right under our blog			0
here 's what some of your teachers are saying about bullying			1
@entity323 says his middle school has tried several anti-bullying programs , " but each year , students still list bullying as the number one problem			1
" he says it 's frustrating that this persists			2
@entity332 tells us " the biggest issue among students is the fear of telling adults , either for fear of personal harm or getting a reputation as a tattle tale			2
" and teacher 12345 suggests trying to catch bullying before it starts			2
" if you see mild conflict with two students , stop that before it turns into bullying			1
" @entity348 @entity349 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity352 's social studies classes at @entity353 in @entity354 , @entity355 ! what is featured on the @entity42 presidential seal ? is it : a ) the @entity178 , b ) the president 's picture , c ) a bald eagle or @entity363 ) an @entity42 flag ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a bald eagle is front and center on the presidential seal			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity373 @entity27 : all right , so this is a little different than what we normally do , because president @entity89 usually does n't show up in our before we go segment			2
you 're about to see why he is today			2
@entity42 president @entity89 : we can not sustain ... [ thud ] oops			1
was that my , uh ... ? oh , goodness			0
