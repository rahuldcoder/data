@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity4 man who has just claimed the world land sailing speed record is now planning to better his speed -- on ice			1
@entity8 , driven by @entity10 @entity9 has claimed the land sailing speed record using just wind power , @entity9 drove his vehicle , the @entity8 , to 202 km / hour ( 126 miles / hour ) in late march on the dry @entity14 near the border of @entity16 and @entity17 in the western @entity18			1
greenbird is a carbon fibre composite craft -- described by the makers on their web site as " part airplane , part sailboat and part @entity27 car " -- that uses solid sails to harness the power of the wind			1
it weighs 600 kg and is able to travel up to four or five times greater than the speed of the wind -- at which point the downward force of the wings increases the craft 's weight to nearly a ton			2
the only metal in the structure is in the wing bearings and the wheel			0
@entity9 told @entity2 the record came after the team , which is sponsored by @entity4 - based green electricity company @entity47 , made gains in all aspects of the vehicle 's design			1
" it 's a real mixture of everything -- all of the margins are so tight you have to make a little gain in every place			0
" the technologically advanced @entity8 works by using the flow of air over its vertical sail to push it forward			2
it transfers the side force of wind into downward energy to keep it from taking off -- a similar concept to that used in @entity27 race cars			2
@entity8 's record speed defeated the previous record set by @entity18 @entity71 in 1999			1
@entity71 , in what he described as a " boat " called the " @entity75 , " managed 116 miles per hour			2
view a photo gallery of the successful speed record attempt Â» @entity9 told @entity2 he had been working towards the record for about 10 years and was ecstatic to have managed the feat. " we had been working on this for a long time			1
it started when i was at university ... so it was great to finally achieve the record			0
" the 32 - year - old said bad weather and attracting sponsorship had been the main challenges in preparing to set the record			0
" you have to be very lucky for the weather to be right at the right time			0
for years i thought we were going to be unlucky			0
" with the land sailing record under his belt , @entity9 now plans to return to work on his greenbird ice sailing craft -- which he feels has the potential to be even quicker than the greenbird land racer			1
" theoretically it should be a lot faster , but currently ice yachts are not as quick as land yachts			0
we are not completely sure why			0
" @entity9 said his next ice sailing attempt would likely take place in december this year on @entity105 in @entity106 , where the ice is large and secure enough for the vehicle			1
it is also important to make attempts before snow falls on the ice , creating more drag , @entity9 added			2
ice sailing is significantly more risky than land sailing , he told @entity2			1
" depending on when you go , the ice can be a lot more unstable			0
there is the risk that you could go through a water - hole into the ice			0
we try not to think about it , " @entity9 said			0

@entity8 , driven by @entity9 , claims the land sailing speed record
the land yacht reaches 202 km / hour ( 126.1 miles / hour ) on a dry lake in @entity16
makers describe craft as " part airplane , part sailboat and part @entity27 car "
@entity9 is now aiming to better the speed in @entity106 in his ice - sailing craft
