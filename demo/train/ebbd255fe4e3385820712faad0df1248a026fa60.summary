-- the @entity1 is on the verge of losing a fierce advocate for democracy in @entity5			1
@entity6 , ambassador to @entity7 , was initially nominated by president @entity8 in late 2009			1
he made her a recess appointment in august 2010			0
she has hit the ground running in a @entity12 country that , thanks to her tireless work , has become a close partner and ally of the @entity1			2
it was the first @entity5 country to send troops to @entity20			0
@entity6 has been renominated , but if the @entity21 does not confirm her nomination next week , she will head home , leaving her impressive work unfinished and a gaping hole in our country 's efforts to continue to build and sustain strong and transparent democracies south of the border			1
why would n't the @entity21 confirm her ? sadly , as with everything in @entity33 right now , it would be purely because of partisan politics			0
it would be because @entity36 would rather shoot themselves ( and the country ) in the foot before they give president @entity8 a perceived political " win			2
" @entity40 sen. @entity40 is using an even worse excuse to vote against her : a commentary she wrote recently for a daily newspaper in @entity7 urging tolerance and inclusion for gays and lesbians			0
the op - ed was the result of a @entity53 directive to all @entity1 ambassadors urging them to recognize @entity55			0
last time i checked , tolerance and inclusion were all - american values that we should all hold dear			0
@entity36 need to put these distractions , which have nothing to do with @entity6 's clear abilities , aside and recognize that her approval would be a win for the country			1
there is still time for @entity36 to reconsider how important her work in @entity7 has been and how foolish and petty it would be for them to put politics before good policy			1
this is especially true in a region where we are fighting every day to turn back the influence of totalitarian regimes such as @entity77 , and other regimes like @entity79 , that while technically democratic , engage in suppression and human rights violations			0
@entity6 has been a true soldier for representative government , human rights and the rule of law			0
it is not too late for republicans to look at her record objectively and realize her many accomplishments not only deserve recognition , they deserve to be seen through to fruition as she fulfills her entire term			0
republicans should let her finish her work with the first @entity94 , which she has overseen through a partnership with @entity96			2
they should let her finish what she started by negotiating with the @entity7 government for the creation of the new @entity100 , which marks a significant milestone in the fight against organized crime in @entity7			2
republicans should let her finish her efforts with the @entity106 , an economic development initiative focused on understanding the barriers to growth in our partner countries with tremendous potential			0
@entity6 took leadership of the @entity106 and immediately established a joint action plan that could ensure the kind of on - the - ground transformational change that @entity7 needs to give its citizens hope for a better life -- if she can stay to finish the job			1
in fact , her work on economic development will go a long way toward stemming the flow of illegal immigration to the @entity1			2
if @entity7 believe they will have good economic opportunities to provide for their families in their beloved home country , they will not choose to come to the @entity1 , relieving some of the incoming flow of undocumented immigrants			1
republicans could also easily send a message to our neighbors to the south , that they support their countries and want to be true partners with them			0
in @entity7 , where @entity6 has helped unite the country 's factions , that message could be sent by approving her ambassadorship			1
republicans would also be sending a positive message , at a time when they so desperately need it , to the @entity149 community in the @entity1 , and to women in general , if they approve @entity6 , who has a long and rich history of work in the nonprofit sector and the private sector , as well as extensive experience in government			1
she is highly regarded by @entity157 of all backgrounds here in the @entity1			0
@entity6 's advocacy for democratic values will be by far her most lasting legacy in @entity7			1
she has become a leader of that country 's women 's empowerment movement , has been a tireless advocate for increased government transparency and accountability , and -- republicans should be thrilled with this one -- she has been a staunch supporter of the @entity1 private sector , constantly looking at ways to support @entity5 jobs by opening up markets and opportunities for companies in @entity7			1
@entity6 has also been an unmoving @entity1 presence against any @entity77 - @entity79 influence , including sending a direct message to @entity7 's president , @entity179 , about the need to address human rights and democracy with @entity183 during @entity179 ' first official visit to @entity77			1
next week , the @entity21 should show @entity1 that on something as simple but important as a nomination to be ambassador to @entity7 , they can get it right			1
let 's send ambassador @entity6 back to finish the job			2
we will all be better off for it			0
