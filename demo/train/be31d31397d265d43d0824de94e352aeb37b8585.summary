@entity0 -- everywhere 10 - year - old @entity3 went , from @entity4 to the @entity5 in @entity6 , she brought along a frying pan , and used it to smash a walnut			1
it was a tradition that started about a year ago , when @entity3 's father broke the news to his young daughter that she had a terminal brain tumor			1
" they told us it was about the size of a walnut in her head , " recalls @entity15			0
" we went from store to store to store to find a whole bag of walnuts , found them , took them out to the deck outside , and got a frying pan out , and said we 're going to visualize ... smashing the walnuts			0
smashing the tumor inside your head , " @entity3 's father said			1
" i 'm @entity3 , i 'm 10 years old , and i have brain cancer , " she would say after smashing the walnuts			1
it 's one example of how a little girl 's devastating news transformed her into a warrior -- against her own cancer and on behalf of other children			1
" we told her that we live in an amazing country , and we have access to great medical care , and great doctors , and they 'll help us			0
but you also have to be part of your recovery			0
and she embraced that , " @entity3 's mother , @entity50 , recalled			1
searching for clinical trials as @entity3 suffered from toxic treatments , the @entity51 quickly learned how little was available for kids with cancer			1
" @entity3 questioned , all the time , ' why they do n't have a real drug that will help us kids ? why are they using us as guinea pigs ? ' " @entity50 said			1
less than 4 % of $ 5 billion in cancer research goes to childhood cancers			1
budget deal aims to avert another shutdown " there 's no money in it for the drug companies , which i understand			0
there 's only a couple hundred kids a year in @entity75 that get diagnosed with what @entity3 had			1
so all of the millions of dollars it would take to find a drug to fix it , they would n't make their money			0
and i get that , " @entity15 said			0
" but that 's where we also hope the federal government can step in			0
" @entity3 embraced activism -- gathering 250,000 letters for @entity90 campaign last @entity91 , and later giving speeches and making online videos that have gone viral			1
" it 's not fair that us kids get so little from the world , just because we 're smaller , just because we do n't know as much , " @entity3 said in one of those videos			1
she spoke eloquently , like someone well beyond her 10 years , about the gravity of her situation and that of other children with cancer			1
" sometimes at night , i 'll be with my mom and dad and i will be absolutely crying and i 'll be saying , ' i do n't want to leave you			0
i want you to go first , ' " she said in a video			0
" once you get cancer , you kind of have to be all grown - up , " @entity3 said , in tears , " you do n't really have a childhood			1
" but she combined very adult concepts with little - girl ideas			2
she made a list of things she wanted her parents to do after she passed away , including going to the haunted mansion at @entity120 , and always saving her a piece of birthday cake			0
and her message for politicians was simple enough for anyone to understand			0
" stop talking and start doing , " she said			0
two weeks after @entity3 made that blunt statement , her condition worsened , and she was placed in hospice care			1
six weeks ago , on october 27 , she lost her 11 - month battle with cancer			1
but her message got through to some in @entity133			1
@entity134 emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal rep. @entity137 , @entity138 , and rep. @entity139 , @entity140 , crafted a bipartisan bill to take $ 126 million in federal money over 10 years , set aside for political conventions , to direct it to pediatric research			1
after meeting @entity3 's parents , @entity146 majority leader @entity145 , @entity147 , named the @entity149 after @entity3 and brought it to a vote on wednesday			1
the measure passed , 295 - 103			2
this " could be a really inspiring story for so many people , " @entity145 said in an interview			0
" instead of spending money on political conventions for the political parties , should n't we have as our priority medical research for kids ? " still , it 's not without controversy			2
@entity165 leaders pressed their members to vote against the legislation , and a majority of @entity146 @entity165 opposed it			2
leaders of the @entity165 - controlled @entity171 currently have no plans to bring the bill to a vote			2
" this bill of @entity181 is an absolute fraud , " said rep. @entity175 , @entity177 - @entity176 , ranking @entity178 on the @entity179			2
@entity175 says the bill would not do what @entity145 says it would			0
she says not only is $ 13 million a year a drop in the bucket when it comes to cancer research , she also notes it would not appropriate money , so it 's not even guaranteed			1
she and others senior democrats oppose it as a publicity stunt , to paper over billions in cuts to federal cancer research			1
" as a mother and a grandmother , my heart goes out to @entity3 's mother			2
to lose a child is the most pain any person could suffer			0
so what @entity181 should do is have the @entity207 bring back the $ 1.55 billion that they cut from the @entity210 , and the almost $ 300 million cut as a result from the @entity212 , so we can really focus on saving lives for the future , " @entity175 told @entity1			0
after the @entity146 vote , @entity15 said , " we took into consideration that it may be a publicity stunt to use @entity3 's name			2
" " but they 're talking about it , " he told @entity1			0
" they 're talking about the lack of funding for pediatric disease research , pediatric cancer research ( and ) brain cancer research like @entity3 had			1
" " so as long as they 're talking about it , we felt comfortable letting them use @entity3 to help build support and momentum for it			2
" as for the bill 's long political odds , @entity50 said she and her husband " thought that if it did n't pass ( the @entity146 ) , that 's fine			0
it 's the first step and it 's raising a lot of awareness			0
" but " @entity3 's hand " was " in there " for the @entity146 vote , she said			2
and now @entity3 's " thinking , ' @entity171			2
it 's your turn now ! ' " first on @entity1 : republicans moving to overhaul 2016 primary process @entity139 , the @entity165 sponsor , says he too wants billions reinvested for cancer research , but says you 've got to start somewhere			1
" we 've got to learn to work together			0
@entity3 found a way to work for other people , even though she was a little girl who knew she was going to die			1
but every day , every moment of her life -- her young , small , short life -- was spent trying to help other people , so why do n't we ? " @entity139 asked			0
" can we just put the battle axes down for a while and take a step forward ? i think we can , " said @entity139			0
@entity3 said these words just a few weeks before she died : " if i lose my battle , then i want other people to carry on the war , and we 're going to win this war			2
i 'll be in a good place , and it wo n't be all that bad			0

10 - year old @entity3 was diagnosed with brain cancer
she became an activist for children with cancer
she urged members of @entity133 to work together to *bolster* child cancer research
her plea has become politically *acrimonious* on @entity278
