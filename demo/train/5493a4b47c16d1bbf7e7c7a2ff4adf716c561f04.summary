@entity0 , an economics professor and former seminary student , pulled off the biggest political upset of the year by ousting the no. 2 house republican @entity3 in a primary challenge on tuesday night			1
" this is the happiest moment , obviously , of my life , " brat told his supporters at a post-election event in @entity8 , outside @entity9 , on tuesday night			0
" the reason we won this campaign , there is just one reason , and that 's because dollars do not vote -- you do			0
" brat , who raised less than $ 300,000 to the @entity21 majority leader 's campaign war chest of $ 5.4 million , said , " it 's not about @entity18 winning tonight , it 's about returning the country to its principles			1
" just how surprising were the results ? a close ally of @entity0 's told @entity28 shortly before the results were in that he was " shocked " and that senior campaign officials did n't believe he could pull in more than 40 % of the vote			2
brat ended up besting @entity3 56 % -44 %			2
@entity3 's team included some veteran @entity35 political hands while some of @entity0 's top campaign staffers had n't worked on a major campaign before			1
many political pundits were quick to credit the tea party for boosting @entity0 's campaign , but his campaign did not get any significant financial support from conservative groups because they were funneling money into other primary challengers they believed had a better shot at beating @entity49 incumbents			1
opinion : who said the tea party was dead ? ' a shock on your hands ' in an interview a day before the vote , @entity0 made a prediction most political candidates make to try to energize their supporters , telling @entity28 , " on tuesday you 're going to have a shock on your hands			0
" brat joked that he expected to see a @entity28 van in his driveway to cover his victory on wednesday			0
brat 's main argument in the race was that @entity3 lost touch with his conservative principles			1
he told @entity28 , " my beef with @entity3 is n't not a right - or left wing thing			0
" citing his expertise on economics , @entity0 said the @entity49 leader and other top congressional @entity49 in @entity77 had set aside their " free market principles " when they backed the bailout legislation that helped bolster @entity80 banks after the fiscal crisis in 2008			2
but the longshot candidate centered most of his attacks against @entity3 on the issue of immigration , arguing that the majority leader 's support for small measures allowing some type of legal status for children of undocumented immigrants was " amnesty			2
" much of the media coverage about the race focused on @entity0 's attacks that @entity3 was n't pushing the conservative position			1
@entity3 worked to reassure @entity49 that he would not allow any legislation to come up for a vote that provided " amnesty			0
" he sent out mailers to @entity49 in the district with the message " conservative @entity49 @entity3 is stopping the @entity106 plan to give illegal aliens amnesty			2
" but @entity0 told @entity28 the issue of " amnesty " resonated more than other issues like @entity111 and jobs " because it shows @entity3 flip - flopping and being unprincipled			1
" @entity114 is the @entity115 who no longer has to face @entity3 ad spending in addition to the top @entity49 leaders ' position on immigration , @entity0 repeatedly touted his experience as an economist , and criticized both political parties for ignoring proposals to address @entity125 and @entity126			1
" neither side of the aisle will talk about the most important issues because that is going to involve pain			0
" while he is a political neophyte , @entity0 has served on state and local government boards and was a president of the @entity136 of @entity137			0
despite being the overwhelming favorite , there were signs that @entity3 's campaign sensed a threat			1
it spent more than $ 1 million on television and radio ads that attempted to paint @entity0 as a liberal			1
they noted that he was appointed to one of those boards by then - democratic virginia gov. @entity151			0
but @entity0 argued that @entity3 's aggressive ad spending did him the favor of boosting his name identification around the district at a time when he did n't have the resources to run his own ads. brat , 49 , grew up in the @entity160 and moved to @entity161 in 1996 to begin teaching economics and ethics at @entity164 , a small liberal arts institution			1
he has chaired the school 's @entity166 and @entity167 department for the past six years			0
he and his wife @entity169 have two children			0
@entity171 defeats conservative challengers , avoids runoff @entity3 loses primary in big upset @entity3 ' earthquake ' rattles @entity176			0

*upstart* @entity0 beat *heavily* favored incumbent @entity3
brat raised less than $ 300,000 *compared* to @entity3 's $ 5 million
@entity183 's main argument was that @entity3 had turned his back on conservative principles
