@entity0 -- when @entity3 praises president @entity4 as " outstanding " and " incredibly supportive , " you know something extraordinary has occurred			1
@entity4 updated on @entity6 ; praised by @entity3 in this case , it was once - in - a - lifetime @entity6 , which caused the outspoken @entity11 governor of @entity12 to declare a state of emergency and seek federal help for widespread devastation			1
interviewed tuesday on @entity16 , @entity3 described @entity4 's response as " outstanding , " and he told @entity1 that the president had been " incredibly supportive and helpful to our state			1
" " this is much more important than any election , " @entity3 told @entity1 's " @entity23			2
" @entity4 has " been outstanding to deal with on this and i look forward to seeing him tomorrow so he can see for himself what this hurricane has done to my state , " @entity3 said tuesday night			1
such effusive praise from a frequent @entity4 critic and strong supporter of @entity11 presidential challenger @entity32 put the campaign magnifying glass on a key election issue -- the role of the federal government -- a week before the november 6 vote			1
photos : aftermath of @entity6 it also focused attention on how @entity32 would handle such a disaster if he were to defeat @entity4 in what is expected to be a very close election			1
on tuesday , the @entity11 candidate showed little inclination to address the matter			0
at a campaign event changed to a storm relief effort in @entity51 , @entity32 ignored shouted questions by reporters on whether he supported the @entity55 's role in disaster relief			1
instead , he focused his remarks to supporters who donated relief supplies for storm victims on how such efforts contribute to meeting the overall need			0
" we wo n't be able to solve all the problems with our effort this morning , " @entity32 said , adding " one of the things you learn in life is you make the difference you can , and you ca n't always solve all the problems yourself			0
" @entity32 on storm aftermath : ' people are hurting ' @entity74 critics of @entity32 and his running mate -- conservative @entity77 chairman @entity76 of @entity78 -- argue their proposals to cut government spending and provide broad tax cuts without generating more government revenue will end up harming the economy and increasing the federal deficit			2
photos : @entity86 recovers from @entity6 in particular , the @entity4 campaign challenges @entity32 's contention that increased economic growth from the tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states , the private sector and humanitarian agencies and charities can balance the budget			1
last year , @entity32 argued at a @entity11 presidential debate in @entity98 that cutting federal spending should be based on prioritizing what is absolutely necessary and shedding the rest			2
asked by moderator @entity102 of @entity1 if disaster relief efforts should be turned over to states , @entity32 said that " every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states , that 's the right direction			1
and if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector , that 's even better			0
" " instead of thinking in the federal budget , what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question			0
what should we keep ? " @entity32 added			0
" we should take all of what we 're doing at the federal level and say , what are the things we 're doing that we do n't have to do ? and those things we 've got to stop doing , because we 're borrowing $ 1.6 trillion more this year than we 're taking in			0
" @entity102 cut in to ask if @entity32 was referring specifically to disaster relief , a topic in the news at the time following a deadly @entity130 , @entity131 , tornado , and @entity32 continued : " we can not afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids			1
it is simply immoral , in my view , for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids , knowing full well that we 'll all be dead and gone before it 's paid off			0
it makes no sense at all			0
" @entity32 : states should handle emergency management with then - @entity6 bearing down on the @entity144 on monday , @entity32 's debate comments from 16 months earlier became a topic of political discussion , and the @entity32 campaign issued a statement in response			1
@entity6 reminds us of climate change and other forgotten campaign issues " gov. @entity32 believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions , " said the statement by spokeswoman @entity153			1
" as the first responders , states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities , and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most			0
this includes help from the federal government and @entity55			0
" @entity153 added another sentence to the statement tuesday , saying that " a @entity32 - @entity76 administration will always ensure that disaster funding is there for those in need			2
" opinion : @entity6 shows why we need @entity55 @entity181 , administrator of the emergency management agency , told reporters tuesday that the agency had $ 3.6 billion remaining in its disaster relief fund			1
the agency works with state and local authorities as well as the @entity189 and other agencies to help disaster victims rent temporary housing , repair their homes , get loans to cover small business and farm losses , as well as assisting in cleaning up storm debris including hazardous materials			2
vice president @entity199 , meanwhile , said tuesday that the federal response to @entity6 was " working like it 's supposed to , " and he highlighted to reporters in @entity51 what he described as unprecedented cooperation between city , state and federal authorities and agencies			1
a @entity209 statement also emphasized such cooperation , noting @entity4 spoke by phone with a host of @entity11 and @entity74 governors and mayors from states affected by the storm			0
@entity6 's impact : state by state @entity32 has made political dysfunction in @entity0 a target of his campaign , blaming @entity4 for what he calls failed leadership in being unable to forge a deficit reduction deal with @entity11			1
@entity74 blame republicans for what they contend has been an unwillingness to compromise , and the focus on cooperation tuesday by @entity4 and @entity199 appeared to be aimed in part at demonstrating the administration 's ability to get things done			2
the question of the size and scope of the federal government is at the heart of both campaigns			0
@entity4 and @entity74 argue that entitlement programs such as @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 are vital to the social contract to provide contributing citizens with basic needs , and that government also has a role to play in education and technological development while providing services such as national defense and disaster relief			1
opinion : @entity6 debunks ' nanny state ' republicans , driven by the party 's conservative wing , call for immediate steps to erase the chronic budget deficits and mounting federal debt that they say imperil national security and stability			2
they want to shrink the size of government and reduce taxes while reforming entitlements by partial privatization , reducing and delaying some benefits and other steps			0
sensitive issues such as disaster relief generally play to the advantage of @entity74 and their support for government benefits , especially in a time of crisis when images of suffering victims dominate the airwaves			2
@entity6 breaks records @entity4 has avoided any direct political talk in recent days as the huge storm approached the @entity144 , canceling campaign events and focusing his attention on the administration 's response			1
in statements monday and tuesday on the storm and its aftermath , he emphasized the need for a collective response while also making sure to point out the federal role in relief efforts			2
" we 've been able to get over 1,000 @entity55 officials in place , pre-positioned , " the president said			0
" we 've been able to get supplies , food , medicine , water , emergency generators , to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding			0
" he also sounded a main campaign theme by ensuring those hit hardest by the storm that his administration and the entire nation were with them			0
" this is a tough time for millions of folks across the @entity144 , but @entity319 is tougher and we are tougher because we pull together , we do n't leave anybody behind , we make sure that we respond as a nation , " @entity4 said			0
@entity4 visits @entity189 : ' storm is not yet over ' at about the same time he spoke , the @entity209 announced that @entity4 will travel to @entity12 on wednesday " where he will join gov. @entity3 in viewing the storm damage , talking with citizens who are recovering from the storm and thanking first responders who put their lives at risk to protect their communities			2
" while the president and one of @entity32 's top supporters will be photographed together responding to disaster , @entity32 is scheduled to be in @entity334 for three campaign events			1
how to help after the superstorm @entity1 's @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 and @entity340 contributed to this report .			0
