congressional democrats revealed new documents on friday indicating the @entity2 subjected both liberal and conservative organizations to additional tax scrutiny in recent years , raising new questions about assertions of unfair politically based targeting			1
@entity9 rep. @entity8 , the top @entity10 on the @entity11 investigating the matter , asked his @entity14 counterpart to summon the @entity16 's chief investigator , @entity15 , to a panel hearing scheduled for next thursday			1
" given the new documents obtained by the committee ... i believe it is necessary to call ( @entity15 ) back before the committee to explain why he failed to disclose this critical information , " @entity8 wrote in a letter to @entity22 rep. @entity21 , the chairman of the @entity23			1
@entity8 blasted the behavior of @entity15 and @entity21 , arguing that the @entity2 probe " has been characterized by one - sided and partial information leading to unsubstantiated accusations with no basis in fact			1
" @entity21 and other @entity14 have insisted for months that after president @entity33 was first elected , the @entity2 started unfairly targeting conservative outfits seeking tax - exempt status			1
conservative group takes @entity2 , top @entity33 officials to court @entity8 and his fellow @entity39 argue the @entity2 improperly scrutinized groups on both the left and right as part of a clumsy attempt to administer vague election - related tax laws			1
among other things , @entity8 on friday released slides from a july 2010 workshop powerpoint presentation instructing @entity2 agents to watch for organizations with names like " @entity52 , " " @entity53 , " " @entity54 , " and " @entity55			1
" one of the slides shows a picture of an elephant and a donkey -- the symbols of the @entity14 and @entity39 parties			2
another slide notes a concern that the activities of such groups " may be more than 50 % political , " thereby ruling out the possibility of tax - exempt status under current law			0
' angry ' @entity33 announces @entity2 leader 's ouster notes from the workshop indicated that " if in doubt , " @entity2 staff should " err on the side of caution " and transfer cases to " 7822 , " the @entity2 office in @entity78 responsible for reviewing applications for tax - exempt status			0
the word " progressive " was again cited as an organization name that should trigger a review			0
@entity8 also revealed a may 2013 e-mail from @entity15 's deputy noting that 5,500 internal @entity2 e-mails were reviewed as part of an effort to discover any directing of staff to target " @entity52 and other political organizations , " as well as any subsequent coverup			1
" there was a @entity94 ( @entity93 ) list specifically naming these groups , " the deputy inspector general 's e-mail notes			0
" however , the e-mails indicated the organizations needed to be pulled because the @entity2 employees were not sure how to process them , not because they wanted to stall or hinder the application			0
" the deputy 's e-mail goes on to stress that " there was no indication that pulling these selected applications was politically motivated			1
" in his letter to @entity21 , @entity8 said , " it is unclear why mr. @entity15 failed to disclose this significant information to @entity110			2
" a report released by @entity15 's office in may indicated that lax oversight at the @entity2 allowed for the singling out of some conservative groups			0
@entity15 subsequently testified that he could not specifically identify whether any liberal groups were similarly targeted			2
" this new information underscores the fact that the @entity16 inspector general 's audit was fundamentally flawed and created widespread misperceptions that @entity14 seized on in an effort to attack the @entity11 , " said @entity118 rep. @entity117 , another top @entity11 @entity10			0
" it is now all the more important that inspector general @entity15 return to @entity110 to explain his glaring omissions and reasons for releasing a highly misleading report			0
" a spokesman for @entity21 , however , drew a different conclusion , highlighting the fact that the workshop minutes noted that an @entity2 " @entity52 @entity135 " said that ' @entity55 ' applications are not considered ' @entity134			2
' " " these documents , once again , refute misleading attempts to equate routine scrutiny of other groups involved in advocacy to the systematic scrutiny of @entity52 groups by @entity2 officials , " spokesman @entity136 told @entity137			1
" as has been documented , while 100 % of @entity52 applications were systematically stopped and scrutinized for a 27 - month period , at the same time dozens of progressive applications were approved by the @entity2 , " @entity136 said , referencing a june 26 letter from @entity15 to @entity117			0
in a statement released wednesday , @entity21 said , " @entity2 officials have told committee investigators that they understood @entity52 applications were being isolated from other cases and subjected to extra scrutiny to ensure fair , efficient , and consistent treatment			2
" " the evidence gathered in this investigation makes clear that had @entity156 @entity2 officials simply kept their hands off these cases and allowed employees in the @entity78 office to process applications independently , instead of facing excessive delays , these cases would have been processed just like other advocacy cases , " he concluded .			0
