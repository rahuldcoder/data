-- pure products of @entity2 , " @entity3 " and " @entity4 " were conceived , designed , stretched and pre-tested with one purpose : to lighten billfolds while satisfying mass appetites			1
these two movies seemed especially intent on seizing the wavering attention spans of young people with premises deeply rooted in science - fiction -- or , as some genre lovers might prefer to call it , speculative phantasmagoria			2
same goals , different results			0
@entity21 , in case you had n't heard by now , has exceeded advance expectations by reaping $ 155 million in its first three days of nationwide release			1
that 's the third - highest opening tally in box - office history , just beneath the $ 158.4 million drawn from 2008 's @entity28 sequel , " @entity29 , " and not too far removed from the $ 169.2 million made last summer by " @entity30 and the @entity31 , @entity32 " those latter two features were sequels , while " @entity21 " is just the first installment of what will almost certainly be a trilogy of films made from @entity40 ' phenomenally popular trilogy of books			1
the stories are set in a dystopian future in which a totalitarian society forces teenagers to engage in globally televised ritual murder			0
this means that " @entity21 " made the biggest , fattest opening - weekend nut of any movie that was n't a sequel or spin - off			1
meanwhile , after two weeks in the @entity52 , " @entity4 " continues to tumble in what many believe is a downward spiral of similarly unprecedented dimension			1
@entity57 's lavish , $ 250 million adaptation of the swords - on - @entity59 fantasy novels of @entity61 brought in $ 5 million , increasing its overall box office to $ 62.3 million -- roughly half of which was made in its own opening weekend			2
those using the word " epic " to classify " @entity4 " now use it to describe its estimated $ 200 million shortfall			1
" @entity4 , " for whatever it 's worth , is n't quite as dismal a movie as it is a moneymaker			1
thirty , even 20 years ago , it might have been exotic enough to be taken for pop - cultural innovation			0
now it comes across as a lumbering , good - natured oaf who happened to stumble into the marketplace at the wrong time			0
on the other hand , " @entity3 , " with its reality - tv - on - toxic - drugs premise , is so very much " of its time " that it 's tempting to think much of its imagined future has already arrived			2
( do you feel a draft ? i do			0
) meanwhile , those who approach " @entity4 " with foreknowledge of its box - office crash - and - burn might be surprised to see how charming it can be at times , especially when its eponymous civil war veteran - turned - rhino - riding superhero ( @entity97 ) is adjusting his previously @entity101 - bound muscles to @entity59 gravity			1
in its heedlessly bombastic manner , the movie is faithful to its origins as a rip - snorting romantic fantasy much like @entity61 ' far more famous stories featuring @entity108			0
if the producers were more willing to let @entity111 direct the movie as the garish , live - action comic strip it was meant to be , it might have connected , though not necessarily for a home run			0
but even the decision to call the movie " @entity4 , " instead of " @entity4 " or even " a princess of @entity59 , " the actual title of @entity61 ' first installment of the @entity4 opus , is emblematic of an over-cautiousness that dampens every sequence and set - piece			1
the whole movie feels worked - over , second - guessed , whipped to a thickness that hobbles the movie 's momentum			0
it 's as if " @entity4 " wants you to see every single one of those aforementioned millions of dollars up on the screen			1
and who besides an accountant would care ? the budget of " @entity21 " is an estimated -- and , as with the movie itself , relatively modest -- $ 100 million			1
there are flashy things to see in @entity139 ' movie , from the chompers on @entity142 's unctuous host to the pyrotechnic dress worn by the story 's otherwise ice - cool heroine @entity144 ( @entity146 )			0
but the movie 's adapters , including @entity40 herself , know that the basic story elements have already worked their mojo on their target audience ; even those who have n't read the books likely were drawn by curiosity			0
whatever special effects were marshaled on the movie 's behalf did n't seem as important as how @entity158 would wriggle or shoot her way out of trouble			0
those wishing " @entity21 " had more tragic dimension or made its audience more explicitly feel the sting of its carnage have a point			1
but the movie was n't made for them			0
it was made for the millions of young readers who , for whatever reason , share @entity158 's smoldering resentment of the status quo			2
i 'd like to think that as these young adults of all ages buy their tickets to this speculative phantasmagoria , they retain some suspicion , however vague , that the hype masters who made them flock to the multiplexes on cue over the weekend exert a not - altogether - benign influence over their lives			2
if that 's so , and i 'm not really all that hopeful , it may become harder over time to hurl big , bloated carnivals at them to lighten their wallets			0
even if they 're good - natured , slovenly lugs like " @entity4			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 : " @entity21 , " " @entity4 " exist to make money , appeal to masses
but " *hunger* 's " returns went through the roof , he writes , " @entity4 's " fell through the floor
wildly *expensive* " @entity4 " seems old , he says , while " @entity21 " is of the moment
@entity197 hopes young audiences are aware of @entity2 's hype manipulation
