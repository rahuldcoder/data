after years of controversy , the latest version of the " psychiatric bible " -- the @entity1 -- has been released			1
the @entity5 ( fifth edition ) 's introduction , over the weekend at the @entity8 's annual meeting , marks " the end of more than a decade 's journey in revising the criteria for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders , " the association says on the @entity5 website			1
the manual includes the criteria used by mental health professionals to diagnose patients			1
it 's also used by insurance companies , schools and other agencies responsible for covering and creating special provisions for individuals with developmental or mental disorders			2
the overhaul -- the first for the @entity5 since 1994 -- has not come without opposition from activists , some grass - roots organizations and even the @entity32 , which last month said it was launching a project aimed at laying the foundation for a new classification system and would be " re-orienting its research away from @entity5 categories			1
" are we over-diagnosing mental illness ? here are five ways the @entity5 changes may affect you : bereavement or depression ? previously , clinicians were advised against diagnosing major depression in people within two months after the death of a loved one : the " bereavement exclusion			2
" the @entity5 removes the exclusion , a move the psychiatric association says " helps prevent major depression from being overlooked and facilitates the possibility of appropriate treatment including therapy or other interventions			1
" research has shown that for some people , the death of a loved one can precipitate major depression -- much like other stressors such as losing a job , the association says on the @entity5 website			2
but " bereavement is the only life event and stressor specifically excluded from a diagnoses of major depression " in previous manuals			0
binge eating is officially an eating disorder binge eating was approved as its own category of eating disorder in the @entity5			1
it 's defined as " recurring episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period of time than most people would eat under similar circumstances , with episodes marked by feelings of lack of control			1
" according to the association , the move is aimed at " increasing awareness of the substantial differences between binge eating disorder and the common phenomenon of overeating			1
while overeating is a challenge for many @entity95 , recurrent binge eating is much less common , far more severe , and is associated with significant physical and psychological problems			1
" binge drinkers may be diagnosed as mild alcoholics the revised @entity5 collapses the medical distinction between problem drinking and alcoholism			1
some experts say this could lead college binge drinkers , for example , to be mislabeled as alcoholics , a diagnosis that may follow them into adulthood			1
prior @entity5 editions included " alcohol abuse , " along with the more serious " dependence			0
" however , the @entity5 will make " alcohol use disorder " a single condition			0
" the field of substance abuse and addiction has witnessed an explosion in important research in the past two decades , " said dr. @entity113 , chairman of the @entity114 , in a february statement			0
the changes " reflect the best science in the field and provide new clarity in how to diagnose these disorders			0
" @entity127 's syndrome becomes autism spectrum disorder the proposal to group @entity127 and other developmental conditions together generated a flurry of comments and concerns			1
in 2010 , when the change was proposed , the @entity135 of @entity136 , a nonprofit organization with more than 3,000 members , wrote a letter to the @entity8 emphasizing that @entity127 's should remain separate			0
but " the revised diagnosis represents a new , more accurate , and medically and scientifically useful way of diagnosing individuals with autism - related disorders , " the national group says on the @entity5 website			2
the work group that recommended the change " believes a single umbrella disorder will improve the diagnoses of @entity148 without limiting the sensitivity of the criteria , or substantially changing the number of children being diagnosed			0
" in a statement on its website tuesday , the @entity136 association assures its members , " regardless of your diagnosis or label , we will continue to provide a gathering place where members of the @entity127 's community can connect to one another			0
" doctor : why we 're making changes to autism diagnosis being transgender no longer a mental disorder the @entity5 eliminates the term " gender identity disorder , " which mental health specialists , along with lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender activists , had considered stigmatizing			2
it refers to " gender dysphoria , " which focuses attention only on those who feel distressed by their gender identity			0
" i think it 's a significant change , " @entity181 , a member of the psychiatric association group that recommended the change , said late last year			2
" it 's clinically defensible , but it reduces the amount of stigma and harm that existed before			0
" @entity190 was removed from the @entity5 in 1973 , a move he believes changed global views			0
some lgbt activists applauded the change , while others have questioned whether it goes far enough .			0
