@entity0 may be embroiled in a brutal three - year civil war , but that 's not stopping the government from holding controversial presidential elections this week			1
the election , which has been branded a sham by the @entity7 and by the @entity0 opposition , is widely expected to return president @entity9 to power			1
@entity12 correspondent @entity11 has reported from inside @entity0 numerous times during the conflict , which has left an estimated 150,000 people dead			1
he breaks down the key questions ahead of tuesday 's election			1
why is it happening now ? the government says @entity0 's new constitution stipulates that presidential elections must be held now			1
the regime says it shows the country is moving forward and that it is the first time a president will be elected by the people rather than appointed			2
the opposition says the election is a fraud , that voting will be rigged and that the poll serves only to cement @entity9 's power			1
who are the other candidates ? the other two candidates are relative unknowns			0
one is @entity36 , an entrepreneur and member of parliament			0
he keeps out of the limelight and has not been heard from much			0
@entity36 's election posters declare that " @entity0 is with @entity40 , " which seems like a very narrow slogan			1
other than that it is unclear what he would change should he win			0
the more intriguing candidate is @entity45 , a former economics professor and cabinet minister who told me he had to resign because he was too critical of @entity9 's government			1
@entity45 studied at the @entity49 and still refers to himself as a @entity50			0
he says the election is an uphill battle for him , but feels he is making headway			2
his main message is economic			0
he is for market liberalization and fighting corruption in government and in the private sector			0
but when it comes to fighting @entity0 's civil war , @entity45 says he would n't do anything differently -- and much like @entity9 , he refers to the regime 's three - year assault on the opposition as " fighting terrorism			1
" are they for real ? it 's very hard to tell whether @entity9 's opponents are for real			2
they certainly do n't seem to stand much of a chance , but @entity45 says he is fighting			2
we talked to many people on the streets of @entity74 and @entity75 , and many had never heard of the other two candidates			0
but as far as the campaigns are concerned , both of them are very present			0
there are many @entity36 and @entity45 election posters up in @entity74 , even though there are a lot more for @entity9 's re-election			1
@entity9 's campaign slogan is " unity " and he is trying to portray himself as a reluctant leader who is only running for office again because the people want him to			2
one of his election posters declares , " it is not your choice , the people have chosen you			2
" it is hard to imagine that either candidate has a chance against @entity9 , but their campaigns certainly do not look like they are being repressed			1
what should we look out for ? the big threat is that there could be widespread violence on election day			0
the opposition says the poll is a sham and that it will be a major target			0
early voting at the @entity0 embassy in @entity110 had a massive turnout , but will that be replicated inside the country ? if the turnout is high , that would indicate people in the areas where voting is possible take it seriously -- and opposition candidate @entity45 says the election ca n't be considered valid if turnout is lower than 50 percent			1
will the election be monitored ? @entity0 's deputy foreign minister @entity121 told me there wo n't be any monitors from the @entity125 , the @entity126 , or the @entity127 , but he did say that monitors from " other countries " will be present			1
@entity121 said the presence of monitors would also depend on the security situations in certain parts of the country			0
what percentage of @entity0 will be able to vote ? it 's almost impossible to say			1
nearly 3 million @entity0 have been forced to flee the country and more than 6.5 million are internally displaced			1
it will obviously be difficult for them to vote			0
large swathes of @entity0 's north and northeast , as well as some places in the south , are not under government control and there will be no election in those areas			1
there are some who say people could leave those areas and come over to the government side to vote , but that seems pretty utopian			0
voting will be possible in government - controlled areas , but it is not clear what percentage of the population actually still resides in these places			0
is it dangerous to vote ? it is dangerous to vote in certain places			0
in areas along the @entity0 coast like @entity166 and @entity167 it will not be too dangerous because they are firmly under the control of the government			2
but elsewhere there will be major security concerns as voters will be weary of the threat of car bombs and shelling at polling stations within range of rebel mortars			0
what will change ? it is not clear what , if anything , will change as a result of this election			0
the agreement signed in @entity187 earlier this year called for an inclusive body to govern @entity0 through a transitional period			2
the @entity0 opposition and the @entity7 say the transitional period means that @entity9 must resign -- but while the regime acknowledges that institutions must be reshuffled to accommodate the opposition to some degree , it says @entity9 must stay at the helm			1
if @entity9 wins the election as expected , the prospect of him stepping down as part of a deal would seem even less likely than it does now			1
why would someone " elected by the people " leave his post ? that would be the argument coming out of @entity74			0
and the fact @entity9 now has the upper hand militarily in most places makes it even less likely he 'll step down any time soon .			2
