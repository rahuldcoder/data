when he was on the baseball field , @entity0 was unafraid to fling his body , and his head , into plays -- diving after balls and crashing into outfield walls			1
that fearlessness earned the undersized @entity0 a spot in the big leagues , as well as a raft of concussions			1
now , nearly a year after his death , @entity0 has the distinction of being the first @entity16 player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity18 ) , according to researchers at the @entity20			1
" the real important issue is that he hit his head multiple times -- small hits , big hits , in baseball and outside of baseball , " said @entity21 , co-founder of the @entity22 at @entity23			2
" when it comes to the development of @entity18 , our current sense is that it requires repetitive brain trauma and not just a couple of big concussions			1
" @entity0 committed suicide last december at the age of 36			1
testing of his brain tissue after death -- the only way to definitively diagnose @entity18 -- found that he had @entity43 , which is associated with erratic behavior and memory loss			1
stage 4 , the worst possible expression of the disease , is associated with full - blown dementia , aggression and paranoia			1
the brain tissue of people found to have @entity18 displays an abnormal build - up of tau -- a protein that , when it spills out of cells , can choke off , or disable , neural pathways controlling things like memory , judgment and fear			1
@entity0 's stepfather @entity63 said on sunday that the new diagnosis confirmed what he suspected already			1
" it provides some solace that there is a reason now for @entity0 having done what he did , " @entity63 said			1
" knowing that he 's been suffering for 11 years and that @entity18 is a progressive disease , it gives explanation ( for ) some of the irrational things that he may have done			1
you know , he had a reason			0
" the disease tends to be associated with bruising sports like football and hockey , where repetitive brain trauma is part of the game			1
but @entity0 's case suggests that professional baseball , a somewhat punishing sport in its own right , may have a growing concussion problem			1
" we count everything else			0
we count the at - bats			0
we count the .300 hitter			0
we count the number of pitches and the pitcher can not go more than a certain number of pitches			0
why not count the number of concussions and pay special attention to this like everything else ? " his stepfather said			2
this season , 18 baseball players were placed on the disabled list after concussions -- 10 of them were catchers			2
in 2012 , 13 players were placed on the @entity111 after a concussion , and in 2011 , the number was 11 , according to @entity16 data			2
" i think people do n't realize that baseball players get hurt as much as they do , " said @entity0 's mother , @entity115			1
" @entity16 is just as dangerous " as other sports and , she added , affords players less protection			2
" it 's just a helmet and that 's it			2
" and players wear the helmet only when batting			0
report : former @entity130 player 's body exhumed for brain study " i cringe when i see two guys going after the same ball , " said @entity21 , a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at @entity23 's @entity20			2
" is baseball as significant a concussion sport compared to others ? no. is it a concussion sport ? yes			0
" in a statement issued sunday evening , @entity16 said it was working with experts " to remain proactive on concussions and head injuries			1
" " @entity16 's thoughts remain with @entity0 's family , friends and all those he touched throughout his life , " the league said			1
" @entity0 played baseball with love and passion and made a lasting impression on and off the field			2
we recently met in person with @entity0 's mother and stepfather and expressed to them our feelings about @entity0 and discussed @entity16 's continued efforts to provide a safe environment for our players			1
" in response to increasing concussion diagnoses , the sport is instituting educational programs and rules changes , like a ban on home plate collisions beginning as early as 2014			0
" @entity0 's life and death ought to mean something , and because of him , we can institute changes how baseball is played , " @entity63 said			1
" it 's going to take some time to do it in the major leagues , but certainly we can do something about it next year ... about the kids playing @entity183 and @entity184			0
" @entity0 's mother is unsure whether those types of changes , had they happened sooner , might have altered her son 's fate			1
" it could have , " said @entity115			0
" i think it would have been a good idea if they would have ( educated players )			0
" however , she said , " i do n't think that would have changed his style of play			0
" @entity0 's style was relentless and fierce			1
during his eight - year career with five @entity16 clubs , @entity0 estimated that he had 10 concussions			1
family members say it was likely higher than that			0
his concussion history started young			0
he was only 2 years old when he ran into the side of a moving car			0
age 4 marked the first time that he lost consciousness after a concussion , when he injured himself jumping from a bed			0
he lived life at " one speed , and that was a fast speed , " said his mother			0
suspicions that he could have @entity18 began percolating among family and friends after @entity0 killed himself a year ago			1
but he had had problems for a long time before he died			0
former @entity130 player wants brain studied for several years , he struggled with depression , and drug and alcohol abuse			0
and only months before his death , he and his wife of 11 years divorced			0
these types of problems -- which are echoed in other @entity18 cases -- raise questions about how big a role the disease plays in suicides among players , and how things like pre-existing mental health problems , or post-career adjustment issues , influence the cause of death			1
among the football players who showed signs of the disease and took their own lives are former @entity247 defensive back @entity248 , who shot himself in 2006 ; @entity249 , a former @entity251 offensive lineman who killed himself by drinking antifreeze ; and @entity253 , the former linebacker who killed himself last year at the age of 43			0
former @entity130 players @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 also committed suicide and were later diagnosed with @entity18			2
" if you hit your head a lot , it may increase your risk for this disease , " said @entity21			2
" whether or not the disease was the cause of or accentuated the depression and substance abuse and impulse problems ( @entity0 had ) , we do n't know			2
" but he required more attention and treatment than he got			0
" because of limited data , and a study population that is skewed toward people exposed to repetitive brain trauma , scientists -- including @entity23 researchers -- caution against over-interpreting case studies like @entity0 's			1
" we can learn a lot about diseases by studying these higher - risk populations , " said dr. @entity283 , professor of pathology , immunology and neurology at @entity286 in @entity287			0
" until we know much more about @entity18 , however , it is not possible to generalize about the risk of development even in elite athletes , much less more casual athletes or the population at large			2
" @entity0 's family , including his ex-wife , had said that a @entity18 diagnosis would tie up loose ends emotionally -- and give them much - needed closure			1
@entity115 says a big concern for her is how the @entity18 diagnosis will affect the narrative of @entity0 's life for his three young daughters			1
" he 's gone no matter what , " she said			0
" but i want that closure for his daughters			0
" she wants them to know that he did n't kill himself " because he did n't love them or he did it because he was mad at the world			0
" it was not that way , he was killed ( by the disease )			0
" @entity320 's suicide is latest in a string among former @entity130 players			2

@entity16 says it 's working with experts to *prevent* concussions and head injuries
@entity0 's family says knowing he had @entity18 " provides some solace " after his suicide
chronic traumatic encephalopathy is believed to be a result of repetitive brain trauma
the disease is associated with memory loss , erratic behavior , aggression and paranoia
