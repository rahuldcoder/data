the case against @entity1 involved one count of obstruction of @entity2 , three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury			1
he was not charged with illicit use of performance - enhancing drugs , but his denial of such use was part of the case against him			1
a federal jury found him not guilty on all six counts			0
@entity1 wiped his eyes after the verdict was announced , then hugged his likewise emotional sons			1
his lawyer , @entity25 , meanwhile , gave a thumbs - up to the jury before leaving the courtroom			1
" mr. @entity1 , you 're free to go , " judge @entity29 said			2
minutes later , @entity1 thanked his family , lawyers and others who have supported him during the trial and in the years since he was accused of using illicit performance enhancing drugs			2
" i put a lot of hard work into ( my ) career , " he told reporters , choking up on the steps of the federal courthouse in @entity40			1
" i appreciate my teammates that came in , and all the e-mails and phone calls			0
" @entity25 thanked the jury , and lavished praise on his client for his demeanor and character			0
" it has been 4Â½ years since we listened to a picture that does n't match up at all with the man we have grown to know and love , " the lawyer said			0
" he is not only a seven - time @entity59 winner , he 's a hell of a man			1
" @entity63 's suspension overturned members of the @entity67 attorney 's office in the @entity40 said little about the verdict monday afternoon , beyond thanking the jury and investigators in a brief statement			0
" we respect the judicial process and the jury 's verdict , " the @entity67 attorney 's office said			0
six days earlier , federal prosecutor @entity77 told jurors in closing arguments that @entity1 " wanted to protect his brand , he wanted to protect his livelihood , " in denying the use of steroids during a 2008 investigation by the @entity67 @entity85 into the problem			2
the @entity1 defense team disputed whether the government had made its case , telling the jury all the evidence came through a former personal trainer , @entity92 , who had incentive to lie			1
" you saw @entity92 , the only witness in the history of the world who says he gave or saw an injection of that man , " said defense attorney @entity94			0
" one person in the entire world			0
" during closing arguments , the defense cited the lack of corroborating witnesses			0
it took about eight weeks for the prosecution and defense to question 46 witnesses , and the most direct conflict came among expert witnesses as to how to interpret a collection of discarded medical items that allegedly linked @entity1 to steroid use			1
the pitcher did not take the stand in his defense			0
soiled medical wrappings , cotton balls , drug vials and hypodermic needles that @entity92 kept were interpreted differently by each side			0
witnesses for the government said genetic material linked with @entity1 suggested it was impossible for @entity92 to fabricate the evidence			1
but defense witnesses on the same topic said storage in a beer can for years allowed commingling and contamination of materials , making reliable conclusions impossible , and the evidence nearly worthless			2
@entity135 senior legal analyst @entity134 said a big part of @entity1 ' defense was , in essence , putting @entity2 on trial -- claiming they were never serious about using whatever testimony was given to shape future legislation			1
" he was basically saying , @entity2 was putting on a show			2
they did n't care , " @entity134 said of @entity25			0
" they just wanted @entity1 to come up there , they were n't planning to do anything with the testimony			2
" this was the second trial for @entity1			2
about a year ago , a mistrial was declared before the case reached the jury			1
the government 's lawyers played video evidence the judge had already banned			0
prosecutors said it was an editing mistake , but the @entity1 defense team suggested prosecutors were unprepared and had gotten off to a bad start			2
the verdict comes six months after @entity165 got two years of probation and 30 days of house arrest for obstruction of justice in a federal steroids - related case and days after federal prosecutors dropped all remaining charges against former @entity175 presidential candidate @entity174 , less than two weeks after his corruption trial ended in an acquittal and mistrial			1
" it was not a great case , but this is a real blow to the @entity184 , " @entity134 said of prosecutors ' case against @entity1			2
@entity185 banned from world @entity187 events over doping probe known as " the rocket , " @entity1 was among the most accomplished pitchers of his generation , earning seven @entity59 awards as his league 's best pitcher and 11 all - star appearances before retiring in 2007			1
he was known for his blazing fastball -- his 4,672 strikeouts are the third most of any @entity200 pitcher -- as well as his excellence over all stages of his 24 - year career			1
but the @entity205 native made news for a different reason in 2007 , when he was among a number of baseball stars -- along with others including @entity165 , @entity211 and @entity212 -- in an investigation by @entity200 into the illicit use of performance - enhancing drugs			0
that investigation was led by former @entity67 senator @entity217			0
yet despite being accused by his longtime former trainer , @entity1 has consistently and strongly denied using steroids			0
that includes comments he made during the 2008 congressional hearing delving into the @entity223 and later in reaction to his six - count indictment			0
@entity25 , the now - 49 - year - old pitcher 's lawyer , bemoaned how people labeled his client arrogant because he denied using performance - enhancing drugs			1
he insisted monday that @entity232 -- who will become eligible for entry into baseball 's hall of fame next year -- " from ( age ) 16 to 45 was the same person			0
" " i hope those in the public that made up their mind ( about @entity1 ' steroid use ) before there was a trial will now back up and entertain the possibility of what he 's always said : using steroids and @entity248 is cheating , and is totally contrary to his entire career , " said @entity25 .			1

@entity1 ' lawyer says his client has always *believed* steroid use is " cheating "
the 7 - time @entity59 winner says he " put a lot of hard work " into his baseball career
he was charged with obstruction of @entity2 , making false statements and perjury
