-- " it takes a special person not to barf in the trash bag			2
" welcome to the glamorous life of the sailing drone operator			1
justice @entity6 , 26 , lives in @entity7 and shoots video profiles of some of the world 's most expensive private yachts			1
but it does come at the cost of wearing a black bag on your head			2
" sometimes , i fly the drone with my head in a trash bag so i do n't get salt spray from the sea on my equipment , " @entity6 explains			2
" i 'm inside the bag , looking at my monitor and basically playing a video game -- watching that screen and securing myself so i do n't get thrown around			1
we go out in the craziest conditions , and the @entity30 winds are really strong			2
" if @entity6 is n't the most appealing sight , out on deck in a black bag , his footage is a different story			2
drones have revolutionized what is possible with a camera , but rarely does the end product match this vista of superyachts and @entity30 seas			1
" it 's just a perspective you never really see , " says @entity6			2
" you can either charter a helicopter to come out for an hour for a thousand euros , or i can come out			2
" how much do i cost ? it really depends on what you want			2
in some cases , it 's more			0
but i can get shots and angles a normal helicopter ca n't get			0
" on the low end , i 'm putting about $ 3,500 in the air			1
on the high end , up to $ 35,000			1
that would be an octocopter with a @entity61 camera and a three - axis stabilized gimbal , with a two - man operation			1
" @entity6 began flying drones as a hobby , then developed a passion for yachts when he spent two years working on board the 88m - long @entity69 , one of the largest private yachts in the world			1
all of the technology he uses is custom - built , based on skills he picked up following in his brother 's footsteps as a child			1
older brother @entity78 was one of the early pro video gamers , picking up awards -- and tens of thousands of dollars -- as a professional quake 3 player at the turn of the millennium			1
he now works with @entity84 , a 31 - year - old @entity85 cinematographer , on larger projects -- of which there are many in a @entity30 racing season teeming with stunning yachts and proud owners			1
" people spend this crazy amount of money to have everyone come and race in @entity98 or @entity7 , " says @entity6 , " so they want something everyone can relate to and enjoy having			1
" drones are not limited to the rarefied air of the superyacht club			1
some of the world 's leading sailing organizations have been experimenting with similar technology in the hope of transforming the way the sport is shown on tv			1
" if we do n't have a tv viewer - ready product , where does that put us in our livelihoods here ? we 've got to get on board , " says @entity118 , who works with the 49er sailing class			1
@entity121 has been at the forefront of plans to launch a new " theater - style " version of sailing , which sees races take place along short , compact courses -- making the action much easier to shoot , and simpler to show on tv			1
he argues that 's vital for the sport 's future , in a world where @entity136 sports are judged on their ability to captivate a global audience			1
" we 've used drones quite a bit , " says @entity118			1
" one of the limitations is the range but , if we have a shorter course and only a 10 - minute race , it 's pretty doable now for a drone to stay in the air for that			1
" we can film an entire race cheaply and simply , and you get great perspective			0
" @entity153 piloted the drones at this year 's @entity156 junior world championships			1
he argues this line of work is an art form , about more than simply putting a camera in the air			0
" everybody can film from above , but i want pictures from places where it 's not normally possible to take them , " says @entity153			0
" to get the drone out in front of the boat by one or two meters , that 's the difficult part			0
it 's as difficult to get the shot as it is with a normal camera , there are so many variables			0
i 'm not always happy about my work -- sometimes you get it , sometimes you do n't			0
" my advantage is i 've been a pro sailor and sailed a lot of different boats			0
so 99 times out of 100 , i know what the sailor is going to do			0
i can place my drone in the right spot because i can predict what will happen			0
" there is one obvious danger when you have thousands of dollars in equipment in mid-air , hovering above the ocean between fast - moving boats			1
" i 've been close sometimes , " laughs @entity153 , when asked how often drones have ditched in the sea or collided with vessels			2
" i made an agreement with myself that if i lose one every year , it 's ok			0
" i 've seen some of the other guys and they 're hanging 30m away and do n't want to get too close , because it 's dangerous			0
but you have to get close , otherwise you ca n't get those pictures			0
" @entity121 's recent efforts to convince sailing 's main governing body , @entity205 , to adopt his new , tv - friendly theater - style format have failed			1
at a conference in early november , the organization 's top executives voted down the plans			0
that leaves him frustrated , but determined to convince the powers - that - be that this way of capturing his sport is the future			1
" i think it 's a hugely wasted opportunity			0
if it 's not this , it 's got to be something else			0
the way sailing 's going , we 're on a tough road , " he says			2
meanwhile , @entity6 is pressing on with new tricks in a world he says is always changing			0
" we 're going to switch to remote - control airplanes , " says @entity6			2
" it 's cheaper because a quadcopter has four motors , whereas an airplane only has one , and it can fly longer			0
battery life is a big issue right now			0
with an airplane you can kill the motors , glide and hang out for a long time			0
" every couple weeks , there 's stuff that 's coming out			0
there 's a really good community called @entity245 and that 's like my bible , pretty much			0
" custom - building is where it 's at			1
i customize everything , it 's all completely ripped apart and put back together			0
but there are off - the - shelf solutions			2
" it depends on how perfect you want it to be			0

@entity7 - based *filmmaker* shoots video profiles of superyachts using drones
custom - built drones costing between $ 3,500 and $ 35,000 are used for the job
sailing organizations hope drones can help to make the sport tv - friendly
