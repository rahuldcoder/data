-- fifty - two years ago , the survivors of the @entity2 in @entity3 revealed a few things to the world about the brutality of survival in the depths			1
without food or water , cut off in every way from life on the surface , in a world lighted only by the head - lamps on their helmets until the batteries died and left them in profound darkness , the men struggled to escape and then prepared to die			1
psychologists , academics and journalists swamped the 18 men upon their miraculous rescue to hear their tales , take down their personal histories , and administer iq and personality tests			1
these intensive examinations , repeated at yearly intervals , allowed experts to sketch a few conclusions about the psychology of group survival when hope , like light , is gone			0
the rescue of the @entity40 miners -- which ended this week in jubilation as every one of them ascended , healthy and sound , to the surface -- represents a triumph of space - age ingenuity and technology			1
it would have been unthinkable half a century ago			0
here is what happened then			0
at 8:06 p.m. october 23 , 1958 , in @entity50 , @entity3 , one of the deepest coal mines on @entity53 collapsed , with 174 men underground			1
eighty - one men struggled to the surface , battered but alive and speaking of horrors below			1
ninety - three were missing			1
fallen rock blocked access to the depths ; the mine had sealed up as if it had never existed			1
the world was watching : the @entity2 was the world 's first live - television - broadcast news event			1
hundreds of people -- families , reporters , cameramen , officials and onlookers -- mobbed the mouth of the mine			1
in @entity50 , each rescuer crawled on his belly into the collapsed mine with a hand - ax , chipped away at the rock , filled a bucket , passed it back to the man lying behind him , who passed it to the next man in line , and in that painstaking way , a single bucket of rocks reached the surface			1
those workers encountered only the crushed bodies of their comrades			0
families buried their loved ones ; those without recovered bodies planned memorial services			0
but the mine had collapsed in such a way as to create two air pockets , two caves not much bigger than closed freight elevators			1
in one cave a mile below the surface , seven men awoke from the crash in rock prisons ; at a deeper elevation , 12 men found themselves walled in together			1
neither group heard the other			0
on wednesday in @entity40 , the rescued mine foreman spoke of the worst moment underground : when the dust settled , the men were able to look around and see their predicament			1
the same was true in @entity50			0
coming to consciousness after the double earthquake of the collapse , lighting their head lamps , the men in each cave were staggered by the extent of the destruction			1
these men had known the underground walkways and tunnels as well as their own neighborhoods ; now , all was twisted beyond recognition			2
immediately , they began to search for an exit : they pried into every cranny and felt their way along jagged walls			0
in each group , a natural leader emerged			0
each of the leaders ( the researchers later concluded ) was a man short on words and poorly educated , handy with equipment , with a good navigational sense but poor interpersonal skills , confident that he would find or chop a way out			2
following his lead , the other miners jury - rigged tools from broken pieces , chipped at the walls , hungrily ate leftover dinners and drank from canteens			1
other men privately wondered whether the food and water ought to be preserved and rationed in case escape was more than a few hours away , but they said nothing			2
the energy and optimism of the dexterous leaders lasted for about three days and gave out along with the food , water and lamp batteries			0
in @entity40 , love moves the sun and stars on the third day , even the crumbs were gone , canteens were dry , and head lamps blinked off			1
this was the deepest darkness on @entity53			2
the handyman leaders sat down and gave up			0
in the darkness , with no projects and work to distract them , the men could no longer avoid sad thoughts			1
they missed their families terribly and feared that the mine owners would n't take care of their widows and children			2
one man was heartened because it was monday morning , so his daughter must be in school			2
then he realized that the mine disaster probably caused the schools to close , and he felt lonely again , not knowing where his daughter was			2
men longed to take back words spoken in anger			2
one realized he 'd taken a couple of little things from a friend 's shop with the intention of paying a few days later			2
now , he 'd never be able to pay ; now , it was as if he 'd stolen from his friend			0
one man quietly wondered whether the other fellows knew that he had been born out of wedlock ; he 'd spent his life protecting the secret that he was a " bastard			2
" then thirst came on and blotted out almost everything else on their minds : it seemed to turn their tongues to wood and cracked their lips and scraped their throats raw			0
the men pooled their urine in a bucket and used bits of cloth to moisten their lips			2
now , in both groups , new leaders arose			0
these ( the researchers later determined ) were more educated , had higher iqs and better interpersonal skills			0
they offered no escape plans and were not equipment experts			0
in the gassy pitch - black pits , their quiet voices sounded fatherly and moderate ( one was the father of 12 )			1
they were not panicking ; they still had hope			0
their peaceful voices -- they spoke a little bit about @entity238 , a little bit about their certainty that rescuers were looking for them -- calmed the other men			2
just being in the company of these thoughtful and kind men comforted the rest			2
another remarkable thing happened underground , and it was that conventional social barriers fell			2
in one of the groups , the second leader , the sharer of hope , was @entity254			0
@entity256 , others worked beside him cheerfully enough -- this was not the @entity258 -- but he 'd always felt himself held at bay			0
his family never socialized with any of theirs ; their wives were not friends			0
he , almost alone among the miners , could n't be said to have a best buddy on the crew			0
but now , in the dark , when only his deep and calm voice stood among them , race was a non-issue			0
he was more than equal			0
they looked to him as a leader			0
the rescue of the trapped miners after five days for the group of 12 and seven days for the group of six ( a lone man was found alive elsewhere ) was celebrated worldwide with breaking news reports , live footage and jubilation			1
a few miners accepted an invitation to appear on " the @entity284 " in @entity285			0
all of them traveled with their families to @entity288 , @entity289 , at the state of @entity289 's expense , to relax and recuperate			0
how will @entity40 miners fare psychologically ? but there , the realities of life on the @entity53 's surface returned with a vengeance			1
@entity289 was segregated ; only one motel , solely for whites , existed on @entity288			0
though the miners flew together to @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity289 authorities transported them to @entity288 in a white - only bus and a black - only bus , the latter exclusively for the @entity309 - @entity308 miner and his family			1
his fellow miners protested , but the black miner , @entity315 , insisted that he and his family would have a fine vacation ( though they were housed in a trailer far from the hotel ) , and he urged everyone to relax and enjoy			1
the white vacationers enjoyed fishing trips , restaurants and a football game , while the @entity309 - @entity308 family was entertained privately in the homes of black residents			1
thus was the fellowship that existed underground -- between black and white , educated and uneducated , those of legitimate birth and those born " out of wedlock " -- gradually dissolved by the bright light of day			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity336 .			1

@entity336 writes about @entity308 mine collapse that captured world 's attention
*20* men were trapped in darkness with no high - tech gear to free them , *unlike* @entity40 miners
social structure formed ; soon , a black man took lead , in contrast with his *aboveground* status
@entity354 : miners rescued , racial *division* *resurfaced* too ; fellowship dissolved in daylight
