@entity0 , @entity1 -- everyone here has a clear memory of what summer should be : white sand beaches busy from sunup to sundown ; the souvenir shop running out of bikinis , boogie boards , airbrushed sand dollars and decorative hermit crab shells ; more stop than go on the two - lane road that cuts through the island ; more bathing suits than socks in the wash			1
there should be a wait for martinis at @entity23 , a wait for oysters at the @entity27 lounge , a wait for coffee at @entity30 , a wait for fresh snapper at @entity33			2
it is summer in name only on this narrow band of beaches			1
after oil spilled from a @entity41 well and flowed toward @entity1 's panhandle , almost no tourists came to stay			1
residents are losing their jobs			2
they 're learning it does n't matter if the sand looks pristine at the moment ; oil slick and tar balls could return at any time , and people are afraid			1
" bartenders are trained to hear people 's problems , make them feel better , but every single person that comes in here has the same problem , " said @entity51 , who opened the jellyfish here four years ago , and usually pays his bills for the year with money earned during summer but ca n't afford to this year			1
" the stress -- they ca n't sleep , everybody 's irritated , everybody 's on edge			1
i 'm tired of thinking about it			2
" @entity0 , @entity1 , has a reputation as the place to unwind , a haven from bigger , busier @entity72 , @entity1 , and @entity73 , @entity74 , just down the road			1
its name translates to " @entity30 , " and it 's home to about 2,000 full - time residents , 3,400 rental condos and not a single hotel			1
more than half its area is taken up by undeveloped state and national parkland			2
tourism is its greatest economy , and untouched beaches its best selling point			1
after the @entity90 oil rig exploded in april , calls flooded the cozy visitor center inside the island fire station			1
at first , tourism officials assured people that crude gushing from the well was a faraway problem			1
as oil began to wash up on other shores , they promised that the coast of @entity1 's panhandle was clear			1
when it crept closer , they confirmed only what they 'd seen that day -- and that most condos were eliminating the cancellation fees			1
but eventually , the calls stopped coming altogether			2
more than 4,100 people came through the visitor center 's doors in june 2003 , its busiest recent year			0
in june 2010 , only 1,446 stopped by			0
boom and cleanup crews surrounded the shores			0
local business owners braced themselves for catastrophic loss of income			0
families wept while they watched reports that warned oil was coming closer			1
it was disastrous news for businesses that sustain themselves all year on their @entity126 - to - @entity129 revenue			1
and it was the same story around the rest of the @entity132 , oiled or not : an analysis by @entity134 for the @entity135 said the spill could affect the @entity132 's travel industry up to three years and cost up to $ 22.7 billion			0
" i think we all envisioned @entity142 's @entity141 was going to cover the white beach , " said @entity138 , who has lived and sold real estate on @entity0 for nearly two decades			1
perhaps thanks to wind , tide or luck , @entity0 stayed mostly clear , even while massive tar balls washed up on nearby @entity148			1
the slick on the horizon receded within a few days , and sticky brown clumps were cleaned up quickly , quietly			0
even now , the only obvious signs of continued cleanup are occasional daytime crews			0
in the earliest hours of the morning , well before sunrise , heavy pieces of construction equipment bathe the beach in red and white light			0
this was supposed to be a big year for the @entity161			0
many of the homes , businesses and condos were freshly built or newly renovated after @entity166 destroyed parts of the @entity1 and @entity74 coasts in 2004			1
the economy had recovered enough that rentals were filling up , and home sales were increasing every month			0
" you could just feel it			0
this was it , " said @entity138 , vice chairwoman of the @entity174			0
" everything you see is tough and had already been through a pretty strong test			0
we all had reason to think everything would be just grand			0
" some blame national media for replaying early images of oil - soaked birds and boom - lined shores , which do n't reflect beaches like @entity0 's , they say			1
but even locals disagree about whether it 's safe to go in the water			0
tar balls still wash up on shore at times , and when cleanup workers dig a few inches in the sand , it 's stained yellow by oil			1
on @entity209 , part of the @entity206 popular with locals and tourists , lifeguards counted about 50 people on a late july morning and called it one of the busiest days yet this season			0
all summer , kids who grew up on sand castles and saltwater have been relegated to lawns and pools			0
" no , you 're not going in the deep water , " @entity0 resident @entity217 called to her 6 - year - old son as he splashed in the @entity132			1
after days of begging , they 'd returned to the beach for the first time in weeks			0
but the kids had new rules : no deeper than their knees , and they had to be extra careful not to swallow water , for fear of ingesting oil and dispersants			1
there were no health advisories in effect , but signs and a flier handed out at the entryway told people to avoid the sand and water if they saw any oil			2
" normally they 'd be all the way in , swimming , snorkeling			0
i 'm still hesitant about letting them go , " @entity244 said as she looked over the umbrellas scattered on the sand			0
" i 've never seen it like this			0
" as the unofficial end to summer draws closer , @entity0 residents are looking for ways to salvage what 's left of the season -- for business , and for themselves			1
to prove the state of the shores , the visitor center posts near - daily videos of clear , gentle water lapping against a perfect , empty beach			2
they tout discounted condo rates , shorter rental periods and non-gulf beaches along the @entity267			1
they launched new pages on @entity270 , and planned tournaments and festivals that might spark some interest			0
they proposed a campaign to give as many as 120 families a free place to stay on @entity0 , but @entity1 tourism officials said it did n't follow @entity41 's guidelines for how to spend marketing money			1
still , they 're looking for grants to launch the promotion , because they know crowds draw more			0
even a @entity286 vacation planned for president @entity287 and his family in august could provide a boost			0
the summer that was n't is quickly coming to a close			2
kids are watching the school calendars , and workers are impatiently waiting for @entity41 claim checks to tide them over			2
nobody was spending much money on entertainment this summer , but most wednesday nights , about 80 people gathered on the beach to pray for themselves , the community and the summer they 've lost			0
" what separates this from a hurricane is the idea that you can come in , clean it up and move forward , " said @entity303 , senior pastor of the @entity304 , who leads the weekly service by the shore			0
" there are things in our lives we ca n't fix with a simple phone call or the writing of a check			2
" it 's that question mark -- we are as stable as the blowing wind			0
" @entity303 said @entity0 will struggle the rest of the year with money , stress and questions unanswered			1
but he expects to see a more gracious community at the end , one that survived the un-summer of the oil spill together			2
still , the beach wo n't be the thing to carry them through ; @entity303 plans to halt his shoreside service in mid-august			2
like everyone else here , he knows you ca n't expect a crowd after @entity129 .			2

@entity0 , @entity1 , did n't see as much oil as other nearby tourism - driven places
businesses still suffered , laid off workers or closed down
beaches are open , but few visitors are renting condos , even at reduced rates
