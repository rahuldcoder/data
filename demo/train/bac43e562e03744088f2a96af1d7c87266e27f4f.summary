-- @entity1 released a new version of its questions feature on thursday , the result of nearly a year of beta testing			1
the new version of @entity3 takes the focus off public inquiries ( a service already dominated by q&a sites like @entity10 ) and instead focuses on soliciting recommendations from friends			1
" there are a lot of places you can go on the internet to ask questions of people who you do n't know , but there are very few places you can go to get responses from your friends , " said @entity13 , a project manager for questions			1
" we thought that this is where we should focus			0
" the updated version will be rolled out to current testers first			1
when they start asking questions , the feature will automatically be pushed to their friends			2
those who do n't want to wait for a friend to ask a question on their profile in order to use the new feature can download it here			0
for now , the feature is only available in @entity44			0
here 's a quick look at the new product : asking a question when asking a question , users have an option to create a poll with restricted answers or one that allows anybody to add answers			2
the latter option is helpful if , for instance , they want to ask their friends for restaurant recommendations			1
generally , this type of question only requires a short answer , but it 's not as though there are a limited number of options			2
friends can add their favorite restaurants to the answer list easily , and if they have something else to say can write it in an attached comment section			2
for questions that do n't work with a poll format ( i.e. " can we have a long discussion about the meaning of life ? " ) , this comment section becomes the answer section			0
when we last checked in on the product in july , wall posts about questions merely referenced isolated pages where friends could respond			2
now questions can be answered and commented on within newsfeeds and profile pages			0
when a friend participates , the question is also posted to his or her profile page			0
hypothetically , a compelling question could spread to every @entity1 user in this way			1
answering a question as users respond , each option 's box fills to reflect its popularity			0
this way , viewers see the poll questions and results at the same time			0
@entity1 also displays the profile photos of respondents next to the options they select			1
more on social media from @entity0 when users are adding an option to a poll - style question , @entity1 prepopulates a drop - down menu with corresponding @entity1 pages			1
one of these pages can be tacked to the answer so that other users can see a preview window of that page			0

@entity1 's new version is the result of nearly a year of beta testing
version focuses on soliciting recommendations from friends
updated version will be rolled out to current testers first
