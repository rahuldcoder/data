@entity0 -- members of the @entity3 and @entity4 armed services committees currently are talking to the @entity6 about the next round of hearings on @entity9 , trying to coordinate sessions with the @entity12 commander there , gen. @entity11			1
when @entity11 , probably the best - known military man in the wars of @entity15 and @entity9 , returns to answer questions , the television lights will shine on the four stars he wears on each shoulder			1
now a new debate is swirling in @entity0 , thanks to an opinion piece in the @entity22 pushing for @entity11 to get a fifth star , like military giants of the past			1
" the @entity12 war against terrorism is now the longest war in @entity12 history , and @entity11 has clearly distinguished himself as a leader worthy of the rank held by @entity31			1
@entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , " @entity32 and @entity33 , of the group @entity34 , wrote in the @entity22			1
@entity32 served in @entity15 with the @entity38 and is bound for @entity9			0
@entity33 , a @entity39 , deployed twice to @entity15			0
they make the case that @entity11 deserves the higher rank and that others will benefit if he gets it			1
" a promotion would properly honor his service -- and it would also honor the troops he leads and has led , " they write			0
" today 's soldiers have fought as valiantly as any in @entity12 history , and they deserve recognition of their leaders			2
congressional approval of a fifth star would demonstrate the nation 's commitment to their mission			1
" @entity32 aid thursday that the response to their suggestion has been overwhelmingly positive			0
he laughed off a question about whether he had heard from @entity11 himself , saying he did n't expect to			1
" we 're just hoping to gain some traction , " @entity32 said			0
he said congressmen already have volunteered to push the promotion forward , although he said he could not provide names			0
a spokesman for @entity11 would not discuss the idea with @entity1			1
most senior officers are selected by a promotion board of their peers			0
but for three - stars and above , the president makes the choice , and the @entity3 must confirm the decision			0
right now , including @entity11 , there are only 12 four - star generals in the @entity79			1
currently , there is no legislation allowing the appointment of officers to a five - star grade , according to @entity6 information			2
the last general receiving a fifth star was @entity88 in 1950 , and it took a special law to make that happen			2
sen. @entity92 , @entity94 - @entity93 , recommended a fifth star during a congressional hearing back in 2008 , when @entity11 was leading the surge of troops in @entity15			1
" if i could promote you to five stars , i would , " @entity92 told @entity11			1
the issue prompted tweets to @entity1 's @ natlsecuritycnn account			1
" an incredibly silly idea , " says one answer to the question of the fifth star			1
" as much as @entity107 want to deify him he 's not a @entity0 or a @entity109 , " says another			1
a supporter tweets , " he deserves by his achievements			2
" in the halls of the @entity6 , people shied away from questions			0
asked about how the nuts and bolts of the promotion would work , one @entity6 worker admitted that it has been so long since @entity88 that he did n't even know whom to call			0
another person , back from the battlefield , shrugged it all off			0
" most people do think it 's laughable , " he said			0
he did n't want to have his name tagged to any comment about a past or future boss			0
the latest publicity is an echo of a call to elevate @entity11 : a july article in the @entity133 magazine			2
the author , @entity134 , a former @entity135 paratrooper who served in @entity9 , said that another star for @entity11 would give president @entity137 a chance to convince the @entity12 military and allies that he 's committed to the mission in @entity9			1
" if you are wearing a uniform right now , and i talk to soldiers every day , there 's a great deal of fear out there , a great deal of suspicion			0
president @entity137 needs a bit of bolstering in the military , " @entity134 said			0
" @entity11 is deified in the military			1
it 's win - win			0
with this there is no doubt that the world will appreciate we are taking it seriously in @entity9			0
" critics of an additional star for @entity11 warn that it could interfere with the chain of command			1
he would outrank his superior at @entity161 , @entity39 gen. @entity162 , as well as the @entity164 chairman , adm. @entity163			0
but @entity32 says that should cause no problem , that @entity11 ' stature already means he has direct contact with the @entity4 and @entity168 and the secretary of defense			2
@entity170 in commentary magazine praises @entity11 but opposes the promotion , saying it would have a negative impact on the chain of command			2
" i do think that when @entity11 is ready for retirement -- something that i hope will not happen anytime soon -- @entity168 should consider granting him another star if by that point he has turned around the war in @entity9 as he did in @entity15 , " boot writes on @entity181			1
there are no such concerns from @entity134			0
" it 's just the nature of war today , " he said			0
" @entity11 and @entity191 are on equal footing			2
... if @entity11 dropped dead tomorrow , hit by a stray bullet , or retired there is not another unifying force to speak out about the war in @entity9 , the war in @entity15			2

a @entity22 opinion piece says @entity11 deserves a fifth star
it " would demonstrate the nation 's commitment " to the military , the authors say
tweets : " an incredibly silly idea " ; " he 's not a @entity0 " ; " he deserves " it
