this weekend , he and his crew of three found quite a few " needles " in their oceanic " haystack " -- 48 gold coins that date back 300 years , to be exact			1
the coins , called escudos , were part of the treasure aboard a fleet of 11 @entity21 galleons wrecked by a hurricane off the @entity24 coast on july 31 , 1715			1

the coins appear to be in good condition , and still have some legible dates and markings			2
the oldest bears the date 1697 ; the youngest is dated 1714			1
the 48 coins have an estimated value of $ 200,000 to $ 250,000 , said @entity1			1
perhaps the most surprising thing about the expedition is that the coins were found just 100 feet from the shoreline , in only six feet of water			2
ancient coins could change history of @entity42 though @entity1 admits his work is exciting , he says it 's not like you see in the movies			0
" you may expect to see a big galleon on its side with treasure chests overflowing , but it 's not like that at all , " he said			1
" with shipwrecks that old , most of the organic material like the actual wood of the ship is gone , due to deterioration			0
what 's left are mostly metals and pottery ... china , silver buckles , bronze cannons and gold coins			1
" the coins will be sold to private collectors and the money raised from the sale will finance further searching of the wreckage site , @entity1 said			2
