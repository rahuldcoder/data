@entity0 -- eight @entity3 officials have been fired or suspended after five boys died in a rubbish bin after suffocating on fumes from charcoal they burned to stay warm , according to state - run media			1
the bodies of the boys , aged between 9 and 13 , were found by a trash collector on friday in @entity14 in @entity17 's southwestern @entity16 province , @entity10 reported			1
they are believed to have died the night before , as rain fell and temperatures plunged to as low as six degrees @entity21 ( 43 degrees @entity22 )			2
six officials have lost their jobs , including the principals of two local schools and four government officials in charge of education and civil affairs in @entity32 district where @entity14 is located			2
two deputy heads from the same departments were also suspended pending an investigation			2
users on @entity17 's social media platforms expressed shock and disgust , with some questioning how society could have allowed such young children to fall through the cracks			1
one user on @entity44 , @entity17 's version of @entity45 , wrote : " @entity17 is supposedly an intermediate developed country but still ca n't protect its own children			1
at the age when they should be enjoying a happy childhood these poor kids are wandering and dying on the streets			0
" ( @ @entity52 ) another said : " i just ca n't believe this is a story happening in my country today ... where are the " relevant departments " doing on this ? and " where are the kids ' parents ? why give birth to children and then abandon them ? " ( @ @entity64 ) days after their deaths , details of the boys ' lives emerged in local press			1
they all belonged to the same extended family , the sons of three brothers			1
two of the fathers , @entity74 and @entity76 , were rural migrants , who had moved from @entity16 to the special economic zone of @entity79 near the @entity0 border , where they worked as rubbish collectors			0
the other father , @entity83 , a poor man who was said to work long hours tending fields , told @entity10 that he and his wife paid little attention to their own son , let alone their nephews			0
" sometimes they did n't even come home at night , " he said			0
persistent truants , the boys were said to have been missing for three weeks before they were found dead			2
" at first , i sent ( my son ) back to school by force , " @entity83 said			0
" but every time he 'd run away again , so i knew it was hopeless			0
" there are estimated to be more than 150,000 street children in @entity17 , according to official figures quoted by @entity10			1
however , @entity101 of @entity17 said up to 1.5 million children were thought to be fending for themselves across the country but , given the fluid nature of homelessness , it was hard to keep track			1
@entity101 says the presence of street children is obvious in some cities , but it 's safe to assume that many remain in rural towns , the byproduct of a huge demographic shift in @entity17 , as parents move to booming cities for work			1
" it 's not uncommon to see several children living in a household with an elderly couple in rural @entity17			1
these are the left behind children			2
right now people are coping the best they can , " @entity101 said			0
it 's estimated there are 55 million " left behind " children in @entity17 , the sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved to the cities for a better life			1
" we would say in @entity136 that that 's one of the most significant challenges for @entity17 right now , because all the data shows these children have lower nutrition , suffer a higher rate of accidents and injuries and are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation , " @entity101 said			1
state media reported that four of the five boys found dead in the dumpster were being cared for by their aging , blind grandmother who had difficulty caring for herself			1
a local resident told @entity155 that neighbors had noticed the boys wandering the streets			0
" they took a shabby shed in a construction site near the dumpster and ate some discarded vegetables in the market and played football that they had picked up , " he said			0
last year , @entity17 's @entity167 launched a nationwide campaign to return " vagrant " children to their homes			1
once sent back , the children would be placed in government - run shelters , according to @entity10			0
" street orphans should be placed in the care of welfare institutions or foster families if their guardians can not be found , " the article said , quoting the vice minister of civil affairs			0
despite efforts to pull millions out of poverty in @entity17 over recent decades , the country still lacks modern child welfare systems seen in the @entity185 , @entity101 said			2
" the concept of social workers , for instance , which is quite well known in @entity189 and @entity190 , is very , very new in @entity17			2
@entity17 's aware of this and there are many efforts in place right now to professionalize the whole system of social workers , to introduce alternatives to institutionalization , or just sending children to a state orphanage , which traditionally has been the main response to these kinds of situations , " he said			1
an opinion piece published wednesday in @entity205 asked whether authorities were too quick to lay the blame on local officials and suggested that major changes were needed to reduce the number of " left behind children			1
" " this tragedy is a wake - up call that something needs to be done to improve the working and living conditions of migrant workers , so they can settle in the cities where they work and enjoy the same rights as their urban counterparts			0
this would enable them to have their children live with them , " it said			0
the plight of the dead children in @entity16 has been compared on social media to the tale of the @entity232 , a @entity233 story of a girl ignored by the rich who froze to death after trying to warm herself with a lit match			0
on wednesday , messages of condolences for the five boys were still being posted on @entity44			0
" hope they wo n't feel cold anymore in heaven , " @ @entity242 said			0
@ @entity245 added : " rest in peace , do n't reincarnate in @entity17 ... " referring to @entity248 's decision to turn on the city 's heating system two weeks early this year due to colder temperatures , one of @entity17 's most popular fairy tale writers , @entity254 , posted : " @entity248 spent 800 million [ yuan ] to start the heating system 15 days ahead of time , but you 're out of the reach			1
hope the ' the @entity260 ' can forgive us in heaven			0
" the boys were @entity264 , 12 ; @entity265 , 11 ; @entity266 , 13 ; @entity267 , 12 ; and @entity268 , 9			2
