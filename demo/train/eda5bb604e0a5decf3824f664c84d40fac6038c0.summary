-- remember the name : @entity2			1
you may not have heard of him yet , but you soon will			2
since arriving at @entity5 nearly three years ago , the @entity4 has quickly become @entity7 's top jockey			1
it 's a long way from @entity9 , where the 27 - year - old struggled when he started his apprenticeship			1
" my first six months were really bad because i did n't have any experience , " @entity2 told @entity0			1
" ( my first trainer ) gave me a ride on a filly and i did n't really have control of her in the race			0
he said to me , ' @entity2 , you should look for another job because you do n't have the skill to be riding horses			1
' " that broke my heart			0
but i continued to work for him and when he saw i was n't going to leave he started giving me advice and really helped me			0
after that he started giving me more opportunities , including my first @entity31 winner			0
he was very important in my life and i will always appreciate that			0
" so what was the advice that his trainer gave him ? " riding horses is not that difficult , but riding horses in races is really difficult			0
not only do you have to have balance and skill , but you are riding against other jockeys , " @entity2 said			1
" you are trying to beat them , but how ? you must try to be the smartest one in the race			0
really know when to make your move			0
study the handicaps to see which horse is going to lead			0
" the advice certainly seems to have done the trick			0
@entity2 recently rode his 100th winner for the second consecutive season			1
but there is one prize in @entity7 racing that still eludes him : the @entity58			1
" i have n't had a winner in the @entity58 yet , so you could say it is my dream			0
the horse i 'm riding ( @entity64 ) has got a chance so i 'm just hoping			0
" what will be his strategy on sunday ? " my horse will probably be somewhere in the middle of the field or a little bit further behind , " he said			2
" i want to be as close as possible to the fence and give my horse every chance			0
the distance is quite long ( 2,200 meters ) so there 's time , but you do n't want to get caught wide at the first bend			1
" whether or not @entity2 captures his first @entity58 on sunday , it seems that the jockey already has one eye on his next career move			1
he is certainly not short of offers			0
@entity83 beckons -- he has already enjoyed success there this season and is a popular figure @entity87 , where he is nicknamed " @entity88			1
" @entity89 has also been floated as a possible next step			1
his fellow jockeys at @entity5 are full of praise for the charismatic @entity4			1
" this guy has got a bright future , " says veteran rider @entity93			2
" he 's young , talented and he 's gifted			2
@entity7 is a good first step for him			2
" @entity2 is keeping his options open : " nobody knows yet , not even myself ! "			2

@entity2 seeking to win @entity100 for the first time on sunday
@entity4 has become @entity7 's leading jockey in the past three years
he arrived after an inauspicious start to his career as an apprentice in @entity9
@entity2 is *mulling* over his future , considering moving to @entity83 or @entity89
