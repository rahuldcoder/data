-- it 's an illuminating idea which its creators hope will help drive up energy efficiency and bring down buildings ' carbon emissions			1
mixing the idea of @entity10 's @entity9 with multi-spectral thermal camera technology , @entity7 - based startup @entity6 is building a giant database mapping residential and commercial properties in the @entity14 the project is the idea of @entity17 , professor of mechanical engineering at @entity19 ( @entity19 ) who wanted to create a way of identifying and remedying inefficiencies in buildings			1
@entity6 currently has a fleet of five cars mounted with thermal cameras that take a matter of seconds to assess an individual building			1
the brighter the colors , the greater the " heat leak			0
" @entity32 ceo , @entity33 says they are capturing around two to three million buildings per month at the moment			1
" the purpose of the approach is to provide a snapshot of the energy efficiency			1
it answers about 20 - 30 % of the problems of your home			2
" i consider it a fabulous way to start a broader dialogue about the more comprehensive ( energy ) profile , " he added			2
@entity6 have also developed computer programs that generate energy reports highlighting specific areas of concern and calculating their cost -- financially and environmentally			1
the beauty of the reporting system ( see gallery ) is its simplicity , says @entity33 , with consumers immediately getting a sense of how efficient their homes really are			0
the database will also create what he calls " an eco-system around building efficiency " becoming the cornerstone of a competitive hub where homeowners can link up with specialists who can remedy problems			2
buildings consume around 40 % of the @entity14 's total energy requirements annually , according to the @entity75 , with over one third of that power going to waste			1
the company is evolving a business model which @entity33 hopes will mean customers wo n't pay a cent to view information about their home			0
instead , audits will potentially become part of the service provided by real estate databases like @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity33 says			0
@entity6 hope to have covered 10 % of the @entity14 's 125 million properties by the end of the year			1
thermal imaging surveys are nothing new , but widespread access to them is says @entity96 , ceo of @entity98 thermal imaging company , @entity97			1
" back in the 1980s the cameras cost about Â £ 250,000 ( $ 400,000 )			0
now they cost around Â £ 5,000 ( $ 8,000 )			0
so the technology 's moved on lots and lowered the barrier to entry for companies to go and do it			0
" @entity97 have surveyed around 200,000 @entity98 homes since they were founded in 2002 , and also offer customers quantified thermal images showing the financial and carbon costs of energy leaks			1
it 's a strategy that 's proved highly successful in motivating people to insulate their homes , @entity96 says			2
the @entity98 's @entity116 says online surveys and energy monitors can also help homeowners track their energy usage			2
they estimate that savings could save up to $ 380 a year by improving insulation			0
" the challenge is to do something about it , " says @entity124 , a energy consultant and former business development with the @entity116			0
" with gas and electricity prices only looking like they are going in one direction , the amount you can save is also upwards as well , " he added			0
" the headline figures around how much you can save could be the catalyst to get you from being aware to doing something about it			0

@entity14 startup hoping to improve energy efficiency by capturing thermal images of millions of homes
drive - by thermal imaging provides a snapshot of a building 's energy weak spots
@entity6 has imaged three million out of 125 million properties in the @entity14 so far
