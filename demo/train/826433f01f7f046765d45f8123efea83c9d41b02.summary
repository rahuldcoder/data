-- the declining dollar , surging oil prices , and exploding growth across the @entity4 are causing inflation levels to rise			1
@entity6 has already abandoned the dollar			2
and some analysts say the rest of the @entity10 may have to do the same to fight inflation			2
but do the @entity4 banks agree ? and how far do they think switching to a basket of currencies will bring down prices ? @entity17 and the @entity18 registered the highest inflation levels at 10 percent this week			1
in @entity21 , inflation was running at almost 4 per cent and 2.8 percent in @entity22			2
strong growth across the region , fueled by surges in oil prices have been a major factor			1
supply has been struggling to keep up with demand in the growing economy , causing bottlenecks in supply which drives inflation			2
@entity34 , cfo of @entity35 said the building boom in the @entity18 is another " primary cause " of inflation			1
rents are on the rise , causing other prices to climb			1
" if you consider that 36 percent of the inflation measure is made up of housing , you realize the inflation rate for the @entity18 is 10 percent and above simply because rents have been increasing above 10 percent per annum , " he told @entity0			1
but the other factor at play has been imported inflation via a weak @entity51 dollar			2
last week , in response to the sub-prime mortgage crisis , the @entity52 cut interest rates by 0.5 point to 4.75 percent in order to save the nation 's economy from a slow down			0
because currencies in the @entity10 region including @entity22 , the @entity18 , @entity17 , @entity64 and @entity21 are pegged to the dollar , their exchange rates also decline			1
this means prices of imports from non-dollar areas have increased , causing inflation			2
with currencies pegged to the dollar , banks in the region must also follow the @entity52 's lead with their interest rates			1
this is another driver for inflation because lower rates drive investment			0
but to soften the blow , @entity18 and @entity17 kept rate cuts to a minimum and @entity22 and @entity21 decided not to budge at all			1
rising prices are beginning to take their toll across the region			1
@entity84 is now one of the most expensive cities in the world			0
expats , with investments and bills to pay at home , are especially feeling the pinch of a weak exchange rate			0
as prices rise , the debate intensifies about whether countries in the @entity10 should review their dollar pegs and link instead to a basket of currencies			1
as analysts argue , when these countries first decided to peg to the dollar , oil prices were low and the @entity51 currency strong			1
today the opposite is true			0
fitting to a basket , they say , would better reflect the @entity10 's modern economic situation			0
@entity6 was the first country in the @entity10 to jump ship			0
in may it ditched the dinar 's peg and moved to a basket of currencies			0
but , as @entity34 told @entity0 , the @entity6 revaluation is yet to show an effect			0
" my understanding is that so far it has n't really shown any improvement in inflation			0
to the contrary , it suffers in the exact same way @entity17 and the @entity18 suffer			1
" @entity17 's central bank governor , @entity122 , told reporters and bankers last month that they were taking measures to control prices and rents to decrease inflation			1
but the dollar peg would remain , he said			0
@entity22 's refusal to cut interest rates with the @entity52 has prompted more speculation that it was preparing to break its dollar currency peg			1
but the @entity134 has continued to deny this			0
@entity22 bank , @entity136 , also " firmly " believes the @entity22 riyal will not be revalued			0
" an expected change in the currency regime will take place only if the dollar weakens at an alarming rate and is sustained over the medium term , " it said in a recent report			2
excessive speculation about devaluation , " could cause observers to overlook the @entity10 growth story , " said the report			0
" @entity153 's competitive advantage , in petrochemical exports for example , is not being affected , as most are priced in dollars			0
