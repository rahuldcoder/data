-- who inspired the @entity2 to throw a million bucks at @entity3 ? a country singing troubadour candidate who plays guitar , drives a minivan and makes a @entity9 tracker the star of his latest web ad			1
meet @entity13 , the @entity2 hopeful who 's trailing former @entity14 governor @entity14 in a four - way race that also includes former @entity9 senator @entity16 , running as an @entity18 and @entity17 , also an independent			1
the ad features @entity13 performing a modified version of the song " @entity24 , " which was originally written by @entity22 and later made popular by the band @entity23			1
the original song 's chorus " rock me momma like a wagon wheel " resonates well with both pop and country music fans			0
@entity13 , who has been turning popular music into campaign ads since the start of his campaign , was looking for a song that would connect more with millennials			1
" i was driving around one day and that song came on " @entity13 said			2
he then thought , " well , that 's gon na work			0
" when @entity13 first started making music videos into campaign ads , he admitted it that it takes a lot of courage			1
" we were a little concerned because no one had done it before , " he said , " but we figured , what the heck , let 's just keep coming up with good songs			2
it 's been a lot of fun			0
" @entity54 has also turned music into a family tradition , performing in a band with his two daughters , his brother and nephew called the " @entity61			0
" they perform regularly throughout @entity3 and even hold music festival events called " @entity64 , " which is an obvious take on the famous @entity66			2
@entity13 started combing music and politics in 1997 when he was a regional director for @entity69 under the @entity71 administration			2
" we actually wrote some great @entity69 songs , " he said while reflecting on his time traveling with his former @entity69 colleague and friend @entity73			0
with years of experience playing and traveling on the road , it 's safe to say @entity13 took this latest musical endeavor to a new level , modifying the lyrics to fit his campaign message			1
he plays the guitar while singing his own chorus , " so i 'm runnin ' for the @entity84 but i ai n't a big wheel , do n't have an army , just my automobile			2
" @entity13 might not be running a $ 9 million campaign like his @entity9 opponent @entity14 aims to raise , but he does have a new million - dollar bump to sing about			1
the @entity2 will spend $ 1 million on the race , mostly for television ads and to support field operations , @entity94 first reported			1
" the @entity2 obviously must think i can win , " he said			2
" after slugging on my own here for more than a year and half with very little money , i have n't spent all my time fundraising , i 've spent my money going to town to town and people are going to vote someone who has earned the privilege to represent them , not someone who is trying to buy their way in			0
" but it looks like the money wo n't help @entity13 produce another " @entity24 " style ad , with the funds expected to flood airwaves with attack ads hitting @entity9 nominee @entity14			1
that 's something groups have already done , with ads attacking @entity14 over his alleged involvement in a visa program scandal in the state			0
those types of ads will likely help @entity13 , but could also be a boon for @entity16 , the independent who surged into second place in a @entity130 poll released wednesday			2
@entity13 is now trailing both @entity14 and @entity16 by seven and four points , respectively , according to the poll			0
and the poll indicates @entity16 is mostly pulling votes away from @entity133			0
the investment in attack ads , rather than @entity137 ads suggests @entity138 are confident either a @entity13 or @entity16 victory will help them keep control of the @entity84			1
@entity94 reported that @entity138 are confident @entity16 , who endorsed @entity141 in 2008 and 2012 , would caucus with @entity138 if elected to the @entity84 , though @entity16 has not said who he would side with			0
it would n't be the first time this year @entity138 have pinned their hopes on an @entity18 candidate polling better than his @entity2 counterpart			0
in @entity149 , @entity138 pulled their nominee out of the race to bolster businessman @entity153 's bid to unseat @entity154 sen. @entity154			0
@entity153 also has not said who he would caucus with , though @entity9 have tried to paint him as " @entity141 's candidate for the @entity84			1
" @entity16 also wo n't get a chance to reproduce his style of advertising , one of which played up a popular @entity163 movie			0
@entity16 's campaign even bought air time during the @entity166 to play up the fact that he turned down a bribe in the @entity170 scandal depicted in the movie " @entity172			0
" as for @entity13 , he 's going to keep on campaigning on the ground , and keep on singing			1
he revealed he has one more campaign music video to release before the nov. 4 election			1
it 's going to be a modified @entity180 classic , but instead of " @entity181 " it 'll be called " @entity183 " and will go after one of @entity13 's campaign staples , getting big money out of politics			1
also , here is the @entity23 's version of " @entity24			2
