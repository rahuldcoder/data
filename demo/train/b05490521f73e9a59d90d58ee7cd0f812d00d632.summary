-- it 's an extraordinary claim -- one based on a 40 - year - old memory -- but one the @entity3 has been using in an attempt to untangle the unsolved case of skyjacker @entity6			1
to @entity9 of @entity10 , her uncle was @entity6 -- except she knew him as @entity11 she believes he died in 1999			1
" i saw my uncle plotting a scheme , " @entity6 told @entity0 's @entity12 of what she said she remembers witnessing as an eight - year - old girl four decades ago			1
@entity6 said she was with two uncles at her grandmother 's house around @entity20 time			1
" i was with them while they were plotting it			0
i did n't really know what was going on , " @entity6 said			1
" afterwards on @entity20 , i saw them return and i heard them discussing what they had done with my father			0
i have very vivid memories of it			0
" her claim might be cause for healthy speculation , especially 40 years after the fact , but two sources close to the investigation have told @entity0 that @entity9 's tip led to the @entity3 reviving the case and for the past year the agency has been actively working the lead			1
on november 24 , 1971 , a man calling himself @entity6 -- the " @entity6 " apparently was a myth created by the press , according to the @entity3 -- hijacked @entity46 and succeeded in getting authorities to give him $ 200,000 and parachutes in return for letting passengers off the plane			1
the man then asked to be flown to @entity53 but jumped out of the back of the plane somewhere between @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58 , @entity59			1
authorities have never been able to prove whether the man survived or what his actual identity was			0
@entity3 working new lead in @entity6 hijacking case @entity9 says he did survive , but maybe , just barely			1
" he and my other uncle came back very early on @entity20 morning and my @entity69 was wounded , " she said			0
" he had blood on his shirt			0
he was really in bad shape			0
" she said the @entity75 veteran later received treatment for his injuries at a @entity78			0
it was then @entity6 's father swore her to secrecy , she said			1
" he explained that what my uncles had done could mean death and he said , ' @entity9 , you can never speak of this , ' " according to @entity6 , who said she last saw @entity87 around christmas 1972			1
" he just vanished from the life that he had known before , " she said , noting that her uncle missed her grandmother 's funeral around 1975			0
the @entity3 has n't directly commented on @entity9 's claims , but a spokesman for the agency did say this week that the tip the agency is investigating came to them through a retired law enforcement officer , who had a contact who thought he or she knew the skyjacker 's identity but added the suspect was dead			1
@entity9 said she gave the @entity3 a guitar strap her uncle had given her mother			1
she said they could n't find any of his fingerprints on it			0
" family members of the deceased have cooperated with us and given us access to items which belonged to the deceased , " said @entity109 with the @entity3 's @entity110			1
the @entity3 's lab started looking for evidence that might prove the dead person was the man who skyjacked @entity6			1
the @entity3 wanted to retrieve items with fingerprints belonging to the new suspect			2
@entity109 said the @entity3 knows @entity6 had handled certain papers , including his plane ticket , and touched plane seats , but many fingerprints were found on those items			1
through the years , the @entity3 managed to identify some fingerprints but not all of them			2
@entity109 would not discuss the suspect 's identity , the evidence retrieved or what the lab results were			0
but , @entity109 said , " so far there 's not a lot that 's inconsistent " with the suspect matching @entity6			1
@entity109 added the @entity3 has not been able to prove the person is the mysterious skyjacker and the law enforcement agency still does not know for certain whether @entity6 survived his leap out of the plane almost four decades ago during bad weather			1
although the @entity3 has been looking into the new lead for a year , it was first revealed during an interview with @entity144 of @entity145 in advance of the 40th anniversary of the unsolved case this november			2
one clue came in 1980 , when a young boy found a rotting package full of $ 20 bills -- $ 5,800 in all -- that matched the serial numbers of the ransom money			2
the @entity3 returned most of the bills to the boy , named @entity157 , and @entity157 has since auctioned some of them , the @entity155 reported			2
" we 've run down thousands of leads and considered all sorts of scenarios , " the @entity3 said in 2007			2
" and amateur sleuths have put forward plenty of their own theories			0
yet the case remains unsolved			0
would we still like to get our man ? absolutely			0
" the @entity3 appealed for help from the public , releasing pictures of @entity6 's black @entity172 tie , which he removed before jumping and which later provided authorities with a dna sample , along with some of the found money			1
the agency reminded the public that @entity6 was no expert skydiver			2
" we originally thought @entity6 was an experienced jumper , perhaps even a paratrooper , " said special agent @entity178 in 2007			2
" we concluded after a few years this was simply not true			0
no experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch - black night , in the rain , with a 200 - mile - an - hour wind in his face , wearing loafers and a trench coat			0
it was simply too risky			0
he also missed that his reserve chute was only for training and had been sewn shut -- something a skilled skydiver would have checked			0
" agents also believe @entity6 had no help on the ground			2
if he had had an accomplice , he would have needed to coordinate closely with the flight crew and jump at just the right moment			0
" but @entity6 simply said , ' fly to @entity53 , ' and he had no idea where he was when he jumped , " authorities said			1
" there was also no visibility of the ground due to cloud cover at 5,000 feet			0
" two flight attendants who were in contact with @entity6 gave nearly identical descriptions of him , as did those who encountered him on the ground			2
he was said to be between 5 foot 10 and 6 feet tall , weighing 170 to 180 pounds with brown eyes			0
@entity178 said in 2007 he believed it was unlikely @entity6 survived the jump			2
" diving into the wilderness without a plan , without the right equipment , in such terrible conditions , he probably never even got his chute open , " he said			0
by the five - year anniversary of the hijacking , the @entity3 said it had considered more than 800 suspects and eliminated all but two dozen from consideration			2
several high - profile suspects have been ruled out over the years			0
@entity225 , who claimed on his deathbed to be @entity6 , was eliminated by dna testing , the @entity3 said			1
another man , @entity228 , did not match the physical description and was a skilled paratrooper			0
a third , @entity239 , who died in 1974 , also did not match the description and was at home the day after the hijacking having @entity20 dinner with his family in @entity235 -- " an unlikely scenario unless he had help , " the agency said			0
@entity109 said while the @entity3 understands there is great public interest in this long - unsolved case " it 's a fairly low - priority case for the @entity3 " as it pursues new investigations involving cases like missing children that have a current impact on public safety			1
even so , @entity109 said the @entity3 always follows up on any new tips on the case			2
on sunday , another @entity3 spokeswoman , @entity255 , told @entity0 the information on the new suspect is not expected to be " a big break in the investigation			1
" @entity0 's @entity12 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report			1

the woman 's claims are being investigated by the @entity3 , sources tell @entity0
a man calling himself @entity6 hijacked a plane in 1971
he jumped from the plane carrying a parachute and *pilfered* money
@entity6 has never been found and his fate is *unknown*
