@entity0 -- the plan to raise what would be the world 's tallest building in a dizzyingly fast time is in danger of not getting off the ground at all			1
according to reports in @entity11 state media , @entity10 , the developers for @entity13 , have so far failed to get the proper permits required to proceed with construction			1
the company put the first spade in the ground in the 202 - story project to much fanfare on july 20			0
developers hope it could be built within the year			0
the 838 - meter construction in @entity27 , the capital of @entity11 's central @entity25 province , would rise ten meters higher than the world 's current tallest building , the @entity30 in @entity31			1
" @entity10 is still currently in the beginning stages of arranging the construction project , " a @entity33 representative told @entity1			1
" so far , they 've undergone the process to obtain 136 mu [ 22 acres ] of land , but that 's it			0
they 're still in the very basic beginning stages			0
we 've been giving a lot of attention to this case , and everything they 've done has been according to law			0
" for its part @entity10 insisted everything was above board			2
" we have not yet started work on @entity27 's @entity13 , " a @entity10 press officer told @entity1			1
he added that they have evidence to show no laws have been broken			0
penalties for illegal construction vary widely across @entity11 between the countryside and cities , as well as between residential and commercial use			2
in @entity70 , the capital of @entity65 province , baseline fines for illegal construction range from 5 % to 10 % with investigative fees as much as doubling the amount			0
additional penalties for various infractions can then double the original fine , according to one official government website			0
in the southwest megacity of @entity79 , the fine for the illegal construction of a commercial building is 50 % of the cost of construction , according to another government site			0
if similar penalties exist in @entity27 as for @entity79 , @entity10 could be fined nearly $ 750 million			0
@entity13 's total construction cost is $ 1.46 billion			2
construction advocates have touted @entity13 's green credentials : it will save on energy and land use , creating an all - in - one home , office , shopping , farming and recreation environment for some 30,000 residents that no one ever needs to leave			1
critics -- including architectural experts and the @entity11 public -- worry about safety because of the use of non-traditional building techniques and the pace of construction			2
@entity10 pioneered the use of pre-fabricated steel - and - concrete blocks -- akin to @entity109 blocks -- that can be quickly hoisted into place			1
while the @entity30 took five years to build , @entity10 says this " fast - building technology " means it can construct @entity13 in just ten months			1
@entity13 will be completed in april 2014 , said @entity10 in earlier statements			1
however when questioned by @entity1 , the company 's press officer hesitated to provide a start date for construction			1
he added that plans will be announced at an as - yet unscheduled future press conference , leaving construction plans for @entity13 firmly frozen on the ground .			2

@entity11 state media reports @entity13 does not have required permits to start construction
@entity13 , developed by @entity10 , planned to be world 's tallest building at 838 meters
@entity10 to @entity1 : ' we have not yet started work '
@entity10 will use pre-fabricated steel - concrete blocks to build @entity13 by april 2014
