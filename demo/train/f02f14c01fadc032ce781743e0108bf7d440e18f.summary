-- thanks to a wave of new mobile technology , i can store my calendar , car keys , credit cards , music and notes all on my smartphone			0
that kind of convergence is convenient , but my phone has an @entity13			0
the battery does n't last forever			2
enter the @entity15 , a line of battery - equipped shoulder bags and backpacks made by @entity19			1
it 's a smart backup for when gadgets inevitably need to take naps			2
i tested the @entity15 messenger bag for about a month , and i also spent a brief time using the backpack , which is very similar			1
on several instances during my tests , the bag proved useful on long trips or when traveling to conferences where i 'm constantly making calls or doing e-mail			0
i had to overcome a couple of concerns before strapping on the @entity15			1
for one , the idea of carrying a battery about the size of a deck of cards on my back in the rain is not comforting			0
and this line in the @entity15 manual 's lengthy " warnings " section is not exactly reassuring : " improper use of this product may result in product damage , excess heat , toxic fumes , fire or explosion			1
" " @entity15 sources the highest quality cells and parts for the batteries , " a @entity54 spokesman wrote in a reply to my worried e-mail			1
" our batteries are all rigorously and thoroughly tested , enduring the most abusive of treatment , still upholding @entity15 's high standard of safety			1
" when i considered that i keep my phone in my pocket near vital organs , the fear seemed less rational			0
the battery is stored in a zippered pocket at the bottom of the bag			0
i would n't take the bag on a whitewater canoe trip or a daylong hike under the blistering @entity76 sun , but the rain did n't faze it			0
my other hangup involved the annoyance of having one more thing to keep charged			0
i already charge my smartphone , tablet , laptop , @entity84 , computer mouse and @entity87 headset			0
now i need to charge my shoulder bag , too ? however , i was pleasantly surprised by how long the @entity15 's battery lasts			1
it went for more than a week at a time retaining most of its charge			0
on a single charge , it can completely fill about two small gadgets -- a phone and @entity84 , for example			1
the bag includes three standard - size cords , including one that works with iphones and @entity84 , and another that charges @entity104 , @entity105 and many @entity107 phones			0
an @entity84 can be tucked into one zippered pocket while a @entity109 can go into another , each filling with juice simultaneously			0
the @entity15 is able to charge an @entity113 , which is nice because many alarm clocks tailored to ipods and @entity102 can not			1
but the tablet 's big battery sucks power more quickly , and it ca n't be fit securely anywhere for charging on the go			2
i was disappointed to learn that the @entity15 does n't provide an easy way to charge a laptop , which would have been useful for just a few more minutes of work on @entity124 at a coffee shop			1
a standard usb port is hidden in the battery pouch , so perhaps buying a usb - to - laptop charging cord would do the trick			2
an @entity131 spokesman said that including a two - or three - prong outlet would require the bag to have a cooling system , which is something the company is not eager to do			2
there 's a conspicuous button on the front of the bag for checking the battery 's charge status : up to four small lights , which can be hard to see in daylight			1
i kept the bag 's charger tucked in a pouch inside the bag			0
the cap and charging port located on the side of the bag snapped off a few days after i started testing it , and so from then on , i had to take the battery out and plug the cord in directly whenever i needed to refuel			0
the @entity131 spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models , like the one i tested , and that it 's been fixed for the bags sold in stores			1
the @entity15 costs about $ 140 , same as the backpack , and is sold at some big electronics and office supply stores , including @entity165 and @entity131 also produces bags with bigger batteries for about $ 40 more			1
there are several other travel bags on the market that have batteries inside , including ones that can be charged by sunlight using solar panels on the exterior			2
but most solar - powered bags look like an accessory that would have gotten a kid beat up in school			1
the @entity15 , designed by @entity180 , is stylish as well as useful , making it a good companion for gadgetheads who do n't want to advertise their geekiness .			2

we review @entity15 , a line of battery - equipped shoulder bags and backpacks
a full battery charge can fill up about two smartphones
unlike solar - powered bags , you can hardly tell it 's a geek accessory
@entity15 spokesman : the battery was rigorously tested for safety
