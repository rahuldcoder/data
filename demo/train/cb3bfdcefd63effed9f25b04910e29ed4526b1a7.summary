so , @entity0 apparently speaks @entity1			1
the @entity3 founder posted a video this week of himself participating in a 30 - minute question - and - answer session , mostly in @entity6 , at @entity8 's @entity7			1
and online writers -- especially the tech bloggers -- just freaking love this story			2
general reaction : like @entity13 ! @entity0 speaks another language ? ! " the crowd gasped and applauded as soon as he started speaking , and the good vibes appeared to last throughout the chat , " wrote @entity15 at @entity16			1
" out of nowhere , @entity0 now speaks @entity1 , " declared @entity20			1
" @entity0 just did a q&a			1
and slayed the crowd , " wrote @entity22 , editor in chief of the @entity24			2
the underlying assumption in all of this coverage is that it is insanely surprising that the kid genius ceo of a $ 204 billion company can maneuver in a @entity32 language			1
particularly a difficult one like @entity1 , which he speaks , according to @entity35 's @entity34 , " like an articulate 7 - year - old with a mouth full of marbles			1
" this should n't be surprising			2
@entity0 is a smart guy			1
he 's known to take on yearly self - improvement challenges ( 2010 , @entity1 ; 2011 , eat only animals he personally killed ; 2013 , meet someone new each day , according to @entity44 )			1
his wife , @entity0 , is @entity45 , and he said he 's been learning @entity1 partly to be able to better communicate with some of his in - laws			1
it 's home to the world 's largest population of internet users ( 632 million )			1
a little " charm offensive " could n't hurt			0
then just think about the situation in reverse : would anyone be shocked if the head of a foreign tech company -- try @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 or , in @entity6 , @entity63 -- showed up for a public speaking engagement in @entity65 and ( gasp ! ! ) spoke @entity32 ? of course not			1
we 'd eye - roll if they did n't			0
that 's because we @entity65 expect everyone to speak our language -- and rarely make the attempt to communicate in foreign tongues			1
only a quarter of @entity65 can hold a conversation in a second language , according to a 2001 @entity79 poll			0
compare that with about half of @entity82			0
and in @entity86 , while it 's tough to find comparative figures , it 's common to meet people who speak , two or three or five languages , since there are as many as 2,000 languages spoken on the continent			1
so perhaps @entity0 's somewhat passable second - language skills should n't be surprising , but they are			1
and i think a closer examination of why that 's the case reveals quite a bit about language and how it plays a role ( and does n't ) in modern @entity65			2
there are easy explanations for @entity65 's relative monolingualism			2
unlike @entity82 , where a long road trip can land you in another country with another official language , the @entity65 has historically been relatively isolated from other tongues			0
when immigrants bring foreign languages to our towns and cities , we generally have n't met them in the middle			0
we 've demanded they learn @entity32			0
@entity48 , when @entity32 speakers travel abroad , we tend to expect the world to cater to us			2
a couple years ago , i stayed at a @entity118 chain hotel in @entity119 , @entity120			0
the concierge gave me a business card that said something like , " i 'm lost , take me back to the hotel at this address " on it in @entity127			0
the idea was that i 'd hand the card to a taxi driver and he or she would zip me back to the safety of a hotel with @entity32 - speaking staff			0
like i was a lost puppy with a business - card collar			0
no need to learn a thing			0
these expectations help explain why @entity0 's @entity6 is both so surprising and so easy to poke fun at			1
his @entity1 presentation plays both into and against the stereotypes of the @entity142			1
we do n't expect anyone who grew up in the @entity65 -- especially those whose parents grew up in @entity65 , too -- to be able to speak a foreign language , or we do n't expect them to do it well			0
that makes it fun for writers such as @entity153 and @entity154 , at @entity155 , to say that the @entity3 ceo " showed a plucky disregard for the tones that @entity1 has -- one tonal slip - up had him saying that @entity3 boasts eleven mobile users instead of 1 billion -- and his enunciation was roughly on par with the clarity possible when someone 's stepping on your face			1
" but it also makes it easy to be impressed by @entity0			1
put me in the latter camp			0
@entity0 , who comes across , at times , in his verbal @entity32 communications as a semi-sophisticated robot , at best , is doing something language coaches will tell you is a must : he 's trying			1
he put himself out there in a big way -- he took a risk -- and that 's the only way he 'll be able to improve			2
and i think it 's representative of where we as @entity65 , in general , stand as language learners			2
but we should keep at it			0
we 'll have to in order to stay relevant -- both in global business and at home			0
there were 37 million @entity194 speakers in the @entity65 in 2013 -- up from only 10 million in 1980 , according to @entity195			0
some are bilingual , but some likely speak comfortably only in @entity194			0
i think there 's a fear in @entity32 - only @entity65 that everyone will have to learn @entity194 to function in certain parts of the country			2
we should expect that @entity32 will continue to be the linguistic glue of @entity65 -- that it will bind us together			0
but needing to learn @entity194 , and other languages , to better and more fully explore the country and globe should seem exciting , not threatening			0
learning a second language opens up new worlds , new neural pathways -- even new personalities			0
it 's something we all should embrace , a @entity211			2
but it 's far better than giving up .			2

@entity0 , @entity3 's ceo , shows off his @entity1 skills
@entity217 's @entity216 questions whether we should be so surprised
@entity0 is the ceo of an *enormous* internet company
@entity6 has the world 's largest population of @entity225 users
