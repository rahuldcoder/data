-- @entity1 has been killing civilians and international powers have failed to intervene			1
the @entity4 has killed people with drones and listened in on private communications in the name of national security			1
@entity10 has passed laws that target gays and lesbians			0
these are some of the trends in 2013 that @entity16 ( @entity16 ) cited in its annual account of human rights records around the world on tuesday			1
in a 667 - page report , the @entity21 - based group highlighted key human rights issues in more than 90 countries , drawing on events through november			1
@entity16 executive director @entity26 presented the account , the 24th of its kind , at a press conference in @entity31			2
below are some of the issues in focus			0
@entity1 @entity16 deplored international powers for failing in their responsibility to protect civilians in @entity1 after almost three years of civil war that has claimed more than 100,000 lives			1
a day before international negotiations begin in @entity43 , the group contrasted the handling of the conflict with the reaction of the international community in other countries such as @entity49 and @entity50			2
it said " the unchecked slaughter of civilians in @entity1 elicited global horror and outrage but not enough to convince world leaders to exert the pressure needed to stop it			1
" it accused @entity10 and @entity58 of using their vetoes at the @entity62 @entity61 to shield the government of @entity1 president @entity64 from strong international action , such as an arms embargo or referral to the @entity68			1
" despite a swiftly rising death toll and horrific abuses , @entity10 and @entity58 neutered the @entity61 and enabled the killing of @entity1 civilians by both sides , " @entity26 said in a statement			1
" as the @entity77 peace talks begin , with uncertain prospects of success , they should n't become the latest excuse to avoid action to protect @entity1 civilians			1
this requires real pressure to stop the killing and allow the delivery of the humanitarian aid they need to survive			0
" a team of internationally renowned war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts has found " direct evidence " of " systematic torture and killing " by @entity64 's regime , the lawyers on the team have said in a new report			2
@entity97 the @entity16 report also highlighted alleged abuses in struggling democracies , calling @entity97 the " most glaring " example of " abusive majoritarianism			1
" the report criticized the government of the country 's first democratically elected president , @entity105 , which it said ruled " in a manner that left secular and minority groups fearing exclusion in an @entity111 - dominated government "			2
in the wake of @entity105 's military - backed ouster in july , the interim government of @entity113 had launched what @entity16 said was the " worst repression that @entity97 has known in decades , including by killing hundreds of @entity119 protesters			2
" " for the second time since the fall of ( former leader @entity123 ) @entity123 in february 2011 , a government is in power with little apparent inclination to limit itself by respecting basic rights , " @entity16 said			0
authorities have cracked down on the @entity119 since @entity105 's ouster , rounding up the movement 's leaders and making membership illegal			0
@entity97 passes a new constitution @entity4 president @entity134 's record on national security issues came under fire from @entity16 -- from the continued existence of the detention center in @entity139 to what the group called the unlawful killing of civilians through drone attacks in countries such as @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148			1
another major topic concerned the revelations of " virtually unchecked mass electronic surveillance " by the @entity4 made public by fugitive and former @entity154 contractor @entity152			0
while @entity16 credited @entity134 for appointing a panel to recommend reforms , it questioned " whether any of these recommendations will be acted on			1
" in a speech on friday , @entity134 unveiled new guidance for gathering intelligence as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation 's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and civil liberties			1
@entity16 expressed concern other governments , including those will a poor rights record , could follow the @entity4 example in surveillance , forcing " user data to stay within their own borders , setting up the potential for increased internet censorship			2
" in addition , the group chided @entity181 for attempting to prosecute @entity152 under the @entity182 , noting that this had allowed @entity10 , which has offered @entity152 temporary sanctuary , to " recast itself as a champion of privacy rights			0
" what @entity134 changed at the @entity154 @entity10 @entity16 highlighted " homophobic rhetoric , including by officials , and rising homophobic violence " in @entity10 , which last year passed a law that bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it			1
the legislation , which president @entity197 signed in june , gives authorities the power to impose fines as well as detain and deport foreigners who are deemed to have breached the law			0
@entity197 says gays ' can feel safe ' at the games " vigilante groups , consisting of radical nationalists , and neo-nazis , lure men or boys to meetings , accuse them of being gay , humiliate and beat them , and post videos of the proceedings on social media , " @entity16 said in the report			2
" a few investigations were launched , but have not yet resulted in effective prosecution			0
" authorities in @entity10 , which will host the @entity219 in @entity220 next month , have also continued the crackdown on civil society and government critics that began in 2012 , it said			0
enforcement of the " foreign agents " law in 2013 led to an unprecedented , nationwide inspection campaign of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations and court cases , it said			0
@entity16 dismissed @entity197 's decision late last year to free jailed activists from the punk band @entity234 and environmental group @entity235 , as well as @entity237 critic @entity236 as attempts to avoid international criticism ahead of the @entity219			1
" the effect was largely to highlight the arbitrariness " of mr. @entity197 's government , the report said			0
@entity58 while it announced the abolition of " the abusive administrative detention system @entity251 , relaxation of the one - child policy , and plans to improve the delivery of justice , ( @entity58 's new leadership ) has yet to embark on fundamental reforms that adequately respond to the public 's increased demands for justice and accountability , " @entity16 said			2
the group said it was particularly concerned about the arrests of activists who have campaigned for officials to publicly disclose their assets despite the government 's declared crackdown on graft			0
other areas of concern include a government campaign to stifle online rumors , and repressive policies in the restive ethnic minority regions of @entity272 and @entity273 , it said			0
@entity16 said international pressure on @entity58 over its human rights situation was " inconsistent " last year , saying that some countries , such as @entity277 and @entity278 , had toned down criticism in summits with the @entity58 leadership			1
" @entity58 is home to more than a billion people and is a major global power , so how the rest of the world addresses its human rights situation is more vital than ever , " @entity283 director @entity282 said in a statement			0
@entity58 has consistently defended its human rights record and lambasted foreign groups which criticize it .			0
