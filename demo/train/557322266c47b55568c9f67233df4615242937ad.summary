@entity1 's parliament voted prime minister @entity2 out of office on tuesday after months of political infighting that has crippled the @entity6 country			1
the vote of no - confidence came after rebels in eastern @entity1 said a tanker loaded with oil from a port under their control escaped a naval blockade and moved into international waters			1
the @entity1 government said late on monday that it had taken control of the @entity19 - flagged tanker , @entity20 , as it tried to leave the @entity12 in eastern @entity1 , and after having briefly exchanged fire with rebels			1
however , in a sign of the chaos and conflicting information typical for @entity1 , the rebels rejected the assertion			1
oil production , @entity1 's economic lifeline , has slowed to a trickle since the summer as armed protesters have seized oil ports and fields to press political and financial demands			1
they are seeking a greater share of the country 's oil revenue , as well as autonomy for eastern @entity1			1
the conflict over oil wealth is stoking fears @entity1 may slide deeper into chaos as the fragile government fails to rein in the armed brigades that helped oust @entity43 in 2011 but now do as they please			1
the removal of @entity2 , a liberal weakened for months by infighting with @entity47 , deepens the turmoil in the country of 6 million people			1
however , a crowd outside the @entity55 hotel where lawmakers had met to vote could be seen cheering as news broke of his dismissal , images broadcast on @entity1 television showed			2
" we have nothing personal against @entity2 , but his government has failed the people , " one man said			0
defense minister interim premier @entity2 will be replaced temporarily by defense minister @entity66 , who will hold the position of premier for two weeks until a replacement is picked			1
he was sworn in after the vote			2
@entity1 state news agency @entity71 said the @entity72 had passed the dismissal with 124 votes ; it was not immediately clear how many of the nearly 200 lawmakers were present during the session			1
previous attempts to bring down @entity2 , who has headed the government since november 2012 , had failed to win the required majority			0
@entity2 was himself briefly abducted by former rebel militia in the heart of the capital @entity55 last year			0
he had for months been facing rising opposition from @entity47 parties and the wider public , blaming his government for the rising violence in the vast desert nation			2
corruption and a multitude of other problems @entity1 is facing in its bumpy transition			2
at the same time , anger has been mounting against the @entity72 after it extended its term in office , which was supposed to end on february 7			0
angry protesters earlier this month stormed the @entity72 headquarters -- ransacking it , assaulting some members and wounding two others while shooting			0
" @entity106 demonstrations have taken place since early february against the continued tenure of the @entity72 , " the @entity102 ' special envoy to @entity1 , @entity103 , told the @entity104 on monday			1
" strong resentment and animosity has grown between the two main , though not homogeneous , camps			0
@entity1 faces the risk of embarking on a new trajectory of unprecedented violence			1
" slumping oil output @entity55 had entrusted militia leader @entity117 to safeguard some crucial oil ports			0
but eight months ago , he and his men seized them , blocked oil exports , and demanded more autonomy and shared revenue for his eastern region			0
the blockades have led to a slump in crude production -- with output said to be around 250,000 barrels per day , down from 1.6 million			0
@entity1 's government has threatened force against ships that entered the rebel - controlled oil ports on several occasions			2
but despite ultimatums to such ships , those deadlines came and went with no action from @entity1 officials			2
in this case , @entity2 's government had threatened armed action , even an air strike , to prevent the @entity20 tanker getting away with the oil bought from the rebels ' self - declared autonomous regional government without the authorization of the state oil body , the @entity151			0
it is unclear who actually owns the vessel			0
speaking as @entity66 was sworn in , @entity72 president @entity158 told lawmakers : " this period is definitely hard , but we will work together and provide all we can based on our experience ... we wish him all the luck			0
