-- the first weekend of this year 's @entity1 was blessed by gorgeous sunny weather -- until a sandstorm swept through the desert sunday night			1
the swirling dust clouds prompted @entity7 frontman @entity6 to quip , " i feel like @entity9			2
... i 'm going to go home and throw up a sandbox for my small child			2
" one of his band mates -- it was hard to see which through the haze -- added , " i feel like @entity18 during the @entity19			0
" the @entity7 , who were headlining @entity21 for the third time , soldiered through cuts from their current album , " i 'm with you , " mixed with hits like " @entity27 , " " @entity26 " and " @entity28			1
" an enthusiastic crowd sang along , their voices slightly muffled by the scarves and pieces of clothing they 'd pulled over their noses and mouths			0
a few resourceful concertgoers even managed to get their hands on surgical masks			0
ironically , the weather conditions seemed to benefit electronic artist @entity42 , who goes by the moniker @entity42			0
performing in the adjacent @entity45 , his show featured a dazzling display of lasers and lights , whose brilliant hues were enhanced by the dusty backdrop			0
the most coveted souvenirs from sunday night were @entity54 beachballs			0
the legendary rap icons kicked it old - school , tossing out oversized black - and - yellow inflatables stamped with the group 's trademark " w. " in the crowd , three blonde girls tussled over one beachball , while a man nearby hugged his tightly against a chainlink fence , trying to deflate it before a shirtless guy in an @entity70 headdress could snatch it from him			2
it was a scene straight out of @entity73 with a soundtrack provided by one of the greatest rap groups of all time			0
the dust has n't even settled on this year 's @entity21 -- or in this case , been swept away -- but festival goers were already speculating who might appear on the 2014 bill			1
@entity83 ran high when this year 's line - up failed to include the @entity85 , especially after a @entity21 date briefly appeared on the @entity85 ' website in december then mysteriously disappeared			1
there was speculation that the @entity7 were a last - minute fill - in -- a point the band not - so - subtly referenced during its sunday night set , when it played a snippet of the @entity96 's " @entity95			1
" one act you probably wo n't be seeing at @entity21 anytime soon -- the @entity99			1
even though the band 's guitarist , @entity101 , played three @entity99 songs during his solo set on friday , he tells @entity0 it is n't true that festival organizers are constantly throwing big bucks at him and @entity108 to reunite on stage			1
" no , " he says with a hint of steel in his soft speaking voice			0
" it 's just kind of my nature to move forward			2

a sandstorm *whipped* through the last day of @entity21
@entity7 closed out the festival , playing their hits and " @entity95 " by the @entity85
the @entity99 guitarist @entity101 says there 's no reunion with @entity108 in the works
