@entity0 -- the @entity2 offered only vague information in its first criminal filing in federal court about how deep accused fence - jumper @entity6 entered the @entity8 , in contrast to the dramatic account of the intruder 's dash through the building that was revealed by lawmakers monday			1
in a sworn affidavit filed with the court on the night of the incident , @entity2 officer @entity15 offered details based on his " personal observations " of @entity6 's sprint inside the @entity8			1
in his account , @entity15 described how he " yelled " at @entity6 to stop			1
" instead , @entity6 ran toward the @entity8 , " @entity15 continued			2
the officer then suggested that @entity6 was subdued shortly after making his way through the @entity26 doors of the @entity8			2
" moments later , @entity6 went through the north doors of the @entity8 and entered the @entity8			2
soon thereafter , inside the @entity8 , @entity6 was apprehended by @entity29 , " @entity15 said in the affidavit			1
as it turned out , @entity6 made it much farther into the @entity8 than the court filing described			0
the intruder was stopped in the @entity35 of the building , a law enforcement official told @entity1 monday			0
@entity6 appeared in a @entity0 federal court wednesday and pleaded not guilty on charges of unlawful entry while armed and two other charges			0
on the night of the incident , @entity2 spokesman @entity41 told @entity44 officers apprehended @entity6 " just inside the @entity26 doors			1
" at a hearing of the @entity48 tuesday , chairman @entity46 grilled @entity2 director @entity49 on the accuracy of the affidavit on just how far @entity6 penetrated the @entity8			1
" the federal complaint said he was -- he was in fact apprehended in one place			0
is n't it true he was apprehended further into the @entity8 , " @entity46 asked			0
once it was apparent @entity58 was not directly answering the question , @entity46 interjected			0
" in fact , the federal complaint and the earlier reports were not accurate , is that correct ? yes or no , please , " @entity46 asked			1
" i think the original complaint is accurate that mr. @entity6 scaled the fence , " @entity58 responded			1
@entity46 cut her off again			0
" i want to know if we can rely on reports from your agency , " @entity46 complained			1
a federal law enforcement official told @entity1 the information provided to reporters on the night of the intrusion was based on what was told to @entity2 spokesmen at that time			1
but the whereabouts of the fence - jumper 's capture was not the only discrepancy that night			2
rep. @entity81 , @entity82 pressed @entity58 on statements to the media that indicated @entity6 was unarmed			0
on the night of the incident , @entity41 , the @entity2 spokesman , had told reporters @entity6 was not carrying a weapon			1
but @entity15 's affidavit from september 19 states @entity6 " carried a deadly or dangerous weapon , " described as a @entity91 black folding knife with a three and a half inch serrated blade			2
" why would the @entity2 put out an official press release saying that , " @entity81 asked about the agency 's failure to disclose the knife found on @entity6			1
" did you call them back and say you got that wrong , " @entity81 continued			0
" i have no knowledge of that , " @entity58 replied			0
" did you read the press release before it went out ? " @entity81 asked			0
" i have read the press release before it went out , " @entity58 answered			0
@entity105 , a former @entity2 agent and @entity106 who is running for @entity107 in @entity108 , said affidavits from agency officers are sometimes intentionally vague			1
" why give up free information " to defense attorneys , @entity105 said			0
but @entity105 said @entity58 's handling of the @entity6 case is indicative of the " small , insular group of managers " in charge of the agency			2
during @entity58 's testimony tuesday , lawmakers noted her 30 years of service to the embattled agency			1
@entity105 said @entity58 's long tenure and promotion to director are more a reflection of what he described as the agency 's practice of promoting from within			2
" it 's a reflection , sadly , of the cabal , " @entity105 said .			0

@entity2 provided vague details of fence jumping incident in *initial* affidavit
lawmakers are questioning whether @entity2 provided full account of what *happened*
issa to @entity2 chief : " i want to know if we can rely on reports from your agency "
