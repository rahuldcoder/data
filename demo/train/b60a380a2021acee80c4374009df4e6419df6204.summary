-- for the last decade , @entity1 has been helping children stay connected to their incarcerated parents through video messages			1
@entity1 was honored as a @entity5 in 2008 , and has since expanded her @entity6 to prisons in five states			1
her story inspired actress @entity10 , who recently joined @entity11 on a visit to a maximum security prison			1
@entity0 's @entity14 spoke with @entity10 about her experience			1
@entity14 : what was it about @entity1 's efforts that first sparked your interest ? @entity10 : i learned about a subset of the population that i never thought of before , which are the children of incarcerated parents			1
there was something about how hard of a sell it is ; anytime you are talking about inmates or people in prison , people automatically -- there 's some pushback			1
but with @entity1 's brand of philanthropy , i just found myself intrigued , and i had to help her out			1
read the 2008 story : ex-con 's videos keep inmates , kids in touch @entity14 : how does the @entity6 work ? @entity10 : the @entity6 goes into prisons across the country and films messages of incarcerated parents who are either reading a book , a bedtime story , giving a very positive message , giving love to the caregiver watching these children			1
something so simple you would think would n't be a big deal , but to a child who 's lost their parent to incarceration , they watch these videos over and over again			1
it has a really positive effect on them			1
so many times , a lot of these children end up in prisons themselves , and this is something that might be able to stop that chain			1
i think about watching my father 's video			2
my father 's been deceased for many years			2
when he was at my wedding , he just said , " i love you			2
" i watch it over and over and over again , and it just lifts me up			2
to these children , these are not hardened criminals			2
oftentimes they are just looked at as @entity82 or @entity83			2
so , it 's very important that the children know it 's not their fault and that they know they 're loved			2
more : @entity5 @entity14 : how did you get involved with the program ? @entity10 : i met @entity1 in 2008 and we 've been trying to get together			1
... the @entity6 is now in @entity92 , in @entity93 , in @entity94			2
and we kept talking about @entity95			2
it 's the most incarcerated state in the country			2
and that 's where i live			0
so i said , " we 've got to get in there			0
" and we finally made it in			0
it ... was a lot of pressure ; i wanted it to go well			0
@entity14 : what did that day involve ? @entity10 : it involved me driving for hours and hours and hours to the middle of the desert , to the middle of nowhere @entity95			1
... it involved meeting five inmates who , most of them , may never come out of that prison			1
and they really did n't strike me as people who had done anything except that they were dads in that moment and they wanted to get messages to their children			0
@entity14 : what 's it like seeing someone who is incarcerated and you know why they are there , and yet you see them in kind of a different light when they are trying to get a message to their child ? @entity10 : apparently these are hardened criminals , people who are doing time for very , very serious offenses , often murder and armed robbery			1
i personally did n't want to know until i left what they did			0
i just wanted to appeal to them as a mom and as a parent			0
i think we do n't think about the impact of what the children of incarcerated parents have to go through			1
sometimes their parents are just yanked , right in front of their eyes in some very difficult situations with policemen and guns			1
so , it 's a mind - boggling situation for children , and these tiny messages are so impactful			0
@entity14 : it 's an incredibly intimate act , the making of these videos			0
@entity10 : even being there and watching some of these men , i was moved to tears because i saw how gut - wrenching it was for them to say , " i 'm sorry			1
this is not your fault			0
@entity83 loves you and i just want you to be the best person you can be			0
" those little anecdotal things sound very @entity171 ©			0
we take it for granted if we 've got a parent in the home , but hearing that for a child can make all the difference in the world			0
i felt like i was doing something not necessarily for the inmates , but for their children			0
i was impacted by it for the rest of the day , and still am			0
@entity14 : you were recognized by a couple of the prisoners			0
what was that like ? @entity10 : we walked into the cell block , and ... two gentlemen that came out looked at me			1
one of them said , " hey , @entity10			1
what 's going on ? remember you met me in @entity195 , and it was 1980			0
you were shooting ' @entity197			0
' " he said , " i 've been trying to get a script to your agent			0
" ... ( laughs ) even in jail somebody has a script for you , @entity204			0
... i was just very blown away at his resourcefulness , because sure enough , three days later my agent said , " did you meet a screenwriter in jail ? " @entity14 : what is it about the @entity5 project that really caught your interest ? @entity10 : i 'm a @entity5 groupie			1
... the heroes just use whatever it is that is at their disposal , and i 'm always blown away by what they are able to accomplish with so little			0
and for no other reason than it is their calling , it is something they are drawn to .			0
