@entity3 has said he would work to reduce carbon emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by 2050			2
he has said he would commit $ 2 billion annually for 15 years to advance clean coal technology			2
he also has pledged to oppose a windfall profits tax on oil companies that , according to his campaign web site , " will ultimately result in increasing our dependence on foreign oil and hinder investment in domestic exploration			0
" @entity3 also believes the @entity18 needs to deploy smartmeter technologies , which collect real - time data on the electricity use of individual homes and businesses			2
meanwhile , @entity2 laid out his comprehensive energy plan monday in @entity37 , @entity38			1
" if i am president , i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single , overarching goal -- in 10 years , we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire @entity50 and @entity51 , " the presumptive @entity48 nominee told a crowd			1

effort by five @entity48 and five @entity14 to break @entity97 ' energy impasse would allow expanded offshore oil exploration and embrace ambitious energy efficiency and efforts to develop alternative fuels			1

would provide for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and give host states or localities a proprietary interest so when advanced recycling technologies turn used fuel into a valuable commodity , the public would share in the economic benefits			0
@entity2 : says he 'll find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste			2
in @entity48 debate earlier this year , he said , " we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix. " renewable energy @entity3 : would commit $ 2 billion annually to advance clean coal technologies			2
calls for a permanent tax credit , which he says will " simplify the tax code , reward activity in the @entity18 , and make us more competitive with other countries , " according to his campaign web site			0
encourages development of low - carbon fuels -- wind , hydro and solar power			0
@entity2 : would require 10 percent of @entity18 energy come from renewable sources by the end of his first presidential term			1
the plan would extend the production tax credit for five years to encourage the production of renewable energy			2
create five first - of - a - kind , coal - fired demonstration plants that would capture and store carbon dioxide emissions and invest in technology that will allow for more coal use			0

it is a market - based approach that would set caps on carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions and provide industries with tradable credits			0
