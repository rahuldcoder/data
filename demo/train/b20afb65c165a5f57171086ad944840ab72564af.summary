@entity0 -- a brewing @entity4 storm will pour desperately needed rain on @entity7 's historic drought , but the pending wet wallop promises to carry a high price as schools in @entity11 and @entity12 are bracing themselves and will be closed thursday , officials said wednesday			1
the rainfall is expected to be so significant that meteorologists call its source an " atmospheric river			1
" many people in @entity7 were bringing lawn items inside			1
" i 'm just trying to bring some stuff down that might blow away			2
we are not taking down the @entity29 decorations though , leaving those up unless it gets real bad , " @entity25 of @entity26 said			2
@entity25 , who owns a comic book store , said he and his family had a " handful of sandbags " because their residential complex tends to flood even with a little rain			1
already , the fingertips of the storm were ravaging the coast of @entity42 , eroding a beachline and threatening homes , according to a @entity1 affiliate @entity45 reporter 's tweets			2
the fire - hose weather system will slam into the @entity50 by thursday , forecasts say			1
atmospheric rivers are 250 to 400 miles wide and split off like a tributary from a much larger band of moisture from the tropics			1
they only come occasionally but are necessary to fill up water reservoirs , the @entity56 says			2
" up to 50 % of annual precipitation on the @entity50 occurs in just a few ar events			1
" on the weather map , the storm looks like a cloud river in the sky flowing straight at the coast , and in combination with the storm system chasing it ashore , it is expected to dump 2 - 5 inches of rain in many places this week			1
the highest elevations of @entity7 might get 10 inches of rain , forecasters said			1
@entity11 could see 2 to 4 inches in the city with up to 8 inches in the hills			1
schools shuttered the @entity11 and @entity77 officials blamed their planned closures on the potential downpour			1
" closing schools is a serious decision , " said @entity81 superintendent @entity80 in a statement , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity83			1
" i did not arrive at this lightly			2
first and foremost , we do n't want to risk having our students injured or seriously delayed transporting to and from school			2
in addition to student absences , the storm could result in large numbers of staff absences , which could then lead to inadequate supervision of our students			2
furthermore , power outages could affect the district 's ability to feed students ' school meals , among many other operational challenges			2
" in a message to students and staff on the district 's @entity107 page , @entity12 school officials cited " an extreme and potentially dangerous weather system " as the reason for the closings			1
" we recognize this decision will interrupt the normal routine and require some families to seek other child - care alternatives and we apologize in advance for the inconvenience			1
we do , however , feel it 's our responsibility , given the dire reports from the @entity56 , that we take this precaution and steps to maximize student and staff safety			2
" @entity124 might get 1 to 2 inches with twice as much in the hilly areas			0
that much rain may be more common , if you live along the @entity129 or @entity130 , but for parched @entity7 , which researchers at the @entity132 say is the most drought - stricken state in the country , it 's a lot to handle at once			1
and in many areas , it comes on top of high rains last week			0
the weather service warned there could be moderate river flooding in @entity7 and @entity42			1
folks in @entity144 were expecting high winds thursday , but in @entity147 , 80 miles northwest of @entity148 , it was already blustery on wednesday			1
" i was waiting for trees just to go blowing right by the beach , " @entity149 told @entity1 affiliate @entity150			0
" it was really , really windy			0
and the waves were probably ... 15 feet high coming in			0
the swells are coming in really , really fast			0
" about 115 miles down the coast in @entity158 , it was n't as bad at @entity159			1
" right now it 's probably 4 - to 5 - foot ( surf )			1
it 's picking up for sure , " employee @entity162 said			0
and the wind ? " a tiny bit			0
" flooding possible in the @entity167 on tuesday , public works crews got ready for a downpour			0
a road crew vacuumed mud and trash out of a storm drain , @entity1 affiliate @entity169 reported			0
" this is not the most glamorous work that there is , even with equipment like this			0
this is still really hard work			0
hard and dirty work but something that has to be done to make sure the system functions properly when we do have a big storm , " @entity180 spokesman @entity179 told @entity169			0
the sheriff 's department in @entity188 , which has a lot of waterfront land , is handing out sandbags to residents			1
@entity167 power crews cut pine tree limbs hanging over power lines ahead of winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts up to 70 mph			0
those howling winds will also drive in high surf up and down the @entity50 , with some breakers rising 20 feet high			1
they are expected to push up water levels in @entity42 's @entity203 , which could have residents of @entity205 and @entity206 wading through shoreline puddles			0
the area will live up to its reputation for sogginess , as about half a foot of rain is expected to fall between early wednesday and late thursday , the weather service predicts			1
nor'easter the wet maker on in the @entity216 looks more like a circular water sprinkler , spinning in moisture from the @entity219 , where it is clashing with cold air			2
the nor'easter 's wet , cold misery -- from chilly rain to snow and ice -- have slushed the @entity216 and will continue to as the gyrator drifts north through northern @entity228			0
@entity229 , @entity230 , expected more snow on thursday			2
the 6 - 10 inches of snow in @entity233 , @entity234 , on wednesday will get a glazing of freezing rain more than once this week , the @entity56 predicts			2
winds will be high there , too , with gusts of 40 to 60 mph			0
they could cause coastal flooding in @entity234			0
real rainmaker there were reports of record rain on tuesday from the @entity230 metropolitan area with nearly 3 inches falling			0
at @entity247 , 2.95 inches fell , the most on this date			0
at @entity251 , where 2.65 inches fell , the flight delays at one point reached four hours			0
according to the flight tracking website @entity253 , more than 2,600 flights departing from and / or landing in the @entity256 were delayed tuesday and 1,200 were canceled			0
@entity1 's @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this report .			0
