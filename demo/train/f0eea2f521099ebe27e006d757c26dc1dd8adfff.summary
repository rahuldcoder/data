during the world championships in @entity2 last month , sprint king @entity0 was asked how long he intended to keep running			1
he kept reporters guessing and some thought he would n't last until the next @entity5			2
but on wednesday @entity0 said that he would call it quits after racing at the 2016 @entity7 in @entity8			2
" so far it 's after the @entity5 in @entity13 , " the 27 - year - old told reporters in @entity11 , where he is competing friday			1
" if i 'm in great shape and i go there and do what i have to do , i think it would be a good time to retire on top and having dominated for so long			0
" the @entity20 admitted he struggled with his motivation this year and it is little wonder given he has regularly coasted to 100 - and 200 - meter victories at the @entity5 and world championships			1
" i could n't find that goal , that drive to get going again , " @entity0 said			2
" i sat down and thought to myself -- what do i really want ? and what can i do in this sport some more ? " including relays , @entity0 owns a combined 14 gold medals in the sport 's two biggest events and is the world record - holder in both the 100 and 200 meters			1
in order to ensure his place in the pantheon of sporting legends , @entity0 said he needs to go out on a high in @entity13 -- and hopes his powerful body cooperates			1
" i 've made up my mind that if i want to be among the greats of @entity45 , @entity46 and all these guys i have to continue dominating until i retire , " he added			0
" i 'm really focusing on getting every season correct , trying not to get injured and just continue dominating so at the end of my career people will put me among the greats			0
" his accomplishments to date already make him one of the best athletes of all time			0
not the shy type , @entity0 called himself a " legend " after achieving another individual sprint double at the @entity56			1
no one came close to challenging him in @entity59			0
his only misstep since rising to the top took place at the 2011 world championships in @entity64 when he false started and was disqualified from the 100 - meter final			1
and in a sport hit hard recently by positive drug tests to sprinters @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 -- the latter two are fellow @entity20 -- @entity0 has never tested positive , always maintaining that he is clean			2
with a personality larger than his 6 - foot - 5 - inch frame , @entity0 is especially popular among fans and sponsors alike			0
@entity77 this year named him the 40th highest - paid athlete in the world with earnings of $ 24.2 million			0
he features in commercials for @entity82 and is also backed by @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , among others .			0
