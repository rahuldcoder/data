it will be the first time a @entity3 has been sold by a living recipient			1

" he was the first person i met who i could really talk to , " @entity0 said in 2013			0
" i 'd met people , but they did n't share my conviction that only @entity2 was important			0
" in 1953 , the pair came to the conclusion that @entity2 was formed by two twisted strands of molecules , like the rungs of a ladder , holding the iconic double helix structure together			1
" all we could say when we got it : it 's so beautiful ! " @entity0 said			0
' @entity2 was my only gold rush , ' says @entity0 the discovery , which explained how @entity2 stores information and how it is replicated , changed biology forever and revolutionized medicine			2
" everything we do since then is more or less based on that structure , " @entity55 , professor of genetics and human biology at the @entity58 and a former graduate student of @entity0 's , said last year			0
announcing the sale , @entity11 's auction house said @entity0 's work was " on a par with @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , ( and his ) unyielding quest for knowledge led to discoveries that forever altered human history			2
" the lucrative allure of the double helix @entity0 says he intends to use part of the money raised by the sale to fund projects at the universities and scientific research institutions he has worked at throughout his career			2
" i look forward to making further philanthropic gifts to @entity85 , the @entity86 , and @entity87 , " he said in a statement			0
he added that the auction would mean he could " continue to do my part in keeping the academic world an environment where great ideas and decency prevail			0
" last year , @entity21 's " @entity98 " letter to his son , in which he explained the structure of dna weeks before the discovery was officially announced in the april 1953 edition of the journal nature , was sold for $ 6.06 million			1
the world record price -- more than three times its pre-sale estimate -- made it the most expensive letter ever sold at auction			0
