beach volleyball players , particularly olympians , are known all around the world for their incredible skill with the ball			1
they 've also been known for wearing those skimpy uniforms			2
now , something that 's covering their skin is getting a lot of attention			0
it 's called kinesio tape			1
the tape has been around for decades , but during the @entity13 , it has been spotted stretching and spiraling in interesting patterns on some athletes			1
@entity17 silver medalist @entity16 had big black pieces snaking up his legs in the decathlon			0
@entity22 beach volleyball star @entity21 wore bright blue bits of it running up and down her six - pack abs. even ping - pong players were reportedly wearing it			0
with its @entity30 popularity , athletic trainers say you can bet you will see a lot more of the tape at your local gym or on the playing field this year			1
@entity36 , a @entity37 athletic trainer who is on the board of the @entity39 , says he received a call friday from a patient about the tape			1
" she said she had been watching the @entity30 , saw the tape on sale , and wondered if she should buy it , " he says			1
" i definitely think i 'll be getting a lot more of these calls for the next month or two			0
" the highs and lows of the @entity13 ' crying games ' @entity36 says he keeps the tape as a tool to help improve balance in athletes , and says it helps prevent excessive protraction injuries -- in layman 's terms , shoulder problems from activities including playing tennis			1
if you put the soft and stretchy cotton tape in the right area , @entity36 says , it will pull at your skin when you start to overextend your arm , reminding you not to			1
because the tape is thin and pliable , it 's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists , he says			1
that kind of tape keeps the injured joint from bending to prevent further injury			1
@entity79 chiropractor and acupuncturist @entity78 designed the taping method in 1979 , according to his company , @entity82			0
he thought the standard taping methods of the time were too restrictive and may even extend injuries , because they inhibited the flow of inflammatory fluids beneath the skin			1
a flexible tape that could be applied to injured muscles , he believed , would stimulate circulation through its tug on skin and start clearing out the damage			1
according to @entity96 , education director for @entity97 , @entity78 's patients kept telling him they felt great in his office , but the impact of his healing hands would diminish after a while			0
the tape he developed stretched the good feeling			1
" i was just at the @entity30 beach volleyball game between @entity105 and @entity106 with him , and both of the teams were covered in it , " @entity96 said			0
" you should have seen the doctor 's smile			0
to think he just had an idea and created a product that serves practitioners and is used at the highest level of athletic competition in the world , well , you know why he was smiling			0
" the company has trained more than 100,000 practitioners around the world on how to use the tape , @entity96 says			2
it has been used by 80 countries at the @entity128 , he says			0
it also has been spotted at the usually staid @entity130 and on athletes including soccer 's @entity132 and cycling 's @entity134			1
" a lot of athletes like it because there are no chemicals and it is a natural healing mechanism that tells different receptors to deactivate a little bit if the muscle gets too tight , " @entity96 says			2
some , however , are skeptical about the tape 's effects			1
there are n't many large scientific studies regarding its effectiveness , says dr. @entity151 , an assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at @entity153			2
" i think , if anything , there is a placebo effect involved , and there probably is a little bit of a peer pressure effect			0
when people see athletes who are doing so well , they think , ' maybe this could work for me , ' " he says			2
why do @entity163 bite their medals ? he compared the tape to knee braces for athletes			1
" there is little data to support knee braces ' effectiveness in a lot of situations , but when i talk to my patients , they say they do n't want to run without it , " he says			2
@entity176 , an @entity177 runner who is also a massage therapist for athletes , says he 's a fan of the tape			1
" it definitely feels like it is doing something , and helped me feel better in training , " @entity176 says			0
he has used it for his own plantar fasciitis			0
with his clients , he uses it for shin splints and he has taped up some hamstrings			0
@entity176 says he has n't used the tape in any races yet			2
" but hey , i 'm a runner -- we 'll try anything that will give us that edge			0
" running coach and marathoner @entity195 says she tried the tape , but it did n't work for her			2
" i have hamstring issues and i kept trying it , but the stuff just would n't stick to me , " she says			0
" ultimately , i decided to go the regular therapy route instead , but i know some people swear by the stuff			0
" still , says @entity151 , " if it gives you a sense of stability and support , or gives you that psychological edge , why not ? it 's not going to harm them			0
it 's pretty - colored cotton tape			2
