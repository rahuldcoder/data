-- just a minute ago i was sailing down a @entity3 highway , level as a tabletop			1
then i dropped off the face of the @entity7 into the heart of a wild place called @entity10			2
it 's the rough - and - tumble centerpiece of a 15,000 - acre state park , 100 miles southeast of @entity13			1
@entity10 is about 100 miles southeast of @entity13			2
if you hanker to break away from the herd , you ought to see it in the quiet of an early morning when shades of red and yellow streak canyon walls like melted sunshine and you can hear the haunting bellow of bison bulls grazing in the grass			1
off the beaten path hidden in the midst of sprawling ranches , @entity10 does n't lure as many visitors as its famous neighbor , @entity29 ( 93 miles northwest )			1
that 's the way @entity31 , caretaker for the official @entity3 bison herd , likes it			1
it means you can still find quiet times to catch a vision of the land not greatly changed from the way it was when millions of bison roamed the @entity7 and wintered in hidden canyons			0
when you look at these mighty creatures in the state herd , you 're seeing the direct descendants of wild bison once " as numerous as grains on the seashore , " according to one traveler 's report			1
@entity52 : wide open in @entity3 you can see the bison from viewing platforms and through telescopes at an overlook near the new visitors center , but @entity31 keeps them separated from people for safety			1
" you do n't push bison , " he says			0
" you work them on their own terms			0
i still consider them wild animals			0
" @entity52 : climbing in @entity3 hit the trail there are many ways to explore the scenic canyon -- hiking , mountain biking , on horseback , or by car on a 5 - mile loop			1
even on the drive , you get a close - up look at multicolored sandstone cliffs and rugged arroyos carved by tributaries of the @entity83			0
the long narrow @entity84 stands as high as 1,000 feet in places			0
so did roving @entity89 bands and prehistoric canyon dwellers as long as 12,000 years ago			0
@entity91 , owner of @entity92 ( [ 806 ] 269 - 1209 or [ 806 ] 455 - 1208 ; rides start at $ 35 per hour ) in the nearby town of @entity95 ( pronounced " kitty - quay " ) follows in the footsteps of explorers when he takes riders out to sections of the 64 - mile - long path , which is part of @entity10 & @entity102			1
@entity52 : 40 things i love about @entity3 you do n't need to be experienced to ride , but if it 's your first time you should start with an hour - long trip			2
try to schedule it for early morning			0
" that 's when we see most of the wildlife , " @entity91 points out			0
whether you explore it from the saddle or behind a steering wheel , it 's a piece of untamed @entity3 you wo n't see anywhere else			2
