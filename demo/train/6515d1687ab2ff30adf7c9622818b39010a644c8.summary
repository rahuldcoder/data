@entity0 -- depending on who is talking , the @entity3 movement is either an extremist force dividing @entity6 or a group of disgruntled taxpayers setting the government on a proper course			1
the conservative political force has shaken up this year 's congressional elections , backing candidates who defeated @entity6 incumbents and other mainstream @entity6 candidates in primaries across the country			2
@entity20 , chief strategist for the @entity20 -- the most organized and visible of the movement 's factions -- told the @entity23 program " @entity24 " that his group is a political action committee comprising members limited to donations of up to $ 5,000 with no corporate contributions allowed			1
" we 're the purest form of democracy , i think , in the @entity3 movement , in the sense that when we want to do something , we do n't have any money to start with , we have to send an e-mail out to our people and say , ' hey , we think @entity39 is going to be a great candidate in @entity41 , and do you want to get behind her ? ' " @entity29 said sunday			1
the end result , he said , would be the election of candidates " willing to stand up for more responsible fiscal policy in @entity0			2
" " we 've turned the political system on its head , " @entity29 said			1
" and what 's done that is that millions of @entity51 , who , many of them , had been sitting out the political process , have gotten involved in the campaigns			2
" however , @entity57 sen. @entity56 , the second - ranking @entity58 in the chamber , told @entity1 's " @entity65 " program that candidates such as @entity62 showed the negative impact of the @entity3 movement on the political right			1
@entity6 primary victories by @entity3 - backed nominees over mainstream contenders such as @entity70 sen. @entity69 and nine - term @entity72 rep. @entity71 end up giving @entity74 contenders a chance to win previously out - of - reach races in november , he said			1
" when the @entity3 becomes the gatekeeper of a @entity6 primary , we end up with contests we never dreamed of , " @entity56 said			1
" who would have guessed that today we would be taking an honest look at @entity70 , @entity72 , and @entity82 , where we clearly have races where the @entity74 can win ? " @entity56 also cited @entity83 , where @entity6 @entity86 's @entity85 candidacy with @entity3 support caused gov. @entity88 to wage an independent campaign , throwing the race into what @entity56 called " turmoil			1
" " i think that shows the @entity3 position is too extreme for most voters , and i think we 're going to do well in those states , " @entity56 said			1
" people have to ask themselves , is this what we really want in the @entity85 ? " @entity86 , interviewed on the @entity23 program , said he and the @entity3 movement reflected the " sentiment in mainstream @entity51 that @entity0 is broken			1
" " we do n't want to change @entity51 , " he said in reference to president @entity105 's 2008 campaign theme and agenda			2
" we want to fix things that are wrong in @entity51			0
" he advocated bedrock conservative positions , including a balanced budget amendment to the @entity110 , banning congressional earmarks and imposing term limits on @entity114 members			0
however , his stance was more moderate on an issue important to the crucial senior citizen population in @entity83 -- reforming @entity118 to ensure its future solvency			0
@entity86 said benefits for current retirees or those close to retirement should remain fixed , and the system must survive for the younger and future generations without bankrupting the country			0
" we 're going to have to accept there are going to be some changes , " he said , mentioning a possible future increase in the retirement age for eligibility			0
also on the program , another @entity3 - backed nominee -- @entity135 @entity6 @entity85 candidate @entity134 -- expressed similar conservative credentials			1
" i see myself as part of a group of candidates who have been elected in this country because of frustration with what 's happening in @entity0 , " @entity134 said			2
" we 're going there not to be part of the establishment , not to be part of what we consider the problem in @entity0 , but to get there and to reduce spending , to promote ideas like a balanced - budget amendment and term limits and ideas that have been talked about for a while , " he said			0
the @entity3 - backed candidates interviewed sunday made no mention of the " @entity158 " document released last week by @entity160 as a proposal for how they would govern if in power			1
@entity74 criticized the economic - focused program that includes reduced spending , lower taxes and other bedrock @entity6 positions as a rehash of failed past policies			1
in an editorial saturday , the @entity171 called the document " a bid to co-opt the @entity3 by a @entity6 leadership that wants to sound insurrectionist but is the same old @entity0 elite			2
" " not only are the players the same , the policies are the same , " the editorial said			0
" just more tax cuts for the rich and more deficit spending			0
we find it hard to believe that even the most disaffected voters will be taken in			0
" conservative rep. @entity181 of @entity182 told the @entity184 program " @entity185 " that the " @entity158 " represented a return to @entity6 roots			0
" republicans did n't just lose our majority in 2006 , we lost our way , " @entity181 said			0
" we walked away from the principles of fiscal discipline and reform that minted our governing majority back in 1980 and again in 1994			0
and the @entity51 people walked away from us			0
" conceding that the proposals in the document are " not necessarily new , " @entity181 said it represented a commitment to " important first steps in this @entity114 to steer our national government back to " basic principles and practices .			0
