-- he has one eye , a thick beard streaked with henna and has lost a finger			0
he wears thick aviator - style dark glasses			0
at least we think so			0
there are very few photographs of 40 - something @entity11			1
but to counterterrorism officials on three continents , he is one of the most dangerous men in the world			0
@entity11 is a veteran jihadist who in his early years fought the @entity18 in the disputed territory of @entity20 and the @entity21 in @entity22 -- which is where he lost his eye			1
he famously escaped from an @entity18 jail and then fought with a unit of @entity28 's special forces			2
ten years ago , @entity18 troops carried out a raid into @entity28 - controlled @entity20			0
@entity28 officials said 14 civilians , including several children , were slaughtered			0
the next day , @entity11 led a retaliatory raid			1
he and his fighters kidnapped and beheaded an @entity18 army officer -- and later paraded his head through the bazaars of @entity28 - controlled @entity20			0
but then , @entity11 fell out with his sponsors in the @entity28 military			1
at one point , he was arrested in connection with an attempt to assassinate @entity28 's president , gen. @entity44 , in 2003			0
for reasons unknown , @entity11 was released a short time later			1
and that was where the trouble really started , when a local jihadist went viral , moving his base of operations from @entity28 @entity20 to @entity52			0
as commander of " @entity54 , " part of @entity56 ( movement for an @entity57 ) , @entity11 formed a close relationship with @entity59 in the wild frontier territory of @entity28			1
@entity62 's no. 1 enemy is still @entity18			0
his group was thought responsible for the bombing of a bakery popular with foreigners in @entity67 in 2009			0
but there is plenty of evidence that he has ambitions beyond @entity72			0
@entity73 , the @entity74 citizen who confessed to helping scout targets for the @entity77 attack in november 2008 , said after his arrest that he had twice met @entity11			1
during questioning by @entity18 's @entity79 , which was given access to him in @entity82 , @entity83 , in june , @entity73 said he 'd been taken to @entity28 's tribal territories to meet @entity11 early in 2009			1
a copy of the interrogation obtained by @entity0 reveals that @entity11 sent @entity73 on another trip to survey targets in @entity18			1
one place he said he videotaped was the bakery that was later attacked in @entity67			0
he also said @entity11 had encouraged him to attack the offices of the @entity94 newspaper that published cartoons of the @entity96			1
according to the indictment of @entity73 , @entity11 told him he could " provide manpower , weaponry and funding for the @entity94 operations			1
" @entity73 says @entity11 gave him $ 1,500 and told him to " concentrate on the @entity94 attack at the earliest			1
" @entity73 travelled to @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity94 to refine his plans , before being arrested at @entity82 's @entity107 in october 2009 as he tried to leave for @entity28			0
in a plea deal this year , @entity73 confessed to his involvement in both the @entity77 and @entity94 plots			2
now intelligence sources on both sides of the @entity113 believe @entity11 is trying to get teams into @entity115 that would launch coordinated @entity77 - style attacks in several cities			1
in those attacks , gunmen raided several buildings , including hotels , simultaneously , leaving 164 people dead			0
the @entity124 home secretary , @entity123 , said last week that police were receiving special training to handle such an attack			0
in a rare interview with @entity129 last year , @entity11 boasted of those plans			2
the newspaper 's @entity132 reporter , @entity131 , says he was taken to a secret location in @entity52 in october 2009 for the interview			0
@entity11 apparently wanted to use the occasion to refute claims that he 'd been killed in a drone strike near the town of @entity139 the previous month			2
@entity131 describes meeting a tall , well - built man with a firm handshake			0
he asked him whether the world could expect more " @entity77 - style " attacks			2
" that was nothing compared to what has already been planned for the future , " @entity11 replied			2
@entity115 intelligence officials are now anxious that " the future " may be imminent , with @entity59 looking to use people with @entity151 passports in attacks -- @entity115 and @entity154 , for example			2
there are plenty of foreign fighters in @entity28 's tribal regions -- as many as 10,000 , according to a @entity28 military commander			0
one of those fighters , @entity162 , was detained in @entity163 , @entity22 , last july and interrogated by @entity74 forces at the @entity165			2
according to @entity115 counterterrorism sources , @entity162 said he had met @entity11 , though there is no confirmation that he did			1
another man alleged to have sought out @entity11 is @entity82 taxi driver @entity170 , who travelled to @entity28 in 2008 and 2009			2
he was arrested this year in the @entity74 and charged with attempting to provide support to @entity59			1
court documents say @entity170 met @entity11 , who had told him that he " wanted to train operatives to conduct attacks in the @entity74			1
" the documents include a conversation @entity170 is alleged to have had with an unidentified conspirator about @entity11 's relationship with @entity59 leader @entity179			1
@entity170 told the unidentified conspirator that @entity179 gives orders to @entity62 , and then @entity11 transmits the orders to the mujahedeen			2
@entity170 has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him			0
intelligence officials say that besides being an experienced operator , @entity11 has also managed to navigate the often perilous waters of jihadist rivalries , attracting members of other @entity28 groups to his " @entity191 " and retaining a measure of autonomy despite pledging allegiance to @entity59			1
that 's probably in part because of his operational prowess			0
if @entity179 is @entity59 's " spiritual " leader and @entity200 cleric @entity199 its philosopher , @entity11 is the organization 's military brain			1
as one @entity74 official puts it , @entity11 is " the key ingredient in the bad stew of senior terrorists who are planning operations in the region and beyond			1

few photographs exist of @entity11
he 's forged a close relationship with @entity59
a @entity74 citizen who helped scout targets for the @entity77 bombings met with @entity11
