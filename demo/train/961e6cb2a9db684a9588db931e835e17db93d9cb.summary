@entity0 -- democrats aiming to keep the @entity3 are facing tough odds in next week 's election with their chances depending on convincing a surge of women and african - americans to vote			1
both sets of voters will be vital in two of the crucial races — in @entity14 and @entity15 — which new @entity1 polls show are headed for photo - finishes with only three days of campaigning left			0
@entity19 are especially bullish in @entity15 , where their candidate , @entity21 war veteran @entity20 , leads @entity22 by 49 % to 47 % for a @entity3 seat @entity2 have held for nearly 30 years			1
@entity22 leads among women voters by 12 points in the @entity1 / @entity27 survey — but @entity20 does three points better than that among men and also dominates the potentially decisive bloc of rural voters			2
in @entity14 , home of the most expensive midterm race in history , sen. @entity33 leads by two points and enjoys a slim gender gap			0
her advantage comes after she spent much of this election cycle slamming @entity19 foe @entity41 over his attitude to equal pay legislation			2
the @entity19 has a solid grip on the @entity46 but @entity19 need a net gain of six seats to grab the @entity3 for the first time in nearly a decade			1
they 're expected to easily win @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 to bring them to the cusp of victory on tuesday			2
other battlegrounds are in @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , making the outcome of the election too close to call			2
and @entity19 have to watch a few seats of their own			0
democrat @entity66 is surprisingly strong in @entity67 and @entity68 sen. @entity68 is struggling to put away an independent challenger in @entity70			0
election day might be tuesday , but more 14.8 million @entity72 have voted already , casting early , absentee and mailed - in ballots , according to dr. @entity75 of the @entity76			1
both parties are claiming the early edge			0
in @entity14 , for instance , 48 percent of the more than 870,000 early voters were @entity2 , a potentially significant boost for @entity33			1
@entity83 spokesman @entity82 said the party is encouraged because it is seeing early voting from people who did n't show up in the last midterm elections in 2010			0
that election was disastrous for democrats when the @entity84 wave helped @entity19 take control of the @entity46			1
but in @entity15 , a state where @entity2 usually have the edge in early voting , @entity20 is tied in early returns			1
and in another danger sign for @entity2 , @entity19 @entity94 is up 10 points in @entity61			1
@entity98 spokeswoman @entity97 said that the @entity19 's predictive analysis shows @entity2 are behind in early voting			1
" we have changed our strategy and are turning out more voters who normally would n't vote in midterm elections and are turning them out earlier than we ever have before , " she said			0
early voting is especially crucial for the @entity2 , because their base voters are historically less prone to show up in midterm elections			2
a heavy early turnout for the party could help offset expected enthusiasm among @entity19 on @entity109			2
setting the stage for a frantic final weekend of campaigning for an election that will set the stage for the early skirmishes of the 2016 presidential campaign , top party surrogates were out in force			0
@entity118 is blitzing states where president @entity121 , with his tattered political brand , would not be effective and was hitting the trail for @entity33 on friday			2
@entity121 did , however , get off a few blows in friendly territory in @entity125 on friday , saying that @entity19 backed policies towards women and politicians that belonged in a " @entity131 " episode			1
on the @entity19 side , @entity133 gov. @entity132 is visiting three states -- @entity58 , @entity70 and @entity136 and @entity137 was at a lunch in @entity139 with embattled @entity19 gov. @entity140			0
as both parties focus on turnout , the discussion in the competitive @entity3 contest is turning to race			1
@entity2 sen. @entity145 angered @entity19 by suggesting to @entity146 that @entity121 has a tough time in the @entity50 because the region has not " always been the friendliest place for african - americans			1
" @entity59 gov. @entity151 , a @entity19 , blasted @entity145 's comment as " remarkably divisive " and said @entity121 was unpopular because of his policies			1
" she appears to be living in a different century , " he said in a statement			0
" trying to blame it on race is ridiculous			0
" @entity145 later repeated her line in a statement that also attributed @entity121 's unpopularity in @entity59 to energy policies , including a moratorium on offshore oil drilling			1
" in addition , the south has not always been the friendliest or easiest place for @entity72 to advance , and it 's been a difficult place for women to be recognized as the leaders we are , " she said			2
" everyone knows this is the truth , and i will continue to speak the truth even as some would twist my words seeking political advantage			0
" and as the midterm season winds down , potential 2016 presidential contenders are getting a taste of what life might be like on the campaign trail if they decide to seek the @entity46			0
@entity182 was repeatedly heckled thursday in @entity183 by activists backing a path to citizenship for young , undocumented immigrants			0
" i am a strong supporter of immigration reform , " the former secretary of state shouted over the rowdy rally .			0

tuesday 's election could determine @entity3 control
turnout will be *key* if @entity2 want to maintain their *majority*
@entity121 appealed to women during a trip to @entity200
