-- a word to the wise			1
if you 're going to go walking in snow , take big steps			2
i was knee deep in a @entity8 forest pretending to be the adventurer @entity9 when i came a cropper and collapsed face first into a snowdrift			2
before i could emerge from my embarrassing predicament , a photograph was helpfully plastered across social media			2
i held out a hand for help , but @entity19 , a giant of a cameraman , was too busy laughing			2
this place eats up @entity25 virgins and spits them out faster than you can say ceo			1
veterans like @entity30 , who is attending his 10th @entity22 , take great pleasure in warning new @entity0 producers that it 'll cost a fortune , it 's exhausting , but it 's like no other event like it you 've ever been to before			1
imagine taking a small @entity8 city , laden with shops selling little more than overpriced cuckoo clocks , chocolate and snowboards , surrounding it in barriers of steel and snipers , and inviting the masters of the universe in business , politics and academia to visit			2
@entity55 's highest city is a very strange place			2
it 's where $ 20 wo n't even get you a portion of pasta , where your pidgin @entity61 and @entity64 is quietly laughed at , and where any kind of shoes feel like a bad choice			2
@entity69 once said : " there 's no such thing as bad weather , only the wrong kind of clothing			0
" in @entity25 , everyone 's changing clothes every time they move from ferocious air blowers indoors to the @entity81 outdoors			1
i saw one ceo quickly dump his $ 400 brogues in favor of some slightly ridiculous moon boots			0
hunters are stylish and do rather well			0
my $ 7 discount store rubber attachments have -- so far -- survived intact			0
beyond the ring of steel , tourists were rapidly banished as journalists from round the world take over ski lodges and budget hotels			0
small businesses clear off as corporate hospitality moves in			1
over a weekend i watched a pet shop converted into a plush hospitality suite for @entity98			1
the @entity100 lounge looked like no other bank i 've ever been to			0
if only my local branch in south @entity103 was kitted out with comfy sofas and a bar			0
it would be somewhere to drown your sorrows when you 've smashed through your overdraft			0
inside the barrier , once you 've passed armed security , the x-ray machine and the id card scanner , you 're finally allowed entry to the @entity115 ( clearly a typographical error ) using the back entrance though a tunnel made from material not unlike a bouncy castle			0
it 's brilliant white , and resembles a bio-hazard emergency tent which featured in @entity123 30 years ago			0
sweating in heavy winter gear under the power of hot air blowers , i soon discovered how my @entity112 badge dictates your right to access , food and hospitality at @entity22			1
simply put it 's a reinvention of the class system			0
journalist purple badge holders are ranked just above pond life , but at least we can get inside the center			1
white badges are allowed better nibbles			0
meanwhile , back in the forest , i struggled to tie a washing line between two trees			0
i then added some @entity25 related surveys with clothes pegs			1
this was a stunt for my show , @entity55 , which showed the plethora of reports which come out to coincide with @entity22			1
the phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " sprung to mind more than once in the freezing wind , followed by another whispered piece of advice from @entity30 which i had cheerfully ignored : " do n't forget the long johns , @entity158			1
" opinion : will global elite listen to @entity161 of poor ? can @entity25 make a difference to global inequality ?			1

@entity158 , a " @entity25 virgin " shares his experience of attending the @entity22 for the first time
he is told it *'d* cost a fortune and would be exhausting , but also that @entity171 is nothing like any other event
he discovers how the color of his @entity112 badge dictates his right to access , food and hospitality
