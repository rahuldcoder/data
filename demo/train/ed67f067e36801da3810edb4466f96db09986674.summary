@entity0 , @entity1 -- the final runoff of @entity5 's first free elections in recent memory has ended and the result is clear : @entity9 parties have swept the popular vote			1
should the international community worry ? in every @entity13 country where popular uprisings have pushed dictators out of power , @entity9 parties have become the most powerful political force			1
that has caused anxiety among progressive @entity13 and a great deal of confusion in the @entity22			1
after all , the uprisings that were optimistically labeled the " @entity23 " were supposed to herald a blossoming of freedom , democracy and equality			2
do @entity9 parties believe in freedom , democracy and equality ? if you ask them , you will hear a symphony of reassurances and contradictions , punctuated by an occasionally jarring declaration , as when @entity5 's @entity35 proclaimed that " democracy is heresy			1
" if there were a surprise in @entity5 's parliamentary elections , it was the strong showing of the @entity42 , who would like to turn the social clock back by several centuries and return to the rules that governed @entity48 lands in the days of the @entity49 , about 1300 years ago			1
the @entity50 have proposed banning women and @entity52 from holding office , ending alcohol sales and cutting off the hands of thieves			2
they call @entity52 and @entity58 " infidels			2
" the other electoral surprise , in @entity5 and elsewhere in the @entity13 world , is just how badly liberal groups -- the ones who launched the uprisings and embrace the kind of democracy we would recognize in the @entity22 -- fared at the polls			1
the @entity70 of the @entity71 came on top in @entity5 's latest election , taking about 40 % of the vote			1
the @entity42 came in second with about 25 %			0
this means that @entity9 parties captured a whopping two - thirds of the vote			1
the winners will form @entity5 's first democratically - elected parliament , which will choose the people who write the country 's new constitution			1
the @entity42 ' extreme views have helped the @entity71 look moderate , which is exactly the image they want to project to the @entity22			0
leaders of parties affiliated with or inspired by @entity5 's @entity71 who have won elections in @entity91 and even in @entity92 , where @entity93 allowed elections to prevent an uprising , say they support democratic principles			1
when speaking to the @entity98 media , they have especially tried to send out a reassuring message			0
but occasionally they have slipped up			0
in fact , the @entity71 is still trying to sort out where it stands on many issues			1
a case in point is the peace treaty with @entity107			0
the group has said it has no intention of revoking the treaty			0
but a few days ago , the deputy leader of the @entity71 , @entity111 , told the newspaper @entity112 that the @entity71 would never recognize @entity107 , is not committed to the peace treaty and would take steps to change it			0
at the moment , liberal @entity5 activists are more focused on how to wrest power from the military			1
but , assuming that battle succeeds , their attention will turn to what an @entity9 government would mean			1
both the @entity42 and the @entity71 acknowledge plans to impose @entity124 , the traditional @entity125 law			1
the difference is that @entity42 want to do it immediately			0
the @entity71 , which has learned patience during decades of operating underground , says it will bring it back gradually , over many years			0
it was n't very long ago the @entity71 declared it would not allow a @entity52 to become president			0
about 10 % of @entity5 are coptic christians , who have endured brutal attacks since the uprising that ended the dictatorship of @entity135			1
but the @entity71 has been steadily toning down its rhetoric			0
throughout the region , the long - time leaders of @entity9 organizations , which had been banned by regimes often supported by the @entity140 and its @entity142 allies , are emerging as powerful politicians trying to convince the rest of the world to trust them			1
countries like @entity5 , @entity91 and @entity92 , all need @entity98 tourists and their hard currency			1
the last thing they want is to spook investors and worsen their already dire economies			0
in the @entity22 , some are convinced that this turn of events spells disaster			0
they do n't believe the @entity125 ' claims to moderation and think they are biding their time and will eventually show their true , radical colors			2
after all , the @entity71 has deep extremist roots			0
one of the major figures in the organization 's history , @entity167 , had a passionate hatred of the @entity140 and the @entity22			2
his views on the @entity58 fed the worst anti-semitic conspiracy theories among his followers			0
it 's hard to imagine all of this has suddenly evaporated			0
and yet , the @entity71 also has a strong pragmatic streak			0
while it is true that it provided the ideological fuel for @entity178 and for the @entity179 and @entity180 -- the group that assassinated @entity5 president @entity181 as punishment for making peace with @entity107 -- it is also true that these terrorist groups emerged after the @entity71 renounced violence			2
so , what do @entity125 really hope to accomplish ? @entity187 does n't need to wait for an answer to that question before it starts responding to this uncertain situation			2
in fact , it can already start helping to shape the future of the @entity13 world by strongly promoting the ideals it supports			1
the @entity5 people have not studied democracy the way @entity140 or @entity142 have			1
president @entity200 and his counterparts in other liberal democracies should help explain the @entity22 's vision of democratic principles and tolerance			2
they should talk about how democracy does not just mean majority rule ; it also means protection of minorities , equality for women and for people of all religions			0
it means rule of law and an independent judiciary			0
the @entity22 should make clear that those leaders who help preserve peace and build that vision of society in the emerging @entity13 democracies will have its support while those who do n't will not have its backing			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0

some of the @entity125 are still trying to sort out where they stand on many issues
