-- when you visit the doctor , chances are you are given a prescription for a drug or an order for an x-ray or lab test			0
before you leave , it 's important to ask whether your doctor 's recommendations are truly necessary			2
even though much of what physicians do is meant to help patients , sometimes it 's not always the case			2
drugs may have harmful side effects and tests have the potential for adverse complications			2
unnecessary tests and medications contribute significantly to our country 's spiraling health costs			1
it 's estimated that $ 700 billion of our $ 2 trillion annual health spending falls under the category of wasteful medicine			1
consider the common sinus infection , which brings 16 million @entity32 into the doctor 's office each year			0
unfortunately , most of these cases have a viral cause , so antibiotics wo n't help the patient			0
despite that , antibiotics are still prescribed in 80 % of cases			0
sinus infections alone equal $ 5.8 billion in health care costs each year			1
or , take the example of prostate cancer screening on a certain demographic			0
the @entity47 , an independent panel of nongovernment clinicians who provide evidence - based practice guidelines , recommends against screening men over age 75 for prostate cancer			0
studies have shown that the benefit of prostate cancer screening is uncertain and further tempered by the complications from treatment , which can include impotence and urinary incontinence			0
however , a december 2011 study from the @entity61 reveals that more than half of men over 75 continue to undergo prostate cancer screenings			0
this past week , the @entity65 along with nine professional physician groups released a list of 45 common tests and procedures that are performed too often			1
the list includes electrocardiograms for asymptomatic patients , imaging tests for routine back pain , and pap smears for women younger than 21 years old			1
along with the recommendations to cut down on these procedures , an education campaign called choosing wisely was launched with the goal to start the important conversation between doctors and patients about the necessity , or lack thereof , of these commonly ordered tests			1
but implementing these guidelines into everyday practice may not be easy			1
most doctors do n't have the time to go into detailed discussions about all the options on the table			1
if i try to explain to my elderly male patients why prostate cancer screening does n't always help , or inform young adults that antibiotics are n't necessary for most sinus infections , it would take much more time than the 15 minutes that i can give for a routine office visit			2
in many cases , it 's quicker to simply order a test or prescribe a drug , which takes seconds , rather than go into the pros and cons of a treatment path			0
the medical community needs to come up with strong incentives to encourage doctors to spend more time educating their patients about the harms of over-testing , and soliciting their input when considering various options			1
when patients play an active role in their medical decisions , studies show they tend to choose less aggressive treatment paths			2
there 's also the threat of malpractice , which makes it difficult for doctors to rein in tests			1
a recent survey of 1,214 orthopedic surgeons found that 30 % of the tests they ordered did n't help patients , and were mainly aimed at reducing exposure to liability suits			1
if doctors who restrict unnecessary testing according to the new guidelines can be provided with appropriate legal protection , then it 's more likely that they will actually do so			0
finally , whenever the topic of limiting tests is raised in today 's partisan environment , the specter of rationing is often brought up			0
back in 2009 when a recommendation against routine mammograms for women age 40 to 49 came out , there was a backlash despite the fact that the basis for it was scientifically reasonable			0
politicizing medical recommendations that are backed by solid research will only hinder doctors from doing a better job			1
today , discussing whether tests and treatments actually help patients or cause more harm does n't happen nearly enough			1
by providing a specific list of procedures to question -- and to cut down -- the medical community hopes to push us in the right direction			0
more people need to realize that limiting unnecessary tests is not rationing			0
it 's a way to potentially cut the waste out of our health system , and also reminds doctors of a promise they make to each and every patient : a promise to do no harm			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

about $ 700 billion of our $ 2 trillion annual health spending is considered wasteful medicine
@entity179 : a new guideline lists 45 tests and procedures that are performed too often
he says implementing the recommendations will not be easy for doctors and patients
*pho* : doctors and their patients need to talk more about what options are truly necessary
