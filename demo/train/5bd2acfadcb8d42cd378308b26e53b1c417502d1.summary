from the buzzing message boards on local social networking site @entity4 , to the hip campus of the @entity7 , young residents of the island are riding a wave of optimism following the historic announcement of a new deal with the @entity12 on december 17			1
" i hope for new investments in different areas of our economy , " says @entity13 , a young , privately - employed graphic designer in @entity14			1
" that means more work , more advertising			0
everybody who is ready to work hard will benefit			0
" across social media , mooted upgrades to internet infrastructure are causing as much excitement among young @entity27 as a new @entity29 launch would among their counterparts across the @entity32			1
a beleaguered workforce needs some good news			0
public sector wages are at around a quarter of 1989 levels at roughly $ 22 a month , national growth has slowed to 1.2 % , and traditional allies such as @entity39 and @entity40 have their own economic problems , limiting the value of their support			2
the agreement between presidents @entity45 and @entity46 offers a timely boost , although reforms are piecemeal			0
restrictions on business dealings and banking have been eased , while the remittance limit to @entity27 has quadrupled			1
but lifting the @entity12 embargo -- in place since 1961 -- would still need @entity56 approval			1
@entity27 's economy minister @entity58 has already revised growth estimates up for 2015 up to 4 %			1
part of this will come through traditional industries such as tobacco and rum , which should perform better as the new rules allow @entity12 visitors to import limited amounts			1
but private business can yield greater dividends			0
even before the @entity12 deal , the amount of privately employed people -- cuentapropistas -- had risen to around 500,000 , from just 150,000 in 2006			1
this growth had been matched with lay - offs in the state sector			0
" i think the @entity27 government concluded that outlawing small business was just pushing it underground , forcing people to buy goods and services illegally , " says professor @entity77 , a specialist in the @entity27 economy at @entity80 's @entity79			1
" for the convenience of everyday life ( private business ) was necessary , and it has been remarkably dynamic			0
" @entity89 expects tourism to offer major opportunities : " when travel for @entity12 becomes regular , there could be a tourism tsunami			1
in anticipation those in the hotel business are renovating old hotels , building new hotels and retirement homes , and low - cost apartments			0
this could see a big construction boom around tourism that spreads to areas like food and car rentals			1
" to fully grasp these opportunities , the @entity27 government would likely be forced into greater commercial liberalization			1
with fewer restrictions and greater investment , agriculture could expand its capacity and serve international markets			2
through its favorable climate , @entity27 can become " a winter garden for @entity117 , " @entity89 believes			1
the island also boasts an advanced biotech industry that is vital to the nation 's economic strategy , as well as its own high standards of healthcare			1
but to build its exports the government must consent to international testing and standardization			0
although president @entity46 has shown greater flexibility on private business than his predecessor -- brother @entity130 -- a more fundamental shift in approach would help the new generation of entrepreneurs			0
" the @entity27 government should provide a stronger legal basis for private businesses , giving them the same rights and duties as for the non-private companies " , says graphic designer @entity13			2
" without that , i think there will not be any serious economic growth			2
" evidence of such a fundamental shift can be seen in the port town of @entity146 , site of the @entity147			0
a " special economic zone " has been created , with the backing of @entity149 , allowing tax - free foreign investment in industries such as mining and manufacturing			0
" there are major real estate projects that the government would like to see , there could be billions of dollars of investment , " says @entity155 , editor of the @entity156 , the island 's only dedicated financial media			0
" but there has been a lot of insecurity around foreign investment -- the greatest being the @entity12 embargo			2
" " the @entity45 announcement sends the signal to investors that it 's ok to move ahead , as well as telling them that @entity12 investors may be here soon so be ready before their competition arrives			2
" improved internet infrastructure is a deal - breaker for this new vision of the @entity27 economy			1
grand - scale projects will not be sustained by a connection on the strength of satellite signals and a single fiber - optic cable from @entity39			0
the @entity12 has made a priority of co-operation on this issue , although these plans are viewed with skepticism , based on previous @entity12 efforts to subvert the government through social networks as well as open suggestions that the liberalization of the economy could help overthrow @entity46 's regime			1
" the problem is that the @entity45 proposal prioritizes private enterprise over the state economy with the idea being to strengthen capitalism on the island , " says @entity197 , editor of the @entity199 news site			0
" this contradicts our society that has tried to defend and protect social access to our resources ... if @entity12 intentions is to impose capitalism here through seduction it will not be successful			2
" while the leaders of both nations have declared a commitment to co-operation with respect for ideological differences , it remains to be seen whether the decades - old phoney war will continue by other means			0
an isolated pariah , or bread basket of @entity117 ? @entity27 's path is open .			2

@entity27 has new opportunities following historic deal with @entity12
economic liberalization already occurring with 500,000 privately employed
biotech , tourism , and agriculture could boom , @entity234 should be *dramatically* improved
the new alliance will not remove *mutual* *suspicion*
