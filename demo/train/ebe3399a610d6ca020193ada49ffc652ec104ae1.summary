@entity1 tensions in both political parties dominated this week 's final trip around the ' @entity5 ' table			2
@entity6 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			0
seething over @entity11 look for more open battles between the @entity14 @entity13 and congressional democrats as we move into 2015			1
@entity17 of the @entity18 described @entity13 officials as " privately still pretty angry " at @entity21 @entity20 sen. @entity11 for saying the president was wrong to prioritize health care legislation over other issues in his first term			1
and there is also bad blood after the @entity13 pulled the plug on senate majority leader @entity30 's effort to negotiate a tax package with congressional @entity32			1
" i think we 're going to see in the weeks and months ahead a real sort of division starting to emerge , especially as the @entity13 starts to really press on trade , which is an issue that divides @entity20 , " said @entity17			2
" i think we 're going to see that daylight get even brighter			0
@entity39 's secret weapon house speaker @entity39 makes clear he has no interest in shutting the government down , and is no question in stronger political shape than he was in some past battles with the conservative grass roots			1
but stronger does n't mean he does n't appreciate a little help , and @entity47 of the @entity48 took us inside efforts by the newest member of the leadership team to help keep the @entity32 troops in line			1
at issue : the work of @entity13 whip rep. @entity57 of @entity58			2
" he has been able to finagle this thing for the last few days and make sure that conservatives feel like they are part of the process in the @entity13 leadership and that they 're not looking for a showdown the way they did a year ago when they got a shutdown over health care reform , " said @entity47			1
room for a " nerd " in the @entity32 2016 pack ? there are a half dozen @entity32 governors mulling 2016 presidential runs , including the @entity74 of @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity58 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
but @entity80 of the @entity18 says keep an eye on the self - described " nerd " who was just re-elected in the blue state of @entity85			0
@entity80 talked to @entity86 when he was in @entity87 this past week getting an award from @entity89			0
" it 's this great dance , @entity91 , as you know , " said @entity80			2
" you talk to these politicians and they are waiting for you to ask the question and finally you do : ' so do you want to run for president ? ' " " and of course he has to answer that right now he is fully focused on @entity85 and telling the @entity85 story and chief in that is that the unemployment rate has dropped in that state that was so hard hit during the recession			0
but he is someone that at the very least wants to be in the mix for 2016			0
a 2016 litmus test for @entity107 ? president @entity14 's executive actions on immigration are not only infuriating key conservatives in @entity111 -- they are triggering legal challenges from many states , and in a way that could ripple into the 2016 presidential race			1
@entity116 of the @entity48 notes that the governors of @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity58 are signatories to the suit , as is the @entity32 governor of @entity121			2
all factor into 2016 talk of potential candidates or maybe vice presidential picks on the @entity32 side			1
but @entity127 notes one glaring name not on the list : @entity79 gov. @entity107			2
" @entity107 has said so far that he does n't want to talk at all about immigration reform -- he wo n't do that unless he decides to run , " said @entity127			1
" but it is a question of whether or not this lawsuit will be kind of a litmus test going forward in 2016 and whether or not he is going to be pressured to sign on and how he 's going to navigate that			1
@entity139 announcement -- maybe later there is nothing certain when it comes to @entity143 , but the safer bet appears to be later rather than sooner as to when we will get official word about her 2016 intentions			0
the timing debate has been going on for months			0
some allies believe an early announcement -- as in by the end of 2014 - is best , to end the doubts and bring early order to the organization			0
others say there is little reason to rush , noting the lack of a formidable opponent and the added scrutiny and requirements that come with being a candidate in the eyes of the law			0
the former secretary of state is holding meetings to discuss her team , but is described by friends as not in too much of a hurry to make a final decision and then let it be known			0
so , for now anyway , the betting is she will wait a bit into 2015 .			0
