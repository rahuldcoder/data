just days after four @entity0 were united for the first time in 800 years at the @entity2 in @entity3 , another ancient version of the document has been discovered by chance in a medieval coastal town in @entity9			1
@entity10 , an archivist in @entity11 , southern @entity9 , found the previously unknown version of the @entity13 -- which established the principle that everybody , including the king , was subject to the law -- after historian @entity18 had asked him to look for a separate document dealing with a local forest that he was researching			1
after rummaging through a scrapbook of council archives , @entity10 found the @entity24 , a document issued by @entity26 in 1217 , as well as a tattered page that he thought looked like the @entity13			1
" he was n't really aware of the fact that they were either rare or that this one was indeed what it purported to be			0
i think , from his point of view , it was all a bit of a shock , " said @entity18 , professor of medieval history at the @entity34			2
but he says there is no doubt that this is a version of the @entity13 , or " @entity44 , " that was published in 1300 under the reign of @entity41 i. the original document was issued by @entity9 's @entity43 in 1215			1
the document is badly damaged , with a third of its text and the royal seal of @entity41 missing and the back of it firmly stuck down			0
but despite its deformities , @entity18 said it could fetch millions			1
" it [ the damage ] probably would interfere with the value of it if someone were foolish enough to sell it , " he said			0
" but i think there 's no question of that			0
" this one is in nothing like the condition of the one that went for sale in @entity70 [ in 2007 , for $ 21.3 million ] but i would say it 's certainly worth in the millions rather than in the tens and hundreds of thousands			2
and as a pair , they are all the more desirable			0
" and other discoveries have been made as well			0
" the fact that they [ @entity13 and @entity24 ] are both there in @entity11 is particularly interesting because there is no royal forest in @entity81			2
that really tells us something that we really did n't know before about the way that the document was published , " @entity18 said			1
" and given that this is the most important document in @entity9 history , people make such a fuss about it , to find out anything new about it is rather exciting			2
" this is a hugely significant gain for @entity11			0
" through the @entity94 , continuing in the @entity95 , @entity13 still underpins individual liberties worldwide , " said the town 's mayor , @entity97			1
to own such a document , and the @entity24 , is an honor and a great responsibility			0
" " what matters is @entity11 now becomes one of a very small number of institutions -- there are only about a dozen -- that own a @entity13 , " said @entity18			1
" there are lots and lots of institutions across the @entity112 and elsewhere in the world that would love to have this document			0

a version of the @entity13 published in 1300 has *apparently* been found in an @entity9 town
the document was discovered by chance in council archives
historian @entity18 said " it 's certainly worth in the millions "
