@entity0 , @entity1 -- for 42 years , @entity3 ruled @entity1 with an iron fist , a mercurial leader who inspired fear in @entity1 and beyond			1
now he 's on the run , hunted by rebels who made a lightning advance into @entity0			0
the rebels overran @entity3 's compound and are scouring the country for signs of the leader , who has not been seen in public for weeks			1
on thursday , a radio station aired a defiant message , purportedly from @entity3 , but most other signs point to the end of @entity3 's long rule			1
the 69 - year - old strongman came to power in a bloodless coup against @entity23 in 1969 , when he was just an army captain			1
by the end of his rule , he claimed to be " @entity25 , " a title he had a gathering of tribal leaders grant him in 2008			0
the fighting that dislodged @entity3 started with anti-government demonstrations in february and escalated into a nationwide civil war			1
the protests started days after the fall of former @entity35 president @entity34 , whom @entity3 had supported			1
that month , @entity3 vowed to never leave @entity1 and to " die as a martyr at the end			1
" for months , rebel fighters -- in control of the eastern city of @entity41 and other areas -- had been trying to move closer toward @entity0 , in the west			1
recent advances allowed them to cut off some key supply routes for @entity3 , bringing them closest yet to their goal , and by august 21 , they had broken through into the capital			2
the following morning , raucous rebel supporters packed the city 's @entity50 , the same place where the longtime leader 's supporters had gathered for months to voice their loyalty			0
by tuesday evening , @entity3 's @entity57 compound was being ransacked			2
when @entity3 assumed power , he fashioned himself as an @entity60 nationalist			1
the @entity61 tried to work with him at first , but quickly found out that his brand of nationalism included opposition to the @entity65			1
by 1972 he was urging muslims to fight @entity68 powers , including the @entity61 and @entity69 , and backing black militants in the @entity61 as he pursued a leadership position in the @entity60 world			1
his " @entity78 , " first published in 1975 , envisioned a radically simple system of " @entity74 " that would replace political structures from tribes to parliaments			0
@entity60 leaders largely shunned him , seeing him more as a " buffoon " and a " clown " than a potential @entity83 leader , said @entity84 , a @entity1 expert at @entity85			0
that rejection from @entity60 and @entity88 leaders , combined with his growing anti-western sentiment , left him to turn to terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s , @entity84 said			0
in 1986 , @entity1 was implicated in the fatal bombing at a @entity93 nightclub that left one @entity61 service member dead , prompting then - @entity61 president @entity95 to dub the @entity1 leader the " mad dog of the @entity98			2
" @entity95 ordered the @entity61 to bomb @entity1 and imposed economic sanctions against the @entity88 country			2
two years later , @entity1 was implicated in the 1988 bombing of @entity102 , which exploded over @entity103 , @entity104			0
years later , @entity3 appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the @entity65			1
in 1999 , he turned over suspects in the @entity103 bombing , and in 2003 the country agreed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction			0
in the years before the current rebellion started , @entity3 even hired a public relations firm to burnish his global image as a statesman and a reformer			2
starting in 2006 , the leader spent about $ 3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think - tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to @entity1 for lectures , discussions and personal meetings with @entity3			2
in 2009 , he addressed the @entity124 for the first and only time			0
in his 96 - minute ramble , he denounced the @entity126 as a " terror council , " suggested the @entity129 swine - flu virus was a military tool and called for renewed investigations into the assassinations of @entity133 and @entity134 earlier this year , as people around the @entity98 and @entity88 began to challenge their leaders in the so - called @entity138 movement , @entity3 found himself a target			1
but while longtime @entity35 president @entity34 was ousted after a few weeks , and even after the eastern @entity1 city of @entity41 fell to the rebels , @entity3 fought on and blamed outsiders , " armed gangs " and others for the violence			1
in the end , the @entity1 leader sealed his reputation with his crackdown on protesters and attacks against rebels and civilians alike			0
recently , international leaders accused @entity3 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians			2
the @entity126 subsequently issued a no - fly zone over @entity1 and approved " all necessary measures " short of invasion to protect civilians			0
officials in the @entity3 regime , in turn , repeatedly accused @entity166 of killing civilians in airstrikes			2
in april , @entity3 wrote a letter to @entity61 president @entity170 , urging him to end the @entity166 bombing of his war - torn country			1
@entity3 asked @entity170 to stop what he called the " unjust war against a small people of a developing country , " adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of @entity181			0
the @entity166 operations continued , however			0
in june , the @entity183 issued arrest warrants for @entity3 , his son @entity185 , and his brother - in - law @entity186			0
the warrants are " for crimes against humanity , " including murder and persecution , " allegedly committed across @entity1 " from february 15 through " at least " february 28 , " through the state apparatus and security forces , " the court said in a statement			0
@entity2 's @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
