-- @entity1 should n't be at the @entity2 , and it has nothing to do with the @entity4 being the @entity5 of this year 's tournament			1
@entity1 is an underdog story all by himself			2
now 26 and allowed to play only via a special @entity10 medical waiver , there was a time @entity1 thought he 'd never play basketball again			1
but through the diligence and tenacity that has been a signature of the no. 9 - seeded @entity4 ' historic run into the @entity16 ( they 're the second - lowest seed to ever make it this far ) , @entity1 has demonstrated he was game for a comeback			1
when the 6 - foot - 8 senior from @entity22 , @entity23 , first took the floor in 2007 to play at @entity25 , his college career lasted all of three games			1
after visiting a doctor to diagnose the latest in a series of fainting spells that had been ongoing since high school , his career was shut down because of a heart condition			1
the condition caused what is known as neurocardiogenic syncope , a loss of consciousness often caused by decreased blood to the brain			1
remember when president @entity41 choked on the pretzel in 2002 ? or when @entity44 president @entity43 collapsed while jogging in 2009 ? both episodes were attributed to syncope			0
like that , @entity1 went from junior - college baller to a $ 12 - an - hour , assembly - line bulb painter working the graveyard shift at a lighting company in his hometown			1
it was a tough blow for the then - 19 - year - old			0
" he got so depressed , " his mother , @entity55 , told @entity56			0
" for a while there , i thought , ' this boy thinks his life was over			0
' " @entity1 stayed in school , paying his own way after losing his scholarship , and attended morning classes after his shifts ended at 7 a.m. his grades suffered , according to media reports			2
the best teams that did n't win it all in 2009 , doctors gave him exciting news			0
if he wanted , he could return to the court , they said , but @entity1 was tentative			2
" once you pass out you do n't want to go through that situation again , " @entity1 told @entity76			2
rather than go back to college , he went to the rec center , where he began playing in a church league			2
when coach @entity82 heard of the development , he told @entity84 he could return to @entity23 , the @entity56 reported			0
@entity55 was worried it was n't the best move for her son , but @entity1 told her he was willing to take the risk			2
" i said if anything happens to me while i play basketball , i can live with it , " @entity1 told the newspaper			1
" she said if i can live with it , she can			0
" he averaged almost 19 points and more than 11 rebounds a game , leading @entity23 to the national junior college tournament			2
the next year , he transferred to @entity98 , where that production continued			0
with a marksman - like 59 % shooting , @entity1 averaged almost 18 points and 10 rebounds a game -- not to mention 2.3 blocks -- and was named 2011 @entity105			1
by then , he 'd already been on @entity4 coach @entity107 's radar			1
@entity107 recalled for @entity108 the first time he saw the young man play			0
" i said to my staff , ' i want that guy right there			0
the guy with the hair , ' " @entity107 said , referring to the dreadlocks @entity1 sported up until a few days before the @entity2			2
@entity107 had his reservations , though			0
it was n't that @entity1 did n't have what it took to be a shocker , but @entity107 had been rocked by a player 's heart problem in the past			1
just after accepting the @entity4 post , @entity107 was watching one of his recruits , a @entity128 from @entity129 named @entity130 , play a pick - up game when the kid collapsed , dead on the floor			1
" i 'm watching him play pickup and 15 minutes later he just lurches back and it 's over			0
that was my second day on the job , " he told @entity108			0
despite @entity1 's successes at @entity23 and @entity139 , he was n't quite up for the task of playing @entity10 ball			1
he was out of shape , sometimes taking breaks during team sprints , and he was frightened to push himself at first			0
@entity107 was also unwilling to crack the whip			0
" i did n't want to be the coach who made him pass out or worse , " @entity107 told @entity108			0
@entity1 spent the off - season on the track , on the treadmill and on the stationary bike			1
during a preseason practice , he was running suicides -- a grueling series of sprints whose lengths increase in intervals -- when he realized he could finally give it 100 % , according to the @entity56			0
he 's now making the most of the @entity10 medical waivers that granted him a sixth season of eligibility			2
after averaging more than eight points and five rebounds as a junior -- and snaring the @entity167 's newcomer of the year award -- the 26 - year - old forward has become a force			1
on top of 12.5 points and seven rebounds a game , @entity1 plays mean defense , averaging almost two blocks a game			2
you can ask the no. 2 - seeded @entity178 about it -- that is , if they 're willing to talk after @entity1 's six swatted shots helped the @entity4 sink the favored @entity183 opponent last weekend			1
that upset came two days after a 72 - 58 dismantling of the @entity186 -- on the back of @entity1 's 16 - point , eight - rebound , three - block performance -- and a week after the @entity4 lived up to their name by edging out the @entity190 , one of the tournament 's top - seeded teams			1
next up is perhaps @entity4 's most daunting challenge : a truly menacing @entity197 team that has n't lost since february 9 and is averaging almost 81 points per game in the tournament			1
with the exception of @entity203 , which lost to @entity197 by eight , no one has even stayed on the floor with the @entity197 , who whipped a vaunted @entity207 squad by 22 on sunday			0
the @entity4 will go into @entity209 's @entity208 on saturday as 11 - point underdogs , but @entity4 is used to playing the role			1
they 've already knocked off one no. 1 seed on the road to the college hoops championship			2
should they continue to defy the oddsmakers and win it all , the @entity216 university of almost 15,000 students will become the lowest - seeded school to ever do it , topping the 1985 no. 8 - seeded @entity222 team			1
but that 's getting ahead of ourselves			0
right now , @entity1 is just enjoying being there			0
" it 's like i 'm in a dream right now , you know , and i 'm just trying to take advantage of this whole opportunity , " he told @entity108 .			0

@entity1 's heart condition *threatened* to end his college basketball career in 2007
the condition caused neurocardiogenic syncope , a loss of consciousness
after playing at two junior colleges , @entity4 picked him up before junior season
@entity1 's six blocked shots *instrumental* in @entity4 ' upset of no. 2 - seeded @entity178
