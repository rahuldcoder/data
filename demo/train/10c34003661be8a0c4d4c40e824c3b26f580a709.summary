" he noted that @entity10 's feet were still on the ground			2

then they dragged his body away , " @entity31 said in statement on its website			0
" i 've never witnessed a suicide like this , " said @entity87 , communications director at @entity31			0
how do you hang yourself with your feet on the ground ? " despite the family 's claims that they were n't allowed to take photos , three images of @entity10 said to have been taken after his death have been published on @entity100 , a @entity102 - based @entity4 - language news website			1

@entity1 tried repeatedly to contact @entity113 where @entity10 died but no one answered the phone			2
an official who answered the phone at the publicity office of @entity119 said he had n't heard of @entity10 's case and advised calling another number			1
attempts to call other government offices also failed			0
it 's not known how long @entity10 had been in hospital before his death			1
@entity31 said only that he was being treated for his " deteriorating health			0
" @entity69 told @entity31 that authorities started monitoring @entity10 on may 22			2
friends said the phones of @entity10 's sister @entity71 and brother - in - law @entity69 do n't appear to be working			1
they say they believe the couple has been detained in a hotel near the hospital where @entity10 died			1
earlier , @entity10 's family and rights campaigners called for an immediate investigation and full autopsy to determine his cause of death			1
" the @entity4 authorities must thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding @entity10 's death and take seriously the claims made by his family and friends that this was not suicide , " said @entity140 , @entity141 deputy director at @entity142			1
in the hours after @entity10 's death , a petition appeared online urging his " suicide " to be investigated by authorities outside @entity12 province and for the findings to be made public			1
it was started by @entity0 - based journalist @entity158 , @entity4 economist @entity159 and literary scholar @entity160			2
