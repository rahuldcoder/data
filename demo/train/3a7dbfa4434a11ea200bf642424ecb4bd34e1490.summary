-- it happens at the end of january every year -- an apparently mad and desperate dash to sign players as @entity7 football 's transfer window draws to an agonizing close			1
club officials man the phones , fax machines at the ready to sneak registrations inside the deadline			0
football agents , desperate to secure their clients a lucrative last - minute move , frantically try to negotiate contracts and transfer fees before the clock strikes midnight and the chance has disappeared			1
it often seems like a classic case of panic - buying , as clubs seek to bolster their squads for the second half of the season , but the last - day scramble is the culmination of weeks of negotiations between all the involved parties , says @entity33 agent @entity32			1
" generally speaking , if somebody genuinely wants to buy a player , they will have earmarked him well before the window opens , " says @entity32 , who represented former @entity35 stars such as @entity36 and @entity37			1
who are january 's top transfer targets ? " you 've got to have a player that wants to leave and wants to join the club who wants to buy him			1
so you 've got to push all of those pieces together , which sometimes is a lot more difficult than it sounds			0
" since 2002 , @entity7 clubs have only been able to add to their rosters during two transfer windows -- which generally run in the offseason between july 1 and august 31 and midseason throughout the month of january			1
as a result , deadline day has become a biannual ritual , with fans glued to tv screens in the hope their club will pull off a shock transfer coup			2
@entity32 says the restrictions the windows have placed on clubs have added extra strain to transfer negotiations			1
" there will have been some sort of contact , either formal or informal , well before the window opens , " he explained			2
" so if you date it from there to when the player actually signs , i 'd say you 're talking about an average of three or four weeks			0
" i 've got one or two deals that are bubbling under			2
people wait until the last minute and it 's absolutely ridiculous			2
these deals could have happened weeks ago and yet managers are jockeying for position , they do n't get the money from the club and then the club changes its mind at the last minute			2
" @entity32 says the 1992 transfer of @entity37 , who was then 25 and in his prime , from @entity94 club @entity93 to @entity96 - based @entity95 was particularly difficult			1
" the injuries , the financial problems @entity93 were experiencing , the tax money element of it -- it was a very complicated transaction , it really was , " he recalls			0
" i lived and breathed it for months			0
i had an all - night session with @entity95 , worked all the way through the night and did n't go to bed			2
" @entity7 football 's governing body @entity107 has attempted to cut reckless spending by introducing financial fair play regulations -- a set of rules which sanction clubs for spending beyond their means			1
@entity32 believes the eagerness of teams to lower their wage bills and conform to the new rules has changed how transfers are set in motion , with clubs now eager to offload high - earning stars			1
" a couple of years ago , 95 % of transfers would have been player instigated			0
nowadays , with the financial restraints on clubs , i would say over 50 % are club instigated , " he says			0
" i had a player who was astonished to learn that i 'd been phoned by a manager who was telling me that my player was available because he was fairly high on that club 's wage list and they wanted to reduce their budget			0
" this year 's january window has been dominated by one player whose club want remove him from the wage bill , @entity143 's @entity142			1
the @entity145 striker has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with the @entity148 leaders since being fined by the club for refusing to come on as a substitute during a @entity152 match with @entity153 in september			0
@entity142 has been linked with @entity155 giants @entity156 and @entity157 and big - spending @entity159 outfit @entity158 , but was looking likely to remain at @entity143 as the deadline approached			0
so what would be @entity32 's advice to the 27 - year - old , who captained @entity143 to the club 's first trophy in 35 years last season and topped the team 's scoring charts -- but has not played for @entity143 since the incident in @entity171 ? " you 've got @entity143 who want him out but do n't want to lose a fortune			1
you 've got @entity142 jogging along a beach in @entity176 and you 've any number of people putting him around to clubs who probably ca n't afford him anyway , " @entity32 says			1
" that is a total nightmare transaction			0
i 'm not saying it 's one i would n't like to be involved in because it would be an enormous challenge to see that one through			0
" i 'd say , ' you 're a professional footballer , you 're only going to be playing until you 're 35 , you need to get yourself playing			0
this is stupid , you 've got to do something			0
