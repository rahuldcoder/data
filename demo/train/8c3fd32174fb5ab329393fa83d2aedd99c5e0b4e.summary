@entity0 , @entity1 -- visualize an @entity1 pub : there 's likely fiddles , pints , and smoke -- and lots of it			1
while that may be a reality in some @entity1 pubs abroad , that has n't been entirely the case in @entity1 for the last decade			1
march 29 marked the 10 - year anniversary of a workplace smoking ban in @entity1 , extending to pubs and restaurants			1
@entity1 was the first country worldwide to enact such a sweeping ban			1
the initiative made smoking in enclosed workplaces illegal , punishable by a fine of up to 3,000 euros , or about $ 4,200			2
the ban has spawned copycat laws across the globe			2
@entity26 and @entity27 followed that same year , as did @entity28			0
now , dozens of countries from @entity30 to @entity31 have joined @entity1 in creating a nationwide workplace smoking ban -- the @entity33 not among them			1
@entity35 will join the list in june			0
@entity1 minister for health dr. @entity37 has hailed the ban as a success , stating the proof is in the numbers			1
" recent research found 3,726 fewer smoking related deaths than would have been expected if the smoking ban had not been brought in , " said @entity37 , who lost his father and brother to smoking - related illnesses , in a statement			1
" this is indisputable evidence that the ban is saving lives and improving our overall health as a nation			1
" indeed , @entity1 's @entity56 says the smoking prevalence rate has decreased more than 7 % since the launch of the ban , dropping from 28.86 % in march 2004 to 21.48 % in december 2013			1
who : imminent global cancer ' disaster ' reflects aging , lifestyle factors but while statistics demonstrate a national decline in post-ban smoking , you might not see evidence of that everywhere			2
asked if the ban has helped her smoke less , social smoker @entity70 of @entity0 counters : " more			2
" " i would n't have smoked before the law , " @entity74 says			0
" you 'd be inside and everyone was there			0
but when you went out to meet people , you 'd be more inclined to take a cigarette because there was more pressure			0
everyone was smoking outside , so you 'd take one ... so , i think it 's actually had the opposite effect			1
" even nonsmokers , a group with which @entity74 identifies , are taking up casual smoking , " in hopes you might meet the perfect partner , i think , " she adds			2
and statistically , @entity74 's hypothesis is correct			2
since the ban , the number of occasional ( five or fewer cigarettes a day ) and light smokers ( between six and 10 cigarettes a day ) actually has increased , according to @entity1 's @entity99 ( @entity99 )			1
meanwhile , the @entity99 shows 18 - 24 year olds now make up the largest group of smokers , edging out 25 - 34 year olds who dominated nationwide prior to the launch of the ban			2
furthermore , when you examine the 3,726 lives estimated spared since the ban 's initiation , they are primarily attributed to a decline in " passive smoking " or secondhand smoke , according to a 2013 report " reductions in @entity114 , @entity115 , and @entity116 following the @entity117 , " published in the journal @entity120			1
it seems smokers at pubs have n't stopped ; they 've just moved into the open air			0
standing outside a @entity0 pub with a cigarette , @entity125 talks about the patron reaction to the ban			2
" ( @entity130 ) basically just do what they 're told , so when ( the ban ) came in , they went outside straightaway , " he says			1
not everyone adjusted so quickly , however			0
one politician staged a very public protest			0
after lighting a cigarette at a bar inside the @entity144 building just days after the ban 's launch , @entity139 , the justice spokesman for @entity1 's largest political party , was relieved of his position			1
one year later , @entity1 news site @entity148 quoted him as saying he stood by his choice to light up , and always would			1
but 10 years later , @entity139 is back in political office and has gone mum , declining comment on the ban 's anniversary			1
in the tiny town of @entity158 in southwest @entity1 , bartender @entity156 says smokers at pubs will still smoke			1
" i 'm still a smoker , unfortunately			0
smoking less , " says @entity156			0
" i know a few people that because they have to stand outside said it was n't them , that they did n't want to be standing out in the cold , and have people seeing them standing out having a cigarette			0
it just was n't right			0
some of them tried to give it up , but they did n't succeed			0
" largest - ever tobacco study finds ' urgent need ' for policy change it 's that shaming , according to @entity174 , spokesman for smokers ' rights group @entity175 , that makes the ban ineffectual			1
he says the workplace ban infringes on @entity1 freedoms and impedes business , especially in rural areas			1
" in small villages , the pub was really the social center in the town			0
that all came to a halt after the ban , " says @entity174			0
" slowly , but surely , the country areas were the ones most badly hit -- but everywhere was hit			0
" indeed , @entity1 has seen a rash of drinking institutions close since the ban , according to the @entity193 of @entity1			1
in 2013 , 1,300 fewer licensed premises were documented than in 2005 , with rural communities showing the largest loss percentage -- a decline surely due in part to a recession in @entity1 from 2008 to 2013			1
despite this , @entity174 says pub business is actually picking up these days , a shift he attributes to the introduction of the e-cigarette			0
" there 's a bit of a drift back now , a social drift back to the bars , but it 's got more to do with electronic cigarettes than anything else			0
and having discovered how bad the smoking ban could be for business , pubs now positively encourage you to ' vape ' away in the corner if you want to , or at the bar			2
we still have no legislation on that , and do n't need any either , incidentally			0
" e-cigarettes and " vaping " have become common fare in @entity1 pubs , and offer a new loophole to the workplace law			1
the @entity1 government is examining where e-cigarettes will fit into the goal of a tobacco - free @entity1 by 2025 ( that 's a smoking prevalence rate of less than 5 % )			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's @entity231 says two - thirds of the total population , and rising , are in favor of the smoking ban , including 40 % of smokers			1
" i fully agree with the smoking ban in pubs , " says @entity156			2
" places are much cleaner			0
the stain smell of smoke , you do n't have that anymore			0
" beyond fresher upholstery , pub patrons and staff are hailing cleaner lungs			0
in 2005 , one year after the ban began , the @entity248 for a @entity249 examined secondhand smoke exposure in 42 @entity0 bars and among 73 bar workers , finding an 83 % reduction in air pollution in bars , an 80 % decrease in airborne carcinogens , and an improvement in the respiratory health of bar workers			2
but businesses are still growing accustomed to managing a tradition employed by nearly a quarter of the total population , a percentage that surely escalates when specifically examining the habits of pub patrons			0
is obesity the next smoking ? though few and far between , violators of the ban have received penance			2
in march , @entity1 's @entity272 received a 750 - euro fine ( about $ 1,040 ) after patrons were found smoking inside its popular @entity0 pub , @entity277			1
it 's a lingering punishment that keeps patrons who puff tucked in a blue haze just beyond pub doors , for worse or , sometimes , for better			0
" i met my last two girlfriends from smoking outside with them , and they were both smokers			0
if you ca n't dance , i would say start smoking			0
that 's where you 're going to meet women , " says @entity125 .			2

@entity1 was the world 's first nation to ban smoking in public places
health officials hail the ban as a success
however , some in @entity1 say they 're actually smoking more
e-cigarettes have become a popular alternative
