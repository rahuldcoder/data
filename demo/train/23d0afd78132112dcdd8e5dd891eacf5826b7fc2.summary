-- who takes the cake : @entity3 or @entity4 ? as part of our @entity7 project pitting rival cities against each other , @entity3 beat @entity4 in our completely unscientific poll , gaining 52 % of the approximately 7,000 votes cast , compared with @entity4 's 48 %			1
but @entity13 walloped @entity3 in enthusiastic support for their city , sharing our @entity4 lover 's column on @entity4 's virtues more than 30,000 times on @entity20 , compared with 1,400 endorsements for our transplanted @entity3 's love letter to @entity3			1
and that robust participation from the @entity24 translated into more than 500 reader comments on the @entity4 story , compared with 150 on the @entity3 installment of the smackdown			1
we asked ireporters and commenters to share the very best things about their respective cities and why they like them better than any other			2
some felt the need to add a little trash talk			2
you decide if they 're right			2
talking a little smack @entity3 inspires people to accomplish great things they could not imagine anywhere else , according to @entity42 of @entity43 , in @entity44			1
" that greatness is just around the corner , always in @entity3			1
you never know what kind of fortuitous kindling this city will throw at you			2
" @entity3 is the center of the modern world , claims @entity52 , a former @entity4 resident			1
" finance , real estate , publishing -- it 's almost too much for an @entity13 to take in			2
i should know because i used to be one			2
" not so , claims @entity4 defender cornholio5			1
" @entity4 intimidates people because they 're afraid to admit it 's better than where they 're from			1
in @entity4 , we order bagels from people that do n't yell at us			1
we do n't care if your pizza is better			2
we like ours , but we like yours , too			2
we legally smoke weed , we surf , we go to work in flip - flops and we drive @entity73			2
we work hard , we 're laid back , we eat avocados and we do yoga			2
we respect @entity76 , and do n't even expect it back			2
that 's how we roll			0
" residents of @entity4 rave about the good weather , and more			1
" @entity4 has the better weather , the better technology , the car capital of the world , better jobs , better food and better people , " writes another commenter			1
" @entity3 : you pay outrageous rent , and who wants to pay $ 1,000/month just to park your car ? " let 's go out and play in @entity3 we admit it , both cities have great places to play , whether you 're splurging or traveling on a budget			1
@entity3 offers full price theater tickets to " @entity100 " and discount theater tickets at the tkts booth			1
make reservations to @entity104 or @entity105 for fine dining or grab an affordable ( and incredible ) burger and cheese fries at @entity109 in @entity110 or " chicken fried chicken " at @entity112 in the @entity113			0
ireporter @entity114 , who grew up on @entity44 's @entity116 and lives in @entity117 in the @entity118 , offers you her walking tour route , free of charge			0
" one of my favorite things to do with friends who visit me is to start walking from the bottom of @entity44 , " she writes			0
" we start at the @entity125 , walk north through @entity126 , @entity127 , the @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 & @entity134			0
and that is only day one ! " " every nook and cranny of the city exudes its own pleasures , flavors and personality , " claims @entity136			0
" i honestly do n't think you can ever see it all			0
from the @entity146 cottage in the @entity118 to the site of the ... @entity149 in @entity150 , there is always something to see that will wow you ! " @entity160 to @entity159 , says @entity155 , @entity156 , resident and @entity158 , who visits @entity3 regularly to see her son			1
" @entity159 is at the heart of what this country is about			0
like the @entity165 rising from its ashes , @entity3 is building up from the horrors of 9/11			1
this rebuilding of structure and attitude makes @entity3 the greatest city on @entity172			1
it will not be destroyed in building or beliefs			0
" let 's play in @entity4 @entity4 offers everything from swimming and surfing at the beach to skiing in the mountains and camping in the desert			1
a short drive ( traffic permitting ) will get you to some of the most beautiful outdoor spots in the world			0
" the feeling is laid back while you cruise down @entity190 and dig on the celebrities , " writes @entity188			0
" @entity4 is the entertainment capital of the world , from the @entity195 film industry to all of the great concerts and clubs , we beat @entity44 hands down ! and those @entity195 nights , those @entity195 hills			1
" ( with thanks to @entity201			0
) @entity202 , who lives in @entity204 but also loves @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity195 and @entity207 , never wears anything heavier than a hoodie because the weather is so fabulous			2
" it 's definitely the spot to be in for surfing , skateboarding and snowboarding			0
life is a little more laid back and you get to enjoy the beauty of nature that surrounds you			0
" standouts to commenter @entity220 : @entity221 , summer movies at @entity223 , monthly downtown @entity224 , the @entity226 , @entity227 ( or any of the downtown rooftop bars ) , driving around actual film studios , @entity230 ( hipster bar in @entity232 ) , the @entity233 , @entity234 ( contemporary museum ) , @entity235 and " hiking up to the @entity195 sign or any of the hundreds of amazing hiking trails all throughout the hills and mountains of the city			0
" let 's eat some good food there 's no shortage of advice online or in print on the best cuisine in @entity4 or @entity3			1
both towns have food critics who have their preferences for high - end , low - end and everything in between -- although only @entity4 can claim the first winner of a @entity254 for food criticism in @entity256 , now at the " @entity257			1
" if you 're craving a particular cuisine or need to eat in a particular part of town , plenty of foodie websites can help you out			0
if you 're talking to residents , make sure they really like food -- because there 's plenty of bad food to be had in both cities			0
@entity44 resident @entity270 loves the @entity271 for the feel of old @entity3 , drinks at the @entity274 and the chocolate waterfall brunch at the @entity276			1
for vegetarians and vegans , @entity270 recommends @entity280 restaurant			0
" it 's a raw food restaurant that delivers the most exquisite flavors imaginable			0
you will not believe it is raw food			0
" former @entity4 resident and @entity286 @entity285 has many favorite restaurants and bars to recommend : " @entity289 ( near downtown ) , @entity291 's @entity292 ( @entity293 ) , @entity295 's @entity294 ( @entity296 or @entity293 ) , @entity297 ( @entity298 ) , @entity299 ( @entity293 ) , @entity300 ( @entity129 ) , @entity301 's @entity302 , @entity304 frozen yogurt ( @entity298 ) , @entity306 's bakery ( @entity307 )			1
" and yes , @entity309 food can be found almost anywhere in @entity4			1
however , commenter @entity311 suggests visitors move beyond the assumption of @entity309 food as beans , rice , tacos , burritos and enchiladas			0
" @entity13 know better ( and ) we take advantage of all the delicious @entity322 cuisine , especially mariscos , @entity324 cusine , @entity326 cusine and so many more , " he writes			0
pitting one city against the other is pointless , say some , like comparing an suv to a sports car			0
" if you want a house with a big yard , pool and palm trees , @entity3 is not the place for you , " writes commenter @entity332 , who was raised in @entity4 and visits @entity3			1
" if you want to live in a high - rise building in a pedestrian - friendly neighborhood where you can take the subway to work , your lifestyle options in @entity4 will be rather limited			1
" @entity347 is married to @entity3 , but it 's not exclusive			2
" @entity3 is home for me , but @entity4 is my secret lover , " she writes			1
" ca n't beat the way you can walk @entity44 and meet people along the way , meander in and out of shops , restaurants , etc. you just ca n't do that in @entity4 but the sunshine , beaches and palm trees and the laid back vibe in @entity4 are golden			2
if there was a way to combine the two , it would be paradise			0
" both cities , it seems , are willing to share the people they love with the city on the opposite coast			0
next on our smackdown list : @entity373 , @entity374 , home to the @entity376 , versus @entity377 , @entity378 , home to the @entity379			0
