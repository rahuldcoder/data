-- maybe this @entity2 " purple haze " issue is n't such a big deal after all			1
in the few weeks that the phone has been on the market , a number of users have grumbled about a purplish glow appearing in their photos when the lens is angled toward the sun. because no detail about @entity17 is too trivial to go unreported by the tech press , their complaints were magnified throughout the blogosphere			2
but @entity20 said wednesday that this effect is not unusual			2
the respected product - review publication tested the @entity2 and found that it is " no more prone to purple hazing on photos shot into a bright light source than its predecessor or than several @entity28 phones with fine cameras			1
" the @entity2 5 's purple - haze effect was no more pronounced than with the @entity31 or two @entity28 - based smartphones , the @entity33 and the @entity34 , when tested those under the same conditions , @entity20 said			1
" all camera lenses , even those made for expensive slrs , can yield lens flare , which is produced by scattered reflections inside the lens from a bright light source , " @entity20 added			0
" how much flare appears in an image depends on how you orient the lens			0
" @entity17 said basically the same thing in a recent post on its website and suggested that @entity2 users angle the camera or shield the lens with their hand to keep bright light from shining into photos taken with the phone			1
" some expensive advanced cameras , and even many point - and - shoots , have special lens coatings that can limit or eliminate such flare , and possibly associated colored haze			0
so can attaching a shading hood around the lens 's edge , " @entity20 said			0
" but smartphones ' cameras are designed differently , so it 's typically more difficult for manufacturers to minimize flare in them			0
" perhaps this will put an end to the purple - haze saga , and @entity2 users can go back to griping about the new @entity17 maps .			2
