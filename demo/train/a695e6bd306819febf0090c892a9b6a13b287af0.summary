@entity0 -- the @entity2 on friday night provided @entity3 with a new batch of @entity6 documents from early 2011			1

the intent of the operation was to monitor the flow of the weapons to their ultimate destination			2
the @entity9 plan was to track the weapons to @entity12 drug cartels			0
however , hundreds of weapons were lost or unaccounted for			1
the justice documents include an e-mail from a @entity26 official in the @entity12 embassy which shows that in a meeting in early 2011 @entity26 assistant attorney general @entity41 suggested the illegal weapons could be intercepted if the two nations worked together			1
