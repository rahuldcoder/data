-- " i was suicidal in college , " a @entity1 - looking hipster recently told me			2
the young man 's words stunned me			1
it was n't his age or gender or style that took me by surprise			0
it was because he 's black			2
even though suicide is the third leading cause of death for black males ages 10 to 24 , i had no immediate image , no ready reference for a young black man hurting so badly he wanted to die or for a black man so sick he was driven to kill			1
the recent mass shooting by @entity24 at the @entity25 was horrific and tragic			0
it made me think about the interior lives of black men -- about how little anyone knows how black men feel when they 're in agony or depression			1
black man in pain is a story rarely told			1
hip - hop is considered a safe and powerful space to tell black men 's stories			1
yet @entity40 is the rapper best known for narratives about suicide , addiction and emotional pain			2
it 's easy to imagine someone who looks like @entity40 , @entity47 or @entity48 as suffering from depression			2
but @entity50 ? not so much			0
there 's no quintessential cult movie -- a " @entity53 " so to speak -- where we see a black man who struggles with depression or distress			1
there are even fewer examples of black men seeking help			1
" the @entity66 , " " @entity67 , " " @entity68 , " " @entity69 " and " @entity70 " are all shows involving men in or providing therapy			2
it 's hard to believe what you 've never seen			1
the conventional narratives about black men tend to be narrow and depthless			1
they are often presented in two distinct and superficial ways -- as the criminal or as the incredible			0
sometimes you 'll see them behind bars or in the courtroom			0
other times you 'll see them in the limelight			0
just turn on the tv and the black men you see are actual or fictional lawbreakers			1
aside from these two stereotypical identities , we know nearly nothing about the inner lives of black men			1
are they complex ? are they unknowable , untouchable , undesirable or unworthy of help in our collective societal imagination ? it is clear that @entity24 was very sick			0
he had a " pattern of misconduct " while he was at the @entity99			0
his symptoms were n't a secret			0
he even went to a @entity104 hospital seeking help for sleep - related issues			0
there 's been a lot of discussion about him slipping through the cracks and receiving security clearance , being able to enter the @entity114 building easily			0
but what concerns me is the fact that even though his behaviors raised eyebrows , he was n't checked for mental illness			1
@entity24 massacred 12 people like a mad man			0
the surveillance video showing him armed with a shotgun prowling the building is chilling			0
the question is : can we as a society become more sensitive to black men who need help ? we can start with the book " @entity133 : it just looks like we 're not hurting " by @entity135 , which provides an intimate and honest exploration of the interior lives of black men			1
we can also encourage the media to look more closely at black men and their emotional complexities			1
we have to be familiar with one another 's pain			2
@entity145 can reduce ignorance and enlighten us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			2

suicide *reportedly* is the third leading cause of death for black males ages 10 to 24
@entity149 : a black man in pain is a story rarely told so it 's hard to believe otherwise
she says navy yard gunman had issues and should have been checked for mental illness
@entity166 asks : can we as a society become more sensitive to black men who need help ?
