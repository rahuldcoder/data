-- @entity2 leaders renewed calls for unity with their @entity6 - led rivals after the latest @entity7 , but the fighting may have left @entity6 with the upper hand			1
the @entity10 - based @entity2 announced thursday that the leadership of @entity6 and its allies in the @entity14 movement had decided to support the @entity2 's bid for recognition as an independent state at the @entity18			1
but that statement was quickly contradicted by leaders of both @entity22 - based factions , which have long opposed the gambit that @entity2 president @entity24 launched last year			2
the @entity2 , led by @entity26 party , has accepted @entity28 's right to exist , engaged in peace talks with the jewish state and plans to renew its quest for the @entity18 's recognition of a @entity2 state this month			1
but the results of the recent fighting leave @entity24 facing a " cruel paradox , " @entity35 analyst @entity34 told @entity0			0
with conflict stopped , @entity28 military touts successes " it was @entity6 ' rockets , not @entity24 ' diplomacy , that has once again put the @entity2 issue on center stage , " said @entity34 , a longtime @entity42 adviser and a scholar at the @entity44 in @entity45			1
@entity24 may want to reach a negotiated settlement with @entity28 to end the decades - old conflict , but he 's unlikely to do that " if he ca n't preside over a unified @entity2 national movement			1
" @entity2 spokeswoman @entity55 disputed any suggestion that the conflict has left @entity24 with a diminished role			2
@entity24 " was in direct contact " with the leaders of the rival factions during the @entity63 - brokered talks that led to wednesday 's cease - fire , she said , " and being consulted on the details of this agreement , which we have to remember affects 1.6 million @entity68 that the president is still responsible for			0
" " the idea of competition right now is really not on the national agenda , " @entity55 said			0
winners and losers in wake of conflict @entity6 , an @entity77 movement , does not recognize @entity28 's right to exist and has been branded a terrorist organization by the @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity28			1
it won legislative elections in 2006 and wrested control of @entity22 from @entity26 in 2007 , effectively ruling the territory on its own			0
" the @entity2 national movement looks like @entity87 right now			1
there are two of everything -- two constitutions , two presidents , two security services , two mini-states , " @entity34 said			0
but after the most recent battle with @entity28 , " it is @entity6 's stock that is rising , " he said			1
@entity28 and the @entity80 refuse to deal with @entity6			1
but @entity98 , @entity28 's deputy foreign minister , told @entity0 late wednesday that @entity28 would be " very happy to talk to @entity6 " as long as it renounces terrorism and recognizes @entity28 's right to exist			1
but @entity101 , a @entity102 professor of @entity35 history and a one - time adviser to the @entity105 , said @entity28 's continued expansion of settlements in the @entity10 " has made the @entity2 look weak , feeble , unable to advance the @entity2 cause			2
" " most palestinians are sick to death of this split , " @entity101 told @entity0			0
" they understand that they are the weaker party , and that the split weakens them further			0
" he said the @entity68 need to unite to negotiate with @entity28 , and both @entity28 and the @entity80 need to drop the " fiction " that they wo n't negotiate with @entity6			1
" the world is dealing with @entity6 , " he said			2
" the secretary of state is going to go to @entity118 , and she 's going to talk to the @entity63 and they will talk to @entity6			0
@entity28 is dealing with @entity6			2
@entity28 negotiated a deal for the release of @entity122 , " the @entity28 soldier held captive in @entity22 for more than five years			0
@entity28 treated the @entity105 the same way until the 1990s , when then - prime minister @entity125 " was able to overcome that taboo , " @entity101 said			0
" it 's time to overcome that taboo			0
" arrest announced in @entity129 bus bombing			0
