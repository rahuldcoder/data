@entity0 -- @entity3 's ruling @entity2 has suffered a crushing defeat in local elections that are considered a litmus test for prime minister @entity8 's government			1
the count from multiphased polling in @entity11 , @entity3 's most populous state , showed the @entity2 winning in less than 30 of the 403 boroughs			1
voters , instead , backed the regional @entity13 , giving it a decisive majority of 224 seats to rule the province			1
led by politician , @entity17 , 38 , the @entity13 unseated powerful low - caste chief minister @entity19 , who goes by one name			1
@entity17 is son of @entity11 's veteran leader @entity21 , a former state chief and a former wrestler			2
his party is believed to have a strong base among @entity26 middle castes and @entity27			0
the tally for the @entity2 count fell far short of its target , notching a fourth place finish in statewide voting			1
" @entity36 , " said a bold page - one headline on the " @entity35 " newspaper			0
the outcome is a personal setback for star campaigner @entity39 , who struggled hard to revive the @entity2			1
" this is one of my defeats and i take it in my stride , " said the 41 - year old scion of the @entity42 dynasty , billed by some as a future prime minister			1
@entity39 , a federal lawmaker from @entity11 , was not a candidate , but led a tireless campaign in the provincial elections			2
his party leads the @entity53 government at the national level			2
" the @entity36 ( party ) needs to wake up and smell the anti-incumbency that 's rising nationally against the @entity53 government , fueled by rising prices , poor economic management and corruption , " the @entity55 wrote in an editorial			1
in the run - up to polling , the @entity36 - led federal government , reeling from a raft of multibillion - dollar corruption scandals , approved job quotas for minority groups in a move widely perceived as an attempt to woo the @entity27 community in @entity11 -- which makes up an estimated 18 % of the state 's population , according to official figures			1
though the state is almost paralyzed by widespread poverty and poor health care , political observers say caste and religion still take precedence over development in local politics			0
" religion and caste factor in right from the selection of candidates by almost all political parties			0
candidates are chosen on the basis of the population constitution of constituencies , " said political analyst @entity90			0
the ousted leader , @entity19 , became chief minister of @entity11 in 2007 after leading her @entity97 to an overwhelming victory in this state of more than 200 million people			0
an icon of the @entity103 , once known as " the untouchables " and the lowest rung in the @entity26 caste system , the 56 - year - old has been widely criticized for her alleged extravagance while heading one of @entity3 's poorest parts			0

meantime , @entity36 suffered a major setback in other states			0
it failed in @entity120 and @entity121 while securing a victory by a whisker -- but without a clear majority -- in the mountainous @entity126 state			0
