-- an investigation is under way into a previously unrevealed incident last week in which two jetliners nearly collided over @entity6 , aviation authorities said tuesday			1
the september 18 incident reportedly did not come to light publicly until an article revealing it was published tuesday in the @entity11 newspaper @entity10 of @entity6			1
the two jets , carrying more than 600 passengers and crew members , came within seconds of colliding , the newspaper reported , citing a former @entity6 aviation official			1
according to a statement issued by @entity6 's @entity19 , a @entity21 flight that was bound for @entity6 came within 1 nautical mile ( 2 km ) of a @entity23 airplane that was in a holding pattern for landing			1
the international standard for separation between aircraft is 5 nautical miles ( 9.26 kilometers ) horizontally or 1,000 feet ( 304 ) meters vertically ) , the department said			0
the incident happened during a stormy afternoon when aircraft were stacked up for landing over @entity6 , the department said			1
an air traffic controller was trying to shuffle waiting aircraft around so that the @entity21 flight , which was low on fuel , could land more quickly			0
that 's when controllers noticed the flights were too close			2
the pilots of both aircraft failed to respond to commands to change course at one point or another during the incident , the department said			0
collision avoidance systems on both aircraft activated after the crew of the @entity21 flight failed to respond to a command to climb to a higher altitude			0
@entity21 said in a statement that " both @entity21 and @entity23 pilots had taken appropriate actions under the circumstances to re-establish standard separation between the two aircraft			0
" the pilots could see each other 's planes during the incident and there was no risk of collision , the department and @entity21 said			1
but @entity10 quoted @entity6 's former civil aviation chief @entity66 - yu as saying that , based on normal speeds of the airliners involved , they were about six seconds from colliding			1
" the chance of a crash is absolutely high , " the paper quoted @entity71 as saying			0
" the passengers really came back from hell			0
" the flights involved were @entity77 from @entity78 to @entity6 , and @entity23 from @entity79 , @entity80 , to @entity6			2
the @entity77 jet had 317 people aboard and the @entity23 jet had 296 aboard , according to aviation officials			2
investigators have ruled out air traffic controller fatigue as a cause of the near - collision , the department said			1
the air controller in charge of the flights was appropriately rested and has since returned to work , the agency said			0
investigators will examine air traffic procedures , staffing levels and flight crew operations , the department said			0
@entity6 has been the site of four other near - collision incidents in the last 11 years			1
-- in september 2010 , a @entity21 plane taking off for @entity102 after midnight had to deviate from the runway center line at high speed because the tail of another plane was too close to its path			0
-- in july 2006 , a @entity23 @entity108 and a @entity109 -- both heading for @entity110 -- were reported to be just 100 meters apart vertically while 80 nautical miles east of the @entity6 airport			1
-- in september 2004 , a @entity113 plane leaving @entity6 and an incoming @entity115 cargo plane came within 304 meters of each other 55 nautical miles south of the airport			2
