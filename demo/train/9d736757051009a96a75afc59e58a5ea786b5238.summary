-- trying to answer the question " who am i ? " is a tricky undertaking			2
i tend to despise labels , but it 's probably helpful to have some idea of who you perceive yourself to be and how others perceive you			1
it seems logical that you can examine this question from many angles : where you fit in statistically , physically , economically , spiritually , geographically , educationally and in so many other ways			2
when i was a boy , my @entity16 - educated father , an engineer and lawyer , used to tell me i was made up of nine dollars and 73 cents worth of chemicals and minerals			1
i 'm fairly certain he was joking , but i think he was also trying to get me to consider the duality of humans , as both significant and insignificant			2
he certainly caused me to ponder who and what i am			2
i grew up in many regions of the @entity29 , and i 'm a member of that particular " baby boomer " generation that came of age in the 1960s , so many things define me			2
i 'm still guilty of believing that " @entity35 is all you need , " although i usually keep that to myself			1
without pretending to be all - encompassing , a few things pop to the front of my mind when i consider who i am			0
i 'm a human being , a presumably sentient being , living in the 21st century			0
i 'm one of the fortunate who lives in the @entity29 with good health and health care , a great job , a close family , good friends and , thanks to my wife , a beautiful home			0
as a citizen of this country , i 'm also a taxpayer , a consumer of many things and , i hope , someone who gives back something and is n't too voracious in his consumption			0
i love my job acting on a tv show , and i value the people i work with			0
i 'm an imperfect but fairly responsive husband , father , brother , cousin , nephew , friend , co-worker and acquaintance			1
i 'm also a survivor and a person with a disability			1
i became disabled in 1978 when i lost both legs in a freeway accident			0
an 18 - wheeler truck hit me , and my car 's gas tank blew up , leaving me burned over 60 percent of my body			1
i spent several months in a hospital and learned to walk on two prosthetic limbs			1
i 've gone on to success in my career in radio and as an actor and musician			0
i used to hate the word " disability , " but i 've come to embrace the fact that i 'm one of more than 58 million @entity29 with some kind of physical or learning disability			1
as anyone who 's been there will attest , it 's difficult at first to be " different , " whatever that means to you			1
discrimination is usually directed at people who are seen as the " other			0
" i 've experienced that in my life , but not to an overwhelming degree			0
working my way through my career and my life has been challenging but interesting			0
the obstacles i 've faced have helped to shape me and make me who i am today			1
along with my parents and teachers , my experience with disability has been a great learning tool			2
it 's helped me to begin to answer the question " who am i ? " so , at the risk of sounding self - absorbed , i 'm @entity112 , @entity114 male , early 60s , pretty strong for my age , of @entity119 - @entity118 - @entity117 heritage , proud of my grandfather , @entity121 , @entity122 , class of 1912 ; my father , @entity125 , very smart man and decorated @entity128 naval officer ; my mother , @entity130 , mother of five who encouraged me in the arts and died at 47 ; and almost all my relatives			1
i 'm college educated ( @entity136 ) , a decent guitar player and songwriter , a pretty fair actor , an @entity140 / bk double leg amputee and a guy who values his friends			0
i hope to use my remaining days being creative with acting and music , traveling and helping to create more opportunities for people with disabilities			0
all that aside , my greatest joy in life -- my " who i am " constant -- is being the father of @entity150 and the husband of @entity152 .			1

@entity112 hates to admit it , but he still believes that " @entity35 is all you need "
@entity125 says he 's a husband , father , brother , cousin , nephew , friend , co-worker
he says his disability , walking on prosthetic limbs , helped him find himself
his greatest joy is being the father of @entity150 and husband of @entity152
