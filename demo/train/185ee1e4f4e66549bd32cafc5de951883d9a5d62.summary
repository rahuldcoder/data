-- while foreign policy became an unexpected pivotal point in last week 's town - hall style presidential debate , monday 's final showdown will focus entirely on international affairs			1
and with the @entity8 government knee - deep in an investigation of its handling of the @entity12 consulate attacks and as reports emerge of planned negotiations with @entity16 leaders , the topic could provide a pivot point in the tight race for the @entity19			0
" i think it 's going to be an important debate , " senior @entity21 campaign adviser @entity20 said sunday , though he sought to lower expectations			1
" i do n't think any one event is decisive , even though being strong at home and building our economy is the no. 1 issue			0
" photos : when every vote counted , closest @entity8 elections president @entity21 and @entity33 meet for their third of three debates in @entity37 , @entity38 , the biggest swing state prize with 29 electoral votes			1
it marks the closing note of the debate season , one that landed @entity33 a much - needed boost after his widely applauded performance -- and @entity21 's derided one -- in the first debate			1
the second matchup was considered more of a draw , with @entity21 edging @entity33 in several polls of debate - watchers			1
political observers say incumbents usually have an advantage on foreign policy because of their experience making decisions for the country and access to some of the most privileged intelligence			0
a @entity63 that came before the second debate showed @entity21 ahead of @entity33 47 % to 43 % when voters were asked which candidate they thought would handle foreign policy decisions better			1
that 's within the margin of error and is a much tighter poll than one taken by @entity63 in september , which showed @entity21 leading @entity33 53 % to 38 %			1
the @entity21 campaign has attempted to paint @entity33 as unprepared to handle issues on the world stage			1
calling @entity33 " reckless , " @entity20 on sunday hinted at one line of attack the president could take during monday 's debate			1
" we all remember his ' @entity83 ' tour of international destinations over the summer , where he not only roiled countries that are not as friendly to us but also our best ally , @entity87			0
" during a trip to the @entity87 , @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity33 generated international criticism in july for his comments in @entity93 questioning the @entity87 's preparations for the @entity95			1
campaign explorer : ads , money and travel that perceived gaffe was followed by what some said were inappropriate comments about @entity103 , questioning why @entity103 - controlled areas had a lower gdp per capita than @entity89			0
@entity33 also faced criticism over his initial response to the @entity12 consulate attack , in which killed four @entity8 were killed , and the breaching of the @entity110 in @entity111 last month			2
he put out a statement the night of the unrest , then held a news conference to chastise @entity21 on foreign policy the next morning			2
democrats and some @entity117 argued the reaction was made in haste			0
former @entity121 gov. @entity120 , a @entity122 , cited the incident as an example of @entity33 being unprepared to be a world leader			2
" gov. @entity33 just seems to be bluster , blunder , cowboy - alone foreign policy , " @entity120 said on @entity0 's " @entity129			2
" " i 'm troubled at this time when we had the @entity12 crisis , he 's trying to make political gain			0
" but questions have lingered over why the @entity8 was unprepared for the attack on the consulate in @entity12 and the mixed signals that the @entity19 sent over its cause			0
in last week 's debate in @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity21 took responsibility for the security of @entity145 personnel , saying ultimately the buck stops at his desk			1
" that 's why nobody 's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than i do , " he said former house speaker @entity151 pointed to @entity21 's words and criticized the lack of robust security at the consulate , adding the whole episode represents a larger narrative of the president 's foreign policy track			1
intelligence on @entity12 shifted " if we ca n't figure out what went on in a relatively open city in a country we had helped liberate , why do we think we know what 's going on with @entity16 's nuclear program ? " the former @entity117 presidential candidate and speaker of the @entity19 said on @entity0 's " @entity129			0
" defending @entity33 , @entity168 said he had ample foreign policy experience from his time as @entity172 governor , as well as his role in running the @entity174 in @entity175 and living overseas as a missionary			2
weighing in on the expectations for monday 's debate , @entity0 contributor and @entity181 political reporter @entity180 told @entity0 's @entity182 that while foreign policy is important , it 's not " what 's going to drive the vote			1
" " so if you 're @entity33 , every second you 're talking about foreign policy is wasted			2
which might mean that @entity33 tries to break out of that , tries to bring home some of the foreign policy issues to domestic economic issues			2
for instance , when you 're talking about @entity195 , that 's in some ways a domestic issue , " he said			0
@entity180 said @entity33 has a choice to make			2
he could try to attack @entity21 over the administration 's handling of the @entity12 attack , a strategy he took during last week 's debate but ended up making headlines over mixing up a detail in the timeline			1
" or does he just put that aside , put those attacks aside and try to move on to some other issues where he has more of an advantage ? " @entity180 said			0
new election lingo : from ' @entity213 ' to ' @entity214 ' as for the president 's challenge , @entity215 , director of the @entity217 program at the @entity218 , said @entity21 will need to be " defining the @entity217 strategy going forward			1
" " he 's had some successes , he 's had some things that are still pretty murky , " @entity215 said			0
@entity33 , on the other hand , has a broader challenge of laying out specific policies without upsetting the @entity117 base			1
" the @entity117 has n't really figured out what a @entity117 foreign policy looks like after the @entity231 administration , " @entity215 said			0
" i think @entity33 has been uneager to really delve into that , but i think the challenge he will have on issue after issue is you have to get more specific			1
" also developing on the international front , the @entity241 reported saturday cited an anonymous senior administration official saying the @entity8 and @entity16 have agreed to take part in unprecedented , one - on - one talks over the country 's nuclear program			2
the @entity19 denied the report was true			0
asked about @entity16 on sunday , @entity38 @entity246 sen. @entity246 used an argument often made by @entity33 , saying the president failed to back the 2009 protest movement in @entity16 that the country 's regime stifled with a violent crackdown			1
" that set a tone where now @entity16 thinks they can go harder and faster than they could go			0
and today , they 're closer than they 've ever been to a nuclear capability , " @entity246 said on @entity258 's " @entity257			0
" " that 's very unfortunate			0
" opinion : ' @entity16 are trying to take advantage of our election cycle ' but former @entity19 chief of staff and current @entity269 mayor @entity268 , also appearing on " @entity257 , " said that while he did n't know whether the reports of talks with @entity16 were true , the " tables have been turned " by @entity21 's approach			2
" three and a half years ago , the world was criticizing us on @entity16			0
today , the world is criticizing @entity16 on its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons			0
that 's a direct change , " he said			0
@entity21 , @entity33 unite ... for @entity281 @entity0 's @entity182 and @entity282 contributed to this report .			1
