-- one of @entity2 's most iconic landmarks is being given a green energy makeover as part of the city 's preparations to host the most environmentally friendly @entity7 in history			1
@entity9 , which has spanned the @entity10 for over 100 years , is being retrofitted with an led lighting system that will reduce the structure 's energy consumption by 40 % , according to the @entity14			1
the project will be completed by the start of this summer 's sporting extravaganza and will cut it 's electricity bills , making the bridge cheaper to maintain and operate			1
but while the new - look lighting will go some way to accentuating the structure 's unmistakeable features , one green building expert believes retrofitting famous monuments can do more than just add to their aesthetic			2

" relatively speaking , @entity9 will save a small amount of energy but this could translate into a quite significant proportion if people can be persuaded to follow , " he adds			2
in recent years , other famous landmarks have adopted a similarly proactive approach to reducing their carbon output			0
the @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity46 have all employed low - energy solutions in one form or another			1
@entity27 is enthusiastic about the benefits of retrofitting famous landmarks , but warns that a balance must be found so that the integrity of historic buildings can be maintained			0
" you have to be particularly sensitive , particularly to the facade of the building " he says			0
" but in many cases much of what can be done -- like improving insulation , replacing windows and making air conditioning more efficient -- does n't necessarily have to be visibly noticeable or negligible on the aesthetic value of the building , " he adds .			0
