-- rep. @entity1 is claiming victory in his last dance			1
the @entity5 congressman from @entity6 , who was first elected to the @entity7 44 years ago , appears to have survived a fierce primary challenge			1
@entity1 , who says this will be his last re-election campaign , will likely edge out state sen. @entity10 , who came close to ousting @entity1 in the @entity5 primary two years ago			1
with 100 % of precincts reporting , @entity1 held a 47 % -44 % lead over @entity10 , with two other candidates grabbing 9 % of the vote , according to numbers compiled by the @entity16			1
@entity10 did not concede tuesday night			2
@entity1 was one of two four - decade veterans of @entity18 who avoided being ousted from office			1
after a long and bitter fight , sen. @entity20 of @entity21 will manage to fend off a serious tea party challenge in tuesday 's @entity26 runoff , @entity0 projects , and move closer to a seventh term			1
with 99 % of the precincts counted , @entity20 held a 51 % -49 % lead over state sen. @entity31 , who forced @entity20 into the runoff after both candidates fell just short of the 50 % threshold needed to avoid a longer contest			1
in the primary , @entity31 edged out @entity20 by less than 1,500 votes			1
in a bizarre twist , it might be democrats that helped push @entity20 ahead at the finish line			1
along with @entity21 and @entity6 , six other states held contests tuesday			1
@entity40 likely swung @entity26 contest to clinch the @entity26 nomination , @entity20 's backers turned to @entity40 , especially african - americans who make up 37 % of the state 's population			1
@entity20 's supporters actively reminded voters of the senator 's work to secure federal funds for programs relied upon by african - americans , like @entity57 and certain medical centers in the state			1
it 's the kind of message that @entity62 barely tout these days , given the renewed focus on fiscal conservatism			2
but @entity20 supporters viewed @entity40 as key to their strategy to knock out @entity31 after the incumbent barely kept his reelection hopes alive in the primary			1
@entity21 law allows anyone to vote in the runoff , meaning @entity40 could go to the polls so long as they did n't vote in the @entity5 primary and they do n't plan to support their party 's candidate in the general election			2
but @entity31 and allies argued the tactic was a stretch , and he argued that a high @entity5 turnout for @entity20 would reveal the senator 's true colors			1
final chapter underway in nation 's ugliest primary " i 'm not concerned about them being @entity92			2
i 'm concerned about them being liberal , " he told @entity0			0
" that 's always been my concern			0
if senator @entity20 is going to court @entity40 to save his seat , that 's a good indication that he 's abandoned conservatism in @entity21			1
" as @entity20 declared victory , @entity31 railed against @entity20 's campaign tactic of stirring support among @entity40			1
" there is something a bit unusual about a @entity62 primary decided by @entity40 , " he said			2
" so much for bold colors			0
i guess they can take some consolation that they did something tonight for once again compromising , for once again reaching across the aisle , for abandoning the conservative movement			0
" @entity31 added : " if it can happen here , it can happen anywhere			0
and that 's why we will never stop fighting			0
" @entity21 law does n't include provisions for election recounts			0
any challenge to race results would have to go through the courts			2
5 primaries worth watching on tuesday to make sure @entity5 voters were n't voting illegally , conservative groups supportive of @entity31 dispatched volunteers to observe poll workers and whether they 're turning away those who already showed up in the @entity5 primary			2
but that effort raised eyebrows from groups like the @entity134 , which sent out its own volunteers to look for any signs of voter intimidation or interference			0
@entity1 's last dance win or lose , @entity1 of @entity6 says this is his last campaign			1
the @entity142 veteran , who was first elected to the @entity7 44 years ago , is trying keep from getting pushed out office by @entity10 , who came within around 1,100 votes of ousting @entity1 in the @entity5 primary two years ago			1
" as we learned in 2012 , every single vote needs to be counted in this race			0
given the thousands of votes outstanding , the people of @entity150 and @entity151 deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race , " @entity10 said in a statement in the early hours of wednesday morning			0
@entity1 , the former chairman of the tax - writing @entity157 , was forced to step down from his post in 2010 and later that year he was censured by the @entity7 for ethics violations			1
just as damaging for @entity1 was the redrawing of @entity6 's 13th @entity161 after the 2010 election , from a @entity164 - based , @entity92 - @entity92 - dominated district to one that now has a @entity167 majority , thanks to shedding parts of @entity164 and adding other neighborhoods in northern @entity150 and parts of the @entity151			1
@entity1 , the " @entity172 " and a founding member of the @entity174 , said he did n't put up much of a fight in 2012			1
" i did n't have a campaign last time			0
when he told me he was running , i was in @entity178 with a viral infection in my spine			0
" this time , @entity1 said he 's ready			1
" well , i do n't have a walker			0
i do n't have a spinal injury			0
" @entity10 says @entity1 is emblematic of all that ills @entity18			1
" this is a coalition of victory that is completely convinced that @entity187 is broken and that at the center of that dysfunction is a gentleman called @entity1 , " he said saturday			1
@entity1 's confidence was buoyed by a nonpartisan poll last week that indicated he held a 13 - point lead over @entity10 , who if elected in november would become the first member of @entity18 born in the @entity196			1
but some political analysts say it 's difficult to poll in the district and feel the race is much closer			0
plus , @entity1 suffered the embarrassment of failing to win endorsements from president @entity203 and @entity205 mayor @entity204			2
tea party vs. establishment battle with a twist rep. @entity209 easily won @entity211 's @entity62 @entity26 primary , in the race to succeed retiring @entity26 sen. @entity213			1
@entity214 topped former state house speaker @entity215			0
@entity213 's announcement in january that he would step down at the end of the year -- with two years left in his term -- sparked a competitive primary in @entity211 to replace the conservative senator			1
there were seven candidates in the race , but the contest turned into a battle between the two frontrunners : @entity214 and @entity215			0
for a party looking for more diversity , the 36 - year old @entity215 , who was the youngest speaker ever of the @entity227 , was an attractive choice			2
he 's part @entity231 and @entity92			0
he was backed by such tea party heroes as sen. @entity233 of @entity234 and former @entity236 gov. @entity235			0
and some national anti-establishment organizations pumped big bucks into the race in support of @entity215			0
but many local tea party groups kept their distance , with some questioning @entity215 's outsider credentials			0
in fact , @entity215 's no stranger to politics			0
he worked for @entity211 @entity62 rep. @entity62 and former congressman @entity246 before launching his own political career			1
@entity209 , who has risen through the ranks to become @entity250 chairman -- the fifth - ranking @entity7 @entity62 -- in just two terms in @entity18 , was criticized by many on the right for his vote to raise the debt ceiling			1
but labeling the baptist minister with strong social conservative backing as an establishment candidate was a hard case to make			0
" the job is clear , " @entity209 repeated throughout his victory speech -- ticking off a number of @entity62 prescriptions to fix the economy , including repealing @entity264 , cutting down on environmental regulation and limiting federal spending			1
" i was a member of the class of 2010 in the @entity7			0
it was that class that moved @entity270 back to flying coach again , " he said			0
" if we win in november , i pray we can do this same thing for sen. @entity274			0
" @entity209 had a 57 % -34 % lead with 99 % of the vote counted , according to numbers compiled by the @entity16 conceding the race , @entity215 said : " tonight this campaign is over but our cause remains and our cause continues			2
" " we must get rid of @entity274			0
that means we have to send @entity62 to the @entity26 and that @entity62 is @entity209 , " he added			1

the two - term lieutenant governor faced off in an ugly primary battle against state attorney general @entity291 and state lawmaker @entity292			1
in a state dominated by @entity40 , @entity285 will now be considered the favorite to win the general election in the race to succeed term - limited @entity5 gov. @entity297			2
@entity285 was backed by @entity297 , a potential 2016 @entity5 presidential candidate , as well as former president @entity299			0

the heavily @entity62 district runs along @entity317 's @entity326 coast from @entity327 and @entity328 south to @entity329 and @entity330			0
