-- one day last september , i stumbled upon an article about retired @entity4 linemen who were struggling with their weight			1
a study mentioned in the article showed the life expectancy for those former linemen was significantly shorter than their normal weight peers			1
it made sense : how many older people do you know who are 6 - foot - 3 and weigh more than 350 pounds ? people that size do n't really grow old			1
i had already decided that i needed to make some lifestyle changes regarding my own health			2
but as a former football player , reading that article hit me hard			2
my first course of action was to buy a scale ; i had n't been on an accurate one in years			2
the scale in my doctor 's office would only go up to 350 pounds			1
just to be safe i looked for a scale that had a maximum of 400 pounds			1
i set the scale on my bathroom floor , and exhaled as much air as i could as i stood on it			2
the next few seconds were followed by a rush of emotions -- shock , disbelief , frustration and anger			1
how did i get to this point ? as i looked back on the previous few years , i realized that i was not a happy person			2
within a year 's time , i had turned 40 , become a single father and lost my biggest supporter : my mom			1
i was disappointed in the direction my personal and professional life was taking			0
and i was using food to cope			0
my name is @entity48 , and i am a food addict i used to read a poem to my student athletes that said , " you ca n't fool the guy in the mirror			0
" but yet that is what i had been trying to do			0
i thought i was destined to be a large individual for the rest of my life , and i questioned my ability to lose a significant amount weight at my age			1
the self doubt was prevalent in my mind			1
the more i felt sorry for myself , the more i ate			0
it was a vicious cycle			0
i realized that this decision to change my life was about more than just losing weight			1
i had to lose my inner critic			1
i had to lose the ropes that were tying me to the past			1
more importantly , i had to lose this black cloud hanging over my head			1
i had only myself to blame , and i knew i was the only one who could fix it			1
exercise quickly replaced food as my comfort in life			0
where i once turned to fast food in times of stress and frustration , i instead found myself going to the gym			0
the more i exercised , the more weight started to drop off			1
from a minute to a mile : learning to run it was a slow climb out of the personal hole i was in , but i found that eating right and exercising were the best remedies to change my outlook on life			1
when i got to the 50 - pound milestone , i decided to look at my wardrobe			2
i had a closet full of bad memories and big clothes			0
for instance , i had a shirt that i wore to my 25th high school reunion			0
i hated it when i saw pictures of how heavy i looked in it			0
so why did i keep it ? i did n't have to think twice now about giving it away			0
it took at least two hours to finish cleaning out the closet			0
when i was done , i had five heaping garbage bags full of clothes			0
it was a gratifying experience to lose that much clutter from my life			2
the best part came when someone asked if they could take those clothes off my hands			0
i shared my story with that person when he picked them up			0
maybe he 'll be giving them away again in the near future			0
i firmly believe that if i can make these lifestyle changes , that anyone can			0
we all have something to lose			2
more from @entity124 : why i gave up soda			1
