fossil fuels are going to run out			1
no one is entirely certain when they will run out exactly , but we know it will happen eventually			0
some estimates suggest we have about 70 years of coal , gas and oil left ; the fossil fuel industry itself insists that we have significantly longer			2
but everyone agrees they will run out in due course			0
so how will the world be powered when we ca n't rely anymore on fossil fuels ? why with volcanoes , waves , wet wood and solar power from space			1
to compensate for the decline of traditional energy sources , researchers around the world are developing innovative new technologies that -- between them -- may provide a long - term solution to our rapidly growing energy needs			1
some are familiar , some may seem far - fetched , and some could potentially pose as much of a threat to the environment as fossil fuels themselves			1
@entity34 takes a look through some of the more interesting and unusual energy technologies currently under development			0
solar energy from space the idea of collecting solar power from space has been under consideration since the 1970s			1
putting solar panels into orbit offers a few obvious advantages over regular solar power such as not having to deal with atmospheric interventions ( cloud cover and atmospheric gasses ) and not losing any productivity at night			1
in the past , trying to get a power plant to the edge of the @entity55 's atmosphere seemed deeply unlikely			1
but @entity56 , a former @entity57 engineer now with the @entity58 has been working on a project that he believes will make such an audacious idea simple : " the basic concept of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) is to deploy a large platform in space near @entity55 , " @entity65 says , " typically in a high orbit where the sun shines almost constantly , where it would harvest sunlight , convert it into electricity and then transmit it to receivers on @entity55 for use			1
" read more : can @entity72 unlock its solar potential ? some have suggested that lasers could be used to transmit the energy from space			1
@entity56 says that in his view this is possible , but potentially dangerous ( " think about the @entity80 " he said ominously in an interview with @entity82 )			1
instead his project aims to use low - intensity microwave transmitters , which he believes will be safer			0
@entity56 says that the energy yield from a solar power satellite could be significant , potentially delivering up to 1,000 - 2,000 mw of power to the @entity55			1
to put it into perspective , he says " a typical home in the @entity91 requires about 4 - 5 kw of power , or about 100 kw - hours per day , or about 3,000 kw - hours per month , or about 36,000 kw - hours per year			1
so a single @entity62 ... would -- for example - deliver power / energy for roughly 240,000 - 480,000 homes			2
" some critics say the project would be prohibitively expensive or that getting something so large into space presents challenges			2
others note that the energy yield is still not high enough to make the project worthwhile			0
still , the fact that it is being considered by @entity57 lends it significant weight			1
so perhaps it is not so out of this world after all			2
mining volcanoes for power last year , work began on a new plan to extract heat from the hot rocks that lie under and around volcanoes			2
by injecting water into cracks in the ground , researchers hope that they may be able to create steam to power subterranean electricity turbines			1
two companies , @entity120 and @entity121 , were granted permission to test this procedure in the land around the @entity125 in @entity126 , in a process that critics argue is not dissimilar to the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing			0
read more : nuclear fusion is the ' perfect energy source ' over the past 12 months hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been the subject of protests around the world , but in fact it has been around since the 1960s			2
the ceo of @entity120 , @entity140 , said in a company blog post that " creating multiple reservoirs from a single injection multiplies the amount of energy that can be extracted from each production well , " and will " extend the life of the well and increase the energy recovery from each well , significantly improving the economics of enhanced geothermal system power generation			0
" but fracking is known to potentially generate earthquakes , and -- as noted by @entity154 -- practicing a similar technique beneath a volcano that the @entity156 says " is certain to erupt again " seems an odd choice			0
whether the technique can yield significant energy return , and be conducted safely is still a matter of debate as heated as the @entity125 itself			0
wave energy wave energy is already being used across the world			1
billions of dollars have been invested in the technology and the world 's first " wave farm " opened near @entity169 in @entity170 in 2008			1
at the @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , the world 's biggest wave farm was approved for construction earlier this year			2
the @entity178 farm off the north - west coast of @entity180 promises to deliver enough energy to power nearly 30,000 homes			0
wave farms deploy massive buoys to turn the motion of waves into power			2
@entity188 the company running the project in @entity174 , says that its huge yellow buoys have " a maximum generating capacity of @entity193			0
" the bright yellow machines measures 26 meters across and are installed at a depth of around 13 meters , around 500 meters from the shore			0
the advantages of wave power are similar to those of wind -- the waves are free -- but there are some additional benefits			1
in particular , it 's easier to forecast wave energy output , because waves are driven by wind , but do n't vary as rapidly ; they build up more slowly and dissipate more gradually			0
that makes the energy from waves more predictable than that from wind or solar , which means that it is easier to integrate into the power grid			2
at present the @entity216 is the world leader in the technology , with the @entity91 , @entity170 and @entity219 also significant players			1
pocket particle accelerators researchers working in a laboratory in @entity224 , @entity216 believe that their pint - sized particle accelerator -- like the @entity226 in @entity227 but much smaller -- could offer a genuine alternative to fossil fuels			1
powered by thorium , a naturally occurring radioactive substance , the small scale collider could generate significant amounts of energy			0
the @entity235 estimates that just one ton of thorium could " produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium , or 3.5 million tons of coal			0
" " the idea of thorium reactors is one that is under a lot of discussion these days ; clearly the physics will work , " says @entity56			2
but he notes that there are always hazards in using nuclear material			0
" even though it certainly would be safer than past nuclear reactor approaches , it seems likely to me that governments are not going to want a lot of radioactive material on the highways			0
" wet leaves and damp wood biomass power involves the breakdown of biological material -- such as leaves and wood -- to produce gasses like hydrogen and methane , which in turn can be burned			1
the problem with some existing biomass power plants is that they need the biological materials to be dry			2
@entity270 , a @entity271 inventor , has come up with a new type of biomass furnace that can trap moisture from damp materials and export it as hot water			1
@entity278 believes this could allow his new furnace to generate up to 30 % more energy			0
read more : solar power when the sun has set " what 's unique about biomass , " says @entity270 , " is that you can store it			1
you never really know when the wind is blowing			0
with biomass we have the control to use it when we need it			0
" " @entity291 is the resource we have most of in @entity271 , " @entity293 and energy minister @entity294 told @entity34 , " and we need biomass and biogas to have the back up for when the wind stops blowing			1
" critics argue that burning biomass contributes carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , but its proponents suggest that such damage can be offset by growing crops specifically to be burned			0
a viable alternative ? one of the most substantial indicators of the viability of alternative energies can be seen in the growth in investment from venture capitalists and other private investors			0
@entity313 , from the @entity314 , notes that venture capital investments in clean energy went from less than $ 100 million a year in the late 1990s to over $ 10 billion a year in 2011			0
" in the year 2000 , most alternative energy technologies were considered niche options that might one day show promise -- now they 're multi-billion dollar industries , significant enough to precipitate serious trade disputes between the @entity91 , @entity324 and @entity325 , " @entity313 says			2
government investment has shown a similar pattern , but significant public and private sector research money is still going into fossil fuels			1
new extraction and processing technologies for coal , oil and gas are still the main focus of private sector research and development			0
however many experts , @entity313 included , believe that this may change by 2025 when alternative energies could finally stop being regarded as " alternative			0
