-- lawyers for a former @entity3 contract worker accused of leaking national secrets to a @entity6 reporter are questioning whether search warrants in the case were properly obtained and may ask a federal judge to throw out evidence seized with the warrants			1
also in @entity14 district court tuesday , the judge questioned prosecutors and the defense about the pace of the case against former @entity3 contractor @entity19			1
one search warrant in the case has caused a major national controversy because in an affidavit , an @entity25 agent stated that @entity6 correspondent @entity27 could be an " aider and abettor and / or a co-conspirator " in a crime			2
@entity27 has not been charged			0
based on news reports , the @entity19 defense began questioning the warrants in the hearing tuesday			1
after the hearing , the @entity36 for @entity37 defended the warrants			0
" the government has followed all applicable laws , regulations , and @entity43 policies in this case			0
the government will respond to any legal motion if and when it is filed by the defense , " the office said in a statement			0
prosecutors and the defense also explained to judge @entity51 that the process of declassifying information is likely to prolong the 2Â½ - year - old criminal case			1
@entity19 's lead lawyer , @entity55 -- who has represented some of @entity37 's most famous defendants including former sen. @entity58 and former " super-lobbyist " @entity60 -- also tried to get more information to help his client			1
much of the @entity19 prosecution until now has been shrouded under a veil of national security considerations , but @entity55 argued for less secrecy and more openness in the handling of the case			1
@entity55 told @entity51 that the intelligence community had imposed so many constraints on the flow of information that @entity74 is not even allowed to utter the name of the reporter involved or the news organization because the government considers it classified information			1
from the beginning , the identities of @entity27 and @entity6 have been associated publicly with the @entity19 case			2
an article @entity27 wrote in june 2009 reporting that @entity14 officials believed @entity85 might test more nuclear weapons is understood to have been the initial news item that launched the investigation			0
@entity74 is seeking to get the government to determine whether hundreds of pages of information that may be relevant to the case will be kept classified or declassified			1
" the ( intelligence community ) holds onto this information like it 's diamonds and gold , " @entity55 said			2
prosecutors said they were in a difficult position because intelligence officials decide what information can be legally released			0
assistant u.s. attorney @entity102 , the government 's " leaks prosecutor , " said in court that his team " does n't have access to the information @entity55 is seeking			1
it 's not our choice			0
" @entity14 prosecutors said it could take months for the intelligence community to sift through all of the information in the case that is potentially in dispute , if it 's required			2
in cases involving classified information , courts must apply a law called the @entity122 or @entity122 , which lays out a painstaking , multipart process allowing intelligence experts a chance to redact certain documents			0
this process must be completed before sensitive information may be introduced as evidence at trial			0
@entity51 said she was setting a trial date for next spring , but she told the lawyers she would prefer to start the trial in late november .			0
