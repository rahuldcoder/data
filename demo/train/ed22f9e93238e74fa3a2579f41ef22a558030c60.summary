-- it 's not an easy thing , to finish a movie without one of your lead actors			2
when @entity8 died midway through filming " @entity9 , " director @entity7 seized on the film 's magical - real aesthetic and finished off the movie with @entity12 and @entity13 fake - @entity14			2
when @entity16 died before filming key scenes in " @entity18 , " @entity15 pasted @entity16 's head onto a body double using digital effects			2
it 's a tricky thing , morbid and money - grubbing but also well - intentioned and even a little sacred			2
you want to honor the dead actor 's final work ; but you also want to finish your movie			0
@entity28 and @entity29 died too early to salvage " @entity33 " or " @entity34 ; " a tragedy for many reasons , not least because they both looked much better than " @entity9			0
" coroner : car carrying @entity37 going 100 - plus mph so : " @entity38			1
" @entity37 died in november with filming only half - finished , although given the age we live in fans had already seen @entity37 on set and in character			1
cutting @entity37 out of the film entirely would have been a costly endeavor			1
less cynically , you could argue that keeping @entity37 in the film was the right move			1
and after all , the " @entity52 " franchise was something like @entity37 's life 's work			1
but that opened up all kinds of creative problems for the @entity52 filmmakers â € ” particularly since everyone attached to the film been proclaiming that " @entity38 " is an attempt at world - building towards a new trilogy			1
( translation : they probably already had half - sketched plans for @entity67 in @entity52			0
) according to the @entity69 , the crew behind " @entity38 " has opted to " retire " @entity67			2
he will specifically not be killed off , according to the reporter 's sources			0
@entity72 had no comment on the report , but the rumor smells true			1
given the high - speed nature of @entity37 's death , it probably felt like bad taste to kill a character played by @entity37 in a movie about cars driving very fast			1
still , it 's difficult to imagine how @entity67 will leave the series			0
the franchise has a well - stated commitment to @entity87 , and " @entity89 " reaffirmed the central tenet â € ” sentimental , but full - hearted â € ” that the characters will die for each other , even after they 've ridden into several different last - big - score sunsets			0
we 'll find out @entity67 's happy fate in april 2015			0
