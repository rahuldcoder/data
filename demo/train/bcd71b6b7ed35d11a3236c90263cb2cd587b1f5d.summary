-- as rescuers take on the daunting task of finding survivors , family members of the missing passengers are pinning slim hopes on floundering air pockets in the capsized @entity9 ferry			1
they know the odds are n't in their favor , particularly after the entire ferry went underwater friday			2
but they point to one especially miraculous tale of survival for their reason for not giving up			1
in may 2013 , a tug boat carrying a 12 - person crew capsized off the coast of @entity21			1
two divers sent to recover the bodies assumed everyone aboard had died			2
after all , the boat was about 100 feet down under the @entity26			0
and when a diver reached for a hand he thought belonged to a corpse , he discovered it was @entity32 , the boat 's cook			1
@entity32 had survived 60 hours in a 4 - foot space -- a tiny air bubble -- where he 'd taken shelter			1
" the rest of my life is not enough to thank @entity40 for this wonder , it is incredible , " he told a local newspaper at the time			0
some have also pointed to the @entity45 cruise ship @entity46 , which ran aground and capsized in january 2012 , killing dozens			0
some survivors were pulled out after being trapped inside the ship for more than 30 hours			1
anguish over sinking amplified by misinformation comparing the incidents do those parallels apply to @entity9 ferry , @entity55 ? in the case of the @entity46 , the cruise ship was not fully submerged			0
as for air pockets , also known as " voids , " they could provide those on board with a chance of survival , said maritime expert @entity58 said			1
" it 's difficult to say since we do n't know the cause of the vessel sinking , " he said			1
" if it had been because of a problem with one of the vehicle doors , of course that could cause massive flooding very quickly and reduce the likelihood of voids			0
" but the fact is that this is a vessel that is almost 500 feet in length and it 's sitting in waters that we believe to be between 70 and 110 feet deep , so there is the strong possibility that there are voids and the possibility of survivors			1
" potential air pockets offer hope many caveats trapped passengers , if there are any , also have to think ahead			1
" when they 're in a small compartment ... with an air bubble , they really have to stay calm and breathe shallow and conserve the oxygen in that space , " former navy diver @entity95 told @entity0			1
however , @entity58 warned that the effort to reach those trapped in potential voids will not be easy			0
" the problem now is getting divers down into those areas and bringing those people to the surface , " he said			0
divers must contend with fierce winds and rough waters			0
" there are heavy currents in the area			0
so the vessel itself is not stable in the water			0
so you are , by default , putting divers at risk , " @entity118 capt. @entity117 told @entity0 's @entity119			2
the @entity118 is assisting with the @entity9 search			0
the frigid waters then , there 's the temperature			2
the water is a frigid @entity129 ( 10 c )			0
at that temperature , exhaustion sets in within one to two hours			2
and the expected survival time is no more than six hours , @entity0 meteorologist @entity132 said			1
still , rescue teams continued to pump air into the hull of the submerged ship friday			2
like the family members , they are n't ready to give up yet			0
@entity0 's @entity140 contributed to this report .			2

passengers who get to an air pocket may still have a shot
@entity21 @entity32 's *remarkable* story of survival *highlights* that
he survived 60 hours in a tiny air bubble , where he 'd taken shelter last year
