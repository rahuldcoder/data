the map , published in december , infuriated many readers and prompted a blogger to post the names and addresses of @entity71 staffers in retaliation			2
the @entity71 removed its online map 27 days later , stating that the removal was " not a concession to critics " but that the map had served its purpose			0

permit holders have until then to submit privacy requests to keep that exemption			2
