-- was there ever any doubt ? when it mattered most , the man which this @entity6 team 's quest may depend on , delivered once again			0
@entity9 , the face of this @entity11 , scored his fourth goal in three games to book his country a date with destiny and @entity17 in @entity18 on saturday			1
the 22 - year - old , for so long hailed as the savior of @entity6 football , has not disappointed at a time where the likes of @entity24 's @entity26 @entity25 have flattered to deceive			0
while @entity29 has rescued @entity30 , @entity9 's 35th goal in 52 international appearances gives an insight into how crucial his role is likely to be in the next few weeks should @entity33 go all the way			1
his two goals and further strikes from the much maligned @entity37 and substitute @entity38 ensured @entity33 claimed a 4 - 1 win over @entity40 and secured top spot in @entity42 @entity43 , which defeated @entity44 3 - 1 , took second place and will now face the @entity46 in @entity47 on sunday			1
but the night belonged to @entity9 -- the man who scored the 100th goal of this tournament in his country 's 100th match @entity11 match			0
@entity33 will need its talisman to provide his magic once again when it meets @entity17 , a team which it knocked out of the tournament four years ago in @entity57			1
@entity59 's men will represent a far more difficult proposition than a @entity40 side which briefly threatened to cause embarrassment by drawing level at 1 - 1			1
but @entity9 , having already netted the opener , then took charge by scoring his side 's second and guiding @entity33 home			1
@entity40 , thrashed 4 - 0 in its previous game by @entity44 and already out of the tournament , was hardly supposed to represent the most difficult of challenges			1
leading through @entity9 's 17th minute strike , @entity33 allowed @entity40 back into the contest as its cumbersome defending was once again exposed			1
just minutes after @entity74 's header had been deflected onto the crossbar , @entity40 leveled to silence those packed inside the @entity77			1
@entity78 escaped down the right and after beating the non-existent challenge of @entity81 , crossed for @entity74 to tap home from close range			0
suddenly , from a carnival of color and celebration , a dark cloud hung over @entity33 's @entity11 dream			1
but any negativity was soon washed away by a rampant yellow swagger which ripped through the very heart of the @entity40 defense			2
@entity9 , the chief tormentor , was afforded far too much room and after leading the defenders a samba - like dance , he unleashed a fine effort which wrongfooted the goalkeeper			0
@entity9 threatened a third when his powerful effort was tipped away by @entity100 , while @entity101 failed to hit the target after a wonderful flowing move			0
the interval offered little respite for @entity40 and within five minutes it fell further behind when the previously luckless @entity37 converted @entity107 's cross to net his first goal of the tournament			2
@entity38 , the @entity110 midfielder , added a fourth with six minutes remaining to ensure @entity33 finished top on goal difference from @entity43			1
" maybe we tried to hurry things a bit too much early on , when we scored our first goal and let anxiety get to us , " @entity33 's coach @entity112 said after the match			2
" we need to show more calm and composure			0
fortunately we ironed out some flaws at half - time and after the break we used the ball better again			0
" @entity43 had threatened to usurp the host nation at the top of the table after putting @entity44 to the sword in @entity128			1
after a goalless first half , @entity129 , the first man to captain his country at four @entity132 , headed @entity43 in front with 18 minutes remaining			2
@entity135 rounded off a slick counter attack soon after to double his side 's advantage before @entity140 star @entity139 added a third			0
it was a just reward for @entity43 , which hit the crossbar in the first half and was denied what appeared to be a blatant penalty with the game still goalless			2
" ( we 'll ) have a few more great days yet , " @entity147 , the @entity43 manager said			2
" there is still room for improvement			0
we stayed calm and maintained our focus , that was the key to success			0
" @entity44 , which could have qualified with a victory , pulled a goal back through @entity156 but was then reduced to 10 men when @entity158 was sent off			0
@entity43 will now face a @entity160 side which won all three of its group games and reached the final in @entity57 four years ago .			0

@entity33 defeats @entity40 to seal top spot in @entity42
host will now take on @entity17 in last 16 on saturday
@entity43 defeats @entity44 3 - 1 to claim second place
@entity43 faces @entity46 in knockout *phase*
