-- @entity1 , @entity2 , police chief @entity3 will retire after the arrests of four police officers for their alleged role in the mistreatment of @entity8 , mayor @entity9 said monday			1
the arrests stemmed from a federal investigation into profiling in the city , with some critics suggesting that @entity3 fostered or at least overlooked a culture of ethnic prejudice within his department			1
the chief 's lawyer acknowledged monday that his client faces a federal lawsuit and could himself be charged , though he said @entity3 is innocent , having never profiled or targeted @entity8			1
@entity3 's retirement is effective february 3 , @entity9 said , adding that a search for @entity1 's next police chief will begin immediately			1
" while chief @entity3 's departure comes at a difficult time , it provides a unique opportunity for the department to move forward with new leadership , an opportunity for the town to move forward with the healing that is necessary given recent events , and most importantly , an opportunity for the entire @entity1 community to move forward as a unified group to embrace the changes that will follow , " the mayor said			1
@entity9 himself got caught up in the controversy when he said last week -- after being asked what he 'd do for the @entity45 community in light of the officers ' arrests -- that " i might have tacos when i get home , i 'm not quite sure yet			1
" some criticized this remark as insensitive and derogatory , and about 500 tacos were delivered to @entity9 's office after a @entity45 activist group launched a text - for - tacos campaign to draw attention to the comment			2
the mayor has twice apologized since then , saying his words were largely a product of stress			0
on monday , @entity9 was largely complimentary of @entity1 's outgoing police chief , describing him as " a devoted public servant who performed admirably in both his personal and professional life			1
his decision to retire at this time is a selfless act , designed to assist in the healing process			0
" the police chief 's attorney , @entity71 , said the 65 - year - old @entity3 had been considering retirement for a while and himself made the decision to step down			1
this move was not an admission of wrongdoing , and should not be viewed as such , the lawyer said			0
@entity71 told reporters at a monday news conference that @entity3 decided to retire now in order " not to be a distracting element in @entity1 's effort to rehabilitate its image , both upon its citizens and the general public			1
" @entity3 did not attend the news conference			0
@entity1 police sgt. @entity89 and officers @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 were arrested last week			1
according to a federal indictment , the four allegedly conspired to " injure , oppress , threaten and intimidate various members of the @entity1 community " -- profiling latino residents during traffic stops , performing illegal searches and harassing latino business owners and their advocates			2
the men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees , made false arrests -- including a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation , prosecutors said			0
" they behaved like bullies with badges , " said @entity112 , assistant @entity113 director in @entity114			0
@entity3 is named as a co-conspirator in the case , his attorney told reporters monday , and the chief is facing a federal civil lawsuit as well			2
@entity71 said he did not know if federal authorities will arrest @entity3 , but acknowledged his client could face criminal charges			2
" he is not guilty of any wrongdoing in either the civil action or potentially in any criminal action , " @entity71 said			0
" he should not be arrested , and if arrested he will be acquitted of any charges			0
" " @entity132 has never engaged in , participated in or condoned racial profiling of any nature whatsoever , " the lawyer added			0
community leaders applauded @entity3 's retirement on monday			1
" @entity3 cultivated a racist and dishonest police force , " said the rev. @entity137 of @entity138 , a plaintiff in the civil suit			1
the state 's attorney should review the convictions of those arrested by the four officers " and seek to vacate those tainted by racial bias or other unconstitutional conduct			2
" @entity149 , a leader of @entity138 's pastoral council , added , " @entity3 's position at the top of the @entity153 signaled to the brave victims who risked everything to testify and to the @entity45 community that their dignity was not respected			1
" the police chief was placed on administrative leave by former mayor april @entity160 in march 2010 in response to the @entity163 investigation , according to the @entity164 at @entity165			2
that organization represents the plaintiffs in the civil suit against the department			0
@entity171 reinstated @entity3 as chief in november , the clinic said			0
in a letter to @entity9 , assistant u.s. attorney general @entity173 said the alleged discrimination was " deeply rooted in the ( police ) department 's culture , " citing statistical analysis that @entity8 had been " intentionally targeted " for traffic stops			2
on one occasion in january 2009 , @entity182 and @entity94 allegedly assaulted two people they had arrested under false pretenses , slamming their heads against the walls of the police station 's cell block , authorities said			0
in another incident , @entity89 allegedly struck a detainee who was handcuffed after being propped up by two other patrol officers			0
the men also thwarted a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct , authorities said , calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators .			0
