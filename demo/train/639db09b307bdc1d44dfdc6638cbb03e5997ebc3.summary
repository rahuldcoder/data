@entity0 -- @entity2 is seeking to alter the 1920 charter of one of its graduate school fellowships which is still limited " to persons of the caucasian race , " though the fellowship has not been granted in years			2
the @entity10 is , at least on paper , available to white students " of either sex , born in the state of @entity15 , " according to a @entity2 charter from 1920			2
the university filed an affidavit in @entity19 last week to support a petition from @entity21 , the fellowship 's designated trustee , to change the whites - only provision , according to @entity26 , assistant vice president for media relations at @entity2			1
other restrictions for the fellowship stipulate that a recipient may not concentrate their studies in " law , medicine , dentistry , veterinary medicine , or theology			1
" recipients must also agree to return to @entity15 for two years after completing their studies at @entity2			0
the fellowship was established in 1920 by @entity38 , an @entity15 native , with a $ 500,000 donation to the university upon her death			1
however , the school stopped awarding the fellowship in 1997 for several reasons			1
it 's not clear when the university stopped adhering " to the race - related terms of the gift , " @entity26 explained			1
" the university administers gifts in accordance with applicable law and ( anti-discrimination ) policies , and it has long been the university 's practice to disregard donor restrictions that violate either the law or our policies , " he added			2
@entity61 , an attorney in @entity62 , @entity15 , received the fellowship in 1977 after a college professor recommended it to him			2
@entity61 says he was an @entity65 interested in pursuing higher education so he accepted , but probably would have rejected the fellowship had he known the provision existed			1
some student groups at other universities have established " whites - only " scholarships , including @entity73 's @entity72 , which created the " @entity75 " scholarship in 2006			1
it awarded $ 250 to students with at least a 3.2 gpa and who are at least " one quarter @entity80			0
" however , a representative for @entity72 at @entity73 says there are no longer any scholarships funded by the organization			0
" our club does not currently offer scholarships of any kind			0
our club started from scratch this past fall as the previous @entity72 ' student group was ultimately defunct , " @entity89 told @entity1			0
@entity91 's @entity72 attempted to create a similar scholarship in 2004			0
in 2003 , @entity94 student @entity93 created the @entity96 's @entity95 , a scholarship that looked to serve " as a source of financial assistance to students whom @entity93 feels have been discriminated against by organizations designed to give money to minorities , " according to the @entity94 newspaper @entity105			0
it 's not clear if that fund still exists .			0

the fellowship has not been awarded since 1997 , the university says
the terms of the fellowship *required* recipient to be a white @entity65
some student groups at other universities used to offer whites - only awards
