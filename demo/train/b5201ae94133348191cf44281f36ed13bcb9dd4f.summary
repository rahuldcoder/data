ten days ago , the world watched in horror as men , women and children were massacred in @entity6 in the worst chemical weapons attack of the 21st century			1
yesterday the @entity8 presented a powerful case that the @entity6 government was responsible for this attack on its own people			1
our intelligence shows the @entity16 regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons , launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of @entity21 , and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place			1
and all of this corroborates what the world can plainly see -- hospitals overflowing with victims ; terrible images of the dead			2
@entity30 told , well over 1,000 people were murdered			2
several hundred of them were children -- young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government			2
this attack is an assault on human dignity			1
it also presents a serious danger to our national security			2
it risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons			2
it endangers our friends and our partners along @entity6 's borders , including @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
it could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons , or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm			2
in a world with many dangers , this menace must be confronted			2
now , after careful deliberation , i have decided that the @entity8 should take military action against @entity6 regime targets			1
this would not be an open - ended intervention			2
we would not put boots on the ground			2
instead , our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope			2
but i 'm confident we can hold the @entity16 regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons , deter this kind of behavior , and degrade their capacity to carry it out			0
our military has positioned assets in the region			0
the @entity91 has informed me that we are prepared to strike whenever we choose			0
moreover , the chairman has indicated to me that our capacity to execute this mission is not time - sensitive ; it will be effective tomorrow , or next week , or one month from now			0
and i 'm prepared to give that order			0
but having made my decision as commander - in - chief based on what i am convinced is our national security interests , i 'm also mindful that i 'm the president of the world 's oldest constitutional democracy			1
i 've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might , but in our example as a government of the people , by the people , and for the people			0
and that 's why i 've made a second decision : i will seek authorization for the use of force from the @entity8 people 's representatives in @entity116			1
over the last several days , we 've heard from members of @entity116 who want their voices to be heard			0
so this morning , i spoke with all four congressional leaders , and they 've agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as @entity116 comes back into session			1
in the coming days , my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in @entity6 and why it has such profound implications for @entity8 's national security			1
and all of us should be accountable as we move forward , and that can only be accomplished with a vote			1
i 'm confident in the case our government has made without waiting for @entity136 inspectors			0
i 'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a @entity136 @entity138 that , so far , has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold @entity16 accountable			1
as a consequence , many people have advised against taking this decision to @entity116 , and undoubtedly , they were impacted by what we saw happen in the @entity143 this week when the @entity144 of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal , even as the prime minister supported taking action			0
yet , while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective			1
we should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual			0
and this morning , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 agreed that this is the right thing to do for our democracy			1
a country faces few decisions as grave as using military force , even when that force is limited			0
i respect the views of those who call for caution , particularly as our country emerges from a time of war that i was elected in part to end			1
but if we really do want to turn away from taking appropriate action in the face of such an unspeakable outrage , then we just acknowledge the costs of doing nothing			0
here 's my question for every member of @entity116 and every member of the global community : what message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price ? what 's the purpose of the international system that we 've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world 's people and approved overwhelmingly by the @entity116 is not enforced ? make no mistake -- this has implications beyond chemical warfare			1
if we wo n't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act , what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules ? to governments who would choose to build nuclear arms ? to terrorist who would spread biological weapons ? to armies who carry out genocide ? we can not raise our children in a world where we will not follow through on the things we say , the accords we sign , the values that define us			0
so just as i will take this case to @entity116 , i will also deliver this message to the world			0
while the @entity136 investigation has some time to report on its findings , we will insist that an atrocity committed with chemical weapons is not simply investigated , it must be confronted			0
i do n't expect every nation to agree with the decision we have made			0
privately we 've heard many expressions of support from our friends			0
but i will ask those who care about the writ of the international community to stand publicly behind our action			0
and finally , let me say this to the @entity8 people : i know well that we are weary of war			1
we 've ended one war in @entity59			1
we 're ending another in @entity247			1
and the @entity8 people have the good sense to know we can not resolve the underlying conflict in @entity6 with our military			1
in that part of the world , there are ancient sectarian differences , and the hopes of the @entity256 have unleashed forces of change that are going to take many years to resolve			0
and that 's why we 're not contemplating putting our troops in the middle of someone else 's war			1
instead , we 'll continue to support the @entity6 people through our pressure on the @entity16 regime , our commitment to the opposition , our care for the displaced , and our pursuit of a political resolution that achieves a government that respects the dignity of its people			1
but we are the @entity8 , and we can not and must not turn a blind eye to what happened in @entity21			0
out of the ashes of world war , we built an international order and enforced the rules that gave it meaning			1
and we did so because we believe that the rights of individuals to live in peace and dignity depends on the responsibilities of nations			1
we are n't perfect , but this nation more than any other has been willing to meet those responsibilities			0
so to all members of @entity116 of both parties , i ask you to take this vote for our national security			1
i am looking forward to the debate			1
and in doing so , i ask you , members of @entity116 , to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment			0
ultimately , this is not about who occupies this office at any given time ; it 's about who we are as a country			2
i believe that the people 's representatives must be invested in what @entity8 does abroad , and now is the time to show the world that @entity8 keeps our commitments			2
we do what we say			0
and we lead with the belief that right makes might -- not the other way around			0
we all know there are no easy options			0
but i was n't elected to avoid hard decisions			0
and neither were the members of the @entity324 and the @entity325			0
i 've told you what i believe , that our security and our values demand that we can not turn away from the massacre of countless civilians with chemical weapons			2
and our democracy is stronger when the president and the people 's representatives stand together			1
i 'm ready to act in the face of this outrage			0
today i 'm asking @entity116 to send a message to the world that we are ready to move forward together as one nation			2
