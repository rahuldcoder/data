@entity0 -- a long line of hospital staff wraps around the corridor outside a small conference room in @entity0 to catch a glimpse of the precious cargo			1
a worker looks at the mummified skull of @entity10 in november 2007			2
inside are the three frail bodies in open wooden crates causing all the commotion			0
another body -- a prince no less -- is a few rooms down in a computer tomography scanner			0
the bodies are part of the @entity21 's collection of 11 @entity23 mummies , transported to the @entity24 to be scanned			1
the goal : find out who they are , how they might have died and establish a chronology of advances in ancient @entity23 's mummification techniques			1
the process is not necessarily new			0
@entity23 mummies have been exposed to radiographic study since 1896 and ct scans , which conducts imaging by sections , for more than two decades			1
perhaps the most famous of them , @entity10 ( c. 1355 - 346 b.c. ) , was scanned in 2005 right outside the vault that holds his sarcophagus			0
the scan resulted in more than 17,000 images that were analyzed by an international team of radiologists , pathologists and anatomists , led by the world - renowned @entity47 , the secretary general of @entity23 's @entity49			1
the scope and ability of ct scan technology are proving invaluable in learning more about the funeral rituals of ancient @entity54 and the mummies themselves			1
whereas conventional x-rays can not clearly distinguish soft tissue from bone and can see only two planes , @entity56 can differentiate among the various types of bone and soft tissue , and reconstruct three - dimensional images that " show fine detail inside coronary arteries down to 0.6 millimeters " said @entity67 , director of cardiac ct and magnetic resonance imaging at @entity24 , providing a better chance at diagnosis and differentiation among diseases			1
" @entity56 has proved to be exceptionally well - suited for studying the fragile , wrapped figures of @entity23 mummies , especially those still contained within their decorated plasterlike shells , or cartonnages , " according to an article by a team of eight researchers , led by @entity82 , published in the @entity83			1
@entity56 is fast and non-invasive , @entity67 agrees			1
a scan of one of the four bodies brought to @entity24 quickly revealed that the mummy named @entity89 was actually a man			1
the body never had to leave its cartonnage for the procedure			0
in the case of @entity10 , initial x-rays of his mummy decades ago showed fragments of bone inside his skull , causing speculation that he might have been killed by a blow to the back of the head			2
the scan immediately revealed that his skull was intact ; and the team found no other indication of foul play , according to its report			2
" @entity10 is the icon of @entity23 history , but he is only one of thousands of mummies we can study			1
through ct scans , we can , in a way , bring the dead back to life , " @entity47 told @entity115			2
in another famous case , a ct scan helped identify the mummy of the @entity122 ( 1293 - 1291 b.c. ) in 2000			1
it had been bought from a @entity125 museum by the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128			0
dr. @entity129 , a former radiology resident at @entity130 now practicing in @entity131 , @entity132 , and part of the team of scientists who analyzed the pharaoh 's body , was able to observe a type of bone erosion , and " coalescence of air cells can be seen in cases of chronic mastoiditis , " an inflammatory condition usually due to chronic ear infections			0
though easily treatable with antibiotics today , the pharaoh 's untreated ear infection could have spread and caused his death			0
at @entity24 , @entity150 , director of @entity151 at the @entity152 , said the 64 - slice ct scanner takes 0.6 mm - thick sectional scans and combines and magnifies them to provide extraordinary detail			2
curators of the @entity21 reached out to @entity24 for the first time in 2007 , to scan @entity158 , a 2,000 - year - old mummy , before he was to join a traveling exhibit called " to live forever : @entity23 treasures from the @entity21 , " opening at the @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity165 , in october			1
@entity158 is called a " red shroud mummy " because of unusual red pigment in his linen shroud			2
another red shroud mummy is in the @entity170 in @entity171 , @entity172			2
there , ct scans revealed the remains of a mummified ibis , a bird sacred to @entity54 , wrapped inside			2
curators of the @entity21 wanted to find out whether @entity158 had his own ibis , thought to be a sacrifice to the @entity180 , whose head was an ibis			0
@entity158 did not have one			0
still , dr. @entity183 of @entity24 told the @entity184 in 2007 that @entity158 either " had an easy life or was carried around a lot			0
he certainly did n't do much heavy lifting during his lifetime			0
" the same was true for the mummy of the royal prince count of @entity191 , @entity192 - en - ipet			2
@entity193 , curator of @entity23 , classical and ancient @entity195 art at the @entity21 , said initial findings of his scan reaffirmed his high status : a small incision to the side of the abdomen to remove the organs , while carefully leaving the heart in place , then filling the body with embalming liquids -- all indicated a high - quality mummification process			1
why the heart ? in ancient @entity23 , the heart was considered the thinking organ -- the center of the soul and the source of knowledge , @entity193 said			1
" the heart knows what a person thinks and feels , " he said			0
" it is supposed to be left in place during mummification so that it could be weighed against the feather of truth in the final judgment			0
" the images produced on the latest mummies at @entity24 will have to be studied for months before researchers gain new insight into ancient @entity23 funeral practices			1
in the meantime , some revelations brought to light by the scans beg more questions yet : @entity237 - en - ipet seems to have a tube lodged inside him , running from his mouth through his esophagus and into the top of his chest			0
@entity193 said he and @entity67 are pretty certain that was not the cause of death , and that it was inserted post-mortem			0
purpose ? that might be lost to the ages .			0

radiologists at @entity0 hospital analyze @entity23 mummies
@entity56 testing allow radiologists to study mummies without doing *damaging* procedures
recent ct scan reveals @entity23 mummy named @entity89 was actually a man
