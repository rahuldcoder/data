-- nineteen races and 19 wins			0
after yet another demonstration of her superiority over five furlongs ( 1,000 meters ) , there are few superlatives left to describe the extraordinary record of five - year - old @entity11 mare @entity9			1
unusually for the world 's top - rated sprinter , she was made to work for her victory , with long - time rival @entity16 sticking firmly to her flank at the furlong marker			2
but after a flick of the whip from jockey @entity22 , @entity9 found another gear and pulled away from the field to win the @entity25 at @entity26 by one - and - three quarter lengths in front of an ecstatic crowd of 22,800			2
royal approval : will unbeatable @entity9 grace @entity31 ? " he had me a bit worried for a couple of strides -- i was a little concerned , " said @entity38			0
saturday 's win was @entity9 's ninth @entity41 success and the second time the @entity43 - trained bay has captured @entity11 's premier sprint race , which is also the first leg in the @entity45			1
it also came after she made her debut over seven furlongs ( 1,400 meters ) in the @entity49 at @entity50 the previous weekend			0
@entity9 's incredible run puts her equal with @entity52 ( 1915 - 1917 ) and @entity53 ( 1919 - 1921 ) for consecutive victories on top - class @entity11 tracks ( other horses have won more consecutive races on low - grade country tracks ) , although she is the only horse to win 19 without defeat			1
she is currently ranked joint - second on the all - time undefeated list ; although the run of 54 wins without reply put together by 19th century @entity66 horse @entity67 may yet prove unassailable , even for @entity9			1
but @entity11 's favorite racehorse may have run her last race on home soil , for the time being at least , with her trainer conceding that @entity73 may well be her next stop en route to the @entity76 at @entity31 in june -- the target for her connections			1
" i 'll sit down with the owners , but if she goes to @entity73 she has probably run her last race in @entity11 this prep , " said @entity43			1
if , as is widely expected , the lure of @entity73 's $ 2 million @entity85 proves too great a temptation to resist ( there is a $ 600,000 bonus offered as part of the @entity45 , rising to $ 1 million if she can win on three continents ) , it will mean @entity9 's 20th race could be her toughest yet , pitting her against @entity97 's super colt @entity98			0
it throws up an additional challenge as the race is run over six furlongs ( 1,200 meters ) on a synthetic all - weather track , rather than @entity9 's preferred turf			0
a decision on @entity73 is expected to be made in the coming weeks , with @entity43 having already revealed that @entity9 has had all her vaccinations for both the @entity108 and @entity109			2
" there is 10 weeks in between the two races , so that presents a few problems , but i am familiar with the logistics of it all and it 's an option we are thinking about			0
she 'd already had all her vaccinations for the trip to @entity109 , so that would n't be a concern if she was to go to @entity73			0
'' @entity123 20 proved a race too far for @entity9 's spiritual predecessor @entity125 , the @entity127 race mare who was the last horse to put together an undefeated streak of 19 races			1
there will be many racing fans both back in @entity11 and around the world who will be hoping @entity9 can go one better .			0

five - year - old mare @entity9 extends her winning run to 19 races
the @entity43 - trained horse won the @entity25 in her native @entity11
she is currently ranked joint - second on the all - time undefeated list
@entity9 could now be bound for @entity73 and , eventually , @entity31
