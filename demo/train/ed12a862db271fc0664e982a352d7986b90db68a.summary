it 's the gravest diplomatic crisis the @entity1 has ever faced -- but as leaders from the six - member @entity4 alliance prepare to meet in @entity6 , are things about to get even worse ? the root of the current problem ? @entity10 simply will not do as it 's told by @entity11 and the @entity12 , who have spent months trying to force the energy - rich nation to fundamentally alter its foreign policy			1
@entity17 , the @entity12 and the @entity11 withdrew their ambassadors from @entity10 in march , and have kept up the pressure ever since			1
of course , tensions between @entity11 and @entity10 are nothing new			1
@entity10 has striven since the late 1980s to escape the @entity11 political orbit by vigorously pursuing its own independent foreign policy -- regardless of the displeasure it caused in @entity26			2
the @entity11 , for their part , have never liked this rejection of its leadership from an uppity small country like @entity10 that it sees as barely more than an appendage of its own state			2
but for all the pressure @entity11 exerted on @entity10 -- including withdrawing its ambassador from @entity38 from 2002 - 2008 -- it could not put the @entity10 genie back in the bottle			1
a modus vivendi was reached in 2008 , but the current crisis seems to mark another attempt to put @entity10 in its place			2
among a variety of modern - day issues , the central concern animating this round of difficulties is @entity10 's support for various groups associated with the @entity52 -- the long - suppressed pan-regional @entity54 movement that swept to power in the @entity58 elections of 2012 before being deposed by the military a year later			1
the @entity11 are deeply troubled by the practical and rhetorical threats the group poses in the region			0
and although a @entity52 - inspired revolution seems deeply unlikely in the @entity12 , this is what its authorities fear and the reason they have sentenced to jail dozens of people in the last 18 months			1
in march 2014 both states banned the group and labelled it a terrorist organization			0
@entity10 has made some concessions			0
in mid-august , reports emerged that @entity10 has considered ending the naturalization of nationals from other @entity1 countries -- @entity11 , the @entity12 , @entity17 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- in answer to their criticism of the practice			1
and it beggars belief to think that @entity10 has not made other concessions in private , given the seriousness of the break in regional relations between the countries			0
yet still @entity11 and the @entity12 continue to try to force @entity10 to accept and conform to their particular world - view			1
up to this point , this current disagreement has had a negligible impact on the @entity1 -- and the fact that the @entity1 can not provide a united front on the @entity97 or @entity98 crises is nothing new for the argumentative and perennially - divided group			0
demoting @entity10 somehow from the @entity1 , one of the potential punishments for the recalcitrant state , would merely codify the ineffectiveness of the @entity1 , not create it			0
furthermore , punishing @entity38 would adversely affect on - going efforts to promote " jointness " among the @entity1 militaries in areas like ballistic missile defence			0
and if @entity10 were to need new visas to enter other @entity1 countries , this would foster a logistical nightmare and increase the already bitter @entity115 tensions felt by people			2
if things got worse at the @entity1 , @entity10 would double - down on its relations with the likes of @entity120 , @entity121 , and the remaining @entity52 affiliates in the region , and it would reinforce its relations to its closest international allies : the @entity126 , the @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , and @entity130			1
so what could the @entity11 do to try to bring @entity38 into line ? any closure of the @entity10 - @entity11 border would be deeply harmful for @entity10 given the importance of the route for trade			1
around 80 % of dairy imports , 30 % of stone and cement imports , and 92 % of aluminium imports come across the land border , according to the @entity143 in @entity10			0
if the @entity10 government were to react to this ( even though they have taken the moral high ground by doing nothing so far ) , they could curtail its gas supply to the @entity12 ( and @entity78 ) , which is crucial given the surging demand for natural gas in the @entity12			2
while closing the border would generally be seen as an overreaction by @entity11 , so too was removing its ambassador from @entity10 , not to mention its rejection of the @entity157 seat it won in october 2013 after years of lobbying and training for the role			2
some kind of escalation looks likely , barring a last minute reprieve			0
@entity11 and the @entity12 appear to want a public sign of contrition from @entity10 -- something that the new emir of @entity10 can not give			1
not only can the @entity167 not overturn decades of @entity10 policy that has sporadically supported groups like the @entity52 , but barely a year into his leadership , he can not capitulate to such naked regional pressure			1
vociferous and patriotic public pressure in @entity10 alone precludes that			0
and as the on - going @entity121 - @entity126 nuclear talks have lowered tensions in the region , so too have the talks diminished the only real factor -- the threat of a nuclear iran -- forcing any kind of cohesion from the @entity1			0
the @entity1 does face a serious political crisis , but though this may concern the countries involved , the tiff will likely pass mostly unnoticed by the rest of the region -- and the oil , the gas , the investment , the imports , and the money going to a wide variety of groups around the @entity195 will continue to flow from all states .			0
