-- think of the greatest @entity3 sports stars of all time and names like @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 will likely spring to mind			1
but long before these champions smashed the record books -- and blazed a trail in the public 's imagination -- the first generation of black @entity17 athletes dominated an unlikely sport			1
the godfathers of @entity21 , @entity7 and @entity8 were n't stereotypical towering , musclebound men found on basketball courts or in boxing rings			2
instead , they were the jockeys of the race track and their dizzying success -- and dramatic fall -- is one of the most remarkable buried chapters in @entity17 sporting history			1
when the country 's most prestigious horse race , the @entity34 , launched in 1875 , 13 of the 15 jockeys were @entity3			1
much like the @entity36 today , black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades , winning 15 of the first 28 derbies			1
" they were the premier horsemen in the world , " says @entity39 , author of " @entity40 , " which tells the story of champion jockey @entity42			0
" it was the first professional sport for black athletes in @entity46			0
they were at the forefront of horse racing and it was a place where they could earn a good living			1
" decades before @entity54 made history in 1947 as the first black major league baseball player , @entity3 jockeys forged a name as the first sports heroes of @entity46			1
the son of a former slave , @entity59 was the first jockey to win three @entity61 -- in 1884 , 1890 , 1891			0
he went on to win an unheard - of 44 % of all his competitions , becoming the first rider inducted into the @entity64			0
" @entity59 was the first millionaire black athlete , " @entity39 told @entity0			0
" he even had a white valet			0
" many of these jockeys had been slaves in the @entity68 , working as stable hands and becoming skilled horse handlers			1
plantation owners put them on the backs of horses in informal -- and dangerous -- competitions			0
when horse racing became an organized sport in the early 19th - century , black jockeys were already leaders in the saddle			1
yet fast forward to today and you 'd struggle to find an @entity3 jockey on a @entity17 race track			1
just 30 of the around 750 members of the national @entity84 's guild are black , according to the most recent figures available			0
@entity42 was the last @entity3 to win the @entity34 -- in 1901 and 1902 -- and by 1921 they had all but disappeared			2
it would be 79 years before another black rider , @entity88 , competed in 2000			0
the introduction of the @entity91 laws in the late 1880s -- segregating blacks and whites -- spelled an end to the golden era of jockeys like @entity42 and @entity59			2
increasing violence against black jockeys forced many to abandon racing and move to northern urban areas , says @entity39			1
" it became too dangerous to put black riders on horses , " he added			2
" an influx of @entity105 immigrants were now slugging it out on the track , riding black jockeys into railings and making them fall			1
" other riders , such as @entity42 , fled to @entity110 -- which had a thriving horse racing industry			1
" the @entity110 were colorblind , you had jazz players and heavyweight boxers like @entity116 -- it was basically the last place black @entity3 sportsmen could go , " @entity39 said			1
here , @entity42 's career skyrocketed as he won the @entity110 derby four times and amassed a fortune			0
he was treated like a celebrity , socializing with aristocrats in @entity126 's court and marrying two white @entity128 countesses			0
decades later , segregation still ruled @entity46 , and when @entity130 invited @entity42 to a reception at the @entity132 in @entity133 in 1961 , he was told he could n't enter by the front door			0
today , @entity135 is perhaps the most successful of the few black jockeys competing in the states , boasting more than 4,000 career victories			1
the 42 - year - old , who won the most @entity17 events in 2010 and 2011 , entered the sport after his father worked as a racing official			2
" black people are n't on the track like they used to be , " he said			2
" if you do n't have someone in your family who 's in the business , you do n't have a reason to start racing			2
" @entity135 , the 54th - ranked jockey of all time , says racing is now dominated by @entity154			0
@entity155 , national manager of the @entity84 's guild , agreed , estimating that 60 % of jockeys in the @entity17 are @entity154			2
of the current top - 10 highest earning jockeys , nine are from @entity160			0
" from black to @entity105 to @entity163 , jockeys in @entity46 tend to mirror immigration , " @entity39 said			2
" the conditions are the same as 200 years ago -- the best jockeys tend to be from rural countries , they grow up around horses , it 's tradition and it 's a family business			0
" for @entity135 , jockeys like @entity59 and @entity42 did n't just change the face of racing -- they paved the way for generations of black @entity3 sports stars			1
" they got black athletes in the door , " he said			0
" it 's an honor to be ranked among them			0

first black @entity3 sports stars were n't basketball players -- they were jockeys
many became skilled horse handlers while working as slaves in the south
today , just a few black jockeys compete on @entity17 race tracks
horse racing now dominated by @entity163 riders
