the flip - flop concerns the case of @entity12			1
she was 28 weeks pregnant with twins when she went to the emergency room of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity5 , vomiting and short of breath			2
she went into cardiac arrest in the lobby and died			2
her husband , @entity23 , sued the hospital and its owner , @entity26 , for the wrongful deaths of his wife and their unborn sons			1
given the @entity34 's belief that life begins at conception , defense attorneys for the hospital and doctors then entered an unusual argument			1
proposal would give way out of birth - control coverage they said that under state law , an embryo is not person until it is born alive			2
the claim attracted widespread attention and criticism , which apparently forced the about - face			0
" in the discussion with the @entity34 leaders , @entity26 representatives acknowledged that it was morally wrong for attorneys representing @entity16 to cite the state 's @entity53 in defense of this lawsuit			0
