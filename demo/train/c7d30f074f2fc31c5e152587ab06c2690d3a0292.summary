the barbaric , elaborately stage - managed video that showed @entity4 pilot @entity2 being burned alive was a calculated move by @entity7 leader @entity6 to weaken the resolve of @entity4 and other @entity11 @entity10 powers that have joined the @entity13 - led coalition against the terror group			1
but the early signs indicate the video , which may have been shot a month ago , has had the opposite result , creating a significant backlash from @entity11 in the region			1
spreading terror has worked before for @entity7 , allowing it to punch above its weight			2
in the weeks before launching an assault on @entity24 , @entity25 , in june , the group released a series of gory videos showing the militants brutalizing and killing @entity25 soldiers they had captured			0
it put the scare in the @entity25 army			0
when @entity7 fighters attacked @entity24 , @entity25 soldiers turned and fled despite greatly outnumbering the attackers			2
@entity35 was no doubt hoping to pull off the same trick this time			0
the release of the video to coincide with @entity4 @entity40 's visit to the @entity13 may have been deliberate -- the optics of the @entity4 king in @entity43 served @entity7 ' narrative of the kingdom being a vassal of the " @entity47			1
" but @entity7 appears to have badly miscalculated			0
@entity48 was from a prominent @entity11 tribal family in @entity4 , and his killing has sparked outrage			1
and if support in @entity4 for @entity40 's involvement in the @entity56 coalition was lukewarm before , it is now red - hot			0
there has also been outrage across the @entity59 , with the head of @entity62 's @entity61 , @entity11 's most prestigious center of learning , reportedly calling for @entity7 fighters to be crucified			1
indeed , while the video has electrified @entity7 ' most hard - line supporters around the world , and will likely help persuade foreign fighters to join it rather than @entity71 , it is also likely to shrink its potential pool of recruits			2
the reality is that burning to death a fellow @entity76 is so at odds with mainstream @entity79 teaching that even some @entity7 sympathizers may have second thoughts			0
it 's a point underscored in november when @entity83 , a mentor in a @entity86 @entity85 scheme to prevent radicalization , said @entity7 ' beheading of @entity86 aid worker @entity89 was putting off young @entity86 @entity79 from joining the group			0
in the long run , @entity7 ' brutality is not a winning strategy , as @entity71 has recognized			1
exactly a year before the release of the video of the @entity4 pilot being burned alive , @entity71 's general command severed ties to @entity7 for its excess brutality and killing of @entity79			1
in the coming weeks , @entity4 is likely to step up its air campaign against @entity7 in @entity103 and @entity25			1
but its greatest contribution to the @entity56 coalition will likely be its significant intelligence gathering capabilities in those two countries , which we can expect to be expanded			0
@entity4 intelligence played a key role in gathering intelligence that led to the @entity13 airstrike that killed @entity4 @entity7 founder @entity114 in @entity25 in june 2006			1
of course , such expanded action carries the risk that @entity7 and its supporters will retaliate with attacks in @entity4			1
the pre-dawn executions of @entity120 , an @entity7 female icon who was part of a team that killed almost 60 in hotels in @entity125 in 2005 , and @entity126 , an @entity114 aide captured in 2006 , has deeply angered the group			0
plus , @entity4 already had a significant home - grown radicalization problem -- as many as 2,000 @entity4 are believed to have traveled to @entity103 and @entity25 to fight , many with @entity7			1
meanwhile , several @entity4 fighters appeared in an @entity7 video released last year calling for @entity40 to be slaughtered			1
in addition , last summer saw significant @entity137 demonstrations in @entity138 ( @entity114 's birthplace near @entity125 ) and @entity140 ( a southern desert tribal town ) by extremists excited by @entity7 ' declaration of an @entity79 caliphate			2
altogether , there are an estimated 9,000 pro-jihadi extremists in the kingdom , according to @entity148 , and analysts fear that number is growing due to high unemployment and other socioeconomic problems that are creating a fertile atmosphere for recruitment			0
another worry is the presence of extremists among the 620,000 @entity103 refugees who have fled to @entity4			0
all that said , the picture in @entity4 is not all gloomy -- its overwhelmingly @entity11 population at least has meant there is relatively little sectarian tension			2
and the brutal burning to death of one of their own has also mobilized @entity4 's conservative tribes against @entity7			2
but in taking the fight to @entity7 and its supporters inside and outside the kingdom , one thing is clear -- @entity40 will need every ally he can get .			0
