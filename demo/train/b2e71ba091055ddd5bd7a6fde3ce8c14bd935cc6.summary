-- @entity5 's $ 250 million sci - fi epic " @entity3 " earned an underwhelming $ 500,000 at midnight showings , the studio confirmed			1
according to @entity5 , that figure is in line with what 2010â € ²s " prince of persia : the @entity10 " earned			0
that movie , also a costly adventure flick , wound up debuting to $ 30.1 million -- and @entity5 would really like to see a " 3â € ³ in front of @entity3 's weekend gross			2
but it 's still way too early to tell , as midnight figures can not be entirely trusted			2
after all , just last friday , " @entity19 " took in $ 1.2 million at midnight screenings en route to a $ 21.1 million weekend			0
admittedly , " @entity19 " is a more midnight - friendly movie than " @entity3 , " but then consider last year 's action fantasy @entity21 , which grossed $ 1.4 million at midnight showings and finished its first weekend with $ 32.2 million			1
however " @entity3 " performs this weekend ( we 're predicting a $ 26 million debut ) , the movie will likely find a bit more love overseas			1
@entity5 announced that the film already posted the biggest opening day ever in @entity31 with a projected $ 6.5 million			0
