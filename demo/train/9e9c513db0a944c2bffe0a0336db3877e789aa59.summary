@entity0 -- since @entity4 was first elected president in 2008 , the word " change " was popular with @entity6 who were seeking to win elected office			0
@entity4 effectively used it to tap into voters ' disenchantment with president @entity12 , and he ultimately swept into the @entity13 in a watershed year for @entity6			2
but with the 2014 election on the horizon , @entity15 gov. @entity14 , chair of the @entity16 , said this year 's gubernatorial contests wo n't be about that operative word			1
key gubernatorial races in 2014 " i am not so sure that this is the change election , " @entity14 said tuesday during an editorial board meeting with @entity1			1
" i think this is the election where voters care about one thing , middle class voters , both independents and @entity6 , care about one thing : did you or can you create better opportunities for us and our kids ? " the @entity16 leader continued by stating that voters who have suffered through " 10 years of a stagnating economy " and have slowly " seen jobs trickle back , " want to know what candidates are " going to do to improve my wallet			1
" " i do n't think it is going to be a lofty , idealist change election , " @entity14 concluded			1
2014 : what 's at stake four years removed , the 2010 midterm election looms large over this november 's contests			1
@entity47 - in both @entity48 and in the states legislatures - won major gains by tapping into @entity52 sentiment and riding the @entity54 wave			2
but those same @entity47 now have to defend their wins -- @entity47 governors are left to defend 22 governorships in november compared to only 14 for @entity6			2
according to @entity1 's initial analysis , roughly half of this year 's 36 races for governor could be competitive			1
@entity6 are on the defensive in two highly competitive races , in @entity64 and @entity65 , while @entity47 are defending four toss - up races , in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
five races are " tilting " in favor of @entity6 - @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 - and another five are " tilting " in favor of @entity47 - @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
the other seven @entity16 seats and 13 @entity47 seats are considered safe			1
for @entity14 , the man in charge with ensuring @entity6 make gains in november , the map is tiling in his favor			0
in particular , the @entity15 governor said @entity6 plan to use the way @entity47 ran in 2010 against them			2
" these guys got elected as the reformers , do you remember that ? " @entity14 said			0
" in 2010 , tea party governors got elected as reformers			0
" @entity14 went on to hit a number of @entity47 governors for ethics investigations and tax cuts for high - income earners			1
he said that the last four years of leadership from @entity107 gov. @entity106 , @entity109 gov. @entity108 , @entity83 gov. @entity110 , @entity67 gov. @entity111 and @entity84 gov. @entity112 prove that @entity47 are n't reformers			0
" any myth that these guys are reformers is officially dead , " @entity14 said			0
by pressing a message centered on raising the minimum wage and strengthening the middle class , those campaigning for @entity16 governors and candidates feel like they are in better position to make gains in 2014 than congressional democrats , where it is looking more likely the @entity6 will continue to be a minority in the @entity13			1
republicans , as expected , have a different view of the map			0
in a tuesday statement , @entity132 , spokesman for the @entity133 , said , " while @entity136 governors continue to raise taxes , increase spending , and waste hardworking taxpayers ' money on failed @entity142 exchanges in their states , @entity47 governors are cutting taxes , lowering spending , balancing budgets , reforming education and driving the @entity149			1
" will @entity47 's @entity142 focus pay off ? why are some @entity6 running from @entity142 ? @entity4 : republicans ' were wrong ' about @entity142 republicans also have bragging rights when it comes to money in the bank			2
the @entity133 raised $ 23.5 million in the first quarter of 2014 , nearly doubling the $ 12.5 million their @entity16 counterpart brought in			2
the @entity133 haul was a record for the group and more than doubled what it raised in the first three months of 2010			0
" @entity133 's strong financial position will give us the resources to push back against the public sector unions and the @entity13 , who have targeted @entity47 governors and candidates for defeat , " @entity162 , the group 's executive director said earlier this year			1
@entity6 hope to make up those fundraising gaps in the coming months and are using a prolific @entity16 fundraiser - former president @entity173 - to do just that			0
@entity173 will headline a may fundraiser with @entity177 , the @entity16 gubernatorial hopeful in @entity65 , and the former president will also headline a @entity16 fundraiser for @entity182 in @entity183 on may 6			0
@entity184 , however , has not been asked by the @entity16 for help in the midterms			0
@entity173 , who left the @entity187 in early 2013 and is now considered the frontrunner for the @entity16 presidential nomination in 2016 if she runs , has largely stayed away from highly political events in favor of paid speeches and corporate engagements			0
@entity14 downplayed the fact that @entity173 has yet to campaign for the @entity16 and noted that she did help her longtime friend @entity196 , who ran and won the @entity199 governor 's mansion in 2013			1
" the @entity200 have been really helpful to us , " @entity14 said			0
" obviously , you know @entity184 is kind of laying a little bit low these last few months since she stopped being secretary of state but president @entity173 has been hugely helpful			0
... everybody would love to have the @entity200 help and we are getting it			0
" meet the woman who could turn @entity211 purple @entity110 's re-election bid : it 's complicated @entity214 mounts long - shot bid special coverage : the 2014 midterms @entity1 's @entity218 contributed to this report .			1
