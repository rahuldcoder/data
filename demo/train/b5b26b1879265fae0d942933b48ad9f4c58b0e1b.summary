she has said it before			2
now she 's saying it again			2
" @entity4 " filmmaker @entity3 has written at length in an essay published in the @entity7 about the scenes of torture featured in the movie , insisting once more than " depiction is not endorsement			1
" the controversy has dogged the movie for weeks as politicians and pundits attacked the movie , which was based on screenwriter / producer @entity19 's interviews with intelligence and military sources , for showing @entity23 agents beating and torturing suspects who later give up information that leads to @entity26			1
in the essay , @entity3 declares herself to be a pacifist who abhors the so - called " enhanced interrogation techniques " the movie shows , but says she felt obliged to put on screen the gruesome details of what was done in the name of counter-terrorism			1
an excerpt : " first of all : i support every @entity42 's @entity41 right to create works of art and speak their conscience without government interference or harassment			0
as a lifelong pacifist , i support all protests against the use of torture , and , quite simply , inhumane treatment of any kind			1
but i do wonder if some of the sentiments alternately expressed about the film might be more appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered these @entity42 policies , as opposed to a motion picture that brings the story to the screen			0
those of us who work in the arts know that depiction is not endorsement			1
if it was , no artist would be able to paint inhumane practices , no author could write about them , and no filmmaker could delve into the thorny subjects of our time			2
" this comes at a critical time for the movie , which just opened nationally last weekend , coming in at first place with $ 24 million at the box office			2
it 's also a strong contender for several @entity81 , including best original screenplay for @entity83 , best actress for star @entity85 , and best picture â€” although @entity3 was snubbed in the directing category			1
her essay in the @entity7 expresses things she has already stated several times			0
" i 'm not sure i have anything new to add , but i can try to be concise and clear , " she wrote			0
can this help at the box office ? does it need to if it 's already faring well ? will this satisfy @entity81 voters who may be troubled by the criticism ? we 'll see as it plays out			0
right now , the only certainty is that sometimes in an echo chamber , you have to repeat yourself			0
see the original article at @entity104 .			0
