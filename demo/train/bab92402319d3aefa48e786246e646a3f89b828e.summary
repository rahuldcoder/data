@entity0 -- it has risen -- floor by floor , gleaming steel beam by steel beam -- from the scene of what was incomprehensible destruction more than a decade ago			0
now , as 1 @entity11 in @entity12 stretches closer toward being the tallest building in the @entity14 , it already stands as an icon in its own right			1
punctuating the @entity12 horizon , the once - named " @entity20 " also was once fraught with controversy and costly redesigns			0
but it 's soon expected to top off at 1,776 feet -- technically edging out the @entity22 in @entity23 by way of decorative spire affixed to its peak , and replacing the @entity11 that fell to terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001			1
" everybody takes pride in this building , " says @entity28 , deputy general superintendent of the construction firm @entity29			1
" everyone 's an important piece of the puzzle , whether you 're an iron worker , whether you 're a painter , everyone has a job to do			1
" " we 're all here to see this through to the end , " adds @entity28			0
crews at the site are gearing up for president @entity46 's visit thursday to the work - in - progress -- which now has reached 104 stories -- for an update on its upward growth			1
the building is expected to open in about a year and a half			1
" we 're going to have our topping - out beam placed on the street " so that president @entity46 can sign it , says @entity53 , general superintendent at 1 @entity54			1
" it 's going be the first signature on the topping - out beam , " he adds			2
" it 's typically signed by everybody on the project at some point and then we 're going to erect it shortly thereafter to signify the topping out of @entity68			2
" on the 92nd floor , workers can often be seen hanging off beams as they twist steel rods into a lattice framework while blowtorches spray sparks against the upper floors			2
steel beams fall 40 stories at @entity11 construction site lacking external glass at such heights , the structure is edged by black netting to prevent loose objects from falling into the plaza more than a thousand feet below			1
@entity86 was broken in april 2006 , on a redesign by the architectural firm of @entity89 , with construction starting later that year			2
" the structure itself is a hybrid , " says @entity91 , @entity29 's project executive			0
" the perimeter is steel , the core is concrete			0
" he calls it " the strongest concrete we 've ever used in @entity0 , maybe in the @entity14 , for an office building			0
" " the walls are extremely thick , and all of the building supplies , elevators , all the risers , all telecommunications are within that concrete structure inside the building , " he says			0
from the 92nd floor , workers are able to watch planes approach the @entity115 's three major airports , a subtle reminder , they say , of the thousands who died on that september day			1
" @entity118 , when it 's complete , will symbolize everything that was lost in 9/11 , " @entity53 says			0
" it also will symbolize our resiliency as a nation , all the hard work put in by everybody			0
" september 11 memorial debuts in @entity0			0
