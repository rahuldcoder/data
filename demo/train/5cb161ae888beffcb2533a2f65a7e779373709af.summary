-- an investigative judge has placed former @entity4 president @entity2 under formal investigation for breach of trust , accusing him of taking advantage of elderly @entity9 cosmetic heiress @entity8 to help fund his 2007 campaign , @entity2 's attorney said , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity11			1
the former president was summoned to appear at @entity15 - @entity14 's office in @entity16 on thursday in a case in which he is suspected of accepting illegal contributions from @entity8 and her staff , @entity11 said			2
his lawyer , @entity20 , said that he intends to appeal the ruling , according to @entity11			0
the @entity23 scandal has fascinated @entity4 since questions about the finances of @entity4 's richest woman emerged in 2011 amid a family feud			1
although formal , the investigation of @entity2 , 58 , is considered preliminary , and could lead to trial or may go no further			1
the son of a @entity32 refugee father and @entity4 mother , @entity2 was 28 when he became mayor of @entity35 , a @entity37 suburb			1
he left that post in 2002 to serve as interior minister and then finance minister under president @entity41			0
( @entity41 was convicted in 2011 on corruption charges tied to his time as @entity37 mayor			0
) ten days after his runoff election win , @entity2 became president in 2007			1
he served in that capacity for the next five years , garnering praise for his work on foreign policy issues and criticism for his handling of domestic issues as @entity4 's economy sputtered and unemployment rate hovered at about 10 %			1
in may 2012 , @entity56 beat @entity2 in his bid to win a second term as president			2
and just over two months later -- one day after he and his family were set to head off to @entity61 for a vacation -- police raided his home and office as part of their investigation into possible illegal campaign financing , according to @entity20			1
" it 's not a surprise , " @entity69 , a senior foreign analyst for @entity70 , said at the time			0
after losing his re-election bid , @entity2 " was going to lose his diplomatic immunity , " opening him up to potential prosecution			0
in fact , the probe appeared well under way by then			0
in september -- when @entity2 was still president -- three investigators engaged in an hourlong search of his political party headquarters , seeking documents linking his campaign to the alleged political contributions from @entity23			2
judge @entity87 questioned the former @entity4 leader in november for 12 hours concerning evidence given by @entity8 's former accountant , @entity90 , @entity11 reported			2
afterward , authorities said they 'd decided not to pursue a formal investigation of @entity2 , but rather to treat him as what officials call a " witness - under - caution			1
" the phrase is a technical term that essentially allows a @entity4 magistrate to continue to call the ex-president to the witness stand			0
at the same time , it did n't close the door to @entity2 facing criminal charges stemming from allegedly illicit campaign donations .			0
