a new @entity1 law making it a crime to publicly deny the @entity4 's genocide of @entity5 a century ago was ruled unconstitutional tuesday by @entity1 's @entity6			1
the measure , which triggered condemnation from modern @entity9 , was given final passage by the @entity11 and signed into law by president @entity13 last month			1
@entity13 's office immediately issued a statement calling for a new version of the law " taking into account the decision of the @entity6			1
" " the president believes that genocide denial is intolerable and must be punished in this regard , " the statement said			2
the country 's highest judicial body reviewed it at the request of @entity28 members and @entity1 senators			1
" @entity32 deems the law unconstitutional , " a short statement from the court said tuesday			1
the @entity9 government called it " an example of irresponsibility " and vowed to " express our reaction against it in every platform " when the bill passed the @entity28 -- the lower house of the @entity1 parliament -- in december			1
the @entity43 issued a statement tuesday that called it " pleasing that a grave mistake has been corrected by the highest legal authority in @entity1			1
" " we hope @entity1 will from now on be in a constructive attitude for the dispute between @entity9 and @entity50 on history to be considered on a fair and scientific basis , and will make contributions that support a solution rather than further deepening the problem , " the @entity9 ministry said			1
" such an attitude will contribute to the @entity9 - @entity1 relations to improve in all areas as well			1
" @entity50 's government hailed the passage last month , saying @entity1 " reaffirmed its pivotal role as a genuine defender of universal human values			2
" it is already illegal in @entity1 to deny the @entity65 , a crime punishable by a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros ( about $ 60,000 )			0
the same punishment would apply under the @entity50 legislation			0
the @entity9 - @entity50 controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist			0
@entity50 groups and many scholars argue that @entity9 committed genocide starting in 1915 , when more than a million ethnic @entity5 were massacred in the waning days of the @entity4			2
@entity9 officially denies that a genocide took place , saying hundreds of thousands of @entity50 @entity81 and @entity9 @entity82 died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of @entity86 i. sen. @entity87 , one of the bill 's supporters , argued that since @entity1 already recognizes the @entity4 - era killings as genocide , the same standard that applies to @entity65 denial should apply to the @entity50 case			1
" when we contest the @entity97 genocide , we can be punished , " @entity87 said			0
" and up until now , when we contest the @entity50 genocide , there is no punishment			0
so we ca n't have a legal punishment for one and not for the other			0
everyone is equal in front of the law			0
" but sen. @entity106 , who opposed the legislation , said freedom of expression was at stake			0
" it calls into question historical and scientific research			0
tomorrow will there be a question of a @entity119 genocide ? " he asked , referring to a revolt against the @entity1 revolutionary government in 1793			2
" will we put the @entity121 and the @entity122 in the stocks for the massacre of @entity125 ? we must reject this text and consign it to history books			0
" after december 's vote in the @entity28 , @entity9 prime minister @entity128 accused @entity1 of committing its own " genocide " during its war against @entity132 independence in the 1950s and 1960s			1
@entity128 announced that @entity9 was reviewing its ties with @entity1			1
@entity135 recalled its ambassador to @entity137 for consultations , canceled bilateral visits and would n't cooperate with @entity1 in joint projects within the @entity141			0
the @entity142 shot back at @entity128 's comments , saying @entity1 " assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history			2
" and @entity13 has said that his country does n't need an ok from another nation to develop its policies			0
in addition to being @entity156 allies , @entity9 and @entity1 have trade ties valued at $ 13.5 billion , according to @entity9 statistics			2
the genocide debate is also a source of tension between @entity9 and the @entity122 , another @entity156 ally			2
the @entity164 , for example , annually beats back efforts in @entity166 to pass a resolution that would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of @entity5 as genocide .			0

" a grave mistake has been corrected , " the @entity43 says
" @entity32 deems the law unconstitutional , " @entity1 's highest court says
president @entity13 calls for a new version of the law addressing the court 's concerns
@entity9 denies genocide and says the deaths *resulted* from @entity184 fighting
