-- on wednesday , a federal grand jury indicted the former director of the liver transplant program at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , for allegedly lying about a liver accepted for one patient but transplanted instead into another patient who was lower on the waiting list			1
dr. @entity15 , 54 , of the @entity17 area of @entity18 , was named in the eight - count indictment , which accuses him of conspiracy , concealment of a material fact and six counts of falsification of records , the @entity13 attorney 's office for the @entity14 of @entity6 said in the indictment			1
the alleged incident occurred in september 2003 , when the hospital was offered a liver for one of its patients , identified as @entity34 was second on the match list because of his poor condition , but he was in his home country of @entity39 , the indictment said			1
the next patient listed for the liver was at another area hospital , it said			2
instead of telling the organ procurement organization of the switch and letting the organ be offered to the backup patient , @entity15 approved acceptance of the liver and its transplantation into @entity52 , a patient at @entity4 , the indictment said			1
@entity52 was ranked 52nd on the match list behind nine other @entity4 patients , it added			2
after @entity52 got the liver , @entity15 and his co-conspirators falsely told authorities at the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) -- the private , nonprofit organization that contracts with the @entity63 to allocate donated organs -- that @entity65 had received the liver , the 19 - page indictment says			1
@entity15 later submitted a falsified pathology report on @entity65 's removed liver , it added			1
that led officials to remove the ailing a-h from the wait list , even as @entity15 was telling the man that he was still on the list , the indictment said			1
in april 2004 , @entity15 told @entity65 to return from @entity39 to the @entity13 , which he did , it said			1
but by that time , @entity65 was too sick to undergo a transplant , so he returned to @entity39 , where he died , the indictment said			1
the indictment further alleges that @entity15 and unnamed co-conspirators asserted in reports filed until 2005 with @entity61 that @entity65 had in fact received the transplant			1
that year , management at the hospital discovered the switch and cover - up and told authorities , it said			0
" it came to light after @entity61 did a routine audit , " said @entity91 , assistant @entity13 attorney , major frauds section , in a telephone interview			0
a new administrative head of the hospital 's transplant program " basically discovered that he [ @entity65 ] had not been transplanted and she reported it to upper management , and upper management reported it to @entity61 , " @entity91 said			2
asked what might have motivated @entity15 , she said , " i really ca n't comment on that			2
" she noted that the charges stem from the alleged cover - up , " not from the decision to make the switch			0
" though it appears that , in making the switch , @entity15 violated @entity61 regulations , federal authorities did not address whether those violations rose to the level of a federal crime , she said			2
" the system that 's in place is a very admirable system , if people would play by the rules , because it is a system designed to ensure equity in the allocation of livers , " she said			0
" it sets us apart from countries where people literally traffic in these organs for money			0
it is a system very worth protecting , but the integrity of the system depends first and foremost on people being honest with the system			0
if you actually lie about who got a liver , that 's a really fundamental perversion of the system			2
" @entity138 cut its ties with @entity15 in 2005 and ended its liver transplant program in 2006 as a result of the incident , said @entity143 , director of marketing , in a telephone interview			1
@entity15 's lawyer , @entity145 , said he had not read the indictment , but denied that his client had falsified any documents and said @entity15 's decision to transplant @entity52 was based on medical need			1
" a medical decision was made that that individual was going to die , and if a transplant was not made he would have died			2
that individual is alive today because of the transplant			0
" a @entity61 spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment			0
the hospital has cooperated with authorities in the investigation , the @entity13 attorney 's office said			0
in a written statement , the hospital said it was " pleased that the federal prosecutors have concluded their investigation , and that the actions of a rogue physician , acting outside of the scope of his duties and hospital policy , were criminal in nature			0
" @entity15 is scheduled to make his initial court appearance in @entity177 in @entity5 on january 25			0
if convicted on all eight counts , he faces a maximum penalty of 130 years in federal prison			0
the case was investigated by agents from the @entity63 , @entity183 and the @entity184 .			0
