-- part of the enduring appeal of @entity3 is the sheer random nature of it all -- the way videos of a @entity9 pop song or a doped - up kid after a dentist visit can go from obscure to internationally known in a matter of days			1
but increasingly , the @entity14 's leading video site has also been working to become the @entity16 's cable provider , mixing channels of its own original content , often in partnership with established stars , into the mix. last october , @entity3 announced 100 new channels , featuring everything from sports to comedy to educational videos			1
on monday , it announced plans for another 40 , with an international bent that includes channels from @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33			1
the site also rolled out some impressive numbers about how the project has gone so far			2
@entity3 says its top 25 original channels average more than 1 million views per week			1
about 800 million people are watching 4 billion hours of content on its original channels every month , an increase from 3 billion earlier this year			1
" from local cuisine , health and wellness and parenting to sports , music , comedy , animation and news , this new lineup of original channels will have something for everyone , " said @entity43 , @entity3 's global head of content , in a blog post			1
" they are backed by some of the biggest producers , well - known celebrities and emerging media companies from @entity64 and the @entity65 " the new offerings include " the @entity67 , " from @entity68 , @entity32 auto channel @entity69 and " city magazine " rendezvous a @entity71 from @entity31			1
new @entity65 offerings include health - food channel @entity73 , @entity75 from @entity76 and @entity77 , featuring short comedy clips by writers from " @entity80 , " " @entity81 , " the @entity83 comedy troupe and elsewhere			2
just getting started with @entity3 's original channels ? here are five we think might be of interest to @entity88 readers : @entity89 @entity90 ) is a series of conferences designed to bring together serious thinkers in an effort to share " ideas worth spreading			1
" @entity89 is an initiative that grew out of that			0
it is a curated series of education videos , which are good for teachers in need of extra resources			0
they are allowed to customize the videos to suit their needs and share them , publicly or privately , free			0
it 's also fun for anybody looking to bone up on @entity109 's laws or learn how to write great essays			2
advisers to the project include @entity113 of @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , the co-director of the education - oriented @entity118 and mother of @entity122 ceo @entity121			2
@entity123 celebrating all things geektastic , " @entity123 " is helmed by @entity125 , an icon of sorts in the world of @entity16 fandom who brought her groundbreaking web series , " @entity131 , " to the channel			0
other top draws include the video version of the " @entity147 " podcast , in which @entity136 and @entity137 ( he a host and she an alum of " @entity142 , " ) talk science fiction and fantasy literature , and " tabletop , " featuring actor @entity145 and guests talking about , and playing , board games			2
for related , but unique , material , also check out " @entity151 " podcast host @entity153 's channel			2
the @entity156 sound ok , we know this might look shameless , but it 's not			0
( the @entity156 spun off from @entity160 , which owns @entity0 , in 2004 )			0
besides , this has been the no. 1 original @entity3 channel every week since june			1
yes , @entity156 is a music juggernaut , and you 'll find the occasional video by platinum artists like @entity167 and @entity168			0
but @entity169 celebrates " the other side of music " and the majority of posts feature more alternative , lesser known or up - and - coming acts ( lp , @entity174 , the @entity175 , @entity176 )			0
our favorite bit of weirdness ? " @entity187 , " in which a space alien who has hijacked a @entity185 variety show interviews musical acts			0
@entity188 whether it 's a 10 - minute biography of enigmatic inventor @entity191 ( @entity192 gets called an " asshat " ) or explaining the makeup of bath salts , the amphetamine that makes people do " bat - crap crazy " things , veteran video - blogger @entity189 makes science both understandable and fun			1
that is , when he 's not running an online record label , playing his own music or writing or recording videos for , like , 100 other blogs and websites			1
@entity206 on @entity206 , " @entity208 " actor @entity207 invites you to " open your heart without feeling like an idiot			0
" an extension of his website by the same name , @entity206 is informed by @entity207 's @entity216 faith and challenges viewers to consider issues of spirituality , philosophy and creativity , among other heady topics			0
we need nurturing , " @entity207 said at last year 's @entity226 in @entity227 , @entity228			1
if that sounds heavy , know that it 's sprinkled with @entity207 's wit			0
a recent video calling for a holiday on @entity235 , featured ( for some reason ) an 18th century sharecropper with gold coins hidden in his posterior .			0

@entity3 adds 40 channels , many with international focus , to its original - content lineup
the site 's top 25 channels now average more than 1 million views every week
the effort kicked off last year with 100 channels , many partnering with celebrities
