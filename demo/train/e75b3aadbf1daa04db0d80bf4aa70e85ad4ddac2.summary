the ill - fated @entity1 cruise ship returned home wednesday with an ignoble mark			1
nearly 700 crew and passengers fell ill aboard the @entity8 , the highest number of sick people reported on any cruise ship in two decades , @entity11 data show			1
at least 630 passengers and 54 cruise workers got sick , but not all at the same time			1
some passengers suggested that the outbreak may have been worse than reported			1
" they claim there were 600 ; i think there could have as many as 1,000 " sick people on board , passenger @entity17 told @entity18			1
" some people i know did n't bother going down to the infirmary			2
they were n't feeling well , so they went to the state room			2
they did n't report it			2
" after the cruise , @entity27 told @entity18 that she discovered the scope of the outbreak when she was taken to a makeshift infirmary in a wheelchair and sick passengers were everywhere , vomiting in buckets and bags			1
she said she waited three hours to be seen			2
" i just started crying , " she said			2
" i could n't believe it			2
because i thought i was the only one that was sick , and then when you see everyone else sick , it really upsets you even more			2
" are cruise ships floating petri dishes ? @entity45 said she was anxious to catch a flight back to @entity48 with her husband			2
the tickets will cost them an additional $ 2,000 on top of what they paid for the cruise and travel			2
" i never wanted to go home so much in my life , " she said			1
" i 've had enough			0
i 've never slept so much			0
" @entity45 said the ship arrived late on the first day of the cruise , and it appeared that there was n't sufficient time to clean it			1
" the seas were so rough , they shut the doors for 2 days , " she said			0
" we had no air			0
there was no air , no circulation ... and that 's why , i think , we got ill. " @entity72 said she was on a honeymoon , but she and her husband spent a couple of days sick			0
" we were looking forward to staying warm and being on our honeymoon and enjoying our time together , and we 're never gon na get that back , " she said			0

" that was the last thing we wanted to look it , " he said of food			0
" it was terrible , terrible			0
" @entity77 said entertainers became sick			0
some sick passengers refused to admit being ill to avoid being confined to their rooms , he said			1
" that happened a lot from what i 'm hearing , " said @entity77 , who sneaked out of his cabin several times for crackers and ginger ale for him and his wife			0
he added , " it was atrocious			0
they tried to do whatever they could do			0
but once you feel like we were feeling , it was n't worth it			0
i doubt if i 'll be back			0
" @entity77 said @entity1 offered sick passengers credit for days they spent confined to their cabins			1
" i do n't know if i 'll ever see the inside of another ship again , while it 's in the ocean , put it that way , " he said			1
' i lost five pounds ' one passenger was seen being put on a stretcher and taken to ambulance , but the cruise line said in a statement that he was transported to a hospital for a " reason unrelated to norovirus , " a common cause of gastroenteritis , which produces vomiting and diarrhea			1
" best cruise of my life , " one passenger joked as he left the ship			1
" i lost five pounds			0
" before the ship arrived at port in @entity131 , @entity132 , one frustrated passenger voiced her displeasure with the experience			1
passengers disembarked in northern @entity132 shortly before 2 p.m. wednesday , with some set to stay in area hotels until they can catch flights back home -- days before the @entity140 will be played there			1
" are we bringing this virus off the ship with us ? " asked @entity141 , a passenger from @entity142 who was traveling with a party of 12 people -- 10 of whom have been sick			1
" we 're all going to hotels all over the @entity150 area			0
will we be spreading the virus to the @entity140 this weekend ? " @entity141 told @entity18 via telephone that she was upset and felt as if she had spent a week on a floating prison			1
" it 's just been a big nightmare , " she said			0
" it feels like ( @entity1 ) never had a contingency plan in place to handle an epidemic on the ship			1
" @entity141 said it was evident early on that many people were sick			0
she felt the ship should have been turned around			1
" on wednesday night , i was in the dining room and a woman was vomiting into her napkin , " she said			0
" there were people walking around in their pajamas with vomit and diarrhea on them			0
people were barfing all over the place			0
" not all passengers , however , were dissatisfied			1
" we had a wonderful cruise , and they were very nice , " said @entity175 on sunday , five stool samples were sent from the ship to the @entity11 in @entity181 , where the samples were expected to arrive the next day , @entity11 sources told @entity18			1
but the arrival of the samples has been delayed because of paperwork issues and the bad weather in the @entity187			0
in a statement wednesday , @entity1 said the entire ship will undergo a " thorough ' barrier ' sanitization program ... to make certain that any remaining traces of the illness are eliminated			2
" " it will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue , and will additionally provide a window of more than 24 hours where there are no persons aboard the ship , which is a significant help , " the statement said			2
the ship had 3,071 passengers and 1,165 crew members , according to the @entity11			1
no official cause for illnesses , but norovirus possible explorer of the @entity211 departed @entity212 , @entity132 , on january 21 for what would have been a 10 - day cruise			1
passengers and crew developed symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting			1
@entity11 officials boarded the ship in @entity222 on sunday to study the outbreak and the response on the voyage back to @entity212			1
the cause of the illness was not clear , though the symptoms are consistent with norovirus , the cruise line said			1
noroviruses spread easily and are a common cause of gastroenteritis , which produces vomiting and diarrhea			0
" the number of reported new cases of gastrointestinal illness has dropped sharply after a spike in the first days of the cruise , and most guests who fell ill are up and about , " the cruise line said monday			0
" the drop in new cases is encouraging			0
however , it is not unusual in an outbreak to still have smaller , secondary spikes			0
that is why , after discussions with the @entity11 and our medical team , we decided the most prudent course for the health of our guests and crew was to bring the cruise home on wednesday , two days earlier than planned			1
" the company said all passengers would get a 50 % refund and a 50 % credit for a future cruise			2
those passengers who were ordered quarantined to their rooms will get an additional credit of one future cruise day for each day in confinement , it said			2
" guests scheduled for the next cruise on @entity8 can be confident that all possible measures will have been taken to prevent further problems , " it added			0
what you need to know about kids and norovirus five things we 've learned about cruising after a bad cruise , can you cruise into court ?			2
