@entity0 -- the @entity2 discussed friday a resolution introduced by @entity4 that calls on @entity6 president @entity5 to step down and transfer power to his vice president			1
the resolution also supports " full implementation " of the @entity12 report on @entity6 that called on @entity6 to form a unity government within two months but stopped short of supporting military intervention			1
the @entity12 report was released about a month after it sent observers into @entity6			1
@entity12 secretary - general @entity17 and @entity19 's prime minister @entity18 , are expected to brief the council tuesday about the observer mission 's findings			2
when asked whether that briefing would lead to a vote next week , @entity24 's @entity0 envoy @entity23 responded with just one word : " @entity28 , " or " @entity29 willing " in @entity30			2
@entity32 ambassador @entity31 said a vote could be held as soon as wednesday on the text			0
" it was quite clear that there was very strong support in the @entity2 this afternoon for the text that was introduced by @entity4			0
" the next step is a meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the @entity2 , on monday afternoon			1
the @entity2 has been unable to agree on any resolution on @entity6			1
in october , @entity45 and @entity46 issued a rare double - veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in @entity6			1
this latest draft also lacks sanctions , but is tougher than the october version , which said nothing about transfer of power			1
the draft resolution , obtained by @entity1 , calls on @entity5 to hand over authority to his deputy and calls for the formation of a national unity government			1
the draft gives @entity6 15 days to comply or risk the adoption of further measures			1
advocates of a resolution -- especially @entity32 , @entity24 , and @entity65 -- hope that a stark briefing from the @entity12 will be enough to persuade @entity45 not to use its veto power			1
after friday 's meeting , @entity45 @entity0 envoy @entity68 said , " i just can not see the draft which we saw today as a basis of a possible outcome			2
but we will continue to engage with the sponsors of this resolution			2
" he said there were some red lines that he would not allow the @entity2 to cross			0
" the red lines include any indication of sanctions , " he said			0
" the red lines included any sort of imposition of arms embargo , because we know how in real life , arms embargo means that you supply weapons to illegal groups but you can not supply weapons to the government			2
we can not accept that			0
unfortunately the draft which we saw today did not ignore our red lines but also added some new elements which we find unacceptable as a matter of principle			2
" he went on to say that those added things included the idea of imposing a political outcome			0
this week , the @entity45 ambassador to the @entity100 accused the @entity100 and @entity101 of trying to turn a @entity2 resolution on @entity6 into an " @entity108 " resolution , a step that , he argued , could " be a recipe for disaster			1
" @entity23 was sanguine : " frankly , i do n't think it will be too difficult to reach an agreement , " he told reporters			0
and @entity65 ambassador @entity112 said world body must take action			0
" let 's seize this window of opportunity that we have			0
" but @entity6 ambassador @entity119 was dismissive of his colleagues			1
" some of these ambassadors who have been entrusted by the so - called international community to maintain peace and security in the world through their important role in the @entity2 have chosen to undermine peace and security in the world -- following their narrow strategic and geopolitical interests , " he said			0
" they deal with us as if we are a former colony -- that we should subjugate ourselves to their will			0
they are wrong and they will be disappointed			0
" he continued , " @entity6 will not be @entity139 ; @entity6 will not be @entity140 ; @entity6 will not be @entity141 ; @entity6 will not be a failing state			2
" @entity1 's @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this story .			0
