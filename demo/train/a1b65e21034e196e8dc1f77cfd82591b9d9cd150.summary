-- " when the history is written of this era , this is how you 'll be remembered : ' he was the first black president			1
' okay , not a bad accomplishment , but that 's it			1
that 's it , mr. @entity9			1
" -- @entity11 we have become used to sky - is - falling rhetoric from filmmaker @entity11 , but what is n't hyperbolic about the sentiment packed into that quote is the disappointment many supporters of sen. @entity9 have in president @entity9			1
earlier this year , one in four @entity20 and two in three @entity21 said this administration has let them down , according to a @entity24 / @entity23			1
it seems once the euphoria of 2008 wore off , voters were shocked to learn the country 's first black president was n't as radical as his election			1
he 's shown himself to be idealistic but methodical			2
a compassionate figure with a thing for drones and kill lists			0
these days , he is thinking legacy			2
but what will history say about the man who was voted into office with a mandate to end the war in @entity43 and now will likely leave that office with a new war in @entity43 trailing behind ? as the bombing in @entity49 by the @entity50 , and to a lesser extent , a cadre of allies , was getting under way , @entity9 delivered a thoughtful address to the @entity54 on wednesday			1
he called out @entity56 nations that " accumulate wealth through the global economy , and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down			2
" he dared to challenge @entity63 to reject those who rally around a bastardized version of the @entity66 faith and then use that doctrine to justify chaos			0
he spoke of a crossroad between " war and peace , " " disorder and integration , " " fear and hope			1
" remember that word ? hope			0
it was the word @entity9 used to ignite the movement that would lift him from his position as a little - known junior senator from @entity80 into the @entity81 and onto the world stage			1
he promised to change the way things had always been			2
now @entity11 and others are disappointed because they believed him			2
after winning the @entity87 @entity20 caucus in january 2008 , @entity9 told the rabid crowd that the country was choosing unity over division and that " this was the place , this was the moment where @entity50 remembered what it means to hope			1
" six years later , a @entity96 poll found fewer @entity97 approve of the job @entity9 's doing than the national average -- 38 % to 43 %			1
what will history say about the man who encouraged immigrants to dream big and then left them hanging for the sake of the midterm election ? who has overseen 54 consecutive weeks of private - sector job growth , the longest stretch in history			2
who pledged to close @entity112			0
who ok 'd the mission that led to the death of @entity116			0
who promised to be transparent			0
in 2007 , @entity118 gave a speech in support of @entity9			1
she said , " we need a new way of doing business in @entity124 and in the world			0
... i 'm tired of politics as usual			0
" and yet here we are			0
@entity127 left @entity128 and @entity43 for @entity9 to sort through , and now it is likely @entity9 will leave behind @entity43 and @entity49 for his successor			1
opinion : @entity50 's wartime president at the @entity54 , @entity9 explained in detail why it was important to defeat @entity135			1
instead of a soaring delivery , he spoke plainly about the choices that lie in front of us all , intelligently shifting the point of emphasis from destroying terrorist groups to derailing their instruments of recruitment , funding , and their very philosophy			2
" no @entity147 condones this terror , " he said			2
" there can be no reasoning -- no negotiation -- with this brand of evil , " he said			0
" the only language understood by killers like this is the language of force			0
" and then he reiterated that he is prepared to lead in this force for the remainder of his presidency			0
it was the kind of rhetoric we were accustomed to hearing from his 2008 opponent , sen. @entity165 , who has yet to see a war he did n't want us to be a part of			2
it was the kind of rhetoric his 2012 opponent , @entity171 , said would make him the better leader			0
it was the kind of rhetoric that has become as much a part of @entity9 's complicated legacy as the @entity177 , the rise in lgbt rights and the slow , but real , economic recovery			1
@entity49 now becomes the seventh predominantly @entity63 country in which he has authorized military strikes			1
perhaps his earlier persona contributed to his resistance to do so sooner , despite the advice of his inner circle			0
when one takes power under the guise of a peaceful change agent , one should pause before ordering airstrikes , if for no other reason than not wanting to contribute to the @entity194 's carnage			1
but for the next two years , he is committed to doing just that			0
he does n't have much of a choice , really			0
terrorists are reportedly developing articles of clothing that explode			0
i shudder to think what will be in store for airline passengers dealing with @entity205 screenings if such a thing comes to pass			0
how will history remember @entity9 ? what will his legacy be ? it appears a lot of that will depend on how many people the @entity50 kills before he leaves office			1
that 's not why many of us voted for him , but i guess the rest of the world did n't get the memo			0
we voted not to bomb people			0
i wonder if he 's as disappointed in the way things have turned out as the rest of us .			1

@entity229 : @entity49 bombing a *reminder* that @entity9 is not the president his supporters *expected*
polls show @entity20 , *independents* disappointed . will war , in the end , be @entity9 's legacy ?
elected as war - ending change agent , @entity9 spoke this week about @entity50 strikes on terror
