@entity0 -- we may not immediately equate the activities of archaeologists to trash sifting			1
or imagine that the glass - encased artifacts in museums might be one - time refuse			0
but quite often , this is exactly the case			0
studying ancient trash from around the world gives archaeologists and historians the chance to understand the habits that defined people 's daily lives , said dr. @entity17 , director of the @entity20 's @entity19 and senior lecturer on anthropology at @entity22			1
it may not be glamorous but , he said , " much of what archaeology knows about the past comes from trash , if trash is defined as the products of human consumption			1
trash is a proxy for human behavior			2
" the @entity20 is staging a series of talks and events , entitled @entity36 : the @entity37 until @entity38 , on the importance of trash to our understanding of human behavior , both in the past and now			1
meadow , who has excavated sites including the ancient @entity48 city of @entity49 in present - day @entity50 , has gleaned much from studying centuries - old trash			1
early dumping grounds , or " middens , " are often archaeological and anthropological gold - mines , he said , not just for what can be found there but for what they tell us about ancient civilizations , what they consumed and how they organized their urban space to deal with their waste			1
" the way that ancient cities used to grow and change through time is actually very much related to the evolution of trash , " @entity17 explained			2
ancient people , he said , quite literally lived with their trash , usually dumping it in the streets outside their homes when it was n't collected and deposited in special pits			1
sometimes , he said , whole cities would be filled with trash , to the point where the street levels would rise , submerging homes and forcing people to build on top of it			2
while this might sound revolting and unhygienic to us now , ancient peoples , said @entity17 , became acclimatized to it			2
and they were at least adept at recycling their trash			2
" i think almost all civilizations recycled in one way or another , " @entity17 said , explaining that ancient peoples across the world would recycle organic matter as fuel , while inorganic refuse would be used to build the foundations of a house			2
precious metals , he said , would be melted down and re-shaped for a variety of tools			0
" it 's only when you get to the modern period of consumerism that you get this culture of obsolescence , " he said			0
dr. @entity110 is a professor of @entity111 at the @entity112 and an expert in the social and economic history of the @entity116 , with a special interest in the production and trade of food in the ancient world			0
he is the director of excavations at an ancient dump site in @entity124 called @entity125			0
an artificial hill composed of more than 25 million discarded @entity116 amphorae -- or vase - shaped containers -- it tells us much about the ancient @entity116 trade in olive oil , which these amphorae were used to transport			0
" a dump can be a particularly interesting source ( for finding out ) about the daily life ( and ) development of the civilization that created it , " said @entity133			1
from the shards found at @entity125 , he said , archaeologists were able to trace the evolution of food policy in the @entity116			0
" @entity144 is a very special dump , which gives us information about a concrete product -- olive oil -- and the relations between the capital of the @entity116 and one of its provinces , " @entity133 explained			0
this prizing of ancient trash may seem at odds with our attitudes to waste today			1
but according to @entity17 , scientists are already at work studying our trash and what it says about us			1
he cites as an example @entity165 archaeologist @entity164 , director of the " @entity167 " in @entity168 , which has sifted through and studied garbage from 1973 to the present day			0
" some amazing statistics have come out of this -- how much food gets thrown out in the trash that was probably ok to eat , and other things hardly used that were thrown away , " said @entity17			0
" it 's an incredible array of material , " he concluded			0
dr @entity17 will give a lecture entitled ' the archaeologist 's view of trash ' at the @entity20 on october 6 .			1

ancient trash is an important *resource* for archaeologists
trash pits or " middens " tell us much about the daily life of our *forebears* , according to archaeologists
@entity20 is staging a series of lectures about the importance of trash to archaeology
scientists are studying our trash right now to find out what it says about our culture
