it 's a sunny april afternoon at the @entity2 in @entity3			2
some students huddle in groups conversing in hushed voices ; others hurry between buildings carrying books			2
exams begin in a week			2
on a grassy knoll behind an office block , @entity11 is giving his 24 children a talking to			2
" study hard everyone , " he says			2
" if you work hard you can improve your life and make it better			0
" this is n't your typical family			0
none of his " children " share his dna			0
in fact , the only thing linking them is that they 're all genocide survivors -- ethnic @entity28 who lost their families in the 1994 violence that killed 800,000 people			1
' it 's because of history ' creating " artificial families " to help young genocide survivors cope is the brainchild of an organization called the @entity38 ( @entity39 )			1
originally founded by 12 @entity2 students in 1996 , they 've expanded to 43,397 university and high school students from across the tiny east - central @entity45 country today			1
@entity39 initially creates families from members based on the secondary school or university they attend , after which the newly - formed family meet to democratically elect a willing father and mother from among their ranks			1
though they do n't all live together , they do help each other out financially and attempt to pool their resources			1
in the university of @entity61 's @entity60 alone there are 21 such families , with hundreds more being set up across the country			1
" ( we ) @entity61 , we used to have big families but during the genocide many people were killed , " says @entity65 , @entity39 's second vice coordinator at the @entity2			1
" to fight against that , we have to build artificial families so that we can go back to the way we were , " he adds			1
" that 's why you can find a father with 25 children -- it 's because of that , it 's because of history			0
" @entity39 national coordinator @entity80 explains that the concept stems from a basic necessity			0
" you need someone to care about you , " she says , adding that the aim is that the families will stay together for life			1
" when you get married your family will be there ; they 'll be the first to help you			0
" scarred by war @entity93 estimates that 95,000 children were orphaned as a result of the genocide			1
seventy per cent witnessed murders or injuries , while many were victims of violence and rape themselves			0
their problems continued after 1994			0
by 2001 , an estimated 264,000 @entity61 children had lost one or both parents to @entity104 , a disease which was partly spread through the use of rape as a tool of war			1
today many of these young people suffer disproportionately from poverty , homelessness , trauma and legal issues , including having had their deceased parents ' land taken away from them when they were too young to claim it			1
bringing light back @entity61 is currently in the middle of 100 days of mourning			1
the 20th anniversary commemorations have been upsetting for many of the young people who still carry both physical and mental scars from the past			1
@entity124 , @entity125 at @entity126 , says that trauma permeates into many different aspects of their lives : " many for example have difficulties studying , maintaining relationships , or have issues with drugs and alcohol			0
" @entity137 , 21 , says that being in a family environment helps young people to deal with their emotions			1
" some people used to be very angry			1
" he says that together they discuss their feelings and how to control them enough so that they can live peacefully with their neighbors			0
yet , he adds , trauma among his peers is still a huge issue			0
" we have kids who have been so shocked from genocide that they have a permanent shock -- that is one of our big problems			2
" but overall , it seems that they are in good hands			0
@entity158 , 27 , calls up his artificial mother for all sorts of small things			2
" for example if i do n't have a pen , or i do n't have soap , " he says			0
younger than several of his artificial offspring , @entity11 says that fatherhood is a lot of responsibility but he relishes it			2
" you have to know every situation that your children are in -- if they 're studying without any problem , if they 're eating , everyday life			0
if one of them is sick i have to be the first one to know it			0
" he has named their family @entity178			0
" @entity180 , " @entity11 says , " means to light something up			0
it 's when something was dark , and now it is bright again			0
