we need to help every child get ahead , " @entity2 said , urging @entity3 " to send me an education reform bill i can sign into law before the next school year begins			1
" mindful of the budget debate currently enveloping @entity0 , @entity2 insisted that education funding must remain robust because it is vital to the nation 's future success			1
" we can not cut education , " @entity2 said , noting that families facing tough times cut back on vacation or movies or eating out , rather than dipping into savings for a child 's college tuition			1
" a budget that sacrifices our children 's education will be a budget that sacrifices our country 's future , " he said			1
the @entity11 was originally passed in 1965 and requires periodic reauthorization			0

a pair of @entity70 @entity69 agree			0
" although we have our different approaches , everyone agrees the current law is broken and in need of repair			0
the status quo is failing both students and taxpayers , " reps			2

" no one disagrees on the importance of education , " @entity48 said sunday			2
" for the most part , we 've been largely aligned with leaders on both sides of the aisle , but we need to come together and do the right thing for our children			0
" for @entity2 , that means increasing the incentive - based concept of his " @entity101 " program that offers extra funding for states that show home - grown education reforms are improving performance			1
he proposed expanding " @entity101 " to let local school districts apply , and said reforming " @entity12 " should build on the program 's goals			1
the president made a point of promoting the importance of teachers , calling for them to get more pay and respect as valued assets in the nation 's future success			1
