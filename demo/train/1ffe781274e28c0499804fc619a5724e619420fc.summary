today , @entity0 will kick off the @entity2 nominating process for president of the @entity4 with the first - in - the - nation caucuses			1
but why a tuesday ? the short answer : we vote on tuesday for absolutely no good reason			2
this is true especially when you consider the @entity4 , arguably the world 's most famous democracy , has ranked near the bottom of all nations in voter participation for more than half a century			1
and that 's not because , as @entity17 suggested to me last month , we need great candidates to increase voter turnout			1
heard of @entity21 ? @entity22 ? the little - bit - longer answer : we vote on tuesday because of a law passed in 1845 meant to make voting convenient for @entity4 traveling by horse and buggy			1
when @entity28 set out to pick a day for @entity4 to vote , ultimately settling on the tuesday after the first monday in november , voting could take two days : a day to get to the county seat to vote and a day to get back for market day on wednesday			1
they could n't travel on the @entity33 sabbath , so by process of elimination , tuesday , the first convenient day of the week , was chosen			2
it was as simple as that			0
in 2012 , it 's as dumb as that			0
just a few weeks ago i sat in @entity41 diner in @entity42 , @entity43 , and as i looked out the window in one of the most fertile farming states in our country , i did n't notice a single @entity49 hitting the highway in a horse - drawn carriage			2
so why are we still voting on a day set for a time when slavery was legal , only white males voted , less than half of our 50 states had been established and " automobile " was a made - up word ? since @entity61 , @entity4 voter turnout has averaged under 50 % in federal elections			1
in 2008 , with unprecedented excitement about the presidential campaign and record money spent by the candidates , voter turnout was about 64 % , not a record , and a third of all eligible voters did n't make it to the polls			1
to understand the benefits to democracy of weekend voting , all you need to do is look at the nations with the highest voter turnout and realize they vote on weekends or national holidays			1
in an @entity4 where 45 million 18 - to 29 - year - olds , the largest potential voting bloc in the country , are in school or at work all day , where single parents have to take care of their kids , and many of us , as much as we want to , are prevented by other obligations from making it to the polls in the middle of the week , it 's clear it 's time to move @entity95 to the weekend			1
critics and contrarians say that in an age of early and absentee voting , moving @entity95 to the weekend is n't necessary			2
indeed , that 's exactly what @entity101 said when i met him after my recent meal in @entity42			0
but as i politely reminded him , absentee and early voting is not allowed in the @entity43 caucuses			0
in about 14 other states , regular voting is still only tuesday -- and in person , if you do n't have an approved excuse			2
you do n't have to remind me that moving @entity95 is n't a pocketbook or kitchen table issue			0
i 'm well aware election reform could n't be less sexy or more wonky			0
just last week i was asked by @entity118 , the @entity43 radio host , if the push to move @entity95 was a " serious campaign			0
" i paraphrased what @entity120 once said : voting is the right upon which all other rights are protected that 's exactly why ambassador @entity127 , congressional scholar @entity126 and @entity129 chairman @entity128 founded @entity130 , why @entity4 rep. @entity131 , @entity133 - @entity132 , and sen. @entity134 , @entity135 , have introduced the @entity136 into @entity28 to move @entity95 to saturday and sunday , and why i went to @entity43 in december to ask our presidential candidates what they 'd do to protect our right to vote			1
although he did n't know why we vote when we do , 2012 candidate @entity142 said it best : " i do n't think there 's anything magical about tuesdays			0
" any teenager will tell you that when your computer starts running slow , you do n't sit around and hope that it fixes itself			0
you upgrade your operating system			0
the operating system of our nation , our democracy , is broken			0
there 's certainly no silver bullet that will increase @entity4 voter participation			1
but we 've voted on the same day for 166 years			0
our voter turnout is terrible			1
it 's time the @entity4 upgrades to a voting system 2.0 , and we should start with weekend voting .			2

@entity162 : the @entity4 ranks near the bottom of all nations in voter participation
@entity162 : tuesday was set in 1845 , to help voters traveling by horse and buggy
nations with highest voter turnout hold elections on weekends or holidays , he writes
he says weekend elections would help those in school or working to vote more easily
