-- in less than a week , @entity1 will hold its first direct presidential election , yet the mood about the country can hardly be described as electric			1
this is strange given the usual excitement around elections in @entity1 , the historic importance of this poll , and the exceptionally high level of socio - political tensions in recent years			1
besides the summer heat and the @entity15 fasting month of @entity16 , the relative lull might be explained by the widespread anticipation that prime minister @entity18 , candidate of the ruling @entity19 , will emerge triumphant from the ballot box , in either the first or the second round			2
@entity18 understands power and pursues it like no other politician in @entity1 's modern history			1
he has a tightening grip over all key state institutions , save perhaps the @entity27			0
he also has a deeply emotional relationship with his followers , who rally around their leader more passionately as he faces stiffer opposition to his increasingly personal rule			0
this is how he has survived massive anti-government protests , a damaging feud with former @entity37 allies and a high profile corruption scandal , an appallingly mismanaged industrial disaster and successive foreign policy debacles -- latest being the abduction of 49 @entity1 diplomats and consulate workers in @entity44 by @entity46 militants , whose rise some critics attribute in part to the @entity19 government 's open border policy for jihadis fighting in @entity52 -- all in the space of a year			2
this might also explain the somber mood around many of his opponents , who seem to believe that having come so close to realizing his long standing ambition of becoming @entity1 's first popularly elected president , @entity18 will not let the opportunity slip			1
but the lull should not overshadow the critical importance of the election			0
to be sure , an @entity18 victory would amount to no less than regime change for @entity1			1
it would mark the most crucial step yet in its decade - long transformation from an imperfect parliamentary democracy under military tutelage towards a " plebiscitarian democracy " -- characterized by a powerful executive , a weak or compliant legislative , and a charismatic leader - follower relationship that is periodically reaffirmed in general elections and referenda			0
one would be mistaken to think of the presidency , under @entity1 's existing parliamentary system , as a ceremonial post that would deprive its occupant of the executive powers of a prime minister			1
@entity1 has had ambitious presidents , such as @entity84 ( 1989 -- 1993 ) and @entity85 ( 2000 -- 2007 ) , whose influence was checked by hostile lawmakers or meddlesome generals			2
a president @entity18 would n't face these obstacles : his party controls the parliament and the military has been tamed through @entity94 - backed reforms and two highly politicized court cases			2
the current constitution , drawn up by the military junta in 1982 , gives the head of state significant authorities , which @entity18 would push to the limit by invoking the " national will " he claims to embody ; a claim that would be further reinforced and personalized in the event of his election			2
where would this scenario leave those who feel increasingly alienated , stifled and marginalized in @entity18 's new @entity1 ? another electoral loss would be sure to further dispirit those who hoped to see some change to the political status quo after the gezi protests of last summer			1
but in defeat , there might be a valuable and necessary lesson			0
the two main opposition parties -- the secular republican @entity117 and the nationalist @entity118 -- have formed an informal coalition for the sole purpose of posing a numerical challenge to the @entity19 's relative majority , with @entity123 being their chief unifying cause			0
party leaders have handpicked candidates and determined election strategies with minimum public consultation			0
only a handful of people were involved in the selection of @entity131 , the former secretary - general of the @entity132 , as the two parties ' joint candidate for presidency			0
predictably , this uninspiring , ultra-pragmatic , top - down tactic came short in the local elections ( even when one takes into account the allegations of voting fraud , the @entity19 remains the clear overall winner ) and risks failing in the presidential one			0
more importantly , this style of politics is inimical to the grassroots , democratic and pluralistic vision that the " @entity148 " has aspired to capture			0
whatever the outcome of the presidential election , those who wish to see this vision transformed into reality would be better served by focusing on the long term process rather than short term gains , and on building organizational capacity at the level of local politics instead of obsessing over the control of state institutions in @entity161			2
success in local politics paves the way for success in national politics , as @entity1 's political islamists have shown time and again over the past two decades			1
but a true democratic transformation also requires devolution of political authority			0
since its foundation as a republic 91 years ago , @entity1 's excessively centralized political architecture has allowed those who attain control of the state to force their will on the entire population			1
the machinery that repressed ethnic minorities and pious @entity183 in the past is now alienating non-practicing @entity183 , @entity185 , @entity187 members and other social and political minority groups who do not fit in with @entity18 's vision of an overtly religious neo-liberal @entity1			1
only a well - organized movement that takes its strength from local politics and stands for pluralism , decentralization and democratic rights and liberties of all citizens can break this vicious cycle of suppression and alienation			0
