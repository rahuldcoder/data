@entity0 -- time to brush off the veto stamp			2
for someone who 's only used it twice , president @entity3 may need some reacquainting with the last remaining weapon in @entity9 ' arsenal			1
he last rejected a bill from @entity11 in 2010			0
but he 's had blocking from a @entity14 @entity13 majority until now			1
they 've stood in the way of bills most democrats would oppose			0
things are likely to change in january , when republicans take charge of the @entity13			1
if @entity13 @entity23 follow the path of their @entity26 counterparts , he could be faced with proposals to repeal @entity28 and budgets that cut entitlement programs - the type of bills that will meet a quick end at the other end of @entity35			1
@entity3 to voters : " i hear you " " @entity11 will pass some bills i can not sign			1
i 'm pretty sure i 'll take some actions that some in @entity11 will not like			0
that 's how our democracy works , " @entity3 said at a news conference wednesday			1
so what 's left for either side to achieve ? here are four things that @entity3 can -- and ca n't -- do with the new @entity11 : immigration - he can sign an executive order republicans and @entity9 both want to reform the nation 's immigration system			1
but that 's about as far as the @entity26 and the @entity26 @entity55 have gotten in hammering out an agreement that would increase border security and ease deportations			0
related : 2016 starts now the @entity26 says the @entity26 had its chance on immigration reform when it balked on taking up a measure that passed the @entity13 on a bipartisan basis			1
instead , @entity3 plans to announce an executive order that most speculate will drastically reduce the number of yearly deportations			1
initially meant for the end of the summer , the announcement was pushed until after the midterms -- much to the chagrin of immigration reform supporters			0
now the @entity26 says it 'll happen before the end of the year			0
but while the action may enrage @entity23 , it ca n't go nearly as far as legislation would			0
when the next @entity11 begins , the @entity13 bill praised by the @entity26 becomes null -- any potential new law would have to pass the @entity13 again			1
related : obama delays action on immigration executive action @entity3 's executive order would likely forestall any hope of getting republicans on board , though @entity3 reiterated wednesday his order would be nullified if @entity11 takes action			1
" you send me a bill that i can sign , and those executive actions go away , " was his message to @entity55 leaders			0
based on public statements from @entity23 , however , the chances of a bill after @entity3 's executive action are small , meaning any legislative fix to immigration would come in the next @entity11 -- after @entity3 leaves office			1
climate change - he can add to limits on carbon emissions if @entity3 was n't getting anywhere with the last @entity11 on stemming carbon emissions -- and he was n't -- he certainly wo n't gain any traction with the new one led by sen. @entity103 , who defeated his opponent partly by framing her as an ally in @entity3 's " war on coal			1
" the president has already put forth executive actions curbing emissions from coal plants and putting new limits on emissions , which angered @entity23 who claimed it amounted to executive overreach			2
the @entity26 says more unilateral moves to combat climate change are on the docket ahead of an international climate change conference in @entity120 next year			0
related : @entity3 says climate change deniers are " serious threat " but like immigration , any major new laws designed to curb emissions would meet a quick end in the @entity55 controlled @entity13			1
and with @entity23 -- some of whom deny that man - made climate change even exists -- chairing key committees with oversight over @entity3 's @entity134 , the prospects for lasting change appear to have dimmed			1
closing @entity135 - his options are more limited the chances of shuttering the @entity135 in @entity138 through legislative action have n't changed -- they were slim before tuesday and they 're slim now			0
republicans and @entity9 alike on @entity141 are wary of signing off on a law that would permit @entity3 to transfer detainees from the facility to the @entity145			1
while other countries have agreed to accept certain prisoners , others are deemed too dangerous to release			0
the administration wants to find places in the @entity145 to house them so the reviled @entity135 can be closed			0
without @entity11 ' approval , @entity3 would have to use his own executive authority to push through a change , a move that would undoubtedly prompt cries of overreach by lawmakers			1
but it would fulfill a promise that extends back to his first campaign for president			2
@entity163 needs help from @entity11 it 's two areas of economic policy -- trade and tax reform -- the @entity26 believes could present the most potential for cooperation with a @entity55 @entity13			1
but even there chances of new deals appear slim			0
two major trade deals , with @entity175 and about a dozen @entity177 countries , have been stalled while @entity9 refuse to offer so - called " fast track " authority to @entity3 to get the pacts hammered out			2
they 're worried the trade measures could ship jobs overseas			0
republicans , however , have been more amenable to the plans as potentially a boon to @entity145 business			0
whether they and @entity3 can agree on the final plans depends largely on the two sides ' willingness to work together			2
likewise , tax reform is an issue both sides at least agree needs to be addressed			0
@entity3 and @entity23 want to lower corporate rates and simplify the code			2
at one point , the @entity26 and @entity196 @entity23 were casting the issue as the key area of agreement should @entity11 fall into @entity55 hands			0
but some key players are no longer around : rep. @entity203 , the @entity55 chairman of the @entity204 and someone who was open to a tax deal with @entity3 , is retiring at the end of this @entity11			2
that leaves open whether or not there 's still an opening to find a deal			0
if there is , it would form a major part of @entity3 's legacy			2
on wednesday , @entity3 insisted the agenda he 's set for himself was still operative			2
" the one thing that i 'm confident about is that i 'm going to be pretty busy over the next few years , " he said .			0

republicans will take over control of the @entity13 in january
president @entity3 will lose the @entity14 majority that has *spared* him the need to veto
