@entity0 -- i did n't really know what to expect when i got to @entity4 , @entity0			1
i knew that many people here were followers of @entity7 , better known as the @entity8			2
and i was here to visit @entity10 -- also known as the @entity8 university			1
@entity12 graduated from here in 1971			1
i was visiting the school to find out how they viewed their famous alumnus , and if people would vote for him because he was of the same faith -- that report comes next week			2
for the moment , let me muse on my visit to @entity10			1
i went to university in @entity23 in the 1980s			1
it was a time of political ferment			2
@entity26 was at its peak			2
we had demonstrations and sit - ins			2
the students ' union was a hotbed of political activism			1
most big @entity37 schools were like that in those days , as we battled everything			2
@entity41 train : no better way to connect with @entity44 voters the campus of @entity10 is a world apart from my experience ; new buildings , manicured lawns , and plenty of flower beds to beautify the surroundings			1
and a student body that frankly looks nothing like the student ragamuffins of my own university days			1
the bell tower lets you know this is a religious - based institution			0
at 12 o'clock they ring out a selection of light hymns as part of the top - of - the - hour chimes			0
meeting staff and students , i felt the differences almost immediately			1
the polite inquiry as to whether i 'd like " a beverage " had me checking myself before replying " oh , coffee would be lovely			0
" @entity10 follows a strict interpretation of the @entity73 and caffeine is banned on the campus			1
flustered , i could n't think of much else quickly enough besides " oh , a water would be lovely			0
" @entity77 : a barometer for the swing states the students here have a different air about them			1
walking around the campus it looks as if they have all bought their preppy clothes from @entity86 , @entity87 or similar			1
nothing wrong with that of course			0
oh , and everyone smiles			0
the woman at the ice cream shop smiled			0
the guides showing me round the university smiled			2
the student who handed me @entity8 literature smiled			0
it was hard to imagine any of these clean - cut youths suddenly bursting into a bout of obscenities as they stubbed a toe or dropped a plate			0
@entity106 : will frontier state call the election ? respectable and respectful throughout is the best way to describe them , and for good reason : they have all signed the @entity113			0
the code requires them to be , among other things , honest , true , chaste , benevolent and virtuous			0
there is a reminder on a poster at the bowling alley , which announced " we follow the honor code " and asked visitors to uphold standards of grooming and dress			0
when i suggested there was plenty of time in the future to uphold grooming and dress , and that surely student years were designed for rebellion , my host gave a " we know what 's coming next " tolerant look and , ever so politely , explained there were plenty of other schools for that , and this was a @entity8 school for those who wanted to live the @entity8 way of life			1
an @entity148 life : @entity44 without sound bites living the @entity8 way of life is central to this school			2
at @entity10 there is a lot of hand holding ( between men and women only ) , with chaste kisses and long looks			1
i know that @entity8 beliefs forbid pre-marital sex , but somehow i imagined that meant no relationships , and by extension , no physical contact			0
by now i was realizing i was the victim of my own preconceptions and prejudices about this faith and its worshippers			0
' i 'm 92 ... of course i will vote ! ' and then the penny dropped			0
having probably spent their youth in the minority -- depending on where they grew up -- for many @entity10 students this was the first time they were in the majority , the norm ! they need n't explain why they did n't drink alcohol , swear or want to wear ripped jeans with their butts hanging out			1
at @entity10 everyone knew why , and believed the same as they did			1
far from being restricting , this homogeny was their freedom to be as they wanted to be			0
@entity194 's 19th century wisdom for 21st century problem but there were moments when i wondered what sort of life experience these students would gain here			1
and i wondered , what it might be like for the person who discovered they were gay and wanted to explore their sexuality ; or the student who became pregnant or fell by the wayside and lapsed into drink or drugs			0
what would it be like for someone who felt like they did n't fit in ? i enjoyed my visit to @entity10			1
my host was completely charming throughout and happy to take all my impertinent questions in good humor			0
what struck me most was this was a college which , on the face of it , looked so familiar and yet underneath was a world apart from any school i had seen before .			2
