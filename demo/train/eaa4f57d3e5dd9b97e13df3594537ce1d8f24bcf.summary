-- back when @entity1 only had millions of users instead of a billion , before @entity3 and the bungled ipo and outrage over privacy issues , people " poked " each other on the social network			1
the poke , which is still around but rarely used , is a minimalistic form of communication -- the digital equivalent of a head nod or wink			0
now the social network has expanded the poke into a standalone @entity19 app , which was released on friday			1
the simple free app , called @entity1 , allows you to send fleeting messages , pokes , photos and 10 - second videos to @entity1 friends			1
the messages expire after a set period of time , from 1 to 10 seconds , and can not be retrieved by either party again			2
this makes the app perfect for sending salacious images without leaving a trail			2
" with the @entity1 app , you can poke or send a message , photo , or video to @entity1 friends to share what you 're up to in a lightweight way , " says @entity1 in a blog post announcing the new app. when you open the app , you can choose from a set of icons at the bottom of the screen to send a poke , type a 120 - character message , open the camera to snap a picture ( you can not choose an existing photo from your camera roll , but you can add fun doodles or text on top of the picture you do take ) , or shoot a 10 - second video			1
decide how long you want the other person to see your message or photo ( 1 , 3 , 5 or 10 seconds ) , add a location if you like , then choose one or more of your @entity1 friends from the list and hit send			1
to view a message , tap and hold until the little countdown clock in the corner runs down , and the message is gone forever			0
you can see a list of who send you messages , but not view them again			2
the app poke shamelessly imitates is @entity75 , a photo and video - sharing service that has surged in popularity over the past year year			1
it 's no mystery why @entity1 is jumping on the temporary message bandwagon			2
@entity75 says it has millions of users who send around 50 million messages a day			1
it is also popular with the highly valuable younger age group , though it does n't currently have ads or any other way of making money off of its service			0
the @entity1 app is also ad - free for the time being			1
the allure of self - destructing messages is that they are unlikely to be seen by anyone other than the recipient , or to resurface during a campaign for public office			0
snapchat has earned a reputation as a tool for sending @entity105 © photos , though its also handy for funny or silly images for friends			2
because of the private nature of these messages , the apps have built - in safeguards			0
the only way to keep a copy of a photo on these apps is to take a screenshot with your phone			0
both @entity119 and @entity75 warn the sender when the recipient has grabbed a screenshot of their message			0
@entity1 seems keenly aware of how the @entity119 app will be used by most people			1
" if you ever see something you 're uncomfortable with , you can click the gear menu and report it , " says the company in the post			0
in the app 's help center there are instructions for what to do when someone takes a screenshot against your will			0
that section helpfully links to a post on what to do when an adult is making you uncomfortable , and another on what to do when someone requests nude photos			0
the app is @entity1 's fifth @entity19 app , joining the main @entity1 app , @entity150 and @entity151 .			1

@entity1 has released a new , free app for @entity19 called @entity1
it lets users *discreetly* send messages , photos and videos that are *deleted* in a few seconds
the @entity1 app is inspired by the @entity75 app , which is often used to send *sexual* images
