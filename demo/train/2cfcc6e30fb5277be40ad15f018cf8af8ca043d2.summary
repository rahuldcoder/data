six months after more than 200 @entity4 schoolgirls vanished into the night , the # @entity1 campaign has faded			1
when the social media phenomenon of signs asking for the release of the missing girls took off in may , celebrities like first lady @entity6 and @entity8 recipient @entity7 posted their photos , joining people from around the world			1
but as weeks became months and prospects of the schoolgirls ' release seemed slim , the social media campaign slowly dwindled			1
but one man , @entity20 , did not stop fighting to bring the missing girls home			1
almost every day , for 186 days , the @entity25 , @entity24 resident took a photo of himself holding up a sign pleading with the world not to forget about the @entity4 schoolgirls			1
a father of three and marketing professional , @entity20 felt a responsibility to advocate for the missing girls and their families			1
now , @entity24 has reached a ceasefire agreement with the @entity36 terror group @entity35 , which took credit for kidnapping the girls back in april			1
the girls are expected to be released shortly , although @entity24 government spokesman @entity40 says " it is a process			1
... it is not a question of hours and days			2
" with the end of the kidnapping ordeal in sight , @entity20 shares with @entity2 why he did n't give up hope when so many others did			2
@entity2 : when you first started taking photos , did you know you were going to take a photo everyday ? @entity20 : i never knew i would still be carrying the @entity1 placard six months after the schoolgirls were abduction			1
i had thought , the girls would be back soon , especially when a couple of countries were pledging support to help rescue them			0
day 20 was when i started taking photos because it was so shocking and heartbreaking			0
now we 're up to day 186 and the story is the same , the girls are still not back			2
@entity2 : what inspired you to keep participating in the # @entity1 campaign ? @entity20 : i believe the @entity4 parents whose children were abducted need our support during this agonizing time			1
i am a father of three kids			0
if i am away from my kids for two or three days , i always feel like there 's a vacuum			0
so , i felt like we must advocate for these parents			0
we must join our voices with theirs and demand for the safe return of their abducted children			0
@entity2 : did you tell others about what you were doing ? @entity20 : i did get awesome support from people all over the world through various social media platforms			1
they kept encouraging me to keep holding on , and to not give up when many others have since given up			0
@entity2 : how did the people in your community respond when the girls were first abducted ? @entity20 : initially , there were some who did n't believe such a thing could happen			1
some people just could n't fathom more than 200 innocent schoolgirls being violently taken all at once			0
the realization dawned on many when the government confirmed the abduction to be true			0
@entity2 : do you think people in your community still care ? @entity20 : the support for the parents of the abducted schoolgirls in my community is awesome			2
we are all united in our demand			0
we are asking and pleading with the @entity24 government to please do more to ensure the safe release of the abducted schoolgirls			2
@entity2 : what are your thoughts about the government 's effort to get the girls back ? @entity20 : i believe @entity24 government has been doing everything possible within its limit to ensure the girls are safely rescued			1
but i believe , the government could do a lot more better than what it has been doing			0
six months after the kidnappings , we are now hearing about negotiations for the release of the missing schoolgirls			0
but we have lost some valuable time in the process			0
@entity2 : is the community hopeful that the schoolgirls will be returned ? @entity20 : everyone is anticipated , expectant and praying it is true			2
some are waiting to pop champagne			0
@entity2 : do you think the girls will ever get rescued ? @entity20 : fingers are crossed that hopefully the girls would be reunited with their families			1
i am hopeful , and i believe that one day , the girls would be freed			2
this belief has never changed , not once .			0
