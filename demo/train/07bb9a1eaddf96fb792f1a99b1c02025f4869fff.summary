@entity0 -- today , @entity2 lives a peaceful life with his family as a civil engineer in @entity6 , @entity7			2
but things could easily be very different			0
@entity2 believes that had he not fled his homeland as a refugee , he would likely number among the @entity12 baha'is facing years behind bars simply for working to provide younger members of their community a tertiary education			1
" if myself and my wife were there , we would be imprisoned , " he said			0
@entity2 , 31 , is a member of the @entity11 , @entity12 's largest religious minority with an estimated 300,000 members			1
considered by the ruling clergy to be apostates , @entity11 have been persecuted in @entity12 since the faith arose there in the mid- 19th century			1
its members are systematically denied access to higher education in the @entity31 today , says @entity32			1
read : for @entity34 educators , a lesson in power from @entity12 " people apply for university and their applications are turned down , even though they have strong results from secondary school , " said @entity37 , @entity12 specialist for @entity38			1
" they ca n't get credentials , so they 're barred from pursuing all sorts of professions			0
they ca n't be doctors , lawyers , university professors or scientists			0
" in response , @entity11 have improvised a decentralized , semi-underground college known as the @entity54 ( @entity54 )			1
since 1987 , @entity54 has run classes in the living rooms and kitchens of @entity11 homes , on the sweat of volunteer @entity11 professors , many of whom lost their jobs in @entity12 universities over their religious beliefs			1
according to @entity68 , founder of a campaign to support @entity12 's @entity11 in their quest for higher education , the college has produced about 2,000 graduates , one - in - ten of whom have gone on to postgraduate study abroad at one of 60 universities outside @entity12 recognizing @entity54 coursework			1
" it 's a creative solution to a real dilemma , " said @entity68			2
" these are very resilient people			0
" in may , more than 30 @entity11 homes across @entity12 were raided as part of a crackdown on @entity54			1
the institution was subsequently declared illegal , according to human rights groups , and seven professors and administrators were last month sentenced to four and five years each , for being involved in an illegal group intending to commit crimes against national security			2
among them was @entity2 's academic adviser throughout his five years at @entity54 , @entity92			0
" it 's unbelievable , " said @entity2			0
" these are regular people , they 're not anti-government			0
when the government blocks their education , they just find another way			0
now they 're arresting them because they found alternatives to the rights they were denied			0
" the global campaign against @entity12 's persecution of @entity11 in education is gathering momentum , with the screening of @entity108 , a documentary film on the issue at a number of @entity113 universities this month			1
@entity114 laureates archbishop @entity115 and @entity117 president @entity116 have signed an open letter calling on @entity12 to unconditionally drop the charges against the @entity11 educators			1
" [ @entity123 ] t is particularly shocking when despots and dictators in the 21st century attempt to subjugate their own populations by attempting to deny education , " it reads			0
the letter also calls on academics around the world to register their disapproval with their @entity12 peers , and consider recognizing @entity54 coursework or offering scholarships			2
read : @entity11 accuse @entity12 of stoking hatred in media @entity12 's persecution of @entity11 is not limited to the educational sector , according to human rights groups			1
seven @entity11 religious leaders are currently imprisoned for crimes including " espionage for @entity143 , " " insulting religious sanctities " and " propaganda against the system , " according to @entity32			1
the organization considers the @entity11 leaders to be prisoners of conscience , and says their convictions are politically motivated			2
it says baha'is are not permitted to meet , hold religious ceremonies or practice their religion with other believers within @entity12			1
nor are @entity11 the only group excluded from higher education in @entity12			1
human rights activists , supporters of women 's rights , members of the political opposition and student journalists have also been deliberately denied access to education , according to a recent report by the non-governmental organization @entity167			2
@entity168 , spokesman for @entity12 's mission to the @entity170 , said that while the @entity11 was not recognized as an official religion in @entity12 , its adherents had full civil rights			1
" contrary to allegations made by supporters of the cult abroad , they have had equal access to universities and every year tens of them are graduated from @entity12 universities , " he said			1
@entity168 said raids on @entity54 had been conducted because those involved in the institution had " systematically controlled activities of cult members , and ... interfered in their private , social and economic lives			2
" he said the organization also had the goal of " entrapping " @entity190 , with the ultimate objective of creating " an extremist cult movement			0
" he said those arrested in the raids had been given a fair trial , and had exercised their right of appeal			0
@entity68 , the @entity108 campaign 's founder , said the fact that @entity54 produced " brilliant students " seemed to be viewed by the @entity12 government as an affront			1
former bihe student @entity204 recently completed a phd in physics at @entity207 , and is now a post-doctoral researcher at the @entity209 , @entity209			0
he left @entity12 in 2000 after completing a five - year civil engineering course at @entity54			1
" by the time i was a teenager , i understood that as a baha'i i was going to be banned from going to any college or university in the country , " he said			0
" the price of being a @entity11 was very high in those days			2
" two years after @entity204 began his studies , @entity2 enrolled in the same course			0
his university enrollment applications had been rejected , despite his strong grades in high school			0
the university applications required him to state his religion , but only gave four options , none of which were the @entity11			2
with no declared religion , his applications were considered incomplete			0
after graduating , @entity2 struck further challenges			0
he was paid a lower salary because he lacked a recognized qualification , and was removed from several projects when clients objected to a @entity11 's involvement			1
when his wife , who had trained for six years as a pharmacist , encountered similar issues , they decided to leave for @entity238 , and were granted asylum in the @entity113 in 2006			0
" we could n't put up with it any more , " he said			0
before he left , @entity2 had fulfilled the obligation expected of @entity54 graduates , repaying the institution by voluntarily teaching a first - year physics class			2
" you do n't just finish @entity54 and go , you stay and help future generations , " he said			0
he finds it astonishing that he could be arrested , like so many others in his community , for the " crime " of bringing education to young @entity11			1
" my former classmates face being arrested every day -- over education , " he said			2

the @entity11 -- @entity12 's largest religious minority -- are systematically excluded from higher education
in response , @entity11 have improvised an *informal* , semi-underground college since 1987
@entity12 's raid on the institution earlier this year has prompted an international outcry
