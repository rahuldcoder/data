-- @entity2 's book rollout hit some speed bumps last week			1
she took some partisan heat for a comment that she recently made to @entity7 's @entity6			1
@entity8 explained that she and her husband were " dead broke " when they left the @entity11 because of the legal fees they faced			1
her critics instantly jumped on the statement , pointing to these words as evidence that she was out of touch with average @entity20			2
it could be seen as the first major gaffe in a campaign for president in 2016 that has not even begun			2
her opponents argued that the statement was disingenuous , given the kind of money the @entity30 have earned , and showed that she lacked a kind of veracity			2
as @entity33 wrote in the @entity34 : " here is an iron - clad rule of @entity20 politics : if you are a millionaire with multiple houses , never , under any circumstances , discuss your financial struggles			2
you do n't have any financial struggles			1
" @entity8 clarified the comment , saying she and @entity8 were " obviously blessed " and that " i fully appreciate how hard life is so for many @entity20 today			1
" in another exchange that drew notice , an @entity49 interview with @entity50 , the popular host of " @entity51 , " @entity8 was clearly testy and sharp when the host asked her why it took so long for her to come out in favor of same - sex marriage			2
gaffes are a major part of the political game			1
gaffes are moments when a candidate slips , and the slip explodes into a major story that might harm a candidacy			1
they have been a central feature in the age of televised campaigns since the 1960s			2
reporters cover campaigns like horse races , more interested in the apparent ups and downs of each candidate than they are in the broader economic and political forces shaping elections or in the big public policy questions of the day			1
@entity78 : @entity79 play into @entity2 's hands gaffes play well in this kind of coverage because they offer instances when it seems as if there will be a dramatic shift in which horse has the lead			1
as @entity95 wrote in @entity96 : " ( @entity97 ) ince very little changes in the horse race from day to day , the main device they ( reporters ) have to drive the narrative is the gaffe			1
the gaffe is a candidate saying something unplanned and unwelcome			1
as campaign reporters define their job , the gaffe is the primary form of ' news			0
' " @entity8 joins a long line of candidates who have made these kinds of mistakes			0
there are different kinds of gaffes , which is probably what helps make them interesting to some			1
there are gaffes where candidates make statements that just sound wrong , raising questions about their intelligence and political acumen			1
in 1967 , the charismatic and dashing @entity126 gov. @entity125 justified his initial support of @entity128 to a reporter as a result of " brainwashing " by the military during a visit to @entity128			0
the statement , meant to explain the propaganda that many @entity20 had been hearing , came across as someone who lived in the world of movies rather than the world of politics			0
during a 1976 debate with democrat @entity144 , @entity79 president @entity142 said , " there is no @entity147 domination of @entity148			0
" the statement was meant to show that the president did n't agree with conservative critics who said his foreign policy detente -- easing relations with the @entity147 -- indicated an acceptance of communism			1
but it came off as if he did n't know much about foreign policy			1
vice presidential candidate @entity158 made an endless series of these kinds of gaffes in television interviews in 2008 with @entity163 , when she seemed to have trouble explaining some very basic facts about foreign or domestic policy			1
when @entity163 asked her about statements that @entity169 's proximity to @entity170 was evidence of her foreign policy expertise , @entity158 said , " our next - door neighbors are foreign countries , there in the state that i am in the executive of			1
" she added , " as @entity180 rears his head and comes into the airspace of the @entity20 , where do they go ? it 's @entity169			1
" then there are those gaffes where a candidate says something that just falls flat , even if it is not necessarily inaccurate			1
in 1988 , @entity189 candidate @entity188 responded to a question about whether he would want the death penalty if his wife was raped and murdered			1
he said , " i think you know that i 've opposed the death penalty all of my life			0
" although the @entity198 governor was trying to demonstrate his commitment to this policy position , his response seemed cold and distant			0
in 2000 , vice president @entity201 claimed responsibility for having helped to invent the @entity203			0
republicans went to town , using this as evidence that @entity201 was willing to say anything , though the vice president was referring to his involvement with legislation that was actually vital in the evolution of modern communications technology			0
sometimes a statement plays into negative perceptions that voters have about a candidate			1
at a supermarket visit during the 1992 campaign , @entity218 's words made him appear stunned by a electronic scanner , conveying the impression that he was out of touch with average @entity20			1
( the @entity11 claimed he was just impressed with a new kind of scanner			0
) he also admitted during a debate that he did n't know the price of milk			2
when events change , a statement that seems reasonable at one moment can appear devastating the next			0
in 1972 , democrat @entity232 said that he was " one thousand percent " behind his running mate @entity233 , after @entity233 revealed that he had received electric shock treatment			0
but @entity232 's team soon felt it was necessary to drop @entity233 from the ticket , making the statement seem quite problematic			2
democrats pounced on sen. @entity240 in 2008 for saying that the fundamentals of the economy were sound as the financial markets imploded in the middle of the campaign			0
there are also physical gaffes , which are less about what candidates say than about how they look			2
when @entity253 @entity252 appeared to be crying as he responded to unfavorable stories about his wife in 1972 , the perception of weakness seemed to harm his front - runner status			0
when @entity258 , a former college football player , stumbled on the stairs of an airplane , the fall became the butt of a joke on " @entity264 " that came to symbolize his clumsiness			0
( @entity267 had always joked that @entity258 , then in the @entity11 , could not " fart and chew gum at the same time			0
" ) when @entity188 wore a military helmet in a photo op , sitting in a tank , to show his support for the military , @entity79 used this awkward image to highlight his weakness on defense			0
when @entity218 glanced at his watch in the middle of a debate with @entity8 in 1992 , it showed a president who was not engaged with the entire campaign			0
when @entity286 gov. @entity285 yelled enthusiastically after a third place finish in @entity288 in 2004 , the clip was shown again and again and used as evidence that he was somehow unstable			0
when @entity198 democrat @entity290 went windsurfing off @entity291 , with his sailboard twisting and turning different ways with the wind , @entity79 played the image as evidence that he goes back and forth on the issues			0
" @entity290 , whichever way the wind blows , " the narrator says			0
in a 2000 debate , @entity201 's entire physical demeanor -- the way he walked toward @entity302 at one point in the debate and frequently sighed -- conveyed a kind of arrogance that played into perceptions of him as an aloof @entity310 liberal			1
there are also the gaffes when candidates are caught saying something that was not meant to be public			2
when an @entity317 user captured @entity318 at a 2012 fund - raiser talking about the " 47 % " of @entity20 who were dependent on government and do n't pay taxes and would n't support him , it was used as an example of his elitism			2
when sen. @entity326 of @entity327 in 2006 used the racial slur a " macaca " while someone was taping him , some said it instantly tanked his candidacy			0
but do these gaffes really matter ? do they turn a campaign ? according to a recent book by the political scientists @entity337 and @entity338 , " @entity339 , " journalists tend to greatly overstate how important gaffes are			1
the fundamentals of campaigns -- the state of the economy , fund - raising capacity , endorsements -- are in the end much more important than moments like these , which seem big at the time			0
" many a news cycle , " @entity352 wrote in his blog , " was built on a ' gaffe ' with a remarkably short shelf life			0
" when @entity359 was recorded in the middle of the 2008 primaries making a statement about @entity20 who cling to their guns and religion , it stimulated a feeding frenzy but did n't kill his candidacy			2
given the fast - paced nature of the modern press , the odds are that stories will die very quickly			0
so if a candidate can hold on long enough , the frenzy around a gaffe will probably disappear			2
the way in which gaffes usually matter has less to do with make - or - break moments than with how they help to build a broader narrative about how voters view a candidate			1
gaffes become devastating only when they play into deeper weaknesses in a candidate that were there regardless of the missteps themselves			1
the gaffe can also become damaging as a very small piece of a larger story that @entity20 develop about a specific candidate			2
the biggest risk from a statement like @entity2 's has to do with concerns about how genuine she is and whether she is more a product of @entity394 than @entity395			1
this will certainly be a story that her opponents will repeat in months to come			0
but , at this point , she should n't worry too much that this gaffe will matter			1
usually candidates survive these stumbles			0
@entity8 brings a tremendous amount to the table , in terms of her support among core democrats and female voters and her experience in the @entity11 , @entity410 and at the @entity411			0
if she can continue to build on those assets and meld them into a first - rate campaign , this statement will be quickly forgotten .			0

@entity417 : @entity2 's comment about being " dead broke " landed with a thud
he says gaffes tend to drive a lot of media coverage of politicians
vast majority of gaffes do n't have a significant lasting impact , he says
@entity417 : when gaffes do matter , it 's because they *reinforce* perceptions of candidate 's flaws
