-- an airliner vanishes over the waters of a @entity4 ocean			1
there 's no distress call , no wreckage , nothing but water and questions			0
so far , the story of @entity12 sounds remarkably similar to that of @entity14 , which remains missing nearly 10 months after it disappeared from radar screens on a flight between @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19			1
but it is n't , analysts say			2
here are four ways the two incidents appear to differ : 1			0
there 's not anywhere near as much intrigue			0
when @entity14 disappeared , the plane 's identifying transponders appeared to be intentionally shut off , its pilots stopped making radio transmissions and the airliner made a mysterious turn before possibly traveling for hours until all traces vanished			1
concerns over hijackings and terror permeated that case , but so far they have n't come up in the @entity12 case			1
" in this case you had normal communications with the pilot , a line of weather that appeared to be pretty difficult , severe , and he was asking to climb as high as he could to get out of it , " said @entity40 , an aviation expert and former @entity42 official			2
what role did weather play ? 2			0
the water is much shallower and a commonly used shipping channel , making wreckage easier to find			2
the area where @entity14 is believed to have gone down features extraordinarily deep water			1
it 's also relatively mysterious -- the seabed had never been charted in some places , making getting a fix on the plane 's pingers very difficult			1
in the @entity12 case , if the plane went down in the water , it likely rests in no more than a few hundred feet of heavily traveled ocean , making the task of locating and recovering it much simpler , analysts say			1
airlines and governments have learned a lot since @entity14			1
in the hours after the @entity73 jetliner vanished in march , confusion reigned			2
when officials spoke at all , the information was often contradictory or confusing , and families of passengers and crew complained about how they were treated			0
in this case , both government and airline officials appear to be striking a more appropriate tone			2
families of @entity12 flight passengers given support through the ' nightmare ' @entity12 ceo @entity92 tweeted that his " only thought " was the passengers and crew and pledged to do " whatever we can			1
" @entity18 defense minister @entity95 also tweeted his support : " i will be there with you , " he said			0
and the search appears to be getting off to a more efficient start			0
@entity102 officials quickly posted a search plan , indicating ships from its navy , as well as assets from @entity18 , @entity108 and @entity109 , were being called to help			0
@entity0 's @entity110 said the way @entity92 is handling the crisis is notable			0
" what he 's doing is something that @entity73 did not do in the initial hours , the initial days and weeks , which is being very transparent , acknowledging this is a terrible situation , " @entity110 said			2
" in this case , it appears as though the airline and the authorities are in sync , and they really are putting the families first , which is the way to do it			0
we almost certainly wo n't be searching for this plane in 10 months			0
with a more precise fix on where the plane was when it lost contact , a smaller search area and shallower seas , the airliner almost certainly will be much easier to find , said @entity132 , former director of the @entity134 's @entity133			1
it 's " very unlikely that we 're going to see anything remotely close to what we saw with @entity18 370 , " he said			0
" it will not surprise me if this airplane is found in the next 12 hours of daylight , because they know to a fairly high degree of certainty where it was , the water is 150 feet deep as opposed to 10 - or 20,000 feet deep in the @entity145			1

@entity12 *investigation* unlikely to be as *frustrating* as @entity14 case , analysts say
for one , @entity12 disappeared over shallower , more heavily traveled waters
@entity12 disappearance is lacking many of the mysterious *hallmarks* of @entity14 case
experts expect plane will be found soon , maybe in next 12 hours of daylight
