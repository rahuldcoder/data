@entity0 -- one of the key issues the next generation of @entity5 's leaders will have to consider when they take the reins in november is whether to let social media continue to develop as an increasingly important force in shaping government policy			1
early signs are strong that @entity11 will encourage or at least tolerate the growth of microblogging sites like @entity14 , and instant messaging services like @entity16 , which have been allowed to develop relatively unfettered despite their potential to become breeding grounds for critical public debate over social issues			2
@entity11 is quickly realizing these fast - developing social media can be an important way to get public feedback on social issues as @entity5 goes through a wide range of growing pains in its transformation from a planned to a more market - oriented economy			2
equally important , @entity11 also understands that social media can be an important tool for getting out the @entity32 's own message as it tries to show an increasingly restless public it is hearing their concerns			2
the rise of social media in @entity5 has been anything but smooth and tolerant over the last five years , as big names like @entity41 and @entity42 soared to global prominence on their ability to let millions of people around the world connect and interact in new ways based on factors like personal interests and social background			2
both @entity41 and @entity42 were gaining a nascent foothold in @entity5 with their ground - breaking services when an uneasy @entity11 abruptly blocked their sites in 2009			1
people power a sign of times in @entity5 's internet age no official reason was ever given , as is always the case when propaganda officials take such actions ; but the timing of the move just before the 20th anniversary of the @entity64 crackdown led many to suspect that @entity11 was worried the sites could become hotbeds for debate and discussion on a highly sensitive matter that to this day is banned from all @entity5 media , both traditional and new			1
the blockage of both @entity42 and @entity41 continues to this day , reflecting @entity11 's clear unease at letting average @entity5 form online communities through sites that are based outside @entity5 and therefore do n't have to play by the country 's strict self - censorship rules			1
by comparison , @entity11 has become more comfortable letting homegrown , @entity5 - based sites with names like @entity14 , @entity83 and @entity84 fill a demand from average @entity5 for social networking services over the desktop internet and increasingly via smartphones			0
unlike the big offshore - based names , domestic players , and anyone operating a @entity5 - based service for that matter , must follow @entity11 's strict self - censorship rules and immediately remove any content banned by central propaganda officials or risk big fines and even closure			0
the homegrown @entity5 services have had to walk a difficult tightrope as they tried to build commercial services while waiting for @entity11 to take a clear stance on how much it was willing to tolerate in the world of online public debate			0
@entity11 initially took a line of relative tolerance , only to slam on the brakes periodically when angry debate started getting out of control during discussion of sensitive topics like the high - speed rail crash in @entity113 last year that left more than 30 dead and 200 injured			0
@entity11 's growing unease with the situation came to a head in late 2011 when it ordered social networking sites to register all of their users with their real names			0
@entity5 's ' @entity42 ' introduces contracts to curb rumors the controversial policy was theoretically designed to limit rumor mongering , but many suspected it was actually a form of intimidation aimed at limiting public debate from people who liked to express their views under the protection of anonymity			1
but despite its draconian nature , that policy was never strictly enforced as @entity11 appeared to ultimately stand aside and let social networking sites implement their own less - drastic measures to limit rumor mongering and other controversial behavior			0
around the same time , @entity11 also started sending a set of completely opposite signals through traditional state - run media that openly praised the new social media sites			0
that campaign saw publication of a series of articles praising the sites as a powerful tool for government and other state - controlled agencies to issue regular updates on their activities and get feedback on new initiatives and steps they were taking to address public concerns			0
this hot - and cold approach probably reflects @entity11 's initial lack of understanding of the power of social media , followed by its growing level of comfort as it realizes the medium 's potential as a valuable and also controllable tool to understand and address public concerns			1
while it 's too early to say what approach the new leadership will take , the absence of a broader crackdown in the space , a practice often seen at this kind of politically sensitive time , means the current atmosphere of relative tolerance is likely to continue as @entity11 learns the importance of accurately gauging public opinion and responding accordingly to people 's concerns .			1

@entity11 blows hot and cold on social media and its role as a forum for public debate
home - grown sites like @entity14 are valued as a controllable tool
@entity41 , @entity42 remain blocked amid fears they could become hotbeds of *dissent*
current atmosphere of relative tolerance is likely to continue under @entity5 's new leaders
