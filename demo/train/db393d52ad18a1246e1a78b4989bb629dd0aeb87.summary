@entity0 -- prosecution witnesses at the trial of capt. @entity4 painted a picture of chaos aboard the @entity8 on the night the cruise liner sank , as they testified tuesday in @entity10			1
the cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off @entity10 's @entity12 in the @entity13 in january 2012 , killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board			1
interactive : how ill - fated cruise liner was raised from @entity18 seabed @entity19 faces charges of manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board			1
among several key witnesses tuesday , on the second day of prosecution testimony against @entity19 , was @entity30 dancer @entity4 , who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge at the time of the accident			1
@entity36 , who boarded the ship as a passenger but had worked on another @entity40 ship captained by @entity19 a few weeks earlier , conceded under questioning that she had been romantically involved with him			2
everything seemed normal at first on the bridge , she told the court , but then she heard @entity19 giving orders , and then " speaking angrily , yelling , to another officer " and telling him to obey the order			0
she heard the alarms go off on the bridge , triggering chaos and confusion			2
she heard a call from the engine room that " water had entered the ship			0
" the dancer left the bridge with @entity19 and crew member @entity59 , she said , following them around the vessel because she was n't sure where they were going			1
they ended up near some lifeboats , where " it was very slippery , " she said			0
she and @entity59 helped other passengers for about half an hour while the captain returned to the bridge , she said			1
then @entity59 pulled her into a lifeboat that also held other crew members			1
the boat hung over the side , and some panicked passengers fell into the water , she said			0
@entity36 said she has suffered psychological issues and taken medication to deal with the mass media attention after the wreck			0
she is also a party to the civil case against the captain			0
disappointed by captain 's actions @entity59 , who had dined with the pair , earlier told the court he was disappointed by @entity19 's handling of events during and after the accident			1
under cross-examination , @entity59 was quizzed about @entity19 's movements around the cruise liner and about how they both came to leave the ship			1
@entity59 gave the same account as @entity19 has given -- that the ship was falling on top of them and that they had no choice but to " fall " into a lifeboat			1
the defense also asked about @entity19 's demeanor when he saw him on shore and whether or not the captain was trying to get back to the ship			1
the prosecution also focused on why @entity19 decided to sail so close to the island 's rocky coastline			1
another witness , ship 's maitre d ' @entity113 , a @entity12 resident , said he had asked the captain to do the " flyby " a week earlier -- and he acknowledged feeling guilty about having done so			1
he testified that @entity19 had told him that he was going to do a " close passage to the island " on the day of the crash , and that the captain had invited him on to the bridge so he could see it			1
@entity113 messaged his sister on @entity123 to tell her the ship would be passing by moments before the accident			0
he was planning to point out where his house was on @entity12 to @entity19 and other guests on the bridge			1
' it is going to end up in the rocks ' @entity19 asked him to call a retired @entity40 captain , @entity132 , who lived on @entity12 to say they 'd be passing close by , @entity113 said			1
@entity132 was not on the island that night , but he and @entity19 spoke by telephone			0
@entity113 told the court that he had done previous " close passages to the island , " but none that close			0
@entity19 had to ask the @entity40 company before changing his route and had done so before on a previous voyage , @entity36 said			0
@entity132 , who took the stand after @entity36 , described @entity19 as insincere and always hiding the truth , adding that he did not respect him			0
the retired captain said he had been surprised to get a call from @entity113 and then schettino that evening because it was winter , so there were few people on @entity12 to see the " salute , " or close passage to the shore			1
@entity19 had asked him on the call about the waters around the island , he said			0
@entity132 said a friend had then rung him , who said , " i saw a ship passing by so close , it is going to end up in the rocks ... i 've never seen a ship passing by so close			1
" @entity132 said there was no set procedure for doing a " salute " and that the cruise line had never asked him to do one to publicize the brand			0
he 'd done them only for his own sense of pride and seamanship , he said -- and always in summer and never with any " risky maneuvers			0
" plates , glasses flying @entity113 testified that after the ship hit the rocks and alarms started blaring , he ran down to the restaurant to check the situation			2
he found a scene of chaos -- terrified passengers , with plates , food and glasses on the floor as the ship listed			2
the maitre d ' told the court he left panicked elderly passengers in safe places where they would n't be hit by flying plates			0
he heard a message from the loudspeakers that the ship was suffering a blackout but did not hear the coded message for crew members only to prepare for emergency , @entity113 said			2
once the general alarm was sounded , he and other crew members started preparing lifeboats so those on board could abandon ship , he said			2
he described lifting a man on crutches onto his back to carry him to safety			0
questioned by the defense , the maitre d ' said he 'd crawled down a ladder to jump on the roof of a lifeboat on the ship 's upright side			1
@entity113 said he met the island 's deputy mayor climbing onto the ship to save passengers , which could undermine @entity19 's argument that he could not get back on board after " falling " into the lifeboat			2
hero or villain ? the trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses , including passengers , crew members and islanders , who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated			2
@entity19 argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people , not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32			2
his defense is trying to prove , among other things , that the ship 's watertight doors did not function properly , and that is the reason the ship sank , leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation			1
the captain also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman turned it in the direction that @entity19 told him to 13 seconds before impact			2
the helmsman , @entity256 , and four others were convicted in a plea deal in july for their role in the disaster			0
a @entity262 court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements			0
