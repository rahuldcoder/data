too bad @entity0 is n't running for office in @entity2			1
the real one , that is			2
he 's so popular here that at least 16 candidates for municipal elections have adopted the name " @entity0 " to try to get more votes on october 7			1
there are plenty of " baracks , " as well as " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " and even " @entity15 , " which literally translates as " @entity16			2
" and it does n't stop with the @entity19 president			2
as candidates try to stand out , ballots are filled with the names of characters like @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
and there are even some oddball characters like gyrating dancers , @entity31 and a " @entity32 " who says he 'll " blow up corruption			1
" the candidates dress in costumes during their short electoral spots , hoping to grab the attention of would - be voters			1
they were inspired after a popular tv clown became the most - voted - for contender in the last congressional elections			1
for some , the eccentric candidates are a sign of political immaturity ; but for others , they 're proof that @entity2 's democracy is flourishing			1
@entity2 are surprisingly laid back when it comes to politics and questions of authority			2
everyone from football players to presidents go by their first names or nicknames			1
the most popular leader in recent history , former president @entity57 , ran for office on his nickname " @entity57 , " which can be translated as " @entity61			2
" the current president , @entity62 , is simply called " @entity62 " by most @entity2			0
in fact , more than 140 candidates for municipal elections have adopted the name " dilma " for the ballot			2
one of the @entity0 candidates has another explanation for many of the bizarre names adopted during elections			1
" there is so much corruption in politics that people sometimes prefer to vote for a candidate who is n't a real person , " said @entity74			0
he 's running for councilman in the central @entity2 city of @entity83 with the name " @entity85			0
" for the last couple of years , he has worked as a @entity0 impersonator at parties and events			1
but he says he 'll make a difference if he wins the election			0
" i used this name because i think it can bring me votes , " he told @entity92			0
" but i need to separate just being a body double from being a politician			0
" his platform , ironically , is health reform			0
he hands out pamphlets as he strolls around the center of the city with a big sash bearing the name " @entity85			0
" most passers - by seem more interested in getting their picture taken with " @entity0 " than reading about his campaign promises			1
" with that face and appearance , it 'll be hard to go wrong , " one man says			0
but others say looks are n't enough			0
" i 'll be open to his proposals , but politics are n't a joke , " another man says			0
@entity119 says he 's pretty sure no one has adopted the name of the @entity123 @entity19 presidential candidate			0
but if the @entity19 presidential elections do n't go to the real @entity0 , a few @entity124 may emerge the next time @entity2 go to the polls			1
opinion : @entity129 ideal stage to highlight planet 's survival			0
