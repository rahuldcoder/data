@entity0 , @entity1 -- three witnesses whose testimony could absolve a 14 - year - old @entity1 girl facing life in prison have changed their statements			1
it 's the latest twist in the case of @entity11 , a @entity12 teenager who was charged more than a month ago under @entity1 's blasphemy laws for allegedly burning pages of @entity16 's holy book for cooking fuel			1
she has denied the charges			2
the three witnesses initially told police they saw @entity21 , a @entity22 cleric , tear pages out of a copy of the @entity25 and put them with police evidence that led to the charges against @entity11			1
but they recanted those statements on monday at a bail hearing for the cleric , according to the imam 's lawyer , @entity31			1
a fourth witness stood by his initial statement			0
the witnesses are a critical part of the police investigation that determined last week that the imam framed the teen			1
based on that investigation and a lack of witnesses , her lawyers are now appealing to have the blasphemy charges dismissed			1
the teen 's case has sparked international outcry against the @entity1 government , with some saying the blasphemy laws are used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities			2
@entity0 's police chief accused the three witnesses of lying to the court on monday , and said investigators never pressured the witnesses when they gave their initial statements against the cleric			1
" if they have changed their statements , they are just lying , " chief @entity59 said			2
police arrested @entity11 in august after her neighbor accused her of burning quran pages to for cooking fuel , investigators said			1
the neighbor began to shout in protest , drawing a crowd that grew angry			0
some neighbors said the teenager was beaten			0
others said she ran back home and locked herself inside			0
when police arrived , they arrested her			2
@entity11 's lawyers said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with the girl because the two did n't get along			2
they said it 's likely that he liked the teen and she did n't feel the same			2
the lawyers say that no one actually saw @entity11 burning the papers , but that the neighbor went to @entity21 with the bags			2
according to police , @entity21 was n't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the @entity25 would be enough to convict @entity11 on blasphemy charges			1
so , he added two pages from the actual holy book to the bag to bolster the case , they said			2
in addition to charges of tampering with evidence , @entity21 could also face blasphemy charges as a result of the police investigation			1
the pursuit of the accusations against the cleric is significant in @entity1 because " never before has a false accuser been held accountable , " according to @entity107 , the @entity1 director of @entity108			0
after her arrest in august , @entity11 had been held in an adult jail before she was released on bail in september			0
a local court transferred her case to the juvenile court last week after the police investigation said she had been framed			1
@entity117 will consider the petition to drop the charges against @entity11 on october 17 , said @entity120 , the teen 's leading lawyer			1
if the charges are not dismissed , her case will proceed in juvenile court			1
having her case transferred to juvenile court " is a precursor to the case ending , " said @entity124			1
" that is quite unprecedented in the 25 - year history of @entity1 's blasphemy laws , " he said last week			0
it 's unclear how the change in statements from the key witnesses will affect her case			1
blasphemy laws were first instituted to keep peace between religions			0
actions perceived as insults to @entity16 provoke fierce reactions in the predominantly @entity22 nation , as demonstrated by the recent angry protests in response to an anti-islam film produced in the @entity147 and made available online			2
there have been 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986 , according to @entity108			0
there are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in @entity1 , and 52 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge , he said			0
@entity11 and her family spoke to @entity2 last month from an undisclosed location after she was released on bail			0
the teen denied that she defiled the @entity25			1
she said she was happy to be with her family , but feared for her life			0
" i 'm scared , " she said by phone			0
" i 'm afraid of anyone who might kill us			0
" no matter how her case pans out , it 's unclear what kind of life she might be able to have			0
aid groups in the @entity147 , @entity174 and @entity175 have offered the teen and her family a home outside @entity1 , a family representative said			0
but she has said she wants to stay in her home country .			0

witnesses initially said an imam framed a teen girl accused of burning @entity25 pages
now , three witnesses have recanted those statements made to police
based partly on those statements , police determined the teen is *innocent*
she still faces charges in juvenile court
