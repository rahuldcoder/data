@entity0 -- if president @entity4 's relationship with @entity6 speaker @entity5 was contentious in the past , he certainly was n't showing it while the two sat at the head table of a congressional lunch following monday 's inauguration			1
the two appeared to have a lighthearted exchange that prompted an apparent eye roll from first lady @entity15 , who was seated between them			1
was it something @entity5 said that prompted the reaction ? he tapped her shoulder while she ate her lunch			2
or was it something the clearly amused president said ? or maybe it was something both of them said			0
maybe it was her lunch			0
but because there 's no audio from the exchange , it 's hard to tell what prompted the reaction that caught fire on the @entity39			1
we thought we 'd leave it up to you			0
what do you think the first lady was thinking ? let us know in the comment section below			2
lessons in style from @entity15			0
