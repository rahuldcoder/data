-- organizers of the 2018 @entity3 @entity2 insist they have nothing to hide ahead of an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments			1
football 's world governing body @entity8 awarded the 2018 competition to @entity3 and the @entity11 to @entity12 in december 2010 , a decision which has been dogged by allegations of corruption and wrongdoing			1
@entity17 , a former @entity18 attorney , is head of the investigative arm of @entity8 's ethics committee and will visit all of the countries involved in the bidding process for the two tournaments , beginning in @entity23 next week			1
@entity17 has always insisted he is completely independent from @entity8 and would not hesitate to take action against president @entity25 or other top @entity8 officials if he found evidence that they broke the rules			2
the head of media for @entity3 2018 says the committee will co-operate fully with @entity17 's fact - finding investigation			1
" we can confirm the local organizing committee ( @entity36 ) will fully support mr @entity17 's work if he contacts us , " read a statement issued to @entity0			1
" the @entity3 2018 committee ran a bid campaign in full compliance with @entity8 rules and ethics , and we were awarded the right to host the @entity2 because of the unique and compelling proposition we put together			1
" the loc continues to conduct itself with exactly the same degree of transparency , commitment to excellence and spirit of fair play			0
" blog : can the @entity11 be moved ? how and where @entity17 's potential meeting with @entity3 takes place is open to question given in april he was one of 18 people barred from entering the country over what @entity58 said were human rights abuses , linked to the lawyer 's arrest and charging of @entity63 , a @entity3 , who is serving a 25 - year prison sentence in the @entity65 for arms trafficking			1
news of @entity17 's investigation came ahead of @entity8 's executive committee in @entity70 on thursday and friday where it will discuss the possibility of moving the 2022 tournament from the usual june and july slot to december			1
" i will conduct interviews in various places and i hope that those who have some information , even if they are not obliged to give me some , will agree to talk to me , " @entity17 told @entity74			2
" my goal is to submit a report that covers the @entity2 bidding and awarding process			0
" @entity84 , who will leave his post as chairman of the @entity87 at the end of the year , said @entity17 's task is n't easy			2
" he 's in a very awkward situation , " @entity84 told @entity0			0
" he has no police powers			0
he ca n't just walk into an office in @entity93 and say , ' i want these files and i want all your hard disks			0
' " he has to use the techniques of an international investigator and so the big question is , even if there 's evidence around , will he find it ? we do n't know			0
what i can do is make sure he gets the manpower and he gets the resources , the money , to run this			0
" @entity8 's decision to award @entity12 the 2022 tournament has been particularly criticized , with many suggesting the oppressive heat in the @entity114 state makes staging the @entity2 there impractical and dangerous			2
@entity84 himself said he had " serious doubts " about the procedure used to give @entity12 the event			2
moving the competition from the northern hemisphere summer to winter could present a number of problems to the sport 's major leagues and major broadcasters			1
" deals were signed for a summer @entity2 , " @entity128 reporter @entity127 told @entity129			0
in 2011 , @entity128 agreed to pay a record $ 425 million for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments			0
the three rival bidders beaten by @entity12 , the @entity65 , @entity133 and @entity134 and @entity135 , could file complaints with @entity138 authorities regarding the bidding process			1
moving the 2022 tournament from its traditional slot in the summer also potentially puts the @entity2 in competition with other major events such as the @entity143 , the @entity144 in tennis and the @entity146 ( @entity146 ) season in the @entity65			0

@entity3 2018 will fully co-operate with @entity17 's investigation
