-- once a racist , always a racist ? will bigots always be bigots ? or can people truly evolve over time for the better ? and if they do , should we applaud their metamorphosis and welcome them back ? the easy answer -- as we are seeing with @entity7 -- is to quickly label the person a racist for past insensitive remarks and cast her out to the fringes of society			1
but that 's not the best answer for our nation			2
i say this as a person who has been called racist slurs on numerous occasions			2
i 'm of @entity22 heritage			0
i have an inbox full of e-mails from people calling me things like " sand n --- - " or telling me " go back to where you are from			1
" ( which , i should note , is @entity30 )			0
i 'm also a @entity31 , and i do n't even want to describe here the litany of hate - filled insults that have been directed at our community and myself			0
the worst part is that these slurs do n't come just from ignorant bigots who can easily be dismissed , but often by elected officials and even religious leaders			0
but i will say this -- if a person who had called me a " sand n --- - " later expressed remorse and sincerely explained that they now understand it was hateful and wrong , i would n't respond with : " too bad , you 're a bigot for life			2
" do n't get me wrong , i would n't invite them over for dinner , either			0
however , i would cautiously applaud their change of heart and hope to see it evidenced by not just an apology , but by deeds as well			2
@entity57 : @entity7 should be forgiven and i would do this not just because they did the right thing by me , but also because they did the right thing by our society			1
they were evolving for the better and this in turn makes us a better nation			2
our country 's history is filled with examples of people 's views changing over time for the better -- the most recent example being on the issue of marriage equality			1
polls now show support for same - sex marriage is at between 51 and 58 %			0
but just 10 years ago , only slightly over 30 % of @entity80 supported it			0
if 10 years ago supporters of marriage equality dismissed all those who opposed gay marriage -- or who had even had used derogatory terms about gays -- as bigots incapable of evolving , we never would have seen the new acceptance of marriage equality by mainstream @entity80			1
we also witnessed @entity80 evolve for the better regarding interracial marriage			1
in 1967 , when the @entity80 @entity93 struck down laws that barred interracial marriage in the famous case of loving v. @entity97 , 73 % of @entity80 actually supported such laws			0
that was n't a @entity101 divide			0
the mainstream @entity80 view at that time was that blacks and whites should legally be prohibited from marrying each other			0
when did a majority of @entity80 finally begin to accept interracial marriage ? the late 1990s -- almost 30 years after the @entity93 's landmark decision			1
in tearful interview , @entity7 slams ' horrible lies ' @entity7 recently admission that she used the hateful " @entity113 " to describe a black man back inthe 1980 's			1
but could @entity7 -- as she has claimed -- have evolved over the past 30 years for the better ? it 's possible			1
former president @entity57 believes so , noting that @entity7 's programs in @entity116 , @entity117 , benefit " almost exclusively oppressed and poverty - stricken black people			1
" and as of the writing of this article , no one else has publicly come forward to say that @entity7 has used racially insensitive words in recent years			2
if she is still using racist and bigoted words , i would expect to see at least one other person substantiating such a claim			0
on the other hand , @entity7 's assertion on the " today " show earlier this week that she only used the " @entity113 " one time in her life is so ridiculous that i believe it made her situation even worse -- especially since at her recent deposition she appeared to admit having using it more times in the past			1
can @entity7 change ? of course she can , just as others have changed their views on issues of race and marriage equality			1
clearly it will take more than a few tears on a morning show and a disjointed apology to prove that to us			0
but in time , if she and others like her do evolve , we should applaud and embrace them			0
as the rev. @entity151 stated this week about @entity7 : " she should be reclaimed rather than destroyed			2
" certainly if someone is spouting racist , homophobic , anti-semitic or islamaphobic comments today , they deserve the punishment they receive -- be it losing their job of being cast from mainstream society to the fringes to wallow with the hate mongers			1
@entity7 and @entity164 food : critics say credit is past due but let 's not close the door on their redemption			1
if we do , our nation will be frozen in its progress forward on societal and racial issues			0
and that would truly be unforgivable			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity177 : can someone who is a bigot evolve ? and does society then forgive them ?
he says people call @entity7 a racist and cast her out ; that 's not good for society , though
he says history is full of viewpoints evolving for the better , such as on gay marriage
he says some of @entity7 's apology *implausible* , but public should be open to redemption
