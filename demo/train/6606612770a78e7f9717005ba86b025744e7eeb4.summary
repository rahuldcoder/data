-- @entity1 imagines a world where tiny clouds of information -- @entity6 statuses , business cards , @entity9 posts -- float above all of our heads			1
" augmented reality " can combine live video with data and information from the @entity16			1
in some ways , it 's not that far from reality			2
advancements in mobile phone technology have cleared the way for a coming wave of " augmented reality " applications that merge the physical world with information compiled about people and places on the @entity16			1
" when the technology gets there , this stuff could be amazingly useful and mildly terrifying in some ways , " said @entity1 , an associate professor at the @entity30 who has taught classes in augmented reality for a decade			1
the idea of pairing digital information with our real , @entity40 environments is not especially new -- think robot - human vision in the " @entity44 " movies			1
@entity1 even plodded about college campuses in the 1990s wearing a 40 - pound backpack and nerdy goggles , trying to make something similar happen			0
but as mobile phones become better equipped with gps systems , which use satellites to locate the phones ; compasses , which tell the direction the phone faces ; and accelerometers , which relay the device 's tilt ; the once - lofty idea of augmented reality is being put into the hands of consumers			1
last july in the @entity63 , a company called @entity64 released a mobile browser , @entity66 , that lets people see pieces of this new info - reality through their phone screens			1
a @entity66 user sets his or her phone to video mode , aims it around and sees all kinds of information pop up on the screen : blinking dots on apartments that are for sale , the values of those units , pull - down reviews of the bar up on the corner or details about sales at a nearby retail store			1
watch a video demo of the app this makes information easier to find and helps people make better sense of the physical world around them , said @entity97 , co-founder of @entity66			2
" i think it will actually get you out more than you would stay at home , " he said			0
" you 're not at your couch anymore , you 're not at your desk " when you need to find information			0
@entity66 , which bills itself as the first mobile browser that features augmented reality , is only available in the @entity63 and only on certain phones , including @entity109 , @entity111 's @entity110 and the @entity112			1
but @entity97 said the company plans to announce a global expansion plan on august 17 and will develop an app for the iphone if @entity117 changes policies that obstruct developers from creating such applications on that device			0
a range of other " ar " apps are in development or are on the market			1
one , called @entity127 , highlights subway routes in @entity129 and @entity130			0
@entity131 is an app that aims to show people encyclopedic information about nearby landmarks			0
like @entity137 , users can add information to the service			0
the idea could usher in an era of cell - phone tour guides			2
@entity143 , a @entity144 company , developed an app that makes @entity40 baseball players spring to life from baseball cards			0
users can turn the card to see their favorite players , through a phone screen , from all angles			2
and at @entity30 , researchers are working on video games that may one day make it look like virtual zombies are chasing players down real - world streets			1
@entity160 , ceo of @entity161 , a site that pairs @entity9 posts with geographical information , said he has developed an app that will let mobile phone users see their friends ' tweets through the video camera on their phones			1
he expects it to be available within the month			0
" it adds information to your world , and this is what it 's all about , " he said			0
to picture how that service would work , think about walking into your living room in the evening			0
if a roommate had posted to @entity9 from the couch , his or her @entity9 would hover in that space when viewed through a mobile phone 's video camera			1
@entity160 admits the model is a bit clunky for now			0
but he sees a future when the app will let people stand on a street corner , hold their phone up to their face , and see the @entity9 posts of crowd members as they mill about			1
phones would have to be able to communicate with satellites and computer services constantly , instead of only when someone posts a message , to make that possible , he said			2
" i see this being resolved in the near future , " he said , " because , really , it 's just a matter of really experimenting with this technology and pushing it to the limit			0
" but there are doubts about augmented technology on phones			2
@entity97 , of @entity66 , is concerned that augmented reality is being over-hyped and may create unrealistic expectations from consumers			1
" it 's a cool technology , but yeah , we need to see how much [ funding and visibility ] our companies will get , " he said			0
" it 's getting a lot of press now without being proven , but do we make money , are we going to make people happy with it ? we do n't know			0
" he added : " it 's like the first tv			0
we need to build an audience			0
" @entity1 , of @entity30 , said the technology behind today 's augmented reality apps is crude			1
mobile phone gps is n't nearly accurate enough to make sure a @entity9 post is tagged to a person , for instance , rather than the lamp post that 's 50 feet away			1
furthermore , the idea behind the information - reality mesh on mobile phones is off - base , he said			2
" i do n't see them answering a problem that needs to be solved , " added @entity1 , who believes two - dimensional maps can be used to display information much more easily with current technology			0
more functional problems exist as well			0
people do n't necessarily want to walk around the world holding cell - phone screens in front of their faces			2
and the world 's information has to be tagged geographically to make sense in an augmented - reality setting			2
but @entity1 does see a bright future for augmented reality			1
within a year , mobile phone applications will become much more functional , he said , and in the foreseeable future , augmented reality will move off of phone screens and onto futuristic sunglasses , whose wearers will see blips of information about everything around them , he said			1
if that happens , the " @entity44 " vision will have truly arrived .			0

" augmented reality , " a merger of the digital and virtual worlds , is coming to phones
" ar " apps put info -- like @entity9 posts -- on top of live video captured by phone
*smartphone* gps and compass systems paved the way for the advance
some say @entity280 is in its infancy ; others question its usefulness
