longer lines at airport checkpoints would result from eliminating a nearly $ 1 billion @entity5 program , the head of the @entity1 told a congressional committee thursday			1

@entity1 administrator @entity23 defended the program as an essential component of a web of protections			1
" if we remove one whole layer of security , that being @entity31 , who again are the least invasive and are looking for intent rather than items then that gives us an exposure to potential terrorists that we do n't currently have , " he said			2
government report slams @entity1 program to spot possible terrorists @entity41 also operate a program called @entity43 which evaluates passengers at the checkpoints and allows some to enter the faster @entity47 lanes			1
" defunding the program is not the answer , " @entity23 said			2

" the union representing @entity1 officers defended the program			1
" an imperfect deterrent to terrorist attacks is better than no deterrent at all , " said @entity63 president @entity62 , speaking in a conference call after the hearing			0
" is it a perfect program ? no , but until we have a better program , we should n't just trash and burn this program			0
