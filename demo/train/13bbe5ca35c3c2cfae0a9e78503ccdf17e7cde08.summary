-- @entity2 president @entity1 says he is disappointed that the buildup to saturday 's @entity5 final between @entity6 and @entity7 has been dominated by the coaches , and not the players			1
the showdown in @entity13 's @entity12 stadium has been widely billed as a battle between @entity6 manager @entity15 and @entity7 boss @entity16			1
the fact that @entity15 worked under @entity16 at @entity18 has added intrigue to a match featuring two teams who won the league and cup double in their domestic leagues			1
both managers have made bold statements in the run - up to the match , with the @entity30 @entity15 describing the contest as bigger than the @entity33 final , while @entity34 claimed that @entity7 play more " beautiful football " than @entity6			1
can @entity15 beat @entity16 to become king of @entity37 ? @entity1 , who said the final was " too unpredictable " to call , lamented the focus on the managers but suggested it may be a deliberate ploy to take the pressure off their players			1
" it 's not good because the football belongs to the players , not to the coach , for me , " he said in an exclusive interview with @entity0			0
" but they are two big personalities ; they 've had some problems in their countries at the beginning			0
they won both the league and the cup , and now they come to the final and perhaps it 's a philosophy to protect the players being in front of everybody , it 's a tactic			0
" @entity15 and @entity16 are vying to become only the third manager after @entity64 and @entity65 to win the @entity5 with two different clubs			1
@entity15 won the @entity37 title with @entity68 in 2004 while @entity16 triumphed with @entity69 in 1995			2
profile : @entity6 's maestro , @entity15 " tomorrow myself or @entity16 will for sure become the third man in that group , " said @entity15			1
" hopefully , and i speak for myself and also for @entity74 because i saw him today and he seems to be in very good shape , if we continue in our jobs the one who does n't do it tomorrow ( saturday ) will do it in the future			0
" i feel we will both join that group , one tomorrow and one later			0
" @entity15 , 47 , worked as an assistant to @entity16 for three years when the @entity34 was in charge of @entity18			2
" i think i educated @entity15 a little but he trains to win , i train to play beautiful football and win , " said the 58 - year - old @entity16			1
" my way is more difficult			0
" i think @entity15 is more defensive tactically but he has good players who can decide the outcome of a match			2
" i think @entity6 are a very difficult opponent and i think their matches against @entity93 and @entity18 have proved that			0
" profile : @entity7 boss @entity16 both teams will be missing key players through suspension , with @entity7 lining up without @entity99 winger @entity98 and @entity6 lacking @entity101 midfielder @entity100			1
but in keeping with the build - up to the match , @entity15 spent very little of his press conference on friday talking about his team , and far more time fending off questions about his own future			2
reports have linked the @entity30 with a move to @entity111 's nine - time @entity5 winners @entity13 next @entity112 said he was fully focused on the final and that " none of us can think about anything else			0
" after four or five days i 'll decide , but when the game ends tomorrow i wo n't be able to say			0
when i won with @entity68 i knew before that i would leave for @entity93 , but right now i ca n't say , " he added .			0
