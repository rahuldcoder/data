sen. @entity0 is proposing legislation aimed at eliminating criminal sentencing rules that adversely impact minorities , saying that " we need some fresh ideas to combat old and festering problems			1
" the @entity7 from @entity8 described the measure friday in a speech to the @entity11			1
it 's part of his aggressive outreach effort to african - americans and other voting groups who do n't traditionally back @entity7			1
@entity0 is trying to expand the @entity7 base and lay the groundwork for a potential 2016 campaign for the @entity21			1
his address highlighted sentencing reform , expanded voting rights , and education reform			2
it came one day after two other possible @entity7 presidential hopefuls , @entity29 gov. @entity28 and rep. @entity30 of @entity31 , also touted similar reforms			1
sentencing reform is one of @entity0 's signature issues			1
as he 's done in previous speeches , he told the audience gathered in @entity38 that the nation 's criminal justice system is still stacked against minorities			1
" three out of four people in prison right now for non-violent crimes are black or brown			0
our prisons are bursting with young men of color and our communities are full of broken families , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 fights for felon voting rights " there is a cycle of poverty that often leads to drugs , to debt , and to prison			1
in prison , child support can accumulate into the thousands of dollars			0
release from prison then finds that employers do n't want to hire a convicted felon			0
" with few options of real work , the cycle begins again			0
i say enough 's enough			0
i wo n't sit idly by and watch our criminal justice system continue to consume , confine and define our young men			2
i say we take a stand and fight for justice now , " @entity0 said			1
he then pointed out that the current legal distinctions between crack and powder cocaine have led to longer jail terms for the possession of crack			0
while he said that progress has been made in reducing those distinctions , @entity0 added that he was introducing legislation on friday that " eliminates any disparity between crack and powder cocaine			1
" @entity0 also touted that he 's working with @entity86 , like sen. @entity87 of @entity29 , on a bill that would expunge records , under certain circumstances , of non-violent and youth related crimes			1
and , he 's rubbing shoulders with attorney general @entity95 on sentencing reform as well as some @entity7 governors			2
@entity0 and his @entity86 buds @entity0 's other pitches @entity0 also used his address in front of the @entity11 convention to make another pitch for expanding the voting rights of ex- cons. " @entity107 , five million people are prevented from voting because of their criminal record			1
it 's the biggest impediment to voting in our country			0
i want more people to vote , not less , " @entity0 said			1
he described himself as " a @entity7 who wants to restore a federal role for the government in the @entity116			0
" @entity0 twice quoted from @entity117 in his speech to the century - old civil rights organization			1
and @entity0 again mentioned @entity117 as he continued his crusade against the federal government 's current surveillance activities			1
" dr. @entity117 's ' @entity124 ' speech inspired the world but it also prompted the @entity126 to tap his phone illegally and spy on tens of thousands of @entity129			2
today , all @entity129 should be concerned that the government is collecting the records of @entity129 , " he said			0
" frankly i think what @entity129 do on their cell phone is none of the government 's damn business			0
" on education reform @entity0 attacked the status quo and proposed shifting the power away from government			1
" @entity141 has no clue how to fix education			0
@entity141 does n't know if whether you 're a good teacher or a bad teacher			0
we should allow innovation to occur at the local level			0
i propose that we allow school charters , school choice , vouchers , competition			0
competition breeds excellence , " @entity0 said			2
and @entity0 also touted a plan to increase investment and job creation by moving control of some tax monies away from @entity141 and into state and local hands			2
" i have a 10 - year plan for areas of high unemployment and poverty , to lower taxes and promote employment , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 : will his star continue to rise ? @entity28 and @entity30 also make pitches some of @entity0 's language sounds similar to what @entity28 is saying			1
thursday night , he and the chairman of the @entity7 governor 's @entity173 once again said that there 's far too many people sitting in prisons for non-violent drug crimes and called on republicans to focus on people not just before they 're born but after as well			0
" i 'm pro-life and if you 're pro-life , you have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb also , " @entity28 said in an appearance at the @entity181 in @entity182 , repeating comments he made last month at a major social conservative gathering			2
gov. @entity28 : ' you have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb ' @entity28 said the justice system must stop stigmatizing the disease of drug addiction and focus more on rehabilitation			1
" we do n't give them any kind of significant treatment , long - range treatment , and then we release them			2
and then we wonder why they go back and commit more crimes to support their habit , " @entity28 said			2
the potential 2016 presidential candidate also said giving drug addicts treatment instead of prison time would help the economy too			0
earlier thursday , @entity30 , spelled out his plan to fight poverty , a pilot program that would combine 11 federal programs into one pool of money for participating states			0
@entity30 lays out new poverty plan according to the plan , which the @entity31 @entity7 detailed in a speech to the @entity217 , states would voluntarily submit their own anti-poverty proposals in order to get money			2
" if everything passed muster , the federal government would give the green light , " the @entity222 chairman said in a speech to the @entity141 - based think tank			2
" and the state would get more flexibility			0
it would get to combine into one funding stream 11 different programs , things like food stamps , housing assistance , child care , and cash welfare			0
" the @entity7 , under the direction of @entity241 chairman @entity240 , last year released a report that acknowledged the party 's problem in reaching out to younger and minority voters , who overwhelming went for president @entity246 and the @entity86 in the 2012 election			0
the report included hundreds of recommendations for the party .			0
