-- @entity1 scored a 90th minute penalty to grab a precious 3 - 2 win for @entity4 against @entity5 on wednesday as @entity7 ' side moved to within four points of the @entity10 leaders @entity11			1
following @entity13 's side disappointing 1 - 1 draw at lowly @entity15 on tuesday , @entity4 came from behind twice to complete a dramatic and potentially vital win at @entity17			1
@entity18 , who gifted @entity15 an equalizer at the @entity20 earlier this month , scored an own goal in the eighth minute to hand the home side a boost following their 2 - 2 draw against @entity25 at @entity26 on sunday			2
@entity27 equalized for the @entity28 four minutes before the break only for @entity30 to put @entity32 's side ahead again in the 63rd minute after some slack defending			0
the @entity34 's responded with a goal nine minutes later as @entity37 's 20 - yeard shot found its way past goalkeeper @entity39			2
the @entity41 keeper was replaced by @entity42 a few minutes later following a collision with @entity44			0
and it was the @entity46 keeper who had to face @entity1 's spot kick after @entity27 was brought down by @entity50 defender @entity49			1
the veteran midfielder fired home to complete only @entity4 's fifth away win of the season which , following a 5 - 1 demolition of @entity56 at the weekend , takes @entity7 ' side up to 53 points and four points off top spot			1
@entity5 remain bottom with 20 points			0
" @entity1 is peerless in situations like that , " @entity7 said			2
" he showed brilliant composure			0
it was a great result			0
we 've had to show character to come from behind twice			0
" we 're going to keep pushing			0
we 're chasing , other teams are still ahead of us			0
we need some of them to drop points			0
" @entity56 attempts to return to the top were thwarted by @entity25 in a 0 - 0 stalemate at the @entity74			1
the result , which helps neither side massively , sees the @entity78 's stay one point behind @entity11 while @entity25 remain in seventh with 42 points			2
while @entity56 dominated possession , it was @entity25 who probably had the best chances to win the game			1
but goalkeeper @entity86 denied the away side with some fine saves , notably from former @entity90 striker @entity89 at the beginning and towards the end of the game			0
" we tried tonight to win it but we got a point , " @entity93 said			0
" i 'd have liked all three but if you 'd have said to me at the start of the season that we 'd get four points off @entity56 then i 'd say that 's not that bad			1
" there was some cheer off the pitch for @entity25 today as they reported an 11.6 % rise in revenues to Â £ 122.9 million ( $ 204 million ) in the last three months of 2013 despite some below par performances this season			2
elsewhere , @entity110 consolidated fifth place with a 4 - 0 thumping of @entity113 at @entity114			0
@entity117 's side 's third consecutive league defeat sees them slip further out of contention for a @entity120 place next season , but with 37 points the @entity122 are still nine points clear of 10th place @entity125 who drew 1 - 1 with @entity128			1
the @entity130 's recent appalling weather put paid to two @entity10 fixtures wednesday , with third - place @entity133 's game against @entity135 and @entity137 's trip to @entity138 both being postponed			1
@entity139 through to @entity141 final meanwhile in @entity142 , @entity139 completed a 3 - 1 aggregate win over @entity144 to reach the final of the @entity141			1
the @entity146 took a 2 - 0 advantage into the semifinal second leg and when @entity152 made it 1 - 0 on the night ( 3 - 0 on aggregate ) in the 27th minute the contest was all but killed off			1
@entity153 scored an equalizer for the home side in the 87th minute to make it 1 - 1 on the night			2
@entity139 will face @entity157 in the april 's final after @entity157 completed a 5 - 0 aggregate win over city rivals @entity160 on tuesday .			1

@entity1 's late penalty earns @entity4 three points at @entity17
@entity25 's trip to @entity56 ends in *goalless* draw
bad weather causes postponement of two games *including* @entity133 *vs.* @entity135
@entity139 reach @entity141 final after a 3 - 1 aggregate win over @entity144
