if you fall asleep in bed every night with the tv on , you 're apparently a dying breed			0
more people now use their tablet or smartphone in the bedroom for late - night video viewing rather than switching on the tube , according to a new survey			1
@entity10 surveyed 9,500 people in 17 countries and found that " consumers are watching an enormous amount of video , in some surprising ways , in unexpected places			1
" among respondents , 46 % said they 've watched video on their smartphones in the master bedroom , and 41 % said they 've done so on tablets			1
that 's compared with 36 % who said they watch tv while , or after , hitting the sack			1
@entity10 's fourth annual @entity28 does n't delve deeply into what sort of content people are watching in the bedroom or elsewhere ( though it could be noted that the section revealing the bedroom habits is called " @entity35 " )			1
but @entity36 , a senior vice president and general manager of @entity10 's " @entity39 " service , said consumers want more flexibility in how and where they watch movies and tv shows			1
" they want to be firmly in control of the way they experience their videos , but they 're frustrated , " he said			0
" increasingly , they 're using tablets and smartphones to view their content , and they expect this experience to transition seamlessly across their favorite programs , whenever and wherever they like			2
" for example , one in 10 respondents said they watch mobile video in the kitchen			2
cooking shows , maybe ? the study had some other interesting findings , not all of which were necessarily heartening , depending on your point of view			0
the number of hours people said they watch tv every week almost doubled in two years : from 10 hours in 2011 to 19 hours this year			2
add the five to six hours respondents said they watch movies each week , and we 're looking at more than a full day every week spent with eyeballs glued to one screen or another			2
the @entity79 led the pack , reporting 23 hours of tv and six hours of movies per week			0
and the @entity84 revolution -- a growing frustration for ratings - hungry tv networks whose ads often get skipped -- was obvious			0
respondents said that almost one - third of the tv they watch ( 29 % ) is recorded			1
among those who record shows , 77 % said they do so because there 's another show they 'd rather watch at the same time , 72 % said they do it so they 'll have a digital box set of their favorite shows , and 68 % said they do it so they can skip commercials -- a number that jumps to 74 % in the @entity79 and 75 % in the @entity107 that 's been the source of a bunch of controversy			0
last year , tv networks launched a flurry of lawsuits against @entity115 over its @entity117 feature , which lets users automatically skip commercials while watching recorded shows			0
the networks , led by @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , claim that such features will ruin the system that finances their shows , while @entity115 argued that people have been skipping ads , in one way or another , since the invention of tv .			0
