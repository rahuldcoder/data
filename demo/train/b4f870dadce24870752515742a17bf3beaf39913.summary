@entity0 , @entity1 -- detective @entity3 is locking up another accused pain pill addict			1
but he 's seen this suspect before			1
she 's back in handcuffs for the second time in less than a week			1
the charge this time , like it was just four days ago , is fraudulently obtaining prescription medication			1
for @entity10 and the other detectives of the @entity12 , it will be one of 500 to 600 arrests they make each year			1
even with arrests nearly every day , " we 're just scratching the surface , " according to @entity3			1
the number of investigations the unit initiates is up 148 percent compared with a year ago			0
it can be surprisingly easy to get prescription narcotics that are highly addictive , and they 're highly profitable on the street			1
but detectives in @entity0 say most of the people they arrest are n't in it for the money			1
instead , they get pills to support their own habit , and police say they have a variety of methods for feeding their addiction			1
a former nurse will use her medical training to impersonate a doctor to call in fake prescriptions to a pharmacy and simply go in and pick up her drug of choice			1
others use prescription pads stolen from physicians or " doctor shop " by getting legitimate prescriptions from multiple doctors who are unaware of what other drugs their patients are already taking			1
@entity3 sees his job as giving those he arrests a wake - up call			1
" if i can make this the worst day of her life so that tomorrow she will seek treatment , then i 've won , " he said			0
@entity1 is among the top states in the country for prescription pill abuse , according to the @entity62 on @entity63 and @entity64			2
" people think that , well , it 's authorized by my doctor , we can pick it up at any of the local retailers on the corner , and that prescription abuse is not really a problem , " @entity3 said			1
the vast majority of those @entity3 and his fellow detectives arrest start their addiction with legitimate needs for pain medication from something such as a car accident			0
but then they ca n't stop			0
that 's what worries physicians such as dr. @entity85			1
" we know that narcotics are potentially addictive -- we do n't know who might become addicted and who might not , " he said			2
@entity85 practices in eastern @entity1 , where he says prescription pill abuse is rampant			2
" it 's come to the point where there are few people who do n't have someone in their family or know someone who 's had problems with addiction , overdose or abuse , " @entity85 said			1
when patients come looking for a prescription for powerful pain medication , doctors like him are forced to determine whether the need is real or whether the patient might be an addict			1
" there 's no test for pain , " @entity85 said			2
" the only thing we have to go on is what they tell us , and i generally believe my patients			2
but most people who are going to lie to you are much better liars than you are at detecting			2
" one of those patients who @entity85 says fooled him was a 79 - year - old grandmother who was selling her pills out of her nursing home			1
if the patient is an addict , doctors refuse them at their own peril			0
in december , a man came into dr. @entity129 's rural clinic in @entity130 , @entity1 , looking for a prescription			1
@entity129 demanded that he take a urinalysis test to check for drugs in his system			0
later that morning , the patient returned and shot and killed @entity129			0
" my dad was writing in a chart at the nurse 's station			1
someone heard my dad say , ' you do n't want to do this			0
i take care of a lot of elderly people			2
' and he said , ' well you did n't help me ' and that 's when he shot him , " @entity129 's daughter @entity146 said			2
@entity146 is now working to raise awareness of the dilemma doctors face in prescribing pain medication			0
her father , she said , was rigorous about prescribing pain medication			0
" he would drug test the pope if he came in asking for something			2
" @entity85 has encountered intimidating patients in his clinic as well			2
" physical violence is a real fear			0
we have people who come in who are threatening and abusive , " he said			0
after having one patient impersonate him , @entity85 no longer calls in controlled substances prescriptions into local pharmacies			0
some doctors , fearing either physical violence or contributing to addiction , have stopped prescribing pain medication altogether			0
that puts doctors such as @entity85 , who do prescribe , in a difficult position			0
" no matter what you do , you 're going to have an unintended consequence , " @entity85 said			0
" if you refuse to prescribe , you 'll end up with people suffering			0
and if you do prescribe , you 'll find patients diverting them , selling them , using them for recreation			0
" the solutions , police and doctors say , range from electronic prescriptions that would be difficult to forge to a national prescription database that would allow doctors to see what other drugs a pill - seeking patient is already taking			1
@entity193 is pushing for some kind of reform in the wake of her father 's death			0
" he lost his life for something as silly as a pill			0

@entity12 's drug *squad* arrests 500 - 600 people annually
detective : most people get prescription narcotics to support their own habits
many patients " doctor shop " and try to intimidate physicians into writing out prescriptions
