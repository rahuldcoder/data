-- she 's an acerbic columnist who 's made a living lighting up politicians and public figures in the opinion pages of the @entity6 , but the only lighting up that @entity7 did for her latest piece was the type typically done by her brethren over at @entity11			1
( ok , fine , her story was about the kind of marijuana that you eat , not smoke , but you get the point			0
do n't be such a buzz kill			0
) in her column published tuesday , @entity7 examined @entity20 's growing pains with its exploding marijuana industry			1
her objective was to point out that for all of the revenue , tourism and cases of munchies that have made it an economic windfall for the state , legalizing pot has n't been without problems -- she quoted health officials who say hospitals are treating " growing numbers of children and adults sickened by potent doses of edible marijuana , " and she brought up cases in which overly potent pot candy may have led one man to kill his wife , and another to leap to his death from a hotel balcony			1
gauging by the chatter on social media , her point was lost amid the cautionary tale she told			1
while she was in @entity50 , she decided to experiment with edible marijuana for the first time			0
from the sound of it , it will probably be her last			0
" i figured if i was reporting on the social revolution rocking @entity20 in january ... i should try a taste of legal , edible pot from a local shop " she wrote			1
" what could go wrong with a bite or two ? everything , as it turned out			0
" @entity7 said that after eating pot - infused chocolate - flavored candy , she " lay curled up in a hallucinatory state " in her @entity50 hotel room bed for eight hours , paranoid that a room - service waiter would narc on her			1
" i became convinced that i had died and no one was telling me " she wrote , invoking memories of the @entity71 , @entity72 , cop who called 911 to report that he and his wife may have died after consuming pot brownies			0
that call , which occurred in 2007 , went viral at a time before everyone had a @entity78 account			0
that 's not the case anymore ; @entity7 's long , strange trip has been retweeted thousands of times			1
" @entity7 has a @entity84 but this is what she 'll be remembered for on @entity78 , " @ conradhackett tweeted			2
" ' i really want to get high with @entity7 ' - said no one ever , " cracked @ kelly_carlin			2
with the skewering she 's taking , @entity7 may be wishing for short - term memory loss so she can forget all about it			2
