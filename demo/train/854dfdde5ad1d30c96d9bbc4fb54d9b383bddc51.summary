a heckler standing just behind @entity1 in @entity2 this week yelled to the president that he " has the power to stop deportation			1
" a clearly irritated @entity1 interrupted his speech and shot back that he does n't have that authority , saying the @entity8 is " a nation of laws			1
" so , who 's right ? federal immigration law provides for the deportation , or removal , of an individual under several circumstances -- including being in the country illegally , overstaying a legal visa , violation of criminal statutes or a number of other offenses â € ” after a judicial process			2
but the administration has latitude in how to enforce those laws , though legal experts say exercising that discretion too broadly is fraught with political and legal land mines			1
related : as @entity1 makes turn to immigration , protests that he 's not doing enough @entity30 , the 24 - year old heckler , is a @entity32 , @entity31 graduate and a member of @entity34 , @entity35			1
after the event on monday at a community center , the group insisted the president can use his executive authority to halt deportations			1
@entity30 and his group want @entity1 to stop all deportations , which they say creates a culture of fear among undocumented immigrants and breaks up families			1
@entity1 spokesman @entity49 pushed back , saying the president does not have that authority			1
" as i think the president said rather definitively , there is also not an executive action that would address all of the concerns that that young man had raised , " said @entity52 from @entity53			2
but that does n't convince may @entity60 , an organizer for @entity35			0
she told @entity62 tuesday that she still thinks @entity1 " blatantly lied " when he said he did n't have the power to stop deportations			1
in a statement monday , the group asked him for his " legal analysis " of why he ca n't stop deportations			1
@entity1 , however , stood firm			2
" the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like i can do something by violating our laws , " @entity1 told @entity30 monday			2
" and what i 'm proposing is the harder path , which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve			0
but it wo n't be as easy as just shouting			0
it requires us lobbying and getting it done , " he said			0
@entity1 told @entity83 in january that he 's " required to follow the law , " which makes it a misdemeanor to be in the country illegally			1
those found guilty can be deported			0
but the president has exercised discretion on deportations in the past			1
in 2012 , he announced that the @entity93 's @entity92 was not going to deport @entity94 , children of undocumented immigrants			0
and in august , he announced that parents would not deport parents caring for children			0
but still , he has been aggressive on that front			0
@entity1 has deported more people than any other president			1
for instance , 410,000 people were deported in 2012 compared to 116,000 in 2001			2
@entity1 has shifted the type of immigrants targeted for deportation			2
while the administration of president @entity109 targeted working immigrants by raiding workplaces , @entity1 is focusing on convicted criminals and " egregious " immigration violators , including recent border crossers and illegal re-entrants			1
@entity92 said 55 % of people deported last year were convicted criminals			2
@entity117 , immigration law professor at the @entity32 's @entity118 , said the president is " partially correct			2
" it 's called prosecutorial discretion			0
the executive branch has the " inherent power to choose which cases to act on , " @entity117 said			0
they can theoretically give someone driving four miles over the speed limit a ticket , but the police officer also has the ability to use discretion to give a warning instead			0
that 's the validation @entity1 used in his decision to halt deportations of youth and parents			1
but @entity139 , professor of public interest law at @entity141 , said the president 's position is that putting an end to all deportations would " abuse " his discretion			1
immigration law attorney @entity147 said he thinks @entity1 " has an obligation to enforce the law " even if he chooses how and to what extent to enforce it			1
he said the president can use his discretion to hold deportations			1
the president is " making a tactical political move to force @entity156 to act			2
he could just as easily told @entity156 that he would withhold deportations on broad categories of cases pending their action , " @entity117 wrote in an e-mail			0
the @entity162 passed comprehensive immigration reform earlier this year , which includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the @entity8			0
the legislation has been stalled in the @entity168 and is unlikely to be taken up before the end of the year			0
the issue of deportations has n't just upset immigration advocates			0
the top @entity173 on the @entity174 , rep. @entity175 , @entity176 , announced he would hold a hearing on the issue to investigate the president 's decision to not deport some people			0
the hearing is titled , " the president 's @entity182 to faithfully execute the @entity184			0
" related : 4 ways immigration reform still could happen - or not			0

@entity1 heckler wanted @entity1 to provide his " legal analysis " for continuing deportations
the president said at @entity2 event he has to " follow the law "
experts say exercising executive discretion too broadly is fraught with political and legal land mines
@entity1 has deported more people than any other chief executive
