-- sunday was marked by a slew of anti-regime protests and yet more violence targeting dissenters in @entity5 , while outside the embattled country the leaders of the @entity7 and @entity8 discussed ways to aid the opposition			1
the bloodshed includes what the @entity13 of @entity5 , a network of opposition groups , is calling the " @entity17			1

the same group also stated that such violence did not prevent demonstrations in upwards of 18 locales around @entity5 -- many of which it described as " massive , " and documented with @entity46 videos			2
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of protests , casualties or attacks in @entity5 , because the government severely restricts access by international journalists			2
meanwhile , @entity7 president @entity54 and @entity8 prime minister @entity55 met sunday to discuss how to aid the @entity5 opposition and exert pressure on @entity5 president @entity59 's regime to end its brutal crackdown on civilians			1
the meeting , which took place in @entity65 , @entity66 , where the leaders will attend a nuclear summit this week , was aimed at " syncing up " with @entity8 -- a former @entity5 ally -- before @entity70 hosts the next " @entity72 " meeting on april 1 , a senior @entity54 administration official said			1
@entity54 and @entity55 expect the upcoming conference to enhance ways to provide " non-lethal " aid to the opponents of the @entity5 regime , such as medical supplies and communications equipment , said @entity81 , a @entity7 deputy national security adviser			1

@entity55 said 17,000 refugees have fled from @entity5 to @entity8			1
@entity54 said he and @entity55 " are very much in agreement that there should be a process " to transition to a " legitimate government , " in contrast to @entity59 's current government			1
he also pledged to keep pursuing humanitarian aid as reports of carnage at the hands of the the @entity5 regime mount daily			2
a key political opposition body in @entity5 said sunday that in a @entity99 era , the @entity5 state would be based on " equality , " regardless of ethnicity , religious beliefs or political affiliation			1
in a new charter , the @entity104 vowed " to protect all rights , to dispel fears , inspire trust and confidence			0
" some analysts have expressed concern about what the @entity112 - dominated @entity104 might do if @entity59 's @entity115 - dominated regime falls			0
in its announcement sunday , the group said it is committed to " democracy , pluralism , equality and human rights , " as well as rejecting and fighting terrorism			2
the group also said every citizen should have equal rights to run for office			0
sunday 's announcement comes after a top defector from the @entity5 military said armed rebel groups have aligned under the leadership of the @entity131			2
uniting all efforts will bolster the anti-regime movement and safeguard the nation , @entity135			0
gen. @entity136 said in a video posted on @entity46			0
the move addressed a key concern for observers of the @entity5 crisis both inside and outside the country -- that armed rebel groups were disjointed and divided			2
" in these critical and difficult times that our beloved country is going through , all the honorable men and women in this nation are required to work on uniting all efforts to overthrow this corrupt regime , " @entity136 said			0
" the soldiers and officers of the @entity131 pledged their allegiance to protect the people and the nation			0
" the @entity5 government routinely blames the vaguely defined " armed terrorist groups " for violence in the country , while most reports from inside @entity5 indicate the government is slaughtering civilians in an attempt to wipe out dissidents			2
these differing accounts were evident again sunday of the southern city of @entity166			0
the opposition @entity167 said five defected soldiers and three members of @entity59 's security forces were killed in the fighting			0
the state - run @entity172 said " six of the most dangerous wanted terrorists " were killed in clashes as authorities " stormed a den of terrorists			0
" two " competent authorities " were also killed , the government news agency said			0
the @entity183 estimates the @entity5 conflict has killed more than 8,000 people ; opposition activists put the toll at more than 10,000			1
on sunday , @entity188 -- a former @entity183 secretary - general who is now serving as a special envoy with that world body and the @entity191 -- was in @entity192 to seek help from longtime @entity59 ally @entity194 in helping bring about a cease - fire in @entity5			1
@entity194 's president praised @entity188 's efforts and pledged to offer assistance , the state - run @entity197 news agency reported			1
" perhaps , it 's @entity5 's last chance to avoid a bloody civil war			0
we are very hopeful that your work will have a positive result , " president @entity205 told @entity188 , according to the news agency			0
@entity5 's official news agency , @entity172 , stated that @entity194 foreign minister @entity211 also met with @entity188			1
@entity211 noted support for @entity188 's mission , but said that mission " requires not interfering in @entity5 's internal affairs and not allowing supporting only one of the conflict parties , " according to @entity172			1
@entity194 and @entity218 have blocked @entity220 attempts to pass resolutions condemning the @entity59 regime			0
the two countries say they want the violence to stop , but would not blame the bloodshed squarely on the regime			0
