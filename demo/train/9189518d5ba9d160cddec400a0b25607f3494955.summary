@entity0 -- from the ice age to the modern age , a 42,000 - year - old baby woolly mammoth debuted on the world stage in @entity0			1
scientists say @entity7 , which means " love " in @entity9 , died after 32 days of life , drowning in river mud in present - day @entity13			1
and for more than 40 millennia , she laid there encased in her dark , frigid grave			0
but thursday the two - foot tall baby mammoth stood in the hot spotlight at @entity0 's high - end @entity20 -- across from @entity21 and flanked by an @entity23 store and a @entity25 ice cream shop			1
@entity26 , general manager of @entity27 , explained how ice age relics pair up with modern - day retail			1
" we try to be a little bit more than a shopping mall			0
we want to try and be a cultural center			0
we 're always looking for events that will attract a more cultural kind of angle			0
" @entity26 declined to say exactly how much money the mall paid to get @entity7 from her home at @entity9 's @entity40 but he did hint it was in the realm of several million @entity0 dollars -- 7.8 million @entity0 dollars equals about $ 1 million in @entity44 currency			1
" we do n't do it for the monetary gain , " @entity26 said			0
" we 're doing it more for the cultural connection for the @entity0 people and to get something interesting for the shopping mall			0
" he says the " headaches " and " red tape " -- including a @entity0 promise to @entity9 to return @entity7 -- were worth it for the archaeological significance			1
@entity58 , the @entity60 explorer who announced @entity7 's discovery in 2007 , divulged that @entity7 is insured for @entity44 $ 1.5 million			1
but the director of the @entity64 added she is priceless			0
" when you have access to such a specimen you think it 's not possible			2
you have to pinch yourself and think you are dreaming , " he said			0
@entity58 goes on to say how excited he was to see @entity7 for the first time , and how fortunate a reindeer herder found the mammoth in 2007			1
the region 's extreme cold and the lack of oxygen from @entity7 's thick mud grave had helped to keep her nearly 100 % intact			1
aside from missing a few toenails , @entity7 still sports a tuft of hair			2
her skin is a near life - like grey			0
even her last meal was preserved			0
that included her mother 's milk and bits of her mother 's feces -- an aid for digestion			0
the baby mammoth is not alone on her field trip to @entity95			1
also on loan from @entity9 's @entity40 is a three - story , two - ton replica of a woolly mammoth skeleton			2
a trio of real skulls from other extinct ice age animals round out @entity7 's coterie -- a woolly rhino with a long single horn , a steppe bison and an open - mouthed cave lion baring its sharp predator 's teeth			1
but @entity7 is the star of this show			2
to the thousands of expected visitors , she may prove that being 42,000 years old never looked so good			0
the exhibit " i love @entity7 : @entity113 of the @entity114 " extends to may 10 , 2012 at @entity0 's @entity112 .			2
