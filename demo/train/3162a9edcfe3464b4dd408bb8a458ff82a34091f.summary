-- a confidential draft @entity4 report accuses @entity6 of exporting arms to the @entity9 government in violation of a ban on weapons sales , a @entity2 diplomat said wednesday on condition of anonymity			1
the draft report describes three seizures of @entity6 weapons shipments , including two bound for @entity9 , within the past year , said the diplomat , who was not authorized to release details to the media			1
the report was drafted by a panel of experts and submitted to the @entity25 's committee that monitors sanctions against @entity6 , the official told @entity0			2
there was no immediate reaction to the report on @entity6 government - run @entity30			1
the accusation came as @entity35 , in a rare interview , told @entity36 24 that weapons bound for rebels were entering his country from neighboring @entity40 and @entity41			1
" you ca n't simply close the borders and stop the smuggling , but you can reduce the flow , " he said			0
in recent days , violence has spilled over into @entity40 and @entity41 , where thousands of @entity9 have fled			1
at least one person was killed and an undetermined number were wounded thursday in renewed clashes in the northern @entity40 city of @entity52 between factions supporting and opposing the uprising in @entity9 , @entity40 's @entity47 reported			1
@entity55 put the blame instead on the so - called @entity57 , during which popular revolutions have toppled the governments of @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			0
" if we take into consideration the developments in @entity9 , the events in @entity61 and other countries , for the leaders of these countries , it 's becoming clear that this is not ' spring ' but chaos , " @entity35 said			1
the @entity57 movements inspired the uprising in @entity9 , which began in march 2011 with protests calling for political reforms			1
it devolved into a revolt with an armed opposition amid a crackdown by @entity35 's forces			2
the @entity4 estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14 months of conflict , while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000			1
@entity0 can not independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the @entity9 government has severely restricted access by international media			1
at least 20 people were killed thursday in attacks across the country , according to the @entity94 , an opposition network that collects casualty reports and organizes anti-government protests			1
the deaths include 10 in the @entity98 suburbs of @entity99 and @entity100 , three in @entity101 , three in @entity102 , two in @entity103 , one in @entity104 , and one in @entity106 , the @entity94 said			0
@entity9 blames violence in the country on " armed terrorist groups			2
" some groups " continued perpetrating massacres and targeting law enforcement members and citizens , and vandalizing public and private properties " on thursday , state - run news agency @entity109 reported			0
thirteen " army , law enforcement and civilian martyrs " were buried thursday , @entity109 said			1
it added that 72 people from @entity123 , @entity101 and @entity98 " who were involved in the latest events but did n't commit crimes , gave themselves up with their weapons to the authorities wednesday			2
" opposition groups , including members of the rebel army , say @entity35 's government has been trying to hamper their efforts by accusing them falsely of links to terrorism			2
a video posted on @entity136 purported to show thousands of anti-government protesters outside @entity138 , where blue - helmeted men could be seen			0
the @entity4 observes wear blue helmets			0
@entity0 could not confirm the authenticity of the video			0
while rebel forces , called the @entity143 , say their ranks are filled by defectors from @entity9 security forces , @entity35 described them as criminals			2
" it 's not an army , first of all , and it 's not free because they get their arms from different foreign countries , " he said in the interview			0
" that 's why they are not free at all -- they are a bunch of criminals who have been violating the law for years and have been sentenced in various criminal cases			0
there are religious extremist elements among them , like those from @entity165			0
" @entity55 dismissed the international pressure brought to bear for him to end the violence and step down , vowing that @entity9 would not bow on any issue			2
the @entity169 , the @entity170 and the @entity4 have targeted @entity9 with a number of economic sanctions targeting @entity35 and his government			1
@entity55 acknowledged the sanctions have hurt @entity9 's economy			2
" the world does n't consist just of @entity177 and the @entity169 , and we find alternatives which allow us to overcome these difficulties , " he said			2
" we can support small and mid-sized business , the basic element of our economy is agriculture , and it 's hard to affect it with sanctions			0
" he also called a boycott of recent parliamentary elections by the opposition a failure			0
" it seems to some people that if we conducted the reforms earlier , the situation would have been better now			0
it 's not right for one reason -- terrorists spit on reforms			0
they are not fighting for reforms , they are fighting to bring terror , " he said			0
meanwhile , the @entity169 government distanced itself from a @entity208 report that said more and better weapons are making their way into the hand of @entity9 rebels			1
the newspaper , citing unidentified officials and opposition activists , reported that the arms are being paid for by @entity218 nations and coordinated , in part , by the @entity169			1
" the @entity169 has made a decision to provide nonlethal support to civilian members of the opposition , " @entity220 , a @entity221 spokeswoman told reporters wednesday			1
" ... but with regard to any assertions with regard to lethal , we are not involved in that			0
" the @entity169 has expressed reservations about arming rebels , citing division among the opposition			1
meanwhile , those divisions deepened thursday with the @entity237 , widely perceived by @entity2 countries as a primary coalition for the opposition , coming under fire by a leading opposition activist group			1
the @entity94 called the national council a " failure , " and vowed to withdraw from the group			0
the council has been under fire for failing to unify the opposition groups and bring in international support			0
@entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			0

at least 20 people are killed thursday , an opposition group says
