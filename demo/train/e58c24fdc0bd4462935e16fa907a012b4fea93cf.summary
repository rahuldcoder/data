@entity0 -- he may be one of the most sought - after painters you have never heard of , but @entity6 's name is doing the rounds of newsrooms and international art - loss registers following an audacious theft of his works from a collection in the @entity13			1
four oil paintings by the @entity16 artist , who lived from 1882 until 1953 , were stolen on november 18 from a collection at a castle in @entity19 , northwest of @entity20			1
the works , which date from the 1920s to the 1940s , are estimated to be worth between 50 million and 80 million @entity13 crowns ( approximately $ 2.6 million and $ 4.2 million ) according to the @entity25			1
a spokesperson for the @entity27 , an international database of stolen and missing works of art and antiquities , confirmed the works were still registered as stolen on their database			0
@entity34 , executive director and general counsel of the @entity27 , said that if any of the paintings were offered to the register 's subscribing auction houses , they would be notified immediately			0
" either they are recovered relatively quickly or they will go underground and wo n't resurface for years , " he said			0
the theft comes as interest in @entity6 's work is rising both in the @entity13 and abroad			1
in november , a painting by the artist dating from 1911 and entitled " @entity48 " ( " comforter " in @entity50 ) was sold at an auction in @entity20 for 12 million @entity13 crowns ( approximately $ 640,000 ) , according to @entity53 , which staged the auction			1
a spokesperson for the gallery told @entity57 is undoubtedly " a major figure " in avant - garde @entity60 painting , having exhibited across @entity60 and even in the @entity62 between @entity63 , but has not had much exposure over the last 50 years			2
all that is changing , according to @entity13 art historian @entity66			0
" even though there are more collectors of @entity6 from the @entity13 and @entity70 , there are more and more foreign collectors ( interested in his work ) , " he said			0
the reason may be down to his famous contemporaries , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , whom @entity6 knew when he lived in @entity79 before @entity80 and who inspired him to adopt their @entity83 style			2
according to @entity66 , his work presents " the other face of @entity85 , something that is very parallel ( to @entity85 ) but also different , " and therefore increasingly sought - after by collectors of work from that style and period			0
" it 's very difficult to buy the original @entity83 works of @entity76 and @entity77 from the 1910s but you can still buy @entity6 's works from those years , " said @entity66			1
though he can not say whether the theft of @entity6 's paintings from the collection in @entity19 is related to his recent upswing in popularity , @entity66 believes it may have been an opportunistic heist , with the thieves taking advantage of the collection 's reportedly limited security			1
" the @entity107 case is a very strange one , because the paintings that were stolen are known , they were published in catalogs and journals , so i would say they are publicly unsellable , " he said , echoing @entity34 's fears they may go underground			0
works by the artist are currently on display as part of an exhibition on @entity119 at the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity13 , entitled " @entity122 : reverse side of @entity124 -- 1945			0
" " if you want a good collection of @entity13 modern art from the 1920s and 30s , you ca n't miss ( @entity6 ) , " said @entity66 .			2
