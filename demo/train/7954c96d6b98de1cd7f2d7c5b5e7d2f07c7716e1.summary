@entity2 , @entity1 -- " men do n't play netball			1
" " men just jump like goats			1
" " they ca n't handle it			1
" " they are too serious			1
" " they ca n't take abuse from the women			1
" " they complain ! " that 's how a group of @entity15 women describe the game of netball in a new ( pre-viral ? ) video from a nonprofit group called @entity20 , which seems bent on re-framing the way the western world thinks of @entity23 , particularly @entity25 women			1
the group 's campaign , called " stop the @entity28 , " was launched here at the @entity30 conference in @entity2 , @entity1			1
the goal , as the title makes clear , is to help women around the world by empowering them , celebrating their successes , instead of feeling bad about the vast inequalities that do exist			2
as anyone who 's spent time in @entity23 will tell you , it 's a diverse continent that 's home to both immense joy and incredible sorrow			1
there 's no shortage of tearjerker statistics			2
the @entity46 , for example , says nearly half of people in @entity23 live on less than $ 1.25 per day			1
thirty - seven percent of people who lack access to clean water live in that region			2
it 's also a hotbed for malaria , etc. intense inequalities do exist			2
but even numbers tell another side to the story , as @entity59 points out in a recent article titled " @entity61			2
" " consumer spending will almost double in the next ten years ; the number of countries with average incomes above $ 1,000 per person a year will grow from less than half of @entity23 's 55 states to three - quarters , " the magazine said			1
and , most important : " @entity25 deserve the credit			2
western aid agencies , @entity72 mining companies and @entity74 peacekeepers have done their bit , but the continent 's main saviors are its own people			1
" all the more reason to celebrate @entity20 's efforts to focus on joy instead of suffering			2
the group 's videos build on a rising chorus of voices calling for change in the way people from richer countries see those who live in poorer places			1
a blog called @entity93 has been posting examples of what it considers " poverty porn , " or ads , videos and news stories that generally show @entity25 as one - dimensional victims			1
others use the term " badvocacy , " which the blog @entity1 in @entity23 defines as " a good catch - all term to describe advocacy that begins with great intentions to help those who are suffering , but that at best accomplishes nothing or at worst actually makes the problem even more difficult to solve			1
" @entity113 , that blog 's author and an assistant political science professor at @entity116 , writes that advocates sometimes oversimplify issues or make them too sexy with the help of celebrities and flashy campaigns			2
the recently released video focuses on netball , a game it describes as a cross between basketball and ultimate frisbee , because that 's what the women wanted to discuss			1
" we asked the women what they wanted to talk about , " @entity130 , founder and " chief visionary " of @entity20 told me			2
" they really wanted @entity139 to know how much they love netball			2
" and it does n't hurt that it 's tracked with @entity143 's " @entity142			2
" even if the @entity20 video is highly produced , it 's still possible to appreciate the fact that it 's trying to promote empowerment and not pity or guilt			1
and the netball video is just one of several from the group			1
another features a boy reciting the plot of an @entity156 movie			0
( @entity158 views : 640,000 )			0
one shows men making fun of how @entity25 tend to show up in @entity162 movies toting guns and wearing scowls			0
( views : 1.05 million ) they 're humorous and light			0
@entity167 says that 's what 's needed in 2013			0
" we have to have partnership instead of pity , " she said of the way the @entity172 interacts with @entity23			1
" partnership does n't include pity			0
it includes seeing people as equals and being able to work with them on an equal partnership			0
" it 's an issue that 's personal for @entity167			0
it started with her " brother from another mother			0
" that 's how she explains her relationship with @entity189 , a young boy in @entity15 whose photo sat on her mother 's mantle next to @entity167 '			0
" i was always hearing about his grades and who his friends were , " she said			0
her mom , a dance teacher and writer , had adopted the boy in a way , sponsoring community development projects in his village , @entity167 said			0
after her mother died from cancer in 2006 , @entity167 decided to visit the village and to meet @entity189			0
she told him , " i 'm going to take care of you now			0
" on the surface , if that does n't sound like a " white savior " moment , i do n't know what does			0
it conjures up images of condescending white missionaries trekking to @entity23 to dispense water , food and religion -- all to show their superiority			1
but @entity167 does n't see it that way			0
" if anything , i was in the deep depths of despair , " because of her mother 's death , " and i saw how connected life is , " she said			0
" and that really saved me			0
" @entity20 works with communities to start orphanages , improve sanitation and reduce poverty			0
but they only do so , she said , after living in the community for long enough that they can listen to people there about what problems could be solved with the help of outside funds or expertise			0
the group currently has 32 projects in four countries , she said , and an annual budget of about $ 500,000			1
and the best way to promote that work may be to stop pitying the people she 's trying to help			0
they 're friends , sisters , brothers , neighbors , netballers			0
