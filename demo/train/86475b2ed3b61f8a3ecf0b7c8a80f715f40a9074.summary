-- usually , when characters in a movie are one - dimensional , that 's not a good thing			2
but in " @entity5 : @entity10 , " the waxworks figures who come to life after sundown are n't crassly sketchy or dramatically lacking			1
they 're one - dimensional , all right , but knowingly , delightfully so			0
@entity15 and @entity16 size up a bobble - head @entity12 in the " @entity5 " sequel			1
even at their most pop - up brash , they 're true to the way that kids see history			0
they 're like characters out of a cool yet innocent mischief - at - midnight children 's book -- a " @entity28 " of global story - time kitsch			0
and they give you a lift			0
the movie , make no mistake , is clownishly silly , a lark as light as balsa wood			2
if anything , though , it 's a faster , wittier spin on the formula of its predecessor			0
released in 2006 , " @entity5 " was a family popcorn extravaganza that touched a chord even its producers may not have anticipated			1
in the sequel , @entity15 , as the former night guard @entity47 ( he 's now a successful entrepreneur ... of flashlights ! ) , spends one long night infiltrating the galleries of the @entity51 , where he attempts to rescue the exhibits he first got to know at the @entity53			1
( he 's trying to get his hands on the magical @entity56 tablet that brings them to life			0
) the @entity59 , the capuchin monkeys , @entity61 -- all have been shipped to the archives of the @entity51			1
and all are as feisty as ever			0
but " @entity10 " tilts away from the zoological			0
the film is a history - of - the - world burlesque in which such drolly self - centered icons as @entity69 ( @entity70 ) , @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , and @entity10 ( @entity73 ) -- a made - up pharoah who lisps with the enthusiasm of @entity77 on his own reality show -- collide happily with a living army of @entity12 bobblehead dolls , plus stone - carved angels who sing " @entity83 " and " @entity87 " come to life as a @entity86 deadbeat			2
this is what you call a wholesome kiddie movie on drugs			2
it all works because @entity15 , with his eager - to - please anxiety and his incredulous double takes , is the perfect addled straight man for a hellzapoppin history show			1
and it works because @entity16 , as @entity99 , has the breathless , daffy - sexy vivacity of a ' 30s screwball heroine , her eyes lit with fire , her delivery as sharp as cut glass as she rat - a - tats out lines like " you have n't been able to take your cheaters off my chassis since we met ! " " @entity10 " has plenty of life			1
but it 's @entity117 who gives it zing			0
