-- the undersea gusher in the @entity4 has been brought under control , but the worst oil spill in @entity8 history will continue to be felt along the @entity9 for some time , @entity2 administration officials said sunday			1
" if you 're sitting in @entity12 , it 's still a disaster			1
if the folks have not come back to the panhandle of @entity16 , it 's still a disaster , " former coast guard adm. @entity17 , the administration 's point man for the disaster , told @entity0 's " @entity20			1
" a report from the @entity22 last week found three - quarters of the oil spilled between late april and @entity24 has been collected , dispersed or evaporated			2
but @entity17 said , " we need to keep a steady hand at the tiller to keep the cleanup going			1
" " it 's a catastrophe			2
it 's a catastrophe for the people of the @entity4 , and it requires our attention until we get the job done , " he said			2
and @entity35 environmental adviser @entity34 told @entity40 's " @entity39 " that the " first phase " of the disaster was over -- but it is " not the end by any means			1
" the well erupted after an april 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig @entity46 that left 11 men dead			0
a temporary cap contained the spill on july 15 , and nearly 3,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud and cement drove the well back into the ocean floor last week			0
the final step -- the completion of a relief well that will permanently seal the blowout from below -- is expected to be completed sometime between august 13 and 15 , @entity54 , a spokesman for the relief effort , reported sunday			1
@entity54 said the rig drilling the relief well was within the final 100 feet of intercepting the blown - out bore			2
the spill inflicted heavy blows on @entity9 industries like tourism and fishing , but @entity17 said some parts of the region are beginning to see a recovery			1
" it 's starting to happen already , but it 's happening incrementally , where the oil is not there now , where we 've cleaned it up , " he said			1
" some beaches are reopening			0
and that will happen as soon as we can , either by cleaning up the oil or having the areas tested through @entity22 and @entity84 for seafood safety and so forth			2
" the well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels ( 2.3 million gallons ) of oil per day before it was capped			0
since then , fresh , green grass has begun growing again in some of the hardest - hit marshes of southern @entity90 , but oil continues to wash ashore in places			1
" there 's a lot of clean - up working going on here , and that 's excellent , " @entity93 , of the @entity94 , told @entity0 last week			0
" but the tide keeps coming and going each and every day			0
" federal authorities say up to 1 million barrels of oil may still lie beneath the surface of the @entity4			0
@entity34 said cleanup crews from the government and well owner @entity107 fought to keep the oil out of beaches and coast marches , but what did reach shore " has to be cleaned up			1
" " some of it may continue to come on shore , the residual			0
it 'll come on in tar balls and tar mats , and that can be cleaned up , " @entity34 said			0
in addition , she said scientists are examining marine life in the @entity4 , " and right now nobody is seeing anything of concern			0
" @entity0 's @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
