-- in @entity4 , thousands of public school teachers and support staff represented by the @entity3 have walked off their jobs after reaching an impasse in contract talks with the city			1
last month , 780 machinists at a @entity11 parts plant in @entity12 , @entity13 , voted to end their three and a half month strike , accepting a six - year contract that contained almost all of the concessions the company demanded			1
these contemporary disputes hide a dramatic historical fact : the strike has almost disappeared from @entity23 life			1
during the 1970s , an average of 289 major work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers occurred annually in the @entity23			1
by the 1990s , that had fallen to about 35 per year			2
and in 2009 , there were no more than five			2
the decline in strikes can not be explained solely by declining union membership			1
according to a study by sociologist @entity34 , unionization among private - sector full - time employees fell by 40 % between 1984 and 2002			2
but the drop in total strike frequency was even greater , falling by more than two - thirds			1
what has happened to the strike , and what does it mean ? since the 1970s , the forces of economic globalization and technological changes have put increasing pressure on employers and employees			2
neither of those forces by themselves , however , requires the disappearance of either unions or strikes , as is shown by the example of other industrialized nations such as @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and many @entity61 countries			2
rather , the most important difference in the @entity23 experience has been a profound change in the legal and institutional order governing labor relations and workers ' rights			1
we have essentially gone back to a @entity71 era of workplace governance			0
before the 1930s , @entity23 unions confronted a legal environment that historians have described as " judicial repression			1
" during that time , federal courts repeatedly struck down workers ' rights to organize and act collectively , making unions themselves all but illegal			1
in 1935 , the @entity82 ( @entity82 ) created a process for legally recognizing union representation and managing private - sector labor conflict			2
the result was historic democratization of the @entity23 workplace and economy			1
the strike was a crucial part of this system : while the law was intended to reduce industrial strife , it also relied on the right to strike to protect the integrity of the bargaining process			2
the prospect of economic sanctions served to push both employers and employees to compromise and negotiate their way toward a peaceful agreement			0
thus , the right to strike was explicitly protected in the language of the @entity82 and affirmed by the @entity23 @entity108 in 1960			1
from the beginning , though , employers gained a crucial advantage			0
in 1938 , the @entity108 ruled that while workers could not be fired for striking , they could be " permanently replaced , " a distinction with little difference in reality			0
for much of the @entity119 period , employers generally accepted unions in sectors where they were already established			0
but in 1981 , president @entity122 summarily fired the striking federal air traffic controllers			0
@entity122 's actions announced a critical turn in the federal government 's attitude toward workers ' rights			2
as a result , employers quickly adopted more aggressive tactics against unions and their strikes			0
decades of conservative federal court and @entity137 decisions have now turned the law upside down			0
for example , in 1983 the @entity108 allowed permanent replacements to sue their employer if they were dismissed in favor of returning strikers , making a negotiated settlement of such strikes much more difficult			0
in 1989 , the court ruled that the federal @entity147 governing transportation unions did not require employers to lay off employees who crossed picket lines in order to reinstate more senior strikers after an economic strike			2
that case brought a blistering dissent from justice @entity157 , who found no basis for the court to favor crossover workers " unless it is perhaps an unarticulated hostility towards strikes			0
" at the bargaining table , the threat of replacement dovetails with legal rules that give management unilateral power to impose its last offer on declaration of impasse			0
as labor law scholar @entity171 notes , the @entity137 issued a series of decisions under the @entity122 administration that lowered the number of bargaining sessions needed to show impasse , reduced the obligation to provide information to the union and gave employers freer rein to seek concessions , including total discretion in wages			2
these decisions have made it easier for employers to reach impasse and then implement their desired terms and conditions			0
the previous mechanisms that once encouraged settlement are now reversed : managers have incentive to reach impasse quickly and terminate bargaining , while unions often must scramble simply to avoid deadlock			0
disputes over impasse and implementation have featured in many high - profile labor struggles of recent years , involving @entity11 , @entity203 , the @entity204 and major league sports			0
even profitable employers can make extraordinary demands , and increasingly firms have chosen to lock out their workers and operate with replacements , as the @entity211 is doing with its unionized referees			0
in effect , we have returned to a policy of judicial repression			0
the government may no longer send in troops , but ruinous legal and financial penalties threaten unions that go beyond tight restrictions on collective action			0
for some , the disappearance of strikes may seem like a good thing , an end to the disruptions and occasional inconvenience they may cause			0
but there are more serious consequences to the loss of workers ' rights to organize and to strike			1
the decline of unionization has contributed to the rise of economic inequality in the @entity23 over the past several decades			1
more than that , it also signals a historic de-democratization of the institutions that traditionally served to hold corporations accountable and govern our working life , from the scope of collective bargaining on the job to the protection for workers ' rights under the law			1
" this is a difficult decision for all of us to make , " said union president @entity253 about the @entity4 teachers ' call for a strike			1
work stoppages involve real sacrifices , not least of all from the striking workers			0
for the sake of our economic and political future , however , @entity23 would be better off if we had more strikes			1
@entity4 parents : what are you doing to keep your kids busy ? share your story with @entity272			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			1

in @entity4 , public school teachers are set to go on strike
@entity275 : the strike has mostly disappeared from @entity23 life
he says declining union membership is *n't* the only reason ; the laws have changed
@entity275 : *weakening* of rights to organize and to strike has serious consequences
