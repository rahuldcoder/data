@entity0 -- former @entity3 military chief @entity2 is poised to win his country 's presidential election in a landslide -- though the legitimacy of his victory is already being questioned			1
exit polls suggest @entity2 won 95.3 % of the vote , while opponent @entity11 garnered only 4.7 % , according to data from the @entity13 and the @entity3 tv channel @entity15			1
@entity3 's state - run @entity17 news agency reported an even more lopsided margin , based on unofficial results , with @entity11 only getting 3.5 % of the vote			1
the final results will be announced by saturday or sunday , according to the same agency			0
@entity11 , @entity2 's lone competitor , conceded defeat in a press conference thursday , acknowledging , " it is time to respect the people 's choice and admit my loss			2
" he did n't embrace the process -- including allegations his campaign representatives were attacked and detained , that @entity2 's representatives were allowed inside polling stations and claims of forgery -- according to @entity17			2
" we can not give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results , " @entity11 said			2
" the announced results are an insult to the intelligence of the @entity3			0
" turnout at 48 % despite extra day of voting the election was called amid a turbulent political year in @entity3 that saw @entity47 -- the country 's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader @entity50 -- himself removed from power in july in a military coup			1
@entity2 , who was army chief at the time , stepped down from his military post this year to run for president			2
analysts have said that -- in order to demonstrate his legitimacy -- @entity2 would want to beat the turnout rate of the 2012 presidential elections , which was 46 % in the first round and increased to 51.8 %			1
as it turned out , the country seemingly struggled to get voters to the polls this week			0
officials even tacked on a third day of voting wednesday -- a move both campaigns challenged -- in an attempt to boost turnout			0
presidential elections commission member @entity70 ended up putting the final turnout figure at 48 % , according to @entity17 -- hardly a resounding number			1
@entity2 's campaign hailed the election on its official @entity77 page , saying that all those involved helped " bedazzle " the world			0
" the nation has put itself , with its great people 's will , on the beginning of the right track and has stepped firmly and trustingly ... towards the future they 've chosen , " the campaign post said , according to @entity17			0
it is a future that -- at least for now -- will not include the @entity89 , the @entity91 group that @entity47 belonged to and that has been banned and declared a terrorist organization since his ouster			0
to this end , interim president @entity94 issued a decree thursday canceling @entity47 's pardoning of 52 islamists -- including nine @entity89 leaders and 18 jihadists -- tied to a failed 1995 assassination attempt on @entity50			1
