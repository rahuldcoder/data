the battle in @entity1 over the budget is not mere partisan squabbling			0
what we are debating is the perennial argument between right and left : do we as a society prefer to leave the well - being of our people to the indifference of the market economy , or do we believe that government also has an important role to play ? we are accustomed to thinking of the argument between left and right as an ideological or philosophical debate , so it has no " correct " answer			1
but there is an answer : we are entirely capable of knowing what policies best contribute to people leading positive and rewarding lives			1
in recent decades , social scientists have been studying human happiness in the same way we study any other human attribute			0
vast new multidisciplinary research has emerged around the proposition that it is possible to empirically measure the extent to which people view their lives as satisfying			1
can it be stopped ? 8 answers on @entity36 and the shutdown so what conditions best promote more rewarding lives ? the answer is simple and unequivocal : happier people live in countries with a generous social safety net , or , more generally , countries whose governments " tax and spend " at higher rates , reflecting the greater range of services and protections offered by the state			1
( these findings come from analysis of data from the @entity55 for the 21 @entity57 industrial democracies from 1981 to 2007 for my book " the @entity60			2
" similar findings have been reported in peer - reviewed journals like " @entity63 " and the " @entity64			0
" ) the relationship could not be stronger or clearer : however much it may pain conservatives to hear it , the " nanny state , " as they disparagingly call it , works			0
across the western world , the quality of human life increases as the size of the state increases			1
it turns out that having a " nanny " makes life better for people			2
this is borne out by the @entity82 2013 " @entity81 , " which found @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , the @entity87 and @entity88 the top five happiest nations			0
conservatives may be equally troubled to learn that labor unions have a similar effect			0
not only are workers who belong to unions happier , but the overall rate of happiness for everyone -- members and nonmembers -- increases dramatically as the percentage of workers who belong to unions grows , reflecting the louder political voice that organization gives to ordinary citizens			2
all this remains true when controlling for the many other things that might also affect quality of life , such as income , age , gender , marital status , or their country 's culture , history , or level of economic development			2
critically , " big government " and labor unions also promote happiness not merely for those toward the bottom or middle of the income distribution , but for everyone , rich and poor , men and women , conservatives and liberals			0
the same pattern emerges when looking at our states			0
people who live in states with higher welfare spending , more organized labor , more liberal state governments , more regulation of business , and a greater recent history of control by the @entity142 , are all more satisfied with their lives , regardless of income , and again when controlling for other factors that are likely to affect well - being			1
@entity146 : @entity148 strategy on shutdown courts doom the reasons the progressive agenda promotes happiness are complex , but stated simply , the more we supplement the cold efficiency of the market with interventions that reduce poverty , insecurity , and inequality , the more we improve quality of life for everyone			1
as poet and novelist @entity175 observed , " rats and roaches live by competition under the laws of supply and demand ; it is the privilege of human beings to live under the laws of justice and mercy			0
" it takes no great insight to see that a world with less insecurity and less poverty , which is to say , a world more governed by justice and mercy , is one that people of all social classes will find more satisfying			1
many benefit directly from social programs or the representation of their interests by unions ; others worry less than they otherwise might because they know these institutions exist when needed ; and everyone benefits indirectly by living in a society which is relatively free of social pathologies , such as the higher rates of violent crime , that come with the poverty , inequality and insecurity that liberal policies help ameliorate			1
the data demonstrate that this is not merely softhearted wishful thinking			0
whatever else unions and liberal public policies might do , they help make the world a better place to the extent that we believe human happiness is the appropriate metric to measure such judgments			2
that in turn suggests the most intellectually compelling strategy available to progressives in the battle for public opinion : traditional @entity222 policies are precisely those that best allow citizens to pursue the happiness that the founders of our republic so famously argued to be the final justification for the @entity230 experiment .			1

@entity232 : well - being should not be *decided* by the indifferent marketplace
@entity232 : research shows happier people live in places with generous social safety nets
in @entity57 nations , he says , the quality of life for all increases with more liberal policies
he says this applies to @entity230 states : people happier with less insecurity and less poverty
