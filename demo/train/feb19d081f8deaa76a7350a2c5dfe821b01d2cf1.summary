-- how do @entity2 punks keep their mohawks standing tall ? why does cash in @entity2 need to be kept clean ? what does making a kissing sound in a @entity8 restaurant get you ? as recently as a year ago , few people would have cared about the answers to any of these questions			1
but newfound political freedom has brought a surge in tourism to the once isolated country , making @entity2 a 2013 traveler 's hot spot , and a place worth getting up to speed on			1
fall in love with @entity2 food 1			1
new year celebrations last four days the @entity2 make a big deal of the @entity24			1
@entity25 , known as the " water throwing festival , " is celebrated in april			0
this year it takes place april 13 - 16			2
everything shuts down over the four - day @entity24 -- banks , restaurants , shops			1
the biggest celebrations are in @entity8 and @entity34			0
during the @entity24 water - throwing frenzy everyone throws and sprays water at each other			2
staying dry is n't an option			0
water symbolizes the washing away of the previous year 's bad luck and sins			2
on @entity45 , the fourth day of the festival , fish and birds are released as acts of merit and feasts are held for monks			0
in recent years of privation , hard - core @entity2 punks used leather glue to spike up their hair at @entity24			1
the superstrong glue meant their mohawks stayed standing through the @entity57 , but when the party was over they had to shave their hair			0
these days , @entity2 punks use hairspray			1
@entity2 : is now a good time to go ? 2			1
@entity2 has fantastic beaches @entity2 has 1,250 miles ( 2,000 kilometers ) of coastline and some of the finest stretches of beach in @entity67			1
many beaches along the @entity69 and @entity70 remain undiscovered by tourists and unspoiled by development			2
many of them face west , so they produce great sunsets			0
the best known is @entity76 , a 45 - minute flight from @entity8 , where almost two miles of white sand are lined with palm trees overlooking the @entity70			1
here , you 'll find a number of large resorts			0
less developed is @entity83 , a beautifully unspoiled beach that 's a five - hour drive from @entity8			1
also called @entity88 , its eight - mile ( 13 kilometers ) stretch makes it one of the longest beaches in @entity67			1
the @entity90 is n't censored anymore , but it 's still slow the @entity90 arrived in @entity2 in 2000 , but high prices and slow connections mean it 's still not widely used			1
under the former government , websites such as @entity94 and @entity95 were blocked , but restrictions have largely been lifted and last month @entity99 chairman @entity98 visited the country			2
far more popular than the @entity90 are mobile phones , though here , too , prices are high compared with other @entity67 countries			1
local it firms are lobbying to introduce cheaper sim cards and a breakthrough is expected soon			2
a u.s. $ 15 sim card for mobile phones will be made available in june , in the run - up to the @entity110 to be held in @entity2 in december , but will be available only to foreigners			1
you 'll need plenty of cash -- and make sure it 's clean there are few atms in @entity2 , so visitors need to bring plenty of @entity120 dollars			1
the higher the denomination , the better the exchange rate			0
your greenbacks should be squeaky clean -- that means no creases , stains , marks or tears			2
a note that 's folded or even a little worn is worthless in @entity2			1
at present , credit cards are accepted only in five - star hotels and up - market shops and restaurants , usually with a 2 - 3 % fee added to the bill			2
by the end of the year , credit cards should be more widely accepted			0
the local currency is the kyat ( pronounced " chat " ) and @entity120 $ 1 will get you about 882 kyat			0
the new 10,000 - kyat note ( less than u.s. $ 12 ) is the highest denomination -- be prepared for a bulging wallet			1
there 's little worry about carrying a lot of cash			1
crime against foreigners is rare and the @entity2 -- the vast majority of whom are @entity154 -- are generally honest			1
@entity2 records 1 million tourists , surge in tourism income 5			1
a kissing sound gets you a beer when the @entity2 want to get a waiter 's attention they make a kissing sound , usually two or three short kisses			1
it 's the sort of sound you might make if calling a cat			2
@entity169 in @entity8 's @entity170 and you 'll hear that kissing sound a lot			2
this narrow , pedestrian - only street is where the @entity2 come to drink			1
restaurants line either side of the street and chairs and tables are set out in front			0
the local brew is @entity180 and it 's cheap -- about 60 cents for a glass of draught			1
this is prime people - watching territory and if you keep an eye out you 'll spot @entity8 's hip - hop royalty on the prowl			1
just do n't expect to see any females			0
most @entity2 women -- married and single -- stay home in the evening			1
that 's not to say @entity196 women are n't welcome			2
it 's understood that foreigners have different customs			2
hotels are expensive room rates shot up 350 % last year , which means that a room that cost @entity120 $ 25 a night in 2011 now goes for almost @entity120 $ 100			2
it 's a simple matter of supply and demand			2
since the country opened up , business travelers and tourists have been packing flights to @entity2			1
there are a lot more visitors -- more than a million last year -- but roughly the same number of hotels			2
more hotels are on the way , but they take time to build and the hotel shortage is expected to continue five to 10 years			1
a lot of hotels are renovating and since they do n't want to miss out on the visitor boom , they 're staying open while upgrading			0
when making a reservation it 's worth checking to see if any work is in progress and , if so , requesting a room away from the noise			1
@entity2 hit by severe hotel shortage 7			1
the men wear skirts the traditional @entity2 dress is the longyi , a wraparound skirt worn by men and women			1
men tie theirs in the front and women fold the cloth over and secure it at the side			0
@entity246 leader @entity245 is known for her beautiful longyis and tailored tops			0
her high - profile appearances have helped boost the popularity of the traditional dress among young women in @entity2			1
as for what 's worn underneath , that 's a matter of personal preference			0
in the cities , @entity2 men usually wear underwear beneath their longyis when they go out , but at home wear it as the @entity261 wear their kilts			1
in the countryside , underwear is much less common -- for men and women			0
as one man jokingly put it : " @entity266 are great			0
" that 's a plus , especially when the summer temperature tips 104 @entity270 )			0
it 's completely acceptable for a foreigner to wear a longyi and can be a conversation starter			0
the food is exceptional it 's considered rude to eat with the left hand as this is the hand used for personal hygiene			0
to spell that out -- the left hand does the job of toilet paper			0
so eating -- as well as giving money -- is always done with the right hand			1
a typical @entity2 meal includes steamed rice , fish , meat , vegetables and soup and all the dishes arrive at the same time			1
the @entity2 use their fingertips to mold the rice into a small ball and then mix it with various dishes			1
as is the norm , @entity298 usually avoid eating beef and the @entity301 do n't eat pork			0
meals are served with plenty of condiments -- from sweet to savory -- and everyone has their preferred way of customizing a dish			0
which do you prefer ? 9			0
the trains are seriously bumpy the poor condition of railway tracks means carriages get shaken about			0
this makes for a bouncy ride , but trains are still a great way to see the country			0
@entity2 's trains are slow and have a reputation for running late			1
the most reliable route , @entity8 to @entity34 , takes about 16 hours , assuming no delays			0
on overnight trains , there 's more chance of getting some shut - eye in an upper class seat than in a sleeper			2
it can get surprisingly cold a few hours after dusk , so it 's smart to bring something warm to wear			2
buses are usually a faster option , but they 're often crowded			0
domestic flights are the most comfortable way to cover long distances and relatively cheap			0
@entity8 has a newspaper vendor on every street corner after five decades under a repressive military regime , the @entity2 are enjoying their newfound press freedom and showing a healthy appetite for news			1
in the past , all publications had to submit their stories to the @entity347 for approval			0
censorship was gradually phased out in 2012 and at the beginning of this year the bureau was formally abolished			0
under the former ruling military junta , @entity2 had a reputation for jailing anyone who dared voice opposition ; that included many in the media			2
last year was the first year since 1996 that no journalists were jailed			0
@entity2 journalists who fled the country and were forced to live in exile are slowly returning			1
april 1 was a landmark for the country 's media			2
for the first time since 1964 , daily newspapers were permitted			0
it 's a big step for press freedom , but there are concerns that some of the popular weekly newspapers will struggle to make the transition to daily circulation			1
the people with red teeth are n't vampires chewing betel nut is a national pastime			0
small street stalls selling the palm - sized green leaves are everywhere			0
the leaves are filled with hard squares of betel nut , spices and sometimes a pinch of tobacco and then folded up and popped in the mouth and chewed			0
you have to chew a while before you feel the mild narcotic effect of the betel nut			0
at about 6 cents a wrap it 's a cheap hit , but there 's a downside			0
not only does betel nut stain your teeth a reddish - brown , the little packages are spat out on the floor when finished -- making for messy sidewalks			2
it 's also highly addictive			0
