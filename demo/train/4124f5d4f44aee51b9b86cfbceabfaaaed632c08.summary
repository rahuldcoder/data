-- the @entity1 markets the @entity2 as the ultimate game , the ultimate contest			1
helmets clash like gladiators in ancient @entity7			2
stadiums resemble coliseums -- especially those without a roof			2
the contest is macho all the way			2
players talk about " manning up " ( not a reference to the quarterback family ) and other testosterone - leaning terms			1
other than a few party - oriented commercials , football is marketed toward men			2
it 's a guy thing , and we ladies are allowed in if we know either when to cheer or how to bring the cheer			2
or so the stereotype goes			2
so it used to be			2
according to @entity31 demographic data , 46 % of the @entity2 viewing audience is female , and more women watch the game than the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 combined			1
that perhaps surprising statistic raises two questions : why ? and , so what ? history of the @entity2 : by the numbers why do women watch the game ? now , we know that women attended the gladiator fights and chariot races in ancient @entity7			1
but today , it may be more than just the blood sport			2
many women are into sports for the same reasons men are : they enjoy the competition			0
the celebrating ( or commiserating ) after			0
but a lot of women are football fans because it 's a family thing			1
my father was a lifelong @entity65 fan , and i 'm proud to carry on the family tradition			1
@entity67 has got to be beaming , knowing i 'm going to my second @entity2			1
he would have loved to hear my stories			0
maybe i 'll tell him one or two while i 'm praying			0
there are lots of studies about the different ways men and women bond , so i find it interesting how the bonding intersects around @entity2 time			1
for women , the score is important if our team is playing			0
but whether we 're watching at home or at the stadium , it 's about being there and being with -- family and friends			1
for the men , it 's also about sharing -- but i suspect it 's about sharing the competition , vicariously			0
but as long as it 's a good game , and brings people together for a positive experience , it does n't matter why			0
there is a " so what , " though -- a practical economic side to women 's interest in @entity96			0
she - conomy.com reports that " women influence the majority of consumer spending across all categories			0
" on the line of scrimmage : football and politics for advertisers and businesses , @entity2 should be a prime time to focus on women			1
sadly , according to a recent article in adweek.com , advertisers have fumbled the ball			1
" in 2013 we saw waitresses turned strippers , scantily clad women tackling each other in the dirt , and a supermodel sloppily kissing a computer programmer , " said writer @entity115			0
this turns off men as well as women			0
so if businesses want their @entity2 commercials to be part of the event , instead of an excuse to check the fridge , they 'd better pay attention to the numbers -- and i do n't mean the roman numerals			1
and while they are at it , they should seriously consider taking it one step further and using the @entity2 -- the most watched sports event of the year -- to promote awareness around issues facing women today			1
use this testosterone - saturated event , for instance , to make clear that while testosterone - driven violence might be entertaining on the field , it does n't belong in the bedroom			0
use the @entity2 to do more than determine the best football team of the year			1
use it to help end one of the most prevalent crimes of the century -- violence again women			0
use it as a warm - up for the @entity160 event on february 14 , in which more than a billion people worldwide will rise to support justice for women			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

according to @entity31 data , 46 % of the @entity2 viewing audience is female
is it the *spectacle* of the battle or a chance to spend time with the family ?
advertisers now know the audience , and cater to the female viewer
