-- speaking saturday at the @entity2 , president @entity1 said it is reasonable to debate alternatives in the war on drugs , but insisted legalizing drugs was n't a valid option in the @entity9			1
@entity1 voiced his view in his first public remarks at the hemispheric event during a meeting of business leaders , where he was part of a panel alongside @entity18 president @entity17 and @entity20 president @entity19			1
the possibility of drug legalization has gained traction in @entity24 , which is being squeezed between suppliers to the south and consumers to the north			0
yet the idea goes against decades of the prohibitionist policy backed by the @entity9 , which is largely followed and enforced in @entity31 and the @entity32			1
@entity19 noted saturday that people in his native @entity20 , too , have called for different ways to approach illicit drugs			1
" sometimes we pedal and pedal and pedal , and we feel like we are on a stationary bike , " he said of the war on drugs			0
" i think the time has come to simply analyze if what we are doing is the best we could be doing , or if we can find an alternative that would be more effective and less costly to society			0
this is a topic of extreme political sensitivity			0
" he added , " one extreme can be to put all users in prison			0
on the other extreme , legalization			0
in the middle there may be more practical policies , such as decriminalizing consumption but putting all the efforts into interdiction			0
" the first thing that regional leaders should do , @entity19 said later at the summit 's opening session , is seriously and collaboratively examine how to tackle drug trafficking " without dogma , without prejudice			1
" " this summit is not going to resolve this issue , " he said			0
" but it can be a starting point to begin a discussion that we have been postponing for far too long			1
" @entity1 earlier saturday left the door open for debate , but made it clear that the @entity9 has a firm stance			1
" i think it is entirely legitimate to have a conversation about whether the laws in place are doing more harm than good in certain places , " @entity1 said			2
" i personally , and my administration 's position is , that legalization is not the answer			2
" much attention in the run - up to the summit was on the drug issue , as well as on leaders from the hemisphere who are not present in the coastal city of @entity93 , @entity20			1
@entity95 's foreign minister told reporters saturday that @entity95 president @entity97 will not attend because of health reasons			2
@entity97 had recently returned to his country from @entity100 , where he underwent cancer treatment			2
@entity100 , which is not a member of the @entity103 , was not invited to join the leaders			2
but there was a last - minute push by @entity108 's leftist president @entity107 to get @entity100 leader @entity109 a seat at the table			1
@entity107 boycotted the summit because of @entity100 's exclusion			1
@entity19 , a key @entity9 ally , said in his opening remarks saturday that it was time to overcome such issues -- calling it unthinkable if @entity100 is not part of the next @entity2 , as well as nearby @entity119			1
the @entity9 has " never been more excited " to work as equal partners with countries in @entity31 , @entity1 said earlier saturday -- a vow that 's been made before by @entity9 presidents , but that nonetheless drew applause from the audience of business leaders			1
the president presented an upbeat assessment of hemispheric relations , touting a 46 % increase in trade between the @entity9 and @entity31 and @entity32 countries			1
" this hemisphere is very well positioned in the global economy , " he said			0
@entity17 spoke of a need for a " virtuous relationship " based on respect and equality among economies , while @entity19 said he welcomed a " change of mentality in relations between north and south			2
" @entity1 pointed out one change he 'd like to see : " i think in @entity31 , part of the change in mentality , is also not always looking at the @entity9 as the reason for everything ... that goes wrong			1
" there are many examples of increased cooperation between the @entity9 and @entity31 , but they are not always flashy and do n't draw the same type of attention that conflicts do , @entity1 said			1
" @entity158 in the press , the attention at summits like this ends up focusing on the controversies , " the president added			0
" sometimes those controversies date back to before i was born			0
" the summit 's start was momentarily overshadowed by two security incidents -- one involving bomb blasts and another involving @entity169 in @entity20 to protect the @entity9 delegation			1
roughly a dozen @entity169 agents and officers are being investigated over early findings that they allegedly brought back several prostitutes to a hotel in @entity93 , two @entity9 government sources familiar the investigation told @entity0			2
the @entity169 personnel have since been sent back to the @entity9			2
separately , two small blasts occurred nearly back - to - back friday in @entity93			0
the explosions -- one near a bus station and another near a shopping mall -- occurred a good distance away from where world leaders were gathering , said @entity186 , a spokesman for the @entity187			0
there were no casualties , and only minor damage was reported , @entity186 said			0
the explosions came on the heels of a similar one earlier in the day near the @entity193 in the capital city of @entity195 , authorities said			0
@entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
