@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's landslide loss in tuesday 's @entity1 @entity6 primary is n't just a 36 - year veteran getting tossed out of office before he wanted to go			1
it 's also the latest blow to the political center in an increasingly polarized @entity11			1
@entity11 race tighter after @entity4 's defeat already , nearly half a dozen moderate senators in both parties are retiring this year			1
some , such as @entity6 @entity16 of @entity17 , made clear in her surprise announcement earlier this year she 's leaving because she can no longer stand the partisanship and inability to get things done			2
@entity16 retirement a blow to @entity11 's ' sensible center ' two years ago , several centrist republicans were toppled by tea party - backed candidates			1
in the case of @entity4 , his opponent , @entity28 , argued successfully to @entity32 voters that @entity4 , a moderate , too often supported president @entity34 's agenda			1
@entity28 , who won with support from tea party - aligned groups from around the country , advocates confrontation over compromise			1
" what i 've said is , and what i continue to believe , certainly , is one side or the other must prevail , and i 'm hoping this candidacy will help move the @entity6 forward to become a permanent majority , " @entity28 told @entity2 on @entity41			2
in the face of his defeat , @entity4 told @entity2 that " people do n't understand the legislative process			1
" to get things done , he said , you have to compromise			0
" some people say , well , we do understand it , and by golly , we 're going to wait until we have majorities in both houses , the @entity54 , where there 's two years , four years , six years , but the country has to keep going in the meanwhile , " @entity4 said			1
as @entity4 left his election night headquarters after giving his concession speech , the 80 - year - old senator instructed campaign aides to distribute a statement that was quite extraordinary in the annals of politics			1
it was partly a detailed defense of his ill - fated and often maligned campaign strategy and partly a stark warning to both parties about the divisive state of @entity75 politics , starting with @entity28			1
" his embrace of an unrelenting partisan mindset is irreconcilable with my philosophy of governance and my experience of what brings results for @entity84 in the @entity11			0
in effect , what he has promised in this campaign is reflexive votes for a rejectionist orthodoxy and rigid opposition to the actions and proposals of the other party , " @entity4 wrote			2
he also said if @entity6 continue to make it difficult for legislators to find compromise , " we will be relegated to minority status			0
parties do n't succeed for long if they stop appealing to voters who may disagree with them on some issues			0
" @entity4 's parting words : part defense , part warning but @entity75 sen. @entity106 of @entity107 , a @entity6 swept into office on the @entity37 wave two years ago , suggested @entity4 's harsh words for many in his party were mostly about his own personal loss			1
" these elections are tough battles , and people probably have hard feelings when they do n't win			0
but the fact of the matter is that people like me -- and i think also people like @entity28 , people that actually had @entity37 support -- we love this country			2
we are so concerned about the fact that we are burdening our children , grandchildren with debt that is simply unsustainable , " @entity106 told @entity2			0
though most senators willing to cross party lines are either gone , or in the case of sen. @entity135 , moved enough toward the base of their party to stay alive , there are a few exceptions			0
to win in @entity141 @entity140 , the @entity6 plays up crossing party lines , in this new ad called " @entity144			0
" it features a clip from @entity147 's " @entity146 " describing @entity139 as " unpredictably independent , and beholden to no one			0
" the problem for @entity4 is he tried that in his @entity6 primary in the red state of @entity1			2
it may have worked in times gone by , but in 2012 politics , his argument that he reaches across the aisle was a negative for @entity4 , something he lamented in the face of his landslide loss			2
" we have been a factor in pulling people together so we reach decisions			0
the public as a whole may be unhappy with one party or the other , but they 're very unhappy with the @entity170 as a whole for their inability to make decisions , " @entity4 said			0
@entity2 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
