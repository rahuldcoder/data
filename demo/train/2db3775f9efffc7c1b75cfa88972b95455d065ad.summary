@entity0 , @entity1 -- rep. @entity3 of @entity1 remained in critical but stable condition in a @entity0 hospital monday as her alleged would - be assassin made his first appearance in court			1
the alleged shooter , @entity10 , 22 , briefly appeared in a @entity12 courtroom to formally hear the charges against him			1
if convicted , he could face the death penalty			1
a preliminary hearing was set for january 24			1
@entity10 is accused of opening fire outside a @entity0 supermarket where @entity3 was meeting with constituents saturday			1
six people -- including a federal judge -- were killed and 14 others were wounded in the attack			2

he is planning to travel to @entity0 on wednesday , according to two senior administration officials			1
the @entity43 , which rarely alters its public sessions , observed the occasion by convening 10 minutes early to ensure that first arguments were completed before the moment of silence			2
@entity1 gov. @entity49 was scheduled to give her official " @entity51 " address monday , but instead she used the occasion to call for unity and express sympathy for the victims			2
debate has swirled around the question of whether saturday 's massacre was partly the consequence of what many observers characterize as a trend of increasingly toxic political rhetoric			2
in his first public statement since the weekend shooting rampage outside the @entity1 supermarket , @entity3 ' husband thanked supporters and expressed condolences to the families of other victims			1

" ( we ) can breathe a collective sigh of relief after about the third or fourth day , " he said			0
doctors removed part of @entity3 ' skull during surgery in order to keep the brain from pressing against it if it swells , but the bullet 's front - to - back trajectory did not do as much damage as would have a shot that crossed from one hemisphere to the other , @entity84 noted earlier			1
the next big milestone for @entity3 , @entity84 told @entity2 , will come when doctors decide her condition has improved to the point that breathing tubes can be removed			1
that would be " a huge step forward , " he said			0
