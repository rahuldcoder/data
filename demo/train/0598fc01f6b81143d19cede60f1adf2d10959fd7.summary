-- it was described as a " dramatic shift " and a " bombshell			2
" one writer dubbed it a " stunning change			0
" even the @entity7 , the @entity8 advocacy organization , announced a " seismic shift in @entity10			2
" so it was all the more disheartening that the @entity13 's @entity12 decided to backpedal on its surprisingly welcoming language for @entity8 people and their families from earlier in the week with the release on saturday of the final document from its meeting			0
or it would have been disheartening if the interim report had n't used theological arguments that would virtually have guaranteed that same - sex couples and their families would remain second - class citizens in the church			1
true , the synod 's initial report employed a language of welcome that few @entity8 @entity13 and their friends and allies have ever heard from the @entity32			1
and many participants in the synod did indeed embrace the orientation toward the marginalized that has been a hallmark of @entity39 ' papacy			0
both the synod 's initial draft and final document acknowledged the blessings that can be found in different forms of family life ( although the final draft explicitly limited itself to talking about " a stable and true relationship between a man and a woman " )			0
yet even if the more welcoming language of the synod 's first document had survived subsequent editing , a closer reading reveals that the theological framework it used to articulate its views had its limitations			2
in thinking about families whose lives fall outside the church 's norms , the synod 's initial document took its cues from a theological model first developed at @entity32 , a model that at first had to do with interreligious dialogue			1
but here , instead of teaching that other religious communities have only partial access to the truth about @entity73 , the synod claimed that nontraditional families only partially reflect @entity73 's intentions for human relationships			0
these families have " @entity78 [ of @entity73 ] that have spread beyond [ the church 's ] visible and sacramental boundaries , " the document stated			0
in thinking about them , the synod said it turned " respectfully to those who participate in her life in an incomplete and imperfect way			0
" so , although the language of intrinsic disorder and grave sin -- the vocabulary that @entity13 leaders have so often used to talk about same - sex relationships -- was laudably absent from both the initial draft and the final document , the language that the synod initially proposed still relegated @entity8 persons and others to second - class status			1
if the synod were to have taught that same - sex couples , like those who live in other nontraditional family arrangements , are theologically akin to members of other religions , then implicitly it also would have taught that the only way that they can be fully recognized or received by the church is if they undergo conversion			1
after @entity32 , the council 's theological framework was perceived in some quarters as patronizing and paternalistic			1
the synod 's newer framework might not have fared much better			0
the theological tensions that swirled just underneath the surface of the synod 's original draft may explain much about the seeming backpedaling we have seen			2
that original draft surrounded its positive statements about @entity8 people and same - sex couples with qualifiers -- qualifiers that some commentators missed or downplayed			1
for instance , the draft stated unequivocally that same - sex relationships " can not be considered on the same footing " as opposite - sex marriage , and it prefaced its praise for the sacrificial love of same - sex couples with the caveat that it was not " denying the moral problems connected to homosexual unions			1
" the final version , which received mixed support from synod participants , was less welcoming still : " there does not exist any basis to establish even remote analogies between homosexual unions and the plan of @entity73 for marriage and the family			0
" many believe that the synod reversed course with regard to @entity8 people and same - sex unions			1
but that reversal seems much less dramatic when one considers the full implications of the synod 's much - celebrated initial document			2
far from accepting and celebrating same - sex relationships as the signs of divine and human love that so many people -- gay , straight , @entity13 , @entity165 -- are finding in them , that document actually charted a path where those relationships could at best have only been tolerated in the church			1
it is clear that by avoiding a more searching examination of the presumptions about gender and sexuality that @entity13 theology has inherited , the synod members did not fully confront the truly seismic anthropological , cultural and theological shifts that have occurred in the past few decades			0
for many of the rest of us , it is unfortunate that in rushing to celebrate the steps that the synod took last week toward a more inclusive church , we may have turned a blind eye to theological assumptions that might have given us much pause .			0

@entity32 's interim report *discussing* same - sex couples was *widely* seen as major shift
but theological arguments used suggest it was n't *revolutionary* , says @entity197
commentators were too quick to embrace interim report , @entity197 says
