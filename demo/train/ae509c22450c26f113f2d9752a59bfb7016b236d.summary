-- could it get any worse for @entity2 ? its entire fleet of @entity4 - the most technologically advanced airliner in the world - has been grounded over the risk of a battery catching fire in flight			1
that followed a series of incidents in the last few weeks affecting high - profile early customers of its ground - breaking widebody - @entity17 airlines @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity19			0
after just over a year in service , and with a backlog of around 800 orders , the @entity4 programme -- already delayed almost three years before it began flying passengers in late 2011 -- is again in stasis			1
carriers forced to withdraw their @entity4 from service will demand recompense , while others due to take delivery in the next few months will be frantically making alternative plans			1
@entity34 : dreamliner woes explained with @entity2 vowing to throw all its engineering resources at solving the problem over the next few weeks , it will mean other important projects being sidelined			1
and while a production line geared to turning out dozens of airliners a year can not be simply be switched off , executives will be wondering whether it makes sense to continue producing aircraft that are currently grounded around the world			2
yet , believe it or not , @entity2 bosses may be breathing a sigh of relief that things have turned out as well as they have			1
the @entity53 company 's share price has held up , and while the unprecedented grounding of its entire fleet of 50 @entity4 -- the first time an in - service type has been taken out of action since the late 1970s -- is damaging to @entity2 's image and finances , it may not be catastrophic			1
much depends on what the investigators find			0
the best scenario for @entity2 is that the problem -- centered on two powerful lithium - ion polymer batteries -- is isolated			1
if regulators are convinced that a fix of the way the batteries are built or installed is sufficient -- and that measures are in place to minimize any risks from an overheated battery -- the 787 could be back in service within weeks			1
the battery that grounded @entity2 a much worse case is that the malaise spreads to the entire electrical architecture of the @entity4 , forcing a back - to - the - drawing - board rethink of @entity2 's design philosophy			1
this might take the aircraft out of service for a year or more , and would bring the airframer close to financial meltdown as it battled with a crisis much worse than the delay it experienced getting the 787 to certification			2
this , however , is extremely unlikely			0
while @entity2 took a gamble in creating an aircraft so dependent on electrical systems and composite aerostructures , it has already gone through the lengthy and painful process of convincing regulators the @entity4 is safe			1
that the authorities signed off on an aircraft with such a fundamental design flaw is close to inconceivable			0
as for the other incidents that have beset the type over the past few months -- a fan shaft failure on an engine , an oil leak , a windshield crack -- all can safely be put down to teething problems			0
most new aircraft experience issues of this sort , an inevitable consequence of a test program becoming a production aircraft and the sheer complexity of modern airliner design			0
7 elements that make the @entity4 special the @entity119 , the superjumbo from @entity2 's arch - rival @entity121 , has had its own travails , both pre-certification , when the whole wiring infrastructure was called into question , and after service - entry when cracks were discovered in wing ribs			1
it would be astonishing if the 787 's closest competitor , the @entity131 , due to go into service next year , does not suffer its own bedding - in challenges			2
and , indeed , while you might imagine that executives in the @entity137 city of @entity138 , where @entity121 is based , are relishing their opponent 's travails , that is almost certainly not the case			2
in an industry rightly obsessed with safety , it is in nobody 's interest to imply -- even subtly -- that another 's product comes with any risk to passengers			2
speed , economy , style , range , capacity : all may be product differentiators			0
but never , never safety			0
besides , @entity121 too has staked its reputation on lithium - ion technology			0
the @entity131 , like the 787 , will use these advanced batteries to power systems such as its auxilliary power unit			0
as so often in this duopolistic industry , one manufacturer 's technological step - change is followed by its rival			0
@entity121 remains convinced that its lithium - ion battery architecture will deliver operational economies			0
the grounding of the 787 fleet illustrates not the flaws in @entity2 's industrial culture -- a rush to bring the airliner to market , a degree of over-innovation or a desire to please shareholders by outsourcing too much design and production -- but the rigor of a regulatory regime with a zero tolerance of any mote of imperfection			1
and , for anyone who flies , that is good to know			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity2 's entire fleet of 787 @entity4 has been grounded over a battery fire risk
grounding stalls the @entity4 programme , which has a backlog of about 800 orders
@entity193 says the grounding *demonstrates* the rigor of aviation regulation
best case scenario is that the battery problem is isolated , @entity193 says
