@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the creator of beloved @entity5 game franchises including " @entity6 , " " @entity7 " and the " @entity8 , " wants to make something new			1
" i am really keen to work on something really new , which eventually is going to be important for the future of @entity5 , " he said , through a translator , in an interview here at @entity5 's offices on thursday			1
" i would like to try to do something which might be able to expand the boundary or the definition of video games			0
" @entity3 spoke with @entity2 the day after @entity19 reported that the game visionary would step down as a top @entity5 director and producer overseeing the development of games and products			1
@entity2 has a syndication agreement with @entity19			0
a @entity5 spokeswoman disputed the @entity19 report , which quotes @entity3 telling colleagues that he is ready to retire			2
@entity3 was being sarcastic , but that nuance was lost in translation , she said			2
" @entity3 's role at @entity5 is not changing , " the company said in a statement			1
" he will continue to be a driving force in @entity5 's development efforts			1
" the 59 - year - old video - game pioneer may spend less time working directly on blockbuster games in @entity5 's biggest franchises , he said			1
but he will have a senior role , which involves helping to determine the future direction of @entity5 's hardware and software			1
" we 've got to incorporate something new all the time , " @entity3 said			0
" everything starts from something small whenever we are trying to find out something new			0

as its name implies , " @entity57 " for the @entity59 - held system is the seventh in the go - cart racing series			0
there were more than a dozen " @entity8 " games before the " legend of @entity8 : @entity63 " for the @entity64			2
and who can keep count of how many adventures @entity68 was in before " @entity69 ? " here 's a telling number : @entity3 said the word " new " more than a dozen times in the course of an interview that lasted just under an hour			1
he suggested that with execs like @entity75 , who runs the " @entity8 " series , @entity5 's most prized franchises are in good hands			1
@entity3 said he 's instilled in the teams a desire to make big changes often and constantly perfect their products			2
@entity3 declined to describe his new project in depth			0
he mentioned gyroscopes and wireless proximity communication , both of which are built into the @entity89 , as technologies he 'd like to tap in the future			0
to demonstrate his wacky thinking , he said he had considered working on a digital globe with a map of the world that people could carry around with them			0
ideas for games often come from encounters in @entity3 's own life , he said			1
as legend has it , the idea for @entity102 , a decade - old game in which an alien leads a race of plantlike creatures , sprang from @entity3 's garden			2
" i 'm the person who thinks very differently , " @entity3 said			0
" i 'm the guy who believes in the numerous possibilities of video games			0
even by looking around and taking advantage of the existing video - game technologies , we can certainly make something brand new			0
