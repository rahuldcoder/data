the blaze may have vaporized victims , authorities said			1
@entity4 expected that he 'd face raw emotions , but was surprised that so much anger was directed at him			1
" i 'd been told about it			0
i 'd been warned about it , " he said			0
" but it was worse than i thought			0
i thought people would respond to my willingness to come there			1
i mean , they were screaming about how i took three days to get there			0
" the tragedy occurred saturday			0
@entity4 arrived in @entity0 wednesday			1
" well , the three days we had a dozen people on the scene and i was organizing all kinds of things that were necessary , " he said			1
" and i figured i did n't really need to be in the way of people there when they were trying to put the fire out and that sort of stuff			1
" i would wait till the dust settled to a certain degree and then i would come			0
that 's what i did , but this was not well - received at all			1
" on wednesday , two middle - aged men shouted at @entity4 as he spoke with reporters , calling him an obscene name and challenging him to walk into the heart of the tragedy			1
one of the men , @entity60 , told @entity2 he knew at least half the people who were dead or missing			1
" they should put that guy in prison , " @entity60 said			0
" he 's a murderer ... he should be in prison			2
" " people wanted to throw stones at me			1
i showed up and they threw stones			2
but that does n't accomplish anything , " @entity4 told @entity2 said			1

" they were too busy			0
they did n't want to meet			0

but i 'm not a communications professional			0
" the executive with more than 50 years in the railway business told @entity2 that he could get " quite emotional " talking about the train disaster			0
" they talked about that i had no empathy , or no sympathy , and in fact i have plenty , " he said			1
" i can imagine myself being in that kind of situation and i also would be grieving and i 'd be very unhappy			0
i 'd be very mad about the whole thing so i certainly understand the need to vent			2
but it comes a point where it 's totally unproductive			2

@entity2 asked the railway executive what he believed was the cause of the disaster			0
" well , there 's no question that it 's a brake failure on the train			2
that speaks for itself , does n't it ? " he answered			0
" there 's no sugarcoating that			2

" @entity4 has said that the train engineer reported to railroad managers that he set 11 hand brakes on the train cars before they broke away from their engines			1
on wednesday , the executive said he felt " it 's questionable " whether the engineer indeed did that			2
" our general feeling is now that is not true , " @entity4 said wednesday , adding that the engineer had worked for the @entity9 for " many years " and " had a completely clear safety record up until saturday			1
" police : evidence criminal act may have led to train crash on thursday , the railway executive told @entity2 that the engineer is suspended , and @entity4 has not spoken to him			1
" the investigation is continuing , but if we decide to bring internal charges against the engineer he 's entitled to a full and impartial investigation with his union at his side , " @entity4 said			1
" we 're -- he 's got a big problem on his hands and we 're not trying to make that worse for him personally			2
