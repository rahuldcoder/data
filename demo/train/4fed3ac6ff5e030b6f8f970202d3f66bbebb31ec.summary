" do you think it was fair , what they got ? they did something stupid , but i do n't know			0
i 'm not blaming the girl , but if you 're a 16 - year - old and you 're drunk like that , your parents should teach you : do n't take drinks from other people , " she told @entity16			2
of the victim , @entity0 also says in the interview : " she 's 16 , why was she that drunk where she does n't remember ? it could have been much worse			1
obviously , i do n't know , maybe she was n't a virgin , but she should n't have put herself in that position , unless they slipped her something , then that 's different			2
