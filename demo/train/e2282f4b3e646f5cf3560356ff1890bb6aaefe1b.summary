-- for @entity2 , fighting breast cancer was an uphill battle -- literally			1
she got back on her mountain bike shortly after her diagnosis in february 2007 , smack - dab in the middle of chemotherapy			1
" the treatment is so intense -- it strips everything away			1
you 're physically and completely changed , " says @entity2 , 40			1
" i was trying to retain some sense of normalcy			0
and truthfully , i felt a little badass being on my bike during treatment			1
i was giving cancer the middle finger			1
" @entity0 : my @entity19 in pictures tooling around on a mountain bike during chemotherapy sounds intense , maybe even unadvisable			1
but just the opposite is true : @entity2 was being a model patient			1
in the past , doctors often told cancer patients to take it easy during treatment			1
although the appropriate amount of exercise varies from patient to patient , that conventional wisdom is now considered old hat			0
in fact , new guidelines on cancer and exercise from the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) urge cancer patients to be as physically active as possible both during and after their treatment			1
" the idea that you should be staying put and resting is ultimately doing more harm than good , " says @entity41 , @entity42 , an epidemiologist at the @entity43 , in @entity44			2
@entity41 , who studies the role of physical activity in chronic diseases , presented the guidelines at the @entity54 's annual meeting last week			2
health.com : 30 - @entity57 , no gym required the last thing people overwhelmed by cancer 's psychological and physical impact may want to hear is " exercise more			2
" during treatment , bone - crushing fatigue , nausea , and body - changing surgery -- not to mention the emotional drain of coping with worried children , friends , and life partners -- often puts exercise very last on the list of priorities			2
still , experts now say that exercise may help with -- not add to -- those problems			0
it boosts energy , helps stave off the weight gain often associated with treatment , and provides a psychological pick - me - up at a time when a person 's morale is likely to be battered			2
even small amounts help how much exercise is enough ? the @entity37 recommends 150 minutes of moderate - intensity aerobic exercise per week , which works out to about 20 minutes a day -- the same amount recommended to the general public			0
that said , the organization is realistic about how cancer and its treatment can alter mood and energy levels			1
any kind of activity -- even a short walk -- is better than none , the @entity37 says			0
@entity0 : 5 ways to stay healthy after @entity101 " the risk of inactivity for cancer patients is so great that it 's best to just get started with something , " says @entity41			2
if you begin to feel worse or overtired , @entity41 recommends discussing it with your doctor			0
people who were sedentary before their diagnosis should start by walking for 10 minutes each day , says @entity41 , and gradually increase their time by 10 percent to 15 percent each week until they can do 30 minutes at a stretch , five times per week			2
there may be days when you feel nauseous , exhausted , or utterly despondent			0
but friends or family can help			0
" a lot of it will be up to the caregivers , because they are the ones who will know how to motivate patients facing an uphill battle , " says @entity41			0
" they 're the ones who can say , ' hey , let 's get dressed today , ' and then , ' hey , let 's get dressed and walk around the house			0
' " it 's important to pick an activity you enjoy , says @entity134 , @entity42 , the director of the psychosocial oncology program at the @entity137 , in the @entity139 , @entity138			0
" it is not a one - size - fits - all answer , since patients may be more responsive and adherent to different fitness programs , " she says			0
" it 's important to allow patients a choice and to tailor a fitness program to each patient			0
" fortunately the options are greater than ever before , as exercise programs for cancer patients have become increasingly popular nationwide			2
in 2007 the @entity152 partnered with the @entity153 to provide physical activities designed specifically for survivors , and more and more hospitals are creating their own programs as well			2
cancer patients who are n't willing or able to travel to a facility on a regular basis can sign up for programs that can be delivered by mail , phone , or the @entity164			2
" right now we 're working to develop a variety in the types of programs available , " says @entity41			0
@entity0 : the @entity168 @entity2 -- a longtime mountain biker -- took to the @entity170 hills with a group of women who ride with the @entity174 chapter of @entity175 , a group of amateur bikers , runners , and triathletes affiliated with the @entity179 , a nonprofit advocacy organization based in @entity170			1
" i had no hair , no eyelashes , and no eyebrows , and yet i did n't think they would know i had cancer , " says @entity2			1
" the women were so fun and inspiring , and they never babied me			0
they just let me do my thing at my own pace			0
" how exercise helps dozens of studies have demonstrated the benefits of staying active both during and after treatment			1
regular exercise can help fight the weight gain that often comes with cancer treatment , including breast cancer			1
" it 's about what the typical @entity198 could expect to gain over the course of a couple of years , but it 's happening all at once , " says @entity41			0
but exercise is also important for cancer patients whose treatment can cause them to lose weight			1
prostate cancer , cancers of the stomach and gut , and head and neck cancers can all lead to a significant decrease in muscle mass , as well as a loss of taste and an inability to process certain foods			2
" those patients really need to focus on resistance exercises , " says @entity41			0
" that will help them increase their muscle mass and gain that functional tissue that they need			0
" even though most patients wo n't be able to accomplish the same physical feats they were capable of before their diagnoses , adds @entity41 , staying active helps them achieve " a whole lot more than they would have been able to if they had n't been exercising			1
" @entity0 : fit at any age : your 50s strength workout exercising has more intangible benefits as well			1
in a 2007 study that followed advanced cancer patients who exercised while undergoing chemo , the participants were asked to keep diaries			1
many of them noted the positive mental aspects of exercise			2
" it feels good to have a sense of an everyday life again , " wrote one participant			0
" i have become incredibly energetic , " wrote another			0
in addition to making patients feel normal again , staying active is a way for patients to measure the progress of their recovery			1
@entity2 stuck with her rides all summer while undergoing chemo			1
" they became a real benchmark for me , " she says			0
" the more i would ride , the more i felt like i was getting back to my old self			0
" though @entity2 still ca n't match some of the climbs she conquered pre-diagnosis , mountain biking has helped her make peace with her changed body			1
" the hormone treatment , early menopause , early arthritis , the weight gain , the surgeries -- breast cancer takes a huge toll on your body , " she says			1
" i knew i was going to feel bad no matter what , so i figured i might as well be feeling bad on my bike doing something that i used to do -- and something that people not going through cancer might not be able to do			1
