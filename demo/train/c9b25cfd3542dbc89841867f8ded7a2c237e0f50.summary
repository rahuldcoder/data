-- depending on who you ask , @entity2 's decision to secede from @entity3 was either an unconstitutional split manipulated by @entity7 or a move consistent with international law upholding the region 's right to govern itself			1
the @entity12 and its @entity14 allies say sunday 's referendum vote violated @entity3 's newly reforged constitution and amounts to a thinly veiled attempt by @entity7 to expand its borders to the @entity21 peninsula under a threat of force			1
@entity24 asserts @entity3 president @entity25 was ousted in an illegal coup , which ended @entity3 's constitutional authority			1
@entity7 president @entity28 argues @entity29 should have the right to decide how they want to be governed going forward			1
so who 's right ? " the answer depends on what your perspective is , " said @entity32 , editor of @entity33			0
" the @entity12 is buying into the argument of the @entity3 government , which is that the secession of @entity2 from @entity3 is not constitutional under the terms of the @entity3 constitution , " @entity32 said			1
" the alternative argument is that all peoples have a right of self - determination and that if the people of @entity2 choose not to be part of @entity3 , that is their prerogative in the same way that it was the choice of colonial powers to break away from the imperial powers that claimed them or parts of the former @entity54 were free to head off on their own , " he added			1
@entity3 ' will never accept ' @entity2 annexation , president says the standoff between the @entity12 and @entity7 resembles tension from the @entity60 era			1
" we 'll continue to make clear to @entity7 that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate @entity7 and diminish its place in the world , " president @entity61 said on monday			2
" the international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of @entity3 sovereignty and territorial integrity ; and continued @entity7 military intervention in @entity3 will only deepen @entity7 's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the @entity7 economy , " @entity61 said			1
the @entity12 and @entity14 imposed travel bans and froze assets of senior @entity7 and @entity2 officials			1
the @entity61 administration went a step further by banning entry and freezing all @entity12 assets held by any @entity7 government official or people with close financial ties to 11 people , including advisers to @entity28			1
legal or not , @entity2 referendum will shape @entity3 crisis separate from the vote , @entity2 lawmakers approved a resolution on monday that declared the @entity21 peninsula an independent , sovereign state and requested to join the @entity7			1
@entity28 later in the day signed a decree that recognized @entity2 's independence , the @entity93 said			0
he will address a joint session of @entity97 on @entity2 on tuesday			0
@entity28 spoke with @entity99 chancellor @entity98 recently by phone and stressed the @entity2 referendum was in accordance with international law , including @entity103 1 of the @entity104 regarding the principle of self - determination			0
" it was emphasized that @entity7 will respect the choice of the @entity2 people , " according to a @entity93 statement summarizing that conversation			2
@entity61 told @entity28 during a phone call on sunday that " @entity7 's actions were in violation of @entity3 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " according to the @entity117			1
@entity28 pushed back , according to a statement from the @entity93 , and said the situation in @entity2 is akin to @entity121 's breakaway from @entity122 in 2008			0
" regarding the march 16 referendum in @entity2 , mr @entity28 said that the decision to hold the referendum was in line with international law and the @entity104 , and was also in line with the precedent set by @entity121 , " the @entity93 said			0
" the referendum was organized in such a way as to guarantee @entity2 's population the possibility to freely express their will and exercise their right to self - determination , " it said			2
@entity139 hits back at @entity7 over @entity2 even within @entity2 's @entity144 majority , opinions about the legality of seceding are split			2
voters proudly proclaimed their support for rejoining @entity7 as they stood in line in dreary weather to vote			2
however , one , who was too afraid to speak to @entity0 on camera , proclaimed the referendum illegal			0
the ethnic tatars and younger voters have also questioned the legality of secession			0
many of the @entity157 boycotted the referendum with some leaders calling it " a farce " forced by armed men			0
as the @entity12 and @entity7 attempt to hash out their differences , pressure mounts for @entity28 to move quickly and carefully in resolving the @entity2 crisis , @entity167 , a former @entity12 ambassador to @entity3 , and a senior fellow at the @entity169 told @entity170			1
" he basically has two choices			0
choice @entity172 would be to move fairly quickly to annex @entity2 and that is going to then seem as a very naked land grab and will make it very difficult then for a dialogue to move forward , " @entity167 said			0
" that move will likely mean @entity139 nations will ratchet up the level of sanctions , @entity167 said			0
" the alternative is they take the vote but that the @entity7 do n't move very quickly , " @entity167 said			2
" they let @entity2 basically stay in some limbo status which will create some opportunity perhaps for negotiation that can diffuse this crisis			0
" @entity0 's @entity188 and @entity189 , and @entity191 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0
