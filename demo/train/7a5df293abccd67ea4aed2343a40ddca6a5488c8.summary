@entity3 had one named after her			0
and a recent vice presidential nominee campaigned on one			1
now , after nearly 50 years , the iconic @entity7 airliner is pretty much done			2
overall , say aviation enthusiasts , it 's been a great ride			2
the twin - engine , single - aisle jet 's biggest and first operator , @entity11 , officially retired its remaining fleet of six dc - 9s on monday , leaving only a handful of passenger models operating among foreign airlines and government and military outfits			1
it 's high time to give this plane its due			2
experts credit the @entity23 - 9 with helping to open markets and spark air travel trends that continue today			1
and what about pop culture ? during its peak in the 1970s , the @entity7 became an ultimate status symbol among the world 's emerging @entity30			2
for some , the plane was truly shagadelic			0
@entity33 owner @entity1 bought a custom @entity7 and turned it into a personal fur - lined flying boudoir			1
but while @entity1 was making mile - high - club history , the @entity7 was making travel history			1
airlines embraced this @entity41 plane with engines mounted on the rear , instead of the wings			0
they liked its ability to land easily at airports with shorter runways			2
here 's how the @entity7 's geeky aviation technology helped change @entity51 's travel culture : â € ” longer wing flaps and dynamic engines helped dc - 9s land and takeoff on shorter runways that often served smaller towns			1
â € ” in turn , airlines used the @entity7 to open new shorter routes which connected big cities to smaller ones			2
â € ” and that led to making jetliner travel more accessible to more @entity51			1
bottom line : the @entity7 helped @entity51 who live in smaller towns embrace air travel			1
it 's hard to know for sure , but experts estimate the dc - 9 series has flown perhaps 2 or 3 billion passengers between its first commercial flight on december 8 , 1965 , and its last flight on january 6			1
" i think its age alone puts it in the hall of fame , just on longevity , " said @entity72 , an aviation industry blogger , consultant and research engineer at the @entity75			0
" @entity81 , the @entity7 was incredibly important in building hubs in lots and lots of smallish markets			0
" @entity72 said it had a direct impact on the growth of air travel to smaller cities like @entity91 , @entity92			2
" today that airplane would arguably be too big to serve @entity94 -- because now @entity94 is served by a number of smaller regional jets , " he said			0
" but the fact of the matter is , the @entity23 - 9 really helped make @entity94 an important point on a number of airline maps			2
" affectionate nicknames for the plane stuck			0
some called it the @entity106			0
more powerful versions were called " @entity108			0
" labels like " @entity110 " and " @entity111 " were veiled references to its smoky , loud engines during the early days			0
" as an @entity117 employee i ca n't say enough great things about the @entity119 9 , " wrote @entity0 commenter @entity114			0
the plane 's rear - mounted engines made loading and unloading luggage faster , he wrote , because baggage handlers did n't have to wait for the engines to " spool down " before they could access the bags			1
by the late ' 60s , the buzz was growing and @entity1 wanted one			1
in 1969 he took delivery of a @entity131 -- a longer version than the original -- painted black and stenciled with the iconic bunny logo on the tail			0
the aircraft was dubbed " @entity136			0
" riding this sleek chariot , the @entity33 prince whisked his bright - eyed girlfriend @entity139 on a whirlwind trip to @entity141 and @entity142 in 1970			2
@entity143 posted on @entity144 shows the plane as a high - altitude party palace , complete with a reel - to - reel videotape player , a shower , and a disco			2
in 1977 , @entity150 celebrated the crowning of @entity152 's first @entity3 , @entity153 , by naming a dc - 9 in her honor			1
more recently , the plane played a role in the 2012 election			2
@entity161 presidential nominee @entity160 trusted a @entity7 to ferry his running mate , @entity162 , from stump speech to stump speech			1
by the way , that plane -- built in 1970 -- was the same age as the vice presidential candidate			0
since 1965 , @entity11 -- the first carrier to fly dc - 9s -- has flown a total of 305 of them -- nearly a third of the over 970 that @entity7 manufactured until production ended in 1982			1
this is n't the first time @entity11 has retired the @entity7			1
the @entity176 - based airline got rid of their first fleet of dc - 9s in 1993			1
but 15 years later , it acquired 72 dc - 9s as part of a merger with @entity183			1
it 's been taking those planes out of service little by little until last week , when @entity11 retired its final six			1
( @entity11 said two of those dc - 9s will remain on standby for a few weeks as backup planes			1
) not wanting to ignore a key moment in the history of an aviation icon , @entity11 hosted a small ceremony with cake and balloons on monday at @entity197			1
the @entity7 chosen for the final passenger flight was a 120 - seat series 50 model built in 1978			1
its @entity201 registry number : @entity202			0
aboard the plane was aviation correspondent @entity204 of @entity205			0
" it was bittersweet , " he said , reflecting on the passing of a relic from a different time when on - board @entity209 sounded like science fiction and lighting up a @entity211 was commonplace			2
while still on the ground , @entity204 got a peak inside the flight deck			0
he found no advanced flight management computer and none of the modern , so - called " glass cockpit " digital displays you might find on newer airliners			2
the plane 's instruments were a throwback to 1970s technology -- lots of old - fashioned round , analog dials			1
@entity202 's first airline was @entity230 in ' 78			0
a year later , it was obtained by @entity232			0
it changed airlines again in 1986 when @entity183 swallowed @entity232			0
in 2009 , it got a @entity11 paint job , after @entity11 's mashup with @entity183			1
eventually it was time for @entity204 to board @entity239 for @entity11 's final scheduled dc - 9 passenger flight -- appropriately named @entity241 -- from @entity197 to @entity176			1
once in the air , the crew led passengers in a quick champagne toast to honor the aircraft			0
by the way , another storied airliner from the same era , the @entity247 , will reportedly make its final passenger flight in february from @entity252 , @entity253 , to @entity254 , @entity255			0
the @entity7 leaves behind a powerful design legacy that will fly for years			0
aviation geeks point to what they call " variants " of the plane which are still going strong , including the @entity262 series -- the @entity262 and the @entity263			0
another plane with design roots reaching back to the @entity7 is the @entity266 717			0
these planes all look a lot like the @entity7 , with their rear - mounted engines -- and of course that cool - looking @entity41			0
to replace the dc - 9s and other retiring planes , @entity11 is acquiring 36 717s this year from @entity274 and another 36 in 2015			1
the 110 - seat 717s have a range that will allow them to fly all of the airline 's domestic routes			1
by 2017 , @entity11 also plans to add 40 @entity281 planes to its fleet , including the international widebody @entity283 and -- for domestic routes -- the single - aisle @entity285			1
@entity11 also is the process of buying 100 new @entity289 - @entity288 to replace older 757s and 767s			1
get ready for a lot more airliners to retire between now and 2019			0
the aviation consulting firm @entity293 predicts more commercial jets will be retired worldwide this decade than ever before -- somewhere between 6,000 - 8,000			2
compare that to about 1,700 commercial jets that were retired in the entire 1990s			0
the time is right for airlines to buy newer planes , experts say , because interest rates are relatively low , and higher fuel prices require newer , efficient engines			0
as for the exiting dc - 9s , one will be handpicked for permanent display at the @entity306 in @entity176			1
" it was a robust workhorse of an airplane , " said @entity11 spokesman @entity307			2
" its longevity proves how robust it was			0

born in 1965 , dc - 9s opened jet routes to small airports , spurring travel
@entity11 , the last @entity51 carrier flying dc - 9s , officially retired its fleet on january 6
@entity1 had one ; 2012 *vp* nominee @entity162 campaigned in one
@entity11 's final five series 50 dc - 9s will be sold off , another will go to a *museum*
