-- over the past week , speculation emerged that former secretary of state @entity2 might not be the only prominent @entity4 running for the nomination for president in 2016			1
her " inevitable " path to the nomination is once again being questioned			0
in @entity10 , @entity9 launched the debate with an article titled , " @entity13 ? a @entity14			1
" @entity9 focuses on the possibility of the @entity17 senator running on a campaign centering on the issues of economic inequality , restoring the middle class and regulating @entity22			0
" what we need is a system , " @entity23 has said , " that puts an end to the boom and bust cycle			0
a system that recognizes we do n't grow this country from the financial sector ; we grow this country from the middle class			0
" comparing such a contest to the race between @entity39 and @entity40 in the 2008 primaries , the article suggests that @entity23 could re-energize @entity42 who feel disillusioned by the past five years			1
watching this unfold , some commentators have predicted that a civil war might be brewing between the progressive and moderate wings of the party			1
@entity50 , the insightful commentator and @entity0 contributor who has been a prominent critic of what tea party @entity52 have done to his @entity52 , warned that " where @entity42 have scored successes since 2010 , those successes have been owed less to occupy - style militancy , and much more to the seeming unquenchable determination of @entity52 to render themselves unelectable			1
" competition within the party does n't have to be a negative ; democrats could turn this to an advantage that helps candidates who enter the race to focus and refine their message about the economy in a way that would make for a powerful campaign theme			2
it would be a mistake for @entity42 to think that the entry of @entity23 , or a candidate similar to @entity23 , into the race would somehow create problems or even a " left - center " divide			1
the notion that dealing with economic inequality represents the " progressive " wing of the party as opposed to the mainstream is an extremely flawed way for @entity42 to think of their party			1
painting @entity23 's concerns as being to the left ignores how tackling these kinds of economic challenges have been at the heart of the @entity14 for almost a century			1
mainstream @entity42 have usually done best when they have kept their eye on these questions and put forth policies that address the problem of middle class security			1
during the 1930s , president @entity96 made this the centerpiece of his @entity100			0
most of his policies centered on providing economic support , such as creating old age pensions , protecting unions and providing unemployment compensation as well as creating public jobs to help @entity108 make it through the crisis of the @entity111 and to serve as a foundation for their future			0
the policies revolved around a vision of " moral capitalism , " according to the historian @entity117			0
his programs proved to have widespread appeal and provided the foundation for a durable coalition of industrial workers , farmers , progressive activists and african - americans that would last for decades			1
during the 1960s , president @entity127 continued along these lines by tackling the problem of economic inequality through programs that aimed to bolster the strength and size of the middle class			0
the war on poverty sought to help the poor become self - sufficient and enter the marketplace			1
@entity139 guaranteed that middle - class families could count on health insurance when they retired and would n't be overwhelmed by medical costs of their parents			2
federal education assistance offered affordable loans to @entity108 who wanted to attend college and money for local schools to ensure that all children received an adequate education			0
food stamps provided food security for struggling families			0
civil rights laws gave african - americans access to public space , employment opportunities and voting rights that were central to full citizenship			2
while @entity52 rebounded as controversy over @entity163 and the war on poverty grew , the programs in fact survived and remained quite popular			2
@entity52 have either learned to live with them and , in some cases , have expanded them			0
democrats in @entity169 were often able to succeed in the @entity170 by fighting back against @entity52 who try to dismantle the welfare state			0
starting in 1982 , @entity42 regained their footing in the @entity173 during the midterm elections based on campaigns about economic fairness			1
when congressional @entity52 conducted a full - scale assault on @entity139 and other programs in 1995 , president @entity40 stood his ground and rebounded to a landslide r - election victory the following year			2
indeed , @entity40 , usually tagged as a hard - core centrist , devoted considerable energy to the cause of middle - class @entity108			0
in his 1992 campaign , he hammered away at president @entity186 for his inability to deal with the recession and failure to sympathize with the economic concerns of average @entity108			0
while @entity40 could n't persuade @entity169 to pass his health care reform that aimed to broaden access and lower costs in the insurance system , he did find support for smaller measures , such as the @entity197 , that have proved to be popular			0
despite the characterization of @entity2 as a market - based centrist , she has frequently addressed these themes throughout her career , including while in the @entity203 , and in 2008 made it clear that she would be a president who fought for the middle class			1
while @entity40 , as her critics have said , has ties to the financial community and is not in any way an opponent of big business or big finance , she has also been a strong defender of the social safety net and programs that help the middle class grow			1
in 1978 , @entity17 sen. @entity218 warned his party about veering too far to the center under president @entity221			2
in words that @entity42 should heed , @entity218 said : " we are heirs to a great tradition in @entity108 public life			2
our party took up the cause of jobs for the unemployed in the @entity111			0
our party took up the cause of civil rights for black and brown americans , and the cause of equal rights for women in @entity108 and the people of the @entity236			0
" although @entity218 did not win the nomination in 1980 ( for many reasons outside of his policies ) , his speech offers an important message for @entity42 thinking about 2016			1
it would be a mistake for @entity42 to break off into opposing camps , with some tackling these so - called " leftward " issues and others sticking to the " center			1
" a better bet , based on the record , would be to put these questions front and center in the primaries and see which candidate offers the best and most aggressive response to the challenges that have faced middle - class @entity108 in recent decades			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			2

*pundits* speculate sen. @entity264 could oppose @entity2 for 2016 run
@entity261 : predictions of left - *vs.* - center war among @entity42 are *misplaced*
he says a progressive message is crucial to the heart of the @entity14
@entity2 has strong ties to business but also believes in social safety net , he says
