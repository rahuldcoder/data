@entity0 -- engineers will need six to nine months to bring the damaged nuclear reactors at the @entity7 power plant to heel , the plant 's owners said sunday in their first public timetable for ending the crisis			1
it will take three months to reduce the levels of radioactivity in the plant and restore normal cooling systems in the reactors and spent fuel pools , the @entity10 announced			1
another three to six months will be needed before the reactors are fully shut down and new shells are built around their damaged housings , the company said			2
meanwhile , @entity22 's government said it would try to decontaminate " the widest possible area " in that period before deciding whether the tens of thousands who have been forced to flee their homes will be allowed to return , said @entity28 , an adviser to @entity22 prime minister @entity29 " we have to go step by step in order to resolve the problems one by one , " @entity28 said			1
the timetable was released five days after @entity36 called for @entity10 to show @entity22 a pathway to ending the worst nuclear accident since the @entity39			1
a day earlier , the company would not comment on an industry group 's estimate that restoring normal cooling would take two to three months -- a period comparable to the first stage of sunday 's plan			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity47 acknowledged that public pressure helped speed the company 's decision to release a plan and warned that the outline remained tentative -- " but we will do our best " to stick to it , he said			1
because of the still - unknown volume of highly irradiated water flooding the basements of units 1 - 3 , where the cooling equipment is normally housed , the utility is working toward building a separate cooling system			2
that system would remove heat from the water being pumped through the reactors and decontaminate it before circulating it back through them			0
currently , engineers have improvised by pumping roughly 170 metric tons ( 45,000 gallons ) of water a day into each reactor , an unknown portion of which is leaking out			2
the leaking water comes out full of such particles as radioactive iodine and cesium , the byproducts of the reactors			0
at the plant on sunday , workers used remote - controlled robots to record radiation , water and temperature data in the building that houses reactor no. 3			1
photos released by the utility showed the devices , provided by the @entity92 company @entity91 , opening the inner door to the reactor and entering the darkened building			1
" everything is a high - radiation area inside the reactor buildings , " @entity47 told reporters at a briefing for international news outlets -- another first for a company that has been sharply criticized for its handling of the crisis			1
meanwhile , @entity10 chairman @entity104 fended off nearly a dozen questions from @entity22 reporters about whether he or other top executives planned to resign as a result of the disaster			1
" at this point , we do not have any decisions or discussions about resigning , as all our efforts is towards resolving the situation , " @entity104 said			0
" we are not sure if resigning is the best way to take the responsibility or to stay in position to resolve the situation			0
" any decisions may wait until the company 's general shareholders meeting in june , he said			2
the 5 - week - old crisis began march 11 , when the plant was swamped by the tsunami that followed northern @entity22 's historic earthquake			2
the 14 - to 15 - meter ( 45 - to 48 - foot ) wave knocked out the plant 's coolant systems , causing the three reactors operating at the time to overheat			0
the results included two spectacular explosions that blew apart the housings of the no. 1 and no. 3 reactors and the release of a massive amount of radioactivity that has shrunk considerably , but continued sunday			1
the wild card in the utility 's plan may be reactor no. 2 , where another suspected buildup of hydrogen is believed to have ruptured the suppression pool -- a doughnut - shaped reservoir at the base of the reactor			1
that may make it more difficult to carry out one of the first stages of their planned cooling process , filling the concrete primary containment shell around the reactor pressure vessel with water , @entity47 said			0
unless that damage is repaired somehow , that part of the plan may be unsuccessful , he said			0
@entity10 also plans to build a new structure to support the no. 4 unit 's spent nuclear fuel pool , around which fires -- the cause of which has yet to be determined -- severely damaged a nearby building			1
@entity28 said there is no indication this pool is compromised or leaking highly radioactive water or fumes , calling the planned structure a protective measure given concerns about considerable damage to the main no. 4 nuclear reactor building			1
@entity22 's government declared @entity7 a top - scale nuclear disaster last week , warning residents of several towns outside the current 30 - kilometer ( 19 - mile ) danger zone around the plant to evacuate or prepare to leave their homes			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity187 visited the stricken area sunday , including a brief trip into the 20 - kilometer radius from which all residents have been ordered out			0
clad in a white protective suit and face mask , @entity187 got within about 15 kilometers of the plant as he met with police who are still searching the area for victims of the march disaster			0
" ensuring people 's livelihoods and security is our foremost priority , " @entity187 said after meeting with the governor of @entity200 , @entity201			0
radiation levels in the area are not high enough to cause immediate health effects , but prolonged exposure could cause an increased risk of cancer , according to government data and reports from outside researchers			2
in @entity218 , a village @entity187 visited sunday , government figures released sunday show cumulative doses of radiation since the accident are already more than half the 20 - millisievert limit the government set for long - term evacuations			2
@entity218 is about 40 kilometers northwest of the plant , outside the danger zones drawn in the early days of the crisis			0
@entity28 said the government does not yet know how much of the contaminated areas can be cleaned up , but added , " we will try to decontaminate as much of an area as possible			0
" workers stopped a severe leak of contaminated water into the @entity234 on april 6 , but elevated levels of the short - lived nuclear waste @entity236 recorded over the weekend could indicate a new problem , a @entity22 safety official announced saturday			2
iodine concentrations sampled saturday around the no. 2 water intake were 6,000 times @entity22 's legal standards , up from 1,100 times on thursday and down slightly from friday 's figure of 6,500 times			2
that number is far below the levels recorded when the earlier leak was spewing radioactive iodine into the ocean at 7.5 million times the limit			0
authorities have built a silt and placed steel plates around the intake fence to corral the contamination since april 6			0
@entity236 has a radioactive half - life of eight days , and the increase could be either from a fresh leak or from sediment stirred up while placing steel panels around the intakes , said @entity263 , the top spokesman for @entity22 's @entity264			0
" they will continue to monitor this carefully , " @entity263 said			0
" at this point , they have not visually found any leakage of any water into the ocean , and it is hard to check the conditions around ( reactor ) no. 2 due to high radiation levels			1
" @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity1 's @entity280 contributed to this report for @entity1 .			0

new : @entity10 plans a new structure to support the no. 4 unit 's spent nuclear fuel pool
robots probe darkened reactor no. 3
radiation readings in one town are halfway to the government 's evacuation threshold
@entity10 says it will take 6 to 9 months to wind down the nuclear crisis
