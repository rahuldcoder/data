-- @entity1 sang with such a gentle voice that it 's easy to forget how his music drove a fierce , radical movement for change			1
" young people in the civil rights movement began to realize that music was like a weapon you could use , but it was a nonviolent weapon			1
so you did n't have to feel powerless			2
you had this weapon , and it was a beautiful song , " said @entity13 in a phone interview from her @entity16 home			2
her husband , @entity18 , is one of the musicians , along with @entity1 and @entity20 , credited with adapting the song " we shall overcome " from an earlier hymn			1
they were more vessels than songwriters			2
they became instruments through which the words of oppressed individuals got a hearing			2
@entity1 , @entity13 and others lifted up anonymous voices , and these voices changed the world			1
for 17 years , i 've been working closely with nonprofit organizations that are advocating for causes			2
they deploy lots of @entity40 shows			2
it 's nearly unimaginable a nonprofit executive would put music front and center in an advocacy campaign			1
yet that is what happened in the civil rights movement			1
i called @entity50 a few years ago , when he was still granting interviews , to ask him whether the music came to be important through some kind of happy accident , or whether it was intentional			1
turns out music was front and center by design			1
some of the credit goes to @entity61 folk schools			1
that 's where @entity63 saw firsthand how to deploy culture in training individuals to take on social and political causes			0
a @entity16 native educated in @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity63 co-founded @entity71 in 1932			0
as in the @entity61 schools he visited , music was central			1
his wife , @entity75 , classically trained in music , led @entity71 's music program and helped create the anthems we associate with the civil rights movement			1
highlander hosted and trained the @entity83 names from the civil rights movement , including the rev. @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
they mixed with folk musicians such as @entity1 and @entity13			1
and everyone mixed with men and women who would never become famous -- just folks fighting for the right to vote , to move about freely and to speak freely			2
the right to be recognized as human beings , in short			0
this pre-internet caldron of connectivity -- civil rights leaders and musicians and ordinary men and women mixing together in common cause -- scared the dickens out of people who derived power from the status quo			1
authorities could arrest people and beat people			0
they just could n't stop the singing			0
@entity13 taught " we shall overcome " to young people in 1960 at the founding meeting of the @entity115 at @entity116			0
" @entity117 wanted me down there to teach that song , " @entity13 said			0
" there is power in the words and the songs and the people			2
" two weeks before , he had been at highlander teaching " we shall overcome " to one of the first gatherings of the students who would lead sit - ins			0
at the same meeting , he taught students to sing " i 'm gon na sit at the @entity133 " and " @entity134			0
" it all seems so harmless now , these beautiful songs			0
but singing those songs could result in a beating			0
music was gasoline on the civil rights fire , and @entity71 was effectively a music distribution hub			1
so tiny little @entity144 , @entity16 , home to @entity71 , became a threat to the most powerful people in the country			0
@entity150 state officials sent a spy to @entity144 and ran a smear campaign against @entity85			1
a congressional committee went after @entity1			1
the state of @entity16 shut down @entity71 and seized the land			0
" there 's great nostalgia for these songs , " @entity13 says			0
" they have become part of @entity162 culture			2
but at the time , the songs were threatening			0
it helped people feel united			0
" nothing is more threatening to power than seeing opponents organize			2
it 's easier to hold off a bunch of unhappy individuals , each isolated and harmless			0
it 's tougher to resist a bunch of unhappy individuals who unite and work together			0
or as @entity176 describes in his anti-war song " @entity179 , " if one person sings alone , authorities will think he 's crazy			0
if 50 people sing out together , they will see it 's a movement			2
" @entity1 understood how powerful music could be , " @entity13 said this week , reflecting upon his death			1
" he thought it could change the world			0
not all of us would go that far , but he really believed that			0
" @entity1 described his banjo as a machine that surrounds hate and forces it to surrender			1
