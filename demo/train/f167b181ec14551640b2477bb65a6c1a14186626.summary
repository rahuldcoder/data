it 's a political axiom that the closer @entity2 gets to an election , the less work it gets done			1
but here 's the current math : what 's less than nothing ? and if you do even less than nothing , at what point does it become completely counterproductive and silly ? we 've reached it			2
have you noticed lately that real ideas are out of vogue ? a serious @entity18 committee chairman makes a big â € ” and , yes , controversial -- proposal to reform the tax code			1
here 's how his ultimate leader , house speaker @entity22 , reacts when asked about parts of the plan : " @entity25 , blah , blah blah			1
the president , who once endorsed an idea to change the way @entity30 benefits are calculated as a way to curb its growth , has now said " never mind			1
" it wo n't be in his budget , for fear that his liberal base would desert him over it			2
republicans , who started the year saying that immigration reform should be on the agenda , are now saying , as the speaker put it , the president ca n't be " trusted " to implement any serious measure			1
and @entity45 say the president ca n't be trusted to do a trade agreement without angering the important constituency of organized labor , so bye - bye " fast track " trade bill			2
bill to help veterans fails truth is , it is n't about trust at all			2
it 's about winning in 2014			1
and an important part of winning , it seems , is to paper over all dissent within your own party in order to present a united front to the voters			0
so the election will be this : @entity69 or them ? obamacare or no @entity72 ? do you like me better ? do you like government ? do you like poor people or rich people ? that 's our debate -- the sum total of our big ideas right now			1
not wanting to start any fights within your own party			0
unity above all heading into the midterm elections			0
so maybe @entity2 should just close up shop and leave town because nothing is going to happen for the next nine months			1
just turn off the lights			0
both parties are making the same political calculation for the same reason : they ca n't afford to have any internal debate lest they seem less than united against the enemy			2
turns out that the permanent campaign is still alive and well			0
here 's the glitch in this narrative : voters , it turns out , actually want some solutions to problems			2
they want to see the deficit go down ; they want to find a way to fix immigration			0
a majority ( 63 % ) is worried the country is on the wrong track			0
and , according to a new @entity113 / @entity112 poll , eight in 10 @entity69 are fed up with @entity114			0
somehow , voters have n't gotten the message that @entity2 -- in its steadfast intent to accomplish nothing -- is just trying to appeal to them			1
but remember what happened to @entity121 's campaign			2
@entity121 lost for lots of reasons , but one of them was sticking too long to the assumption that if people were unhappy with the direction of the country and the other guy , that would be enough to win			0
and ideas mattered , too			0
the " big " @entity18 idea this time is to bash @entity72 , relentlessly , endlessly , in a continual loop			1
sure , it 's unpopular , but what about if it starts working for people ? what if people are sick of hearing about it now that the website is working ? and what if people are more inclined to mend it than end it ? if @entity72 is the only trick in the bag , it might not be enough			1
then there 's the @entity45 ' income inequality refrain			0
it 's not new , it can work , and sure , it unites the @entity45			1
but by taking almost everything of substance off the table , it 's the president 's legacy and record of achievement that gets compromised , along with the voters			0
the truth is this : it 's a tight political fight			0
polls right now show that the public , by a small 42 % -39 % margin , would back @entity18 for office in the 2014 midterm elections			1
they 're not thrilled with the president 's job performance			0
they have soured on the president personally , and they can barely stomach the @entity2			1
so what 's the political solution ? no substance , no ideas , no serious debate that might actually engage voters			0
each side suits up , armed with its slogans and its bromides			0
and we inevitably re-elect the @entity2 we hate .			1

@entity187 : it 's a given that @entity2 does little *approaching* an election
she says it appears that in 2014 , @entity2 will do even less than *normal*
@entity18 is betting that it can win on @entity72 *criticism* , but what if that does n't work , she asks
@entity22 *snubs* tax reform ; @entity200 *drops* @entity30 changes
