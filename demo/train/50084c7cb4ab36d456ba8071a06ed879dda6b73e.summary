@entity0 -- the sweeping health care reform law championed by president @entity3 was upheld as constitutional by another federal appeals court tuesday			1
the decision is not part of a half - dozen other appeals pending at the @entity8			1
the justices could decide this week whether to take on one or more of those legal challenges to the law			1
those suits were brought by more than a two dozen states and a coalition of private groups and individuals			0
tuesday 's 2 - 1 decision by the @entity18 is a victory for the administration and its congressional supporters , but only adds to the divide among a range of federal courts over whether the law should be tossed out or severely trimmed in its scope			1
three appeals court have upheld the law , while one has ruled it unconstitutional			1
the majority in this latest case concluded while the assertion of federal authority in the law is large , so too is the issue @entity32 and the president sought to tackle			1
" the right to be free from federal regulation is not absolute , and yields to the imperative that @entity32 be free to forge national solutions to national problems , no matter how local -- or seemingly passive -- their individual origins , " wrote judge @entity36			1
it is unclear whether the high court will include this latest ruling with the other pending health care cases already on its docket			1
the justices have scheduled a closed - door conference thursday to consider whether to accept one or more appeals			2
if they do , oral arguments would likely be held in march , with a ruling by june			2
one of the other challenges involves a 26 - state coalition opposing the law			2
a federal appeals court in @entity55 , considering that suit , had earlier found a key provision of the law to be unconstitutional			1
the key issue is whether the " individual mandate " section -- requiring nearly all @entity63 to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties -- is an improper exercise of federal authority			2
the states also say that if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional , the entire law with its 450 or so sections must then be scrapped			0
@entity70 and @entity71 have filed separate challenges , along with other groups and individuals opposed to the law			2
the justices now have the discretion to either frame the case around the " severability " question -- whether the individual mandate section can be separated from the rest of the law -- or expand it to include other legal questions raised in the appeals			2
two other appeals have split on the individual mandate 's constitutionality , a " circuit split " that all but assures the @entity8 will decide the matter ultimately			1
the states say individuals can not be forced to buy insurance , a " product " they may neither want nor need			0
the @entity94 has countered the states ' argument by saying that since every @entity63 will need medical care at some point in their lives , individuals do not " choose " to participate in the health care market			0
federal officials cite 2008 figures of $ 43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services , costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers			0
health care reform , a top @entity112 priority since the @entity114 administration , was passed by the previous @entity32 in a series of virtually party - line votes			1
@entity3 signed the act into law in march 2010			0
the law is widely considered to be the signature legislative accomplishment of the president 's first two years in office			0
among other things , the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured @entity63 receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government - imposed mandates and subsidies			0
the federal government stated in court briefs that 45 million @entity63 last year were without health insurance , roughly 15 % of the country 's population			1
critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine , fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy would result in higher taxes and diminished health care services			0
opponents derisively labeled the measure " @entity141			0
" @entity143 leaders , who captured the @entity144 in the midterm elections , have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law			0
the case decided tuesday is @entity148 ( 11 - 5047 ) .			0

the ruling follows several others by appeals courts on the health reform legislations
@entity32 must " be free to forge national solutions to national problems , " the court says
