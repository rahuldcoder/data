-- @entity1 has spent most of his life trying to forget about the stench of death on the island of @entity6 65 years ago			1
@entity1 was a p - 51 fighter pilot who had turned 22 a few weeks before he touched down on the island march 7 , 1945 , amid some of the bloodiest fighting of @entity12 's @entity11 campaign			1
" to one side , there were mounds and mounds and mounds of bodies of @entity20 soldiers being pushed around by bulldozers into mass graves			2
and right behind our squadron area was the @entity28 mortuary , where they 'd lay out the bodies , check their dog tags and fingerprint them for identification , " recalls @entity1 , an 87 - year - old retiree who lives in @entity23 , @entity24			1
" i 've lived with those memories all of my life and it was not something i ever wanted to go back to			0
" nevertheless , @entity1 was back on the island last week for the first time since 1945 to attend a ceremony commemorating the battle 's 65th anniversary			2
about 22,000 @entity20 soldiers died defending the island , along with more than 6,000 @entity43 , in a battle that was memorialized in the iconic photograph of five @entity43 @entity28 and a @entity47 corpsman raising the @entity43 flag atop @entity49 , the island 's dormant volcano			1
the @entity43 secured the island on march 26 , 1945 , marking the @entity43 military 's most significant advance in its island - hopping strategy to reach @entity55			1
but the battle proved to be longer and deadlier than planners had anticipated , depleting much of the @entity43 military 's resources			2
the @entity43 abandoned its plan to invade the @entity20 mainland and turned to the atomic bomb to end the war			1
since 1995 , the @entity20 and @entity43 associations of @entity6 have met on the 8 - square - mile island , now known as @entity6 , to commemorate the 35 - day battle with a " @entity66			1
" @entity1 and several other veterans made the day - long trip to @entity6 from @entity69 on march 3 with the tour company , @entity70			1
each man had his own reason for going , but all left united through the shared experience of an event that only a few can understand , says @entity75 , a @entity28 correspondent who covered the @entity76 , who also made the trip			1
" in a way , it 's reliving something that happened so long ago that was probably what i would consider some of the most ennobling moments of our lives			1
i am a writer , too , so going there this time , looking at the terrain and seeing this hill , this cliff , this gorge , opens a whole new page to the memory , " he says			0
@entity75 , a retired newspaper reporter who is working on a book about his experiences as a war correspondent , has been back to @entity6 for the @entity66 four times			1
but the sense of awe never diminishes as the first sight of the island from the plane , he says			0
" when we approached @entity6 and saw @entity49 , you would be amazed what happens			2
everything became as quiet and as solemn as if we 'd entered a cathedral			0
you could tell the island had captivated everyone , the island had brought them back to their youth			0
the first moment was a very stirring moment			0
always is , " he says			0
for @entity1 , it has been a longer journey back to the battlefield where , as a young airman , he left behind 11 comrades , sparking years of bitterness and racial prejudice			2
@entity1 recalls passing over the flag each time he and his brothers flew a mission to support the @entity28 on the ground , who faced the formidable task of taking the island from a military force on its last stand			1
" i never thought of the people on the ground as people			0
you can hate somebody so much that you do n't see them as people , " he says			0
" i had no desire to go back to @entity55			2
why the hell would you want to visit the place where your enemy was ? who wants to visit the people you fought against and hated ? " the healing began in 1988 , when his son married a @entity20 woman whose father was a pilot in the @entity150 , who also flew missions in @entity6			1
@entity1 's son 's future in - laws opposed the marriage until the men met and shared their experiences in @entity6			1
" i hated him and he hated me			0
we met for the first time three days before the wedding			0
and he said , ' any man that could fly a @entity163 against the @entity20 and live must be a brave man , and i want the blood of that man to flow through the veins of my grandchildren			2
" then , my son got married and started having children and my whole life expanded			2
i saw that human beings were killed in the war , and they were kind people , they were bright people , and now they 're my family			0
" through the marriage , the two wartime enemies made peace , a process that @entity1 documented in a novel published last year , " @entity179			0
" but he still never considered visiting @entity6 until he was offered an opportunity to commemorate his fallen brothers -- 11 in combat and five in training -- from the @entity185 in a ceremony during the @entity66			1
upon learning of his plans , @entity1 's 18 - year - old grandson expressed interest in seeing the place where his grandfathers had once fought each other			2
" i just did n't want to relive all that , but because i have a @entity20 grandson and because he wanted to go , i had to go , " says @entity1			1
" and i 'm happy , delighted , thrilled that i went			0
i cried most of the day , from the moment we landed			0
many memories came back , and we did a memorial for the 16 guys			0
it was like closing the circle			0
