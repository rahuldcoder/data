@entity47 's capture and other decisions opened a vacuum in @entity7 , during which @entity3 - led international forces teamed with their fledgling @entity7 allies to quell ongoing violence			1
it also opened the door for @entity0 to find a new calling as a police officer			2

official documents signed by @entity3 officers praised his intelligence work and declared his efforts had undoubtedly saved @entity3 and @entity7 lives			1
but having such friends did n't mean @entity0 was safe , especially after coalition forces started to pull out of @entity7			1
nor did it mean that everyone was pleased with his work			0
he found that out in 2009 , as he left his @entity5 home to do some shopping			0
" as i was driving my car , it suddenly exploded , " @entity0 said , adding that a " sticky " bomb had been affixed to his car			2
two weeks in a @entity5 hospital were followed by a year at medical facilities in @entity126 , @entity127			2
it left him with his left wrist scarred and deformed , twisted at a jarring angle			0
today , there are prosthetics where the rest of @entity0 's legs used to be , causing him to walk stiffly and awkwardly and to use a cane for balance			2

@entity0 thought he was a dead man			0
" they told me , ' we know you are @entity0 , you were working with the @entity3 troops and @entity7 police , " he recalled			1
the militants showed him some mercy after he showed them the results of the bombing that maimed him			0

they are waiting , like many other @entity7 , for @entity3 diplomats to decide on their asylum application			1
it 's been about a year now			0
@entity0 argues his work with the @entity3 , the injuries he suffered because of that and the continued threats to his life are all reasons he and his family should be allowed to take the 7,000 - mile journey across the @entity199			2
until then , he 's in many ways lost in his homeland			0
