@entity0 -- a federal watchdog took a bite out of military hospitals this month , warning it is impossible to tell if some doctors are licensed , properly trained and evaluated in their specialties			2
" @entity10 oversight and physician credentialing and privileging requirements were not sufficient to assure that @entity13 ( @entity14 ) fully complied with existing requirements or completely documented information needed to support credentialing and privileging decisions , " said the new general accountability office report			1
" specifically , @entity21 's oversight of individual @entity13 ' reviews of physicians ' applications for privileges was insufficient to identify the instances of noncompliance and incomplete documentation , " the report added			2
in some cases the military had failed to check properly on the legitimacy of doctors ' licenses to practice medicine , the report alleged			1
" some credentials files we reviewed lacked complete documentation to show that @entity13 had primary source verified all of the physician 's state medical licenses , including seven instances involving a physician 's only active medical license , " the report says			2
primary source verification of credentials means they are verified with a specific credential 's source			0
@entity52 called for the report in the aftermath of the @entity55 , @entity56 , shooting in november 2009 , for which an @entity10 psychiatrist is charged with 13 murders			1
@entity52 and the military have examined how maj. @entity61 was trained , evaluated and promoted as a military physician			1
nine military officials , including doctors , were disciplined for their actions or failures in the @entity61 case			2
he faces a court - martial , with a possible death penalty , in march			0
the @entity72 report cast a wider net and urged the @entity74 to speed up its efforts to revise and standardize reviews of doctors ' credentials			1
and it singles out the @entity10 for problems at its facilities			0
" based on our review of 150 credentials files at the five @entity13 we selected for our review , we found that none of the five @entity13 fully complied with certain @entity10 physician credentialing and privileging requirements , " the @entity72 report said			1
" specifically , we found that the selected @entity13 did not fully comply with the @entity10 's requirement to primary source verify all state medical licenses at the time of privileging and at renewal			0
" in a response included in the report , assistant secretary of defense for health affairs dr. @entity95 wrote the department is progressing with standardization and centralization of credential files and improving how doctors can apply for and renew privileges to practice at military hospitals			1
but the military warned that its centralized system would be delayed " without adequate funding			1
" the report cited over-reliance of so - called peer reviews , especially in cases where coworkers might have only a limited familiarity with a doctor			2
" in one file we reviewed , both peer recommendations were from individuals who indicated they had limited knowledge of the physician 's clinical competence , " the report says			0
" the department chief later told us that this physician was terminated within the first three months due to issues with the physician 's competence and professionalism			0
" in another instance , a doctor had problems with errors in prescriptions , above what the hospital allowed			0
however , this was not reflected in the doctor 's file			0
and the physician 's department chief " was not aware of the negative prescription days but was ' not at all surprised ' because there were current concerns about this physician , " the report said .			0
