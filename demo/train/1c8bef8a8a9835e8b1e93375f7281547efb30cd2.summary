@entity0 -- a day before president @entity4 lays out his strategy to counter the @entity7 terror threat , @entity3 @entity2 sought the counsel of @entity9 , a key architect of the @entity10			1
@entity9 huddled with @entity12 , saying @entity4 was n't prepared for the terrorist threat posed by the group and urging the @entity2 to support a more muscular national defense , @entity3 @entity2 members told @entity1			1
the closed - door meeting at the @entity17 was billed as a pre-midterm election pep rally			0
@entity9 was there to boost enthusiasm among rank - and - file members , but he also told @entity3 @entity2 that the party needs to rebuild the military and focus its public message this fall on the importance of a strong national security policy			1
senior lawmakers say no vote in works on @entity4 's @entity7 plan several @entity2 who attended the meeting told @entity1 the former vice president did n't weigh in on the issue of whether the president needs any approval from @entity36 to continue or expand military action against @entity7			1
@entity39 rep. @entity38 of @entity40 , a former @entity10 , acknowledged that his party was split on the issue but said it would be " ludicrous " for @entity36 not to hold some type of vote before the midterm elections			1
he said he believes the president has the authority to conduct airstrikes against @entity7 , but argued it was lawmakers ' responsibility to go on the record on the mission or the funding for a military operation			0
@entity56 's mission : @entity58 buy - in for @entity60 effort @entity9 , as he has done in recent public appearances , railed on @entity4 's foreign policy and defended the @entity66 administration 's actions in @entity67			1
he said the @entity4 administration had failed to lock in a security agreement with the @entity67 government to keep some @entity39 presence in the country to assist with the political transition , which @entity9 asserted contributed to the instability there now			2
" doing nothing and pulling out -- he stressed several times -- was not a good national strategic policy , " rep @entity76 , @entity78 , said of @entity9 's remarks			2
defending his record , @entity4 has argued it was n't his decision to withdraw troops fully from @entity67 ; rather he said that the @entity67 people and its government did n't want a @entity39 presence there any longer			0
" the reason that we did not have a follow - on force in @entity67 was because the @entity67 were -- a majority of @entity67 did not want @entity39 troops there , and politically they could not pass the kind of laws that would be required to protect our troops in @entity67 , " @entity4 told reporters last month			0
@entity9 : @entity67 invasion was the ' absolute right thing to do ' some republicans said @entity9 warned that the military was n't ready to respond to threats posed by terrorist groups around the world because budgets have been slashed			0
but @entity9 's audience of fellow @entity2 is partly responsible for those cuts			2
a year later , @entity4 again addresses nation on @entity113 a significant chunk of the @entity3 @entity2 members serving today were elected after @entity9 was vice president			1
in the last few years , there has been a growing divide inside the party about the @entity39 role in international conflicts			0
many elected in the last two elections have focused on shrinking the size of government and are skeptical of @entity39 intervention overseas			0
rep. @entity125 , @entity126 , said the pitch to highlight national security was received positively by rank - and - file members , but he also admitted that the cost to boost the @entity39 forces would be " significant			0
" @entity133 fears could help @entity2 in midterms @entity38 told @entity1 he shared @entity9 's concerns about declining military readiness			2
he said he hoped his colleagues who have focused on slashing federal budgets , listened to @entity9 's warning about the declining resources for the military , specifically those caused by across - the - board cuts as a result of " sequestration			0
" " i hope my colleagues hear it , because you realize sequester is damaging when it 's too late , " @entity38 said			0
@entity9 told members he would outline more specifics about what action he advocates the @entity39 should take in a speech wednesday -- the same day as the president 's prime - time address to the nation from the @entity3			2
a press release about @entity9 's speech at the @entity160 is titled " 9/11 and the future of @entity39 foreign policy			1
" rep. @entity163 , @entity164 , summed up @entity9 's advice to @entity2 members about the november elections : " keep the eye on the safety and security of the country			1
