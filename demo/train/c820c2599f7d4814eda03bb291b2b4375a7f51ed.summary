-- parents should take precautions to minimize infants ' exposure to the chemical @entity6 , the @entity1 said friday in an announcement that stopped short of saying there is a definite health risk from the chemical			1
in guidelines published on its web site , the @entity1 said it has " some concern " about the safety of @entity6 , and supports efforts by industry to remove @entity6 from infant bottles and feeding cups			1
dr. @entity20 , deputy @entity1 commissioner , said the agency is trying to determine whether it has the legal authority to quickly force such products off the market if manufacturers do n't do it voluntarily			1
according to @entity20 , the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to @entity6			1
bisphenol - a is found in many products , but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula , and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys			1
a handful of states and cities including @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity45 , have passed laws in some form banning @entity6 in products meant for children			1
the new position is a partial reversal of the @entity1 's declaration in 2008 that @entity6 has no adverse effects			1
that announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry - funded research			2
since then , the agency says on its web site , " recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of @entity6 in laboratory animals			0
while @entity6 is not proven to harm children or adults , these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of @entity6			2
" the new position brings the @entity1 into line with guidance from the @entity73 , which in its own 2008 report said there is " some concern " for @entity6 's effects on the brain , behavior and prostate gland , in developing fetuses , infants and children			1
other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease , but the authors of those studies say it 's not clear the problems were actually caused by @entity6			2
at a news conference friday , @entity1 commissioner @entity91 said further research is needed " to determine if and when further action is needed			0
" the @entity95 has been allotted $ 30 million to study the health effects of @entity6			2
@entity97 said that research would likely be complete in 18 to 24 months			0
in a separate review , the @entity99 is weighing whether to list @entity6 as a chemical of concern under the federal @entity103 , which would trigger a formal process to develop possible restrictions on @entity6			2
at the news conference , @entity97 and @entity20 urged parents to keep the risk in perspective , saying the benefits of nutritious infant formula outstrip any potential danger from @entity6			0
other guidance includes : discarding scratched or worn bottles and cups , which aside from harboring germs might also release small amounts of @entity6 being careful when heating formula , as boiling or very hot liquid might cause the release of @entity6 into infant formula checking labels to ensure that only microwave - safe products are used in the microwave , and dishwasher - safe products are put in the dishwasher , to avoid leakage in taking a middle ground , the @entity1 managed to frustrate both industry and consumer safety groups			1
@entity133 , a scientist with the @entity135 's global study group on @entity6 , said the guidance would " confuse consumers , " while a scientist with the @entity137 said the move was " too little , too late			0
" @entity133 painted the @entity1 decision as a victory , saying the announcement reflects scientific consensus " that these products continue to be safe for use			0
" however , he complained that there was no scientific basis for the advice to discard older bottles and cups and insisted that studies have failed to find evidence of actual harm from @entity6			0
@entity155 , a scientist with the @entity137 , agreed the advice was confusing , but said the @entity1 should have gone further and banned the use of @entity6			1
@entity158 , a senior analyst with the @entity159 and a longtime @entity6 critic , says mothers can largely avoid bpa by using powdered formula instead of liquid			0
but she welcomed friday 's announcement			0
" this is a huge step forward			0
the @entity167 administration wanted to close the books and declare this safe , and now that 's not going to happen , " @entity158 said .			0

bisphenol - a , known as @entity6 , is found in many products including baby bottles
@entity1 stops short of saying there is a definite health risk from the chemical
industry says @entity1 goes to far ; consumer groups say @entity6 should be banned
