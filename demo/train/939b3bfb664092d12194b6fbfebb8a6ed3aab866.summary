-- the @entity2 government pleaded saturday for @entity4 authorities to release 85 - year - old @entity5 , with a spokeswoman saying officials are " deeply concerned " about him and another @entity2 being held in the isolated @entity10 nation			1
" given mr. @entity5 's advanced age and health conditions , we urge ( @entity4 ) to release mr. @entity5 so he may return home and reunite with his family , " said @entity12 spokeswoman @entity11			1
@entity19 's plea came on the day @entity4 state media released print stories and video showing what they called @entity5 's " apology			1
" @entity27 , @entity26 professor @entity25 characterized it as " highly scripted political theater			0
" so how did an elderly retired financial consultant and @entity32 veteran become the central figure in an international dispute ? why is there such animosity still tied to a conflict , the @entity32 , that ended six decades ago ? and why is this all unfolding now ? @entity25 , a former consultant to the @entity2 @entity39 , has a theory : " they are trying to get the @entity43 media to pay attention			1
" with the notable exception of its longtime ally @entity47 , @entity4 is in many ways a pariah state bogged down by what many view as decades of repressive leadership			2
at the same time , the communist nation has had difficulties getting enough energy to power their country and food for their people			0
largely shut off from the rest of the world , its leaders and state media often use saber - rattling rhetoric to unite citizens against what @entity25 described as " nasty outsiders " -- which , not coincidentally , are chiefly @entity70 and the @entity2 , just as during the @entity32			1
the discord in recent years has centered mostly on @entity4 's nuclear and missile programs , with the international community taking punitive measures such as economic sanctions to hold @entity77 in check			2
@entity4 has n't been alone			2
@entity79 , too , has long been an international target because of its nuclear program , though that landscape has changed with the recent diplomatic accord			0
that fact may not be lost on @entity77 , said @entity25 , who surmised @entity4 may be particularly eager to get the world 's focus and , ideally , concessions in the process			1
added @entity25 : " if the @entity79 thing gets settled peacefully , then guess who 's left ? " wife , son beg for his release elderly man not only @entity2 detained @entity5 is not the only @entity2 being detained in @entity4			1
in her statement , @entity11 also asked for the release of @entity97 , who was arrested in november 2012 in @entity4			2
last may , @entity97 was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after @entity4 's government found him guilty of " hostile acts " and attempts to topple the government			2
" we are thankful that the @entity105 has advocated for the release of both mr. @entity5 and my brother , @entity97 , " said @entity103 , @entity97 's sister			1
" it has been a devastating experience for my brother and my family , so we pray every day for his release			0
now we 're including mr. @entity5 in our prayers			2
we can not forget about these two men			0
for every action that the @entity2 government takes toward his release , we are thankful			2
" @entity117 has said @entity97 suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors ' care , including hypertension , diabetes and an enlarged heart			0
on monday , @entity117 said ailments her brother suffered before his detainment -- back problems and radiating leg pain -- worsened while he was forced to work long hours daily in a labor camp			0
he has lost 50 pounds since he was detained , she added			0
the @entity97 family has been in " sheer pain and agony " since his detainment , @entity117 said			0
other detained @entity2 unique case @entity5 's age , and the circumstances surrounding his detention , are unique			1
according to his family , the @entity140 , @entity141 , resident had gone on a 10 - day organized private tour of @entity4 in october			1
from phone calls and postcards he sent , the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem , son @entity144 said			0
the day before he was to leave , " one or two @entity4 authorities " met with @entity5 and his tour guide , the son added			1
they talked about @entity5 's service record , which left " my dad ... a bit bothered , " according to @entity144			2
then , just minutes before his @entity160 - bound plane was set to depart @entity77 in late october , he was taken off the aircraft by @entity4 authorities			2
@entity5 's weeks - long detention is complicated by the fact that , according to his son @entity165 , he suffers from a heart condition			2
@entity168 's ambassador to @entity4 visited @entity5 on saturday where he is being held at @entity77 's @entity169 and delivered his medication , his family said			1
" as a result of the visit , we know that @entity175 is in good health , " the family added			0
" @entity175 reports that he is being well treated and that the food is good			0
" the @entity178 went on to thank the ambassador and " express appreciation for the cooperation of the @entity4 government in allowing the visit to take place			0
" " we are asking that the @entity4 authorities take into account his health and his age and , as an act of humanitarian compassion , allow him to depart immediately for home , " the family said			2
" all of us want this ordeal to end and for the 85 - year - old head of our extended family to be with us once more			0
" reported apology : ' i have been guilty of big crimes ' until saturday , the @entity4 government had n't said why it held @entity5			1
@entity2 accused of spying issues ' apology ' the explanation came in the form of a published apology from @entity5 , as well as accompanying images of him thumbprinting his handwritten note and talking about his experiences			1
atop the first of the four pages is the word " apology , " according to video released by @entity4			0
the end of the last page is dated november 9 -- indicating @entity5 made his reported admission more than 20 days ago			0
why might @entity77 have waited 21 days , then , to make the admission public ? that 's another one of the mysteries surrounding this case			0
in the note , @entity5 talked about his having advised the @entity222 , part of the " intelligence bureau " fighting against @entity77 in the @entity32			1
he detailed how he commanded troops to collect " information " and wage various deadly attacks			0
" after i killed so many civilians and ( @entity4 ) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the @entity4 during the @entity32 , i committed indelible offensive acts against the @entity4 government and @entity4 people , " @entity5 said , according to the " apology " reported by @entity228			1
the reported message also touches on his return 60 years later to @entity4 , admitting that he " shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers			0
" " i have been guilty of big crimes against the @entity4 government and the @entity4 people again , " @entity5 adds in the " apology			1
" his statement ends : " if i go back to ( the ) @entity2 , i will tell the true features of the @entity4 and the life the @entity4 people are leading			1
" in addition to this statement , @entity228 ran a story alleging @entity5 came to @entity4 with a tourist group in october and afterward " perpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the @entity4 and slandering its socialist system			1
" this story claimed that @entity5 tried to " look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activities against the @entity4			1
" investigators determined that , as a member of the @entity2 military , he " masterminded espionage and subversive activities ... and , in this course , he was involved in the killings of service personnel of the @entity263 and innocent civilians			2
" " the investigation clearly proved @entity5 's hostile acts against the @entity4 , and they were backed by evidence , " the @entity228 story added			1
" he admitted all his crimes			0
" is @entity2 man a bargaining chip ? @entity5 's fate , @entity4 's thinking unclear just five days ago , his wife , @entity277 , said she hoped he would be home for @entity279			1
" we need to have @entity175 back at the head of the table for the holidays , " @entity280 told @entity0 's @entity281			0
" and we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home			0
" one day before @entity279 , rep. @entity286 -- who himself was wounded fighting in the @entity32 -- released a letter urging @entity4 leader @entity288 " to release him immediately			1
" noting @entity5 's medical issues , the @entity290 @entity289 implored @entity288 to " have the heart to reunite him with his loved ones and those who can provide proper care			2
" @entity286 also reflected on the 1950s war , as well as the current state of affairs between the key players			0
" i believe that mr. @entity5 , like myself and others who have fought during the @entity32 six decades ago , wants to see a united @entity4 in our lifetime , " wrote the congressman			1
" while progress has been slow on the political front , i am confident it can be advanced on humanitarian grounds			0
" so will there be fresh movement in @entity5 's case ? will his reported apology pave the way for his release or will it be followed , like @entity97 , with a lengthy prison sentence ? as of saturday , nobody -- at least nobody outside of @entity4 -- seems to know			1
as @entity25 , the @entity26 professor said : " when it comes to @entity4 , nobody knows very much			0
" @entity0 's @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
