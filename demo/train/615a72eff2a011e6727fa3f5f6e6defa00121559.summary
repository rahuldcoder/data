fifty years ago this week , the @entity0 passed the @entity1 , which made it illegal to discriminate against individuals on the basis of race , national origin , religion or gender			1
we 've come a long way since then , according to a report issued last week by the @entity12			0
gone are the days when segregationists in @entity15 proudly declared they would resist " social equality " and racial " intermingling " to " the bitter end , " and when the head of the @entity20 flatly refused to enforce the act 's provisions against gender discrimination			1
in 1964 , fewer than 5 % of @entity24 approved of interracial marriage			1
today , 77 % do , according to a @entity27 poll			0
in 1970 , a majority of @entity24 still opposed efforts to end gender inequality			1
by 2010 , 97 % of @entity24 supported equal rights for women , according to the @entity33			1
the number of elected black officials in the country has soared , growing from 103 in 1964 to more than 10,000 today			0
since 1990 , there have been two @entity39 secretaries of state , and an @entity39 - @entity24 president is now in his second term			1
before passage of the @entity1 , fewer than 3 % of all lawyers and fewer than 1 % of all federal judges were female			1
today , women account for almost one - third of attorneys and three of the nine @entity50 justices			2
fifty years ago , women working full - time earned just 59 cents for every dollar their male counterparts made			1
today , women workers , as a group , earn 77 % of what men earn , as a group			2
women run 23 of the @entity62 companies , and a woman heads the most powerful financial institution in the country , the @entity64			2
despite these huge improvements , the historical legacy of racial and gender discrimination has not gone away			2
although one in 10 black households now earns more than $ 100,000 a year , the median net worth of black households is 14 times lower than that of white households			0
the black unemployment rate remains twice that of whites			0
black poverty rates are almost three times as high			0
these ratios have hardly budged over the past 50 years			1
@entity80 , a writer for the @entity81 , recently called attention to a disturbing graph showing that almost one - third of african - americans born between 1985 and 2000 live in neighborhoods where 30 % of the residents are poor , compared with only 1 % of whites			0
living in areas of such concentrated poverty multiplies the barriers to getting a decent education or job			0
and after declining in the 1970s , racial segregation in schools has increased again over the past 30 years , especially in districts that were released from court - ordered desegregation plans			0
this trend underscores the need for continuing federal oversight and enforcement of equal rights laws			0
women also face ongoing barriers to reaching full equality			0
despite the high - profile positions of female executives such as @entity109 's @entity108 and @entity111 's @entity110 , working - class jobs are as gender - segregated today as they were in 1964			0
most women continue to work in traditionally female occupations , which typically pay less than traditionally male jobs requiring comparable skills			2
sixty - two percent of minimum - wage workers -- and the majority of poor @entity24 -- are female			1
in the decades since the @entity1 outlawed barefaced discrimination on the basis of race and gender , many particularly talented or fortunate women , blacks , and @entity126 have acquired a degree of wealth , power and social admiration that would have been unimaginable in 1964			1
but the majority are still handicapped by their historic disadvantages , as well as by racial and gender prejudices that controlled experiments reveal to be stubbornly persistent			0
such prejudices are especially virulent when they interact with the growing income polarization occurring in @entity24 today			2
commentators continue to blame poverty on the irresponsibility of single mothers and to impugn the sexual mores of women who want insurance coverage for birth control			2
according to an experiment published in @entity150 , white applicants in low - income communities are twice as likely to get a job offer as equally qualified blacks			0
white applicants just out of prison have as good a chance of being hired as black or @entity126 applicants with no criminal record ! the rev. @entity160 once imagined a world where " the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood			0
" had he given the speech a few years later , he would certainly have added daughters to the mix. but as author @entity172 has observed , it would be a tragedy if we arrived at that point only to discover that while the wealthiest black , @entity126 , @entity179 and white men and women are welcome at the head table , the poor of all races are relegated to eating leftovers in the kitchen			1
the recent recession has demoted many @entity24 of all races to the poverty table			1
yet blacks , latinos and women remain over-represented in that group			2
the civil rights challenge for the next 50 years will be to find ways to work simultaneously for socioeconomic justice along with racial and gender equity .			1

@entity195 : 50 years ago , the @entity0 passed @entity1 , making discrimination illegal
women , blacks , other minorities have gained since then , but still suffer from inequality , she says
poverty , lack of social *mobility* unduly *affect* blacks , she says , and women 's pay lags
@entity195 : some have done well , but poor of all races *unwelcome* at the @entity24 *prosperity* table
