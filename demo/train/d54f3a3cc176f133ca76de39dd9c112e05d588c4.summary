a conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a @entity3 nursing home to photograph @entity6 sen. @entity5 's ailing wife , who is suffering from dementia			1
" it 's the worst , " says the narrator of a new @entity5 campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the june 3 primary , not so subtly pointing the finger at his @entity15 @entity14 challenger , @entity13 , trying to stir up voter disgust			1
this race , one of the nastiest so far this election year , has gotten even deeper in the @entity3 mud than that			2
@entity5 supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took mrs. @entity30 's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide , @entity33			1
@entity5 : quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge conservative outlets that back @entity13 have been all over the fact @entity5 rents a basement apartment in @entity41 's @entity40 home , and that @entity41 has traveled extensively with @entity30 on the taxpayer 's dime			1
@entity13 's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list , while the @entity5 campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist			1
new ads in nasty @entity3 primary this @entity15 primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the @entity15 : a 36 - year @entity14 veteran being challenged by a young tea party - backed opponent who calls the senator a big - spending , out - of - touch @entity15 too entrenched in @entity40			1
now @entity13 is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph @entity30 's sick wife			1
" our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever , and the evidence has shown that			0
what we 're doing right now -- we 're talking about the issues , " @entity13 told @entity72 in an interview			0
the next @entity76 ? but what gave ammunition to @entity5 allies is that @entity13 's story about when he found out about the break - in has been inconsistent			1
when we asked for clarification , @entity13 would n't go there , replying , " look , we 're going to focus on his record			0
" three more arrested in @entity14 primary scandal if @entity13 has his way , he would be the next @entity76 , going to the @entity14 to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles , compromise be damned			1
" we do n't have six more years of the status quo , " he said			0
" i am not going to @entity40 to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals			2
i 'm going up there to fight and defend the @entity96			0
we do n't have time to waste			0
so with all due respect i would suggest they join me in this fight because they 've been silent far too long , " he told us			0
" he and i are very different with our ideology			0
he 's a guy that believes in big government			2
he believes in big spending			0
he believes in increasing taxes			0
he believes in increasing his own pay			0
i am not that guy , " @entity13 said			0
for the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from @entity114 to @entity115 -- @entity13 has been its great hope of 2014 , the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment @entity15			0
things were looking good for @entity13 earlier this year , especially after @entity5 stumbled by telling a local reporter here that " the tea party is something i do n't really know a lot about			1
" millions of dollars pouring into @entity3 against @entity30 come from a who 's who of national tea party groups nationwide : @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			2
the @entity133 , a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics , says outside groups have spent $ 7.6 million on the race , much of it for @entity13 and against @entity30			2
2014 midterms : key races fighting back against tea party challenges but like other @entity15 incumbents this year , @entity5 and his allies are fighting back hard			1
@entity144 , nephew of former @entity3 governor and @entity147 chairman @entity146 , formed a super pac called @entity3 conservatives to help @entity5			1
they have been airing aggressive ads slamming @entity13 as extreme , inconsistent and out of touch with @entity3 's needs			2
other traditional @entity15 groups like the @entity155 have also come in with ads supporting @entity5 , like they have for @entity15 incumbents in other states this year			1
still , @entity5 's four decades in @entity40 have won him loyal supporters			1
on @entity160 , @entity5 attended an event in @entity162			1
he was invited by the @entity164 mayor , @entity163 , who called him a " mentor " and " great friend			0
" @entity163 told @entity72 he intends to vote for @entity30 in the @entity15 primary since @entity3 law allows @entity164 and others not registered as @entity15 to participate			0
he said @entity5 fights hard for @entity3 's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking @entity15 on the powerful @entity172 , a big plus for the state			1
" he 's a leader ; he 's a statesman , and he 's what we need in @entity40			2
so stay as long as he wants to stay , " @entity176 said			0
@entity15 @entity177 serves with @entity13 in the @entity14 , and told @entity72 he likes @entity178 but that @entity5 is the " best person for @entity3 right now			1
" " @entity179 can be a plus			0
people can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but i do n't think that 's the case with senator @entity5			1
he 's been responsive to the needs in @entity3 for many years , " @entity177 told @entity72			2
' those days are over ' when we put those bipartisan sentiments to @entity13 he responded with an emphatic , " come on ! " " i say name one fight senator @entity5 's lead against @entity192			1
name one time he 's raised his voice in defense of conservatism			2
name one time he 's fought back the liberal agenda			2
name one piece of legislation he 's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause			2
name one thing that he 's been outwardly aggressive about			0
and they ca n't name one , " @entity13 told @entity72			0
" look , there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to @entity40			0
maybe when @entity205 was president that was the thing people did			0
" we wanted to ask @entity5 himself why he thinks he should get another six years , after serving 36 in the @entity210 and six before that in the @entity212			1
but @entity5 is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head - scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us			1
we tried to catch @entity5 after his event in @entity162 , but when an aide came out and saw us waiting , they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us @entity5 was getting into screeched away without him , while he snuck out another door and left in another car , leaving reporters in the dust			1
