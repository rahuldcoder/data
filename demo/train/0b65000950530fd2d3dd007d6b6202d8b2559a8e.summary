-- on the surface of one of @entity5 's icy moons , scientists have discovered the possible existence of a very important , life - sustaining element : liquid water			1
@entity10 scientists announced monday the identification of 101 distinct geysers erupting on @entity5 's moon @entity13			1
their analysis suggests that water , a crucial component for life beyond our planet , can reach the @entity5 moon 's surface			1
first sighted in 2005 , the geysers erupt from four " tiger stripe " fractures along the moon 's south polar terrain and spew tiny ice particles and water vapor , @entity10 said in news release			2
after seven years of collecting mission data from @entity10 's @entity34 spacecraft , scientists found the geysers to be powered by small hot spots -- the result of water vapor condensing and venting from subsurface seawater ; thus , answering questions about the geysers ' origins			2
researchers had previously thought the ice particles and water vapor came from either frictional heat or from water vapor below the surface			0
" once we had these results in hand , we knew right away heat was not causing the geysers , but vice versa , " said @entity10 adviser @entity50 , who led the @entity34 imaging team			0
" it also told us the geysers are not a near - surface phenomenon , but have much deeper roots			0
" more space content : @entity58 linked to supercreativity ? we think so @entity0 's @entity60 contributed to this report .			0

@entity10 scientists identify 101 geysers on @entity13
an analysis suggests liquid water could be on the moon 's surface
