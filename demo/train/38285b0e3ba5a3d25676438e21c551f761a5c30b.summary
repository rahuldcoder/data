-- he helped resurrect @entity3 's footballing fortunes , and he has been called up by @entity4 ahead of the @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity8 's most successful olympian @entity7 calls him the " voice of reason , " snooker champion @entity9 credits him with bringing him back from the brink of retirement , while footballer @entity12 says he saved him from mental torture			1
the list of sporting luminaries queuing up to wax lyrical about professor @entity19 paint the picture of a miracle worker , but the 61 - year - old modestly downplays his role in helping shape @entity8 sport across a myriad of disciplines			1
" it is n't that i have a magic model , " he says			0
" people think it 's a cure but it 's not that			1
i just want to bring the best out of people			0
" i ca n't take someone off the street and make them a world champion in whatever sport they wanted			1
that 's not possible , as you need skill and ability with it			1
" but @entity19 ' success in helping athletes is truly remarkable , being involved with numerous @entity48 and world champions			1
not that he ever counted such things -- it simply is n't in his psyche			0
growing up in the northern @entity4 town of @entity55 , the son of a docker was the first in his family to go to university			0
he taught maths before retraining to become a doctor , and jokes that he turned to psychiatry because " that had less on - call hours in those days			1
" but it started his fascination with the human mind , which has not diminished			0
however , it was never his overriding ambition to win medals -- he got into sport by accident rather than design , working with a cyclist in 2001 " merely to help out a friend			1
" " i just want to help people , " he explains			0
" my biggest satisfaction is getting a better quality of life , where you 've seen that suffering and been able to remove that suffering , whether that 's in sport or their personal lives			1
" his greatest and most prolonged success has come with @entity84 , where he was brought in by the forward - thinking @entity85 -- the man behind the success of @entity88 , home of @entity92 winners @entity90 and @entity93			2
despite knowing little about football , @entity19 helped guide @entity3 to the brink of a first @entity96 in 24 years -- and will again work with the club 's captain @entity97 in the @entity4 @entity5 campaign in @entity6			1
he has helped five - time world champion @entity9 to fight his very public mental demons , and came to the aid of renowned " bad boy " @entity102 after the suicide of the former @entity3 and @entity107 striker 's mentor @entity105			1
" both @entity9 and @entity12 have been amazing pupils -- both have worked really hard , " @entity19 says			1
" both started from a tough place			0
sometimes people find it hard to understand that people have gifts but they can be put in a position that they 're not quite capable of understanding the emotion that goes with it , and they say or do things they regret			0
" both were determined to change and get the best out of themselves			0
it was hard work but enjoyable			2
" so how exactly does @entity19 teach people how to control their brains ? the basis of it is " @entity128 " -- which he explains in his book as the different parts of the brain that battle for domination			1
the emotional , irrational part is the chimp , which he challenges athletes to control , while seeking to remove " gremlins " and " goblins " -- negative beliefs or behaviors that can inhibit performance			0
" i use that model to access the mind as it 's much easier for people to think of something accessible , " @entity19 says			1
" but you have to be adaptable to the individual , to understand their environment and get the best out of them			0
i often get asked for five tips to help people or something like that but it 's just not possible			2
a tip to one person wo n't help another			0
" @entity19 says athletes need to work on their mind as they would their technical skills or strength and conditioning , and he believes it requires just five or 10 minutes a day -- which he does himself to keep his inner chimp at bay			1
despite all the successes , there are inevitable blips			0
@entity19 ' @entity172 , for example , seemed to evade him in recent weeks as @entity9 was unable to retain his world title while @entity3 slipped up in final stretch of the @entity176 season			1
" the driving force is that i like to see people succeed whatever it is they try to do , whether that 's medals or whatever , " he adds			2
" i get asked if i fail but i ca n't make people win			0
what i try to do is to take away the barriers that are governing them : ' what are you trying to do , what 's stopping you ? ' " it 's not for me to tell people			2
" @entity9 is a good example			0
people said it must have been a terrible day in that final			0
obviously @entity9 was disappointed as he wanted to win the title			0
" but he was in a good place in the dressing room and was talking about someone playing out of his skin			0
he was like , ' i 'm doing what i can			0
' for 20 years , he made three world championship finals and now he 's made the last three finals consecutively			2
" @entity3 's players and management alike have paid tribute to the @entity19 effect			1
he has generally worked with individuals , but likens tackling a football team as similar to his cycling experiences			2
" both @entity85 and @entity213 are amazing managers , they know how to run teams			0
it makes my life easier as i 'm just brought in to help			2
i 'm just one of a number of people in a support team in both cases			0
" it is all a far cry from his previous job working at a high - security psychiatric hospital for 12 years , dealing with people with a wide variety of personality disorders , and being helped to track down the @entity229 murderer @entity228			1
are there any parallels between such clinical work and sport ? " in sport or the corporate world , in whatever , it 's more or less the same as you 're dealing with people and what 's going on in their head , " @entity19 says			1
" if people are ill or people have forensic personalities , you still have to adapt in the same way to , ' what 's my role in this ? ' " of course , it 's a very different remit deciding whether people need to be detained for public safety than riding a bike around a velodrome but it 's the same brain mechanics			2
it 's a little bit like running a car -- it could be they have different engines but there 's a generic feel for those engines			2
" if @entity19 can help @entity4 's footballers to win the @entity5 for the first time since 1966 , he will indeed be dubbed a " sporting savior " -- but he is wary of being seen as the only solution in such circumstances			1
" it 's not just me , there are lots of people doing this , " said @entity19 , speaking more generally about his work , rather than specifically about the @entity4 team			1
" and people should n't think mine is the only way			0
" i might not work for some people , so my advice would be to find the model that works for you			2

professor @entity19 has been hailed as a savior by a long list of sports stars
psychiatrist 's work in sport began in @entity8 cycling and now *includes* @entity3
he warns that his approach , using " @entity294 , " is no miracle cure in sport or life
@entity19 draws parallels with sport and working in a high - security unit earlier in his career
