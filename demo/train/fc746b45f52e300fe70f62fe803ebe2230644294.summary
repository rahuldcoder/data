several boats carrying as many as 150 people are believed to have capsized near the western coast of @entity5 as local residents scrambled to avoid a storm that 's approaching the area , a @entity1 agency said tuesday			1
the boats ferrying @entity10 , a long - suffering @entity12 minority , are reported to have run into trouble on monday night as they traveled from @entity15 township in @entity5 's @entity16 , said @entity17 , a spokeswoman for the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) in @entity19			1

some people are reported to have survived and made it to dry land , according to @entity17			0
hindered by heavy rain and choppy waters , rescuers have found some bodies floating near the scene of the disaster , she said			0
the boats were part of an effort to relocate people in @entity16 away from low - lying areas , according to the @entity18 , ahead the potential arrival of @entity43 , a storm that may hit parts of @entity5 and @entity46 later this week			1
despite reforms , @entity5 's ethnic violence continues a community at risk the advocacy group @entity51 has expressed concerns about the safety of tens of thousands @entity10 and other @entity54 who were driven from their homes and into camps during sectarian attacks by @entity59 in @entity16 last year			1
@entity51 estimated that half of the roughly 140,000 displaced @entity54 are now " living in flood - prone paddy fields and coastal areas that may be hit by storm surges associated with @entity43			2
" " if the government fails to evacuate those at risk , any disaster that results will not be natural , but man - made , " @entity64 , the group 's @entity65 director , said in a statement tuesday			2
the @entity18 said @entity5 authorities had begun late monday to carry out a plan to move 138,000 displaced people to higher ground ahead of the storm			1
the boats that capsized were part of that operation , @entity17 said			0
