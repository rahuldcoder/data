when the former mayor and his wife learned the protest would disrupt an event led by the mayor 's wife , they gave orders to their public safety director to send police forces to prevent the students from protesting			1
" the order to confront those people came from the police department 's command center , straight from @entity43 , code name used to identify the @entity5 mayor , " @entity17 said			1
