-- are you missing a beloved four - legged friend from the past ? or , on a far sillier note , would you like your very own @entity5 or @entity6 ? a new app aims to help you find a lookalike for your departed or dream pet by using photo - matching software to find the closest match in your area			1
@entity13 lets you upload a picture of a dog or cat , or use one from its gallery			1
it then tries to find you a pet available for adoption that is the closest possible match to the one you posted			1
the app is from startup @entity24 and uses its patented image - recognition technology			1
it scans your photo , registering details like the shape of an animal 's mouth , the distance between its eyes , its coloring and its general size and shape			2
it then performs a similar search on @entity39 , a database with photos of hundreds of thousands of animals up for adoption throughout the @entity44 , and gives you the closest overall matches , as well as the closest ones in your area			1
of course , it 's not perfect			0
if the picture you upload shows an animal at an odd angle , is blurry or otherwise differs from typical shots by animal - rescue groups , there 's no telling what it will return for you			2
( tech - news site @entity59 claims a photo of @entity61 produced a " matching " image of a hamster			2
) the app also does n't necessarily consider the breed of the animal you photograph , if that 's something that 's important to you			2
and , of course , we love our animals for reasons other than their appearance			0
photos do n't show personality			0
or , in special circumstances , megalomaniacal tendencies and palpable disdain for underlings			0
we tested the app with a photo of @entity81 , a gray - and - white @entity83 cat in @entity84 , and it returned matches of cats with similar coloring in @entity88 , @entity89 ; @entity90 , @entity91 ; @entity92 , @entity93 ; @entity94 , @entity95 , and other neighboring states			1
a few of the cats looked vaguely like @entity81 , although most did not			0
but the pool of available cats may grow larger as more pet shelters connect with the database			0
the @entity13 app , released this month , is currently available only on @entity106 's @entity105 operating system			1
and while it will no doubt be helpful to pet seekers , @entity13 is not the only product the folks at @entity24 have in mind			0
the company has been around since 2006 and its photo - recognition tool has been available as a standalone @entity105 app or a web browser extension for a while			1
now , it 's planning to expand its item - specific offerings , with jewelry and furniture apps in the works .			0

new @entity13 app lets you upload photos to find a lookalike for a dog or cat
app 's photo - recognition searches @entity39 for the closest match
it 's currently available only for @entity106 *mobile* *devices*
