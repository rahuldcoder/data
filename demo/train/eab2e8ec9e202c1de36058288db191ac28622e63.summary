-- as a wife and mother to five children , @entity1 had always led an active lifestyle			1
she ran her own successful @entity7 firm in her hometown of @entity9 , @entity10 , and loved to cook and play tennis with friends			0
but in her late 40s , that all changed			0
@entity1 's muscles began growing out of control			1
" everyone assumed that i spent a whole lot of time in the gym , " she says			0
" one doctor said how many hours a day do you spend in the gym ? " but @entity1 did n't work out at the gym , nor was she taking steroids			1
as her muscles continued to grow , they also started to harden like rocks underneath her skin , causing excruciating pain			2
long gone were the days of running and playing tennis			0
even basic activities like walking and standing soon became unbearable			1
" i could n't reach up to fold over the turtleneck on my sweater , " she says			0
" i could n't reach my ears to put on earrings			0
" in 2006 , with her family 's support , @entity1 began to search for help			1
she headed first to @entity38			0
for two years , she saw doctor after doctor and had test after test , but no one at @entity38 could figure out what was happening to her body			0
for @entity1 's husband , @entity47 , the mystery was bewildering			1
" @entity38 's about as high as it gets on the notches in the @entity50 , " he says			2
" and when @entity38 tells you they do n't know what it is and they do n't have any more ways or ideas for guessing or testing what it is , it 's a scary thing			2
" after @entity38 came up empty , @entity1 applied to the the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity61			1
but they rejected her because she did not have a diagnosis			0
with her physical capabilities slipping away , @entity1 , 53 , thought there was nowhere else to turn			1
" i felt certain that if there was n't a diagnosis , i felt that it was pretty certain that it would kill me , " she says			0
in 2008 , she got a glimmer of hope			2
she was told about a new program at the @entity71 that takes on the rarest of undiagnosed cases			1
with a referral from her endocrinologist from @entity38 , she was accepted into the @entity76			1
" there just are n't words for how excited i was , " @entity1 says , " that there was a hope ... that someone would be able to find out what was wrong			1
and i remember @entity47 saying in the process , if anybody can figure it out , i think these folks can ; i think if there 's any hope , this is it			2
" after the work at @entity76 , @entity1 had a long and nerve - wracking wait			1
finally , in may last year , she got the call she 'd hoped for -- the mystery was solved			0
in her case , abnormal proteins which normally attack the organs , were attacking her skeletal muscles			2
although the mystery was solved , @entity1 's story was far from over			1
her diagnosis gave her hope that she 'd survive			0
it also meant enduring a grueling new chapter of her life with no guarantees how that would end			0
