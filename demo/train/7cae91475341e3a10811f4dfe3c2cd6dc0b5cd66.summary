-- a worrying back problem and the damp @entity3 weather were not enough to stop @entity4 marching into a 33rd successive grand slam quarterfinal on monday			2
the 16 - time major winner kept alive his hopes of joining @entity8 on seven @entity10 successes after beating another tennis veteran @entity11 7 - 6 ( 7 - 1 ) 6 - 1 4 - 6 6 - 3 for the 850th victory of his illustrious career			1
@entity4 , who had to come from two sets down to defeat fellow 30 - year - old @entity15 on friday , needed to call for a medical timeout to receive painkillers at 4 - 3 up in the opener			2
" i was in a lot of pain			0
the treatment and the painkillers worked			0
i started to feel better as the match went on , " said the @entity23 , who will next play another 30 - year - old , @entity26 26th seed @entity27			1
" it was a shock for it to happen in the first set of a grand slam when you have to play five on grass			2
i thought i was in big trouble at 5 - 6 and he was serving for the first set			0
i apologized to @entity11 for having to go off , but it was just a freak thing			0
" the cool , wet conditions did n't help @entity4 's back , but he said he was glad that the @entity41 roof was not closed before he completed his win over the @entity43			1
" i was happy they kept it open because it is an outdoor tournament at the end of the day			0
we do n't want to play indoors all the time , " he said after extending his record against 2002 semifinalist @entity11 to 10 - 1			2
" it 's not that big of a deal coming on and off			0
to see the referee coming out and inspecting the courts , that 's the whole drama that belongs to @entity10			0
eventually , if it 's too bad and it 's really raining , this is when you shut it			0
" @entity27 had previously reached the fourth round on six occasions , including last year , but but went one step further this time as he beat @entity65 's @entity64 in a five - set match lasting more than four hours			1
if third seed @entity4 gets past @entity27 , then he will next face world no. 1 @entity67 , who beat fellow @entity69 @entity68 6 - 3 6 - 1 6 - 3 on @entity41 later monday			1
it was the friends ' first meeting on grass , but defending champion @entity67 had no problems posting his 12th successive win over the 34th - ranked @entity75 -- who might be his doubles partner at the @entity77 -- to reach his 13th consecutive major quarterfinal			1
the 25 - year - old will next face the winner of the match between @entity84 18th seed @entity82 or no. 31 @entity85 of @entity86 , who led 6 - 3 2 - 1 when play was halted earlier in the day on @entity88			1
@entity3 fourth seed @entity89 had won the first set to lead his last - 16 clash with @entity93 's @entity92 7 - 5 3 - 1 when rain halted play on @entity96 , while @entity84 's world no. 5 @entity97 lost his opening set against @entity101 as the @entity102 led 6 - 4 1 - 1 on @entity103			1
the three delayed matches will resume on tuesday , along with the two last - 16 tiers that did not even start : @entity108 seventh seed @entity106 against @entity111 's no. 9 @entity109 , and unseeded @entity102 @entity112 versus no. 27 @entity113 of @entity86 .			0
