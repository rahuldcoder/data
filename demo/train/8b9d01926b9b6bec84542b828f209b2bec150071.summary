-- when you look to buy airline tickets later this week , it might seem like prices have shot up			2
for once , that 's not actually the case			2
higher advertised fares are the result of new @entity10 rules that are going into effect under the banner " @entity14 # 2			1
" higher prices shown up front is one of the four main changes that you 'll see when the the new rules go into effect starting tuesday , so let 's talk about what will happen			1
full fare advertising on some airline websites and in ads , you 've probably seen fares displayed as a certain amount plus taxes and fees			1
that 's a pretty common thing throughout society , but the @entity10 has decided that it 's unacceptable for airline travelers			2
beginning thursday , the advertised price has to be the total price including any mandatory per passenger taxes and fees			1
let 's say that there 's a sale for $ 59 each way between @entity43 and @entity44			2
now , the airline can advertise it as $ 59 each way plus taxes and fees			1
on thursday , it will have to be shown as $ 69.80 each way			0
this applies to advertisements , but more importantly , it applies to reservation websites			0
they can no longer show just the base fare in the search results			0
this may seem a little strange since it 's not the case in other industries			0
hotels still show base rate before taxes and fees , for example			1
but this is how the @entity10 wants the airline industry to work			0
wondering what exactly is included in this new fare ? fuel surcharges must be included in the rate ( as has been the case for years anyway ) and any mandatory fees			1
of course , most of the fees people see adding up today are optional fees , like baggage charges , and those can still be broken out			1
there are , however , a slew of regulations impacting them as well			0
fees become more prominent and standardized the @entity10 has decided to regulate optional fee disclosure to make pricing clearer , but unfortunately , the new rules might end up doing the exact opposite			1
a couple of things make good sense			0
if there is a change in bag fees or baggage allowances , the airlines must prominently display a link to the change on their homepages for at least three months			1
airlines will also have to make available a complete list of rates for all optional services , from pillows to food and drinks			1
while airlines have to get into specifics for bag fees , the rest can be listed in ranges of fees , making the information somewhat less useful			1
these changes sound good , but then the @entity10 steps up disclosure where it might hit the point of overload			1
under the new rules , anytime a fare quote is given , airlines have to let passengers know that " bag fees may apply			1
" in addition , when a ticket is purchased , the airline must include in the e-ticket receipt , a complete list of all possible bag fees and allowances			1
that means detailing different rules for elite frequent fliers , different rules by class of service , etc. if you 're wondering where they 'll put it , it will undoubtedly go into the fine print at the bottom that nobody reads anyway because there are already too many disclosures down there			1
one actual victory for travelers here centers around which bag fees get charged when a traveler is booked on codesharing airlines for trips beginning or ending in the @entity151 , if you buy a ticket on , say , @entity153 , but your first flight is on its codeshare partner @entity156 , then the baggage rules on @entity156 usually apply			1
the new rule means that the policies of the marketing airline , in this case @entity153 , apply regardless of who is operating the flight			0
that sounds good , but in practice it 's going to be very difficult to implement and enforce			0
no more opt - out if you 've ever bought a ticket from an ultra low - cost airline like @entity170 or spirit , you might have found yourself frustrated by the dreaded " opt - out " procedure			0
you know how it works			0
the travel insurance or some other optional service might be automatically checked			2
if you do n't want it , you have to uncheck it before you continue or it will be charged			0
this rule makes that illegal going forward			0
all optional services will be " opt - in " only			2
no price increases after you buy this might sound silly , but fares can no longer be increased after tickets have been purchased			2
has this been a problem ? no. but it does prevent @entity170 from doing something that travelers might have liked			0
@entity170 had discussed the idea of giving travelers the choice of two fares			2
one would be higher , but would not change			0
the other would be lower , but would go up if the price of fuel went up			0
so it would simply tie a piece of the fare to the cost of fuel			0
if people wanted to take a gamble on fuel prices , they could buy the lower fares			2
that , however , is no longer an option			0
but it really is minor since the option was n't yet offered anyway			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

new rules require airlines to roll mandatory taxes and fees into advertised fares
optional fees must be more clearly listed , which @entity215 says may create *confusion*
baggage fees will be subject to more *stringent* disclosure rules
