-- having had to request and frequently justify force requirements for combat and noncombat missions , i know that terms like " mission creep " and " boots on the ground " in connection with @entity11 's intervention in @entity12 are frustratingly ill - defined and usually improperly used by those who have likely never had to plan or execute a military operation			1
as neither of these terms come from military doctrine , as a former commander i 'd like to try to clarify what i think they mean ... and what they do n't mean			2
in the most recent situation in @entity12 , a team of 300 - plus military members -- of all ranks , and likely of many specialties -- were sent to @entity28 and @entity29 to " assess " the situation facing the @entity32 ' ability to blunt @entity33			1
as part of that mission , the commanders on the ground -- gen. @entity38 at @entity39 and maj. gen. @entity40 , who was sent from his posting in @entity42 to oversee operations -- conducted further analysis of the mission			0
they then likely assigned small teams to various @entity12 and @entity49 units in the fight and the @entity51 in @entity28 and @entity29 to see just how bad things were			2
opinion : what the @entity11 can realistically do in @entity12 as part of the assessments , these teams were asked to evaluate the state of the @entity12 @entity32 and the @entity49 , and determine what they would need to put up a fight against an increasingly powerful , and horrific , enemy			1
that mission changed slightly when the president saw threats against the operation centers in the two cities , and he was made aware of an emerging humanitarian crisis in @entity69 , near the town of @entity71			0
' heroic ' mission rescues desperate @entity73 from @entity33 the new humanitarian missions -- as well as an expansion of the requirement to " conduct an assessment " -- required different skill sets , and more people : intelligence analysts to track the enemy and help coordinate air strikes ; logisticians to look at potential requirements needed to transport refugees ; operators and fire supporters ( artilleryman ) who understand battlefield maneuver and fires ; medical specialists to potentially treat refugees ; aviation specialists who might need to coordinate ground maneuver with fast - moving jets and slower - moving helicopters delivering aid ; communication specialists who can expand the satellite communication to @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity104 assets ; and reconnaissance experts who would need to contribute to a better understanding of what was happening on the ground in the crisis areas			2
were there 40,000 @entity73 -- as initially reported -- or were there 500 ? what were their conditions ? what is the ground like for the potential of large fleets of arriving air or ground transport ? what does the enemy look like near the location ? who are the @entity73 , and why does @entity33 want to kill them ? all of these questions were part of the commander 's assessment -- the military calls them @entity131 , or @entity132 ( another one of those pesky military acronyms )			2
the special operators who were pulled off @entity71 wednesday night were doing those kinds of missions			0
i ca n't predict with certainly what may happen next			0
but because i 've been a part of these kinds of missions , i 'm optimistic			0
i do know @entity11 military forces are protecting the operation centers in @entity29 and @entity28 ; we now have a better assessment of the fighting capabilities of the @entity32 and @entity49 than we had 30 days ago , and we now know a lot more about the situation on @entity71			1
why does the @entity11 intervene militarily in @entity12 but not in @entity149 ? is this " mission creep ? " i do n't think so			1
it is what we in the military call situational assessments and a troop - to - task analysis , as the mission evolves			0
are there more " boots on the ground ? " absolutely , even though many who wear the uniform flinch at this term ( most would prefer to be called military professionals rather than be referred to as part of a uniform ; this term was initially coined to help determine how long a soldier had been in theater -- " i have 450 days boots on the ground in @entity12 " -- so we would know how much time at home we needed to provide them to recover )			1
now , as a private citizen and a former soldier , i 'd prefer the various analysts discuss what the mission is , and how we are accomplishing it			0
the arbitrary use of the two confusing and ill - defined terms of " mission creep " and " boots on the ground " are not helpful in getting to the meat of the strategic issues against a determined enemy			1
join us on @entity190 / @entity189 .			0

@entity11 has sent military **advisers** into @entity12 to help in fight against @entity33
military analyst : many *wrongly* focus on the terms " mission creep " and " boots on the ground "
he says the **advisers** are *sizing* up what needs to be done and *recommending* accordingly
