" the order does not say why the request was made , but it bans the government and @entity6 from making the contents public			2

" it 's a program in which some untold number of innocent people have been put under the constant surveillance of government agents , " @entity90 , the @entity84 's deputy legal director , said			0
" it is beyond @entity97 , and it provides further evidence of the extent to which basic democratic rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies			0
" the news about the @entity6 order comes as the @entity108 administration is under fire following revelations that the @entity111 seized two months of telephone records of a number of @entity115 reporters and editors , saying the requests were part of an investigation into the leak of classified information			0
