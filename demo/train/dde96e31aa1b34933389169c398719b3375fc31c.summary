-- the new - this - year - yet - somehow - already - ubiquitous @entity2 button has been around just long enough to generate some interesting numbers relating to @entity2 users and web traffic			1
the button , which launched in april at f8 , @entity2 's developer conference , is now present on roughly 2 million sites around the web , from sports sites to news organizations and many other kinds of publishers			1
a media analytics lead on @entity2 's @entity17 team crunched some numbers and found that @entity2 likes not only generate interesting data about the " likers " ( a.k.a. @entity2 users who are also active on your website ) themselves ; this data also speaks volumes about clickthrough rates , time on - site and other engagement metrics			2
stats about people on average , a @entity2 user who " likes " your content has more than double the number of friends than does a typical @entity2 user			1
this could mean the user is more " social " or more influential ; on the other hand , it could mean the user is an attention - seeking narcissist			0
while it 's fatuous to read too much into that statistic , the number does show that the average " liker " is more active from a social - web standpoint			0
an even more interesting stat about the likers is that they click on five times more links to external sites than the typical @entity2 user			1
if clickthroughs are what you 're looking for from your social media strategy , this is good news			0
here 's a stat just for news sites : the average @entity2 user who " likes " content on a news website is 34 -- that 's about 2 decades younger than the average newspaper subscriber			1
we 've known for some time that the future of journalism and social media are , at this point , inextricably linked ; this stat provides a little hard evidence for that conclusion			0
stats about traffic most website owners are aware that @entity76 refers a ton of traffic			2
it 's meant to be a content - referral network , so link - sharing and clickthroughs are a given in many cases			0
the @entity83 " button , however , might be bringing @entity2 closer to competing with @entity76 in the area of referral traffic , though			1
since the button launched and was integrated on millions of sites , many publishers are reporting large increases in traffic specifically due to this kind of social plugin			0
@entity93 reported a 190 percent increase ; @entity96 's traffic shot up by 200 percent ; @entity97 said their site traffic was up by a shocking 500 percent ; and @entity99 said that @entity2 had become their second - largest referral source			2
@entity2 relays messages from publishers saying that these users " are more engaged and stay longer when their real identity and real friends are driving the experience through social plugins			0
" as an example , @entity109 reported that pages per user was up by 92 percent , time on - site was up by 85 percent , video - viewing increased by 86 percent more videos and overall visits went up by 36 percent			0
clearly , @entity2 is only part of social media referral traffic , but it 's becoming a larger part as the network grows and users become accustomed to interacting with third - party and external content from within the comfort of their social graph			1
