-- attorney general @entity1 announced last week that the @entity3 's civil rights investigation of @entity5 's police department found that it engaged in a " pattern or practice " of unreasonable and unnecessary use of force			1
coming on the heels of the death of 12 - year - old @entity13 , who was shot and killed by a @entity5 police officer , many have wondered if this conclusion and damning report proves anything about @entity13 's death			1
but this report does n't exactly help the public 's perception of the @entity5 police , either			1
to many , the involvement of the federal government in investigating the killings of @entity13 , @entity26 , and @entity27 are a welcome event			2
after all , federal law enforcement does not have the intimate working relationship that local state investigators likely have with the police force -- a relationship that could compromise an internal investigation			2
the federal government is designed as a limited government			2
there is supposed to be no general federal " police power " -- that is , no right of the federal government to regulate for the health , safety , or general welfare of the citizenry			2
the reality is , legislation and court decisions over the past century have gradually expanded the federal government 's control and review of local activities			0
in these cases , authority to review the practices of law enforcement agencies potentially violating federal rights comes from the @entity58			0
and the @entity3 is increasingly vigilant in enforcing these laws			0
in just the last five years , the @entity60 initiated more than 20 investigations of police departments , which it claims is more than twice as many investigations than were opened in the previous five fiscal years			0
it would seem that the modern @entity3 has made civil rights a priority			0
( the @entity5 police said in a statement they 've begun remedial measures and " much more work is needed			1
" ) the @entity5 report itself is almost chilling in its detailed narration of specific instances of excessive police force			1
but that 's not all : the reported procedures , policies , and tactics are also equally as concerning			0
among the findings : 1			0
' fool me once , shame on you			0
fool me twice ... ' would you be surprised to learn that the @entity3 previously investigated the @entity85 in 2002 and found similar deficiencies ? how about the fact that in 2004 , the @entity3 and @entity85 entered into an agreement to correct these problems , including revising its use of force policy and establishing new procedures for -- you guessed it -- reviewing officer - involved shootings			1
however , that prior agreement was not enforced by a court and had no independent monitor			0
here 's where the @entity3 appears to engage in some subtle @entity101 , when it writes that in 2005 , " we found that @entity5 had abided by that agreement and it was terminated			1
" in the next sentence , the @entity3 adds : " it is clear , however , that despite these measures , many of the policy and practice reforms ( from the ) 2004 memorandum agreement were either not fully implemented or ... not maintained over time			2
" so was the @entity5 force compliant in 2005 ? or did the @entity85 just @entity112 - mind - trick the @entity3 about the force , and convince @entity3 to move along ? 2			1
' beyond a reasonable doubt ' is not a two - way street apparently investigators in @entity85 's @entity116 only find violations of division policy if the evidence against the officer proves misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt			1
according to the @entity3 , this is an unreasonably high standard reserved for criminal prosecutions and inappropriate for internal police investigations			0
not surprisingly , discipline is comparatively rare at the @entity85			1
only a small fraction of officers were disciplined in connection with a use of force incident over more than a three year period			1
the @entity134 analyzed similar @entity85 force data in 2007 , finding that out of 4,427 uses of force over four years , supervisors justified the force in 100 % of those cases			1
it 's the little things ... this is a minor detail , but a potentially divisive one			0
the @entity3 observed a sign hanging in a district station identifying it as a " forward operating base , " which is a military term for an outpost in a war zone			0
people sympathetic to law enforcement might say " no big deal -- that 's part of police culture			0
" to other members of the community and to the @entity3 , this is disturbing evidence of police culture : that @entity85 is more of an occupying army than a community partner			1
what documents ? were this not such a serious matter , the @entity3 would lol at @entity85 's document retention and production			1
the @entity5 department failed to produce deadly force investigations that occurred after april of 2013			1
@entity85 failed for some time to produce certain 2012 use of less lethal force reports			1
@entity85 failed to provide dozens of additional @entity169 investigations			1
it failed to provide final dispositions for every civilian complaint , including complaints filed two years ago			0
it failed to provide taser firing histories			0
should i go on ? if document - shredding @entity176 were still around today , even they would say of @entity85 's document retention policy : " come on , guys			1
basic mistakes and failures the report found tactical errors and a failure to follow basic , generally accepted techniques for responding to an armed suspect			1
in one such case in 2011 , officers failed to control the scene , failed to designate locations from which officers could seek cover and contain the threat , failed to use a negotiator , and grouped together with little or no cover			0
look for critics to point to these findings as support for the proposition that the @entity85 's response to the @entity13 call was bungled			2
these are just a sampling of the findings by the @entity3			0
the actual report contains other procedural concerns and is worth a long read			2
@entity3 and @entity5 have now committed to developing a consent decree			2
this time , it will include an independent monitor and be court - enforceable			2
in the past several months citizens have repeatedly demanded , and expected , the intervention of federal law enforcement in these alleged cases of excessive force			2
this shows how embedded the idea of federal review is among the public			0
but the @entity219 never provided for the federal government to review local police practices -- that jurisdiction was created by @entity223 , and really not that long ago			0
if not for that legislation , the police would ultimately only be policed ... by the police .			0

@entity228 found a pattern of unnecessary use of force by @entity5 cops
@entity234 : report reveals that these concerns were *longstanding*
in 2004 , @entity228 and @entity85 agreed to correct problems , but little was *changed* , he says
@entity234 : report damages perception of @entity85 as it deals with *controversial* killing of 12 - year - old
