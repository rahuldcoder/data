" i 'm missing my leg and there are days i do n't want to get out of bed , " @entity3 said			2

" more than 300 people have taken part in @entity34 clinics , including @entity125 , 35 , who lost both legs above the knee when he was 18			1
" a lot of us have amputations or some sort of paraplegia , quadriplegia , are stuck in wheelchairs or stuck to their device , and just to be part of nature , to be free to move with the water , it 's a freeing experience , " @entity125 said			1
each year , @entity34 sponsors a group of disabled veterans and non-vets in @entity143 , a weeklong clinic that offers surfing and other sporting events			1
funding for all of @entity34 's activities comes from individual donations and local businesses			1
for @entity3 , @entity34 will always be about more than just surfing ; it 's about happiness , not just for the participants , but for him and his volunteers			1
" i always tell the volunteers , ' you 're going to get 10 times more out of this than the person you help today , because everybody feeds off each other			2
you ca n't help but be happy , ' " he said			0
" none of us get paid , but we come back month after month , year after year , because it feels good to give back and to help somebody			0
