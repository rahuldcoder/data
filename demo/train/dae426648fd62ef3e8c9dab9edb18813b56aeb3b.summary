-- from barefoot tomboy to fashion supernova , fearless pop renegade @entity1 lives to bust all the rules			1
" i love the heavy chain over this pretty dress -- it 's exactly the way i would do it , " says @entity1			1
what are some rules you 'd like to crush ? the idea of not wearing brown and black together seems so dated			1
the other day i wore a black t - shirt , black nobody jeans , a brown leopard - print belt by @entity18 , and brown @entity20 shoes , and it looked awesome			1
also the rule about not matching your makeup to your outfit			2
i do that onstage , matching red lipstick to a bright red jacket or neon - pink eye shadow to a pink jumpsuit			1
and i also love to mix prints			2
we 've had the @entity32 , the @entity33 , and now people ask for the @entity1 at salons			1
will you be switching it up again ? the first time i heard people were asking for the @entity1 , it was really flattering and maybe a little strange			1
it caught me by surprise , but now i feel it 's a very cool thing			1
i do n't feel the pressure to change it up again at all			2
i like it , as they like it			2
can you talk about your style obsessions and how your look has evolved over the years ? it has evolved without my even noticing it			2
lately i 'm obsessed with @entity53 ... @entity54 inspires me			2
she is the most iconic woman ever , in my eyes			0
she has extraordinary style and she 's fearless			1
i love designer @entity57 ; @entity58 told me about him			0
i also like @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ... but you were n't always a fashion maven ? growing up in @entity64 , you were a tomboy			1
i wore my brother 's clothes , dresses with sneakers , or no shoes at all			1
i would always get into trouble with my mom			1
she would say things to scare me like , " you 're going to get cut ! " but i could n't help it			0
i would climb trees , steal mangoes , catch birds -- silly things that were fun to us at the time			0
my cousin and i were the only girls in the group			0
we would have to stand up for ourselves because the guys did n't want us around			0
you stood out in @entity64 because of your light complexion			1
do you remember having trouble fitting in at school ? definitely			1
it made me angry ... for the first six years of school , i would go home traumatized			1
the harassment continued to my very last day of elementary school			2
i read that your mom owns a boutique and your dad works at a garment factory -- it seems you have the @entity1 fashion line already partly sewn up			1
[ @entity104 ] well i am working on that right now			0
it takes a lot of effort , and i want to be involved with every step of the process			0
what do you do for kicks in @entity113 ? i do n't go out much			0
i 'm moving into a new four - bedroom home in @entity115 that i 'm excited about			1
parts of it will be inspired by @entity118			1
i love things like canopy beds , printed fabrics and @entity123 touches			0
then i can stay at home and cook @entity126 dishes like callaloo [ stewed greens ]			2
but i do want a sports car -- as soon as i get my license			0
who knew you were so domestic			0
you 're such a rebel			0
in the video for " @entity134 , " you drive a car			0
i have my @entity64 license , just not my @entity138 one			1
how will you celebrate your 21st birthday ? do n't scare me ! i have till february			0
i feel like i have so much more to accomplish before i 'm 21			0
many showbiz types say , " do n't ever read your own press , " but you do , even the online stuff			0
what 's the kookiest thing you 've read about yourself ? the @entity149 thing -- that i brought @entity150 on stage and @entity152 was upset , which is so ridiculous			2
or the idea that i 've had breast implants -- i do n't even have much cleavage			2
it was just the dress ! so yes , i read about myself and about everybody else in the gossip pages			0
it 's comedy to me ; i laugh about it			2
the tattoo behind your ear is a @entity165 symbol -- two fish swimming head to tail in a circle -- which represents life after death			0
if possible , what would you be reincarnated as ? if i had to come back in another form , it would be as my dog , dj. he gets the best treatment , all the attention in the world , and he 's so adorable			1
plus , he goes everywhere i can take him			0
