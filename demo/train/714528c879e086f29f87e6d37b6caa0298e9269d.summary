@entity1 resident @entity0 remembers her mother as a beautiful , small and vivacious blonde			1
so she was shocked to see the body of a tall brunette woman lying in the open casket at her mother 's wake in @entity9 on december 9			1
right away , the tears and the crying stopped			0
@entity0 and her family immediately closed the casket and left the room , she said			1
" it was n't mom , " @entity0 said			2
" they sent us the wrong body			1
" her mother , @entity19 , was vacationing in @entity20 on the family 's annual @entity22 trip when @entity19 suddenly died after feeling light - headed			1
@entity19 , 82 , was pronounced dead at @entity24 on november 29 , the morning after @entity22			1
other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement , @entity0 said , her mother was in good health and very active			1
" it did n't make sense			0
she was full of life , " @entity0 said			2
" my mother was a picture of health			2
she ran circles around me			0
" @entity0 said her family was told their mother 's body had been taken to @entity40 in @entity20 , where the funeral director denied their request to see their mother and demanded a $ 7,000 wire - transfer - only fee to send the body back to the @entity48			1
" that gave me a red flag , " @entity0 told @entity49			2
" when i hear ' wire transfer , ' i get cautious			0
" eager to get their mother 's body back on @entity48 soil and not knowing of any alternative , the family wired the money and left their mother 's passport , necessary information for the death certificate , and a set of clothes for the funeral services			1
the body that arrived in a casket at the @entity9 funeral home on december 6 was not her mother , @entity0 said			1
but the body was dressed in @entity19 's clothing and was accompanied by her passport and death certificate			1
the casket also had a small , red - velvet pouch containing jewelry and items that @entity0 said did not belong to her mother			2
" there was a medical bracelet that said ' angina			0
' my mother did n't have angina , " she told @entity49			0
now , @entity0 and her family want answers , and they want their mother back , she said			1
" it pains me that she 's gone , and it 's even worse because i do n't have her and i want to hold her one more time , and i ca n't do that , " @entity0 said			2
repeated calls to @entity24 and @entity40 over the weekend were not returned			0
@entity0 said she has n't heard from the hospital or the funeral home since leaving @entity20			1
@entity0 , who is a nurse , said she contacted @entity48 sen. @entity92 , @entity93 , for help			2
@entity92 , a personal friend of @entity0 , has been in touch with the @entity48 consulate in @entity20 and is closely monitoring the situation , according to @entity92 's spokesman , @entity98			1
according to @entity0 , @entity40 in @entity20 was supposed to notify the @entity48 consulate of @entity19 's death so the office could arrange for the body to be accompanied back to @entity48			1
that never happened , @entity0 said			2
as if the situation were n't already complicated , there 's reason to believe that somehow her mother 's body was mistakenly sent to a family in @entity110 and cremated , @entity0 told @entity49			1
" if it is mom up in @entity110 , we want her back			0
we certainly do n't hold anything against this family because they 're in grief , " she said			0
" i ca n't even imagine what they 're going through			0
" @entity121 said @entity92 has expedited a dna test to determine whether the body that was sent to @entity110 is in fact @entity0 's mother			1
" it 's a nightmare , " @entity121 said			0
the government of @entity20 issued a statement on its website explaining some of what happened			2
two women , one @entity110 and one @entity48 , died on november 29 and were taken to the same funeral home , it said			0
the government honored the families ' requests to send the bodies to their respective homes , and the deceased women were flown to the @entity48 on the same airline			0
" upon collection of the deceased the next of kin of both deceased persons claimed that this was not the body of their respective relatives and have lodged a complaint with the local law enforcement authorities			0
the body that was flown to @entity110 has since been cremated , " the government website said			0
dna analyses " will be carried out in order to verify conclusively the identity of both bodies			0
as soon as there is more information available it will be made available through the representatives of the respective governments , the families of the deceased and the respective media outlets , " the government statement said			0
as @entity19 's family awaits the test results , @entity0 said she has a terrible , gut feeling the body in @entity110 is not her mother 's			1
" if it 's not her , i do n't know where that leaves us , " she said			0
@entity0 told @entity49 the @entity20 government is performing an internal investigation into what went wrong			1
she 's been in touch with the @entity178 and wants to hire an international attorney to lead her own investigation			0
" i want an outside investigation			0
i do n't trust that government			0
they 've hurt my family , " she said			0
@entity0 , a resident of @entity185 , said she 's not sure whether she will ever return to @entity20 , although she has fond memories of the island and the residents from her family vacations			1
" ( my mother ) loved @entity20			2
that 's why it brings me some kind of peace , is that she died in paradise , " @entity0 said .			1
