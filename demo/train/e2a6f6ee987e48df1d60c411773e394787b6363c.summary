" but he did indicate the @entity15 is doing " a number of things to support the @entity7 government in this manhunt and this investigation , " and suggested under typical protocol , the @entity15 would use all its available national security resources to try to track down the origin and motivation of the attackers			1
@entity65 said while " this was very definitely a very sophisticated , precise and lethal operation , " it was still unclear what motivated the attackers			0

" but we 've spoken repeatedly about the importance of upholding the freedom of expression that is enshrined in our @entity271			0
" @entity264 went on to say that the @entity131 did n't question the magazine 's right to publish the cartoons , but just " the judgment behind the decision to publish it			0
