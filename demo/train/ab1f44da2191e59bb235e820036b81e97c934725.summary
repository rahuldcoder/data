@entity0 has been called many things , but these days the best description -- according to him -- is family man			1
the 36 - year - old rapper appeared on @entity6 's daytime talk show " @entity6 " on friday to discuss his relationship with @entity9 's daughter , @entity10 , and their new addition , @entity13			1
but if @entity0 was smart , he 'd hire @entity9 as part of his pr team			1
the reality tv momager , who has extended her family 's brand from @entity19 to @entity20 with this test run of her talk show , reiterated several times that the stone - faced and difficult @entity0 portrayed in the media is not the man she 's come to know			1
( @entity0 , after all , is now living in her home			1
) " i 'm so excited that i 've gotten to know you like i have , " @entity9 said			0
" there are a lot of things that people do n't know about you that are so interesting to me that i want other people to hear			0
" @entity0 spoke about the effect of the birth on his outlook			1
" to me it 's such a blessing , and i feel like it 's going to give me the stability that i need to really create and really do @entity46 's work in the way i should , " @entity0 , wearing a " what would @entity40 do " bracelet , told @entity9			1
" someone to be accountable , someone to be responsible for			0
after i lost my mother there were times i felt like i would put my life at risk , i felt like sometimes i did n't have something to live for			0
now i have two really special people to live for , a whole family to live for			0
i want people , when they remember me and my family , their thought association to be someone who helped , someone who brought joy			0
" he did bring plenty of joy to @entity9 's show , as she beamed while displaying @entity13 's photo for the audience			1
@entity13 , who was born june 15 , has her mother 's eyes and father 's cheeks , according to @entity9			1
" the thing i think about as a dad is just protection			2
that 's my only goal , to @entity0 said his goal is " to protect my daughter			1
" " to give my daughter as many opportunities to just be a child			2
of course , a big thing that plagues us is this idea of the paparazzi chasing a 5 - year - old around and screaming at them			0
... you have enough things to deal with and to learn being a new parent and you add that on top of it , and it becomes really intense			0
" according to @entity9 , @entity0 's been into his girlfriend for a long , long time , and would even use @entity101 to draw himself into the yearly @entity102			1
( seriously -- @entity9 showed proof			2
) although he could n't quite remember the first time he met @entity10 , 32 , @entity0 did know it was love at first sight			1
" i 'm trying to remember if the first time we met was her being in the studio when she was @entity111 's assistant , and i think she brought us in , like , something to drink , " he said			2
" or it might 've been when i was doing @entity111 's video and i remember asking my manager , ' who is that girl right there ? ' ... i was in love with her before i even got to talk to her			1
" @entity10 , he said , was always someone he dreamed about being with , but more importantly , he feels that they 're " equally yoked			1
" " being in the limelight , you have to have a match , or someone that 's equally yoked , " he told @entity9			2
" it 's difficult , because there 's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous , or people who would want you to be less famous than you were , and just not accept who you are in life			2
and when i would be on the phone with her , even at my lowest moments , she 'd give me energy and remind me of who i was			0
and i needed that support at all times			0
" @entity0 knows that there are those who think he and the @entity10 family would n't have much in common			1
but he 's trying to grow both spiritually -- " i 'm a @entity143 , " he said , " that 's what 's important to me , that i grow and walk and raise my family with christian values			2
" " people feel that me and my girlfriend 's mother are of different brands in a way , " he said			0
" but it 's not about any of us being at odds , it 's about us helping each other and improving each other			0
i might be one of the only guys in the world that knows how to pick out a pair of shoes for a girl , but i have improvements that i need to make as a human being ... the way that i talk to people , being too sharp with people , or being too edgy			0
as a creative guy , sometimes it 's hard for me to small talk			2
... and that 's something that ( the @entity10 ) family and @entity10 are teaching me , helping me to be a better person			1
" given the negative press he 's had -- from that infamous mic - jacking at the 2009 @entity179 to more recent run - ins with the paparazzi -- does he have any regrets ? not exactly			0
while there are things he wishes he could change , he also believes that " everything happened for a reason , and i 've grown from it , " he said			0
" i feel that i 'm very , very , very blessed , and with that comes great responsibility			0
with the way my parents raised me and the information that they gave me and this feeling that i have that i want to help , i think anything that could be considered a mistake will help me to make better decisions in the future			0
