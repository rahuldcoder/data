-- i have suffered from debilitating panic attacks since 1986			1
they were brought on by what happened on january 10 , when i was a young reporter at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , and witnessed the electric chair execution of a convicted killer			1
i volunteered for the assignment			2
it was an important case			2
@entity12 was 17 when he committed the crime -- borderline mentally disabled , with a degenerative brain disorder			2
authorities had every reason to commute his sentence			2
former president @entity18 and @entity19 sent in pleas on his behalf -- but to no avail			2
on the morning of the 10th , @entity12 was strapped into the electric chair and the switch thrown			1
his body slammed into the back of the chair and instantly tensed up			1
for one solid minute , electricity coursed through his body			2
executioners paused for one minute , then once again threw the switch			2
for 60 more seconds his body absorbed electricity			2
a short time later , he was pronounced dead			2
a lot of reporters probably could have distanced themselves emotionally and moved on			2
but something happened to me in those few minutes			2
afterward , i was anxious , could n't sleep , and found myself reliving the execution over and over in my mind			1
i came back to work after a couple of days off			2
the assignment desk had planned to take it easy on me , but as luck would have it , there was some kind of fatal accident , and i was sent on the story			2
a large garbage truck was picking up a dumpster and accidentally made contact with power lines			2
so , my first story back was another electrocution			0
heading back to the station i had my first panic attack			1
people have told me , " i get panic - stricken , and nervous too			1
" but getting nervous is not a panic attack			1
an attack makes you feel as if your world is ending			1
your heart is racing , you begin to hyperventilate , every nerve in your body is exploding -- it seems you 're about to die , and you have an overwhelming sense of doom			1
opinion : why do we keep executing people ? my initial reaction to a panic attack was to find something to drink -- beer , wine , anything to calm down after work			1
but eventually i had to make a deal with myself : no drinking to help " take the edge off			0
" if i was going to drink , it would be when i felt good -- pounding a few back to ease anxiety would lead me down a road i did n't want to take			0
in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s panic attacks came on to one degree or another almost daily , and of course the deal with myself was violated all too often			1
i sought help , and was diagnosed with @entity92			0
i was embarrassed and humiliated , but kept it to myself			0
for years it was very difficult			0
instead of getting better , it seemed to be getting worse			0
i withdrew , and could n't be by myself without thinking the panic attacks would send me -- in my term -- " cycling out of control			1
" i remember taking a writing test at @entity0 in 1989 and having three punishing panic attacks that were so bad i almost got up and walked out of the building			1
professional support made things get better , but the attacks never completely went away			1
certain situations and environments could take me back and an attack would come on , my heart feeling as though it would burst through my chest , worried that i would just collapse on the ground gasping for breath while sweat was trickling down the side of my face			1
ok , now imagine that happening while you 're getting ready to do an on - camera interview , or tethered to a live shot , or the very worst -- sitting in the anchor chair			1
it was n't just happening to me , it was happening to me in front of millions of people			0
i have been a journalist a long time			0
along the way i have picked up what i consider a nice collection of awards and honors , and reported on everything imaginable : hurricanes , earthquakes , floods , fires , wars , elections , you name it			0
i am proud of that work , but still feel a huge sense of failure every time i let panic attacks get the best of me			1
it is hard to describe a panic attack to someone who has n't lived through it			1
as well as an overwhelming sense of dread , a physical weight is on your shoulders -- as if something terrible is going to happen			0
but my colleagues never seemed to know anything was wrong			0
if i could n't concentrate , or felt like i could n't get through a live shot i would sometimes say , " ugh , i do n't feel good			0
i did n't sleep well last night			0
" it was all very believable			0
once , i was anchoring a live environment show on @entity0 on a weekend morning			0
when i started to read the headlines , i was hyperventilating and could n't make a sound			0
people at home were seeing video of what i was supposed to be talking about			0
i reached down , took a drink of water and told the producer i was just choking for a second			0
the hour show went off without a hitch from there on			0
i have flown nearly a million miles on @entity170 alone , and on nearly every flight i worried about a panic attack , and on a few of them , suffered through the full - blown thing			1
one time a flight attendant walked down the aisle and asked me if i needed oxygen			0
the sheer ridiculousness of the whole episode made me laugh and the panic passed , like it always does			1
what i went through is nothing compared with troops returning home from war zones struggling with @entity92 , and my heart goes out to them			1
i am healthy , happy where i am in life , and have been blessed with great jobs and great friends			0
i am still reporting , anchoring and doing live shots			1
if you tune in , you wo n't see me collapse in a fit of panic			1
i am doing a lot better			0
more than once in my life , i thought there was no way to get through this			0
i vividly remember being on a warm , sunny beach in the throes of a panic attack and wondering if my life would ever be normal again -- if i would ever again simply be able to close my eyes and be at ease			1
for those going through anxiety issues , i have a message : you can get better , you can work through it			0
it may be therapy , medication , or just the realization that you are n't alone			0
i kept a journal during the worst period of my panic attacks which helps me to remember how far i 've come since my darkest hours -- when i felt as though the sun would never come up again			1
it is n't easy to write about this			0
a big part of me still considers myself a failure for having to cope with this condition			0
yet by and large , i have made peace with myself -- things are a lot better			0
i can look inside , and ask myself : " what 's the worst that will happen ? " and i 've found the worst thing that can happen is giving in to the fear			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			1

@entity234 suffers from panic attacks that began after he saw an electric chair execution
@entity234 : in an attack , your heart races , you hyperventilate , you think you 're about to die
@entity234 had to hide his attacks while he was reporting or even sitting in the anchor chair
he is doing much better today after *seeking* help and not giving in to the fear
