-- @entity1 , who died wednesday at 91 , did n't saunter , glide , bounce or skip into your living room the way other comedy tv stars did			1
he came at you like a football lineman , charging , roaring , enveloping your senses and tickling them relentlessly with sounds and expressions you either did n't expect or had never heard before			0
it 's hard to believe that someone who was so mercurial and explosive a physical presence could become so beloved and influential an icon of the " cool " medium of television in its early years			1
and yet , at the peak of his fame in the early and mid- 1950s , @entity1 's audience was broad enough to encompass both working and thinking classes			1
imagine what could happen if a great silent - film comedian had passed a crash course in borscht - belt patter with flying colors , slinging words as he executed pratfalls			0
then again , do n't imagine			0
watch any vintage black - and - white video excerpt from " @entity31 " ( 1951 - 1954 ) or " @entity30 " ( 1954 - 1957 )			0
you 'll see @entity1 in sketches where his characters speak a faux - foreign dialect that , though it 's gibberish in at least two languages , makes hilarious sense throughout			1
you 'll see his big fleshy face in tight close - up forcing tears out of his eyes as the fiscally challenged suburban husband whose wife just charged a mink coat to his account			0
watch the contortions he puts himself through as he plays a frantically reluctant featured guest on a spoof of the " @entity51 " tv show			0
the words and comedy of @entity1 you say you 're not old enough to remember that vintage tv show ? does n't matter			2
it may help to know something about the wretched excesses of 1950s pre-rock ' n ' roll pop music to recognize what 's being satirized by " the three haircuts , " a trio of pompous , pompadoured vocalists played by @entity1 and sidekicks @entity64 and @entity65			1
but if you do n't , it wo n't keep you from laughing yourself stupid at the routine			0
by the same token , you do n't need to have seen the 1953 @entity70 - winning movie " @entity76 " to appreciate the beautifully timed expression on @entity1 's face at the climax of the parody version when he realizes -- never mind			1
great comedy is evergreen , no matter what color it 's shot in			0
though the razzmatazz culture of post-war @entity82 inspired @entity1 's all - star teams of writers , it was those same writers -- including @entity64 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 -- who went on to establish and inspire @entity82 comedic standards for the remaining decades of the 20th century and into the next one			1
" @entity31 , " after all , aired live on @entity92 on saturday nights just as " @entity94 " has for almost 40 years			0
when you watch a classy contemporary sitcom , whether it 's @entity97 's " @entity96 " or @entity99 's " @entity98 , " the character - driven , sophisticated slapstick has its precedents in many of the domestic sketches and satiric skits of the @entity1 shows			2
@entity1 's roughneck persona seemed an unlikely vessel for such versatile , urbane humor			1
but along with his slam - bang agility , he displayed the instincts and timing of a classically trained musician			0
much like the leader of a jazz ensemble , @entity1 had a cultivated ear , willing to listen carefully and generously to both his writers and his fellow ensemble members @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity118 and @entity119 , who became as invaluable to the success of those classic shows as @entity1 himself			1
he was also moody and temperamental			0
to the end of his life , he regaled interviewers with the story of how , one night in @entity127 , he became so enraged at @entity86 that he dangled him from an 18th - story window			2
@entity86 , apparently , did n't resent him for it , and cast @entity1 in his 1976 " @entity130 , " which showcased the great man 's genius for wordless wit			1
the years between the last " @entity30 " in 1957 and " @entity130 " were erratic and not always happy ones for @entity1			2
he subdued addictions to alcohol and pills , but never caught another wave like the one he rode in the @entity139 years			0
still , he lived long enough to savor the resounding impact he and his work would have on several generations of comics , most of whom , talented as they were , could n't explode the way @entity1 could			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			2

@entity150 : @entity1 was explosive , hilarious comic , very popular in tv 's early days
he says in the ' 50s , @entity1 's tv shows appealed to both working and thinking classes
his writers included @entity64 , @entity86 , @entity88 , @entity87 ; he was *hugely* influential
@entity160 : he was *impulsive* , conquered addictions , lived long to see impact of his work
