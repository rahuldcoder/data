-- last month , when @entity2 was planning a vacation to @entity4 , he set out to find the first thing that a traveler would need in a foreign land : a map			0
but digital maps of @entity10 and @entity11 for his @entity13 gps device cost almost $ 100			1
so instead , @entity2 turned to @entity14 , a community - driven maps database			2
a user - edited map of cycling routes in @entity18 , @entity19 , available on @entity21 's site			1
" it worked out pretty well , " the @entity23 - based engineer says			0
" i found @entity25 , which had outdoor hiking and cycling maps with not just roads information , but also trails , short cuts and little known routes			1
" @entity2 is among roughly half a million users who are eschewing proprietary maps information from @entity35 companies and instead going with crowdsourced versions , which they then load onto their gps devices and smartphones			1
the key to these map hacks is @entity21			1
founded in 2004 , @entity21 is to maps what @entity42 is to encyclopedias			1
the site offers maps that can be edited , customized and loaded on to devices for free			1
want to go whitewater rafting but need to know where the rapids are ? there 's a map for that			1
or to know all the interesting points along the river @entity55 ? there 's a map for that			0
and it 's all based on the @entity21 data			1
" the value is that it is a richer map with more up - to - date information because anyone can fix things , " says @entity61 , one of the founders of @entity21			1
" users get access to the underlying data and not just a picture of the maps			1
" consumer map data is currently a duopoly split between two mapping providers : @entity76 's @entity75 and @entity78 's @entity77			0
the two provide the mapping data that powers almost all commercial map applications and devices			1
but maps from these providers are extremely restrictive in how they can be used			0
want a map of the best hiking trails in the country or a walking tour of @entity10 ? traditional gps services ca n't offer that			1
for adventurous geeks that calls for a @entity96 fix			0
" @entity21 maps are a little new on the scene , " says @entity97 , who runs the @entity99 website and is the author of the book @entity101			1
" most people in the @entity106 were not using them until recently , but now there are @entity110 apps based on it			1
" getting @entity21 is easier on some devices than others			1
in @entity13 systems , it 's as simple as taking one of the available maps and dropping it into a folder on the device			0
" it 's really hard to mess up your gps doing this , " says @entity97			0
" and if you have questions you can always ask the community to help you out			0
" @entity97 says he loaded maps of @entity127 on his @entity13 unit in about 30 minutes			2
" it 's not as clean of a map as one you can get from the @entity13 store but they are pretty wonderful and have very good coverage			0
" for @entity78 systems , getting @entity21 can be a more difficult process			2
@entity78 uses a proprietary mapping format , says @entity137			0
that means a tricky process of converting @entity21 into a @entity78 - compatible format			2
@entity21 has also been used to create @entity110 apps such as @entity142 , which is targeted at hikers , skiers and bikers ; @entity146 , a cyclometer that shows burned calories , trip distance and trails ; and @entity151 , which shows all @entity153 locations in @entity154			1
the @entity21 project is a cartographer 's dream come true , says @entity158 , who has a @entity160 consulting business			2
@entity158 has created custom maps for a few clients using @entity21 and has put @entity21 - generated maps on his @entity13 unit			1
" with the professional mapping software , i have to purchase a license to use their version , which is expensive and i ca n't use the data for analysis , " says @entity158			0
" with @entity21 , i download it , make cartographic edits and hopefully i have made it better for the next user			2
" meanwhile , traditional navigation companies are also reaching out to users for help on data			0
for instance , @entity76 kicked off a pilot project at the @entity181 to collect traffic information through gps - enabled cellphones			0
users could download the software for free and use it to check on road conditions on their phones			0
at the same time , the software would report data about its users ' positions to a central database , enabling the researchers to assemble traffic data in real time			0
@entity196 has also said it will add nationwide real - time traffic data to its maps by collecting anonymous location data from @entity201 users			2
still , community - created maps and navigation information remains a small niche , appealing only to " gps techies " who are willing to take risks , says @entity97			2
" there 's not a lot of public awareness because many people do n't even know they can do this with their @entity13 or cellphone , " he says			0
but if you are planning to go to @entity216 later this year , take a look at the @entity21 site			2
@entity219 is expected to become the first country in the site 's database to be fully mapped by contributors			0

about half a million users are embracing crowdsourced versions of digital maps
@entity21 offers maps that can be customized and loaded to gps devices
crowdsourced maps can show hiking trails , whitewater rapids and other features
*developers* are creating @entity110 applications based on these maps
