-- @entity2 anti-terrorism officials are pushing to get more air marshals on @entity2 jetliners and beef up efforts to screen visa applicants overseas after some stinging criticism from president @entity8			1
@entity10 notices issued tuesday and wednesday by the @entity11 ask employees to step up to train as air marshals and to serve at @entity2 diplomatic posts abroad			1
both moves follow @entity8 's call for immediate reforms to prevent the kind of " potentially disastrous " failure involved in the unsuccessful attempt to bomb a @entity2 jetliner on christmas day			2
in particular , agents from the @entity24 division are being sought out for air marshal posts , since they already receive some of the necessary training in their regular jobs			1

nor was an air marshal aboard @entity32 on its @entity34 flight from @entity35 , @entity36 , to @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity11 employees are being asked to volunteer for assignments at @entity2 diplomatic missions to help @entity43 officials review applications for visas			1
the assignments , " some of which are located in high - threat areas , " would last at least 30 days , the notice states			0
@entity24 agents already are posted in a dozen countries to weed out applications from potential terrorists or criminals , but the new notice seeks people to conduct in - depth background checks and write intelligence reports			2

after meeting with his homeland security and counterterrorism team tuesday , @entity8 told reporters that the government " has to do better " to stop attacks like the december 25 attempt to blow up @entity32			0

an unclassified version of the administration 's preliminary report on the plot will be released thursday , @entity76 spokesman @entity75 said			0
