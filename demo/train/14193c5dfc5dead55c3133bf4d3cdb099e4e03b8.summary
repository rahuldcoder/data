@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 that crashed on landing last week in @entity0 , killing all aboard , including @entity1 's interior minister , may have been felled by the turbulence from a large passenger jet it was following too closely , the nation 's transportation secretary said friday , citing results of a preliminary investigation			1
the scene of the plane crash in @entity0 was one of panic and confusion , witnesses said			2
radar tapes show that the @entity21 45 -- carrying three crew members and six passengers from @entity24 -- was flying just 4.15 nautical miles behind a @entity25 767 - 300 at 6:45 p.m. november 4 , @entity19 said			1
the @entity26 calls for a separation of at least 6 nautical miles between a heavy jet like the @entity25 and a medium - weight jet like the @entity21 to ensure that turbulence does not affect the smaller plane 's control , @entity19 said			1
the flight controller in @entity0 recognized that the separation was insufficient and , at 6:44 p.m. , told the @entity5 to reduce its speed , but " the @entity5 did n't begin to decelerate significantly until a minute and 12 seconds later , " @entity19 said			0
" the transcript of the [ cockpit voice recorder ] reveals that , in this period , the plane entered a turbulence that surprised the crew members , and the pilot attributed it to the wake of the plane ahead , " @entity19 said			2
the pilot asked the co-pilot , who had more experience , to take over , but he was unable to regain control , @entity19 said			1
" we know that the crew recognized the presence of the turbulence provoked by the wake of the plane that preceded it and , immediately after recognizing it , the plane gave a sharp turn and initiated its descent at a pronounced angle that culminated in its impact on the ground , " he said			2
the @entity25 , which weighs 175 tons , is classified as a heavy plane			1
the 8 - year - old @entity21 , which weighed 9.5 tons , was classified as a medium - weight plane , though it was on the light end of that scale , @entity19 said			0
" therefore , it is more vulnerable than most medium - sized planes to the phenomenon of turbulence , " he said			0
officials said last week that the left engine fell off the plane before it crashed			0
lab tests found no traces of alcohol or drugs in either pilot and no evidence of sabotage or explosives , he said			1
scrutiny of the wreckage has found no indication that anything was wrong with the plane or its engines , he said			0
but the investigation did find " presumed deficiencies " in the pilot 's certification to operate a @entity5 , @entity19 said			0
audio from the cockpit voice recorder " shows the lack of familiarity " of the pilot , capt. @entity92 , with the instruments in the cabin , he added			0
among the plane 's passengers was interior secretary @entity100 , the nation 's second most - powerful official and a confidant of president @entity103 's			1
the plane crashed in @entity0 traffic and erupted in flames , killing five people on the ground and injuring 14 in addition to killing the nine people aboard			2
@entity19 said the final report , which will take several months to complete , will include studies carried out in a @entity114 simulator to confirm whether the wake was responsible .			0
