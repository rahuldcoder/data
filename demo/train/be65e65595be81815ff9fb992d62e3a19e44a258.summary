-- hewing to @entity4 administration desires , @entity2 chairman @entity1 forcefully repeated thursday what he had already said in as many words -- his committee wo n't seek new sanctions on @entity9 for the time being , and no one else should either			1
administration officials have publicly tried to talk lawmakers down from acting on legislation that would impose even delayed sanctions on @entity9 during the first phase of a november agreement to curb the @entity20 nation 's nuclear program in exchange for relaxed sanctions			1
@entity1 , @entity23 , said thursday he supports strong sanctions against @entity9 and has legislation adding new sanctions ready to move should @entity9 fail to meet its obligations under the deal , which is meant to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon			1
" in the meantime , we should not do anything counterproductive that might shatter @entity37 unity on this issue -- we should make sure that if the talks fail , it was @entity9 that caused their failure , " @entity1 said in remarks prepared for a @entity2 hearing on the issue thursday			0
despite @entity1 's insistence , other lawmakers have n't given up on the idea of sanctions			0
a bipartisan group of senators is close to an agreement on tougher sanctions , @entity0 reported tuesday , but it is not clear whether the @entity52 majority would bring such a deal up for a vote			0
that deal , if it comes together , would include a new round of sanctions to begin in six months and would bar the enrichment of uranium			0
it would permit commercial nuclear power as long as the international community monitored it			0
the bipartisan group includes democrats @entity66 of @entity67 and @entity68 of @entity69 and republicans @entity70 of @entity72 and @entity73 of @entity74 -- all strong supporters of @entity76 , whose government has panned the deal as a historic mistake			1
" we see today that that the @entity9 are launching a rocket next week , and though this was supposedly made as their space program , it 's well known that this is just a cover for military ballistic weapons program , " @entity68 said at thursday 's hearing			1
" i think that a provocative action in the midst of such negotiations should be interpreted as a sign of bad faith , and only reaffirms in our mind why we need to proceed with some efforts here			0
" but @entity94 , undersecretary of state for political affairs , testified at thursday 's hearing that while there 's good reason to be skeptical of @entity9 , it 's important to hold fast with other nations who helped negotiate the deal			1
" now that we have this first step agreed to , and are about to begin negotiations on the comprehensive agreement that we all want , if we indeed say , ' well , we did n't really mean it , we 're going to now impose additional sanctions that you all will have to live with around the world , ' our partners are likely to say , ' well , wait a minute here , you 're changing the rules ; we agreed to harm our own economies in service to diplomacy , and you 're not giving diplomacy a chance			0
' " ' lack of faith ' @entity118 's comments echoed those of her boss , secretary of state @entity120 , who told lawmakers tuesday that @entity125 legislation imposing sanctions could give the administration 's international partners in the @entity9 nuclear deal -- @entity132 , @entity131 , the @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 -- the wrong idea , even if the bill includes a six - month waiting period to see if the interim agreement succeeds			1
" even if the sanctions are not imposed , it implies a lack of faith in the process and an unwillingness to play by the rules that our partners are playing by , " @entity120 said			2
" you can design them , we can sit here and be ready to go			0
we 're just saying to you please give us the opportunity to negotiate along the contours of what we have agreed upon			0
" in his statement thursday , @entity1 agreed to do just that , and suggested that other lawmakers should follow suit			0
" ultimately , while some of us might differ on tactics , it is clear we all share the same goal : to ensure that @entity9 does not achieve a nuclear weapon , and to do that diplomatically if possible , while recognizing that other alternatives remain on the table , " he said			2
" now that @entity9 has come to the table and entered into this first step agreement , i believe this may well be the last best chance to resolve this crisis by diplomacy , and so the president is absolutely right to fully test @entity9 's leaders , " @entity1 said			2
@entity9 foreign minister @entity173 said monday the deal is off if new sanctions are imposed			1
about the deal among other things , the deal requires @entity9 to limit how much it enriches uranium , a step that boosts the concentration in raw ore of a specific kind of uranium isotope that is best suited to maintaining nuclear reactions			1
fuel for nuclear power requires 5 % enrichment , but @entity9 has stockpiles of uranium enriched to 20 %			2
that 's not enough for a nuclear weapon but still worrying to international experts who have cast doubt on @entity9 's previous assertions that its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes			1
the initial agreement limits enrichment to the 5 % level and requires @entity9 to dilute half of its stockpile of 20 % enriched uranium to at least 5 % and convert the rest to a form that ca n't be further enriched by the end of the six - month deal			2
the country is also forbidden from turning on additional machines used in enrichment , and must submit to what @entity120 has described as " unprecedented international monitoring " of its nuclear program			2
new designations issued on thursday , amid the debate about imposing new sanctions , the administration listed a dozen companies and individuals for helping @entity9 evade existing sanctions and for providing support for its nuclear program			1
they include companies and individuals involved in prohibited @entity9 crude oil transactions as well as firms and people who helped @entity9 acquire parts and technology for its nuclear program			0
the designations show the administration 's resolve to enforce sanctions during the six - month interim agreement with @entity9 , @entity232 and @entity234 @entity233 said in a statement			1
" today 's actions should be a stark reminder to businesses , banks and brokers everywhere that we will continue relentlessly to enforce our sanctions , even as we explore the possibility of a long - term , comprehensive resolution of our concerns with @entity9 's nuclear program , " he said			1
in a briefing with reporters , a senior administration official put it more succinctly			0
" we have n't let up ; we wo n't let up , " the official said			0
@entity0 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
