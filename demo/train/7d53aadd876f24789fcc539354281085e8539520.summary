president @entity0 told congressional leaders on tuesday he has the authority to carry out his planned strategy against @entity5 fighters in @entity6 and @entity7 without authorization from legislators , but he asked for their support to show the nation was united			1
@entity0 " reiterated his belief that the nation is stronger and our efforts more effective when the president and @entity16 work together to combat a national security threat " like the @entity19 jihadists who call themselves the @entity20 , a @entity22 statement said			2
" the president told the leaders that he would welcome action by the @entity16 that would aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the @entity29 is united in defeating the threat , " it added			0
earlier , two senior legislators -- one from each party -- told @entity34 's @entity33 that a congressional vote on military action against the jihadists was unlikely despite calls for one by many of their colleagues			1
while some in @entity16 want to vote on the matter , taking up such a volatile issue as military action weeks before the november elections may be politically dangerous			0
others in @entity16 argued the president already has the authority he needs to expand attacks on @entity5 under war powers granted more than a decade ago to go after @entity50			1
@entity0 has been criticized by conservatives and some democrats for what they call a timid response so far to the threat by @entity5 fighters who emerged from @entity7 to rampage through northern @entity6			1
the president authorized airstrikes on @entity5 targets in @entity6 earlier this year , but he now faces pressure to expand the campaign to go after the extremists in @entity7			2
@entity0 and his top aides call such a military step one part of a broader strategy against @entity5 that includes establishing a stable representative government in @entity6 , forming an international coalition including @entity70 countries to combat the extremists and increasing military aid to moderate opposition groups in @entity7 fighting @entity5 and the government of president @entity74			1
the top @entity75 and @entity52 from the @entity22 and @entity76 -- house speaker @entity82 of @entity83 and @entity84 leader @entity84 of @entity85 , along with senate majority leader @entity77 of @entity78 and @entity80 @entity79 of @entity81 -- got the first glimpse of @entity0 's plan to " degrade and defeat " @entity5 at a @entity22 meeting on tuesday			1
as strategy firms up , @entity29 courts partners to target @entity5 afterward , @entity82 said in a statement he would support @entity0 if the president deployed the @entity29 military to help train and advise @entity6 forces and assist with targeting @entity5 leadership			1
" i think we have to take them out , " @entity52 sen. @entity98 of @entity99 told @entity34 on tuesday , in reference to targeting @entity5 leaders			1
administration officials also planned to brief all legislators this week on the the threat from the extremists who call themselves the @entity20 , while secretary of state @entity108 left tuesday to push @entity19 leaders in @entity110 and @entity111 to join the @entity29 and its allies in combating @entity5			2
next week , @entity108 and defense secretary @entity113 will appear at congressional hearings to discuss the president 's @entity5 strategy , the @entity22 said			0
a year ago , @entity0 failed to secure congressional support for airstrikes inside @entity7 after international observers concluded @entity74 used chemical weapons on civilians			0
@entity0 launched the current air campaign against @entity5 in @entity6 , which has included more than 100 strikes against the militants , without specific approval from @entity16 beyond the president 's power to protect @entity29 interests abroad and help alleviate humanitarian situations			1
@entity0 's " core coalition " wo n't defeat @entity5 without @entity70 nation @entity22 lawyers must determine whether a plan to go after @entity5 further , which could include airstrikes on targets inside @entity7 , would require a vote in @entity16			1
polls have long showed @entity29 tired of war after lengthy engagements in @entity6 and @entity140 , though a @entity34 survey released monday indicated 76 % supported additional airstrikes against @entity5			0
more than seven in 10 said @entity0 should ask @entity16 for approval , and eight in 10 said @entity16 should grant it			0
" if this is going to be a prolonged fight against @entity5 , it seems to me that there is no way to avoid coming to the @entity16 for an authorization for the use of military force , which comes before the @entity158 , " said sen. @entity146 of @entity147 , the @entity52 chairman of that panel			2
@entity159 rep. @entity159 , however , told @entity34 on tuesday that @entity0 should act first and get the approval from @entity16 afterward			2
" this is so imminent , this is so critical , i want the president to take the action and then @entity16 should pass legislation supporting what the president does , " @entity159 said			0
" i do n't want him to wait until @entity16 acts because i do n't have full faith in @entity16 myself , to be honest with you			0
" the @entity22 said it 's continuing to seek a " buy - in " from @entity16 on any plan to defeat @entity5 , though officials say that does n't necessarily mean a vote on military action			2
meanwhile , @entity0 will address the nation wednesday night in a speech that will focus on three major themes , a senior administration official told @entity34 's @entity180			0
he will frame the threat posed by @entity5 , outline his strategy to address that threat and outline a series of new proposals on how to fight and ultimately destroy the terror group , the official said			0
opinion : to beat @entity5 threat , first understand it @entity29 may have identified masked man in @entity192 execution			0

" we have to take them out , " sen. @entity98 says of @entity5 leaders
@entity0 tells legislators he has the authority to act against @entity5
speaker @entity82 says he *'ll* back helping @entity6 forces , targeting @entity5 leaders
senior legislators say a vote by @entity16 is unlikely
