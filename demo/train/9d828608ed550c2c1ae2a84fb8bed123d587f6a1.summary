-- comedy sequels generally follow the law of diminishing returns			2
if it has a " 2 " â € ” or , classier yet , a " ii " â € ” in the title , the smart money says that it wo n't be as funny as the original			1
" anchorman 2 : the legend continues " does n't defy that axiom , but it 's still plenty hilarious in a reheated sort of way			1
@entity12 may be our greatest conjurer of clueless cinematic blowhards â € ” " @entity16 ' " @entity16 , " @entity17 's " @entity17 , and " @entity18 ' " un-killable , fez - wearing hitman @entity19 all come to mind			2
but i 'd argue that his blow - dried teleprompter - reading newsboob , @entity22 , is the most inspired creation to pop out of his beautifully deranged brain			0
with his polyester three - piece suits , @entity28 porn ' stache , and inflated sense of self , he 's pure me decade id			0
or , as he likes to put it , '' i 'm kind of a big deal			0
'' this week 's cover : the @entity35 and worst of 2013 the first " anchorman , " released in 2004 , was a perfectly - rigged slapstick machine loaded with indelible lines ( '' milk was a bad choice ! '' )			1
it was also the rare broad big - screen comedy that did n't feel stretched too thin like so many other " snl " alumni flicks before it			1
it was a giddy send - up of the @entity45 era , turning a pompous , dim - bulb newsreader modeled after " the @entity48 's " @entity47 into a harmless source of pants - wetting anarchy			0
in the sequel , " the legend continues , " the legend , well , pretty much continues			0
it 's the early ' 80s and @entity56 and his on - and off - screen partner @entity22 ( @entity58 ) are riding high			1
that is , until he gets sacked from his job by his imperious , old - school boss ( @entity62 , the first of many great a-list cameos )			0
meanwhile , @entity65 is promoted , sending @entity56 into a lather of jealousy that busts up their relationship			0
before you know it , he 's in exile , drunkenly emceeing a dolphin act at @entity74 with his trusty mutt @entity47 in tow			0
@entity56 does n't have to wait long for a second chance , thanks to a fledgling 24 - hour news channel called @entity80 that needs talking heads to fill up its graveyard time slot			1
@entity56 does n't quite share the round - the - clock network 's bold vision of the future , but '' by the hymen of @entity87 ' , ' he 's such a narcissist he needs to be on the air			1
so he takes the gig , hitting the road in his shag - carpeted rv to reunite his old news team : @entity94 's mutton - chopped muckraker @entity22 , @entity96 's casually racist sports reporter @entity22 , and , of course , @entity100 's imbecile meteorologist @entity98			0
100 most - watched shows on broadcast tv in these early scenes , " anchorman 2 " has cheeky promise			1
the decade - specific song cues and sight gags come fast and furious ... and most of them land			0
but as things chug along and @entity56 and his posse start feuding with @entity115 's more polished news team ( '' i bet his poop smells like sandalwood '' ) , the film starts to flag and feel a little too familiar , going through the same paces and beats established by the first film -- right down to a baroque battle royale in @entity124 with a parade of rival tv news teams			1
it takes the same rumble scene from the original and cranks it up to eleven			0
@entity129 is on hand as @entity56 's new boss at @entity80 , an ambitious @entity134 female producer that the hopelessly retro - chauvinist @entity56 ca n't wrap his head around			2
meanwhile , @entity136 is given an equally socially awkward love interest ( @entity138 ) that tends to stop the film in its tracks			2
the plot of the film involves @entity56 selling his journalistic soul ( wait , did he ever have one ? ) by hyping sensationalistic stories like @entity146 - style freeway chases and @entity148 appeals to flag - waving patriotism that will snag ratings and make him a big deal again			1
but '' by the bedpan of @entity153 '' he comes to his senses before it 's too late			0
of course , the plot is pretty much beside the point in a film like this one			2
what we want are jokes that are as comforting and familiar as the laugh track on a sitcom rerun			1
" @entity166 " dutifully ( sometimes hilariously ) serves up those jokes even though we already know the punch lines			1
