-- as sen. @entity1 prepares to promote free trade during a high - profile trip to @entity4 and @entity5 , a poll out tuesday suggests the issue may be a political hurdle as the general election campaign heats up			1
sen. @entity1 's free trade stance could pose a problem in november , according to a new poll			1
according to the @entity0 / @entity15 poll , 51 percent of @entity13 view foreign trade as a threat to the economy -- the first time in a @entity0 poll that a majority of @entity13 report holding negative views on free trade			1
that compares with only 35 percent of @entity13 who felt free trade posed a threat to the economy in 2000 , and 48 percent who felt it was a threat in 2006			1
now , only four in 10 @entity13 say free trade presents an opportunity for economic growth , a sentiment that clearly makes the issue a challenge for @entity1 , especially in the crucial @entity36 states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last decade			1
" it 's possible that @entity1 's decision to highlight his free trade position may wind up losing him some votes among @entity13 who feel threatened economically by competition from other countries , " @entity0 polling director @entity39 said			1
" recent polls in states like @entity48 and @entity49 have shown @entity1 well behind @entity50			2
calling attention to his stand on an issue like trade may be a part of the problems he apparently faces in those @entity59 states			2
" the poll also shows that some of the key voting blocs @entity1 is courting are most against free trade			1
women , older @entity13 and lower - income voters report feeling the biggest threat from unfettered trade			2
many of these voters were particularly receptive to sen. @entity70 in key states during the @entity73 primary as she increasingly developed an anti-trade stance			0
the survey results come as @entity1 , who is a strong supporter of the @entity76 , heads to @entity4 and @entity5 to promote the advantages off a free trade policy and economic cooperation			1
he made a similar trip to @entity81 earlier this month			0
campaigning monday through @entity48 -- one of the crucial political battleground states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs -- the presumptive @entity87 presidential nominee acknowledged many voters disagree with him on the issue			0
" i understand it 's very tough			0
but for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust , " he told reporters tuesday			2
" and the most precious commodity i have with the @entity13 people is that they trust me			0
" in another challenge for @entity1 , the new @entity0 survey indicates @entity13 continue to rank the economy as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president			1
nearly six in 10 voters say the country 's poor economic conditions will be extremely important -- ranking the economy as the no. 1 issue in this campaign out of 15 issues tested in the poll			2
that finding represents a clear change from the beginning of this year , when the war in @entity116 and the economy were tied as the top campaign issues			0
now , the economy is eight points ahead of @entity116 -- a fact that could pose a threat to @entity1 , who has admitted he is more comfortable discussing foreign policy issues than economic ones			1
rising gas prices are also among voters ' concerns , with nearly 50 percent saying the issue will play an important role in their vote for president			0
that number is just behind those that say the economy and @entity116 are important , a clear sign that higher prices for gasoline are the primary reason for voters ' economic worries , though not the only one			0
" it also means that a significant number of voters are concerned about other economic woes , like the stock market or unemployment , rather than gas prices , " @entity39 said			0
" unless there is a noticeable upturn in the country 's economy between now and november , this election is likely to be dominated by economic concerns			0
" the poll , conducted june 26 - 29 , surveyed 906 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .			0
