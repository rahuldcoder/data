-- thirty years ago , amidst much hype from @entity2 , " @entity4 " debuted in theaters			1
the movie -- with its then - unusual plot of a man interacting inside a computer as an avatar -- failed to bring in a large audience in comparison with " @entity12 " a month earlier			0
despite that , the movie left a mark			0
few would dispute that its special effects were ahead of its time			0
its early use of @entity21 inspired no less than @entity23 co-founder @entity22 , who saw it as the future of animation			0
it held a special place in the heart of not only filmmakers but legions of fans as well			2
whether they take part in " @entity4 " cosplay or own their own classic " @entity4 " arcade game , fans of the film that was cyberpunk before such a concept even existed are some of the most rabid			1
after all , for many of them , it was their first entry into the world of computers			0
this groundswell led @entity48 to relaunch the franchise with " @entity4 : legacy " in 2010 ( it even went so far as to screen test footage for fans at @entity53 in 2008 )			1
and now , the franchise has continued , with no less of a fan than @entity56 ( best known as @entity57 ) taking part in its latest incarnation			1
just like his character @entity57 , @entity56 has a pretty impressive toy collection			1
one of his favorites is a small " @entity4 " lightcycle			1
" i just love looking back " at the time of " @entity4 's " release , @entity56 said			1
the comic actor spelled out what made that movie so special			0
" we all knew ' @entity4 ' was way ahead of its time , " he said			1
" to some degree , it 's ahead of its time still			0
people know enough about the world of it and have more reference to it that it 's way more accessible now			0
" so when @entity56 was offered the chance to play the villainous @entity79 in " @entity4 : uprising , " @entity81 's animated series ( which returns with new episodes friday ) , he was glad to be on board			1
" anyone will tell you the villain roles are the more fun roles , " said @entity56 , who plays opposite @entity85 's hero @entity84			1
" i ran into people excited to see it before it happened			0
in the last six months , people stopped me all the time and said , ' oh , you 're working on ' @entity4 ! ' i 've run into a lot of ' @entity4 ' fans out there			1
" " @entity4 " fandom is something just about everyone involved in the series -- a prequel to " legacy " -- has in common			1
that was important to executive producer @entity105 , a lifelong fan himself , who wanted to avoid " typical action - adventure " casting			2
" for anyone who witnessed the onset of computers and the dawn of video games , ' @entity4 ' spoke to a lot of us with concepts about what it was like to be inside a computer or a virtual world , " he said			1
" it always sat inside of my mind			0
from a design point of view as an artist , it had such an impact on me			0
" the look of the show , reminiscent of @entity126 anime and the 1990s series " @entity128 " among other influences , was also crucial			2
" there 's an artistic background to ' @entity4 , ' from the first film with ( designers ) @entity134 and @entity135 , " @entity105 said			1
" ( yet ) some of my initial ideas were about what i did n't want it to look like			0
" i wanted it to stand out and be something that stood out from the action stuff that 's out there , in bringing a live - action property to animation			0
my initial idea was to go in the opposite direction			0
because of the world and types of stories , i wanted something that was more human but stylized , where you could really invest in the plight of these characters			0
" the series ' look also appealed to @entity56 , who famously employed all manner of animation on " @entity156 " and has worked as a voice actor for many years , perhaps most famously on " @entity158			1
" " we saw enough stuff ( ahead of time ) to know ( ' @entity4 ' ) was going to be really beautiful , " the actor said			2
" i could tell they had a really strong art direction			0
" beyond the fans , though , the show involves someone who has been there from the beginning : @entity170 once again portrays @entity4			1
a fan favorite from his time on " @entity173 , " @entity170 admitted that " @entity4 " devotees have approached him more often than those for " @entity173			1
" " this was the only one that really seemed to resonate over the years , " he said			0
so it took no convincing at all for @entity170 to return to that world			2
" i think ' @entity4 ' could very well be a mythology for our time			2
it was born at the age of the @entity185 , " he said			0
" when @entity4 and @entity186 and @entity187 destroyed the @entity188 , we liberated the internet for everyone			2
who knew ? " outside the world of animation , @entity170 hopes for more live - action " @entity4 " -- with one stipulation			1
" it 's my motivation to find a young @entity4			2
i ca n't fit in those tights			0
@entity4 's a young man 's game ! "			2

the film " @entity4 " has become a cult classic among fans
the animated " @entity4 " series stars one such fan : @entity208 " @entity56
like in the classic , @entity170 once again portrays @entity4
