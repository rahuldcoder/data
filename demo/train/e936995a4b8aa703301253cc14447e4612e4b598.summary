@entity0 -- to @entity6 artist @entity4 her shoes are weapons of mass destruction that appear in many of her works			1
her inspiration is an incident in 2008 , when @entity6 journalist @entity14 threw his shoes at former president @entity16 , five years after the @entity18 - led invasion of @entity6			1
the invasion was aimed at rooting out @entity21 's weapons of mass destruction , but @entity18 inspectors eventually conceded that he did not have any			2
@entity25 's exhibition , " @entity6 -- how , where , for whom ? " held jointly with the @entity27 duo kennardphillipps , opens in @entity0 on friday april 20			1
her shoes appear in a photograph labeled @entity33 ( @entity6 's @entity34 )			1
they are also embroidered on an @entity18 flag , on an @entity6 flag , and the originals are in a glass display case			1
" they are my shoes , " said @entity25			1
" i bought them after i arrived in @entity27 and i used them for three years			1
" she added : " shoes are our way of resistance			1
it 's all we have			2
my resistance is through art. " @entity25 , formerly a university art lecturer in @entity51 , says she left @entity6 in late 2006 after two of her colleagues were killed and she received threats from militias			1
she now lives in @entity27			1
" they started to kill a lot of academics , " she said			2
" i was a woman without a headscarf , teaching in the university and i received threats , so i had to leave			2
" two months after i left , a group of militias entered my home and stole everything			1
my sister called to say my flat had gone			2
" i do n't have anyone left there now and i think i would lose my life just like that if i went back			2
there are no words to describe it , so i use my art to explain			0
" also on inside the @entity77 : can @entity51 be beautiful again ? @entity25 said her art reflects three decades of living with war in @entity6 , from the @entity79 of the 1980s through the first @entity80 in 1991 and subsequent sanctions , to the @entity18 - led invasion of 2003 and the chaos that followed			1
much of her work uses what she describes as the " ruins technique , " using burnt fabric to depict destruction , often on abstract canvases			0
she said she experienced the war by " tasting " it , as there was no electricity or media to provide information			0
describing life in @entity51 since 1991 , @entity25 said : " @entity51 was heavily bombed in the @entity80			1
it was hell out of the world			0
i saw destruction every day and i lived with death every day			0
" there was a shortage of food , water and electricity , but you have to survive			0
many managed to survive and a lot did n't			0
three of my students were killed working in the artistic area			0
" i speak to my colleagues by phone and there are still big problems and people dying every day for lots of reasons			0
" she added : " i hated @entity21 , but we were better off than now			0
at least there was a government			0
if we want to remove a dictator , we have to do it by ourselves			0
" @entity25 's work is shown alongside that of the @entity27 duo kennardphillipps , @entity126 and @entity127 , who started collaborating in late 2002 in opposition to the proposed invasion of @entity6			1
" we were going on all the anti-war demos , but it was evident the invasion was going to happen anyway and we wanted to find another way to protest against it , " said @entity127			0
they create work from media images of the war , such as photo montages and collages from newspaper clippings			0
their most famous work , a photomontage called " @entity144 , " is a digitally altered image that shows a smiling @entity146 , the @entity27 prime minister at the time of the invasion , in front of an explosion			2
also on inside the @entity77 : artists use email scams to scoop prize another , called " @entity154 , " shows the @entity18 president 's empty podium , with the microphones pointing to a backdrop of newspaper clippings and photos which have been smashed with a hammer , creating an impression of debris and chaos			0
@entity25 hopes the exhibition will eventually be shown in @entity6			1
she said most professional artists had fled the country , leaving a dearth of new talent			0
" it 's a very bad situation for artists in @entity6 at the moment , " said @entity25			1
" they have no contact with the outside world			0
" there are a lot of good artists who have left the country and it has really affected those who are left			2
