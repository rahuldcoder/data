-- the first case of @entity2 in the @entity3 was diagnosed in @entity4			1
officials from the @entity6 took to the airwaves to assure the public that there is no risk of widespread infection			0
the reason : the @entity3 has a strong health system and trained health workers who can efficiently and effectively contain @entity2			1
this is good news for @entity3 , but what about the rest of the world ? in fact , the devastation of @entity2 highlights an urgent global crisis that , as we now see , can reach into the @entity3 : across the world , there is a shortage of 7.2 million health workers			1
the @entity3 is sending thousands of troops to @entity29 to fight @entity2			2
in @entity34 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 people suffer because @entity2 death stalks faster than local governments and international relief agencies can respond			0

but event highlights bad news in rest of world : huge shortage of health workers globally , they say
why ? health *investments* made to fight specific diseases , not health systems to *prevent* them
*writers* : governments , *nonprofits* , *foundations* must *join* to fund , build health systems
