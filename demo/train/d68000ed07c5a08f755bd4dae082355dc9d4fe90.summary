@entity0 -- @entity2 worshiped his father			1
in the nature - versus - nurture debate , psychologists say fathers play an important role in the men their sons become			2
and the two presidential candidates ' relationships with their fathers offer insight into the men they are today			1
" it 's called the cloth of individuality , " said dr. @entity15 , a clinical psychologist whose research has focused on the lasting effects of childhood in adulthood			0
rather than an either / or , she said , psychologists now recognize the cloth that results from the interweaving of a person 's dna and experience dictates both personality and character			0
in president @entity4 's and @entity2 's cases , fathers -- present or absent -- are a large part of that cloth			1
and in both cases , psychologists say their fathers ' presented different obstacles and opportunities			0
@entity4 was raised largely by his maternal grandparents and spent much of his childhood and adulthood decoding stories he heard about @entity43 's life			1
he writes in his book " @entity44 " about piecing together newspaper clippings , photographs and his family 's stories in building a portrait of his father			1
" my father became a prop in someone else 's narrative , " @entity4 wrote , " an attractive prop -- the alien figure with the heart of gold , the mysterious stranger who saves the town and wins the girl -- but a prop nonetheless			1
" but depending on a child 's support system , @entity15 does n't think an absent father is necessarily an obstacle			2
it leaves room for " imagination , wishful thinking and dreams , " she says			0
" depending on how the family talked about it will make a difference in how the person emerges from the myth of the father			0
" @entity2 , on the other hand , followed closely in his father 's footsteps			1
both were successful businessmen , then governors and finally presidential candidates ( although @entity83 ended his run before the first @entity86 primary in 1968 )			0
" my dad is @entity2 's hero , " @entity87 , @entity2 's older brother , told @entity88			1
" and , look , i think my brother 's an exceptional person			0
but @entity2 has said he 's a shadow of his father			1
" romneys share looks but not traits , colleagues say it could have been difficult for @entity2 to come out of his father 's shadow			1
" i would raise the question whether @entity2 does n't struggle a bit with meeting the high expectations that were put on him because ... you are your father 's son , " @entity15 said			2
she says studies of sons of successful men show that their children often falter because they can not live up to the aura			0
both doctors say how the candidates ' developed out of their relationships with their fathers can say a lot about the way they approach their candidacies , and in @entity4 's case , his time in office			1
" you see a path in [ @entity2 's ] maturing over the years , in what some people might call ' flip - flopping ' could be explained as a maturing path into finding his own stance , " dr. @entity125 , a clinical psychologist and author of " @entity127 : @entity128 , " explained of @entity2			1
" sometimes it takes a boy with that kind of power figure over him time to declare [ who he is ]			0
" cloud added that @entity2 lately seems to be more comfortable in his skin , perhaps a sign that he is assuming the alpha position once occupied by his father			2
@entity4 's father 's absence , on the other hand , could be credited in part for his sky 's - the - limit style that helped him win the 2008 election			1
" he did n't grow up with the father over him , which is where the boy gets the sense of limits , " @entity125 said referring to the president as a visionary			0
" he does n't govern [ the executive branch ] in thinking what they ca n't do , but rather what they can do			0
" @entity2 , @entity4 : why they have trouble connecting but for both candidates , @entity15 says , much of the credit for who the men are today rests on their own shoulders			1
" both men had to have strong character and had to have strong drive to reach what they have reached , in both cases perhaps in spite of their fathers , " she said			0
for @entity2 , @entity125 says it would be possible for a strong father figure to push his child down a lesser path			2
instead , he says warmth present in the @entity2 home could have curbed negative impacts of his powerful father			2
for @entity4 , too , it was also the sum of the people around him that may have made up for his absent father			2
" it takes a village , " @entity15 said			0
regardless of their circumstances , both doctors agree that the mixture of the two men 's personalities and the circumstances that helped them develop into adulthood were the right fit			0
" there were obviously things that went well with both of them			0
both the hero father and the absent father , the message in this is that somebody did something right , " @entity125 said .			2

@entity4 's , @entity2 's relationships with their fathers shaped the men they became
@entity4 relied on photos , clippings and family stories to learn more about his father
" my dad is @entity2 's hero , " @entity87 , @entity2 's older brother , said
for both candidates , " the message is that somebody did something right "
