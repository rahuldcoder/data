one day when she was 76 years old , @entity0 took a wrong turn out of a shopping center parking lot and found she had no idea where to turn next			0
" it was a little scary because i did n't remember where i came from , or where i was going , " she recalls			0
while @entity6 and her family were alarmed , it was only after several more years of fading memory and worsening mental condition that @entity6 was diagnosed with @entity11 's disease			1
almost since the disease was identified back in 1906 by dr. @entity11 , scientists have been looking for ways to identify it earlier			1
we do know the disease process begins in the brain 10 to 15 years before a patient 's symptoms start			1
and , by the time memory problems develop , 40 % to 50 % of a patient 's brain cells have already been affected or destroyed			2
there are certain hallmarks of @entity11 's , including the accumulation of sticky plaques in the brain , made up of proteins called beta amyloid			1
the problem is that current technology can not conclusively confirm the presence of the plaques			0
last year , the @entity33 approved a brain imaging test -- a type of pet scan -- to detect the presence of amyloid proteins in the brain			2
the @entity33 made clear , however , that the scan alone is not enough to diagnose @entity11 's			1
and , while examination of the spinal fluid or even a brain biopsy may offer a more definitive glimpse of what is happening in the brain , they require invasive procedures and it is not even clear who would be a candidate			0
in most instances , the best we have now is a clinical neurological exam after the patient has already suffered memory loss			0
more on @entity11 's disease that is why recent research caught my attention			1
studying cadavers , researchers at @entity59 in @entity60 made an interesting observation : the amount of beta amyloid protein in the brain corresponded closely to the amount of that same protein in the retina , in the very back of the eye			1
it makes sense because , as our bodies develop from embryos , the retina is ultimately formed from the same tissue that makes up the brain			2
based on that finding , the research team developed a noninvasive test to check the retina for the telltale beta amyloid plaques			1
they 're now conducting a clinical trial to see if the test can identify patients who are starting to develop @entity11 's but do n't show symptoms yet			1
@entity0 knows that in a very real sense , her disease was caught too late			2
most days , she copes with grace			0
" i do n't even worry about it			0
if i remember [ something ] , fine			0
if i do n't , que sera , sera			0
what will be , will be , " she said			0
but even though she knows she wo n't reap direct benefits , she signed up for the @entity59 trial			2
" i 'm very happy i can help somebody			0
" we do n't know yet if the test will provide to be a good predictor of @entity11 's , but officials at the @entity101 - based @entity100 say the work is promising			1
a reliable eye test " would be a very important contribution , " says @entity103 , the vice-president of @entity104 and @entity105 at the @entity100			2
" people tend to go to the opthamologist more frequently as we age			2
if you could add a quick test to see if neurogenic pathology is going on the brain , it would be really helpful			2
" this research is important , because 1 in 8 people who are 65 and older have alzheimer 's disease , and the incidence of the disease is expected to nearly triple by 2050 as the number of older @entity121 grows			1
the expected cost of care at that time is expected to be more than $ 1 trillion a year			2
the 10 warning signs of @entity11 's the trial at @entity59 is not the only one to focus on the eyes , @entity126 says			1
another company , @entity129 , has a test that looks for amyloid proteins in the lens of the eye			0
" we think it will provide greater sensitivity and specificity than looking in the retina , " says @entity134 , the company 's president and ceo			1
@entity129 presented early data at the june meeting of the @entity100 , and is currently in the midst of a clinical trial with 40 patients			1
if it proves effective , says @entity134 , the test would run approximately one - tenth the cost of the pet scan procedure			0
another test being developed tracks subtle eye flickers known as saccadic movements , says @entity126			1
" when people start to have cognitive changes , these movements become more erratic , and slower , " she explains			0
yet another approach looks for changes in blood vessel infrastructure			0
" it may not be specific to @entity11 's , " @entity126 notes , " but a big part of this research initiative is trying to find what is different between this and other neurological disorders			1
" ' @entity166 ' inspires new way to care dr. @entity168 , a neurosurgeon who is leading the @entity59 trial and who helped found a company to develop the retinal imaging test , says the problem with treatments being tested currently is that they 're being given to patients at the end stage of the disease			1
" if we can identify patients at 50 who are accumulating these plaques , and stop these plaques from accumulating , we have a much better chance of having an effective treatment , " @entity168 said			1
i want to be careful to not overstate the significance of early detection , however			0
while we doctors always love to catch things early , it is with the hope that it leads to earlier treatment			0
unfortunately , with @entity11 's , there is n't yet a treatment proven to cure or even slow down the disease			1
while it is certainly possible that a technology like this could present an opportunity to intervene earlier and to create strategies to measure the effectiveness of those interventions , the ultimate advice to patients may sound very familiar : eat right and get plenty of physical exercise , which is something we should all be doing anyway			0
i do think this raises something else to consider : the psychological perspective			0
i am not entirely sure i would want to know the fate of my brain 10 to 15 years ahead of time , unless there was something i could certainly do about it			0

researchers developed a test to check the retina for signs of @entity11 's
trial is looking at whether this test can identify patients before symptoms begin
1 in 8 people who are 65 and older have @entity11 's disease
