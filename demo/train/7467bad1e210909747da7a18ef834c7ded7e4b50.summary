-- @entity1 often gets a bad rap , derided as dirty , chaotic , and an incoherent mess of unfinished urban areas and slums			1
navigate the city 's streets and discover the many faces of @entity1			1
it 's a world away from carefully planned @entity11 cities like @entity12 -- which makes it perfectly suited for visitors who do n't need their lives hermetically sealed in air - conditioned shininess			1
@entity1 is alive with a mix of cultures , from @entity19 , @entity20 and the numerous @entity22 islands			2
sights to gawp at are thin on the ground , but the city streets have enough going on to enthrall even the most disinterested visitor			0
though it was bombed to bits during the @entity29 , @entity27 is one of the most coherent areas of the city			1
worth a morning 's visit , the old walled city 's buildings ( or rather what was left of them ) were left untouched , even when the area was given an update in the 1980s			1
but it still retains a unique atmosphere in a city where the capital 's expanding population is reflected in its growing sprawl			1
the @entity45 was one of the buildings pummeled in the war , but the rebuilt version is faithful to the original 16th - century edifice			0
@entity51 , once the guarding fortress of the city and the @entity54 , is now a war memorial			2
nearby is @entity56 , a green spot named after the national hero			0
what he would have made of the moat outside the old city 's walls being made into a golf course is anybody 's guess			1
taxis are the best way to negotiate the city , and they 're cheap and plentiful , but it 's worth jumping into the back of a crazily colorful jeepney at least once , just for the experience			2
regardless of the means , head towards the towers of @entity76 , one of the more central areas that make up @entity1			2
home to big businesses and major hotels that may make you feel like you 're in @entity12 , if you 're there on a saturday make sure you wander through @entity83			2
it 's an upmarket affair , relatively speaking , where you can grab some great local food and produce			0
those hankering for excellent western food and a glimpse of @entity1 's long - lunching business - types should head to @entity91 on @entity92			1
while you 're never far from an urban vignette that contrasts with the central business district 's gloss , it 's best to plunge into another area of the city for more local color and flavor			2
a taxi ride away is @entity103 , home to some uniquely @entity106 attractions			0
once the shoe - making capital of the capital , you 'll find @entity110 here			2
but it does n't house just any old shoes			0
no , it 's basically a celebration of the shoes of @entity116 , the country 's former first lady , who still deeply divides opinions among @entity22			1
a bit kitsch , a bit weird , with over 605 pairs of her footwear ( size eight and a half , if you must know ) and a selection of photos of the former first lady with world leaders , complete with hilariously obsequious captions , it 's a sight to behold			1
snap back to reality with a moto - taxi ride to @entity103 's market			0
the covered lanes are a hive of stalls and intriguing local life			0
heading back towards the central area of the city and @entity143 , visit @entity144			1
located just off @entity146 it was formerly @entity147 , a mix of shoe outlets for nearby factories			0
now the low - rise complex of boutiques , bars , galleries and antique shops has to be a contender for hippest spot in @entity1 , a city that does n't bother itself too much with anything so affected			1
relaxed and fun , it 's a great place to while away a few hours			0
when the shops there close you can get some great local , homemade food , down a cocktail or @entity167 lager or two , and wind down away from the chaos of the streets and plot some evening entertainment			0
later on , head to @entity76 , one of the main areas for bars of varying descriptions and clientele			0
@entity176 is one of the city 's best for music			1
attracting typically exuberant @entity106 crowds , like all good live music venues it 's got a comforting , grimy edge			0
it hosts bands playing all sorts of music , and , rare for @entity22 bands , no covers			0
to push on through to the morning light , @entity190 in @entity191 is the club with the most in - crowd hipsters queuing to get in			0
