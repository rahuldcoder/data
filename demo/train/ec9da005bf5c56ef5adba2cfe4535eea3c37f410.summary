could your cell phone be bad for your health ? maybe			1
but not because it 's zapping your brain			0
more homes are using just the cell phones , which limits the @entity8 's ability to collect health data			1
according to a report released this week by the @entity8 , as many as one - quarter of homes in certain areas , such as @entity14 and @entity15 , lack a landline and are completely reliant on cell phones			1
while that 's terrific news for reducing the cost of phone bills , it may not be so great in terms of health -- or at least health care in general			0
the @entity8 often relies solely on landline phones when conducting large , state - based health surveys , conducted every year to determine sexual habits , childhood immunizations rates , and dozens of others factors related to @entity33 health			1
" it does n't affect health per se , rather it has implications for how well the @entity8 and others can track the health of the nation , " said @entity34 , senior scientist at the @entity8 's @entity35			2
the federal government and states often use the survey information to set national health policies aimed at reducing the number of people who lack health insurance , decreasing high - risk behavior and determining immunization rates for children and teens , @entity34 said			1
the @entity8 's report is the first to compare wireless phone -- only homes on a state - by - state basis			1
the new report is based on 2007 data , which found that @entity14 had the highest percentage of cell phone -- only homes ( at 26 percent ) and @entity62 has the lowest ( 5 percent )			1
there are probably more landline - free homes now , as the rate has increased by 3 percentage points each year , said @entity34			2
@entity67 : cell phone study suggests people are losing their wanderlust " i 'd expect today in 2009 the rate is probably 5 percentage points higher , perhaps even more , " he said			1
overall , about one in six @entity33 homes or about 18 percent , rely solely on wireless phones			2
the high rates of cell phone -- only homes were not that surprising , said @entity34			1
what was surprising , he noted , was the wide variation from state to state			0
the rates of cell phone -- only homes are generally low in the @entity88 ; for example , @entity82 ( 5.6 percent ) , @entity83 ( 8.0 percent ) and @entity84 ( 5.7 percent ) have low rates			1
in other areas , it 's a different story - in @entity92 the rate is 23.2 percent , and in @entity94 it 's 22.6 percent			0
check your state 's percentage of wireless phone -- only homes			0
the wide variation is due to factors such as income and age			0
young adults living on their own in rentals , for instance , are less likely to have landlines			0
" households in poverty or near poverty are also more likely to be wireless - only , " said @entity34			0
while missing a pesky phone call from a @entity8 researcher asking probing questions about your private health information may seem like a good thing , it 's not , said @entity34			2
" as a result of missing all of these wireless - only households , those surveys can be biased , " he explained			0
" the potential for bias in @entity14 is greater than the potential for bias in @entity62			2
" some major , national @entity8 surveys are done door - to - door , but many state surveys rely on landline phones			1
the @entity8 does n't use cell phones for a number of reasons , said @entity34			2
most callers are n't happy about using cell phone minutes to chat about a survey , and participants might want compensation for taking part in the survey			1
the @entity139 forbids the use of automated or computer - generated dialing to cell phone numbers			1
researchers can do it by hand , but it costs more money			0
researchers are considering finding ways to call cell phones or going back to an older method , in which surveys are mailed to specific addresses			2
it seems unlikely that @entity33 will be adding landlines back into the mix any time soon or ever , particularly given the added expense in a weak economy			0
@entity67 : 10 ways to go from tired to terrific " all of the major surveys are already experimenting with methods of contacting the wireless only population , " said @entity34			0
" it has to be done , but it requires additional money and experimentation to determine the best way to do it			0

@entity8 relies on landline phones for health surveys , conducted every year
survey used for national health policies for health insurance , immunization and etc.
26 percent of @entity14 were cell phone - only homes ; @entity62 had 5 percent
