-- an aspiring astronaut steals a safe full of moon rocks worth millions to impress his girlfriend			1
sounds like the pitch to the latest @entity6 heist movie , and it may soon end up on the big screen , but this story really happened and now it 's become one of the summer 's most buzzed - about books			1
best - selling author @entity12 has turned the true - life caper into " @entity14 : the @entity15 in @entity16			1
" @entity12 chronicles the exploits of @entity18 , a 25 - year - old @entity19 trainee who in 2002 stole 17 pounds of moon rocks from @entity21 , got caught and went to federal prison			1
@entity18 claims he did it all in the name of love			2
this is the 12th book from @entity28 graduate who has created his own subgenre of nonfiction , chronicling the stories of young geniuses , some with questionable ethics , who challenge the establishment in a quest to make millions , even billions of dollars			0
@entity12 's " @entity39 , " about @entity41 students who won big at blackjack , was turned into the 2008 movie , " 21			1
" his previous book " @entity44 , " became the @entity46 - winning movie , " @entity47 " last year			1
now " @entity14 " is climbing the best - seller lists , getting rave reviews and is also headed for a @entity6 adaptation			2
@entity0 spoke with the author , who 's now on a national tour promoting his book			0
the following is an edited transcript of our interview : @entity0 : this sounds more like a @entity6 heist movie , but amazingly " @entity14 " is a true story			1
what led you to write it ? @entity12 : actually , @entity18 's story came to me			1
soon after he was released from prison , he reached me through mutual friends ; he 'd read my stuff in prison and wanted to tell me his story			2
ever since " @entity39 " and especially since " @entity47 " every genius kid who pulls of a scheme calls me , but this story was different -- it really blew my mind			1
i 'd always wanted to write about @entity19 , because when you think of @entity19 you think of the ' 60s , the @entity77 stuff , not the @entity19 of today			2
@entity18 's story was a great way to get inside one of the most amazing places on earth			1
' @entity82 ' unleashes terrifying events @entity0 : tell me more about @entity18 , the man at the center of your book			2
@entity12 : @entity18 is the most complex character i 've ever written about			1
he 's brilliant , charismatic , very nice , and yet he did this crazy thing that derailed his life and ruined his dreams			0
he fell in love , did something stupid for love -- but more than that , he became this @entity96 character			0
usually , the geeky guys i write about do what they do because they ca n't get laid			0
@entity18 was kind of the opposite			2
he got in trouble because he could get the girl			0
@entity0 : where is @entity18 now ? @entity12 : @entity104			1
when he got out of prison , he went back to the @entity108 to finish his ph.d. currently , i think he 's looking for somewhere else to continue that work -- he 's got a theory of physics he 's been working on , and he 's really out there			2
he 's an intense , interesting person , so i have no idea what 's next for him			0
' @entity47 ' scores big at the @entity117 @entity0 : @entity6 turned your last book , " @entity44 " into the @entity46 - winning film , " @entity47			1
" i understand similar plans are under way for " @entity14			2
" @entity12 : yes , the same producers from " @entity47 " are making " @entity14			1
" @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127			0
they are unbelievable talents and it 's amazing to have them making this			0
it 's with @entity135 / @entity134 again , they 've done such great things with my previous two movies			1
it 's going to be awesome			0
and hopefully " @entity14 " will be my first movie that keeps the title of the book ! how can you not love " @entity14 ? " @entity0 : i understand your wife helped you come up with the book title ? @entity12 : yes , she was the dirty mind behind " @entity14			1
" in the story , @entity18 actually spread some moon rocks on a bed and had sex with his girlfriend on them , so that 's where it comes from			1
but i think it 's very catchy			0
author : watch out for ' the accident people ' @entity0 : you 've written about card - counting math geniuses , @entity162 billionaires , and a failed moon - rock heist			0
they all show a darker side of the @entity167 dream , so what draws you to these stories ? @entity12 : i live vicariously through my subjects			0
i try to be @entity172 without the drugs , guns , and alcohol			0
i am fascinated by geeks turned rock stars , by smart people who do crazy things , by stories involving sex , money and betrayal			0
it 's what i like to read and watch so it 's what i like to write			0
@entity0 : what are you working on next ? @entity12 : a couple of projects , a documentary tv show where i go inside these wild stories every week , a scripted show idea or two , but i do n't have my next book yet			0
i 'm waiting for someone to call me with a crazy enough story .			0
