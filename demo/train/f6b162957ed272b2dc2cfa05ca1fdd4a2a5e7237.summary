-- grilled @entity2 anyone ? i am standing in a @entity5 kitchen on a picturesque ranch outside of @entity8 kneading dough that will become mini tortillas			1
i 've already grilled the cactus that will be a part of the topping for these mini tortillas called @entity13			1
the rest of my gang is working equally hard -- my son @entity26 and husband @entity27 volunteered for the rice , my two daughters @entity15 and @entity16 ( chocoholics ! ) for the chocolate pudding dessert made with the famous chocolate from this region and i work on the little tortillas that we will cook outside on a special tortilla grill called a @entity29			2
welcome to @entity30 run by well - known chef @entity31 , an @entity32 from @entity33 , who fell in love with @entity5 on vacation more than 20 years ago and has lived here most of the time since , raising her two kids here , offering cooking lessons and culinary tours			1
" @entity5 is so wonderful for kids , " she tells me			1
" we had spent the morning touring the ancient ruin of @entity46 , where @entity47 lived from 500 @entity48 until 1500 ad			2
the place is huge -- some 12 square miles with 21 buildings in various stages of excavation			2
the views of the surrounding mountains and valleys are stupendous			2
we climb down into an ancient tomb to the museum and marvel at the artifacts that have been found here -- skulls , pottery , jugs , beads and even tiny children 's toys			2
@entity8 is in the southeastern part of @entity5 or and we 've come here for a few days of cultural immersion after a week lazing on the beach			2
@entity5 beaches are terrific , of course , but there is so much more to see and do in this country , including learning about the cuisine			2
to make the most of our time , we 've arranged for @entity77 - @entity76 to guide us -- including our day at cooking school -- so that i do n't have to fret the details			2
while we were touring the ruin , the other people in @entity31 's class , including a family of eight whose members ranged in age from seven months to 88 years , shopped with @entity87 for the ingredients for the feast we would cook			1
" we all love to cook and be in the kitchen together , " said @entity90 of @entity91 she 'd gathered her family -- mother - in - law , children and grandson -- from around the country for a trip to @entity8 and a day here			2
as kids become more sophisticated eaters there are more opportunities to learn about cooking and local cuisine on vacation , whether visiting local restaurants or farmer 's markets			1
( i especially love @entity110 's @entity109 where kids can talk to local farmers			1
even museums are getting into the act			2
this month the @entity116 will become the first museum in the country to have an @entity119 featuring gardens , a greenhouse , teaching kitchens and even a chicken coop -- all designed as a national model to teach kids where food comes from and how to prepare it			1
kids can even learn to cook while cruising the high seas ! aboard the @entity133 , for example , there 's the kids and teens @entity136 where kids learn to create dishes on board ship as part of @entity141			1
@entity143 's med cruises offer adults - only cooking lessons at a farm in @entity147 while the kids are entertained and supervised on board			1
@entity143 also offers family shore excursions where you can all cook together			1
" family cooking classes in @entity156 are a big hit and can be the most memorable part of an itinerary , " says @entity152 of @entity153 ! , which arranges such excursions			0
" the best classes are hands - on where kids are engaged and interacting with the instructor , and then everyone sits down for a yummy meal as the grand finale			1
" resorts are incorporating cooking lessons and demonstrations in their kids programs too -- from major all - inclusives like @entity173 in the @entity174 to the @entity175 in @entity176 , offering great summer kids - free deals along with deals for single parents			1
the @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 offers a @entity185 class every saturday that is open to the entire family			1
this class focuses on the origins of " jerk , " the ingredients used in making it and how to prepare it			0
the mega-resort @entity193 in the @entity195 has even built a @entity196 for budding chefs , as part of its expansive new @entity199 , while @entity202 hotels in @entity203 and @entity204 invite kids to @entity206			1
there are plenty of options too at small hotels like @entity211 and @entity212 in @entity213 , @entity214 , or the @entity215 in @entity216 , which offers summer culinary camps for kids , as well as special private family classes			1
they 're also pet friendly			0
( for more information on cooking classes at small inns , check out www.bedandbreakfast.com			0
) @entity31 , meanwhile , herself the mom of two teens , could n't have been more welcoming to the baby in our group , even providing a port - a - crib and a young local girl more than happy to play with him while his parents and grandparents cooked			1
she explained the day 's recipes : @entity236 , basic @entity238 snacks that are small tortillas smeared with bean paste , cheese and various toppings ; grilled @entity242 ( @entity2 with avocado , tomatoes , cilantro and more to put on palm - sized tortillas ; @entity247 ; @entity249 salad with pears and @entity251 ; a savory chicken stew with capers and olives ; rice flavored with @entity256 , a pre-hispanic herb ; and the piece de resistance -- a @entity238 chocolate pudding with a strawberry tangerine sauce			0
soon the big kitchen was noisy as the 30 people chopped and stirred and kneaded and sipped @entity5 beer			0
i spent a lot of time grinding spices with an old - fashioned mortar and pestle			0
" this is right up my alley , " says 22 - year - old @entity270 , a college senior from @entity271 , who opted for cooking school with her aunt and uncle while her parents , younger sister and cousin spent the day in @entity8			0
some work harder on their dishes than others			0
some wander outside to the @entity29 ; others to the garden			0
thankfully , @entity87 's staff whisks away the dirty pans , bowls and measuring spoons			0
when everything is ready , they invite us to the big wooden tables and serve us our creations course by course			0
we applaud after each one			0
we 're proud of ourselves and eat until we ca n't manage another bite			0
@entity87 presents us with the @entity5 wooden tool called a @entity299 that 's used to stir and froth the famous @entity238 chocolate			0
she gives us some chocolate too			0
i leave clutching my recipes , my chocolate and my new mortar and pestle			0
i use it all the time -- and smile			0
