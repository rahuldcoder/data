@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the immigration debate moves to the @entity5 , @entity3 are fully engaged			1
is it too much to ask that they also be fully informed ? not many are			0
they have strong opinions on a subject they do n't really understand			0
they know what they believe , but they long ago stopped asking themselves why they believe it			0
worst of all , as bad as the immigration problem is , some of the solutions they propose range from the nonworkable to the nonsensical			1
one proposed remedy sticks out as the nuttiest of all			0
in fact , if you love this country , it 's actually quite offensive			2
consider the interaction i had recently with a friend who follows politics			0
the son of a @entity37 coal miner and a graduate of @entity39 and @entity40 , my buddy wanted to put in his two cents about immigration -- and how to fix a broken system			2
a moderate @entity43 , he does n't support the bill that the @entity45 passed by a vote of 68 - 32 , and he is looking for something better			0
he does n't mind the idea of legalizing at least some of the undocumented , but he wants the @entity3 to secure the border first			1
he 's reasonable , but this issue troubles him -- and so do some of the proposed remedies			2
as for his solution , my friend blurted out : " why do n't we just do whatever @entity56 does ? i mean , they must be doing a good job of keeping out illegal immigrants			1
why not adopt their policies ? " @entity62			2
i hear this argument , or variations of it , at least three times a week from readers			0
i 've heard it from audiences when i give speeches			0
i 've heard it from callers when i host radio shows			0
it 's either someone 's idea of a joke or what some people consider a major breakthrough			1
here 's the back story			2
accounts in the media over the last several years have detailed how badly @entity56 treats immigrants from @entity84 who try to enter illegally through its southern border on their way to the @entity3			1
the border is often fortified , and the trip can be dangerous			0
@entity56 immigration officials sometimes look the other way and let the migrants cross the @entity56 - @entity94 border because they assume that they 're only passing through on their way to the @entity3			1
but when there is the chance that the @entity84 might stick around and find work in @entity56 , attitudes harden -- both on the border and in @entity56 society at large			1
and the standards for becoming a citizen and punishments for infractions are much harsher than those in the @entity3 how 's that for irony ? it seems that @entity56 are no more keen on losing jobs to @entity94 , @entity110 or @entity111 than @entity3 are about losing them to @entity56			1
it goes to show that people are the same all around the world			2
there is no denying the hypocrisy of @entity56 who insist on a secure border to the south but would prefer a porous one to the north			1
on trips to @entity123 to meet with government officials , i 've raised that issue			0
but that does n't let @entity3 off the hook for the role they play in this drama			1
@entity3 employers willingly and eagerly hire immigrants from @entity56 -- and @entity84 -- to do jobs that @entity3 wo n't do			1
the @entity3 household has never been more dependent on illegal immigrant labor that provides middle - class @entity3 with nannies , gardeners , housekeepers , senior caregivers and all the other comforts of what used to be an upper - middle - class lifestyle			1
should the @entity3 aspire to be like @entity56 ? is that really the solution to our immigration woes ? sure			1
it 's worked out really well for @entity56 over the past century or so			1
we 're talking about a country that people try to escape , where opportunity is scarce and where the population is divided six ways from sunday -- rich vs. poor , country folks vs. city dwellers , light skinned vs. dark skinned , the educated elite vs. the poor illiterates who serve them			0
we 're talking about a country where people routinely prey on one another , and where many of them seem to think that they ca n't have anything unless they take it from someone else			0
we 're talking about a country that takes in about $ 25 billion a year in remittances from expatriates living in the @entity3 , and has no real national economic policy beyond that and tourism			1
we 're talking about a country , parts of which remain mired in the @entity180 and an economy that -- while it has shown new vibrancy in recent years -- remains second - rate , and where immigration is kept to a minimum and where foreign investment in key industries such as petroleum is restricted			2
and last , we 're talking about a country that remains plagued by nativism and racism toward immigrants who are considered inferior to the native - born			0
is that a model worth emulating ? should we be like @entity56 ? no , thank you			2
about 100 years ago , my grandfather , and his parents , chose the @entity3 over @entity56 because it was a superior country			1
during the @entity201 , this was thought to be a safer country with more freedom and opportunity			0
that is still the case			0
now some of my fellow @entity3 want me to , in essence , choose @entity56 over the @entity3 , as if our neighbor could teach us how to behave toward immigrants			1
sure , we @entity3 have our problems			2
and our immigration system is broken			0
but , believe it or not , it is still the envy of the world			0
immigration is one thing we do right			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity223			2

@entity223 hears some nonsensical solutions to the @entity3 immigration problem
he says one of the worst is that @entity3 adopt a harsh immigration policy like @entity56 's
@entity223 : @entity56 's bad economy , other woes are related to keeping immigrants out
he asks whether we want a nation people want to leave , and where immigrants are *despised*
