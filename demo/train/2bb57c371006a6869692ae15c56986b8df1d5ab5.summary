he 's the @entity1 's own monster , a ghoul who lurks in its darkest corners and , like the @entity5 itself , has mutated time and again to suit the dreams and desires of his devotees			2
he is @entity13 , a menacing , faceless specter in a dark suit -- sometimes portrayed with octopus - like tentacles -- known to haunt children and those who seek to expose him			1
he was born in 2009 in an online forum for people who enjoy creating fake supernatural images			1
and , on saturday , police say , he played a role in the attempted murder of a 12 - year - old girl in suburban @entity27 by two female classmates who stabbed her 19 times			1
according to police , the girls said the attack was meant to impress the fictitious bogeyman			1
to be clear , the origin story of the monstrous character ( sometimes referred to as the @entity13 ) in no way urged readers to kill to earn his favor			1
but @entity13 has undergone hundreds of permutations online in his five - year existence			1
in june 2009 , a photoshop contest for images that appeared to be paranormal was launched in a forum on the website @entity45			1
according to @entity49 , a blog that chronicles web culture , the goal of the contest was to create the images and then use them to fool , or " troll , " other web users by submitting them to paranormal websites			1
site member @entity57 ( under the screen name " @entity56 " ) submitted two images to the contest , both black - and - white images of children , one of which appeared to show a largely undefined figure lurking in the background			1
they were presented as being from 1984 , and one included the text " ' we did n't want to go , we did n't want to kill them , but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time ... ' -- 1983 , photographer unknown , presumed dead			0
" ( @entity49 has documented these posts , although links to the original thread no longer work			0
) a day later , according to @entity49 , @entity57 added a third photo and a fictional doctor 's account of a mass killing			2
and , from there , @entity13 's assault on the @entity1 began			1
" some people joked in the thread , ' would n't it be funny if some of these ended up on those paranormal websites or someone said these pictures look real , ' " @entity57 said in an interview this year with @entity83 's " @entity84 " podcast			1
" but i do n't think anyone really expected that to happen			0
" other @entity45 users began creating their own @entity13 stories			1
and they spread to other sites			0
over the past five years , he 's appeared in fan art , short stories , videos , video games and other media all over the @entity5			1
a @entity103 search for " @entity13 " on tuesday returned more than 4 million results			2
" @entity107 " is one of the most popular permutations			0
it 's a video series on @entity109 , presented in " @entity110 " - like faux - documentary style , with nearly 380,000 subscribers			2
@entity13 has also been a popular subject of " creepypasta , " a form of web - based short fiction			1
a play on the term " copypasta , " which itself is derived from the keyboard action " copy - paste , " creepypasta is horror fiction written with the web in mind and , often , done in a style that makes it appear like a news item or other piece of true crime			2
the girls accused in the @entity27 stabbing told police they knew the character from the @entity133 , a site that compiles such fiction			2
the site has issued a statement condemning the attack			0
" this is an isolated incident , and does ( not ) represent ... the @entity133 community as a whole , " the statement reads			0
" this wiki does not endorse or advocate for killing , worship , and otherwise replication of rituals of fictional works			0
there is a line of between fiction and reality , and it is up to you to realize where the line is			0
we are a literature site , not a satanic cult			0
" @entity57 , too , has lamented losing control of his creation			0
" i feel like less of a creator and more of an administrator , in a lot of respects , or the manager , " he told @entity160 in the interview from january			0
@entity57 , who could not be immediately reached for comment , has filed for a copyright on the character			0
" i feel like i 'm @entity13 's manager , and he 's out there doing his thing , and i need to just kind of watch him and take care of him			2
" when can kids understand reality vs. fantasy ?			0
