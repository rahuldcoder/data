@entity0 -- defense lawyers in the trial of @entity5 's doctor want to shield jurors from commentary by @entity8 , the former prosecutor who now hosts a daily show on the @entity11 network			1
@entity15 commentary by @entity8 and others during the @entity18 trial this summer was " like a final argument by the prosecution , " dr. @entity13 's lawyer , @entity12 , said wednesday			1
while the defense has not decided whether to ask that the jury in the @entity13 trial be sequestered , @entity22 judge @entity21 hinted at a hearing wednesday he does not think it would be necessary			1
@entity12 predicted media coverage of the trial of @entity13 , charged with involuntary manslaughter in @entity5 's death , will be bigger than the wall - to - wall coverage of the @entity34 case that just ended in @entity35			1
" how many final arguments do we have to face in this case ? " @entity12 asked			0
" are we going to face the one in the courtroom and the one when they go home ? " @entity8 addressed the issue wednesday during her eponymous show			0
" the doctor charged in the death of music superstar @entity5 , killing him allegedly with a powerful propofol anesthesia , wants the jury sequestered , from me ! from @entity48 ! " she said			1
" claiming watching ' @entity8 ' will prevent a fair trial ; that the jury will be biased			1
so i guess that makes us , umm ... the good guys ! " keeping jurors in a hotel , with deputies watching over them , for two months would be expensive for the @entity0 court system , which is already suffering under tight budget constraints			1
@entity11 , which carries @entity8 's nightly show , is owned by @entity60 , which also owns @entity1			2
pastor announced wednesday that jury selection will begin september 8 , despite prosecutors ' request for another three weeks to prepare their case because of " scheduling issues			2
" jury selection was underway in may when the defense requested a delay so its expert witnesses could have more time to prepare for new experts hired by the prosecution			2
pastor then dismissed hundreds of prospective jurors and rescheduled the trial to start in september			0
the judge will visit @entity77 soon to review more than a dozen hours of raw video of @entity5 's last rehearsals for his " @entity82 " tour to decide which clips , if any , will be shown to the jury			1
lawyers for each side spent the past two weeks viewing more than 100 hours of video , narrowing down what they thought was relevant to the case			0
the prosecution selected 12 hours of video , while the defense identified four			0
@entity12 said the video showed him that @entity5 was " very talented , that he 's pretty good ; even on his bad days , he 's good			2
" the defense was looking for clues in the video to show that @entity5 was in ill health in his final days , but @entity12 said it was not detectable in his performance video			0
@entity5 also did not appear to be depressed in his final days , he said			0
the defense will argue that none of the " @entity82 " video is relevant to the criminal trial and would be " a big waste of time			0
" " it shows him onstage performing , " @entity12 said			0
" i do n't know why that 's relevant as to what happened the night that he died when he could n't sleep			0
" @entity5 's death on june 25 , 2009 , was from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol , combined with other drugs , the @entity0 coroner ruled			1
@entity13 , whom @entity5 hired to care for him as he prepared for his comeback concerts in @entity116 , allegedly administered the fatal dose .			2
