in a decision that goes strongly against @entity3 , @entity1 's highest court has ruled search engine operators are responsible for the processing they carry out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties -- and that a form of the contentious " right to be forgotten " already exists			1
the @entity13 's ruling looks like a strong decision in favor of privacy and individual rights , and against the business models of search engines and certain aspects of freedom of speech			1
it means , for example , that if a web page can be found by searching for a person 's name the search engine is responsible for the contents of that page			2
in certain circumstances , the search engine operator will be required to remove the search results and links to that page			0
@entity3 can be expected to be very unhappy about this ruling indeed , particularly given that last year 's @entity37 's opinion suggested the reverse , and the court generally follows such guidance			1
what is the right to be forgotten ? one of the perennial problems on the @entity44 is the idea that whatever appears is there forever			0
stories that appear discreditable -- whether they are true or not , whether they are up to date or not , whether they tell the whole story or not -- can always be found and brought to the public attention			0
the " right to be forgotten " is the idea that we have the right to wipe the slate clean , to remove outdated stories such as spent convictions from the record			0
there have been versions of this right in a number of @entity1 countries -- @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 , for example -- for some time , but for the most part in pre-internet forms , designed to stop newspapers republishing out - dated stories			2
the @entity44 has changed things so much that some suggest the law needs to catch up			0
for most people , @entity3 is the main way people find information -- so if you can prevent @entity3 from providing links to a story , to a great extent you prevent people from reading that story			1
many cases have been brought against @entity3 -- more than 200 in @entity75 alone -- demanding that links to stories be removed			1
the particular one that is the subject of the court 's ruling concerned a real estate auction of property belonging to a man who at the time had social security debts			2
it was a story from 1998 , but still discoverable via @entity3 , and despite the fact proceedings relating to the debts had been resolved many years before			2
the man successfully sued both @entity3 @entity75 and @entity3 in the @entity75 courts but @entity3 appealed , and it is on that appeal that today 's ruling was made			1
the ruling covered three issues			0
firstly , it looked at territory issues , delving into issues such as the ability for @entity3 to be sued , as @entity3 , who operates the search engine and where the data is processed			2
secondly , it looked at whether @entity3 be treated as though it controls the data on pages reachable through its search engine -- or whether it is a kind of neutral intermediary			2
thirdly , it considered if current law provides for a right to be forgotten that is enforceable on search engines			0
on all three issues , the court effectively ruled against @entity3			1
if a search engine 's business is established in a state , then regardless of where the data itself was actually processed , data protection law applies			1
in effect , if @entity3 looks to make money in @entity75 , the search engine itself is subject to local data protection laws			1
on the data processing issue , the court ruled that @entity3 was responsible as controller and on the third issue , that this responsibility implied that @entity3 would have to remove links and results where appropriate			1
specifically , the court ruled that individuals ' fundamental rights " override , as a rule , not only the economic interest of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in finding that information upon a search relating to the data subject 's name			1
" this , essentially , is a right to be forgotten			0
what happens next ? for @entity3 , this result creates a headache , and potentially huge costs			1
it could open the door to a floodgate of actions , each of which will need resolution			0
@entity3 will no longer be able to claim immunity			2
the ruling also needs to be seen in the context of the reform of the data protection regime in @entity1			1
the @entity178 dates back to 1995 , before @entity3 was even founded -- and a new @entity179 has been going through the tortuous processes through which @entity182 law is formed for the last few years			0
it appears close to completion -- it passed through the @entity184 in march this year -- and includes a formalization of a right to be forgotten			0
the story is not over , however , and it is not clear how this ruling will feed into the last stages of the debate			0
that a form of right to be forgotten is deemed to already exist in the current law could bolster the campaign of those who wish for a full " right to be forgotten " in the new regime			0
the potential chilling effect of the ruling could make those who oppose the right redouble their already considerable lobbying efforts to have the right removed from the new regulation , thus rendering this ruling irrelevant			0
as it is , however , the court has made a ruling that could have a huge impact on how search engines operate , and how we all use the @entity44			0
