-- the diabetes drug @entity2 is linked with tens of thousands of heart attacks , and drugmaker @entity4 knew of the risks for years but worked to keep them from the public , according to a @entity8 committee report released saturday			1
the 334 - page report by the @entity10 also criticized the @entity11 , saying that the federal agency that regulates food , tobacco and medications overlooked or overrode safety concerns found by its staff			1
" @entity20 have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with @entity2 and @entity4 had a responsibility to tell them , " said @entity20 senator @entity19 , a @entity21 and committee chairman			1
" patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and @entity4 abused that trust			2
" the bipartisan report also was signed by sen. @entity34 , the top - ranking @entity35 on the committee			2
@entity4 rejected any assertions saturday that the drug is not safe			2
" we disagree with the conclusions in the report , " company spokeswoman @entity39 told @entity0			2
" the @entity11 had reviewed the data and concluded that the drug should be on the market			2
" seven clinical trials on the drug prove that it is not linked to heart attacks , @entity39 said			2
" none of that data shows a statistically significant correlation between @entity2 and myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction [ heart attack ] , " she said			2
ischemia is a condition in which blood flow and oxygen are blocked from going to certain parts of the body			0
the @entity8 committee investigation stems from concerns that @entity2 and other high - profile drugs put " public safety at risk because the @entity11 has been too cozy with drug makers and has been regularly outmaneuvered by companies that have a financial interest in downplaying or under - exploring potential safety risks , " the report states			1
@entity11 commissioner @entity71 said she is waiting for the recommendations of an advisory committee that will hear reports on the drug this summer			1
" meanwhile , " @entity71 said in a statement , " i am reviewing the inquiry made by @entity78 and @entity34 and i am reaching out to ensure that i have a complete understanding and awareness of all of the data and issues involved			0
" the @entity8 report was developed over the past two years by committee investigators who reviewed more than 250,000 pages of documents provided by @entity4 , the @entity11 and several research institutes			1
committee investigators also conducted numerous interviews and phone calls with @entity4 , the @entity11 and anonymous whistleblowers			1
according to the @entity8 report : @entity11 scientists estimated in july 2007 that @entity2 was associated with approximately 83,000 heart attacks since the drug came to market			1
" had @entity4 considered @entity2 's potential increased cardiovascular risk more seriously when the issue was first raised in 1999 ... some of these heart attacks may have been avoided , " the report states			1
@entity4 undertook attempts to undermine information critical of @entity2			1
" @entity4 executives attempted to intimidate independent physicians , focused on strategies to minimize or misrepresent findings that @entity2 may increase cardiovascular risk and sought ways to downplay findings that a competing drug might reduce cardiovascular risk , " the report says			1
as an example , committee investigators say they found that @entity4 experts verified an outside study showing the cardiac problem , but the company publicly attacked the findings as incorrect			2
two @entity11 safety officials sounded a clear alarm in october 2008 writing , " there is strong evidence that rosiglitazone [ @entity2 ] confers an increased risk of [ heart attacks ] and heart failure compared to @entity129 [ rival drug on market ]			1
" they concluded and trials comparing the two would be " unethical and exploitive			0
" yet , the trial is still under way , the senators say			0
@entity4 counters that the @entity8 report relies on outdated information			1
" in essence , the report is a compilation of information and events that took place years ago , " spokeswoman @entity39 said			0
" there 's no new data there			0
" the @entity11 has evaluated at the drug , @entity39 said , and updated product labeling in 2007 to say information on @entity2 's relationship to myocardial ischemia is inconclusive			1
" the @entity11 exists to ensure patient safety , " she said			2
" that is their purpose			0
" @entity2 has been under scrutiny for years			0
the @entity157 called the drug 's safety into question in 2007			0
the @entity161 also questioned whether @entity2 was safe in 2007			0
" among patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes , rosiglitazone use for at least 12 months is associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure , without a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality , " the @entity163 journal wrote , adding that the " findings have potential regulatory and clinical implications			0
" " regulatory agencies ought to re-evaluate whether rosiglitazone should be allowed to remain on the market , " the report said			0
" health plans and physicians should not wait for regulatory actions			0
they should avoid using rosiglitazone in patients with diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular events , especially since safer treatment alternatives are available			0
" read the report in 2007 , an @entity11 panel recommended by a vote of 22 - 1 that @entity2 should remain on the market despite an analysis showing links to increased risk of heart attack			1
the vote was not binding , but a suggestion to @entity11 regulators			0
the panel also voted 20 - 3 at the same meeting in support of data that showed @entity2 increased the risk of cardiac ischemia in patients with the most common type of diabetes			0
the @entity8 report does not address the issue of whether @entity2 should be removed from the market			1
@entity0 's @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 tried to hide risks from public , according to report
