-- young and old , they have braved the freezing cold for weeks to voice their discontent			0
using snow , wood , metal and tires , thousands of protesters have barricaded themselves into a makeshift tent city , paralyzing central @entity10 and refusing to leave until their demands are met			0
undeterred by the @entity15 winter chill , the demonstrators chant day and night , sometimes to the drumbeat of sticks on corrugated iron , and take to the stage to give speeches , demanding the government 's ouster and new elections			1
for the past few weeks , billowing smoke , large fires , burnt out tires and cars as well as smashed windows of public buildings have become familiar scenes in the snowy city as protests have plunged @entity15 , an eastern @entity33 country of 45 million people , into a deep political crisis			1
some of the images beamed around the world have been particularly dramatic -- protesters knocking down a giant statue of the @entity41 revolutionary leader @entity40 and hacking it with hammers to loud cheers , explosions reminiscent of a war zone echoing around downtown @entity10 , fierce clashes and abuse			1
one protester , naked aside from his shoes , was seen being kicked and forced onto a police bus			0
the battlefield is central @entity10 , the power base of an opposition which is demanding change in the @entity56 state			0
the lines have been drawn			0
batons have been raised on both sides -- between the protesters armed with petrol bombs and stones and shielded riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets -- sometimes resulting in deadly clashes			0
but despite a crackdown , demonstrators ' morale is high with no sign of their labyrinth of tents , railings and metal barrels that have taken up @entity10 's central arteries being dismantled just yet			0
it has been two months since the first rattled demonstrators took to the streets , underscoring tensions in a country split between @entity81 and @entity41			1
but @entity15 's political unrest seems to be worsening by the day -- drawing concern from its neighbors , @entity33 states and @entity86			1
here are some key questions about @entity15 's political unrest			1
@entity15 through a protester 's eyes what sparked the protests ? the protests began in november as a @entity94 gesture , underscoring the tensions in a country split between pro-european regions in the @entity98 and a more @entity41 - oriented @entity99			1
thousands spilled onto the streets after president @entity102 did a u-turn over a trade pact with the @entity105 that had been years in the making -- favoring closer relations with @entity41 instead			1
angered by this backpedaling , the demonstrators demanded the @entity105 deal be signed , saying it would strengthen cooperation with the bloc			1
their daily protests soon escalated , drawing parallels to @entity15 's 2004 @entity116 , which toppled the government			1
but with @entity15 desperately in need of a cash injection , @entity10 cited the need for financial assistance if it were to do business with the @entity105			1
@entity102 , in power since 2010 , said @entity15 could not afford to sign the deal , alluding to economic pressure from @entity41			1
another factor in @entity102 's decision not to sign the deal is likely to have been the @entity105 's demands that he free from jail former prime minister @entity130 , his political opponent			2
the @entity116 that swept him from office in 2004 , when he was prime minister , also swept @entity130 to power			0
soon afterward , he flew to @entity138 where he and president @entity139 announced @entity41 would buy $ 15 billion in @entity15 debt and slash the price @entity10 pays for its gas			1
while unhappy with that , what inflamed the demonstrators even more , however , was the adoption of a sweeping anti-protest law by the parliament on january 16			0
the new law included provisions barring people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies and from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission			0
this sparked concerns it could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech -- and clashes soon escalated			1
last week , several people were killed and hundreds of others injured in heavy street fighting			0
the epicenter of the protests has been @entity10 's central @entity172 , @entity172 , but the demonstrators have also blocked other streets and government buildings			2
on sunday , they briefly seized the justice ministry			0
" the changes that occurred after the @entity116 were n't simply deep enough			0
this time around , it appears that the disenchantment is so strong that there is a genuine opportunity to make a fresh start , " said @entity178 , policy analyst with the @entity180 's @entity179			0
" for @entity15 this is a chance to get on a different trajectory from the one the country has been on for the past 22 years and become eventually a part of prosperous , democratic @entity81			2
" read more : @entity15 protests - 5 things you need to know what 's being done to try to reach an end to the fighting ? the leaders of three opposition factions have met several times with @entity102 and a government working group to try to resolve the crisis			1
they are former boxer @entity201 , leader of the @entity203 party ; @entity204 , of the @entity202 ; and @entity205 , of the @entity206 , or @entity207			0
the president 's foes have mainly been calling for the government to be dissolved , new elections to be held and for the protest laws to be absolved			0
on saturday , @entity102 offered a package of concessions under which @entity204 would have become the prime minister and , under the president 's offer , been able to dismiss the government			2
he also offered @entity201 , a champion boxer known as " @entity201 , " the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues and also agreed to a working group looking at changes to the constitution			0
" no deal @ ua_yanukovych , we 're finishing what we started			0
the people decide our leaders , not you , " @entity204 tweeted			0
a special parliamentary session also looked at legislation that might provide amnesty for more than 200 people arrested since the demonstrations began in late november			2
it was adjourned until wednesday , when lawmakers will continue the debate			0
how does the situation affect the rest of the region ? @entity15 is the biggest frontier nation separating @entity41 and the @entity105			1
once part of the @entity56 , the country gained its modern @entity172 in 1991 following the fall of the @entity247			0
the @entity98 -- the @entity105 , together with the @entity248 -- has been working on its relations with former @entity56 bloc countries for more than two decades , with the aim of restoring democratic rule and improving quality of life for @entity15			1
it views the decision by @entity15 , the largest of the former republics , not to partner up with the @entity105 as bowing to @entity41 pressure			1
@entity15 is something of a pawn between @entity41 and the @entity98			1
for the @entity261 , the deal would mean its reach would spread further east ; by contrast , the @entity41 see the @entity15 as key to holding on to their turf			1
@entity139 has denied that @entity138 is exerting undue influence in @entity15			2
at a long - planned " @entity41 summit " in @entity269 , @entity270 , on tuesday , where @entity15 was high on the agenda , he said : " @entity41 has always respected , is respecting and will respect the sovereign rights of all the international entities including new states that emerged after breakdown of the @entity56			1
" @entity139 also said @entity41 would stick to the loan and energy commitments to @entity15 -- agreed in december -- even if the opposition comes to power			1
@entity281 president @entity280 told reporters the bloc was ready to move ahead with the planned trade deal , or association agreement that has been at the heart of the crisis , but also urged restraint and said those responsible for violence in @entity15 must be held accountable			2
@entity290 , the @entity105 's foreign policy chief , is due in @entity10 on tuesday			2
@entity15 has made an effort to move toward @entity33 ideals when it comes to politics and human rights , but the nation is still ranked 144 out of 177 countries in @entity299 's corruption index			1
the @entity15 who have taken to the streets say they want to see a better governed , less corrupt and politically liberal country , more closely aligned with its western neighbors			2
@entity15 's economy has been slow to follow its western neighbors that were also under @entity56 control -- @entity308 , for example , where the economy has grown exponentially			2
many @entity15 hope that an @entity105 deal would offer the chance of economic recovery			1
how does this affect the @entity248 ? the @entity248 has been among the @entity33 governments calling for an end to the violence and a solution through political dialogue -- but some say it has not been the most vocal			0
@entity86 has released several statements voicing concern about the crisis , and top officials have spoken on the phone to @entity10			0
@entity248 vice president @entity325 called @entity102 on monday night to reiterate @entity248 support for " a peaceful , political solution to the crisis , " the @entity324 said			0
in december , @entity248 sen. @entity329 , who has been critical of @entity15 authorities ' use of force against demonstrators , and sen. @entity334 traveled to @entity10 and met with the protesters			2
" the @entity248 seems to be treading carefully to avoid getting crosswise with @entity41 at a moment when @entity138 's support is critical for what the @entity248 is trying to do on @entity343 and @entity344 , " said @entity336 , deputy director and fellow with the @entity338 ' @entity41 and @entity339			2
" it 's wise for the @entity248 to avoid making @entity15 into a bellwether for relations with @entity41 , and for encouraging both sides in @entity10 to seek a negotiated settlement , but some of the @entity81 are already unhappy at what they see as a lack of @entity248 leadership ion this issue			1
