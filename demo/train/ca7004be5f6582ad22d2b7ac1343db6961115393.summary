-- a double amputee sprinter has won the right to be eligible to compete at this summer 's @entity3 in @entity4 after sport 's highest court backed his appeal against a ban imposed by athletics authorities			1
paralympic champion @entity10 competed in two able - bodied athletics meetings in 2007			0
the @entity13 ruled that @entity14 , who runs on prosthetic blades , is eligible to compete against able - bodied athletes			1
@entity14 , 21 , who lost both legs below the knees when he was a baby , runs on shock - absorbing carbon - fiber prosthetics that resemble bent skis -- earning him the nickname " @entity10			2
" @entity14 , a @entity22 champion and world record holder , had lobbied the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) to allow him to compete at the @entity3 this august , but after extensive tests the @entity24 ruled in january that his j - shaped prosthetics qualify as technical aids , which are banned in @entity24 - governed sports			1
the @entity24 does allow athletes with prosthetics to compete in able - bodied sports , as long as the @entity24 believes they do not give the athlete an unfair edge			1
but friday 's ruling by the @entity13 in @entity35 , @entity36 , overturned that verdict			0
in a statement , it said that its panel had " not been persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of any metabolic advantage in favor of a double - amputee " using @entity14 ' blades			1
appeals of court decisions are allowed , but on very limited grounds			0
but the @entity13 said it did not exclude the possibility that future scientific tests could be developed which might enable the @entity24 to prove that the blades provided @entity14 with an advantage over able - bodied athletes			1
the @entity56 won gold in the 200 meters , and bronze in the 100 meters at the @entity59 in @entity60			2
he holds the @entity22 world records in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meters			1
since @entity60 , he has competed in two able - bodied races in which he finished second and last , respectively			0
@entity14 will have emphasized to the court the disadvantages he feels he has by running with prosthetics , @entity65 's @entity64 said			0
" there are disadvantages when it 's windy , when it 's raining , ( and ) it takes him longer to get up to speed at the start , " @entity64 said			0
" he will be hoping that they take everything into consideration and not just rule on how much spring his prosthetic limbs give him			0
" in november , the @entity24 carried out tests on @entity14 over two days at the @entity81 @entity80 in @entity82 to determine if his prosthetics , known as @entity85 limbs , could be considered a technical aid			2
a team of more than 10 scientists used high - speed cameras , special equipment to measure ground - reaction forces , and a three - dimensional scanner to record body mass. the scientists concluded @entity14 was able to run with his prosthetic blades at the same speed as able - bodied sprinters with about 25 percent less energy expenditure			1
@entity14 ' blades gave him an energy return nearly three times higher than the human ankle joint offers in maximum sprinting , they said			0
@entity64 described friday 's ruling in @entity14 ' favor as " groundbreaking , " and said it raised questions about the future of paralympic sports			2
" what does this do to the future of the @entity22 if he 's allowed to run in the able - bodied @entity3 ? is he actually doing a disservice to other @entity22 athletes ? does it cheapen the @entity22 ? " @entity64 asked .			0

@entity24 had ruled that @entity14 ' prosthetic blades give him unfair advantage
@entity56 , 21 , hopes to compete at this summer 's @entity124
@entity14 holds paralympic world records at 100 , 200 , and 400 meters
