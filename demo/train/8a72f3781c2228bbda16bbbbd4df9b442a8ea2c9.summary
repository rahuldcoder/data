@entity1 , @entity0 -- the renewable energy sector has received a boost with the inauguration of the world 's first commercial wave power project off the @entity9 coast			1
it is hoped that the @entity11 will provide energy for 15,000 homes			2
developed by a @entity15 engineering company , @entity14 , the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) have been towed into position three miles off the coast of @entity18 in north @entity9			1
the first phase of the project is using three @entity11 to generate 2.25 megawatts of power at a cost of nine million euros			1
if successful , a second phase will see energy generation rise to 21 megawatts from a further 25 machines providing electricity for 15,000 @entity9 homes			1
the project is a joint venture between @entity14 , @entity30 and @entity31 -- a global specialist asset manager , @entity33 ( @entity33 ) and @entity9 energy group @entity34			1
named after the sea snake @entity37 , each machine measures 140 meters in length , is 3.5 meters wide and sits partially submerged in the sea			0
@entity30 and @entity31 's @entity40 explained to @entity2 how the @entity11 work			2
" effectively what you have is four long sections making up one machine			0
between those sections are three small generating motors , " he said			0
" the four sections are all joined by hydraulic rams			0
as the waves run through the machine it pushes the rams in and out			0
the action of the rams going to and fro pushes hydraulic fluid into a high - pressure reservoir			0
that high - pressure reservoir then releases the fluid at a steady rate through a generating motor			0
" this power is fed down to a cable on the sea bed which then links back to a sub-station on shore where it is converted into useable electricity			2
the @entity11 are , of course , reliant on the weather			0
depending on the wave resource , @entity37 predict that the machines will on average produce 25 - 40 percent of their full power output over the course of a year			1
when the full array of 25 machines are in place it is calculated that around 60,000 tons of @entity79 will be displaced			1
if wave power was fully exploited , the @entity80 estimates that one - two billion tons of @entity79 could be displaced every year			1
@entity82 , emeritus professor of energy conversion at @entity84 in @entity0 , gave this latest development in wave power a cautious welcome			1
" it 's extraordinarily difficult to design a machine that will cope with the extreme violence of waves			2
some wave machines are under the surface all the time -- but they are not as well developed as yet			1
@entity37 lies in the surface and it remains to be seen how successful it will be , " he told @entity2			0
" but good luck to them			0
we 'll just have to see how it operates over time and how it copes with serious weather conditions			0
" professor @entity82 , a founding chairman of the @entity103 and @entity104 ( @entity105 ) at @entity106 , @entity107 , is convinced of the potential of wave power engineering but says it is still in its infancy			1
" a few years ago when i was talking about a 500 - kilowatt @entity113 machine , i was asked by a reporter how many of these we would need to replace the two nuclear power stations in @entity15 , and the answer is 10,000			2
that puts things into perspective			0

@entity122 's first commercial wave power project is inaugurated off the @entity9 coast
the *semi-submerged* machines will *initially* provide 2.25 megawatts of power
a second phase will produce 21 megawatts and displace 60,000 tons of *co2*
