-- in the @entity2 , we do n't vacation often			2
and thanks to our ever - growing cadre of mobile gadgets , some experts fear that we do n't vacation very well , either			1
smartphones , laptops , tablet computers and other devices make it easier than ever to stay plugged in all the time			1
that 's not exactly news			2
but there 's a growing awareness , and concern , that the same items designed to keep us engaged and entertained around the clock can also make it harder for us to ever actually relax			2
sure , we 're on vacation at the shore , or a peaceful lakeside cabin in the woods			1
but it ca n't hurt to whip out the laptop and check work e-mail real quickly , right ? you know , just in case something big happened back at the office			1
maybe you ca n't resist peeking at your phone to see what your co-workers are up to on @entity39			2
or , you know , to get in a quick round of @entity42 , or a game of @entity44 during that long sunset stroll on the beach			2
and never mind how many miles there are between you and the office			2
in 2011 , your boss knows you 're always just an electronic nudge away			1
as part of our @entity55 series , we talked to two authors : @entity57 , writer of " the @entity58 " and @entity59 , author of " @entity61 : a @entity62 for building a good life in the @entity64			1
" both books address finding a healthy balance in our use of technology			2
the authors shared some tips on how to keep your gadget in check while on vacation			1
on why it 's important @entity57 : if you respond to one ( work ) e-mail , you 've just opened the floodgates			2
you 've lost that barrier -- it 's gone like a sandcastle in front of the ocean			2
now that person knows that you 're really not on vacation			1
you are reachable and you will respond			2
otherwise , it 's just a slippery slope to just responding to everything			0
... it 's not giving you that clarity in your head that you 're seeking from a vacation -- the reason you did it in the first place			1
@entity98 : it feels like a small thing we 're doing			1
" i 'll just check @entity39 " or " i 'll just go into this one little game i like to do			0
" what we forget is that it actually takes you into a different state of mind			0
it 's a different type of consciousness , the digital one			0
that may not be true in 20 years , when we 've adjusted to it			0
create rules for when you can use gadgets @entity57 : say , ' thirty minutes is what i 'm going to do			1
' then close it down			0
give it to somebody else			0
@entity98 : the no. 1 thing is to set up rituals for yourself and stick to it			0
it could be once a day			0
it could be twice in a week			0
but set those times ahead of time and stick to it			0
get friends , family to help @entity98 : get other people , the people you 're traveling with , to work with you			1
work with each other on it and support each other			0
you can make it a game			0
if one person takes the plunge back into ' screen life , ' it 's easy to follow them			1
@entity146 gadgets during meals @entity57 : no throwing the smartphone out on the table if you 're out to dinner or just having family time			1
it 's really valuable keeping them put away for that period of time			0
if it has to be out , acknowledge it			0
let everybody know why it has to be out			0
if you must get extreme if you think no amount of planning will be enough to resist the urge to text , tweet , blog or browse , @entity59 suggests you try intentionally planning trips to places where coverage will be spotty -- or nonexistent			1
or , he says , you can emulate a guy who called in to a radio show he was on once			0
before he leaves on vacation , the guy gives all his passwords and user names to friends who he trusts			1
they 're under orders , on the day he leaves , to go in and change the passwords			1
when he returns , they change them back			1
do n't necessarily go cold turkey @entity57 : even if we say we 're not going to use them , we 're not going to leave them at home			1
you worry about an emergency			0
you worry about that work e-mail that you just ca n't miss. it 's not about getting rid of technology			0
it 's about managing your technology more carefully			0
@entity98 : these devices are wonderful			1
but spending all day ( staring ) into them does n't get you to a good place .			0

no @entity55 : even when we 're on holiday , our gadgets can keep us from relaxing
authors say setting rules about when to use phones , laptops and other devices is crucial
need to get extreme ? ask friends to change your *online* passwords until you 're back
