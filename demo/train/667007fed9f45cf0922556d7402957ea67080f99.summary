nobody wanted it to end this way -- the embarrassment and humbling of a side which has brought so much joy to the world			2
" you can not consider that this generation is finished , " said @entity9 midfielder @entity8 ahead of its crunch game against @entity12			1
" on the contrary , we are still alive			2
" but @entity8 's words rang hollow wednesday as @entity9 sank to a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity12 at the @entity19 -- almost as if this generation has now received the last rites			1
dumped out of the @entity23 after just two group games on the same day that @entity25 abdicated his throne and signed it over to @entity27 , the nation 's footballers have now relinquished the crown they once wore with distinction			0
those fortunate enough to have a ticket for the potential dethroning came wearing red -- @entity33 red			0
even before kickoff , there was a sense of something special -- a wind of change , a new era about to be ushered in			0
this was a moment nobody wanted to miss -- including the 85 @entity33 fans who were apprehended by military police after trashing the stadium 's media center			0
while the spine tingling a capella version of the @entity33 national anthem galvanized those in white with a call to arms , @entity9 shrunk away almost apologetically			1
it was left to @entity52 and @entity53 to put the final nails in the coffin -- both men scoring in a high - octane first half			1
there was no fightback -- no last stand , no heroics from @entity9			1
those who had once thrilled and mesmerized for so long , slowly and silently slipped away into the @entity63 night			1
this was not a mere collapse -- this was an implosion of seismic proportions			0
" we can not complain we did not deserve to go out , they were better than us , " @entity9 coach @entity69 told @entity71 tv			1
" the team showed character , we pressed forward but we had little luck in front of goal			0
" we were certainly inferior to our rivals here at the finals			0
it is not the moment to think about the future			0
little by little we will make the necessary assessments			0
" @entity9 had left @entity85 last friday , beaten , thrashed and humiliated after being dismantled with ruthless efficiency by a @entity88 side set on revenge following its defeat in final four years ago			1
it was a defeat which not only brought a shattering halt to the domination it had enjoyed on the international stage -- it was a defeat which signaled the end of an era			0
for the past six years , this @entity71 side has thrilled those who marveled at its tiki - taka passing and ability to make the game look so effortless			2
for so long a perennial failure , its victory at the 2008 @entity105 finals ushered in a period of almost flawless football			0
victory at the @entity110 was secured courtesy of a win over the @entity113 , while it retained its @entity115 crown comfortably two years later			0
but the signs of weakness have been growing ever since it was swept aside in last year 's @entity119 in @entity120			0
the 3 - 0 defeat by the host nation in the final shocked not only seasoned observers but also those who had believed @entity9 's domination would surely continue			1
a year on , and the weaknesses which were so ruthlessly exposed were laid bare for all to see			0
after the 5 - 1 defeat by the @entity88 , the @entity71 players spoke of how this current generation were not yet finished			2
@entity131 , the @entity132 midfielder , philosophized over how this occasion would mean " life or death " for his side			0
but while coach @entity69 would have hoped to revitalize his team by resuscitating his ailing players , @entity12 arrived hoping to inflict the mortal wound			1
where @entity12 appeared hungry and sprightly , @entity9 looked slow , cumbersome and leaden footed			1
the removal of @entity143 , for so long the dominant force of the @entity71 midfield , already hinted at the start of something drastic			0
gone too was @entity148 , the @entity149 defender , who endured a difficult time against the @entity88 -- not that he was alone			0
while 11 men in red @entity71 shirts made the short walk onto the @entity19 field , their minds appeared to be clouded , fuzzy , full of the doubt			0
no more so than goalkeeper @entity158 -- the captain , the man who despite having not featured regularly for club side @entity159 kept his place in the team			2
a dismal showing in the previous game had led to calls for him to be replaced -- but on form or not , there was nothing he could do about @entity12 's opening goal			1
@entity170 's side , playing with a joyful and often naive innocence , roared into action with a thrust which would not look out of place on the dancefloor of a club in @entity177			0
with 20 minutes played , @entity12 's ability to combine pace and intricacy cut through the @entity71 defense and @entity52 rounded off a wonderful flowing move			1
the goal came with a sense of inevitability -- @entity12 , roared on by the majority of the stadium , were rampant			1
where @entity9 faltered , @entity12 stood strong			1
where @entity9 was wasteful , @entity12 cradled possession like a mother holds its small child			1
where @entity9 sporadically threatened , @entity12 moved to strike down each and every attack			1
for a @entity23 champion to exit the tournament at the group stage is not unheard of -- @entity199 were embarrassed in 2002 and @entity200 barely competed four years ago as it exited with a whimper			2
but neither of those teams managed to dominate like this @entity71 side			0
perhaps had @entity9 managed to arrive at the interval just one goal behind it may have been different -- but what transpired was nothing short of disastrous			2
with three minutes of the half remaining , the much maligned @entity158 , the man who lifted the trophy four years ago , all but relinquished his and @entity9 's grip on the crown			1
@entity216 's 20 - yard free kick appeared simple enough to save but @entity158 contrived to punch the ball straight into the path of @entity219 , who fired home from close range			1
that self - inflicted wound proved fatal -- @entity9 never recovered			1
it tried to fight back , @entity223 missed a great opportunity from five - yards and striker @entity225 , one of the biggest disappointments of the tournaments , also went close			2
but it was more in hope than expectation			0
each and every time @entity12 moved forward , @entity9 fell away seemingly unable to cope with the pace of its opponents			1
@entity233 should have rubbed salt in @entity71 wounds with 20 minutes remaining only to send his effort wide of the post with the goal gaping			0
@entity69 even sent on @entity239 as substitute -- a man whose surname is @entity242			2
not that it mattered -- the curtain had already been brought down , the mourners had left -- the cortege was already on its way			0
@entity249 0 - 4 @entity248 @entity249 suffered a nightmare evening in @entity251 as it exited the @entity23 with a whimper			1
two goals from @entity255 striker @entity254 ensured @entity248 won at a canter after @entity257 was sent off for @entity249			1
@entity258 gave @entity248 the perfect start , turning home from close range after 11 minutes			2
@entity249 was reduced to 10 men when @entity257 inexplicably elbowed @entity254 -- and @entity263 added a second eight minutes later			1
@entity254 headed home a third just after the hour mark before clinching his second of the evening to seal the rout			0
the result leaves @entity248 needing to defeat @entity270 in its final group a game to qualify for the last 16			2
@entity249 will finish its campaign against host nation @entity120 on monday .			2

world champion @entity9 is out of the tournament
@entity9 beaten 2 - 0 by @entity12 in @entity63
@entity52 and @entity219 scored the goals
10 - man @entity249 also out after @entity248 loss
