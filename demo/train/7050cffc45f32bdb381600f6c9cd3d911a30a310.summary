the first day of same - sex marriage turned out to be a mixed bag for @entity3			1
while many couples converged on courthouses in population centers like @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 to exchange vows , other would - be newlyweds -- the majority of them in rural counties -- were turned away			2
" it was so joyous to be able to see these couples who had been together for 20 , 30 years to marry and to have their relationship respected , " said @entity14 , executive director of the @entity15 of @entity3			2
at the same time , she said , it was " painful to couples who want to get married and who were denied			0
" it 's unclear exactly how many counties issued marriage licenses to same - sex couples after federal courts ruled they could go forward on monday			1
several counties , including @entity28 , @entity7 and @entity29 ( which have the state 's highest populations of same - sex couples , according to the @entity33 ) told @entity0 they were issuing licenses , while others said they were following a sunday order from state @entity38 @entity37 telling probate judges not to issue the licenses because the federal courts lacked jurisdiction			1
@entity45 chief probate clerk @entity44 said the county would follow @entity37 's guidance and , " we will be issuing traditional marriage licenses			1
" likewise , @entity51 judge @entity50 said he , too , was " complying with an order from the chief justice late last night			1
" as of late tuesday , at least 44 counties were not issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples , while 21 were , said @entity57 spokesman @entity56			1
his group was still trying to get confirmation on two counties			0
the @entity15 's @entity3 office , which set up a hot line , received complaints from about 50 couples , @entity14 said			1
it was widely reported that some counties were n't issuing any licenses			2
@entity70 and @entity71 counties ' probate offices told @entity0 they were in that group			2
@entity14 's organization is now working to obtain a federal court order to explain " to probate judges that they 're required to follow the @entity79 " rather than @entity37 's order , she said			1
a hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. thursday in the @entity82 for @entity3 's @entity82 in @entity83 , which , incidentally , is one of the counties that reportedly did not issue the licenses			2
a call to the @entity88 was not returned			0
@entity83 has the state 's fourth - highest population of same - sex couples , according to the @entity33 , and the @entity15 of @entity3 is involved in a lawsuit filed by four same - sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in the county , @entity14 said			1
though @entity14 believes the federal courts were unequivocal in allowing same - sex marriages to go forward in the state , @entity37 -- who issued his order in response to a @entity103 @entity82 ruling , prior to a similar ruling by the @entity103 @entity38 on monday -- could n't agree less			1
in fact , had the @entity38 ruled on the issue before he sent his order to probate judges , he said he still would have gone through with it			1
" the @entity38 order does n't affect what i said , " he said			0
because the original lawsuit -- filed by a woman who , despite being legally married in @entity116 , was prohibited from adopting her partner 's 9 - year - old -- targets only attorney general @entity119 , the high court 's ruling applied only to @entity119 , @entity37 said			1
and since probate courts fall under @entity37 's authority as the administrative head of the judicial branch , he said , judges were free to disregard the @entity103 @entity38 ruling , which declined to extend a stay on @entity3 's prohibition of same - sex marriages beyond monday			1
a federal district court and appeals court had also declined @entity119 's request to extend the stay			2
@entity37 denied @entity28 probate judge @entity133 's assertion that @entity37 's sunday order was akin to then - gov. @entity136 's 1963 stand in the schoolhouse door to block integration at the @entity139			1
in @entity3 , he noted , @entity140 , or the @entity141 , makes it unconstitutional to perform same - sex marriages or civil unions			1
it passed with 81 % approval in 2006			0
( a 2012 poll says that approval for same - sex marriage in the state is 32 % , among the lowest in the country			1
) " i 'm not standing in any door			0
i did not bring this on			0
this was forced upon our state			0
this is simply federal tyranny , " he said			1
" this is not about race			0
this is about entering into the institution of marriage			0
" the chief justice , who once lost his post in 2003 for refusing to remove a @entity169 monument from a state building in @entity7 , said his decision was not based on his religion			2
unlike sexuality , he said , race can not be used to deny someone 's rights			0
race is biologically predetermined , where in the case of sexuality , " people can choose different lifestyles and no doubt they have since @entity187 , " he said , referring to the cities destroyed in the @entity185 's @entity184			0
the @entity103 @entity38 is expected to address the larger issue -- specifically , whether same - sex marriage in four states deserves the protection of the @entity79 -- later this year			2
while @entity37 does n't believe the high court has the jurisdiction to redefine the definitions of family and marriage , he concedes that if the justices rule same - sex marriage is constitutionally protected , @entity3 judges would have to honor the unions under the @entity103 @entity79 's @entity201			1
however , " i will not concur that that is a proper ruling under the @entity79 , " he said , explaining his personal beliefs			0
@entity14 and other observers believe the monday decision by the @entity103 @entity38 is a sign of what 's to come when the high court rules on the larger issue			0
" i think that tells us something about what we might expect , " she said			0
@entity37 does n't see any writing on the wall			2
" i do n't think the ruling is a harbinger , " he said			0
" @entity217 and ( @entity218 both have performed same - sex marriages			1
they should both be recused from this case			0
when you have a predisposition ... you have no right to sit on the case			0
they 're flouting the ethical rules that apply to most judges in this country			0
" @entity0 's @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
