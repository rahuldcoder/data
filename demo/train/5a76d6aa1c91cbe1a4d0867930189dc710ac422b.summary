@entity0 , @entity1 -- at first glance , " @entity6 " would seem the perfect candidate to be a supporter of @entity5			1
he has prospered during the @entity1 leader 's 41 - year reign , first as a professional and later taking care of his deceased father 's businesses			1
but , as with many things in @entity0 , a first glance can be deceiving			2
" ninety percent of the people in @entity0 hate @entity5 , " @entity6 told me over sips of espresso at a corner coffee shop this weekend			1
" all his people do is tell lies			2
if anyone tells you different they are just afraid			2
" @entity2 is withholding his real name for his own safety			1
on an almost hourly basis , regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that @entity0 is a stronghold of @entity5 and that dissent has vanished in recent months			1
@entity2 , like other media here , is under severe government restrictions			1
but i recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several @entity1			1
and according to several eyewitness accounts , major demonstrations were held against @entity1 's strongman as recently as last week			1
and in the @entity42 neighborhood of the capital , where @entity45 protests first erupted in february , the government 's propaganda bubble is quickly burst			1
while international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a @entity50 rally at @entity51 on friday afternoon , multiple sources tell @entity2 that several @entity0 neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces			1
" they were protesting right around the corner			0
they streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square , " said @entity6			0
" almost immediately @entity5 forces fired at them with live rounds			1
" @entity6 and other sources say that the group was several hundred strong			0
he claims that three people were killed and that the area was put under lockdown by government security			1
other people in the area confirmed the death toll , but it is impossible for @entity2 to independently verify this account			1
the government has repeatedly denied any @entity45 protests in @entity0 in recent weeks , including on friday			1
a taxi driver in his 20s also said that he took part in one of the protests in @entity42 on friday			1
@entity2 is calling him @entity81 -- not his real name -- to protect his safety			2
" we came out after afternoon prayers , " he said , " we were unarmed and peaceful and they just shot at us			0
" he says he a bullet grazed his arm			0
@entity81 says that unlike the rebels in the @entity90 , they do n't have easy access to weapons to fight			0
but he says , " i am not afraid			0
even though we were unarmed , i am doing this for the future of my country			0
" another protest was fired upon in a seaside neighborhood of the capital , @entity81 says , citing friends who said they were at the demonstration			2
speaking to journalists in @entity0 is risky			2
@entity5 's vast spying network means that almost anyone on the street could be an informer or worse			1
residents of @entity42 say that hundreds , if not thousands , have been summarily arrested by the dreaded intelligence " brigades			0
" they are never heard from again			0
and it seems nowhere is safe			0
@entity81 says that recently , a family he knows pinned up a rebel flag out of sight in their home			0
somehow the intelligence services found out			0
" they stormed into the house , pulled down the flag , and arrested every man in that house , " says @entity81			0
but the worst indignity of all , people here say , is they ca n't bury their dead			2
they come out and shoot you like cats , " @entity6 told me			0
" they hold their guns over you like this and shoot you like cats			0
we are not people to them			2
" regime officials will often then take the dead away , he says , not affording people a proper burial			2
" if we bury them , we must do it in secret			0

@entity2 's @entity143 gets away from @entity1 government minders to talk to ordinary people
" ninety percent of the people hate @entity5 , " a businessman says
security forces battle protesters right behind journalists ' backs , a cab driver says
the government denies there are @entity45 protests in the capital
