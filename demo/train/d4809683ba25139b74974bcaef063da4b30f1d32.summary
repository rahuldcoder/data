@entity0 -- a new window on your life may soon be opened from space -- in high quality video and in almost real - time			1
the resolution might not be clear enough to pick out individual faces but if the simulation footage proves accurate then a video camera soon to be attached to the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) will be able to show high definition movies capable of detailing your car moving on the highway			2
@entity16 , the company behind the idea , aims to stream the video for free over the web and make the data open source so you can integrate it into your own applications			1
" to track and see people moving from space is 100 % unique , " said @entity16 president @entity25			1
he explained that their images will have more pixels than most computer screens so the streaming footage will appear somewhat " downgraded			2
" but he said those who choose to pay for a subscription will have access to higher quality raw imagery from which they can glean detailed information			0
@entity16 says the video will be available between 30 minutes and two hours after shooting and the high quality footage will have a resolution down to a meter			1
@entity43 currently provides similar quality still images for some parts of the world which are made up from satellite pictures and aerial photography			2
it declined to comment on the resolution but points out that it upgraded its service in june			0
the @entity55 space agency @entity54 provides real - time video from the space station , except when it 's out of communication			1
@entity54 spokesman @entity59 says the footage is typically of the @entity11 laboratories in the day , and outside the station in standard definition when the crew goes to sleep			2
@entity25 said the @entity16 imagery will be useful for monitoring crop growth and disease , water resources and the rate and scale of deforestation			1
the company website also shows how the data could be used to help in the wake of disasters by , for example , showing emergency response teams the safest , fastest access routes			1
" developers will think of far more creative applications than we 'd ever be able to , which is essentially the internet model ... let the developers and users drive its effectiveness , " said @entity25			1
scientists from @entity89 ( @entity89 ) in @entity90 built two cameras for @entity16 ( one medium resolution and one high resolution ) at a cost of several million dollars			1
they are due to be launched on a @entity96 spacecraft from @entity97 in november , and the team hopes to see them in action in 2014			2
@entity101 , the @entity11 camera project manager at @entity89 , told @entity1 : " the key thing about this video camera is that it 's on a platform outside the space station which can point on two axes so when the space station comes over the horizon you can point the camera to a target on the ground and track it for two to three minutes -- that 's never been done before			1
" you may think the military are doing this all the time -- that they can read number plates and newsprint -- but that 's not the reality			2
you ca n't see faces ; you would n't be able to recognize someone lying naked in the back garden , so we 're not going down the route of blanking out faces because you ca n't see them			0
" what you will definitely see is cars going down the motorway			0
you 'll still be able to see lines on runways and crowds of people			0
" space expert @entity135 , who worked on the earth observation satellite " @entity137 , " said he admired the ambition of the project but highlighted some limitations			0
he pointed out that @entity11 has " an orbit repeat cycle of three days , and does n't get back to the same lighting conditions for more than 60 days			0
" the video element is really for entertainment value -- it 's nice to watch , " he said			2
but he added that delays in getting the imagery back means that you ca n't use it for practical real - time applications like vehicles moving along a motorway , and underlined that the space station is only over a specific target for less than 10 minutes as it moves overhead			1
the issue of privacy may worry some -- knowing that they can be filmed from space -- but @entity25 argues that many of us are already closely monitored by @entity161 and can be tracked by the signals from our cell phones			1
" it 's less invasive than that , " he said , adding that there will be some restrictions on the imagery that can be released to the public			0
according to @entity101 , the @entity96 wo n't allow data of their territories to be released			0
producing a camera that can survive the rigors of space is technically challenging			0
the lenses have to be made with fine precision , able to survive the degradation caused by radiation in space , the vibration at launch and keep their shape despite the extreme ranges of temperature in orbit			0
" polishing [ lenses ] has n't changed much since @entity188 -- it 's still a grinding process , " said @entity101			0
" the optical surface has to be good to 60 billionths of a meter deviation from the ideal surface			0
we 've got to have a thermal system that can keep the temperature uniform in the telescope and within certain bounds so that we can stay in focus			0
" if the mission can overcome the technical hurdles and survive the hazards of launch , @entity16 says its cameras will capture an area of the globe so large that it contains the majority of the world 's population .			1

footage from cameras due to be fitted to the space station will be streamed on the internet
@entity16 says the video data could be used to help in the wake of disasters
the company president @entity25 argues that video from the space station will be less of an invasion of privacy than current @entity161 networks
@entity16 also says its cameras will capture an area of the globe so large that it contains the majority of the world 's population
