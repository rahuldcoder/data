-- the controversial pitch at the new @entity3 stadium is to be dug up immediately			1
@entity3 's pitch has come in for plenty of criticism since the stadium weas reopened in 2007			1
@entity9 manager @entity8 branded the surface ' a disaster ' after the @entity13 semifinal defeat by @entity14 last saturday , while sir @entity15 called it ' dead ' in the aftermath of @entity18 's penalty shoot - out defeat to @entity19 24 hours later			0
in the wake of such criticism , stadium officials decided to launch a thorough review of the pitch and have concluded the rye grass surface should be replaced with immediate effect			1
the new pitch will be a different composition to the current one , which it is hoped will be better suited to the stadium design			2
although the @entity13 had confirmed there would be a new ' sand - soil ' pitch installed , it was not anticipated the work would be done until after next month 's @entity13 final			0
there have been problems with the new stadium 's pitch since it first opened just over two years ago			2
due to the number of non-footballing events , including pop concerts , which are required at @entity3 to make the rebuilding project viable , it was felt the rye - grass option was more likely to withstand the extra punishment			1
however , it has proved not to be the case , with @entity8 claiming the surface is worse than at any of the 20 @entity52 grounds			0
" when you build a new stadium , the first priority is that the pitch is good , " said @entity8 on tuesday			2
" if that 's not right the whole stadium is bad			0
" before everybody wanted to play at @entity3 because the pitch was so special			1
now , nobody wants to play at @entity3			0
" although the @entity13 acknowledge they will still need to change the pitch at regular intervals , the organisation is optimistic the work should at least allow @entity3 to restore its previous reputation for a surface of the highest standard			1
a statement read : " @entity70 is a multi-purpose venue and needs to be able to offer both a quality playing surface and a quality calendar of events			0
" the pitch has always been and will continue to be at the heart of the stadium and of the business			0
