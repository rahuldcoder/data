, " @entity6 " is the gold standard with more than 12 million subscribers as of october 2010			1
with their most recent expansion release , it seems @entity11 's hold on the market would grow even tighter			2
however , another game company is armoring up and entering the @entity3 arena			2
and it comes with a dig at the online gaming giant , calling out its fictional home planet in ads : " we 're not in @entity21 anymore			1
" " @entity28 " ( @entity29 ) is set on @entity22 , a world that apparently is a nexus of sorts for different planes of existence			1
these other worlds invade @entity22 through physical rifts and allow monsters to attack important cities and people			1
as a player , your job is to stop it from happening			2
players get to choose from two factions , guardians and @entity42			1
each has their own races and tactics to employ during the game and both can choose from four classes ( warrior , mage , rogue , and cleric )			1
the two factions are n't necessarily battling each other , but are trying to show which way is the best to save the world			1
skills are built up using " souls , " which unlock powers and allow gamers to customize their characters as they match their style of play			2
a character can have multiple soul systems so they can change their abilities as needed			0
executive producer @entity67 said the initial idea was not to create a new mmorpg , but to create a new gaming technology that would allow @entity29 to build games in different ways			1
" there were visions for some slightly less - formed ideas for what the game would eventually be , " @entity67 said			0
" it was all about ... ' think of all the cool stuff we could build if we had technology that would let us do 500 players in one place , 1,000 players in one place , big events that start up and shut down on their own			1
a world that is truly alive			0
' " @entity67 said the technology had to be created first before they could figure out what to do with it			0
@entity29 was looking for something that was social , dynamic and fun that would utilize their design to the fullest			0
the ability to track online players ' locations and keep tabs on their actions led the team to develop a fantasy mmorpg			1
@entity29 ceo @entity103 said choosing the fantasy genre ultimately was an obvious decision			0
" because of the technology ( we built ) , we wanted to take on the most established online gaming category first , " @entity103 said			0
" we felt we had what it takes to substantially address some of the shortcomings that this genre still has			1
" trion servers are broken down by function , unlike other games in which servers are devoted to particular locations in the game			0
for example , they use a set of servers to handle non-player character functions in the world , a different set of servers to handle encounters with " bosses , " and another set that handles functions directly involving the players ' characters			1
@entity67 said by dividing the servers by functions , processes can be started and stopped more quickly and easily , causing less lag and other glitches in gameplay			0
getting them to all work together seamlessly was hard			0
" yeah , it was hard , but it was well worth it			0
we 're really just now at the point we 're about 25 % into all of the things we can do with our technology and we 're looking to add more , " he said			2
" what people see in ' @entity28 ' right now is pretty revolutionary as well as a great foundation for us to keep adding more unique types of things to do			1
" the technology is flexible enough to handle the weight of the world without crashing and still be expandable for additional players or additional game features			2
" even the best fantasy @entity3 out there are still mostly static			0
they have very limited social game play , " @entity103 said			0
" they 're getting old			2
" " @entity28 " launched at the beginning of march after a beta run and a " @entity168 " run , which allowed gamers who signed up early some extra time in the world before the official launch			1
after the launch , there were some complaints about server wait - times because @entity29 underestimated initial demand			0
they doubled and eventually tripled the number of servers in an effort to get the wait - times down			0
@entity29 is also working on migrating players away from overcrowded servers to new servers in an effort to get everyone 's wait time to zero			2
@entity29 tailored the game 's elements and story to make the best use of their new technology			0
while acknowledging the fantasy gaming genre is a difficult one to stand out in , @entity67 said having the ability to get players gathered together at a moment 's notice was one of the advantages of using their technology			2
and despite the jab at @entity11 in their advertising , @entity29 believes there is room for two successful mmorpgs			2
" ten years ago , people were comparing everything to ' @entity207			0
' this year , people are comparing everything to ' @entity6 , ' " @entity67 said			1
he said talk about comparing " @entity28 " with " @entity6 " is more about gamer culture than direct competition			1
but he said there are differences that make " @entity28 " unique			1
" the fact that there is always something interesting going on in the world and the fact that the world itself can be a dangerous place and a place where there is new danger , new adventure ... gives the game a sense of urgency and banding together with other people adds a whole lot of excitement that only ' @entity28 ' is doing , " he said			1
" @entity28 " is available only on the pc			1
it is rated @entity233 due to alcohol references , blood , mild language and violence			0
there is a 30 - day free - play period included in the purchase of the game , but it then requires a monthly subscription for continued play			0
it is available in @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 .			0
