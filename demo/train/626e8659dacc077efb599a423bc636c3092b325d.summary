it was a bit awkward the first time @entity2 asked the question			1
she did n't want to offend her friends , after all , and it seemed rather personal			1
she stammered , she stalled			2
" i probably rambled for two or three minutes , " she said			2
finally , she got it out			0
what do you do with the guns in your house ? the mother of two asked the parents of her teenage son 's friends , both avid hunters			0
it 's not a new question -- about 19 million parents were asking it back in 2006 , according to a survey conducted by the @entity20			1
but in the wake of december 's @entity23 , @entity24 , school massacre -- and recent accidental shootings involving children -- it appears to be one that parents are asking more often before sending their kids on play dates and sleepovers			1
related : parents defend right to keep guns in home the @entity37 has been getting a lot more calls since the @entity41 shooting , said @entity42 , a senior manager			1
the group is behind the @entity45 campaign -- " @entity51 " -- which encourages parents to ask questions about guns in homes where their children play			1
in a discussion about guns in homes on @entity57 's @entity56 page , commenters agreed that asking the question is good parenting			1
while some parents said they would never allow their children into a home where guns are kept , others were comfortable knowing that the guns were secure			0
" you should be asking , ' are your guns locked up ? ' " commenter @entity65 said			0
there 's " no crime in having legal guns in your home			0
" injuries are rare despite incidents such as the recent death of a 6 - year - old @entity78 boy shot in the head by a 4 - year - old playmate , as well as the accidental shooting of a @entity84 sheriff 's deputy 's wife by a 4 - year - old boy , accidental firearms deaths are rare among children			1
according to the @entity90 's @entity89 , 703 children under the age of 15 died in accidental firearms deaths between 2001 and 2010 , the latest year for which the agency 's statistics on fatalities are available			0
during the same period , 7,766 children under the age of 14 suffered accidental firearms injuries -- about one injury for every million children			0
but statistics do n't matter much if it 's your child that 's shot , said @entity104 , founder of @entity105 , a campaign to make the gun question as common as asking about food allergies , swimming pools and video game limits			1
" it just shreds your family , " said @entity104 , whose own teenage brother died in a shooting			1
she started the campaign in 2009 , after learning during a carpool trip that unsecured guns were in the home of a family where her daughter had played			0
" the kids knew where they were , they could get to it , " she said			0
" that 's when my heart just dropped in my stomach			0
" she resolved to ask the family about their guns , but first she had some housekeeping of her own to do			0
her family had an unsecured gun , owned by her husband			1
after getting it out of the house , she reached out to the other family to ask about the weapons there			0
" they did n't realize that the way guns were stored in their home posed a threat to other people , " she said			1
" it was a good conversation			0
" since then , she has reached out to friends and leaders in her @entity148 , @entity149 , community to press her cause and encourage parents to routinely ask the question			1
she 's had the conversation with friends of her children probably 50 times , she says			0
it 's not about gun rights , she stresses			1
in fact , she counsels parents to make a point of saying they understand and accept the rights of gun owners to have firearms -- even loaded , unlocked weapons			1
the point , she says , is to make sure you 're comfortable with the environment where you 're sending your kids			0
@entity57 @entity56 commenter @entity171 said she only allows her children to go on playdates with children of families she knows well			0
" we pick our friends and our social circle very carefully			0
if i do n't know the parent well enough , then my kids do n't play			1
that 's it , " she said			0
" being that they are trustworthy friends , i have no problems worrying about if my children will be safe in their homes			0
" gun owner 's reaction gun owner @entity188 said he asks if guns are in his kids ' friends ' homes and how they 're secured			1
if they keep a loaded gun , he specifically requests that they remove the ammo and keep it in a separate place when his daughters visit			1
he 's not worried about his daughters finding them " because they know what to do if they find a gun , " @entity188 said on @entity57 's @entity56 page			1
he 's worried about others who do n't know how to handle a gun			1
if they do n't agree to keep them locked up or are unable to keep the ammo and gun separate , " my daughters do n't go , " he said			1
in turn , he makes sure to inform every parent whose child is visiting that he keeps a gun in the home			2
he said he keeps one gun in his home " for protection , " locked in a fingerprint - scan safe			2
he has more , but he keeps them in vaults off his property at a location that only a few trusted people know about			0
as for @entity2 , she said her friends responded well to the gun question the first time she asked it			1
the avid hunters assured her that all of their weapons were locked up in a gun safe			2
she 's gotten better at asking the question since			2
it 's part of her standard rundown now , anytime she ponders allowing her kids to visit another family 's home			0
with a curious 4 - year - old daughter she calls " the raccoon " and a 13 - year - old son -- the age of so many school shooters and victims -- she feels like she does n't have much choice			2
" i could so easily see my son or one of his friends picking up a pistol and saying , ' this is so cool ! ' " @entity2 said			0
starting the conversation here are some tips from @entity254 and @entity104 about having the gun conversation with other parents : -- start by having a family policy on firearms safety that you 're already following , @entity104 said			1
" if you 're not thinking about it ahead of time , you do n't really know what you like or do n't like , " she said			2
-- do n't make gun safety a bigger deal than , say , pool safety or food allergies , but do make sure to clearly cover it , @entity254 said			1
" blend it in with other topics , " she suggests			0
" it 's important to not make this too heavy or a subject that should n't be talked about			2
" -- do n't make judgments			2
" it 's not just what you say and the content of your question , but the manner you express your question , " @entity104 said			2
-- do n't worry about offending other parents , @entity254 says			2
she said the group 's field work shows gun owners are rarely offended by the question , but concern about opening up a rift between families keeps some parents from talking about the issue			1
" it 's a barrier of anticipation , " she says			0
-- have the conversation when kids are n't around , @entity104 suggests			2
she recounted the experience of a friend who brought up the issue when her son 's young friends were around			0
their mother froze -- she had n't told the children that a gun was in the home			1
it turns out the weapons were secured , @entity104 said			0
" but she did n't want the kids to know they were there			2
" whether you agree with that or not , respect the other family 's values , @entity104 said .			0

the @entity23 shooting and other incidents are behind the move , experts say
