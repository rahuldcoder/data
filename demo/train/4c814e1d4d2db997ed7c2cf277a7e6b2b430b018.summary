" accordingly , we have determined that a major disaster declaration is not necessary			1
" @entity13 responded with a statement alluding to @entity9 's remarks at a memorial event held days after the explosions that the people of @entity16 would not be forgotten			2
" we 'll be there even after the cameras leave and after the attention turns elsewhere , " @entity9 said then			0
" your country will remain ever ready to help you recover and rebuild and reclaim your community			2
" the @entity6 governor added wednesday , " we anticipate the president will hold true to his word and help us work with @entity2 to ensure much - needed assistance reaches the community of @entity16			1
" @entity13 's words were measured compared with those of state attorney general @entity59			2

the blasts leveled a portion of the town , damaging numerous homes , a nursing home and the town 's high school and middle school			0
according to local officials , the city is still well short of the $ 17 million it needs to repair roads , water and sewage lines and other damaged infrastructure			2
