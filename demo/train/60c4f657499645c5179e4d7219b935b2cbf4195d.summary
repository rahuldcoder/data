-- last week , @entity1 , the founder and ceo of @entity3 , announced that the @entity4 will raise the cost of his pizza 11 to 14 cents each , or 15 to 20 cents per order			1
this has caused some to gloat that @entity4 wo n't be " free " after all but will be passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices			1
for the sake of this discussion , i 'm going to ignore the fact that @entity1 is a supporter and fundraiser for @entity17 , and take him at his word			0
i 'm also going to assume that his numbers are not inflated at all but represent an accurate representation of what will happen in 2014			0
still -- this is n't news			0
opinion : why @entity17 is losing let 's start with the idea , espoused by many who oppose the law , that there is some expectation from those that support the law that health care is " free			1
" it 's not , and no one i know defends it as such			2
it costs a lot of money to enact the law : the most recent estimate is well over a trillion dollars over the next decade			0
it is referred to as deficit - reducing , however , because it lowers spending in other areas or collects new revenue , such that its costs are more than paid for			2
but no one should think that it does n't cost money			2
moreover , no one should think that individuals wo n't pay for the law			2
everything the government does is paid for by individual @entity57 , including the @entity4			1
that 's what taxes are for			2
what the health care ruling means to you some may try to argue that more than half of @entity57 do n't pay any taxes , but they are referring only to federal income tax			1
those people still pay payroll taxes , sales taxes , state income taxes , excise taxes and more			0
when you add all of those up , it turns out that nearly everyone pays taxes			0
we 're all paying for the @entity4 , just as we all pay for defense spending , we all pay for @entity80 , and we all pay for @entity81			1
no one thinks government spending is free			1
@entity57 who get private insurance in the exchanges are going to pay even more			1
even those receiving the largest subsidies will still have to pay for some of their premiums , along with additional out - of - pocket costs			0
as people earn more , their share of health care spending goes up , too			1
even @entity57 who get their insurance from their employers pay for their care			1
no one should be under the illusion that their " bosses " are generously picking up the tab			0
there are many studies that show that premiums and wages offset one another			0
employees ( read : individuals ) pay for their health insurance themselves through lower wages			1
so let 's stop attacking the @entity4 because it will mean that we -- meaning individual @entity57 -- are paying for health care			1
let 's circle back around to @entity3 's , though			1
part of what the act does is mandate that companies start providing health insurance to their employees or pay a penalty			2
since some do n't do that already , this will cost them money			0
they could take this out of profits or reduce the salaries of their executives , but they will probably do what every business does : they 'll pass it on to the consumer			0
this is as it should be			0
some companies probably keep costs down by not providing comprehensive health benefits to their employees			2
now , they will have to			0
i imagine some companies already do , which probably increases their costs , and now they will be on a more level playing field			0
regardless , @entity3 's is telling you that people who order its pizza will now bear the cost of its employees ' health insurance			1
again -- as it should be ! should people who do n't order @entity3 's pizza have to pay for that insurance ? that 's what 's happening now			1
in 2004 , for instance , more than half of @entity161 employees ( @entity162 ) did not get health care coverage through their jobs			1
more than a quarter of children of @entity161 employees therefore got their insurance through @entity80 or @entity170			0
that means @entity161 did n't pay for their health insurance ; taxpayers did			2
moreover , every time an uninsured employee had to go to an emergency department and receive uncompensated care , who paid for that ? the rest of us			0
where in the world can you get universal health care ? things got so bad that @entity186 passed a law in 2006 that pretty much targeted @entity161 to demand that it spend 8 % of payroll on health benefits or pay the difference to @entity80			1
yes , @entity161 might have had to raise its prices a bit to cover that			0
but does n't it make more sense for those who choose to shop at @entity161 to foot the bill , than for everyone , including those who do n't , to have to pay for its employees ' health care ? you may believe that we , as a country , should n't pay for care for the uninsured			1
but most of us are unwilling to let the sick , especially children , suffer			0
so we -- individual @entity57 -- have been paying for this health care , saving those companies money , regardless of whether we availed ourselves of their services			1
under the @entity4 , those costs will be the responsibility of those businesses and eventually their customers			2
my kids happen to love @entity3 's			1
some saturdays , when my wife and i go out , they will order pizza from there			0
the usual delivery runs about $ 20			0
according to @entity1 , the cost of health insurance to his employees might raise the price about 1 %			1
if it had gone up twice that because of a pepperoni shortage , i doubt it would have made the news at all			0
more than 30 million @entity57 will get insurance under the @entity4			1
tens of millions more will be protected from underinsurance , annual and lifetime limits , and unfair price increases			0
if the downside of this is that my pizza costs 20 cents more , that seems a pretty small price to pay			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			2

@entity3 's ceo said the @entity4 will raise the cost of his pizza
no one thinks government spending is free , says *dr.* @entity245
even @entity57 who get their insurance from their employers pay for their care , he says
@entity245 : more *expensive* pizza is a tiny price to pay for the benefits of health care reform
