-- january 13 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 : a problem that wo n't be solved , even if the solution is clear			2
the story and the reasons , leading off today 's broadcast of @entity0 student news ! my name is @entity23 ! first up : winter storm woes @entity25 : @entity26 is the only state in the union without snow on the ground and that includes @entity31 ! in the northeast , that snow is deep			1
when a weather emergency is called in @entity35 , which gets more than two feet of snow a year , you know it 's bad			1
more than 1,700 flights have been canceled at @entity35 's 3 major airports , though the city 's public schools stayed open			1
they 're closed in @entity42 and @entity43 , though			2
and across @entity45 , 64,000 homes had their power knocked out			2
forecasters expect 24 inches in some areas			1
some of this can be blamed on the storm system that iced out the southeast			1
and @entity52 explains how and why , that 's likely to happen again ! ( begin video ) @entity55 , @entity0 correspondent : officials knew @entity57 was n't prepared for the storm			1
in fact , over the years the city made a conscious decision not to be ready			2
historically , what 's been the attitude of the city when it comes to snow or ice ? @entity68 @entity67 , ( @entity69 ) @entity57 : well , i mean , when i was a boy growing up here it was a day off , a day or two off			1
but now that i 'm mayor , that 's fundamentally different			1
@entity73 : @entity57 has relied on two basic facts -- southern snowstorms are rare , and the best way to get rid of the snow is to simply let it melt			2
that logic fails about once a decade			2
this time the city remained shut down for days as roads became impassable			2
in fact the roads are still so bad i could n't get to the experts i wanted to interview , so i called them			2
do we have any idea of what this snow event for the city of @entity57 may cost ? @entity91 , @entity92 [ on phone ] : no , not right now			2
@entity73 : @entity94 says because a convention might have been snowed out does n't mean the city lost money			2
remember all those passengers stuck at the airport ? most would have just passed through			2
instead they spent money on hotels and ate at area restaurants			2
what about all those businesses who could n't work because their employees could n't get in ? @entity108 [ @entity109 ] : there is certainly some lost income associated with hourly workers not being able to get in and get paid			2
a lot of that aggregate output is going to be made up over the course of the year			2
@entity73 : but why lose it at all ? why not just buy the equipment to handle the snow ? i got that answer in my very next call to the @entity121			2
@entity122 , deputy press secretary , @entity121 [ @entity109 ] : a snowplow is $ 250,000			2
you would need so many of them it would be $ 100 million or more to shell out in order to truly cover all of the interstates			2
@entity73 : and that 's not likely to happen in this economy			1
there are many businesses that were unable to do business , employees could n't come in			2
millions of dollars , maybe tens of millions , maybe more , lost over what appears to be this 3 day period ? still not worth buying the trucks : @entity138 : my answer right now is no. @entity73 : and you know what , the economist says the mayor 's probably right			1
it appears that the business community , at least for now , is in agreement with the city that these events are so rare that its not worth the expense of investment of equipment and personnel			0
@entity108 [ @entity109 ] : i think that 's a fair assessment			1
( @entity156 ) @entity157 @entity25 : a tone of coming together at the @entity160 @entity159			1
yesterday , lawmakers held a bipartisan congressional prayer service in honor of the 19 shooting victims in @entity4			1
house speaker @entity165 said , " our nation mourns for the victims , it yearns for peace and it thirsts for answers			0
" later , the @entity159 planned to vote on a resolution , a statement , that spoke out against the @entity4 shooting			1
president @entity173 left @entity174 , @entity4 yesterday			1
last night , he was scheduled to speak at a memorial service for attack victims			0
the president and first lady , whom you see here , were also planning to spend time at the @entity182 in @entity183 , where they were going to visit with victims ' families			0
blog report @entity25 : we 're turning now to our @entity189 page , for some of your comments on the @entity4 shooting			1
@entity194 writes that even if the suspect is mentally unstable , he was stable enough to target the congresswoman , and therefore should be tried and thrown into prison			0
@entity198 lives in a town near @entity183 , in @entity201 ' area			0
she said she was completely shocked and that this was a horrible tragedy that never should 've happened			0
and @entity204 states , " when things like this happen , i often wonder what were the signs that he was going to do this , and why could no one see them ? " all of these comments from @entity189 / cnnstudentnews			0
and on our blog : @entity215 believes that in order for someone to carry a gun , they need to have a mental stability test			0
and listen to what @entity221 says : " this was a flaw in @entity160 defense ; there was n't enough security at this gathering to prevent the shooting from happening			1
but if we lived in a civilized country , we would n't need that security			0
" you can talk to us at @entity189 / cnnstudentnews			0
and of course at our blog at @entity235 ! is this legit ? @entity0 student news : is this legit ? @entity237 is a state in @entity238			1
not legit ! @entity237 is a state in @entity5			1
@entity5 floodwaters rising @entity25 : parts of @entity237 , @entity5 are suffering through what 's being called the worst natural disaster in the state 's history			1
massive flooding has left huge areas of @entity237 underwater			1
and it 's not just the people in the middle of these floods who 've been affected			1
some areas that were able to stay dry have been completely cut off for weeks			1
supplies had to be brought in by helicopter			0
@entity256 is where people are racing against the rising tide			0
( begin video ) @entity261 , @entity262 correspondent : the @entity264 river churned swiftly , sweeping away boats , their jetties and other huge pieces of debris			0
and the water steadily began creeping beyond its banks			0
but this was just the beginning			0
this marker on a riverside pub showed what to expect			0
2011 is predicted to get very close to the floods of 1974			1
very quickly the first streets were inundated and locals were shocked by the water 's speed			1
it 's well up there already is n't it ? @entity284 : it is			1
it 's coming up real quick			1
black : all along the river people desperately packed what they could into cars and trailers			0
they raced the water , and some kept going even when they were clearly falling behind			0
@entity294 got his family out before the floods reached his home			1
@entity298 , @entity264 resident : we 've got places to go to so we 're right with that			0
some of the lower lying guys are going to lose everything			0
@entity305 , @entity264 resident in row boat : @entity308 was halfway up the driveway			0
waist deep at the gate			0
black : we rowed with @entity312 to his home , past others with water already up to the ceiling			0
@entity312 's house is on a small hill and on stilts , but he believes it will be swamped			1
if the prediction is accurate , how high up will this come ? how much of it will be covered ? @entity322 : i would probably think up to this ridge here but not the main ridge			0
black : and all of this is just one street			0
what you are seeing here is going to be experienced by , it 's estimated , more than 20,000 homes and properties across the city			1
some people were clearly taking things casually			0
some were too casual and too slow to realize the seriousness of their situation			0
more proof of just how quickly this water is coming in			0
these rescue boats have been called out to help people who very suddenly found themselves surrounded by water			0
@entity284 : we could n't evacuate before and we just could n't go anywhere so we ended up calling the police			0
black : how would you describe what you 've seen out there ? @entity284 : it 's pretty horrendous actually			1
especially looking at the river			0
it 's just frightening looking at the power of nature there			1
black : the extent of that power will be known soon with flood waters expected to peak here on thursday			0
@entity256 , @entity0 , @entity264 , @entity5			1
( @entity156 ) @entity362 @entity0 student news : we know you want a shoutout dedicated to your class on @entity0 and there is one way to get it , so listen up , y'all ! first : have your teacher take an original photo of your school			1
it has to be an original , not taken from anywhere else			0
then : @entity377 to @entity235 , and scroll down the page to the " how do i " box on the left side			0
you click " how do i get a shoutout ? " and you follow the instructions to get your @entity384 to us			0
hope to hear from you soon ! before we go @entity25 : if you 've ever visited us here at the @entity386 , you 've been only a snowball 's throw , from the world famous @entity388			1
these days , it 's more like an ice rink			1
a place where driving is deleterious , but skating is serious ! or at least seriously possible			0
of everyone who 's ever passed through the middle of downtown @entity57 , this guy 's got ta be one of the only people ever , to do it on ice skates			1
goodbye @entity25 : at least as far as ice - see it			0
it 's like @entity388 on ice : a once - in - a - lifetime sight to ski			2
we 'll ski ya tomorrow , on air , online , on @entity408 , and probably still on ice			0
