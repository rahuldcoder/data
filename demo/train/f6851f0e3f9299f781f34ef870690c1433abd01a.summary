-- @entity2 web developers are using a new weapon aimed at fighting corruption : sites encouraging people to share stories of bribes online			1
such sites -- inspired by a similar idea in @entity11 -- have surged in the past few weeks , but they 've had a shaky start			0
interest in the idea gained widespread momentum on june 8 , after @entity2 's state - run @entity15 published a story about a new website in @entity11 called " @entity18			1
" the site encourages users to " tell us your bribe story " and aims to " uncover the market price of corruption " by making people 's experiences publicly - accessible online			1
the website 's administrators promise to use the stories " to argue for improving governance systems ... and thereby reduce the scope for corruption in obtaining services from the government			2
" the idea quickly caught on in @entity2 , where analysts have said corruption is a serious problem			1
official statistics on government corruption are hard to come by , but a 2007 report from the @entity40 argued that corruption threatens @entity2 's future , fueling socioeconomic inequality and social unrest			1
within days of the @entity15 story , several homegrown @entity2 spinoffs had emerged			2
visitors began posting hundreds of " tips " under headings like " local officials ... are buying luxury villas at a small fraction of the market value , " and " high - ranking official with 146 mistresses writes a letter to his son			0
" some contained documentation to back up the claims ; others posted the names of the parties accused with no supporting evidence			0
but a week later , the state - run @entity64 reported that the government had declared " citizens ' anti-corruption websites , " as they had come to be known , illegal			1
it was a move many predicted			0
" people share these websites with one another saying they want to see how long they 'll last before they get shut down or blocked			2
( their ) pessimistic attitudes are not unfounded , " media critic @entity73 wrote in a june 13 editorial posted on multiple @entity2 newspapers ' websites			1
" in fact , up til now , there has been no shortage of channels for fighting corruption			0
but in reality , posts ( that expose corruption ) get deleted ; people who file complaints about local government with higher levels of government get sent away ; and ( corruption ) tipsters get shipped from province to province			1
" within days , @entity73 's article itself had been removed from several state - run websites			1
but last week , an unlikely coalition emerged against the government 's declaration : @entity2 internet freedom activists and the @entity101 - supported @entity100 newspaper , which published an op - ed that argued against the ban on this class of website			1
" instead of shutting down these websites because of legal issues , the government should take this opportunity to work with the few websites that genuinely want to help , so that they may complement official bodies to fight corruption , " the newspaper said			2
a web developer who goes by the name of " @entity116 " embodies this alliance			1
a young @entity101 member and web developer , @entity118 says his site , wohuilule.com , is the first of its kind to obtain government permission to exist			1
( " @entity128 " is a translation of " i paid a bribe			0
" ) he asked to remain anonymous for this article , saying he feared revealing his identity would put his security at risk			0
@entity0 did not see his website 's application documents , but his site was still viewable online sunday -- days after many other similar sites were no longer accessible			2
@entity118 said he believes the government is working hard to reduce corruption within its own ranks , and he sees his site as " a very specific resource for tips " for the government officials who investigate corruption claims			2
" i want to reduce their burden , " he said			0
the very notion of anti-corruption websites that are vetted , potentially , by the same government officials the sites seek to expose sets off warning signals for some , who fear the sites will be used as a tool of persecution			1
an editorial cartoon in @entity2 's widely - read @entity160 newspaper showed a representative of the public security bureau smiling as he says , " please register with your legal name , address ... " in front of him , a man is sweating and hiding behind a sign that reads " i bribed.com " in @entity2			2
at least one expert says such sites pose serious ethical questions			1
" if you wanted to tarnish the reputation of the government or a department within it , or settle a vendetta , you could just get all of your friends to post claims against them , " said @entity172 , a professor at the @entity173 who has studied corruption			0
" there is no way of credibly aggregating the information to assess the magnitude of the problem , " he added			0
when asked if he thinks his site , too , could one day run afoul of @entity192 censors , @entity118 acknowledged negative consequences could pop up if people use the site for " reactionary behavior			0
" but he said sharing information will help tackle corruption			0
" positive things will come from widespread awareness			0
it 's not just a website for bad feelings , " he said			0
for now , @entity118 continues tweaking his site -- now just three days old -- and waiting for the tips to come in .			0

@entity2 state media reports " citizens ' anti-corruption websites " are illegal
