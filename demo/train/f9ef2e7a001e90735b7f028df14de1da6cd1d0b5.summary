-- @entity1 is open to the idea of bringing @entity3 back to life on the silver screen in 2015 , according to sources close to the just - announced " @entity8 " sequel , but do n't be surprised if his contract includes a mandatory death scene for the sly old space smuggler			1
" @entity1 is open to the idea of doing the movie and he 's upbeat about it , all three of them are , " said one highly placed source , referring to @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 , the trio that made a hyper - speed jump to global fame on may 25 , 1977 , the opening night for @entity20 's original " @entity8 " film			1
the @entity26 trajectories of @entity14 and @entity15 led to reinvention — he 's now an in - demand voice actor ; she used a gift for acerbic memoir to deliver " @entity31 " and " @entity32			2
" but @entity13 , who reached his 35th birthday in the summer of 1977 , launched himself on a truly historic career run that synced up with the blockbuster bonanza of the 1980s			2
@entity13 's star rose with " @entity38 , " " @entity39 , " " @entity40 , " " @entity41 , " " @entity42 , " and of course , the four fedora films as a certain archaeologist named @entity46			2
@entity0 : who should direct new ' @entity8 ' movie ? the actor , now 70 , is plenty proud of @entity46 , @entity51 , @entity52 and dr. @entity53 , but in the past he did n't disguise his disdain for @entity3			1
" as a character he was not so interesting to me , " the frosty @entity1 explained in an @entity56 interview in 2010			2
the slippery @entity60 pilot 's great talent is keeping himself alive , a skill that apparently extended beyond the screen			0
@entity3 's death scene in early outlines for " @entity65 : @entity70 " was scrapped , according to @entity13 and others , because the character was a top - seller as an action figure			1
as @entity1 told @entity56 in the same interview : " i thought he should have died in the last one to give it some bottom ... @entity20 did n't think there was any future in dead @entity3 toys			1
" @entity78 , which acquired @entity79 in a $ 4.05 billion deal , sees plenty of retail future with " @entity8 " sitting on the same corporate toy shelf as @entity84 and @entity85 , and they 'll certainly be offering a stellar payday to coax @entity13 to bring his star power back to role that started it all			1
' @entity8 ' : where are they now ? more than money , @entity13 might be drawn back by the upside of changes at @entity79 , where the respected @entity94 is taking over as company president , and with the @entity97 franchise as a whole now that @entity94 is in as executive producer and @entity20 will take on a consultant role , leaving the director 's chair for someone else			1
indeed , @entity13 wo n't go to the next level of contract talks until there 's a script and director in place			1
@entity110 could be a deal breaker			0
still , at any stage , an " upbeat " signal from @entity13 on any @entity3 matter is enough to shock and excite fans who view " @entity8 " as something close to religion			1
solo , @entity120 ( @entity14 ) , and princess @entity121 ( @entity15 ) appeared in two more films , and when last we left them ( in 1983 's " @entity70 " ) , they were on the forest moon of @entity126 reflecting on the downfall ( literally ) of the @entity128 and @entity130 's final act of redemption			0
now a new - look @entity79 — with @entity20 moving into retirement and the @entity78 taking over — plans to circle back with a new trilogy that picks up the story decades later and presumably uses the original trio to hand off the franchise to a new generation			2
( it 's a familiar approach ; 2009 's " @entity141 " beamed @entity142 back aboard , or 2010 's " @entity143 " turned to @entity144 to initiate the next cycle			0
) @entity14 told @entity0 that he and @entity15 heard about the idea when @entity20 summoned them for a lunch in august , not long after both were onstage return guest at " @entity151 , " an official @entity79 event that drew tens of thousands of fans to @entity154			2
many of those true believers are delirious about the new hope of a third trilogy but @entity14 , 61 , knows that some outsiders will roll their eyes			0
" i can see both sides of it , " @entity14 said			0
" because in a way , there was a beginning , a middle , and an end and we all lived happily ever after and that 's the way it should be — and it 's great that people have fond memories , if they do have fond memories			0
but on the other hand , there 's this ravenous desire on the part of the true believers to have more and more and more material			0
" @entity0 exclusive : @entity14 weighs in on the future of ' @entity8 ' in the 29 years since the red carpet premiere of " @entity70 , " @entity13 has declined hundreds -- if not thousands — of offers to appear at " @entity8 " events and cast reunions , even the ones sanctioned and run by @entity79			1
in fact , in all those years there was only one offer he accepted : he attended a 30th anniversary screening of the " @entity194 " in 2010 to benefit @entity195			0
about 400 fans ( including @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 ) paid $ 100 - $ 175 each to hear @entity13 reflect on his @entity201 days			1
i was the moderator for the event and the star arrived in a cheery mood but , after watching the film , he was weary of the crowd 's zeal for something he could never love			0
" i do n't know that i understood it very well , " @entity1 said in a flat tone of the franchise 's ascension in popular culture			2
" i 'm not sure i understand it yet ... i was very happy to be involved			0
i was pleased to be a part of an ensemble			0
" it was a bare - bones answer but still the crowd cheered and no one asked for a refund -- everyone was just excited to see @entity1 back in the same theater as the " @entity8 " universe			1
that alone may be the force that brings @entity13 and @entity3 back together for their date with destiny			1
