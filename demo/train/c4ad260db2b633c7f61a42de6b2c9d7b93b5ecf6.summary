some lawmakers are rethinking their support of controversial anti-piracy bills that led to some websites shutting down in protest			1
the protest was in response to the @entity7 ( @entity7 ) bill , a piece of proposed legislation that is working its way through @entity12			1
a @entity14 committee approved a similar bill in may called the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , which is now pending before the full @entity14			1
the protest seemed to change the minds of lawmakers , including those that had strongly backed the bills in the past			1
" we can find a solution that will protect lawful content			0
but this bill is flawed & that 's why i 'm withdrawing my support			1
# sopa # @entity16 , " @entity31 sen. @entity31 wrote on his official @entity33 page			2
@entity31 sen. @entity34 of @entity35 , who was an initial co-sponsor of @entity16 , reversed his position			2
" i have decided to withdraw my support for the @entity16			1
furthermore , i encourage senator @entity39 to abandon his plan to rush the bill to the floor			0
instead , we should take more time to address the concerns raised by all sides , and come up with new legislation that addresses internet piracy while protecting free and open access to the @entity51 , " @entity34 wrote on a @entity44 post			2
rep @entity52 , @entity54 , an original co-sponsor of @entity7 , also said he had changed his view			2
" thank you for your concern about # @entity7			2
i have asked to have my name removed from the bill			0
however , the economic impact of @entity63 theft is real and a solution is needed , " @entity52 wrote on @entity44			0
later thursday , senate republican leader @entity65 of @entity66 joined the newly minted opponents of the bill			0
he had not previously voiced an opinion on the legislation			2
" while we must combat the online theft of intellectual property , current proposals in @entity12 raise serious legal , policy and operational concerns , " @entity71 said in a news release			0
" rather than prematurely bringing the @entity16 to the @entity14 floor , we should first study and resolve the serious issues with this legislation			1
" share your thoughts on @entity7 and @entity16 on @entity84 @entity85 , one of the websites that shut down on wednesday , returned thursday with the message : " thank you for protecting @entity85			1
we 're not done yet			0
" clicking on that message takes a @entity85 viewer to a thank you letter and instructions on how to continue fighting against anti-piracy bills that critics say could amount to censorship			1
" your voice was loud and strong , " the message said			0
" millions of people have spoken in defense of a free and open @entity51			0
" ( why @entity85 went down at midnight ) on wednesday , instead of the usual encyclopedia articles , visitors to @entity85 's english - language site were greeted by a message about the decision to black out its web page for an entire day			1
however , users were able to access its mobile site on some smartphones			0
@entity112 , a blog that took part in wednesday 's online protest but returned on thursday , said the @entity14 was considering legislation that would " certainly kill us forever			1
the legislation ... would put us in legal jeopardy if we linked to a site anywhere online that had any links to copyright infringement			2
" " in the past , the media industry has often gone after particular infringers -- people who have downloaded stuff off the @entity51 and sharing it			0
and now they 're going after websites that link to these things , " @entity126 , @entity112 's managing editor , said wednesday			2
" the bill is supposed to let copyright holders get court orders against them , and there 's all sorts of various measures for getting sites blacklisted or blocked			0
" the problem is that the measures are so wide - ranging and so open to abuse that we 're worried that sites like ours could be brought down by frivolous claims , " he said			0
while not blacking out its home page , search giant @entity143 joined the cause by covering its famous logo with a black rectangle and urging visitors , " tell @entity12 : please do n't censor the web ! " @entity7 's supporters -- including @entity152 's parent company , @entity153 , and groups such as the @entity155 -- say that online piracy leads to @entity158 job losses because it deprives content creators of income			1
the bill 's supporters dismiss accusations of censorship , saying the legislation is meant to revamp a broken system that does n't adequately prevent criminal behavior			2
but @entity7 critics say the bill 's backers do n't understand the @entity51 's architecture , and therefore do n't appreciate the implications of the legislation they 're considering			1
the controversy over @entity7 and @entity16 has turned into an all - out war between @entity176 and @entity177			1
media companies have united in favor of the bills , while tech 's power players are throwing their might into opposing them			1
( hundreds turn out for @entity7 protest in @entity186 ) " both @entity7 and @entity16 are threats not just to the @entity158 economy , and not just to all the jobs that this tech sector creates , but if they had existed , @entity193 and i could have never founded @entity195 , " said @entity187 , who co-founded the site			1
millions visit @entity195 to submit interesting links from websites , discuss them and vote on them , he said , calling it " sort of a democratic front page of the web			0
" @entity195 also went dark wednesday morning and was back thursday			0
one member of @entity12 , rep. @entity203 , @entity204 , who opposes the bills , said the unprecedented blackouts had " turned the tide against a backroom lobbying effort by interests that are n't used to being told no. " @entity203 is pushing for consideration of his own plan , the @entity213 , addressing the matter			0
( @entity213 : an experiment in digital democracy )			0
