-- it began with a sign reading " be excellent to each other , " which i printed from my computer in @entity7 type and taped to my workspace			1
i was about to launch into a series of temporary jobs to supplement my freelance writing income			1
my plan was to temp for a few months , save enough money so i could stay home and write for a while , back and forth , my intention being eventually to write full - time			1
as is often the case with best - laid plans , however , i soon discovered an unexpected goal within my temporary career : the pursuit of excellence as a way of life			1
the phrase on the sign was borrowed from the silly eighties movie " @entity29			1
" i hoped it would remind me to be helpful , apply myself fully to every task , and be kind to even the most unpleasant individuals			1
i also secretly wished people would see the slogan and take the words to heart			1
my fellow temps were skeptical			1
" people treat temps like dirt , " they scoffed			1
" you 'll be lucky if you can maintain excellence through your first assignment			1
" they had a point : i was likely to meet challenges			1
nevertheless , i rolled up my sleeves and went to work			1
@entity0 : how to make yourself more marketable the sign made its debut at a corporation that designed robots ( affectionately called " the girls " ) for the food - packaging industry			2
dubbing myself @entity56 , i typed , filed , and amused my coworkers by invariably responding " i 'll tell your fans " when they announced their departures for lunch			2
no one seemed to notice the sign until several days into the job , when i set up a videotape for a troubleshooting meeting			2
the tape showed " the girls " malfunctioning -- throwing chocolate chip cookies at each other instead of neatly filing them into their respective boxes			2
" hey , " i heard a software engineer exclaim as i left the room			2
" they are n't being excellent to each other ! " " yeah ! " someone else shouted			1
" be excellent to each other ! " later someone left a box of the girls ' cookies in the break room , accompanied by a note : " for the team			1
thanks for your excellent help			1
" not everyone embraced excellence with such enthusiasm			2
some people ignored the sign ( and the intention )			2
others were short - tempered , despite my best efforts			2
but , for the most part , my colleagues responded positively to kindness			2
they grew radiant when i told them their jade earrings made their eyes look beautiful or when i complimented them on a haircut			2
they took pride in their work when i admired the brilliant organization of a paper they 'd written			2
they opened up more to others when i inquired about their weekend and actually listened to their responses			0
when i smiled , they smiled back			0
@entity0 : 5 mistakes women bosses make on one occasion , being excellent even helped redirect the career of an unhappy administrative assistant			1
after overhearing her on the phone with her daughter , i asked if she had majored in child psychology , since she seemed especially gifted at dealing with children			0
several weeks later , she came to thank me for my observation and to say goodbye : she was leaving to open her own day - care center			0
as a longtime @entity124 student , i had been taught to appreciate small , mundane moments -- moments opportune for practicing excellence in the workplace			1
for example , seemingly endless sit - at - the - receptionist - desk moments prompted me to be aware of when someone needed a sympathetic ear			1
humdrum xeroxing moments were great for noticing harried coworkers who might appreciate assistance in meeting a deadline			1
oh - so - yawnish envelope - stuffing projects were ideal times for spotting bottles to be carried to the recycling bin and spiders that needed to be taken outside in paper cups			0
@entity0 : could flextime work for you ? during mundane moments , i came to understand that excellence was n't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me			1
on the contrary , sometimes it meant defending someone against vicious gossip or saying no to a colleague who asked me to lie about his overtime hours			0
i also realized that there were some people i could n't be excellent to , like the account manager who regularly screamed at his staff			1
there were other people no amount of excellence could save , like the typist who would rather be treated as a victim than receive any kind of help			0
eventually , i would carry my sign to more than 100 jobs in @entity169 and @entity170 , @entity171 , at universities , high - tech companies , museums , manufacturers , publishers , environmental research organizations , and even a wildlife rehab center			0
my tasks included @entity181 socks and underwear to a corporate spy whose business trip was unexpectedly extended and feeding warm milk from eyedroppers to newborn squirrels			0
after a few years of temping , i branched out			0
first i wrote two books on what @entity191 call right livelihood -- earning a living without doing harm -- hoping that others might benefit from what i had learned			0
@entity0 : 10 steps to a more organized workspace next i offered employment workshops through university extension programs and community centers , where i intended to present practical information but somehow ended up teaching excellence as well			0
meanwhile , in my personal life , i attended to my relationships with renewed commitment			1
i listened more fully and was more readily available to friends and family than i 'd ever been before			0
i was given the opportunity to test this commitment when my best friend and my father died within the same year and i was called upon to devote full - time hospice care to them both			0
i was there until their very last breaths -- my most profound experience with excellence yet			0
i finally met my writing goal and am no longer temping , though we are all temps in one form or another , since nothing really lasts forever			0
still , my practice of excellence endures			0
now , instead of a sign , i carry excellence within me as a mantra , as a presence			0
excellence has the most impact when i first focus on my own peace and happiness , and then send it out into the world			0
