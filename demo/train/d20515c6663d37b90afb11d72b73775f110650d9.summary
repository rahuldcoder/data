@entity0 -- president @entity2 , @entity4 governors and even a @entity7 @entity6 member on friday blamed @entity7 intransigence for the failure so far to reach a deal to avert the harshest impacts of forced spending cuts set to take effect march 1			1
the increasingly strong entreaties for @entity7 to discuss a middle - ground solution with @entity2 and @entity16 showed @entity18 concern over the impasse , as well as its ability to mount a message campaign during a week that @entity22 is on break			1
at issue are $ 85 billion in mandatory across - the - board spending cuts this fiscal year that both sides agree will harm the economy and national security			1
however , the intractable ideological divide over taxes , spending and the role of government has led to another political showdown in @entity0 like those that dominated @entity2 's first term			2
the president met with @entity4 governors at the @entity18 and later told reporters that the forced spending cuts -- known in @entity0 jargon as sequestration -- were the " wrong prescription " for reducing the nation 's chronic deficits and debt			1
@entity50 gov. @entity49 called @entity7 " obstructionist , " while @entity52 gov. @entity51 accused @entity7 legislators of false claims about the issue that he said the news media reported as truth			2
" this is craziness , " @entity58 said , adding that a lack of leadership among congressional @entity7 meant " there 's nobody to deal with anymore			2
" outgoing transportation secretary @entity64 , the lone @entity7 in @entity2 's @entity6 for now , also called on @entity7 legislators to fully join the debate			1
he noted the impending cuts would mean lengthy flight delays and control - tower closures at some small airports as soon as april without a deal			2
" i think @entity7 need to step up here , " @entity64 told reporters at the daily @entity18 briefing , where he appeared with press secretary @entity74			2
this requires @entity7 stepping forward with some ideas about how to keep essential services of government running at a level that people are accustomed to			2
" at issue are the forced cuts and how they came about			0
they were mandated under a 2011 agreement to raise the federal borrowing limit , intended to motivate @entity22 to negotiate a comprehensive deficit reduction deal rather than face unpopular reductions in military and non-defense spending			0
@entity7 contend the idea came from @entity2 and continually refer to the cuts as " the president 's sequester , " while the @entity18 notes @entity7 leaders also endorsed and voted for the plan before @entity2 signed it into law			1
while house speaker @entity102 and other @entity7 leaders say they want to replace the forced cuts with other spending reductions that would be less harmful , some @entity7 legislators contend the across - the - board approach of sequestration is a good start			1
" it 's the least we can do , " conservative sen. @entity109 , @entity110 , said friday on @entity111			1
" we have to slow down spending			0
" for their part , @entity2 and @entity16 continue to push the central theme of last year 's election campaign in calling for a combination of more tax revenue from the wealthy as part of a package that includes spending cuts , rather than what they call a meat cleaver approach			1
republicans , however , reject any talk of higher taxes or increased tax revenue after conceding on that issue in the january agreement that raised rates on the nation 's top income earners			0
they want to shrink the size of government and the spending needed to run it , while @entity16 want to strengthen the safety net of federal programs that help the poor , the elderly , the disabled and other vulnerable communities			0
while both sides accuse the other of refusing to yield , the @entity4 voice was more prominent friday			0
@entity2 " has offered a balanced approach and it is time for ( the ) @entity22 to stop playing games with our jobs recovery , to stop playing games with our middle class who struggled long enough ( and ) finally see some hope , some income growth , some job growth , " @entity49 said			0
" we are seeing it in our states			0
" in an interview on thursday with the radio program " @entity163 , " @entity2 said @entity7 opposition to any further tax hikes or ending loopholes to raise more tax revenue was " the thing that binds their party together at this point			1
" " unfortunately , i think @entity7 have been so dug - in on this notion of never raising taxes that it becomes difficult for them to see an obvious answer right in front of them , " the president said			2
in an opinion piece published wednesday in the @entity180 , @entity102 labeled the spending cuts " ugly and dangerous , " saying they would diminish resources for the military , law enforcement , border security , aviation safety and other programs			1
however , the de facto @entity7 leader on the issue argued that his party 's agreement to higher tax rates for the wealthy ended the discussion on further tax or revenue increases now			0
the forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies -- but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits -- were intended to motivate @entity22 to come up with a comprehensive deficit - reduction plan sought by both sides			1
such an agreement proved impossible in the hyper - political climate of an election year , and the government - wide cuts opposed by both sides now are set to take effect			0
that would mean $ 85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013 , which ends september 30 , as part of a 10 - year total of about $ 1 trillion			0
a $ 110 billion proposal by @entity16 , which is similar to a plan by @entity219 , would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires , stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in @entity227 in 2014			1
@entity7 leaders , meanwhile , seek to blame @entity2 for the forced spending cuts so that any hardships that result , such as predicted job losses and reductions in economic growth , get attributed to the president			1
a majority of @entity236 support an approach that combines spending cuts and some tax increases to reduce federal deficits , according to surveys thursday by @entity243 / @entity242 and @entity244			2
however , another poll on friday showed limited support for reducing specific programs , such as defense , entitlements , education and health care			0
according to the new @entity243 survey , a majority of the public wants to either keep funding the same or increase it for 18 of 19 federal programs mentioned in the poll			0
the only exception was @entity236 aid for people in need around the world , with 49 % of respondents saying such assistance should be increased or kept at current levels while 48 % said it should be decreased			0
@entity1 's @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			0
