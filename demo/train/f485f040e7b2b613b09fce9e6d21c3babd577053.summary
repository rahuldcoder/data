-- the deliberate policies of @entity3 leader @entity2 and his late father , @entity4 , may have killed millions of @entity3 , either by starving them to death or sending them to die in a system of political prisoner concentration camps unlike any since the regimes of @entity11 and @entity12			1
for years , the world has been so fixated on the @entity3 's nuclear weapons that it has lost sight of reports of such systematic crimes			1
yet they are the very reason we should care that @entity3 could develop an effective nuclear arsenal			1
indeed one of the very sites of this alleged brutality â € ” @entity25 -- lies right next to @entity3 's nuclear test site			2
a recent report by @entity28 confronts us with more evidence of the @entity2 regime 's disregard for the lives of its own people and , by extension , our own			1
we 've long known that these camps were places of horror			2
@entity38 , one of few survivors , published his memoir of @entity41 more than a dozen years ago			0
one of us published the first satellite imagery of @entity25 in 2007 , finding what appeared to be its distinctive fence lines and guard posts right where defectors said they would be			0
but even in 2012 , when this detailed imagery analysis of @entity25 was published , there were still no eyewitness accounts			0
it was a place prisoners never left , dead or alive			2
still , we have accounts of what went on in the other camps			2
witnesses had told about the building in @entity58 where two parents breathed air into the lungs of their dying children before they perished together in the camp 's experimental gas chamber , and about the two children who drowned when a guard kicked them into a waste pond			2
we have heard of the guest house at @entity69 where , according to witness accounts , women prisoners were raped before the guards murdered them , and of the former athlete who was killed by a guard at @entity75 after hunger drove him to eat part of the guard 's leather whip			1
we read how guards at @entity41 would allegedly make starving prisoners race along the side of a cliff for corn cakes , and laugh each time one fell to his death			0
@entity28 has since found the first known witness from @entity25 , who says that guards there forced prisoners to dig their own graves and then killed them with hammers			1
he reports that at @entity25 , too , guards raped and murdered women , whose names we 'll never know			0
we add their fate to a long list of horrors , but at least , in some small way , they are mourned			0
until a year ago , we would have estimated that the total population of these camps was 200,000			0
today , our estimate is closer to half of that			0
the " lucky " survivors of @entity104 were apparently " released in place " when the fences around their camp were taken down , but the 30,000 prisoners of @entity58 simply disappeared			1
local residents said that a few thousand survivors were loaded onto trains in the night and sent away , perhaps to @entity25			0
the @entity28 report concluded that new construction at @entity25 could not hold this many new prisoners			1
the fate of @entity58 's survivors -- if there were any -- remains unknown			0
new imagery shows that @entity3 recently expanded three camps -- camps 14 , 16 and 25			1
the prisoners in these camps , according to witness accounts , are condemned by nothing resembling a fair trial , for things we would not recognize as crimes â € ” complaining about hardships in the " @entity129 , " escaping to find food , practicing religion , criticizing the ruling @entity4 family , or simply being related to such " offenders			2
" ( @entity3 collectively punishes the children , spouses and parents of political prisoners			1
) the world is belatedly awakening to evidence of @entity3 's crimes against humanity			2
the @entity143 's creation of a commission of inquiry to investigate such crimes is an important start , but it is only that			0
as innocent @entity3 languish , starve and die in these camps , largely hidden from view , the world must open its eyes to this deplorable reality			1
the capacity for abstract sympathy is not just the mark of human civilization , it warns us of a growing danger to all of humanity			0
just as the world once united to condemn and isolate @entity165 's apartheid regime , it must deny the @entity4 regime access to the global financial system until it closes these murderous camps forever			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 and @entity172 .			1

@entity171 , @entity172 : recent @entity28 report shows @entity3 prison horrors
witnesses tell of people *imprisoned* with little cause , beaten , *tortured* , raped , killed
two camps have apparently closed , their prisoners either freed or disappeared , they say
*writers* : @entity186 *slowly* waking up to this *depravity* . it must further cut off @entity3 financially
