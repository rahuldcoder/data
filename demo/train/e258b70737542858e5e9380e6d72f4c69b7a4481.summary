@entity6 , trumpeted the settlement with the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) as a victory for its @entity10			1
" these defendants attempted to destroy our family - owned business with a hired plaintiff who made statements that the court did not believe , " said @entity11 , chairman and ceo of @entity6 , in a statement			1
" animal activists have been attacking our family , our company , and our employees for decades because they oppose animals in circuses , " @entity20 said			1
" this settlement is a vindication not just for the company but also for the dedicated men and women who spend their lives working and caring for all the animals with @entity10 in the face of such targeted , malicious rhetoric			0
" the @entity8 was one of several animal rights groups that sued @entity6 in 2000 , alleging that circus elephants were abused			1
both parties filed dismissal papers in @entity41			0
the @entity8 confirmed the settlement , saying in a statement that " the organization does not admit to any liability or wrongdoing			1
" the court never ruled on the merits of the elephant abuse allegations , it said			0

@entity20 's cases , which include allegations of litigation abuse and racketeering , will continue against the other defendants -- the @entity61 , the @entity62 , the @entity63 , the @entity64 with @entity65 and @entity66 , a former circus employee who testified against @entity10 @entity69 district judge @entity68 deemed @entity66 's testimony tainted because he had been paid by animal rights activists and did not have standing to sue			1

" but they know where to find me			0
" the toll of the case has gone beyond a financial one , he said			0
