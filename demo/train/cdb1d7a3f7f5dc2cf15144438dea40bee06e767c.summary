editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5			1
his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published this fall by @entity10			2
@entity2 writes widely on current events			1
@entity2 says @entity14 should be questioning themselves on several key points			1
@entity16 , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- this week , @entity19 will conclude the eight - day celebration of @entity21 , a holiday that has often found its way into the political realm			2
civil rights leader @entity24 frequently invoked the story of the liberation of the @entity19 people from the @entity28 in his struggle against white oppression			0
president @entity32 made headlines last week when he hosted a @entity34 in the @entity35			0
today , @entity14 can draw an important lesson from @entity21 , this time not so much from the story that is retold during the holiday but through the rituals that are the focus of the week			1
last wednesday and thursday evenings , @entity19 gathered with families , friends and other groups to have a seder			0
these meals are not just about eating and talking , but also about learning and debating the stories of the holiday contained in a book called the @entity49			0
there is no right answer to many of the questions that are raised , and discussions change over time as the life experiences of the participants bring new perspectives to the table			2
the highlight of the seder is when the youngest child asks the four questions , asking the adults what makes these nights different from the others and then offering some possible answers			1
politicians could learn a lot from the @entity34 , particularly when one party controls both the executive and the legislative branch , and the temptation is to act in lock - step			0
@entity75 did not have enough moments of questioning and reflection between 2002 and 2006 , which many observers agree was not just damaging to the country but to the party as well			1
while there was strong private , internal disagreement among @entity75 over how to conduct the war on terror , over whether the war in @entity87 was a wise move and over the basic contours of economic policy , most @entity75 stayed silent in public			1
even when they gathered in the private corridors of the @entity35 , according to memoirs that have been published by former officials such as @entity95 , @entity75 tended to remain deferential to president @entity96 and vice president @entity97			1
historically , vigorous internal party debate has had the ability to strengthen a party politically			0
the fight that took place between @entity103 and @entity104 in the 1976 @entity75 primaries , where @entity103 pushed president @entity104 to be more responsive to the growing conservative movement and avoid making all his decisions from inside the beltway , created a @entity75 that in the 1980s was a formidable political force			1
@entity111 's insistence that @entity14 needed to rethink some of their conventional wisdom from the @entity114 and @entity115 periods , with his preference being to move toward the center , opened up a healthy debate about what @entity14 should stand for that helped result in @entity32 's victory in 2008			1
thus far , @entity14 have been more comfortable openly criticizing each other			1
@entity6 economist @entity125 has emerged as the leading liberal critic of the administration by arguing that president @entity32 is not spending enough to stimulate the economy and that his financial bailout plan will only provide @entity131 solutions that place all the risk on taxpayers			0
but @entity14 will feel less comfortable having internal debates as the elections of 2010 and 2012 get closer , as the pressures of re-election intensify and as @entity75 become more aggressive and more coherent in their attacks			1
to get the conversation started , it would be worth thinking about the four questions that @entity14 should keep asking when they get together in the next few years			1
the first is : what are the issues on which @entity14 are willing to compromise with @entity75 , if any ? the compromises will not be easy given that @entity75 have refused to endorse @entity14 proposals in the first few months of @entity32 's presidency			1
however , if the popularity of the @entity75 continues to erode and @entity32 's stays strong , there might be an opportunity for the president to act			1
compromises means giving something up , so @entity14 will have to talk among themselves about what that might be			1
the second question is : where are @entity14 willing to renege on campaign promises ? since november , @entity14 have already backed off some very big promises			2
though @entity32 ran as a candidate who promised to change the way that government worked , government reform has quickly dropped off the agenda			0
nor has the @entity35 been fully compliant with its promise to end the secrecy practiced by the @entity96 administration			0
it is natural that a party wo n't be able to do everything it said in a campaign , but @entity14 need to think about which issues they are willing to let go and which they are determined to fulfill			2
the third question is : what is the foreign policy agenda of the current administration ? this has been the murkiest part of the @entity179			0
when @entity32 ran for president , it was clear what kind of foreign policy he opposed			0
his campaign took aim at the unilateralism , militarism and pre-emptive strategy of the @entity96 administration			0
yet it is easier to be against something than for something			0
now the burden is on president @entity32 to define what he will be about in the next four years and what he hopes to pursue			0
this agenda will be dynamic and unfold as international crises occur			0
but @entity14 need to keep coming back to the questions and keep forcing the president to articulate what his goals are in this arena			1
the final question is : what are the policy priorities of the @entity14 ? this is always one of the most difficult questions for any party given that events move politics in unexpected directions			1
this @entity35 has naturally been consumed by the economic freefall and the effort to stabilize economic conditions			0
with his budget , @entity32 has highlighted two priorities from the campaign -- health care and the environment , though some will get traded away in upcoming negotiations			2
another issue that the @entity35 may make a priority is immigration reform			0
whereas the campaign established a certain framework for thinking about priorities , that framework fades as the election moves farther away			2
democrats must keep getting together , asking their own version of the four questions and insisting on internal debates			2
although the discussions can become uncomfortable ( as most @entity19 will recall from their @entity236 ) , this is a formula for making the strongest party possible			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			2

@entity240 : *passover* seders involve four questions asked by youngest
he says @entity14 should be asking themselves four key questions
@entity2 : are they willing to compromise on their objectives to win @entity75 support ?
he asks what priorities will take precedence for the @entity14
