-- a series of @entity3 diplomatic cables from early this year directly accused @entity4 of supplying advanced weaponry , including @entity7 ballistic missiles , to the @entity9 militia @entity8 in @entity10			1
@entity3 protests to @entity12 met with persistent denials , according to the cables , which were published by the @entity16 website			1
at a meeting in february , according to one cable , a senior @entity3 diplomat stressed @entity21 's concerns directly with @entity4 president @entity22 , " who bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to @entity8			1
" but just a week later , an urgent note from @entity3 secretary of state @entity26 to the @entity27 in @entity12 said the @entity3 had learned of @entity4 plans to supply @entity8 with @entity30 ballistic missiles , which would magnify its threat to @entity32			1
@entity33 wrote : " i must stress that this activity is of deep concern to my government , and we strongly caution you ( @entity4 ) against such a serious escalation			0
" to reinforce the point , the cable continues : " your interest in avoiding war should require you to exert maximum restraint , including restraining @entity8 and preventing the group 's acquisition of such lethal , long - range weapons			2
" within 24 hours , the senior @entity3 diplomat in @entity12 met with the vice foreign minister , @entity50 , to convey @entity33 's message			1
the cables described him as " clearly surprised " by the allegations			0
" flatly denying any @entity4 role in the supply of weapons to @entity8 , @entity50 contended @entity12 supported @entity10 independence , " a cable says , quoting @entity50 as saying : " you may hear about weapons going to @entity8 , but they are absolutely not coming through @entity4			1
" @entity50 then went on the offensive , according to the cable , asking : " the most sophisticated weapons are coming to @entity32 , to be used against whom ? " but the @entity3 diplomat in @entity12 commented : " even a seasoned diplomat like @entity50 could not restrain a raised eyebrow at our mention of the transfer of ballistic missiles to @entity8			1
" the following day another cable from the secretary of state 's office asked @entity3 diplomats to rally support from allies for @entity21 's position			0
it said : " we want @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , and @entity86 to make a renewed push to echo our concerns with @entity4			0
" allies should be told that @entity21 believed " @entity4 has provided or will provide guided short - range ballistic missiles to @entity8 that could target two - thirds of @entity32 , including @entity91 , from launch sites north of the @entity93			1
" the @entity93 is a river in southern @entity10			0
" our information also indicates that @entity4 has made advanced surface - to - air missile systems available to @entity8 and has probably provided training on these systems to @entity8 personnel , " the cable continued			2
in april this year , @entity32 officials alleged that the transfer of @entity30 missiles had gone ahead			0
at the time , @entity105 spokesman @entity104 said : " if such an action has been taken , and we continue to analyze this issue , clearly it potentially puts @entity10 at significant risk			0
" so why would @entity4 provide @entity8 with weapons that could destabilize an already volatile region ? another cable tries to answer that question			2
" @entity4 leaders appear convinced that arming @entity8 will increase @entity4 's leverage in bringing @entity32 to the negotiating table , " it says			1
but the top @entity3 diplomat in @entity12 suggests in a cable that is misguided			0
" @entity4 's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by @entity8 could prove disastrous for @entity4 and the broader region , " he writes			2
the @entity3 assessment is that @entity8 is far better - armed than it was in 2006 , when it fought a one - month cross-border war against @entity32			2
referring to its missile and rocket armories , a cable from november 2009 says : " this capability , if fully used , would represent a quantum leap over the damage and psychological terror @entity8 rockets caused in northern @entity32 during the 2006 war			0
" regional analysts believe that @entity8 has some 40,000 rockets as well as up to a dozen @entity138 from @entity4 .			0

@entity7 ballistic missiles would increase @entity8 's threat to @entity32
@entity3 cables accuse @entity4 of supply weaponry including @entity7 to the @entity9 militia
@entity3 protests to @entity12 were met with persistent denials , according to the cables
