report made very clear its view that the world is failing to prepare and adapt to the impacts of man - made climate change -- " in many cases , we are not prepared for the climate - related risks that we already face			2
" the challenge is n't new			2
we have known for some time that we need to act on climate change			2
this is a global issue requiring a coordinated global response and we need to make the most of the world 's talent			1
as an international ambassador for the @entity21 , the largest annual international competition for green entrepreneurs , we are fortunate to see some of the best new ideas in green entrepreneurism			1
however , while there has been a consistent number of female entries globally each year -- around 20 % -- to really encapsulate the potential of a wider talent pool we need to see that percentage increase			0
as such , it was very uplifting to see that the winners of 2013 and 2012 were women , given that we want to see an increase in female participation			1
last year , @entity38 - based @entity37 won with her start - up @entity40 which -- inspired by coral reefs -- " grows " bricks by using microorganisms for use in building construction			0
these bricks can be used in place of conventional bricks , consuming far less energy and resources and as a result having a much lower impact on the environment			0
in 2012 , @entity54 , another @entity38 - based entrepreneur , won with her company @entity55 , which uses bacteria to create biodegradable plastics for construction , toys , packaging or agriculture			0
she was driven to create more sustainable materials by seeing first - hand the use of temporary construction materials after earthquakes in @entity66			0
there are more examples from all over the world , such as the idea from @entity72 - based , @entity71 , to turn agricultural waste into particle board			0
her idea is helping to eliminate co2 by offering farmers an alternative to burning their unwanted materials			0
the impact of climate change particularly in the developing nations has a disproportionate impact on women and girls and solutions that reflect that are crucial			1
if we were able to encourage even a fraction more women to turn their experiences and ideas into reality , then we would be in a much stronger position to meet our climate challenge			1
with greater need than ever for green businesses and innovations all around the world , l want to see more women seizing these sorts of opportunities			1
as a woman who has had to overcome barriers , whether it be in my political life or the business sector , i understand that obstacles will not disappear overnight			0
to this end , i 'm about to launch and participate in a mentoring service for women who need support in achieving their ambitions and would encourage other women in my position around the world to do the same			1
women have a strong historical record when it comes to sustainability , from @entity123 who wrote " @entity124 , " which many credited with igniting the environmental movement , to @entity127 who as well as campaigning for sustainability in the fashion industry has tried to make sustainability fashionable			1
we need to build on their record			0
we should all have an interest in seeing women get ahead			2
we need to see more creative solutions to reduce climate change and we need to encapsulate a greater pool of imagination and invention			0
as a start , with less than one month to go to the close of this year 's competition , i would urge all female entrepreneurs with sustainability ideas to enter and take up the opportunity that 's on offer			2
