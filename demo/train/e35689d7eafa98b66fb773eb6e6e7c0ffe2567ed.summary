-- in some ways , a catastrophe of this magnitude could not have happened in a worse place			0
or at a worse time of year			0
we 're hearing a lot about the economic dislocation of thousands of @entity10 fishers and their families -- and rightly so			1
but the oil disaster is a much larger calamity than the @entity10 itself			1
it 's not just a regional disaster			1
the @entity10 is a large region , but its natural importance is even more outsized , disproportionate to its area			1
the @entity10 is the hourglass pinch - point for millions of migrating creatures that funnel into , breed in , migrate through and then fan out of it to populate an enormous area of the continents and coasts			1
anything that affects living things inside the @entity10 affects living things far outside it			1
certain animals that normally inhabit the open @entity33 travel to the @entity10 to breed			1
two such species , both endangered , breed nowhere else			1
the world 's most endangered sea turtle , the @entity39 's ridley turtle , ranges throughout the west @entity33 as far north as @entity40			1
but it breeds only in the @entity10			1
many are now heading there to lay their eggs on remote beaches			0
turtles are showing up on beaches debilitated by oil			2
oil kills sea turtles by both ingestion and direct toxicity , and by stressing and suppressing their immune systems			2
adults are vulnerable , but hatchlings will have an even harder time			0
@entity33 bluefin tuna -- the most high - priced ocean fish in the world -- have declined by about 90 percent since the 1960s due to overfishing			0
their west @entity33 population ranges the @entity63 of the @entity64 and @entity65 and far out to sea , but the @entity10 is the giant fish 's only known breeding area			1
@entity69 is their breeding season			0
according to a web tool that puts the slick over your home region , the vast area of surface oil is now bigger than @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 combined			1
it overlaps the tracked movements of breeding bluefin tuna			0
consequently , their eggs and larvae are presumably being bathed in a toxic soup of oil and dispersant			2
@entity89 , which is toxic by itself , also makes the petroleum more toxic			0
instead of remaining concentrated at the surface , dispersed oil pollutes the entire water column			2
instead of evaporating , the toxic components remain in the water			0
and because it 's dissolved , it passes more easily across gills and into digestive systems			2
planktonic animals become disoriented or die			0
meanwhile , of course , mats of oil are washing ashore			2
no amount of boom will protect waterbirds like pelicans , gulls and terns , because diving into the water for fish is how they eat			0
in the @entity10 in may , with the oil gushing , were loons , gannets , various kinds of herons and terns			1
also there were black skimmers that had spent the winter there but would soon leave to migrate north and , depending on species , breed all along the coast from the southern states to as far north as the @entity127 , and lakes across much of @entity65			1
some of the longest - distance migrants on @entity130 are various sandpipers , plovers and other shorebirds , many of which winter as far south as @entity134 and breed as far north as the high arctic			2
perhaps a million cross the @entity10 in may , and when they reach the @entity64 coastline , they must stop to rest and feed			1
problems with habitat and food supply have reduced many of their populations 50 to 80 percent in the past 20 years			0
when oil was just starting to smudge some of the birds on beaches now thick with it , i saw sanderlings , ruddy turnstones , black - bellied plovers and other such northbound birds			2
even among those that do not get heavily oiled , many will not make it			0
the birds ' energy budgets operate on thin margins of food intake against exhaustive expenditure in long - distance flight			0
they will not bear the additional cost of feathers sticking and functioning inefficiently , and many such birds will drop out on their way north			0
migrating peregrine falcons traveling north from @entity175 wintering areas , destined for nesting areas as far as @entity177 , are also crossing the @entity10 's marshes			1
preferentially picking off birds whose flight seems compromised , falcons will be getting disproportional doses of oil			2
all these birds can live decades and take years to mature , so adult birds killed by oil this year will mean populations reduced for years to come			2
this is a calamity not just in space but in time as well			0
some animals may be rescued			0
less possible to cleanse is the anguish on the faces and in the hearts of fishing families			0
oil companies can drill , and they can buy votes in @entity199 , but apparently they ca n't do much else			0
now that the reckoning is here , it becomes a little easier to see that we fool ourselves with the apparent cheapness of subsidized oil and that a healthy environment is priceless beyond reckoning			1
why do we fail to know this always , in our bones ? the @entity10 is not a thing unto itself			1
neither is the oil eruption			0
we are all @entity10 victims now			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

@entity10 is huge area that is *crucial* for migrating species , says @entity215
because many breed in or travel through @entity10 , impact of oil spill will be spread out , he says
@entity215 : endangered species such as @entity39 's ridley turtle breed only in @entity10
he says , " a healthy environment is priceless beyond reckoning "
