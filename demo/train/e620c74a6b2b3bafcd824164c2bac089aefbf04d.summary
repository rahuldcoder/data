-- a widespread outbreak of severe weather across the @entity3 may be one for the record books , as the @entity5 received reports of more than 150 tornadoes			1
" this could be one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in the nation 's history by the time it 's over , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity8 said			1
the unofficial number of twisters reported wednesday by the @entity18 was 151			0
the same system continued to spin off tornadoes early thursday			2
the long - term average for confirmed tornadoes in april is 116			1
" it was certainly a rare day that there were so many tornadoes that caused so much damage in populated areas , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity23 said			1
an official count is not immediately available , but @entity23 said she expects that the numbers will reveal a historic april with a record number of twisters			2
authorities were still assessing damage from the storms early thursday , and it could be days before officials establish how many tornadoes hit			1
several meteorological conditions combined wednesday to create a particularly dangerous mix , @entity8 said			0
a storm system that brought severe weather to parts of the @entity43 earlier this week headed east , a cold front was moving across the @entity3 and upper levels of the atmosphere were conducive for severe storms			0
" it is tornado season , but an intensive event like this only will occur maybe once or twice a year , " @entity8 said			0
" it 's very rare to have all these ingredients come together			1
" the deadly phenomena can be spawned from rotating thunderstorms called supercells , which can stretch across areas as large as entire counties			1
a tornado can form when a mesocyclone -- a rotating column of air -- is created within a super cell storm and is stretched to create a funnel - like structure that can reach speeds of up to several hundred miles per hour			1
" almost like when you pull the drain in your tub , " said @entity0 meteorologist @entity66			1
" the entire storm spins and is focused and angled down			0
" " when you have a storm all by itself like we saw yesterday , that 's when you get this structure , " he added			0

by early thursday , authorities said hundreds of people had been killed as storms swept through @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			2
and dramatic images of massive funnel clouds and flattened buildings left little doubt about the storms ' strength			0
" the storms are just amazingly explosive and they 're covering a very large area , " said @entity104 with the @entity105 in @entity106 , @entity107			0
with the latest outbreak , april may turn out to be a historic month for tornadoes , he said			1
" we may finish out april with more than 300 tornadoes , " @entity104 said			2

the numbers for april are definitely on a record pace			0
