@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 swept @entity0 on wednesday as protests erupted throughout the @entity1 capital the day after election results were announced			1
mobs charging election fraud burned the headquarters of the government - backed candidate and blocked roads using earthquake rubble and flaming tires			1
at the smoldering headquarters of candidate @entity17 , one man shouted that life was better under the @entity19 , referring to years of @entity1 's father - son dictatorship			1
at least one person died in the post-election violence , authorities said			1
" people are very angry , " said @entity24 , a @entity1 doctor who lives near the burned headquarters			1
" people expected there would be a fair election			2
" he accused the government of adding the names of those who perished in the earthquake to voter lists , to push the vote in their favor			1
he also said many people feared they would lose out on cash - for - work programs if they did not vote for the government			1
" we need someone who has the trust of the people , " @entity40 said			2
" it 's a very sad day for people who believe in democracy			2
" all flights in and out of @entity0 , including @entity49 flights , were canceled , said @entity50 of @entity1 's national airport authority			1
early wednesday , the normally bustling city felt an eerie quiet as residents hunkered down in their homes , fearful of potential danger on streets normally jammed with people and traffic			2
many shops and businesses remained shuttered throughout the day			2
but the quiet was pierced by large protests as thousands marched on the streets yelling that the election had been stolen from them			2
they chanted " @entity70 ! " which means bald head in @entity1 and is the moniker used by the popular musician and presidential candidate @entity69			1
some of the protesters wanted @entity69 to speak publicly			1
@entity69 had planned a news conference but canceled due to security concerns			2
instead he issued a short statement wednesday evening			0
" since last night , the ( electoral council ) put our country in total chaos by publishing manipulated results , " he said			0
" since then , the whole country reacted and is now in turmoil			0
they stood up to defend their votes and asked that they be respected			0
" i understand your frustration , " he said			0
" you have the constitutional right to peacefully protest			0
i am with you and will be all the way to victory			0
" polls had suggested @entity69 , a political novice , had emerged as a front - runner , but the @entity97 announced tuesday night that he had come in third behind former first lady @entity98 and @entity17 , the head of the state - run transportation company who was handpicked by president @entity101 as his successor			2
no candidate won a majority , forcing a runoff set for january 16 , four days after the first anniversary of the quake			2
if the results hold , @entity69 will not be in that runoff			0
the @entity109 ( @entity110 ) - @entity112 ( @entity112 ) election observation mission said wednesday the results were not the last word on the @entity1 election			1
it said candidates have a legal recourse to pursue a challenge -- and they should use it			0
the mission said in a statement that it called on the electoral council to " ensure that these claims and challenges that are part of the contestation process are treated with the strictness , transparency and fairness they deserve in this difficult electoral environment where suspicions abound			0
" a final outcome in that process is expected on december 20			0
the post-tabulation protests wednesday were largely fueled by @entity69 's supporters			0
" he 's our president , " they said			0
@entity69 's political advisor , @entity138 , said that @entity69 was huddling with his advisors to decide how he would proceed but the campaign has already said it will challenge the results			0
@entity138 said it was the government 's responsibility to ensure that the protests do not spiral into chaos			2
" we did not ask for anyone to take to the streets , " @entity138 said			0
" this is only a natural reaction			0
people have the right to have their vote respected			0
" @entity101 , barred from seeking another term , has grown increasingly unpopular for what @entity1 perceive as a lack of progress in their troubled homeland			1
and it had been feared all along that a win or runoff spot for @entity17 would trigger unrest in the @entity1 capital			1
the next president of @entity1 will inherit the daunting task of leading this @entity167 nation in its struggle to recover from years of dictatorship and poverty compounded by the killer earthquake , @entity172 and now a cholera epidemic that has sickened almost 100,000 people			1
protests erupted immediately after the result were announced tuesday night and spilled over into wednesday			0
a police commissioner in the northern town of @entity179 reported one person had died in violence there			1
in a radio speech wednesday , @entity101 appealed for calm and urged the candidates to thoroughly review the electoral council 's data			0
the council said @entity98 , a @entity188 - educated professor and a former first lady of @entity1 , led the presidential election with 31.37 of the votes			1
@entity17 narrowly ranked second with 22.48 percent of the votes while @entity69 received 21.84 percent			0
but the vote was fraught with allegations of fraud			0
@entity69 said aloud what many others in @entity1 were thinking : @entity101 would go to any lengths to ensure a win for @entity17 and preserve the power of his party , @entity200			1
the @entity202 @entity201 issued a statement tuesday saying that the @entity202 stands ready to support efforts to review irregularities in the vote so that results are " consistent with the will of the @entity1 people expressed in their votes			1
" like others , the government of the @entity202 is concerned by the @entity97 's announcement of preliminary results from the november 28 national elections that are inconsistent with the published results of the @entity218 ( @entity219 ) , which had more than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide , " the embassy said			2
the @entity219 , a @entity223 - backed local election monitoring group , had said @entity17 was running behind the other two candidates			1
@entity226 secretary - general ban ki - moon expressed concern wednesday over the post-election violence			1
he urged the candidates " to exhaust the formal remedies and legal procedures , which will allow a clearer picture to emerge			0
" " a peaceful solution to the current situation is crucial not only to confront the cholera epidemic in the short - term but also to create the conditions in the medium term for recovery and development from the earthquake , " @entity233 said in a statement			2
the anger voiced on the streets was also targeted at the @entity226 after reports suggested the cholera outbreak originated in a @entity250 peacekeepers ' camp			1
in a tense scene wednesday , protesters faced off with @entity226 soldiers from @entity254 tasked with guarding the road at the entrance of the electoral council 's office			1
no @entity264 , " protesters said , referring the @entity226 @entity1 mission by its @entity263 acronym			1
veteran @entity1 journalist @entity265 said @entity1 people were simply fed up			1
they endured an earthquake , a hurricane and cholera			0
it was time , he said , for the government to deliver			2
" this is a tough time for @entity1 , " @entity265 said			1
