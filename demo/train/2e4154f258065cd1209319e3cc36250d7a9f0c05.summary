-- he is a towering figure in the history of cinema , a colossus who has frightened and thrilled audiences in equal measure			0
now @entity8 , the famous silverback from the silver screen , is roaring and pounding his way onto the theatrical stage			1
@entity15 's 1933 classic fantasy tale of a giant gorilla has become a musical reality at the @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20 -- thanks to a six - meter high robotic puppet , and the pioneering work of puppeteer @entity24			1
" it 's been amazing			2
they 're not just praising the puppet , they are praising the character			2
that is so rewarding , " @entity24 told @entity0			0
the animatronics expert leads a 35 - strong team at @entity33 in west @entity19 and has an impressive track record in both film and theater			1
the 46 - year - old has more than two decades ' experience making high - tech puppets and counts " @entity40 -- @entity41 " and " @entity42 " among his many movie credits			2
he was also the robotic brains behind the hugely successful " @entity46 -- the @entity49 " stage show , but the scale of @entity8 was unlike anything he had attempted before			1
the rubber and rabbit fur model seen hanging off the @entity54 swatting bi-planes in the original film was 24 inches tall			2
the modern stage incarnation of @entity8 stands six meters high and weighs more than a ton			1
read this : @entity60 , @entity61 and the greatest movie puppets when the multi-million dollar project started five years ago , @entity24 originally set out to create a fully animatronic creature but ended up combining old - fashioned puppetry with modern robotics			1
" we were considering having two versions			0
we were developing other technologies that we would need for animatronic limbs to move , " he said			2
" but to cut a long story short , we were so impressed by what the manned puppet could do that we had a change of heart and said we should do the whole show with marionette puppets			1
it made much more sense			0
" suspended from the ceiling , @entity8 's limbs are manipulated on stage by 10 specially trained stage circus artists who scurry over and around the puppet , shifting his arms and legs by hand or using ropes			1
clad in black from head to toe , these shadowy figures called the " @entity100 , " work in tandem with three off - stage puppeteers -- the " voodoo " operators -- who control the mechanical functions inside @entity8			1
around 300 meters of electrical wiring are crammed inside the puppet 's steel and aluminum shell powering 16 microprocessors and 15 servo motors which move @entity8 's eyes , eyebrows and eyelids , nose , lips , jaw , neck and shoulders			1
he also makes sounds -- a vital part of making his movements appear realistic , says @entity24			0
marrying the mechanical functions of interior with the organic - looking @entity121 and latex exterior is one of the big challenges of animatronics , @entity24 says			0
" we wanted to create a puppet that was really dynamic on stage			1
one of the ways to solve that and not kill anyone or destroy the puppet or the stage itself was to make his extremities -- his arms and fists -- in a way that has as little steel as possible			2
" read this : huge mechanical beasts stalk @entity144 theme park from the elbow down , @entity8 's arms are filled with air , allowing him to furiously pound the floor without causing a minor earthquake			1
overlaying the air bags are a series of sculptured muscle bags made from a stretchy nylon material that expands and contracts to mimic the sinewy movements of the real thing			0
he might not be the largest marionette in the world - that record is held by @entity144 's street theater company @entity162 -- but he is , says @entity24 , the most articulated			1
" often ( big puppets ) are quite simple and slow , but what we 've developed is a hybrid technology enabling us to do some powerful and specific moves			0
" the @entity33 's ambitions were aided by @entity170 - based stage automation experts @entity171 who provided the four - ton track - and - trolley system suspended above the stage			1
" it 's a machine that allows @entity8 to both move around the stage and be raised up and down but also take different positions , " said @entity176 ceo @entity175			1
" we move his torso with eight winches and that allows us to change the aspect of it			0
so , for instance , when he walks , his shoulders can roll from side to side			0
it 's basically a big boys version of a wooden cross you see on smaller puppets			0
" the company , which is currently helping pop star @entity194 fly around stage on her world tour , has previously assisted @entity197 with the @entity46 project , helping create a flying prehistoric bird called an @entity200			1
but the complexity of @entity8 surpassed anything they have previously built , leading to a few nerves as opening night approached			2
" given ( @entity8 ) is the main actor it was quite a concern , but it is incredible , " he said			2
" there 's an awful lot of engineering that goes into something that looks so effortless			0
i think you have to see inferior robotic incarnations to see quite how clever ( @entity8 ) is			2
" overall , it 's been an extraordinary collaboration of engineering and software expertise with sculptors , artists , musicians and actors creating a unique spectacle			0
the critics like it too			0
many have warmed to the show itself since it opened in june and almost all have heaped lavish praise on kong himself			0
it 's only a matter of time before audiences worldwide get their chance to feel the towering stage presence of @entity8 , said @entity24			1
" it 's definitely going overseas , " he said			0
" the financial model ca n't rely on 20 million people in @entity20			0
obviously , we would love to go to @entity240 because that 's the natural home for the story			0
