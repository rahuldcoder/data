-- if you 've spent any time at all following the @entity4 - @entity3 conflict these past few years , you 've probably run into a lot of bad news			1
but what if there were another type of story about @entity3 and @entity4 that you were n't being told ? what if beyond the bloodshed , hostility and extremism , there were also hopeful examples of @entity3 and @entity4 civilians leading effective nonviolent movements to end the occupation and build peace ? the fact is that plenty of these inspiring examples exist , but the world , and specifically the major media outlets covering the conflict , have yet to give them proper attention			1
this is problematic on two counts : first , it gives anyone following the conflict a false and dangerous impression that there is no hope , and that extremists on both sides far outnumber moderates who are willing to work toward a peaceful solution			0
second , and more important , it deprives those courageous individuals who choose nonviolence of the attention they so urgently need in order to grow and spread their message			0
violence and nonviolence are , after all , two different forms of theater			0
they both depend and thrive on the response of an audience			0
@entity54 : @entity56 's plan for " one day of peace " if we , as a global audience , focus solely on violence and militarism , we reinforce the notion that they are the most effective form of action			0
on the other hand , if we pay more attention to nonviolent or unarmed efforts , we strengthen the legitimacy and influence of those choosing to use these means			0
this is why at @entity76 , our mission is to create and distribute media , including documentary films , that tell the stories of @entity4 and @entity3 working nonviolently to resolve the conflict and end the occupation			1
we also provide in - depth introductions to these visionaries by publishing new interviews with them on our website every few days			0
by providing these resources to millions worldwide , we ensure that those who promote nonviolence have an effective platform through which they can share their accomplishments and ideas with their own societies and others around the globe			0
our latest documentary film , " @entity98 , " tells the story of a @entity3 community organizer who successfully unites @entity3 of all political factions together with @entity4 supporters in an unarmed movement to save his village from destruction by @entity4 's @entity106			1
the film shows how , for 10 months , the residents of @entity98 and their supporters engaged in unarmed protest , and how they ultimately triumphed by convincing the @entity4 army to shift the course of the barrier and saving their village			1
since its release , " @entity98 " has been seen by hundreds of thousands around the world , and it will be made available to millions more on september 21 , the @entity119 , when it will be broadcast online for free			2
many of the @entity3 and @entity4 who have seen " @entity98 " have come away both surprised and hopeful : surprised to learn that a nonviolent movement they had never heard of existed on their doorstep , and hopeful that this might be a model that could inspire others in their community to take similar action			1
@entity54 : @entity130 ' realistic vision for peace though it is just one film , " @entity98 " has already begun to change the conversation on the role and impact of nonviolence in @entity3 and @entity4 society			1
the lessons of @entity98 and the dozens of other nonviolent initiatives we follow resonate even more loudly when considering recent historical examples			2
looking back at some of the great influential social movements of the past few decades , whether it 's the civil rights movement in the @entity150 , the global feminist movement or the recent @entity152 , some of the biggest positive changes to our societies have come from grassroots nonviolent activism , not the actions of governments or armed campaigns			2
given the proper stage , these movements proved that civil disobedience and peaceful protest could be more moving , more captivating and ultimately more influential than the use of lethal force			1
yet , if no one had paid attention to those first students sitting in at the lunch counters in @entity167 , or to the desperate plea of a young @entity170 vegetable salesman , who can say where those movements would be today ? where we choose to direct our attention matters			0
and in the case of the @entity4 - @entity3 conflict , this decision can save numerous @entity4 and @entity3 lives and help finally bring an end to the bloodshed			1
rather than endlessly waiting for new leaders to emerge or conditions to change , it 's time we realized that the solutions to the conflict are being played out every day right in front of us			2
it 's up to us to notice			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity189 : why do n't we hear the stories of nonviolence from the @entity4 - @entity3 conflict ?
she says the film @entity98 tells of @entity197 uniting *wth* @entity4 's in common cause , nonviolently
she says they *persuaded* @entity4 army to shift @entity106 's course , save @entity98 village
@entity206 : *people* must recognize : nonviolent protest can be more influential than lethal force
