@entity0 was once the only place to be for the world 's hippest tech firms			1
it 's the region that gave birth to all - conquering behemoths like @entity8 and @entity9 , after all			2
but fast forward to 2015 and the playground of global technology has moved roughly 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) north to @entity12			2
" information is the new currency and that currency is gushing through the streets of @entity12 , " said @entity13 , regional managing director of real estate firm @entity14			1
according to @entity13 , firms like @entity20 are relocating to the @entity12 because it offers a more attractive lifestyle to talented employees			1
" if you 're in your 20s ( or ) 30s , you want to live in a vibrant environment where you 're surrounded by like - minded people			0
where there 's a lot of interesting cultural stuff to do , " @entity13 said			2
" and with the great respect to the suburbs where @entity9 was born , there 's a lot more cultural diversity and a lot more to do ( in @entity12 ) than there is there			1
last year , commercial real estate in @entity12 was snapped up in large parcels			1
as many as 14 different companies signed leases for more than 9,000 square meters ( 97,000 square feet ) worth of space and property			1
among those leasing were tech heavyweights like @entity44 and @entity45			2
" now in 2015 , 60 % of all leases done in @entity12 are for technology companies , " @entity13 said			1
" 28 % of the top space users who occupy more than 250 , 000 square feet are technology users			1
that 's up from 8 % in the dotcom boom			2
that 's how dramatic the shift 's been			0
" these cash - rich tech firms are also changing the game by shying away from the offices of yesterday			1
beer taps , foosball tables , and bike racks are now the norm at offices in the city			0
@entity65 has seen the change first hand while designing spaces for the likes of crowd - sourced company review platform , @entity71 , and taxi app , @entity73			0
" the offices of just three or four years ago , they 're definitely more hierarchically set up , " @entity74 said			0
" you had fewer conference rooms , a lot of the work stations went to the middle			0
what we 're seeing now , we 're basically wanting to share that space			0
share the light , flatten the organization			0
" @entity65 adds that old warehouses with high ceilings in the @entity89 have become particularly popular			0
but demand has driven prices up with rates climbing for both commercial and residential properties			0
in a city that spans just seven by seven square miles space will eventually run out			2
for now though , the outlook is rosy for those riding the tech wave			0
" there has never been a time when the world 's economy depended so much on the ideas and the work product that come out of one location , " said @entity13			1
" it 's the golden age , this is an era that 's just beginning and the light is n't just shining on @entity12 for a brief moment in time			1
i firmly believe this is going to last long into the future			0

some of the world 's biggest tech firms are moving into @entity12
14 different companies signed leases for more than 97,000 square feet worth of space and property in 2014
real estate firms say @entity12 has more to offer the employees of tech firms
