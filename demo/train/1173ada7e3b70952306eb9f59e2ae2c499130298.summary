@entity0 -- it may not have been the most dramatic of moments , but it was certainly an important one : two women , modestly dressed and veiled , walked proudly alongside the flag of their nation @entity6 into @entity0 's @entity7 at the @entity9 ' spectacular opening ceremony			1
this understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the @entity13 itself , as the first occasion in the history of the @entity9 when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams			1
the achievement was welcomed by those at the highest echelons of sport , with @entity23 , head of the @entity24 , noting with pride in his speech at the opening ceremony that it was " a major boost for gender equality			1
" women have been the center of attention throughout much of the @entity13 , both within and without @entity9 venues , as they broke records , sparked drama , impressed with immense skill and poise and won medal after medal			1
indeed , for many , @entity0 2012 has truly been " the women 's games			1
" for hosts @entity43 , the undoubted superstar was @entity46 , a heptathlete of remarkable talent and composure who snatched gold despite immense pressure and the unforgiving lens of modern celebrity			0
her comfortable win in the toughest of contests , and her vow to " keep exactly the same and the way i am " , sparked national praise and a call from women 's activists for more positive role models like her			1
scores of other , lesser - known women athletes marked firsts for their countries			0
@entity69 's @entity68 became her country 's first woman to win a medal in the games , saying afterward her medal was " for all the @entity69 people , for @entity69 women , for the new @entity69 "			2
games leave @entity0 with a golden glow women boxers made history by being included in the games for the first time , and the @entity84 's gymnastics team won a brace of medals for their remarkable performance			1
on the drama side , @entity89 fencer @entity88 found herself at the center of one of the most extraordinary moments of the games after the dying second of one match granted her rival the gold			0
the sight of her in floods of tears , refusing to leave the venue moved many , even if @entity13 authorities were unimpressed			2
but this is not to say there has not been controversy , in terms of sport , and plain , old fashioned sexism			0
eight women badminton players from @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity89 were disqualified for trying deliberately to lose matches in order to secure easier games			0
controversy over the disparate treatment of male and female athletes arose when it was revealed that both @entity123 and @entity124 had made their women 's football teams fly coach while their male colleagues enjoyed the luxury -- and extra leg room -- of business class			1
the incident prompted the embarrassed @entity124 authorities to announce they were reviewing their policies but led to accusations of inequality			0
@entity84 coverage of their " @entity140 " gymnastics team 's heroine , @entity138 , turned into a discussion of the @entity144 's hair , angering many who felt it denigrated her stunning achievement by playing into racial stereotypes			2
golden girl @entity150 : i 'd do it for nothing and the age - old double standard of looks versus talent came into play when @entity159 weightlifter @entity158 was forced to endure cruel taunts on @entity161 and other social media about her appearance			0
her response was to handle it with aplomb , writing on her blog : " we do n't lift weights in order to look hot , especially for the likes of men like that			0
" but the comments -- and the ease with which they were made on online platforms -- gave pause for thought			0
despite such media storms , overall many sensed a shift in the right direction , a sea change in attitudes towards women in competitive sports			0
in women 's football , @entity188 's victory over @entity189 at @entity190 in front of 70,000 screaming fans , many of them young children who will provide the next generation of olympians , was a zeitgeist moment for women 's football			1
after the game , the sight of buggies piled up outside the arena , patiently awaiting their tiny cargo , was a small , but potent sign of change			0
the @entity84 and @entity207 women 's football teams fought a remarkable battle to reach the semi finals , with the @entity84 eventually prevailing 4 - 3 thanks to a goal in the dying seconds of the game and prompting praise from pundits as one of the most thrilling matches played by either gender in the @entity13			1
as for those @entity6 women athletes , they failed , as expected , to win an @entity13 medal , but perhaps winning just was n't the point			1
judo player @entity221 finally competed after a row over her headscarf ended in compromise with @entity13 authorities			2
despite the furor , she , too , sensed that a breakthrough had been made			0
" unfortunately , we did not win a medal , but in the future we will and i will be a star for women 's participation , " she said			2
" it was the opportunity of a lifetime			2

@entity236 is the first olympics to feature women in every national team

@entity6 judoka @entity221 says taking part " opportunity of lifetime "
