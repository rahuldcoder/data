-- the lessons of the first round of the @entity4 presidential elections are multiple and somewhat contradictory			1
there is , on the one hand , the first - round victory of a self - described " normal man " who is still -- in spite of very tight results -- likely to become the next president of @entity4 : @entity13			1
his lack of charisma has not been a handicap , so great was the rejection of incumbent president @entity18			1
@entity13 's good - naturedness and his smiling personality evoke a mixture of @entity21 and even @entity22			1
one should not be deluded : any successful politician has a killer instinct			0
but his friendliness is reassuring after the hyper - energetic and aggressive personality of @entity18 , whose style was making people unnecessarily anxious			2
@entity13 has managed to turn the first round into a referendum against the personality and style of the incumbent			2
one might say @entity18 's behavior greatly encouraged him in this choice of strategy			1
the incumbent candidate would have done better campaigning on his success in dealing with an unprecedented economic crisis with determination and firmness			2
in 2007 , @entity18 campaigned on hope and modernity			2
in 2012 , he was the candidate of fear , appealing to the right - wing opponents of immigration			0
it was n't expected at all , but @entity4 participation was at a level that @entity53 dream about : more than 80 %			1
but this apparent triumph of democracy was somewhat tainted			0
nearly 20 % of the electorate voted for the @entity57 , the party of the extreme right			1
to add insult to injury , many young voters supported the party 's candidate , @entity62			2
youth is supposed to be synonymous with hope			0
with the rise of unemployment and the decline of belief in the value of the @entity72 , it seems young people , especially poorly educated ones , are motivated by fear much more than by hope			0
this rise of right - wing populism affecting mostly the young , which one witnesses from @entity78 to @entity4 , is of course the direct consequence of the economic , social -- if not ethical -- crisis that besets @entity83 once again			1
it would be excessive to speak of the return of the 1930s			0
those tragic years were the product of the encounter between the @entity89 of 1914 - 18 and the @entity90 of the late 1920s and early 1930s			0
we are not there and , we hope , will never again be there			0
nevertheless , in @entity4 , @entity18 has been playing with fire in his attempt to seduce extreme - right voices			1
as @entity98 would have said : " he will have dishonour first and then defeat			0
" at this point , only a miracle could save @entity18			2
in 2007 , modernity meant the call for structural reforms			0
in 2012 , modernity may be on @entity13 's side when he campaigns on fairness and the fight against social injustice			1
in this juncture in our global world , there is a need to restore a broken social contract resulting from too much inequality			2
it is a most modern issue that concerns the entire world , with the possible exception of @entity83			0
it affects the @entity53 as well as @entity119 , @entity120 or @entity121			0
sacrifices can only be acceptable if they seem to be equally shared by all segments of society			0
what would a @entity13 victory mean for @entity4 and for @entity83 ? the year 2012 is not 1981 , when the @entity127 came to power behind @entity129 for the first time in the history of the @entity132			1
the @entity133 is over ; the @entity134 are more " pale pink " than ever ; the rules of monetary union are much stricter than they ever were			0
the margin for maneuver in a sovereign state in @entity83 is extremely limited by law as much as by economic circumstances			2
@entity13 is a @entity143 ; he does not have the means to be a revolutionary			1
as for @entity83 , @entity13 in power in @entity4 would merely be an accelerating factor in the slow evolution of the @entity72 away from a strict austerity policy , which the @entity150 themselves have started to question			1
can a " normal man " be the right choice for exceptional times ? @entity155 in the @entity53 rose to the challenge			0
why not @entity13 in @entity4 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			1

@entity159 : the @entity4 *dislike* @entity18 , and @entity13 is sure to win the presidency
@entity13 is a @entity143 , but 20 % of the nation voted for the extreme right
@entity13 's success shows a need to address the economic inequality in @entity4 , he writes
@entity159 : @entity13 's success also signals *disaffection* with @entity172 austerity policies
