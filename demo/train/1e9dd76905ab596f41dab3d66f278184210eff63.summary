-- @entity1 overcame accusations of gamesmanship to beat his @entity5 teammate @entity4 and win a tense and at times dramatic @entity6			1
the @entity8 driver led from the start with early championship pace setter @entity4 , nursing an eye injury later in the race , having to make do with second place			1
@entity15 's @entity14 finished third			0
but the race , much like the build up , was dominated by tensions between the two @entity5 drivers			2
with @entity1 and @entity4 -- who were separated by just three championship points going in to the race -- vying for pole position on the final lap of qualifying saturday , @entity1 left the track after his front wheel locked			1
the stewards brought out caution flags , preventing @entity4 from completing his final qualifying lap and handing pole to @entity1			1
@entity1 claimed it was a simple error and a steward 's inquiry agreed , concluding that there was " no evidence of any offense			2
" but @entity4 was less convinced			0
" i found the time at the end and was n't able to execute it so it was n't a true showing of my true pace , " the @entity37 driver told the @entity38 after qualifying			0
" but i should have known that was going to happen and done it the lap before , " he added			0
despite @entity5 non-executive chairman @entity50 voicing fears that the two drivers may collide at the first corner , the front row got away without incident and @entity1 built a strong lead on a course renowned for its difficulty in overtaking			1
a stalemate followed until lap 28 when @entity61 's @entity60 crashed out , causing the safety car to come and provoking a flurry of tactical pit stops			0
thereafter @entity4 caught up with @entity1 , and looked set to challenge for the lead , until he suddenly dropped back , complaining to his team that he could n't see out of his left eye			2
in the end @entity4 was lucky to clinch second after @entity14 pulled close in the final laps			0
the result saw @entity1 take the lead in the drivers championship , with @entity4 dropping back to second			1
but with many making comparisons between the famously bitter team rivalry between @entity76 and @entity77 , the battle , and the mind games , are likely to continue until the last race of the season .			0
