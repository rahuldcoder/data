-- after launching her @entity2 residency last december with a series of sold - out dates , @entity6 , country music 's biggest - selling female artist of all time , is returning to @entity10 for another series of dates that kick off october 15th and run through mid-december			1
with the show entering its second year , @entity6 can turn her attention to her next album , her first since 2002 's " @entity16			1
" speaking to @entity18 from her longtime home of @entity20 , the superstar tells us she has most of the songs in place for the next record and is gearing up to find a producer and define the sound of the album			1
how is the album coming ? i 'm pretty much there with my songs , and i 'm really just sitting on the fence in regards to a producer			1
so i 'm listening to a lot of records , doing my homework there , and trying to determine who is the right match			1
are there people who stand out to you as you listen to records ? this is last year , but i 'm really stuck on @entity46			1
i 've been listening to that one a lot more and kind of stuck on the sound of that record			1
i really love " @entity50 " as well -- @entity51 and @entity52			2
so that goes to show you how lost i am as far as production direction , because i 'm listening to such a broad spectrum			1
both of those productions really appeal to me , and the direction that they took -- just trying to get ideas for myself			2
best albums of 2013 : @entity62 is there more internal pressure because it has been so long ? yeah , of course			0
i do want it to be perfect , and i want it to be something that i really enjoy and a product of my inspiration -- not a product of necessarily anything i 've done before or anyone i 've been before in regards to making records , because it 's been a long time			1
i 'm different , i 've evolved , and i want that to be reflected in the music			0
at the same time i do n't want to abandon the root of what i am			0
so it 's just really determining where am i really at and just looking through that			1
it 's not as obvious as it seems it should be			1
what are the songs that have really jumped out at you , and what can you tell us about the ones you have so far ? there are probably less upbeat songs			1
i would say it 's more half and half compared to what i would 've done in the past , where i would 've leaned more towards mostly uptempo songs			1
i still want to remain positive with my lyrics and stay in that mode with my music , because i enjoy uplifting myself , if you will , with my songs			1
but at the same time i 'm going deeper , and i 'm being more realistic with my point of view on things			0
it 's really such a personal journey making a record , but even more so writing the songs			1
and you feel a bit obsessed about them at this stage as well , i think , because until they get to a producer they 're still yours , at this stage where i 'm at now			0
so maybe letting go is going to be a little bit difficult , and i know that when i involve a producer that 's sort of what will happen to a degree			1
of course i 'll remain very involved , but i guess i 've just got to get out there and meet these producers face - to - face and talk through			1
i 've just got to get myself to that next stage			0
' @entity50 ' was produced by @entity127			0
i 'd love to see that collaboration , but there are so many good producers out there			1
there 's a lot of choice			1
it 's overwhelming , and it 's overwhelming trying to pinpoint who to go with on this project , because it will determine a lot of the direction , and i 'm committing myself			1
it 's that fear of committing myself once and for all and locking myself in			1
that 's what scares me the most , really			1
and i 've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around , changing my mind			2
and that 's part of the whole thing of being creative -- until you commit , you can change your mind and rewrite it and create a new melody and change the story			2
and at some point that 's got to end			2
and that is the point when you actually make the records			0
so letting go of that phase of it is probably my biggest hesitation			0
on the @entity164 : @entity165 edges out @entity166 any chance you 'll preview new material in @entity10 ? i think it 's too soon			2
i probably could start doing that , but i do n't want to get locked into a performance mode with a song , either , until i 've taken it a little further down the line			0
just talking it through , like we 're doing now , does help			0
and it gets me in that mindset			0
it 's probably the right time now to start taking it more seriously as far as getting into the studio , especially since i 'm finished producing the show			1
the show took well over a year to put together , so that was a production in itself , like making a record			1
you had to write the whole story -- literally wrote the show out like a script , worked through the production and had the technical side of it and eventually delivered it			2
so i 'm only recently freed up from going into one production and just getting geared up to go into another one , which should be the record			0
were there tours or performances that inspired you in creating this @entity10 show ? what we can do in that room i really would n't be able to do anywhere else -- certainly not tour with it , because the technology is so sophisticated you ca n't really move around with it			2
so the joy of having that high - end technology and taking advantage of that was a huge part of the excitement for me , and the margins where i can go and take it are just so broad in comparison to touring			0
so i wrote the show with all of that in mind , knowing i would have all this technology available -- this great room , the acoustics and this giant stage and everything like that			2
so i almost shot it more like a music video , all of my more iconic music videos or images , and based it from there			0
i wanted to bring those more alive , so i used that as the influence in regards to the fashion and the look of things			0
i want it to be familiar to people as well			0
i want them to reminisce , but i wanted them to see things in a more refreshed , contemporary way			0
then there was the fun part of picking the director and giving them all my ideas , my wish list , and asking them all , " which ones do you think you can realize , and how would you make them happen ? " and then the spine of the show was the song list			2
i want people to hear the songs they know			2
i want people to hear the hits and i want them to be satisfied in that regard			0
it always disappoints me when i go to a concert and they do n't play my favorite song , or at least one of their biggest hits			0
that process , for me , even without being the performer , was a fantastic experience , and really the big reason why i did n't plunge into the record right away			0
i needed that year just to write the show , to create it and build it			1
i know you 've seen a lot of shows of late as well			2
what blew you away ? @entity279 i 've seen a few times and he really inspired me , in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach			1
he 'll take an acoustic approach to them , he 'll rearrange them for the live stage			0
and i thought , " i really admire someone taking the license to do that , owning that			0
" i played around with that a little bit in the show as well , so that was an influence			2
i really admire artists that are willing to take a different approach and a different angle to their shows			0
so i did some of that			0
