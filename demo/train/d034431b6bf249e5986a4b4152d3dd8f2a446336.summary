-- success just keeps on coming for @entity2 , but the world 's no. 1 golfer is already targeting more			1
@entity2 became the first player since @entity6 in 2008 to win back - to - back majors sunday as he claimed the @entity8 just three weeks after getting his hands on the @entity10			1
the 25 - year - old battled back from a poor start to his final day at @entity13 to card a three - under - par 68 and finish one shot clear of second - placed @entity15			0
the victory -- the second time @entity2 has captured the @entity8 -- means he has now won three straight tournaments , having also triumphed at the @entity18 last week			1
the @entity19 , though , has already turned his attention to claiming a fifth major at the masters next year -- the only one missing from a career grand slam collection			1
after a disappointing 2013 , and then the breakup of his long - term relationship with tennis star @entity26 , @entity2 is now firmly focused on achieving his golfing goals			2
" i 've realized this year that we only have one go at this , we only have a certain time span as a career , " he said			0
" golf careers are typically longer than other sporting careers but there 's only a certain window , and every tournament you do n't win is a missed opportunity			0
" @entity40 was the scene of his final - day collapse in 2011 in which he dropped a four - shot lead to ultimately finish 10 strokes off the pace			2
" i did n't want to go to @entity40 next year having not won this , " @entity2 told @entity0 after sunday 's victory in near darkness after a weather delay			2
" i wanted to go to @entity40 with four major championships , and i want to go to @entity40 next year trying to win five and trying to win the career grand slam			1
" i 've refocused and i 've rededicated myself and this is important to me			0
this is my career and i want to make the most of it			0
" @entity2 will also be hoping to join an elite club by winning three consecutive majors			1
@entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 are the only professional golfers to have achieved such a feat , but @entity2 is confident he has what it takes to join the trio of golfing greats			0
" going to @entity40 next year , trying to complete the career grand slam for a start , and then trying to complete the third leg ( winning three straight majors ) -- i 'm going to go to @entity40 next year with a lot of expectation and a lot of hype , and one thing that i need to do is try to handle those , " he said			1
" i know @entity40 is a good course for me and i have to beat the same guys that i beat this week , and i have to try and beat the same guys that i try and beat week - in , week - out			0
" that gives me a lot confidence , knowing that i can handle this sort of pressure down the stretch of a major , and that gives me a lot of confidence going into @entity40 next year			0

@entity2 *thrilled* with @entity8 win
@entity2 already targeting success at 2015 masters
