-- just as it 's tough to ride 100 miles on my bike without a few good snack or stretch breaks along the way , today 's 24 - 7 " always on " world of work makes " switching off " even more vital than ever to maintain productivity , focus , and energy at work -- and to preserve some form of a life with friends , pets , spouses -- and yourself			1
the work marathons demanded by this challenging decade need programmatic , regular recharge respites if you 're in it for the long haul			1
having flunked retirement twice , i 'm addicted to my work , which i love -- even after 42 years of flat - out entrepreneurship , including these latest two exhausting and exhilarating years writing , publishing , and traveling to lecture about " @entity28 , " which i co-authored with customer development pioneer @entity29			1
as a 42 - year confessed workaholic captured by a nonstop stream of 200 - plus daily emails hitting multiple devices , i 've developed ( and stolen ) dozens of " turn off " tools and tricks to pull myself away from the info onslaught besieging millions of us worldwide			1
this " nonstopitis " disease affects entrepreneurs like me most of all , and i hope to cure the " disease " before i find myself too busy to attend my own funeral			2
see also : do n't let e-mail run your work life my favorite and newest trick decouples brain from electronic communication devices for a few hours at least once or more every single day -- a major life improvement -- just as many did in our parents ' generation , who decoupled simply by leaving the office in the ancient @entity57 era			1
another trick : simply ask yourself " will anything bad really happen between 5pm and 6am if i turn my back on my inboxes completely ? " to save your own life , create your own list of " tricks " and of rules to impose on yourself			1
some of mine that work : switch gears : when tired of " project a , " switch to something else on the list -- easier , different , faster - paced or ( gasp ) fun			2
changing rhythm is restorative and you return to the tougher project fresher in an amazingly short time			2
change chairs and media -- draft that important thing in ( gasp ) longhand in a club chair or on a sofa			2
i sequester all devices in my home office no later than 10pm each night , knowing that friends , daughter , and business partner all know my home phone " just in case			0
" but it helps make the day actually end ! all devices stay in the car when we visit or go out with friends			0
the break from each is immensely liberating			0
" no device " mealtimes are de rigeur for wife @entity96 and i , but we 're still working on liberating our daughter and her husband			0
a glass of wine at dinner ( not two ) slows me down just enough to return to the keyboard with fresh energy			0
a mid-afternoon cigar or swim			0
those 15 - 20 minutes change all the energy and clear the head , like pushing " restart " on a device			0
a 20 - minute exercise break , ideally coupled with a five - minute shower ( easiest for work ( at - home ) aholics )			1
see also : how to cope with too much work my business partner and co-author @entity29 , a workaholic @entity117 legend , imposed this discipline i recommend : " date night " with his wife @entity119			1
only rare and urgent business can keep them from their thursdays			0
there are few better power tools in my book than exercise in almost any form , especially something like bike riding or skiing -- my two personal favorites -- where it 's near impossible to focus on anything other than the cars or moguls whizzing by			2
gym workouts are almost as good , provided you " zone out " watching @entity0 or @entity137 reruns , rather than reading work - related stuff			1
speaking of reading , i forced myself to read a @entity142 thriller last week , and remembered why the genre is called " escape " fiction			0
onward to more such escapes			0
entrepreneurs consider 60 - 80 - hour workweeks their trademark , it seems			0
add 10 hours of breaks to the week to make the other 60 - plus more productive			2
before you toggle back to your inbox or another web page , make a list of three tricks that will work best for you and try them before the weekend			1
i guarantee it 'll enhance your productivity and encourage longer lists			0
