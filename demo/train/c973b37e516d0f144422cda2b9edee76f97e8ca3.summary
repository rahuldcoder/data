@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 failed to keep his 2008 election promise to close the @entity6 prison camp at a @entity3 naval base in @entity8 because the world had stopped watching			1
@entity11 , delighted at his election and pledge to abandon @entity14 - era torture practices that had sullied the @entity3 reputation worldwide , assumed that he would do what he said was going to do			1
it has taken three years to realise that he missed his self - imposed deadline			1
for many that realization has been brought about by the @entity6 detainees themselves , who unable to voice their despair in any other way are now on hunger strike in large numbers			1
even the @entity3 military now admits that more than 50 of the 166 detainees in the camp are now involved			1
in reality , the number is much higher : @entity30 understands , through unclassified phone calls with our clients , that more than 130 are now on hunger strike			1
these include men with close ties to @entity11 : @entity38 is a @entity0 , a @entity39 resident with a @entity39 wife and four @entity39 kids living in the capital			2
he has been cleared for release twice -- by both the @entity14 and @entity2 administrations			2
successive @entity39 governments have called for him to be returned home			0
yet he is still in @entity6 , more than a decade on from being taken into @entity3 custody			1
a fortnight ago , he told his lawyer , @entity30 's @entity48 , that he had joined the hunger strike and had already lost over 30 pounds in weight			1
" i ca n't read			0
i am dizzy and i fall down all the time , " he said , adding " my back and my neck are getting worse day by day			0
i do n't want the end of this torture here to be paralyzed			0
i want to carry my kids when i get home			0
" @entity60 's father and grandfather both fought for the @entity63 army			0
he longs to return to his family in @entity63 -- his uncle , @entity65 , has said : " i am asking @entity3 for humanity , and asking @entity63 for gratitude			2
" but so far @entity60 has had neither -- he has now lost so much weight that he is being force - fed by @entity6 personnel , strapped to a chair while a tube is pushed up his nose and down his throat -- an intensely painful process that has been described by the @entity76 as inhuman and degrading treatment			2
@entity60 has been cleared for release since 2007 -- yet over five years on from @entity3 authorities deciding that he is no threat to anyone , he still languishes in @entity6			1
on wednesday night on an unclassified call with his lawyer he told her he had " lost all hope of ever being released			0
" another detainee , @entity85 hopes one day to be reunited with his family in @entity86			0
he too has joined the hunger strike			1
on a recent unclassified call , he told @entity30 : " the nightmare has started again			0
for some time , things had got a bit better here ... but now it has changed again ... really , now it is just pain everywhere			0
i do n't want to die in @entity6			2
" like @entity38 and @entity60 , @entity85 has never been given a trial or charged with any crime , and has been cleared for release by the @entity3 authorities			2
there are many more in @entity6 like these men -- stuck in a limbo with no apparent end , adrift from even the most basic principles of the rule of law			0
the hope which rose on the election of president @entity2 , who promised to close @entity6 , now seems like a cruel joke			1
it is easy to understand the desperation they must feel : as @entity38 himself put it recently , " a little over 50 % of the prisoners have been told they can go home -- or go somewhere -- but [ they ] are still here			0
" on thursday the @entity114 tabled an urgent hearing on the hunger strike in @entity6			1
it is crucial that @entity11 realises that this is not just a @entity3 issue -- it is our problem as well			1
@entity11 intelligence services worked closely with the @entity3 in implementing the misguided policies of the so - called " @entity125 " that saw so many innocent men swept up , " rendered " and tortured , simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time			1
@entity11 has tolerated for too long the @entity3 departure from the rule of law with regard to people who deserve the support of @entity11 governments			2
it must be hoped that this debate is a first step towards remedying this			0
there is much to welcome in the motion : a call for @entity11 to re-engage , to demand the closure of @entity6 , and , crucially , to offer to resettle the dozen or so prisoners who have been cleared for release but can not go home because of the risk of torture			2
if @entity11 follows through on this , there will still be hope that one day soon , men like @entity38 , @entity60 and @entity154 will be reunited with their families			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			0
