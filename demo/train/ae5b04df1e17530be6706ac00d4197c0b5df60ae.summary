@entity0 -- last - minute jostling in @entity5 's @entity4 race has given sudden life to long - stalled legislation to authorize the @entity8			1
both houses of @entity10 are on track to vote in the coming days on proposals sponsored by the candidates who will face off in a december @entity4 runoff in @entity5			2
the @entity15 has scheduled a vote for friday on a bill to green - light the $ 8 billion project to transport oil from @entity21 to the @entity22			1
the @entity4 , meanwhile , is likely to vote early next week on similar legislation			1
the moves could force the hand of president @entity26 , who has said he wo n't make a decision on whether to allow the pipeline to go forward until the @entity29 can finish a years - long independent review			1
@entity15 press secretary @entity31 told reporters traveling with the president during an @entity35 trip on thursday that the administration takes " a dim view of these kinds of proposals , " suggesting a veto is possible			1
the pipeline has become a political football in @entity5 , which is holding a dec. 6 run - off election for its @entity4 seat			1
@entity46 incumbent @entity45 is trying to demonstrate her clout as @entity49 chairwoman one last time by prodding the chamber to vote on legislation authorizing the pipeline			0
she said repeatedly that at least 60 senators would vote for her bill			0
" i am so pleased to have been one of the spark plugs to help to get us moving -- not in the next @entity10 , but in the lame duck session of this @entity10 , " @entity45 said on the @entity4 floor thursday			0
@entity15 @entity59 countered by scheduling a vote on their own on the same bill -- this one sponsored by rep. @entity62 , @entity45 's @entity59 challenger			2
combined with @entity4 @entity59 ' pledge to place @entity62 on the energy panel , it 's an effort to mute @entity45 's claims of influence on energy issues that are important in oil - rich @entity5			2
" regardless of the reason , what we 're doing here today is working together on ideas that we 've been trying to push for a long , long time , " @entity59 rep. @entity69 of @entity70 said on the @entity15 floor thursday			0
" now that the @entity4 is here to join us , we are here to work together , " sessions said while repeatedly pointing out that @entity62 is sponsoring the measure			0
@entity45 was aided in the @entity4 by @entity80 democrat @entity79 , who acknowledged that @entity45 " is in a fight for her life here " but said she 'd be willing to take her name off the bill if doing so would ease its passage			2
" the best politics is good government , " he said			0
" if you do something good , as a @entity59 , as a @entity79 , we all get credit for it			0
" it 's not clear whether @entity10 actually has the authority to approve the project -- or whether that power lies solely with the @entity29 , which has jurisdiction because the pipeline would cross international borders			2
the legislation would use a january 2014 @entity29 environmental analysis of the project to satisfy requirements that it be studied for adverse effects			0
@entity108 law professor @entity107 said the legislation the @entity15 and @entity4 are set to vote on " would override the presidential permit process and simply declare the proposal to be approved as a matter of federal law			1
" he said there likely are n't enough votes to overturn an @entity26 veto -- especially with @entity46 still holding a @entity4 majority before new lawmakers are sworn in early next year			1
" nonetheless , this is the most substantial shift in momentum with respect to the @entity8 project that has occurred in the last several years , " he said .			0

the @entity15 could vote to approve the @entity8 on friday , followed by the @entity4 next week
efforts to boost the two candidates in the @entity4 run - off election have propelled the legislation
it 's not clear whether president @entity26 would veto a bill that takes the decision out of the @entity29 's hands
