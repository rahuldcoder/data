@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 soldier went on a house - to - house shooting spree in two villages in southern @entity1 early sunday , @entity1 officials said , killing 16 people in what @entity1 's president called an " unforgivable " crime			1
@entity13 's @entity12 said the soldier acted alone and turned himself in after opening fire on civilians			1
@entity4 president @entity18 called the killings " tragic and shocking , " and offered his condolences to the @entity1 people in a phone call to his counterpart in @entity0 , @entity23 , the @entity17 said			1
but the attack is likely to further more anger at international forces following deadly riots over the burning of @entity29 by @entity4 troops			2
" the @entity1 people can withstand a lot of pain , " prince @entity31 , the head of the @entity32 with the @entity33 , told @entity2			1
" they can withstand collateral damage			0
they can withstand night raids			0
but murder is something that they totally abhor , and when that happens , they really want justice			0
" in a statement issued by his office , @entity23 said the killings took place in the district of @entity50 , about 25 km ( 15 miles ) southwest of @entity51 , southern @entity1 's major city			1
haji @entity53 , a member of the provincial council , told @entity2 the soldier had attacked four houses in two nearby villages			2
" we call this an intentional act , " @entity23 said			1
he said the dead included four men , three women and nine children , calling the killings " acts of terror and unforgivable			2
" another five people were wounded , he said			0
capt. @entity69 , an @entity12 spokesman , said the wounded @entity1 were being treated in @entity12 facilities			1
the allied command did not give its own estimate of casualties			0
@entity69 said officials do not yet have a motive for the shooting , which is under investigation by both @entity13 and @entity1 officials			1
and maj. @entity79 , another @entity12 spokesman , said the soldier " was acting on his own			1
" there were no military operations in the area , either on the ground or in the air , at the time , according to two senior @entity12 officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation			1
they said only one soldier , an @entity93 staff sergeant , is believed to have been involved			0
a @entity4 military official told @entity2 later sunday that the suspect is from @entity96 in @entity97			1
the official said the soldier is assigned to a @entity101 unit			2
a third @entity12 official said @entity1 troops spotted the soldier leaving his combat outpost around 3 a.m. sunday and notified their @entity4 counterparts			1
the @entity4 military did an immediate headcount , found the soldier was missing and dispatched a patrol to go look for him , the official said			1
the officials said they have no knowledge at this point whether he had any previous medical or mental health issues in his record			0
the patrol met him as he returned and took him into custody			0
he said nothing , and it was unclear whether they knew what had happened , the official said			0
" we do n't know what motivated this individual , and we 're not sure where this is going to take us , " capt. @entity127 , an @entity12 spokesman , told @entity2			2
but he said @entity12 's commander , gen. @entity135 , " has made it clear this investigation is going to be thorough			2
it 's going to be done rapidly , in an expeditious way , and we 're going to hold the perpetrator of these attacks to account			0
" the news brought a wave of condemnations from top @entity4 officials			0
in a statement issued by the @entity17 , @entity18 said the @entity4 military will " get the facts as quickly as possible and to hold accountable anyone responsible			1
" @entity17 response to shooting spree " i am deeply saddened by the reported killing and wounding of @entity1 civilians			2
i offer my condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives , and to the people of @entity1 , who have endured too much violence and suffering , " @entity18 said			1
" this incident is tragic and shocking , and does not represent the exceptional character of our military and the respect that the @entity4 has for the people of @entity1			1
" in a separate statement , defense secretary @entity165 said he was " shocked and saddened " by the attack and said the suspect was " clearly acting outside his chain of command			0
" @entity135 called the killings " deeply appalling , " and acting @entity4 ambassador @entity172 said his country was " saddened by this violent act against our @entity1 friends			1
" " we deplore any attack by a member of the @entity184 against innocent civilians , " he said in a video statement , assuring " the people of @entity1 that the individual or individuals responsible for this terrible act will be identified and brought to justice			1
" but @entity31 , a member of @entity1 's former royal family , said the killings are likely to play into the hands of the @entity189 , the @entity190 fundamentalist movement that has battled the @entity4 - led coalition for a decade			1
" they are really going to milk this for all it 's worth , " @entity31 said , adding , " this is playing right into their program of psychological warfare against the @entity1 people			2
" the @entity189 has already said that the deaths were the result of a night raid by several soldiers and put the death toll at 50 , but it regularly exaggerates casualty figures			0
@entity31 called for a joint @entity4 - @entity1 investigation into the killings , saying @entity1 will want to see " quick and decisive justice			1
" " we can not whitewash this and get this young man out of @entity1 and send him back to the @entity4			2
that is the worst thing we can do at this time , " he said			0
and he questioned how the soldier left his post in the pre-dawn hours , adding , " i know the @entity51 base			0
a fly can not get in without being searched			0
" @entity51 and the surrounding region is the home of the @entity189 , and eight of the 69 coalition troops killed in @entity1 so far this year died in the province			1
but @entity127 said the area has been " a big success story " for the allied campaign , and he said @entity135 has made clear that the coalition strategy wo n't be affected by sunday 's killings			0
" as tragic as this incident is , it would be a larger tragedy to affect the mission at large and what we 're trying to do for the country , " he said			0
" we 're going to continue to be out there among the populace , " he added			0
" we 're going to continue to try to beat back this insurgency			0
" @entity189 link attack to @entity238 burning the @entity4 and its allies invaded @entity1 in 2001 , following @entity241 's terrorist attacks on @entity242 and @entity97 that killed nearly 3,000 people			1
the invasion quickly toppled the @entity189 , which ruled most of @entity1 and had allowed @entity241 to operate from its territory			2
but the militia soon regrouped and launched an insurgent campaign against the allied forces and a new government led by @entity23			2
the no. 1 @entity4 target in the conflict , @entity241 founder @entity253 , was killed in a commando raid in neighboring @entity255 in may 2011			0
@entity4 and allied combat troops are scheduled to leave @entity1 by 2014 , and @entity23 has been increasingly critical of the allied force			1
tensions ramped up dramatically in february , after a group of @entity4 soldiers burned copies of the @entity238 , @entity190 's holy book , that had been seized from inmates at the @entity4 - run prison at @entity264			0
@entity4 officials from @entity18 down called the burning an accident and apologized for it , but riots left dozens dead , including six @entity4 troops			1
hundreds more @entity1 were wounded			2
the war has cost the lives of nearly 1,900 @entity4 and just under 1,000 more allied troops to date			0
@entity2 's @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0
