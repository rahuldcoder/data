the number of new @entity3 cases reported in the three worst - hit countries fell to its lowest level since late june , the @entity0 said thursday			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 had a combined total of 99 new cases for the week ending january 25 , the @entity0 said			1
the total breaks down to 65 in @entity9 , 30 in @entity7 and four in @entity8			1
the number of cases continued to fall in @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity0 said , but @entity7 's figure rose from 20 confirmed cases in the previous week			1
the western district of @entity18 -- where the local community has shown high levels of resistance to measures to limit the disease 's spread -- was the worst - affected in @entity7 , with half the new cases for the week , the report said			1
the response to the @entity3 epidemic has now moved to a second phase , @entity0 said , " as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic			2
" to achieve this goal as quickly as possible , efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding , case management , safe burials , and community engagement is used as effectively as possible			0
" there have been more than 22,000 reported confirmed , probable , and suspected cases since the outbreak began , with almost 8,800 known deaths			2
according to the latest @entity0 report , children are less susceptible than adults to contracting the virus , which spreads through direct contact with an infected person 's bodily fluids			2
people aged 15 to 44 are approximately three times more likely to be affected than children aged up to 14 , while adults aged 45 and older are almost four times more likely to be affected than are children			0
even as the number of cases drops , scientists around the world continue to study the virus in a bid to understand how it works and help develop more effective vaccines against it			1
dr. @entity63 , human geneticist at the @entity64 in @entity65 , is part of a team working to sequence the virus and monitor how it mutates			0
" it 's very important for us to follow what happens with the virus sequence , " he told @entity5			0
while the virus is not that mutated yet , he said , " it 's important for us to monitor how it changes and see whether it is more contagious or more lethal			0
" his team is using samples from blood collected from @entity7 and processed by colleagues based in @entity83 , @entity84 , who 've been working on the @entity3 project since april last year			1
@entity63 's team has sequenced about 20 samples so far and hopes to do another 100 in the coming weeks , ultimately sequencing several hundred			2
many people 's fears have focused on whether the virus could change to become airborne , but it does n't appear to be easy for it to mutate sufficiently to alter the mode of transmission , he said			0
@entity63 said it was normal for the virus to change and that it 's " not something to be frightened of at the moment			0
" @entity5 's @entity101 contributed to this report .			0
