" i have witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by the @entity5 , and this will help end @entity17 's heinous acts that have created a human rights crisis in @entity3			1
we must work to bring justice to the children and victims in @entity6 devastated by @entity17 and the @entity5			2
i have been fervently involved in trying to prevent further abductions and murders of @entity6 children , and today 's action offers hope that the end of the @entity5 is in sight			2

" each day that goes by without a solution to the problem of the @entity5 is another day of terror and pain for those of us living under constant threat of renewed attacks			1
already , the @entity5 has brutally killed more than 2,300 of our family members and abducted over 3,000 others since they began their latest wave of killings in september 2008 , " the letter said			2
" many of our children are still in the hands of the @entity5			0
we do not know if they are alive or dead			0
those who have managed to escape the @entity5 bear the physical and mental scars of what they have suffered and will never be the same again			0
we have few means to help them readjust and integrate back into our communities , but we are trying to do what we can			0
" the letter cites massacres in 2008 and 2009			0
" during these attacks , our family members were killed in unimaginably savage ways : their heads crushed with clubs or machetes ; their faces disfigured ; and their genitals , mouths , ears , legs and arms cut off , for no reason other than to terrorize			0
