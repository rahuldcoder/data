the @entity1 's commissioner came down hard tuesday on @entity3 owner @entity2 , ordering him out of his team 's business and pushing to force him to sell over racist remarks that caused a firestorm since becoming public days ago			1
@entity8 detailed @entity2 's punishment of a lifetime ban and $ 2.5 million fine -- the " maximum amount " allowed per league guidelines -- at a press conference eight hours before @entity2 's @entity3 were to tip off in the fifth game of a tightly contested first - round playoff series with the @entity17			1
silver 's decision was met with immediate support from @entity1 owners , players and others connected to the league who have been calling for swift , firm punishment ever since @entity27 posted audio featuring the incendiary comments			1
" i hope that every bigot in this country sees what happened to mr. @entity2 and recognizes that if he can fall , so can you , " @entity35 mayor @entity34 , a former @entity1 all - star who was tasked with leading the @entity1 players union 's efforts on this matter			1
@entity40 scandal : @entity8 's moment to shine under the lifetime ban , @entity2 is prohibited from attending @entity1 games or practices , stepping foot inside any @entity3 ' facility , taking part in business or personnel decisions , or having a role in league activities such as attending @entity1 board of governors meetings			1
silver -- who succeeded longtime @entity1 leader @entity55 in february -- also insisted he will do " everything in my power " to compel the @entity1 board of governors to " force a sale " of the @entity3			1
the commissioner said " i fully expect " to get the needed three - quarters of the league 's owners -- meaning at least 23 -- to back the move , though @entity2 could fight any such move in court			1
if @entity40 does sell the team , he stands to profit considerably : he bought the @entity3 for $ 12 million in 1981 , and the team is now worth $ 575 million , according to @entity68			1
and he 'd likely have plenty of suitors : among them is @entity73 mogul @entity72 , who spokeswoman @entity74 says is " interested " in buying the team			0
rather than water cooler discussions of exciting @entity1 playoff action , people are talking about racist remarks by a team owner , said @entity82 , head of @entity84 's sports law program			1
estimating the team may be worth closer to $ 1 billion , @entity82 added , " he may get a lot of money from the sale , but i think it will allow the @entity1 to shift their focus			1
" what ban means for @entity94 finances that 's what @entity3 coach @entity96 said tuesday night , commending @entity8 as " fantastic " for making " a decision that really was the right one			1
" while the players are n't rejoicing , they are breathing easier knowing what happened earlier in the day , he said			0
" they were just happy that it was a resolution , " @entity96 said , expressing hope that playing the game will be a " safe haven " for all involved			0
" ... we 're all in a better place because of this			0
" @entity3 : ' now the healing process begins ' the inflammatory sentiments @entity8 referred to came packaged in a 10 - minute recording that @entity27 said occurred during an april 9 conversation between @entity40 and girlfriend @entity115			1
on the recording , a man and woman argue about photos posted to @entity120 in which she appears with african - americans			0
the man says he does n't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her			0
the sports website @entity128 on sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording			0
neither website has said how it obtained the recordings ; @entity115 's lawyer 's office said sunday that she did n't release them to @entity27 , while stating they are legitimate			2
on saturday , @entity3 president @entity137 suggested the audio was aimed at " getting even " with @entity2 over a lawsuit			1
@entity140 filed a lawsuit last month against @entity115 , who she said was having an affair with her husband and accusing @entity115 of going after extremely wealthy older men			0
@entity137 said that the offensive comments are " not consistent with , nor does it reflect ( @entity2 's ) views , beliefs or feelings			2
" moreover , he cast doubt as to whether @entity2 had made them , stating : " we do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered			2
" @entity8 expressed no such doubts tuesday , saying the @entity3 owner " acknowledged it was his voice on the tape			1
" asked whether the owner expressed any remorse , the commissioner said , " mr. @entity2 has not expressed those views directly to me			2
" moments after @entity8 's press conference concluded , the @entity3 struck a different tone			2
" we wholeheartedly support and embrace the decision by the @entity1 and commissioner @entity8 today , " the team said			1
" now the healing process begins			0
" @entity8 says he shares sponsors ' ' outrage ' there is no question that @entity40 rightfully owns the @entity3			1
some observers question how comments , made privately , could serve as grounds for such punishment , including possibly forcing him to sell the team			2
yet while there 's no precedent in the @entity1 , there is in other sports			2
in the 1990s , @entity182 repeatedly suspended @entity184 owner @entity183 over racist and other controversial comments , and she ultimately sold the franchise			2
@entity8 said tuesday he 'd " let the lawyers " address specifics , while stating flatly , " we have the authority to act as i 've recommended			2
" @entity82 said some owners might be wary of setting a precedent in which anyone can be voted out " just based on something they do n't like , whether it was said privately or just said publicly			0
" that view notwithstanding , @entity1 owners universally backed @entity8 's judgment in statements tuesday			1
if the owners follow through on the commissioner 's recommendation to force him to sell , @entity2 could fight back in the courts			1
but should he file a lawsuit , @entity205 senior legal analyst @entity204 says his chances of success seem " basically zero			0
" @entity2 so far has n't had found support in the court of public opinion , especially among past and present players			2
members of his own team , the @entity3 , debated boycotting their playoff game saturday with the @entity17 , according to coach rivers			1
they decided against it , instead opting to stage a silent protest by removing their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red t - shirts worn inside out , with the logos hidden			0
@entity8 said he talked to @entity225 point guard @entity224 ( who is also the players union president ) and other players prior to reaching his decision tuesday morning			1
dollars talked , too , to ramp up the pressure for @entity8 to act			2
over a dozen companies -- including @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 -- halted their sponsorships with the @entity3 over the remarks , @entity231 reported			2
speaking tuesday , the commissioner said he shares these companies " outrage , " adding " it will take some time " to get things right			0
@entity3 sponsors jump ship " i can understand how upset they are , and i 'll do my best to bring them back into the @entity1 family , " @entity8 said			1
for some , his decision to ban @entity2 was enough			2
both @entity248 and @entity249 announced later tuesday that they had renewed their " partnerships " in the wake of the owner 's public punishment			0
warriors coach @entity254 , who a day earlier urged fans to boycott tuesday 's game and said there was " a real discussion among the players " to do the same so long as @entity2 remained in charge , thinks @entity8 gave everyone enough reason now to come out to a game			1
" i thought he was absolutely incredible ... with the way that he took control of the moment , " @entity254 said of the commissioner before his team 's playoff showdown in @entity268			0
" ... it was exactly what the doctor ordered			0
" five key players in the @entity2 uproar @entity277 : players are ' very happy and satisfied ' one man thrust into the controversy -- seemingly out of the blue -- was @entity1 great @entity277			1
in the @entity27 recording , the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to @entity120 with @entity34			0
" in your lousy f * * ing @entity288 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " the man says			0
" if it 's white people , it 's ok ? " she responds			0
" if it was @entity297 , would it make a difference ? " @entity297 was @entity34 's chief rival when @entity297 's @entity299 and @entity34 's @entity300 ruled the @entity1			0
" i 've known ( @entity277 ) well , and he should be admired			0
... i 'm just saying that it 's too bad you ca n't admire him privately , " the man on the recording says			0
" admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity307 ) on an @entity120 for the world to have to see so they have to call me			0
and do n't bring him to my games			0
" after the audio went public , @entity34 -- who , since retiring from basketball , has become a successful businessman and part owner of baseball 's @entity314 -- expressed dismay and insisted he 'd never attend a @entity3 game so long as @entity2 was the owner			1
@entity34 offered a very different tune tuesday , commending @entity8 for exhibiting " great leadership " in saying he and others " are very happy and satisfied			0
" " i wish i was in @entity268 , i would be at the @entity94 game tonight ! " he tweeted			0
@entity2 has history of fighting discrimination claims in court will the @entity1 make @entity40 the first owner to give up team ? reaction : ' disturbing and offensive '			1

@entity17 coach : players talked of boycott prior to @entity40 decision
@entity1 bans @entity3 owner @entity2 for life , fines him $ 2.5 million for racist remarks
@entity2 admitted making *reviled* comments first heard on @entity27 , the @entity1 commissioner says
