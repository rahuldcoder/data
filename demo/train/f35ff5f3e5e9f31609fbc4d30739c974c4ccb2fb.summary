-- the @entity2 general who oversaw the withdrawal of @entity2 troops from @entity5 returned home tuesday with the flag that flew over @entity8 at the end of the war			1
president @entity11 and vice president @entity12 joined military leaders at the military 's @entity14 outside @entity16 as @entity18 gen. @entity17 returned the @entity20 command flag			2
the ceremony marks the formal conclusion of the conflict			0
" today , we bring home the colors to @entity2 soil , " the chairman of the @entity25 , gen. @entity26 , said during tuesday 's commemoration			1
" at the same time , we embrace many of our own back into the fold just in time for the holidays			0
" neither @entity11 nor @entity12 spoke at tuesday 's ceremony			1
the last @entity2 convoy left @entity5 early sunday , bringing an end to a nearly nine - year war that sharply divided the @entity2 public			1
nearly 4,500 @entity2 troops died and more than 30,000 were wounded in the conflict , while estimates of the @entity5 toll run well above 100,000 dead			1
" we lack the words to say what you feel on this day because , try as we may , we can never fully know it , " deputy defense secretary @entity43 told the families of those killed or wounded			0
" but we do know what your sacrifice means to us , to this nation and to a world that still depends so much on @entity2 for its security			0
" the standard that @entity17 presented in tuesday 's ceremony was the flag that was sheathed last week in a formal " casing of the colors " in @entity8			1
he said @entity2 troops , many of whom served multiple tours in @entity5 , have achieved " truly remarkable " things			1
" together with our coalition partners and corps of dedicated civilians , they removed a brutal dictator and gave the @entity5 people their freedom , " @entity17 said			2
" their courage and their ability to adapt has enabled us to persevere through the darkest days of the insurgency , to create hope and to provide the @entity5 opportunities that they have not seen in their lifetime			0
and so now the stage has been set for @entity5 's young democracy to emerge as a leader in what has been and what will continue to be a very dynamic region			2
" @entity2 and allied troops , mostly @entity84 , invaded @entity5 in march 2003 after accusing then - dictator @entity85 of concealing banned stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb			1
@entity85 's government quickly collapsed , but @entity2 inspectors later found that @entity5 had dismantled its weapons programs under @entity95 sanctions in the 1990s			1
the @entity2 occupation quickly found itself battling an insurgency launched by the remnants of @entity85 's regime			2
the @entity2 also faced @entity101 jihadists loyal to an @entity5 - based offshoot of @entity103 and @entity105 militias that @entity2 commanders said were backed by neighboring @entity107			2
@entity5 elected a new government in 2005 , and @entity85 was hanged in 2006			0
but soon afterward , sectarian warfare between @entity5 's @entity105 @entity111 majority and @entity113 minority erupted after the bombing of the @entity116 mosque , with thousands of bodies dumped in the streets of @entity8 and other cities for months			0
that fighting subsided in 2007 , after @entity16 poured about 30,000 more troops into @entity5 and began supporting @entity113 @entity111 groups that turned against the jihadists			0
the new @entity5 finds itself facing a political crisis within days of the @entity2 pullout , as prime minister @entity127 's @entity105 - dominated government accused the country 's leading @entity113 official of orchestrating bomb attacks against government and security officials			1
the powerful political bloc that draws support largely from @entity113 and more secular @entity5 has announced it is boycotting @entity135 , and its leaders accuse @entity127 of trying to amass dictatorial power			0
@entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
