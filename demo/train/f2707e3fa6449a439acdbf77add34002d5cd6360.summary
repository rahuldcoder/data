because being a gamer has grown from someone playing for hours on a console to include people who may play only for short periods on a smartphone or tablet , designers and developers are scrambling to meet changing demands			1

targeting core gamers if @entity54 and @entity56 want to capture gaming on the move , other companies want to appeal to gamers who want to stay inside			2
these companies recognize that mobile and social gaming are growing , but that does n't stop them from pitching their games at core gamers			2
