for a long time , rats have taken the heat for the waves of plague that killed millions of people across @entity6 starting in the 14th century			1
but now suspicion is falling on another rodent with a much cuddlier reputation : the gerbil			0
a team of scientists from @entity12 and @entity13 are challenging the widely held view that communities of rats in @entity6 played host to the fleas carrying the disease for hundreds of years			1
in an article published this week in the @entity22 , the researchers say they think the plague bacteria could have sprung from populations of the great gerbil and other rodent species in @entity27			2
" if we 're right , we 'll have to rewrite that part of history , " professor @entity28 of the @entity29 , one of the authors of the study , told the @entity33			0
the scientists investigated @entity6 's second plague pandemic , which began with the infamous @entity38 from 1347 to 1353 and continued on and off for four centuries			2
they say pinning the blame solely on rats does n't make sense			0
rats were n't found in large areas of northern @entity6 during the period , and the peaks of the plague outbreaks do n't correspond well with the climate conditions that suit rapid spreading of the disease by rat fleas			1
instead , by analyzing climate data gleaned from tree rings , they found clues that suggest the plague might have repeatedly been carried back into @entity6 from outbreaks among rodents in @entity27			1
" we show that wherever there were good conditions for gerbils and fleas in @entity27 , some years later the bacteria shows up in harbor cities in @entity6 and then spreads across the continent , " @entity28 told the @entity33			1
the scientists say they think it 's possible the plague was reintroduced each time by the trading networks of the era			2
caravans of traders and their camels that traveled through infested areas in @entity27 could have picked up the disease and sent it along trade routes reaching into @entity6			1
to determine whether they 're right , the researchers plan to analyze ancient plague dna taken from victims of the pandemic			0
but if rats are hoping the scientists ' theory will get them off the hook entirely , they should think again			0
the study says they could still have played a part in the spread of plague by ships			2
and for people suddenly worried about their pet gerbil , there 's no cause for alarm			0
" if you get your gerbil at a pet store ... you have nothing to worry about , " @entity96 , a plague expert for the @entity97 , told @entity98 .			0

rats have long been blamed for *helping* spread the plague in @entity6
but scientists say gerbils in @entity27 could have played a bigger role
they think the disease may have been repeatedly reintroduced through trade routes
