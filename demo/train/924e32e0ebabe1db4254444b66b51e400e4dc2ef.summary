-- a pair of gaffes by vice president @entity3 and @entity5 @entity4 illustrate just how hard it is to explain how vast the gaps of income and wealth in @entity10 have become -- including the significant but seldom - discussed difference between being merely rich and being super-rich			1
when @entity3 recently told an audience -- inaccurately , it turned out -- " i do n't own a single stock or bond ... i have no savings accounts , " he was widely seen as responding to earlier comments by @entity18 that she and her multimillionaire husband , ex-president @entity18 , would not be seen by voters as part of the economic elite who crashed the economy because " we pay ordinary income tax , unlike a lot of people who are truly well off			1
" both statements were widely seen as hopelessly off - key and out of touch , especially coming from politicians whose not - so - secret hopes for a shot at running for president in 2016 depend on connecting with average @entity10			1
if they expect to make it through the coming campaign without further ridicule , @entity3 and @entity18 will have to figure out a better way to discuss -- or not discuss -- their personal finances			2
let 's start with a reality check			0
@entity3 and his wife do , indeed , own multiple savings and stock accounts , but most have less than $ 15,000 in them			2
that makes @entity3 relatively poor , compared with his former colleagues in the @entity52 , whose average wealth is nearly $ 1 million			1
but the vice president is much better off than the typical @entity10 family , which has a savings account balance of only $ 3,800			1
more than half of all @entity10 own no stock at all , and only one - third have stock accounts worth more than $ 5,000			1
@entity18 suffers a similar problem of perspective			0
it 's true that she and her husband ended the @entity18 presidency facing $ 5 million in legal bills and no place to live ( they 'd spent more than a decade living in the @entity72 governor 's mansion and then the @entity73 )			0
but @entity4 's $ 8 million advance for her autobiography instantly moved the family into the 1 % , and both she and her husband can command $ 200,000 per speech			1
@entity18 's net worth is estimated at $ 55 million			0
even with all that wealth , @entity18 's underlying point -- that she and @entity18 earn their money and pay taxes on it every year -- is valid			2
the rarified company the former first couple keeps put them in touch with the super-rich -- heirs to great fortunes and owners of vast companies who do n't need to write books or give speeches to rake in their millions			0
it 's the difference between life in the top 1 % -- which requires household earnings of about $ 394,000 a year -- and the top .01 % , where the money zooms into the stratosphere and , more important , comes mostly from stocks and other investments rather than work			2
when merely rich people like @entity3 and @entity18 look around within the 1 % , they ca n't help but notice -- perhaps with a touch of envy -- that the top 0.1 % crowd is living a very different lifestyle			0
it 's one thing to fly first class ( or even @entity116 ) and quite another to pal around with people who command their own personal fleets of private jets			0
but if @entity3 and @entity18 are serious about a 2016 foray into the vote - getting business , they must suppress the very real urge to present themselves as " just plain folks " in a country where they are , by any measure , among the most fortunate			1
according to @entity131 figures , half of all @entity10 households earn less than $ 53,000 a year			1
those voters are n't likely to extend much sympathy to a vice president crying the blues about saving nothing while earning a federal salary of $ 233,000 a year or an @entity139 member , ex-senator who commands $ 200,000 per speech			0
the surest cure for seeming out of touch is to hit the campaign trail , with its endless string of town hall meetings and county fairs , its trips to diners , bowling alleys and factories during shift changes			0
it will take @entity3 and @entity18 back to their own working - class roots , and remind them what real economic struggle looks like .			0

@entity159 : @entity3 , @entity4 gaffes show how wide @entity10 's wealth gap has become
he says if they want to be president , they should find less tone - deaf way to discuss money
louis : both may feel poorer than super-rich they know , but median @entity10 income is $ 53,000
louis : they **'re** not " just plain folks , " they **'re** among country 's most fortunate ; should own it
