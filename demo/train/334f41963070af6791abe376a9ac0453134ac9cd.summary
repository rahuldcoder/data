@entity25 , 55 , of @entity17 , was sentenced wednesday after he pleaded guilty in september to conspiracy to commit bank robbery and using a destructive device during a crime of violence			2
prosecutors said @entity25 and three co-conspirators -- one of whom was pizza deliveryman @entity15 -- planned to rob a @entity35 on the outskirts of @entity17 , and @entity15 , 46 , carried out the robbery on august 28 , 2003			1
