@entity0 -- @entity2 has apologized for a " grotesque , offensive " cartoon of @entity5 prime minister @entity4 published in @entity7 's @entity6			1
the cartoon by @entity9 depicts @entity4 atop an incomplete brick wall with screaming @entity11 and body parts in the mortar			1
@entity4 is holding what appears to be a bloody builder 's trowel and the wall 's mortar is colored red			1
the wording beneath reads : " @entity5 elections , will cementing @entity21 ? " the cartoon was published on @entity23 on sunday and prompted complaints that it was anti-semitic and insensitive			1
@entity2 , chairman of @entity26 , which owns the @entity6 , used his @entity28 feed to apologize , tweeting : " @entity9 has never reflected the opinions of the @entity6			1
nevertheless , we owe major apology for grotesque , offensive cartoon			2
" @entity9 , who has worked for the @entity6 since 1967 , is perhaps best - known for designing and directing the animation for the film of @entity36 's @entity35			2
@entity37 , the acting editor of the @entity6 , also apologized , saying in a statement : " the last thing i or anyone connected with the @entity6 would countenance would be insulting the memory of the @entity42 [ @entity23 ] or invoking the blood libel			1
" the paper has long written strongly in defense of @entity5 and its security concerns , as have i as a columnist			0
we are however reminded of the sensitivities in this area by the reaction to the cartoon and i will of course bear them very carefully in mind in future			0
" the weekday edition of @entity57 reported tuesday that @entity37 would meet representatives of the @entity60 community to apologize			0
in a statement posted on his website , @entity9 said : " first of all i am not , and never have been , anti-semitic			0
the @entity6 has given me the freedom of speech over the last 46 years to criticize world leaders for what i see as their wrong - doings			2
" this drawing was a criticism of @entity4 , and not of the @entity60 people : there was no slight whatsoever intended against them			2
i was , however , stupidly completely unaware that it would be printed on @entity72 , and i apologize for the very unfortunate timing			0
" in the @entity75 , editor @entity74 wrote that the cartoon did " slip over the edge into anti-semitism , because it invokes the blood libel			1
" blood libel refers to a long - standing anti-semitic myth that @entity60 murder children to use their blood in religious rituals			1
" the blood libel is central to the history of @entity77			2
i do n't think @entity9 is an idiot -- far from it			0
so i find it impossible to believe he was unaware of the resonances of his cartoon , " @entity74 said			0
the @entity94 said it had lodged a complaint with @entity7 's press watchdog -- the @entity96			0
the cartoon , it said , was " shockingly reminiscent of the blood libel imagery more usually found in parts of the virulently anti-semitic @entity102 press			1
its use is all the more disgusting on @entity23 , given the similar tropes leveled against @entity60 by the @entity106			2
" meanwhile , an article by @entity108 in @entity5 newspaper @entity109 branded the cartoon " grossly offensive and unfair " but said it was not anti-semitic			0
@entity112 wrote that the cartoon was not directed at @entity60 , did not use @entity23 imagery and did not contain blood libel components			1
he said there was no discrimination in the sense that @entity9 's depiction of @entity4 was " par for the course for any politician when @entity9 is at his drawing board			0
" however , the @entity123 quoted the director of the @entity126 's @entity125 -- @entity127 -- as saying the " anti-semitic caricature of @entity4 " was " absolutely disgusting			0

@entity26 chairman @entity2 has apologized for " grotesque " cartoon
@entity6 cartoon portrayed @entity4 building @entity11 into bloody wall
@entity137 prompted *accusations* of anti-semitism and references to ' blood libel '
cartoonist said he was not aware it was @entity23
