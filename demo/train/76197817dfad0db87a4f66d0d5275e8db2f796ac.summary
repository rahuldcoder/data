@entity0 -- a small group of @entity4 revelers here ditched the traditional champagne toast , lighting up joints instead at a newly opened marijuana club			1
the members - only @entity10 is the first of its kind to open in @entity13 since november when voters approved @entity15 64 , which legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use			1
the club opened on @entity4 at 4:20 p.m. -- another significant number among pro-pot advocates -- to a small , but enthusiastic crowd of about a dozen people , all over the age of 21			1
each member paid a $ 29 fee , allowing them to bring their own weed and smoke anywhere on the premises			0
not all of @entity13 's marijuana advocates are celebrating			1
" much of our success with @entity15 was making the soccer moms comfortable , " said one advocate who campaigned to pass the amendment and declined to be named for fear of creating a rift within the marijuana advocacy community			1
" this is not the fight we want to have right now			0
" marijuana advocates hope to rise from ' prohibition ' even though the club does n't sell marijuana , the advocate said it " thwart ( s ) the intent of @entity15 , " which requires a year - long waiting period before stores are allowed to open and sell marijuana			1
that provision is designed to allow state and local governments enough time to regulate the industry and , proponents hope , to help ease fears in the community			0
despite new laws in @entity13 and @entity56 , federal law still prohibits recreational marijuana use			1
it 's unclear if the federal government will step in and try to stop either state 's laws from being enacted			2
the advocate expressed concern that unregulated marijuana clubs in @entity13 could create a bad impression on voters who supported the measure			1
" we have not only an opportunity but a responsibility to demonstrate to @entity77 this can work			0
" opinion : president needs to fix broken drug policy in a carefully worded statement , the advocacy director of @entity83 on @entity15 said that while @entity10 poses no risk to the community , it does put at risk the advances their cause has made			1
" we can best demonstrate that regulation is a much safer approach to marijuana policy than prohibition through the careful and swift creation of regulated businesses , " @entity91 said			2
those who showed up at @entity10 tuesday were n't interested in making sure " soccer moms " would approve of their behavior			2
they just wanted to celebrate their recent victory at the ballot box by ringing in the new year with their now legal drug of choice			0
" the voters of @entity13 have said we want cannabis to be legalized and we want a bunch of like - minded adults to be able to get together and exercise their constitutional rights together and that 's what @entity10 embodies , " said club owner @entity108			1
@entity115 , clad in an orange @entity117 cap , wasted no time filling a small glass pipe with marijuana he says he grew himself and lighting up			2
" it seems like up until today we were the kind of people that had to be secretive about who we were and how we lived our lives , " he said			0
" over the last couple of years we 've been able to start really talking more openly about what we do and people have accepted it and that 's great			0
i 'm glad to see that			0
" marijuana use holds steady among @entity77 teens @entity10 does n't have a permanent location and the address for the @entity4 celebration was distributed only to paying members			1
@entity108 hopes to make the club a monthly event , moving from location to location			0
long - time @entity0 marijuana activist @entity141 hopes @entity15 and @entity10 will serve as a model for other communities			1
" it 's a pathway to further freedom , " said @entity141			0
" are we truly free if all human beings can not possess marijuana ? not just in @entity13 but as a human rights campaign globally			2
let @entity0 be a beacon of hope for freedom , for true freedom			2
" @entity141 then fired up a joint , held in the smoke and exhaled with a series of coughs			0
" you ca n't get off if you do n't cough , " he said with a grin			0
the new year could bring a deeper divide among @entity13 's pro-marijuana advocates , as the state tries to figure out how to reconcile its new law with the federal government and the stigma surrounding the drug that advocates insist is no worse than alcohol			1
@entity108 , an attorney and a longtime marijuana advocate who is known for ruffling feathers , rejected the notion that his club is hampering efforts to make marijuana more socially and legally acceptable			2
" this is much larger than just marijuana , this is a civil rights struggle to end prohibition and civil rights struggles and overcoming oppression ( do ) not happen easily , " @entity108 said			0
" it has to happen by people taking chances and sometimes yes , pushing the envelope ... " and that is how change happens in this country and that 's what got us to this point -- people taking chances and pushing the envelope			0
