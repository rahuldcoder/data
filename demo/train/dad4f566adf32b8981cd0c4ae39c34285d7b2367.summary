-- leading international soccer player @entity1 , who plays for one of @entity4 's top clubs , insists he will walk off in a competitive game if he is subjected to further racist abuse			1
@entity9 football 's reputation has been tarnished by the scourge of racism this season but on thursday matters came to head when @entity14 star @entity1 kicked the ball into the stand and walked off after a group of fans had directed monkey chants at the @entity21 international and three of his teammates during a friendly match in northern @entity25			1
" i do n't care what game it is -- a friendly , @entity25 league or @entity30 match -- i would walk off again , " the @entity31 - born @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview on friday			1

" i 'm sad and angry that i 'm the one that has to take action , " added the @entity14 midfielder , who has also played in the @entity31 and @entity45 premier @entity43 during his career			1
" all the people who support me would support me in a big game			0
players like @entity52 and @entity53 have supported me and i just want to say thank you			0

during the friendly match , the @entity14 midfielder had told the referee three times he was being abused			1
" if it happens again i 'm not going to play anymore , " said @entity1 , who was born in @entity67			1

it 's not the first time in my life that i 've heard these things , but i 'm 25 now and i 've had enough this bulls * * *			0
" several of @entity1 's teammates -- @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 -- were also targeted by the monkey chanting fans			2

" we have to stop , look , and open our eyes			0
it was 100 % racist and had nothing to do with football ; it had nothing to do with our team playing against them like a rivalry and that is why i acted like that			0
" @entity25 prosecutors will press charges of inciting racial hatred against at least one person over the abuse that was directed at the @entity14 players			1

" there are so many people , @entity117 or whatever , that can do something against this			0
they should wake up and do it			0
" if there is a racism those people should be banned from the stadium forever			0
they should not even enter the stadium anymore			0
that 's the first thing they can do			0
" we have to open our eyes , open our ears , listen to everything , see everything , and react on that			0
" earlier @entity14 club president @entity135 and former @entity25 prime minister had warned that the @entity63 team will leave the pitch if they are faced with further anti-social behavior			1
