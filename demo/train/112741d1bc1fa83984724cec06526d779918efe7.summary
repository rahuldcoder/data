@entity0 -- @entity2 knew the risks to his health by working in an agate factory , but at $ 4 a day the rewards were too great			2
now , after 14 years of breathing in the fine dust created by grinding and polishing the gemstone , @entity2 has silicosis , a respiratory disease that swells the lungs			1
" he 's thankful to the stone because it helped him survive for so long			2
but now that he has lost so much , it is also a feeling of anger , " @entity2 told @entity1 through an interpreter , @entity14 , the co-ordinator for the @entity15 , @entity16 of @entity17			2
" he has lost his parents to it , and he himself knows he 's going to die some day , " he said			2
it 's not known how many other workers in @entity27 are suffering from occupational diseases , but the @entity29 ( @entity30 ) has warned that the region is facing an epidemic			1
the last estimate on work - related diseases in @entity27 was released by the @entity35 in 2008			1
it estimated that more than 1.1 million people in @entity27 were dying each year			1
" one - point - one million is a really high number , but even then we 're not sure , we think it may be a really conservative number , " said @entity38 , executive director of the @entity30			1
frustrated by the lack of official records , @entity38 and his team set out to find the true extent of the problem in six @entity27 countries : @entity48 , @entity17 , @entity49 , the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
a report released ahead of this year 's @entity54 on april 28 , found similar problems in all countries ; a lack of official data on the number of cases , partly due to a reluctance to diagnose work - related illness for fear of the financial cost			1
" the problem is there is no data , absolutely no data			1
you can get quarterly data for economic statistics , but you ca n't get any data about the workers ... what is their health , how are they faring ? there is no data on that , " @entity38 said			1
the problem is not being recognized nor addressed , @entity38 said , because governments and industry in the region are prioritizing economic growth over people			1
" i think it 's complete apathy from the government , from the industry and from all of us as a society			2
we 're just too insensitive			2
we think it 's ok for people to die producing things			2
i can not understand , " he said			0
@entity95 fights back tears when asked how her life has changed since she suffered the effects of cadium poisoning after working 15 years in a battery factory in @entity48			0
" before i found myself having the cadium poisoning i felt my life and work were quite happy			0
although it was sometimes tiring , but i also found my job rewarding , i liked my job , " she said in an interview with @entity1			0
@entity95 was a relatively highly paid engineer in charge of maintaining the battery - making machines			0
" after this poisoning and my kidney was badly destroyed so my body became very weak , " she said , adding that she no longer works due to the effects of kidney failure			2
@entity95 said she has struggled to find a doctor in @entity48 willing to certify her illness as an occupational disease , a pre-condition of any claim for compensation			1
@entity38 said in many cases employees have struggled to even prove they were employed			1
" it 's coming up as a major issue , especially in @entity48			0
the first thing they have to do if somebody gets sick , they have to submit their work contract			0
and many times they do n't have that			0
and employers refuse to give it			0
so it 's a very complicated procedure they 're made to go through , " he said			0
in other cases , workers , especially migrants , are not covered by labor laws			0
when they get ill , they go home and for employers the problem disappears			1
a lack of regulation over the use of toxic materials is also exacerbating workplace illness , @entity38 added			1
" the problem in @entity27 we face is that industries still use a lot of hazardous materials and chemicals which may be banned elsewhere			1
it 's banned in almost 80 countries worldwide			0
we still use it in @entity27 , " he said			1
non-governmental organizations are working within countries to try to warn workers of the cost , and to encourage victims to unite to try to push for compensation			0
in @entity2 's village of @entity170 in the @entity172 region of @entity173 , @entity17 , efforts are underway to educate workers at the agate factories , and to find them other , safer sources of income			0
" the organization has been trying to rehabilitate people , find alternative employment for people , in arts and agriculture , " @entity14 said			0
" but of course it does n't pay as much as this work pays , but at least they 'll still be alive for a long time			0
