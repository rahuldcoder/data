-- a @entity2 family fighting to keep their 13 - month - old son on a breathing tube says they have been denied a request to have him transferred to a hospital in @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity11 refused to sign consent when @entity2 health officials determined their son @entity14 , who suffers from a progressive degenerative neurological disease and was in a persistent vegetative state , should be removed from life support			1
@entity14 is being treated at the @entity18 in @entity19			0
the @entity20 reached out to the @entity21 in @entity22 in hopes of having their son transferred there for continued care			2
family spokesperson @entity27 said the hospital initially agreed to accept the transfer			1
he said he has since received an email indicating the request has been denied			0
@entity27 forwarded an email from the @entity22 hospital that he said explains that after a review of @entity14 's records by neurological and intensive care physicians , " we can not offer @entity14 anything that he has not been provided already during his current admission by his current clinical care team ... transfer to our facility will not provide him or the family any benefit			1
" @entity44 , a spokesperson from the @entity21 , confirmed @entity14 is not a patient at the hospital but could not offer further comment , citing patient privacy laws			2
@entity27 said the family is pursuing at least three other hospitals in other states			2
@entity14 's decline @entity14 was born on january 22 , 2010 , and his parents say they noticed something was wrong when he was around 3 months old			0
" he could n't eat by mouth			2
he would n't open his eyes			2
he did n't cry , and he could n't breathe well , " said his father in a phone conversation			2
the family lives on the @entity2 - @entity9 border , and they took @entity14 to a @entity9 hospital a few miles from @entity64 , @entity19 , in june			1
he was diagnosed with a metabolic brain disease			0
" he saw a neurologist who told us our son would be ok , but may be developmentally delayed , " said @entity11			1
" never did they say he would die			0
" after being treated in @entity9 , @entity14 returned to normal , the family said			2
after nearly a month of treatment , he started playing with his brother and began eating again			2
he was fine until october , when he developed a fever			0
his father noticed rapid breathing			0
@entity11 says he rushed his son to an emergency room in @entity2			1
@entity14 was in respiratory distress			0
that hospital did n't have a pediatric emergency room , so the infant was moved to @entity18			1
disagreement on diagnosis the family says the hospital has it wrong and that their son is not in a persistent vegetative state			1
@entity27 said they have noted experiences where the baby has responded to being tickled and has jolted when he felt discomfort with examinations or the feeding tubes			0
they say these are signs he might still have brain function			0
however , @entity2 health officials disagree			1
on february 17 , they decided @entity14 should be removed from life support			1
the family was given until february 21 to say their goodbyes and sign the consent , but they have yet to do so			0
the @entity104 are seeking a second opinion from what they consider to be an objective source that can review the more than 1,000 pages of @entity14 's medical records and provide a better assessment of their son 's treatment options			0
if he is beyond hope , they want him to be able to receive a tracheotomy , where he can be transferred home and die in the care of family instead of in a hospital			1
experts say even if the family is granted this request , caring for a child in this condition is an arduous task			0
dr. @entity126 , director of research and evaluation at the @entity130 's @entity129 , says patients at home with tracheotomies need monitoring to make sure the airway is clear of secretions , the skin is clean and dry and someone can make sure the incision at the tracheotomy site does not get infected			0
" a child 's care would be much more complex if a home ventilator is required , since the parents would need to manage the ventilator with the help of a nurse and respiratory therapist , " he said			0
parallels with @entity149 the family plight has caught the attention of @entity149 , the brother of @entity149			1
she was the woman whose family fought to have her sustained on a feeding tube for more than a decade and who became the centerpiece of a national right - to - die battle in the @entity159			1
" there are some parallels , " @entity160 said			0
" the family 's intention is to bring the baby home and show him the love and compassion that only families can really give a child , just like we did with my sister @entity174 , " he says			1
@entity160 is joined by a coalition of advocates en route to @entity2 to help the @entity104 with their case			1
@entity179 , spokesperson for the @entity180 and @entity182 's sister , issued the following statement : " it is unacceptable for @entity185 and / or the @entity2 government to make decisions for @entity14 that will end his life and deny the wishes of his loving parents			1
" every patient , regardless of age , has a right to proper and dignified health care			0
it is frightening to once again see government usurp the @entity198 - given rights of parents to love and care for their child at home , especially when the child is dying			0
