-- a teenager who set up a school to educate children in a refugee camp , a youth who built a windmill to generate power for the houses in his community with no access to electricity and a 17 - year - old with @entity9 who founded a charity to help others infected with the virus			1
these are just a few of the students hand - picked to attend @entity21 ( @entity22 ) -- a prestigious school in @entity24 , @entity25 that aims to create the continent 's leaders of tomorrow			1
the initiative is the brainchild of @entity30 , a @entity31 - born entrepreneur who hopes to instil a new generation with the skills to navigate @entity25 towards prosperity in future years			1
" we get young people from all across the continent , bring them here initially for two years [ and ] give them this hands - on leadership practice , " says @entity30			1
" i believe that you do n't learn leadership through theory , you learn leadership by leading and so that 's what we 're trying to replicate here at the academy , " he adds			0
@entity30 explains that the @entity22 tasks students with starting their own businesses and working closely with the local communities situated around the school			1
they are also taught about the roles of @entity54 and @entity55 as well as other senior positions within business , politics and industry			0
this , he says , helps prepare them for a future at the very top of society , whilst equipping them with the skills " to do something much bigger for the continent " in the future			2
from his experience of recruiting across the continent , @entity30 concludes that @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 are producing the best students , while schools are weakest in @entity78 and @entity25			1
so far over 400 students have taken part in the @entity22 's leadership program and over the next 50 years , @entity30 says the school 's aim is to create 6,000 new leaders for @entity25			1
relationships have been set up with over 2,500 educational institutions across the continent to identify the most suitable candidates to fulfill these roles , while the @entity90 also helps locate individuals of high potential from various refugee camps			0
this rigorous selection process is designed to single out not only the brightest students from a variety of socio - economic backgrounds , but also those who have shown strong tendencies towards initiative , communication and leadership , @entity30 says			2
" the best leaders are not necessarily the smartest people , " he explains			0
" at the heart of what we 're doing is a belief that the main reason why @entity25 has not met its full potential today is due to the quality of the leaders that we have , " he says			0
" so this is really an attempt to solve that issue ... the @entity117 , is really saying : let 's address [ this ] , instead of trying to deal with all the symptoms of bad leadership that we have in @entity25			0
" @entity30 identifies his own formative experiences as a teenager as a key factor in his desire to found the @entity22 at just 17 years old -- and on a gap year before beginning university -- he was appointed headmaster of a school in @entity131			1
he says the practical knowledge he gained in his time there gave him the confidence necessary to achieve success later on in his career , not least in setting up the @entity22 " i firmly believe that a leadership experience that a young person gets in their teens particularly , gives them the foundation to do something much bigger later on in their lives , " he says			2
he cites luminaries such as @entity148 founder @entity147 , @entity149 and @entity150 -- who were all exposed to leadership situations in their youth -- as the type of characters he hopes the @entity22 will produce			2
" we 're trying to create leaders in all segments of society , so leaders in science and technology , leaders in business , entrepreneurs who can create the millions of jobs that we need on the continent , political leaders who can create the policies that we need to develop properly , " he says			0
" we really need leaders from all walks of life to solve the diverse challenge that we have in @entity25 , " he adds			0
by equipping the continent 's most talented youngsters with the qualities necessary to lead on their own accord , @entity30 has taken the first steps towards creating an @entity25 more equipped to meet these challenges head on			2
