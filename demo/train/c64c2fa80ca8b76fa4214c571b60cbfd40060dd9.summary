-- why dream of a white @entity2 ? people in the upper @entity4 are fully expecting a white @entity5 on tuesday			1
an icy blast out of @entity7 is expected to drop a swath of snow from @entity10 down through @entity11 and northern @entity12 and over to northern @entity13			1
an earlier - than - usual deep freeze in the @entity4 will follow , sending cold but not frigid temperatures to other parts of the @entity17 by thursday			0
in @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity18 was surprised by the early advent of winter weather			1
she woke up monday to find snow on the ground			1
" this is the first snow i 've seen this season , and it 's a major snowstorm , rather than the usual light dusting you 'd expect to start off the winter with , " she said			1
" i think that 's the biggest thing -- that we went from a very warm and mild fall to now being thrust so abruptly into winter			1
" @entity34 got several inches of snow on monday and expected more on tuesday morning			1
but heavier snow fell not far away			1
@entity38 , @entity20 , about 70 miles northwest of @entity34 , reported a whopping 16.5 inches of snow monday , according to the @entity40			1
" right now it 's freezing to the roads , creating slippery conditions , " said sgt. @entity41 of the @entity42 , a jurisdiction that includes @entity38			0
" plow trucks are having trouble with it			0
it just throws cars in ditches			0
" we 've managed to get everybody home			0
we do n't have anyone stuck at convenience stores or service stations			0
it 's very slow going though			0
" temperatures plummeted on monday across the @entity4			1
in @entity62 , @entity63 , the sunday high was 53 , but on monday , it barely got into the 20s			2
by tuesday , it will be only 8			0
the weather is the result of a " bomb cyclone " -- a swiftly and markedly intensifying storm -- that shifted the path of the jet stream and sent cold air rushing toward the @entity17 , @entity0 meteorologist @entity66 said			1
a weekend buzz but people in the @entity76 know how to deal with snow			2
" this has been the buzz this weekend , " @entity79 , an employee at @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity83			1
" everyone is talking about the storm that we are supposed to be getting			1
most of our customers love to be outdoors so everyone is really looking forward to it , " he said			0
in @entity94 , @entity93 told @entity0 affiliate wqow the snow 's coming at the perfect time			1
" especially two weeks before gun hunting ( season ) , that 's always going to help the deer move , " he told the station			0
despite the enthusiasm , some problems were evident			0
@entity104 reported that 153 flights were canceled monday at @entity107 airport			1
that 's a lot , especially considering only 225 cancellations were reported across the entire @entity17			2
@entity111 roads were reported throughout the region			2
@entity114 spokesman lt. @entity113 said troopers responded to 475 crashes from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. monday , 45 with injuries and one fatal			1
he reported 702 spinouts and incidents of vehicles running off the road			2
in @entity82 , a school bus slipped off a road in @entity124 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity125			1
no students were hurt , but the driver and an aide were taken to a hospital for evaluation , the station reported			2
the coming snowfall could snap tree limbs and branches , bring down power lines and cause widespread outages , said @entity0 meteorologist @entity137			1
" it 's ok to get a nice cold snap now and then , but this one could be dangerous , " @entity137 said			0
the northern @entity140 , the @entity141 and the @entity4 are not the only targets			2
much of the nation will feel the punch of cold weather , if not quite as hard , according to @entity0 meteorologists			1
" i think we 're all going to be feeling the bite , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity147 said			1
prefer snow or cold ? it 's hard to decide whether the snap will be more bearable in @entity153 , @entity63 , or in @entity154 , @entity82			1
if you prefer bitter cold over deep snow , you might like it better in @entity153			2
it did n't exactly live up to its name early monday with a low of 4 degrees predicted by the @entity40			2
by tuesday night it should drop to 11 below zero , and it wo n't rise above 6 degrees through thursday night , the @entity40 forecasts			0
@entity163 fell there early monday and was expected to continue through tuesday , but only about 3 inches should accumulate			2
not enough snow for you ? then @entity154 is your place			2
fourteen to 22 inches were forecast for monday and overnight into tuesday , then 2 to 4 inches for @entity5 on tuesday for a whopping total of 16 to 26 inches			2
broad sweep south the cold snap will bring lows in the teens and single digits into @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 this week but also spread freezing temperatures as far south as @entity177			0
" much of the nation east of the @entity180 is expected to see a major pattern change by the beginning of the work week , " the weather service said			2
the frosty blast will move across the rest of the @entity17 but not be as harsh as in the @entity4			0
@entity186 and @entity187 , @entity188 , are expecting daytime high temperatures of 46 on friday , according to the @entity40			0
that was close to the nighttime low for both cities on monday			0
but even in the thick of it , some places will pull the longer straw			0
@entity197 should see more rain than snow , @entity200 the same , and temperatures there should be relatively mild , the weather service said			1
thanks , @entity203 ! residents in the northern @entity17 can thank a whopping @entity206 tropical cyclone for the wintry blast			1
@entity208 was akin to @entity209 and @entity210 rolled into one			0
it had the strength of a category 5 hurricane , @entity0 's @entity137 said			1
it is the strongest @entity214 post-tropical cyclone on record , the @entity40 said			0
its remnants explosively intensified up north over @entity218 's @entity217 last week and plowed into cold air , which added violent energy to the storm			0
it was similar to what happened with @entity210 in the @entity224 two years ago and earned the storm the little - used " bomb cyclone " moniker			1
the hybrid storm rammed into the jet stream , causing it to whip south , dragging @entity230 air down with it			0
it also continued to spin , @entity137 said , further fanning down polar cold			0
