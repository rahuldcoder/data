the leadership of @entity1 must think they have hit the jackpot			1
the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in northeast @entity6 has been denounced by @entity8 president @entity7 and @entity10 prime minister @entity9			1
that has given them all the publicity they crave			2
their movement is now the top item on all global news channels			0
if , as i suspect , @entity1 sees itself as a suicide mission to inspire all muslims to follow them and wage war on the @entity24 , they must feel their hour has come			1
the final battle is about to begin			0
bornu state @entity6 is one of the poorest , most neglected parts of the planet			1
until recently i would have said the only surplus in that part of @entity6 was its long - suffering @entity33 resignation			1
now that has turned to anger			0
and this remote , dry , dusty corner of @entity6 , a place you would only visit on your way to the @entity41 , has become the new battleground between @entity43 and the western world			1
how ? the answer lies in a very telling comment from @entity47 , the @entity8 secretary of state			1
the @entity8 had , he said repeatedly offered help to @entity6 but it was ignored			1
that is exactly what the @entity6 government 's attitude has been to the northeast for decades -- and to the @entity1 terrorists until they hit @entity58 , the capital			1
then there was an attempt to clamp down but the security extended there never reached @entity63 , the capital of @entity65 state in the northeast and some 500 miles away from @entity58 , the capital , and another 320 miles from @entity67 , the commercial megacity of @entity69			0
so it does n't matter			0
just as the kidnapping of more than 200 girls did not elicit any statement from president @entity74 until more than two weeks after it happened			2
nor do the levels of poverty , unemployment , lack of education and health services and a fast - growing population in the northeast matter to the government of @entity6			1
its income derives from @entity86 oil companies so the government has little democratic relationship with the people of @entity6			1
sixty per cent live in poverty			0
@entity1 began as a fundamentalist but not particularly violent movement in 2002			1
the killing of its leader , @entity94 , while in police custody inspired its members to take up arms against the state			0
@entity6 police said @entity94 had been shot while trying to escape , but other reports said he had been summarily executed			1
the police force , which in normal times just collects " personal fines " from motorists and others for minor transgressions , is too corrupt to protect anyone			0
meanwhile the army , trained to fight a conventional war , went in heavily and terrified rather than protected the population			0
on this day last year @entity1 attacked a barracks , a prison and a police post in the town of @entity115			2
the military said the group killed 55 people and freed 105 prisoners			2
@entity6 is used to uprisings			2
a few years ago the @entity121 which produces @entity6 's immense oil wealth , was in flames			1
gangs of youths with heavy machine guns killed their rivals and kidnapped oil workers for cash			0
they too played on the neglect of the local population which could see billions of dollars - worth of oil being sucked out from under their feet while not a single road was being built			0
the government of @entity74 -- himself from the @entity138 -- now administers an amnesty program under which former militants receive payments to give up their arms			2
many of the militants were given jobs in the government and swapped their tee - shirts and bandanas for sharp suits and ties			2
but there is no such incentive to develop @entity65 state			0
it produces nothing and will not vote for president @entity74			0
unless there is a major political upset , he will serve another four - year term after elections in february next year			0
the big challenge in @entity6 for the @entity8 military and intelligence services is this : if they limit their intervention purely to tracking down and releasing the girls and killing or capturing their @entity1 kidnappers , they will have a brief success followed by long term failure			1
no movement like @entity1 can exist for long without some , at least tacit , support of the local people			1
and the local people have little to thank the government for			0
i was on the beach at @entity177 in 1992 when the @entity178 stormed ashore followed by waves of @entity180			0
for a few weeks @entity181 was quite peaceful , mission accomplished was the message			0
we wrote positive stories about the restoration of @entity181			0
the war has continued to this day			0
two years later i followed the @entity180 into @entity188 and then into @entity189 in the first @entity190			0
problem solved , it seemed			0
and i worked in @entity193 in the early 1970s where the @entity10 army was always claiming to be on the brink of defeating the @entity197			2
that very attitude simply strengthened them			0
have the lessons from @entity189 , @entity201 , @entity193 been learned ? military intervention is tough but easy compared with the long haul of development which must accompany it			1
the @entity207 people of northeast @entity6 need robust protection , peace and security in the short term but they also need education , health services and livelihoods in the long term			1
they need to know that the @entity6 government and its @entity8 supporters are on their side			1
can @entity8 provide that ? or will we see a magnificent charge , lots of shoot - outs and arrests followed by a declaration of peace , the departure of the army and then an even worse uprising two years hence ? the biggest challenge facing @entity7 and the @entity8 is the failure of president @entity74 to focus on the problems of northeast @entity6			1
together they need to make a long term plan to bring investment to the area , provide health and education services and build institutions			2
above all make the people there feel they are part of this booming new @entity6 economy which recently became the biggest in @entity69			2
@entity244 exclusive : @entity6 girl who escaped @entity1 says she still feels afraid			1

@entity10 , @entity8 have denounced @entity1 's abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls in @entity6
@entity250 says their *reaction* has given the militant group the publicity it craves
@entity6 's government has long ignored the area where @entity1 is based , he says
he says necessary development there is a bigger task than any military intervention
