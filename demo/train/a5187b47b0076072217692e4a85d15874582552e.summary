-- although most @entity5 would be too modest to say so themselves , @entity4 can stake a decent claim to being the capital of @entity3			1
built on 14 islands , @entity4 seems to float on water			2
built on 14 islands where @entity8 meets the @entity9 , @entity4 is a soft - hued vision of light and water , the bewitching start to an archipelago of some 24,000 islands and islets			2
@entity5 's neutrality during @entity18 means @entity4 was spared the bombing inflicted on most @entity21 capitals ; the result is the unspoiled old town of @entity24 , with its winding , cobbled streets			1
despite a post-war building blitz that saw the construction of some particularly uninspiring modernist architecture , it is a city where gray concrete facades are largely eschewed in favor of a smorgasbord of pastel colors , rusty reds and glowing ochres			0
for a capital city it 's unusually green -- not just leafy and dotted with verdant parks , but environmentally sound			1
@entity4 proper has a population of just 800,000 , avoiding the congestion and pollution that plague larger cities -- so much so that you can fish from , and swim in , the waters surrounding the city center			1
cold and sometimes bleak during its long , dark winters , @entity4 comes alive during the summer , when the @entity3 sun barely sets			1
as temperatures rise the city 's cafe culture blossoms , only for @entity4 to become a ghost town during july , when the locals make the most of their generous holiday entitlement and slip off to holiday cottages in the archipelago			1
but beyond its historic heart @entity4 is a progressive , evolving city			1
its financial fortunes grew with the mid ' 90s it boom and shrank when the dotcom bubble burst , but it remains a hotbed of technology and communications companies			0
watch @entity66 's @entity65 take @entity0 on a tour of @entity4 » around 20 percent of the residents of greater @entity4 are of foreign descent , giving a sense of cultural diversity -- not to mention some welcome variety to the city 's thriving restaurant scene			1
despite @entity5 's largely anti-eu stance , @entity4 is cosmopolitan and outward looking , with a keen eye for the latest international trends			2
its shops are filled with the latest in functional , minimalist @entity5 design and there are enough boutiques boasting hip @entity83 brands and cool @entity5 labels to indulge @entity86 ' obsession with style			0
it 's also the city where @entity5 global exports @entity88 and @entity90 have their flagship stores			2
for all its picture - postcard pleasantness and progressive civic planning , @entity4 can seem a little sterile			0
it 's not the kind of place likely to be described as " edgy			0
" @entity86 themselves can come across as standoffish , but that 's not say that they are unfriendly -- just politely reserved			0
small talk is regarded with a certain suspicion meaning the locals can be hard to get to know , but it 's amazing what a difference a couple of glasses of akvavit can make			0
@entity107 legal regulations mean that high - alcohol drinks ( that 's anything with more than 3.5 percent alcohol ) are heavily taxed and can only be bought in bars and government - run " @entity114 " shops			0
the result is that a night on the town is expensive enough to make anyone teetotal , with @entity86 often avoiding midweek drinking , saving their krona for weekend partying			0
but what @entity4 lacks in grit it more than makes up for in style			0
from its artfully designed coffee shops to the classic contours of its baroque and rococo buildings , this island city is endlessly pleasing to behold , especially when viewed from the water that flows like blood through its veins .			1

from artfully designed cafes to baroque buildings , @entity4 *exudes* cool
the island city has *dubbed* itself the capital city of @entity3
city blossoms in the summer when temperatures rise and sun barely sets
influx of *immigrants* has added new *dimension* to city 's *gastronomic* scene
