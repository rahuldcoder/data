but " what has not been widely reported is that the auction consignor purchased the item at a public auction in the @entity91 in february 2012 for $ 3,550 , " @entity8 said thursday			1
the seller said the letter of provenance was included when they bought the item			0

since 30 years had passed by , he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that i was free to do ... whatever i wanted with it			0
" the writer said he did not want to return the vial to @entity4 's family , " since i had served under pres. @entity4 when he was my commander in chief when i was in the @entity139 from ' 87 - ' 91 and that i was a real fan of @entity140 and felt that pres. @entity4 himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it			1
" the publicity generated by the sale on @entity8 " has clearly highlighted the importance of this historical artifact and i would personally be delighted to see this important artifact put on public display by the foundation , " the recent seller said			1
@entity8 noted the donation was " a considerable financial gesture from the consignor			0
" the presidential foundation , in a tuesday statement , had said it would " use every legal means " to stop the sale or purchase of the vial			1
" while we contend that the removal of the vial from the hospital laboratory and the @entity91 auction sale in february were not legal acts in our opinion , we are grateful to the current custodian of the vial for this generous donation to the foundation ensuring president @entity4 's blood remains out of public hands , " @entity17 , the foundation 's executive director , said thursday .			1
