-- say " urban poor , " and the image that most likely comes to mind is one of young black men caught up in a swirl of drugs and violence and irresponsible single women having babies			1
but this pervasive stereotype overlooks a surprising reality : many whites live @entity13 in some of the country 's poorest urban neighborhoods			2
because white poverty is less expected , less recognized and less studied , we often exclude poor whites from our discussions			1
that masks a fundamental truth about economic inequality : poverty is colorblind			0
but neither is it the same for everyone , as the white poor benefit from a lifetime of the hidden perks of white privilege			1
as our nation continues down the road of economic recovery , this is a reality our local and national policymakers can not afford to ignore as they seek to address employment and income inequality			0
we traced the experience of nearly 800 children in @entity38 for more than 25 years , from the time they entered first grade in the fall of 1982 in 20 @entity38 public schools to well into their third decade			1
half their families were low income , according to school records , and the typical low - income parent had n't finished high school			0
what might be surprising is that of that half , 40 % are white			0
looking at where these children started in life and where they ended up , the study results are troubling but clear : at 28 , hardly any of the children from a disadvantaged background , black or white , had finished college			1
but even without the benefit of a college degree , whites , and white men especially , had vastly better employment outcomes			1
at every age , the white men experienced shorter spells of unemployment , were more likely to be working full - time and earned more			1
@entity38 , like so many other @entity70 cities , suffered immensely under the ravages associated with de-industrialization : the loss of industry , population and wealth			2
under such circumstances , many of the city 's disadvantaged youths stumbled along the way			0
but the consequences have been especially dire for @entity70			0
as young adults , @entity70 - @entity70 men had fared much worse than whites in the job market , even though they and their white counterparts had about the same levels of education and the whites reported higher rates of marijuana and heavy drug use and binge drinking			1
take , for example , the types of jobs the men in our study held			2
at 28 , nearly half of the white men who had not attended college were employed in the industrial and construction trades , the highest - paying sector of blue - collar employment			1
by contrast , only 15 % of @entity70 men worked in these sectors , and even within that small group , annual earnings were less than half that of whites -- $ 21,500 versus $ 43,000			2
this disparity is no accident			0
it fits a broader pattern evident as far back as high school : about one - fifth of white men who grew up in disadvantaged families had after - school and summer jobs in these industries -- important experience that can help secure a full - time job -- while not a single @entity70 - @entity70 person did			1
indeed , throughout the course of our study , it was clear that african - americans face greater barriers to employment			0
having an arrest record or failing to complete high school were less consequential for white men than for @entity70 men : 84 % of whites without a high school degree were employed at 22 ; among @entity70 , just 40 % were			1
racial inequality also is embedded in hidden ways in other spheres of life , including discrimination in housing and banking practices that have kept white and black @entity38 substantially separate and cut off working class @entity70 from potentially valuable social contacts			1
why do differences in employment track so sharply with color lines ? the race - based privilege that benefits working - class whites over working - class african - americans has its origins in the discriminatory practices that excluded african - americans from the skilled trades during @entity38 's booming @entity158 and post-war industrial economy			1
although overt racial discrimination has lessened since then , the deep structural inequalities these barriers helped establish continue today through word - of - mouth hiring , employer attitudes that limit opportunities for african - americans and segregated social networks			0
the differences in how these young people found jobs illustrate the invisible ways race - based privilege is institutionalized in the job market			2
when asked at age 22 how they found their current jobs , whites more often mentioned help from family and friends , while more african - americans found jobs " on their own			2
" the white job seekers in our study had family , friends and neighbors who could help them access good - quality , higher - paying jobs			1
and what of those women having babies ? most of the women of disadvantaged background , white and @entity70 , became mothers as teenagers , worked sporadically and when working , their employment was concentrated in the low - pay clerical and service sectors			2
the difference , though , is that many more white women were married or in a stable co-habiting relationship			0
an additional earner in the household makes a vast difference in economic well - being , which means that white men 's workplace advantages benefit white women as well			2
as @entity70 , we like to think that we are all on a level playing field			0
our society treasures rags - to - riches stories of individuals overcoming their humble origins to achieve the @entity218			0
but , the harsh reality we witnessed in @entity38 is that race and class place severe limitations on a child 's ability to achieve that dream			0
too often , our policymakers focus on colorblind solutions , such as the @entity228 , to help the urban poor			1
such programs only help those who already have jobs and fail to address chronic unemployment among african - americans			0
amid the growing national conversation on economic inequality , now is the time for our leaders to recognize that race matters and develop creative programs , such as president @entity241 's " @entity242 " initiative , to address the different challenges facing poor african - americans			0
tracking the lives of @entity38 children for 25 years , we witnessed all too clearly how family conditions and poverty early in life cast a shadow that follows children into adulthood and how that shadow extends much further if you are @entity70			1
only by facing this reality head on with proactive programs and policies can we offer young african - americans a fair shot at achieving the @entity70 dream .			0

***authors*** : " urban poor " is not just black men , single moms ; many whites fit the category
for 25 years , ***authors*** studied poor children through their adulthood in @entity38
***authors*** : hardly any poor children , black or white , went on to finish college
