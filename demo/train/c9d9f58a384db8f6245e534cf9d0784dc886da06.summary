when @entity2 started out in the advertising industry in the 1980s , @entity1 adverts were often dismissed as mere propaganda , unable to compete with powerful @entity6 agencies			1
now in 2014 , the country 's advertising market is the world 's second largest , perhaps thanks in part to @entity11 - born @entity2 , ceo of @entity12			1
meeting in the luxurious @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity14 's @entity13 spoke to the woman leading an industry tipped to exceed $ 50 billion in revenues by 2015			1
@entity13 : what are some of your most creative campaigns ? @entity24 : in 2012 we created a poster campaign for @entity28 , it was called " @entity33 " and won the @entity29 at @entity30 -- it was recognized as a cultural icon for the people			1
recently in @entity11 we did a campaign for a local bank			1
the tv campaign featured a group of six senior citizens who were not in good shape , but had a dream			2
in honor of their dead friends they decided to ride motorcycles around the island			2
the campaign was very successful on @entity48 and on social media			2
@entity50 : what 's your daily work schedule like ? @entity24 : i wake up at 5am and exercise before i do anything else , and i finish work around 9pm or 10pm			1
when i first started out i worked seven days a week			2
but that was terrible and gave me some spine problems			2
in recent years i 've been very disciplined			2
i work during the week and at the weekend i spend time with my friends			1
it 's important to take a break , breathe and see the world			1
at the beginning of your career you have to learn a lot			2
you have to invest yourself , and you need to work hard			1
you have to go the extra mile when you are in the early stages of your career			0
@entity50 : in every career , there is always at least one colossal failure			0
what has been your biggest mistake ? @entity24 : my biggest mistake was in 1995 , when i was leading @entity11			0
@entity77 had just bought @entity78 and enforced a lot of financial discipline			0
my executive creative director decided to leave			0
he thought our culture had changed and there was too much focus on finance and numbers			0
so he left , and so did a group of senior people			0
but i was able to bounce back with a new team , and it took us one and a half years to bounce back , but we worked together and gained a good creative reputation in @entity11			0
i would say that was my biggest hurdle			0
@entity50 : who shaped you and influenced you the most growing up ? @entity24 : my family has a lot of strong women			0
my aunts are very , very strong , and they take care of everyone			0
so i think i learned a lot from them , and then also i read a lot			0
in terms of advertising i would have to say @entity78 , our founder			1
i translated one of his books , and i learned a lot about how to lead the company and the company culture			0
and then our current global ceo , @entity117 , the reason i name him is because i think he 's probably one of very few leaders that is very business focused , but also very people oriented			1
@entity50 : will there ever be a @entity1 female president ? @entity24 : i think in @entity11 it 's very likely			1
@entity50 : what is your advice to young women starting out in marketing communications , pr or advertising , what do you want to tell them ? @entity24 : i want to tell them you have to be brave			1
you have to stand up for yourself , you have to show that we have what it takes to be in charge			0
learn : how @entity137 conquered fashion world inspire : @entity140 : positive images spur change			1
