-- @entity2 users will be seeing a new look on their desktops and laptops soon , one that will look familiar if they also use the app on their smartphones			1
in a post monday afternoon , @entity2 announced " a refreshed twitter.com reflecting the look & feel of our @entity15 & @entity16 apps			1
" the look wo n't be a change for some users			0
@entity2 has been testing out the new design on about 1 % of people who use the site , studying their habits and making tweaks before rolling it out to everyone			2
the main change , other than aesthetics , is a built - in " compose " box in the left rail of the web page			1
the new location eliminates the old pop - up style compose box and appears to be a way for @entity2 to encourage more users to actually tweet instead of just browse			1
@entity2 has said in the past that as many as 40 % of its users are " lurkers , " folks who read what others post but do n't share anything themselves			2
users also will see their profile and header photos at the top of a rail on the left of the page			0
the main @entity2 feed appears to be largely unchanged			0
the new design had not appeared for all users as of tuesday			0
@entity2 did n't offer a specific timetable ,			0
