@entity0 -- a federal jury in @entity0 ruled tuesday that a man who identifies as black and @entity4 and the nonprofit he founded must pay punitive damages to an @entity8 employee after a previous ruling that the use of the " n - word " is inappropriate among minorities in a workplace			1
the ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by @entity16 , who is @entity8 , against @entity17 , the employment center where she worked , claiming she was a victim of a hostile workplace after enduring verbal harassment and a series of statements filled with profanity and racial slurs from her supervisor			2
the employment center in @entity29 argued that the use of the word was part of a " tough - love culture			0
" the jury ruled tuesday that center founder @entity35 must pay $ 25,000 and his organization must pay $ 5,000 in punitive damages			1
jurors last week awarded $ 250,000 in compensatory damages to @entity16 , 38 , who sued @entity35 personally and @entity17 , which he founded in 1984			1
@entity35 's lawyer , @entity41 , issued a statement that said in part : " we are disappointed by the verdict , as we do not believe that it comports with the full facts applicable to the case			0
nevertheless , we respect the jury 's decision and the judicial process			0
we are exploring all our options moving forward , including appeal , and look forward to the judicial process taking its entire course			0
" @entity57 's ceo apologizes to @entity59 customer for employee 's racist rant @entity35 's n - word - peppered rant toward @entity16 was captured on a four - minute audio recording on @entity16 's @entity65 without her boss knowing in march 2012 and was played for a federal jury last week			1
" you and ( a previous employee ) are just alike			0
both of you are smart as s --- , but dumb as s ---			0
you know what it is ... both of you are n --- --- , y'all act like n --- --- all the time , " @entity35 said to @entity16 , according to audio evidence played in court and obtained by @entity1			1
@entity35 called @entity16 the n - word eight times during the recording			1
" and i 'm not saying the term n --- --- as derogatory ; sometimes it 's good to know when to act like a n --- -- , but y'all act like n --- --- all the time ... both of you very bright , but both y'all act like n --- --- at inappropriate times , " @entity35 said in the audio recording			1
from the stand tuesday , @entity35 explained tearfully that he was only trying to help			0
" i come from a different time ... what i 'm trying to do is help ... that 's the transition ... ( this case ) has showed me i got to take stock in that at my age , " said @entity35 , 61			1

the center 's website says that it has helped nearly 50,000 individuals across @entity109 enter the workforce			0
' @entity111 ' conveys history of bigotry that still resonates " this case is most important because this is the first where we essentially have the n - word on trial , " said @entity16 's attorney , @entity114			1
" you have heard the connotation that the n - word can have different meanings depending on the speaker ; there is an undisguised belief that if the person saying the n - word is black or @entity8 , somehow it makes it ok			1
" there are a number of cases where the n - word has been used in a workplace , but usually it 's been done between people of different races , and when we 're having that discussion , it seems that it 's clear that if you 're not @entity8 and you use the n - word , absolutely it 's insulting , " @entity141 said			1
@entity16 claimed she was a victim of a pattern of negative comments and that the audio recording was her last stand			2
" this has been a long and arduous journey for me working at @entity17 , and to be belittled and degraded by the founder and to have him justify him disrespecting me was hurtful , " @entity16 said tuesday			2
" so for the jury to make a statement saying that the n - word is not permissible in the workplace and or any business i was happy about that , yes			1
" @entity16 claimed @entity35 targeted her with negative comments after she tried to defend a graduate from a @entity17 program who had allegedly been sexually harassed by a @entity17 employee , according to the complaint			1
after many attempts to have the issued addressed , @entity16 claims @entity35 showed no interest in the allegations and told other employees not to socialize with @entity16 , according to the complaint			2
on april 11 , 2012 , @entity16 sent a formal complaint to @entity168 , the organization 's ceo , telling him of the numerous harassing , discriminatory and retaliatory acts she had endured from @entity35			2
@entity168 said that he did not wish to discuss @entity35 's actions and that @entity16 was being " out of line " and " emotional , " according to the complaint			2
on june 11 , 2012 , @entity168 fired @entity16			0
@entity16 said she was terminated in retaliation for her complaints about the graduate 's sexual harassment and because of her race and gender			0
