before we had " 16 and pregnant , " push - up bras for tweens or mandatory sex education , girls like @entity1 learned about the birds and the bees from author @entity8			1
@entity1 was 11 years old when her aunt gave her a copy of @entity8 's breakthrough novel , " are you there @entity13 ? it 's me , @entity15			1
" she formed an instant bond with 12 - year - old @entity17 who , like her , was embarking upon puberty at a time when people did n't talk openly about boys , bras and periods			2
she had finally found someone she could relate to			0
" i would close my door and the world would fall away , " she said			0
@entity8 's first - person narrative " always connected me with the character because she wrote so close to the heart			1
" believe it or not , it 's been nearly 43 years since " are you there @entity13 ? " jump - started @entity8 's prolific career , which changed the way a generation of readers learned about menstruation , masturbation and sex , among other growing pains			1
though she 's had her critics over the years , @entity8 , who turned 75 this year , can still draw a crowd in this latest chapter of her career , which includes a forthcoming novel and the first major motion picture adaptation of one of her novels -- and it 's not " are you there @entity13 ? " " @entity58 , " which opened june 7 , may not be @entity8 's most popular book , but it 's the one she and son @entity54 ( the inspiration for @entity56 ) had always wanted to bring to the big screen			1
both said they felt a strong connection to lead character @entity61 , a teen whose mother uproots her from @entity64 to visit relatives in @entity66 after her father is killed in an armed robbery			0
plus , it was the only novel they could film in 23 days on a budget that only allowed them to cast three professional actors from outside @entity66 , said @entity54 , who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with his mother			2
still , they managed to pull together a strong cast that included @entity79 , best known for her roles in the @entity81 and @entity82 and former pink power ranger @entity83			0
@entity85 activist @entity84 was cast as the father of @entity87 , who is played by @entity84 ' real - life son , actor @entity88			0
even @entity8 and her husband , the film 's executive producer @entity89 ( who she met while writing the book , dedicating it to him ) , have cameos			1
because of religious themes in the movie and @entity8 's own heritage , the film has shown at @entity98 film festivals including the @entity99 , where it was screened on a sunday afternoon in february			1
for @entity8 's fans , though , it probably did n't matter which film was showing as long as she was there to talk about it			1
a sold - out crowd showed up to the suburban @entity107 movie theater for a screening and q&a of " @entity58 , " many carrying tattered copies of @entity8 's books for her to sign afterward			1
among them was @entity113 , now a 44 - year - old special education teacher with a bookshelf full of first edition @entity8 novels procured via @entity118			1
she arrived two hours early with copies of " are you there @entity13 ? " and " @entity58 " in hand and a purple fabric flower in her hair , a play on the word bloom , she said			1
when her turn came to meet her hero , she got choked up , struggling for words and fighting back tears while her husband gently rubbed her back			0
" i can die happy now , " she said after regaining composure			0
" it 's kind of like meeting a superhero			1
" across the table , @entity8 smiled patiently and nodded her head in the gracious , knowing way of someone who 's used to this sort of thing			1
normally , @entity8 keeps a box of tissues on the table at book signings , she said , keenly aware of her effect on fans			1
usually , they 're mothers and wives , teachers , doctors or cancer survivors ( like @entity8 herself ) in their 20s , 30s , 40s and beyond			2
in her presence , though , they revert to gushing , hand - wringing teens who show their excitement through nervous laughter , professions of adoration or tears			0
" i represent to them something from their childhood , wherever she was in her life when she was reading those books , " @entity8 later said			2
dressed in a sleek black ensemble of straight - legged jeans , fitted leather jacket , short leather boots and patchwork scarf , @entity8 carried herself with the poise and confidence of someone who has spent decades in the public eye writing and talking about herself			2
to answer some of the recurring questions , she maintains a website decorated with cartoon bodies bearing @entity8 's head and containing annotated bibliographies , information on her battle with censorship and tidbits like her favorite color			1
she wears her signature friendly grin whether she 's chatting with a fan or demanding extra lighting for a book signing			2
she does n't hesitate to speak her mind if , say , someone asks her to sign the 1981 unauthorized biography purportedly " based on firsthand information from the writer herself			0
" " i 'm not sure if i want to sign this			0
i did n't even write it ! " she wondered out loud before deciding to acquiesce with the note , " do not believe anything you read in this book ! " the fan apologized , but @entity8 flashed her grin and told her not to worry			1
" do n't be sorry			0
i 'm so glad you came , " she said , beaming			0
@entity8 is evolving with the times in other ways , having cultivated a respectable @entity211 following of more than 82,000 " tweeps " whom she gave out a shout - out to during sunday 's screening			1
she uses @entity211 to share information about screenings and thoughts like how one advantage of turning 75 is that she no longer has to take off her shoes at airport security			2
otherwise , little has changed over the years within the pages of her classics , she said			0
sure , in new editions , @entity15 's sanitary napkin and belt have been replaced with adhesive pads			0
@entity56 , the insufferable younger brother of @entity228 , has new electronics			0
otherwise , the struggles of her protagonists still resonate with her devoted fanbase			0
" i do n't think people change ; electronics change , the things we have change , but the way we live does n't change , " @entity8 said as she waited in the lobby sunday for the screening			2
a few changes were made in transition from novel to film , which became the natural focus of questions after the screening			0
why was the relationship between @entity61 's mother and her nerdy suitor downplayed , one person wondered , or why did @entity61 's aunt became her mother 's sister in the film instead of her father 's sister ? @entity8 and her son assured the audience that changes were made to preserve the film 's narrative flow , which can be challenging in adapting a first - person novel			1
" there 's only so many times she can go to her room and slam the door , " @entity8 told the audience			1
" i think a lot of stuff in the movie is better than the book			0
" she also told the audience that cries a lot when she 's writing , especially if she 's on the right track			0
" i know it 's working when i 'm writing a book if i 'm laughing or crying , " she told the audience during a q&a session after the screening			0
if so , it bodes well for the film , during which she still tears up even though she 's seen it several times			2
audience member @entity286 admitted that she " cried like a baby " during the screening			0
her real reason for showing up was to meet @entity8 for the second time in her life			2
she 'd brought with her a copy of " @entity292 " that @entity8 signed 30 years ago , when the author visited @entity286 's elementary school in @entity295 , @entity296			1
during the book signing , the two shared stories of cancer treatment while @entity8 signed @entity286 's tattered paperback for the second time			1
" glad we 're both still here 30 years later			0
