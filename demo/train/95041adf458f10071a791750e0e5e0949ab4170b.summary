-- by 2050 , minorities will be the majority in @entity3 , and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double , according to projections released thursday by the @entity7			1
the @entity7 looks at 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing , mortality rates and migration			2
minorities , classified as those of any race other than @entity17 , single - race whites , currently constitute about a third of the @entity3 population , according to @entity7 figures			1
but by 2042 , they are projected to become the majority , making up more than half the population			2
by 2050 , 54 percent of the population will be minorities			1
minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner			0
by 2023 , the bureau said , more than half of all children will be minorities			0
" part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups , hispanics in particular , " said @entity29 , chief of the @entity7 's population projection branch , which issued the report			2
" those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age			0
non-hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older			0
" the projections are based on @entity46 results and assumptions about future childbearing , mortality rates and net international migration , the bureau said			0
the group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the @entity54 population			1
it is projected to nearly triple , from 46.7 million to 132.8 million , from 2008 through 2050 , the bureau said			2
its share of the total @entity3 population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent			1
" thus , one in three @entity3 residents would be @entity54 , " the @entity7 said in a news release			1
the @entity61 - @entity3 population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050 , going from 14 percent of the @entity3 population to 15 percent			1
the @entity62 - @entity3 population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million , or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population			1
among the remaining races , the bureau said , @entity3 @entity65 and @entity66 natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million , going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the @entity3 population			1
native @entity70 and @entity69 are expected to more than double , increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million			0
in addition , the number of @entity3 residents identifying themselves as being of two or more races is projected to more than triple , increasing to 16.2 million from its current 5.2 million , the @entity7 said			1
meanwhile , the @entity17 white population is not expected to post dramatic gains in the same period			1
by 2050 , whites are expected to number 203.3 million , slightly increased from the 2008 number of 199.8 million			1
whites will comprise 46 percent of the @entity3 population by 2050 , down from the current level of 66 percent , the bureau said , as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s			1
by 2030 , all baby boomers will be age 65 and older -- comprising nearly 20 percent of @entity3 residents , or one in five @entity3 , the bureau said			1
by 2050 , the 65 - and - older age group will increase to 88.5 million , more than doubling its current number of 38.7 million			1
meanwhile , the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple , from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050			1
non-hispanic whites make up most of the baby boomers , @entity29 said			0
" they 're in a higher mortality rate ... nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster " instead of reproducing at the rate projected for minorities			0
obviously , the projections will have " very strong policy implications , " he said -- medical care for an increasingly elderly population , for instance , educational needs for increasing numbers of minority children and economic effects for the labor force			0
" who 's going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people ? " @entity29 said			0
" all those things are subject to change			0
" the @entity3 is projected to reach the 400 million population milestone in 2039 , according to bureau projections			2
by 2050 , the population is expected to be 439 million			2
of those , 235.7 million are expected to be minorities			0
as @entity3 cities and towns have increasingly become more diverse , @entity7 officials knew the day of a majority minority would come , @entity29 said			2
and " the aging one is sort of simple , " he added			0
" that 's demography 101			0
" other highlights from the report released thursday : by 2050 , 62 percent of the nation 's children will be minorities , up from 44 percent today			0
of those , 39 percent are projected to be @entity54 , up from 22 percent in 2008 , and 38 percent are projected to be white , down from 56 percent in 2008 the percentage of the @entity3 population between the ages of 18 and 64 -- the " working age " population -- is projected to decrease to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008			1
the working - age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039 , and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population			2
by 2050 , the working - age population will be more than 30 percent @entity54 , up from 15 percent in 2008 ; 15 percent @entity61 , up from 13 percent in 2008 ; and 9.6 percent @entity62 , up from 5.3 percent in 2008			1
@entity29 said the timelines are not written in stone			2
" it 's a projection			0
and things like the baby boom generation could n't be predicted			0
" @entity150 changes in policy affecting families and children , or a major policy affecting immigration , could have an impact on the expectations , he said			0
the nation 's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections , @entity29 said			0
@entity7 data includes all @entity3 residents , regardless of their legal status , he said			1
@entity0 's @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
