-- @entity0 asked two contributors , both steeped in the political arts , to give advice to the candidates for wednesday night 's debate			1
here are their thoughts : @entity9 's advice for @entity10 : a quarter - century ago , @entity11 wrote that in a meeting with atomic scientists , president @entity12 quoted @entity15 : " i would rather be ashes than dust , i would rather my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze , than it should be stifled in dry rot			1
i would rather be a superb meteor , with every atom of me in magnificent glow , than a sleepy and permanent planet			2
" the @entity26 followed that powerful poetry with some classic @entity12 common sense			2
he said the @entity30 quarterback @entity29 was asked what @entity32 's lines meant			2
@entity29 replied : " throw deep			2
" how to watch , clip and share the debate that should be @entity10 's strategy in tonight 's debate : throw deep			1
here 's the problem : the one time in his cautious , careful , risk - averse candidacy that @entity10 gambled , he lost			1
putting @entity41 on the ticket has been a disaster			2
@entity41 's budget ideas -- voucherizing @entity45 , privatizing @entity46 , gutting education and giving tax breaks to the rich -- are toxic			0
the @entity50 budget plan has cemented @entity10 's image as @entity52 on a bad day ; @entity54 on a good one			1
opinion : how will debates sway the undecideds ? @entity10 's aides are right when they tell the press a debate is a series of moments , and they are wise to try to craft some moments			1
but they are fools for telling the @entity64 : " ( @entity10 's ) strategy includes luring the president into appearing smug or evasive about his responsibility for the economy			1
" first , let me assure you our president reads the @entity64 and has almost certainly deployed his @entity74 - like mind on avoiding smugness or evasion			0
any strategy that relies on your opponent to err is a hope , not a strategy			0
instead of hoping for president @entity81 to be a jerk , @entity10 should surprise us by being human			1
he should acknowledge the obvious : that his party made a hash of things the last time they ran the economy : squandering the surplus , generating trillions in debt , deregulating @entity90 , waging war on the national credit card			0
opinion : debate is all about trust for @entity10 by pushing off the @entity97 's errors , @entity10 would build credibility as a sensible moderate			1
then , and only then , he could be believable when he attacks the @entity81 economic record			1
breaking with the failed orthodoxy of his own party 's past was something @entity12 was capable of			2
but @entity10 is no @entity12			1
and he 's certainly no @entity29			0
@entity10 was not a quarterback , throwing deep			1
he was , and remains , a cheerleader , furiously praising his team 's efforts			0
even when they have demonstrably failed			0
@entity9 , a @entity108 strategist and @entity0 political contributor , is senior adviser to @entity110 , the biggest super pac favoring president @entity81 's re-election			1
@entity9 was a political consultant for @entity114 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to @entity114 in the @entity116			1
opinion : candidates , stop vying to be debate underdog @entity121 ' advice for @entity81 : mr. president , my advice for you in your debate tomorrow : have a cigarette			1
if i were your advisor , i 'd urge you to remember that you are the president , and we only have one of those			0
a president 's stature is hard to match			0
do n't throw it away by becoming a political attack dog			2
yes , you need a good offense or @entity10 will put you on defense , which you do n't want			1
hey , you 've got a lot that needs defending ! but keep your famous cool and make @entity10 come up to your level			1
@entity141 : how the candidates should eat before the debates remember , a tie goes to the incumbent			0
@entity10 has to make the case for change or @entity148 will keep what they 've got			1
the pressure is on him			0
you tend to get a bit arrogant sometimes			0
at times , you 've even bragged about your modesty			0
debate night is not the time to repeat your suggestion that you might be one of the four greatest presidents in @entity148 history			0
opinion : why debate is crucial for @entity81 , too @entity164 @entity114			2
i know this one sticks in your craw : you do n't believe @entity114 is in your same league			0
remember , however , that his speech at the @entity108 convention was n't just an endorsement , it was a campaign plan			0
tell @entity148 that @entity114 was right , things are getting better and your priority for the next 4 years is reducing the deficit			0
give voters a signal that you wo n't need the @entity108 's left wing after you are re-elected			2
let the center know you may have fooled around with crazy spending your first term , but if re-elected , you 'll be faithful , live on the family budget and settle down at home with them			2
oh yes , and mean it			0
@entity121 , a @entity0 contributor , is a @entity97 consultant and the co-founder of @entity188			1
follow him on @entity189 : @ alexcast			0
