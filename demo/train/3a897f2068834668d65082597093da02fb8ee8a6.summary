@entity0 -- the @entity2 told @entity3 on thursday that the likelihood of a @entity6 - type event in the @entity7 is " very , very small			1
" however , it said an ongoing study of the @entity11 disaster will probably lead to changes to increase safety at the nation 's 104 commercial power plants			1
the commission said , in a nutshell , it expects to require nuclear plants to be prepared for bigger natural disasters , to survive longer power outages and to consider the possibility of simultaneous disasters affecting multiple reactors , as happened in @entity11			1
commissioner @entity24 said one of the lessons of @entity27 is " humility			1
" " i believe that , as a community of safety analysts , we were pretty confident that there would be no new surprises , " @entity24 said			1
" @entity27 has challenged that belief			0
" commissioners said the commission 's core safety concept , a belts - and - suspenders policy called " @entity39 , " is sound			1
the policy requires power plant designers and operators to have multiple , redundant layers of defense to respond to failures so that no single layer of response is relied on			1
they also endorsed support for regulations that require plants to be designed to withstand the strongest natural disasters on record for that location , with an added margin of safety			1
but while voicing support for both concepts , some commissioners said " @entity39 " needs to be deeper and margins of safety wider			1
currently , emergency plans for most @entity7 nuclear reactors envision one nuclear reactor being in danger			0
at @entity27 , all four operating reactors were affected by the tsunami that followed an earthquake in march			0
the @entity2 also requires plans to evacuate a 10 - mile zone around power plants , but @entity7 authorities recommended that @entity7 citizens within 50 miles of @entity27 evacuate			1
@entity11 to hand out radiation meters to children " if there 's an overall lesson we can learn from this , i think that is you ca n't ... predict everything that will happen in the future			1
you ca n't predict every earthquake , every tsunami , but ... you have to be able to recover from whatever happens , " commissioner @entity85 said			1
currently , a @entity2 task force is midway through a 90 - day review of the @entity27 incident , searching for lessons that can quickly be applied to @entity7 plants			1
the 90 - day study , to be released july 19 , will be followed by a lengthier study involving more long - term changes			0
at a hearing before the @entity99 , commissioners discussed some of the lessons learned			1
they include : -- the commission needs to evaluate its " station blackout " rule concerning how power plants deal with the loss of electrical power , commissioner @entity102 said			1
" i think that the commission will probably receive from the task force perhaps some recommendations in this area , " he said			0
-- backup batteries used to power control room functions during blackouts are insufficient , @entity24 said			2
" clearly , the main message from @entity27 is that four hours , or sometimes eight , is not sufficient , " he said			0
" interestingly enough , when the requirement of four or longer hours was put in place , it was actually a conservative estimate			0
( @entity121 ) looked at the time it took to recover @entity124 power ( during a blackout )			2
the average was about two hours , so to be conservative , they doubled it			0
and now we have this accident that shows its very inadequate , so that 's certainly something we have to look into			2
" -- the commission needs to consider the impact that spent - fuel pool problems can have during a larger event , chairman @entity133 said			0
" i think we 've had a singular focus , perhaps , on reactor safety in the event of accidents and not put enough attention into considering the impact of spent fuel pools ( on the response ) , " he said			2
-- the commission needs to consider staging of emergency and back - up equipment			0
after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the commission required plants to stage auxiliary diesel generators near nuclear plants , @entity85 said			2
" we require those units to be just a very short distance away from , say , reactor buildings			0
clearly , if we had those procedures in place and had experienced a @entity27 - type event , that equipment would have been wiped out along with a lot of the other side equipment			0
that was a significant revelation for me and something i think we have to address , " he said			0
-- the commission needs to review first - responder communication capabilities			0
" it 's always very difficult to have communication in a crisis situation , and i think that 's an area that we can always be exercising and improving , " commissioner @entity171 commission			1
commissioners also said the agency must study what led to the hydrogen explosions that plagued @entity27 but said not enough is known about the incident to recommend changes			2
" we 've always asked ourselves the question , ' are the plants still safe ? is there anything we need to do today to address that ? ' and the answer continues to be ' no , ' " @entity133 said			2
" we want to get good information , ( and ) we have time to do that			0
" the likelihood of something like this happening in the @entity7 is still very , very small , because these are really very , very unlikely types of events , " he said			0
@entity133 said the current 90 - day review " may seem like a very long time , ( but ) to the people doing the review , it 's going by in a millisecond			2
" " but it 's important that we get it right , and i think that so far , they are looking at all the right things , " he said .			0

commissioners tell @entity3 of potential changes to power plants
" humility " among lessons of @entity11 's disaster , commissioner says
they say the present core safety concept is sound
