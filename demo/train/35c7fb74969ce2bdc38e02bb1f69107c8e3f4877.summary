-- it 's a casting " x " - gravaganza ! director @entity3 tweeted tuesday that @entity4 and @entity5 will be reprising their respective roles as @entity8 and prof. x in " x-men : @entity11 , " and they 'll be joined by " x-men : @entity17 " stars @entity15 as @entity8 and @entity16 as prof. x. wait , what ? for the geek uninitiated , " @entity11 " is also the title of an @entity10 comic book storyline from 1981 , which alternated between a dystopian future in which mutants are living in internment camps , and the present day mutants working to prevent that future from happening			1
@entity0 : @entity3 will direct ' x-men : @entity11 ' with this casting news , @entity3 has all but confirmed that the next @entity10 film will reconstitute that storyline a bit , making the @entity15 / @entity16 mutants in the go - go 1960s the " present day " storyline , and the @entity4 / @entity5 mutants in the early 21st century the ones trapped in a bleak alternate future			1
this is likely a way back to the series for @entity5 , given that his prof. @entity1 was ( more or less ) killed off in 2006â € ²s " x-men : @entity42			1
" curiously , @entity3 also officially announced that " x-men : @entity17 's " @entity44 and @entity45 are also returning as @entity46 and @entity47 , respectively			0
does this mean @entity49 and @entity50 will be playing their 21st century counterparts ? all @entity3 would say in his final tweet : " more to come ... " @entity0 : all time great comic book movies this also officially means that @entity4 is set to go up against himself : both " x-men : @entity11 " and " @entity56 : @entity56 " are scheduled to hit theaters on july 18 , 2014			2
