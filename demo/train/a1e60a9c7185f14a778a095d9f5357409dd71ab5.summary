@entity0 -- several key @entity3 senators on wednesday tore into private contractors working in @entity5 for the company formerly known as @entity7 , accusing them of flouting regulations and endangering the @entity3 mission			1
one of the keys to beating the @entity11 in @entity5 is the ability of @entity3 forces to win support from the @entity5 people , many of whom do not distinguish between @entity3 contractors and the @entity3 military , sen. @entity20 , @entity21 , said during a @entity23 hearing			1
a top executive at @entity7 , the new name for @entity7 , acknowledged past mistakes on the part of the company 's contractors			1
he asserted in testimony before the committee that the company is now " reformed " and operates " with a different approach			1
" @entity20 , the chairman of the @entity23 , said that if the @entity3 is going to win the war in @entity5 , " we need to know that our contractor personnel are adequately screened , supervised , and held accountable -- because in the end the @entity5 people will hold us responsible for their actions			1
" he also warned that " if we do n't fix the problems of oversight and make sure contractors like @entity7 play by the rules and live up to their commitments -- we 'll be doing a disservice to our troops by making their already difficult and dangerous job even more so			1
" sen. @entity49 , @entity50 , said the @entity3 mission is experiencing setbacks because of the lack of oversight of military contractors			1
" we have two sets of rules and one image , " she said			0
until that changes , " we 're going to continue to be stalled on progress in terms of accomplishing this mission			0
" the committee 's top @entity63 , @entity66 sen. @entity65 , agreed with @entity20 's and @entity49 's assessment			1
" given the stakes and the primary focus of our counterinsurgency strategy to protect the @entity5 people , we must not tolerate gross misbehavior or criminal misconduct by individual civilian contractor employees , " @entity65 said			1
" we can not afford to tolerate lax oversight by the government entities directly responsible for policing these companies and civilian employees in @entity5			2
" though more than 100,000 contractors operate for a variety of contractors in @entity5 , the senators singled out @entity7 , a company with " no meaningful distinction " from @entity7 , @entity20 said			1
@entity20 cited a december 9 , 2008 , shooting at the @entity3 military 's range at @entity85 during which a @entity7 program manager carrying an @entity86 got on the back of a moving car , then shot and wounded a @entity7 trainer on his team when the car hit a bump , @entity20 said			2
though the program manager lost his job , the others on his team who allowed his activities did not , he said			0
combined @entity99 , a multinational military formation that trains the @entity101 , did not appear to have investigated the incident , he said			0
had it done so , the @entity108 " would have seen that @entity7 personnel were using weapons improperly and unsafely , with inadequate supervision , and that they were carrying weapons that they were n't even supposed to have , " according to @entity20			1
he also cited a widely reported may 5 , 2009 , incident in which two @entity7 personnel fired their weapons , killing two @entity5 civilians and wounding a third			2
the two men have been charged with murder in connection with the shootings			0
an @entity101 investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had " violated alcohol consumption policies , were not authorized to possess weapons , violated use - of - force rules and violated movement - control policies , " said @entity20 , who cited as his source the man who then led the @entity126			2
@entity7 's contract required it to " ensure that its personnel ... behave at all times in accordance with the highest professional and ethical standards , " he added			1
records for the two men responsible for the may 5 shooting show the company failed to properly vet them , @entity20 said			2
one man 's military record " apparently included assault , insubordinate conduct , absence without leave , failure to obey order or regulation , larceny and wrongful appropriation , " he said			2
and his criminal record showed convictions for reckless driving , disturbing the peace , assault and battery , driving while intoxicated , resisting arrest and trespassing			0
the other man was cited in a news report for having been discharged from the @entity3 military after being absent without leave for 22 days and testing positive for cocaine , @entity20 said			0
other @entity7 personnel were fired for alcohol use and drug use , he said			2
during his opening statement before the committee , @entity7 vice president @entity165 acknowledged the company 's culpability in the incident			1
" the independent contractors ' actions that night clearly violated company policies against use of alcohol , unauthorized use of official vehicles , and taking weapons outside the training area , " he said			1
" those contractors are being held accountable by the law , as they should be			2
" @entity165 also noted that three individuals involved in the may 2009 shootings had been relieved of their responsibilities prior to the incident			0
he conceded , however , that " @entity7 's policies and procedures were not followed because of failures by @entity7 's prior management			2
" @entity7 's " leadership reported to me at the time , and i accept my share of the responsibility , " he said			2
" that leadership and company director failed to keep me adequately informed that well - established , basic policies and practices were not being followed			1
" @entity165 , in his statement , told the committee members that " the new @entity7 would act differently today			2
we simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon ( where needed ) and without full compliance with all requirements			2
" he said the company has " put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept			0
" after the shootings , @entity209 , which had subcontracted the work to @entity7 , accused the company of having failed to properly oversee its personnel			1
@entity7 responded that it would need more money to do that , @entity20 said , calling the company 's response " deeply troubling " since its contractual obligation already called for that			1
in addition , @entity7 called its personnel " independent contractors , " despite " compelling evidence " that they were company employees , @entity20 said			1
that meant that the company withheld no income taxes and paid no @entity228 , @entity229 , or unemployment tax for them , he said			0
the @entity231 is currently considering @entity7 's classification			0
@entity20 also took to task the @entity108 for " apparent lack of contractor oversight			1
" before last may 's shooting , the @entity101 said it had no contracting officer representative in the area , telling the committee that it relied on a @entity241 contractor to oversee the project			1
the @entity101 said it also monitored the contractors from an office in @entity245 by calling the chief of training and education for the @entity249 at @entity126			0
but the chief has told the committee that he did not travel to the training sites to observe @entity7 's personnel , @entity20 said			1
on december 3 , 2008 , prior to the first shooting incident , @entity209 told the @entity101 by e-mail that @entity7 workers had weapons without authority , @entity20 said , but the @entity101 " apparently failed to take action			0
" @entity209 issued a statement wednesday in response to the hearing			0
" the contract for these services , including sub-contracting support , was addressed through a competitive bidding , evaluation and selection process that involved our customer			0
@entity7 employees subsequently violated policies of their contract which led to our termination of the relationship for cause last year			0
" @entity209 has been working closely with our customers to enhance controls , procedures and oversight of contractor and subcontractor personnel			1
we will continue to work with our customers to ensure that strong oversight supports the success of our training services programs , " the statement said			0
a separate report released earlier this month by the inspectors general of the @entity290 and the @entity291 criticizes the @entity291 for its oversight of @entity5 training contracts , specifically a $ 1 billion contract to train @entity295			0
the @entity291 failed to keep track of the money and materials , including weapons , and failed to prepare the police to fight off insurgents , the report said			0
additionally , @entity20 said a key mission of @entity3 forces in @entity5 is to train and equip @entity5 security forces to take the lead in the war , adding that they use a @entity3 - operated facility near @entity309 to store weapons for the @entity5 forces			0
though no policy exists that allows contractors or subcontractors to use weapons stored at the site , called @entity321 22 , @entity7 personnel " acquired several hundred weapons , including more than 500 @entity86 , from the facility on multiple occasions , " @entity20 said			1
though the company said last june that it had returned them all , @entity20 said that was not the case , citing one @entity86 that was not returned until late last month			0
" these are weapons that belonged to the @entity295 -- not @entity7 , " he said			0
" and it is only on the eve of this hearing that the company is giving the majority of them back to the @entity5 government			0
" @entity20 concluded his opening remarks by saying that the contractors need to understand that they have an impact on how the @entity3 military is perceived			0
" even one irresponsible act by contractor personnel can hurt the mission and put our troops in harm 's way , " he said			1
