@entity0 -- the world 's oldest person has died in @entity4 , aged 116 -- just days after the passing of a @entity7 woman with a rival claim to the title			1
@entity11 , a former postman , died of natural causes in hospital in his hometown of @entity15 , western @entity4 , in the early hours of wednesday , city officials told @entity1			1
in december , @entity11 had been recognized by @entity16 as the world 's oldest living person , and as the oldest man whose age had ever been verified			1
" i wanted him to live longer , " his nephew , @entity21 , told @entity4 television network @entity23			2
" his life was respectable ; i would like to say ' thank you ' to him			0
" @entity11 , who attributed his longevity to eating light , healthy meals , worked for the post office until his retirement in 1962 , continuing to carry out agricultural work until the age of 90			1
only the third man in history verified to have reached the age of 115 , @entity11 had seven children , 14 grandchildren , 25 great - grand children and 14 great - great grandchildren			2
on his passing , the mantle of oldest living person passes to fellow @entity4 @entity45 , a 115 - year old woman from @entity47			2

@entity59 , from the remote village of @entity58 , had an official id card and residency permit -- both issued in recent decades -- stating she was born in 1885 , making her 127			2
in 2010 , a @entity7 state - sponsored research institute claimed to have verified the documents			0
but her claim to record longevity was not officially recognized internationally , due to questions over of the reliability of birth records when she was born , and because of claims she had given birth to the youngest of her five children aged 61			1
on tuesday , @entity59 's son @entity77 told @entity78 that his mother had died at the weekend after months of illness , aged 127			1
