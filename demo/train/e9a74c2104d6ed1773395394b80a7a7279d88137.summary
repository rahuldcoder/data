-- a few hours before he announced the death of @entity4 president @entity3 , vice president @entity1 repeated the claim that @entity3 's fatal illness was caused by outsiders , and he labeled the opposition the " enemy of the nation			1
" with that , he gave voice to one of the principal legacies of the @entity3 era , one of divisiveness and scapegoating			1
the @entity3 legacy , however , includes much more than animosity between rich and poor , between left and right			1
@entity3 played a pivotal role in bringing the plight of @entity24 's impoverished people to the top of the political agenda			1
it was as if the former paratrooper grabbed a continent by the lapels and shouted " you must fight against poverty ! " and the continent listened			0
even the people who vehemently disagreed with @entity3 's neosocialist , populist ideology realized that economic inequality required urgent attention			1
in the years after he came to power , aggressive anti-poverty programs have been launched in a number of @entity24 countries , with impressive success			0
@entity3 improved the lot of the poor in @entity4 , and he had an impact on the reduction of inequality elsewhere in the region			1
but in the process , he deeply undermined @entity4 democracy , and he created a model of authoritarianism that other autocrats copied , harming democracy in many countries			1
his anti-american , anti-opposition policies gained credence at home when the opposition staged a coup attempt in 2002 that @entity3 said was supported by the @entity63 his histrionic pretense that he could " smell sulfur " when he took the podium after " the devil " @entity72 at the @entity73 , turned him into a global media superstar , and a prominent player in an anti-washington alliance with @entity68 's regime			1
he provided a lifeline to the @entity77 regime in @entity78 , and ostentatiously made friends with @entity24 's foes , such as @entity82 's @entity81 and @entity84 's @entity83			2
the social programs he developed brought housing and health care , and they helped feed the poor			2
he helped raise living standards and inspired millions of passionate supporters			0
the intensity of support was regularly stoked by the constant attacks against the rich , " the oligarchs , " as he called them , and the @entity63 , or " the empire			1
" but the unorthodox economic methods of his " 21st century socialism " and his " @entity100 " revolution , distorted the economy and , in fact , created less economic growth and less prosperity than other countries in @entity24			0
and a strong case has been made that @entity4 , a country with enormous oil wealth , should have grown far more than it did during the @entity3 years , when businesses were regularly confiscated by the government and the vital oil industry was put in the hands of political supporters instead of technical experts			1
the economic legacy is one of sky - high inflation , chronic shortages and dried up investment			0
@entity4 's economy has grown , but more slowly than that of @entity122 , @entity123 or @entity124 , probably more slowly than it might have			1
on the political front , @entity3 empowered the poor , making them rightly feel that they mattered in system that had been controlled by the rich			1
but before long , he manipulated the system to a degree that democracy started thinning to little more than a brittle veneer			2
@entity3 unsuccessfully tried to take power through a coup attempt in 1992			1
in 1999 , he won the presidency at the ballot box			0
he kept the top job until the day he died			0
immediately after taking office , he convened a constitutional assembly			0
the new constitution mandated a maximum of two terms in office			0
he called elections again and won a second time , counting that as the start of his two terms			0
after winning the presidency for a third time in 2006 , he called a referendum abolishing the presidential term limit and said he might remain president until 2030			0
he won for a fourth time last year			0
had mortality not interfered , @entity3 could have become the eternal president			1
that manipulation of the electoral system has been one of the most pernicious legacies of @entity161			0
in @entity166 , for example , president @entity164 , facing a constitutionally mandated end to his presidency , took a page from the @entity3 playbook , packing the @entity169 , which ruled that term limits do not apply to the president			2
other @entity24 presidents have imitated @entity3 populist undemocratic style , intimidating opponents , restricting the media and subverting the judiciary			2
@entity177 documented the steady erosion of democratic freedoms over the 14 years of @entity3 's tenure , concluding that @entity3 and his supporters built " a system in which the government has free rein to threaten and punish @entity4 who interfere with their political agenda , creating ever greater risks for judges , journalists and human rights activists			1
" @entity3 and his backers took over practically all the levers of power , all the while claiming democratic legitimacy			2
they allowed the opposition to continue functioning , which along with the @entity63 provided them with a foil to blame for the country 's woes			1
the judiciary , in particular , became a tool of the government , used for political purposes even as the crime rates spiraled , homicide rates reached unprecedented levels and most crimes went unsolved			0
the government decided to stop keeping crime statistics , but one private organization counted more than 118,000 homicides since @entity3 took office			2
experts said one of the problems was the justice system , which , like other parts of government , had become more political than professional			0
in one infamous case , judge @entity221 granted bail to a banker charged with breaking currency controls while he awaited trial			0
in his weekly television show , @entity3 declared " the judge has to pay ! " she spent three years in a jail where , she said , she was raped , awaiting trial on trumped - up corruption charges			2
@entity3 shut down critical media outlets and threatened others with closure , refusing to renew broadcast licenses of some of his most powerful critics			2
in recent years , the appeal of @entity161 started waning in @entity24			0
other less divisive , more democratic , and more effective approaches became more popular			0
with @entity3 off the stage in @entity4 , a number of questions hang in the air			1
the acrimony of his rule has left a dangerously divided @entity4 facing serious social and economic challenges , with the latest accusations by @entity1 adding fuel to those hot embers			2
@entity3 leaves behind a country where the poor have been empowered and society has been divided , and a continent where alternatives to his model look more appealing than ever			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			0

she says in the process of helping the poor , he undermined his nation 's democracy
