-- @entity3 's @entity2 continued to carve away share of worldwide browser usage from rivals in may , new statistics show			1
@entity2 rose 0.3 percentage points to 7.1 percent of share , said @entity9 , which monitors browser usage on a network of web sites			1
the statistics reflect activity , not the number of people using a browser , as people load up about 160 million pages each month on sites @entity9 monitors			1
because web usage is increasing , the absolute number of people using a browser can increase even as its fractional share of usage drops			1
the share losses came from @entity30 's @entity29 , which dropped 0.3 percent to 59.7 percent , and @entity32 's @entity31 , which dropped 0.2 percentage points to 24.4 percent			1
fourth - place @entity34 from @entity35 rose 0.1 percentage points to 4.8 percent , and @entity37 rose 0.1 percentage points to 2.4 percent			1
the browser market has become hotly competitive with new features being built in to support new web standards			0
even @entity30 , long considered a technology laggard even as its browser dominated , is back in the game with aggresive work developing @entity47			2
@entity30 has been trying to rid the world of @entity49 , introduced in 2001 and now considered outmoded , slow , and insecure			1
even though @entity29 lost share overall , @entity30 can point to progress in upgrading : the various versions of @entity53 accounted for 28.9 percent of usage			1
meanwhile , another analytics firm , @entity55 , reported ie6 use had dropped below 5 percent in the @entity57 and @entity58 and to 9.8 percent worldwide			2
" at these levels , web developers now have valid justification not to support @entity49 in the future , " @entity55 chief executive @entity59 said in a statement			2
the company collected its data from 15 billion page views of web pages in may			0
net applications also released statistics for @entity73 use , showing gradual gains since the @entity35 tablet 's release			0
with the @entity73 now for sale internationally , usage peaked may 29 with 0.17 percent			2
net applications ' data shows the @entity73 is relatively popular on the weekend			0
use generally is lowest as a fraction of browsing on monday , climbs gradually as the weekdays progress , than roughly doubles on the weekend days			0
the company also tracked mobile - phone browsing usage			0
@entity85 , a mobile phone version of the technology from @entity87 and now owned by @entity88 , took the top spot with 40 percent of usage share			2
