-- have you looked at the @entity2 lately ? it 's a giant mess , with civil wars , massive popular protests , cross-border fighting , armed insurgencies , exploding car bombs and on and on			1
and that 's just in the past few days			2
the @entity2 refuses to acknowledge that the @entity10 has decided to pivot toward @entity11			1
it refuses to step out of the spotlight			0
what we see today is proof that long - standing notions about the region -- the old conspiracy theories , the oversimplifications -- were just not true			2
claims that the world paid attention to the area only because it had oil or that the key to every single problem in the @entity2 involved @entity28 have been proved wrong			1
the @entity2 still monopolizes the attention of diplomats , forces military experts urgently back to their drawing boards , keeps world leaders awake at night and would do so even if it did not hold a drop of oil or if the @entity37 - @entity28 conflict did not exist			1
why ? the @entity2 stands , as it has for centuries , at the center of historical currents and conflicting ideologies			1
what goes on there reverberates across national borders and leaps over oceans			0
when ( most of ) you attend religious services on the weekend or when you take off your shoes before boarding an airplane , you do it because of an idea that was born in the @entity2			2
the region is in crisis because it suffers from endemic corruption , poor governance , discrimination against women and serious economic problems			2
rival philosophies are battling for the future -- shiites competing with @entity69 , advocates of democracy challenging dictators , @entity61 trying to overpower pluralists and @entity63 concerned over their future			1
those are just a few of the ingredients fueling the conflicts			0
democracy supporters may have become more muscular , but other determined fighters aspire to create profoundly anti-woman , anti-liberal and anti-american states			0
the implications of those beliefs will become evident as history unfolds			0
for @entity10 , the full pivot will have to wait			0
consider the recent fighting in @entity87 , dramatic developments in @entity89 , slaughter in @entity91 , multiple bombings in @entity82 , or the @entity84 bid at the @entity85			1
on the front burner : @entity89 the streets of @entity94 are boiling with rage against president @entity96 , who stunned the country -- and the @entity98 -- when he announced he was taking powers in what many view as a return to dictatorship			2
protesters worry about a creeping power grab by the @entity106			0
one respected @entity37 observer compared @entity96 to @entity109 's @entity108			1
@entity96 insists his move is necessary and only temporary			0
eventually we will find out who is right			0
the answer will help set the future of democracy in the @entity37 world , where @entity89 leads in ideological , political and cultural trends			1
that 's why when @entity89 picked up the flame from a popular uprising in @entity123 two years ago , every dictator in the region trembled			1
every @entity125 capital had to review its strategic alliances			0
@entity109 the @entity10 might want to focus on @entity11 , but it can not stop worrying about @entity109			1
some will insist the concern is about oil , but the @entity10 could still buy oil from a nuclear - armed @entity109			2
@entity130 , and the world , fears @entity109 's nuclear program will trigger a nuclear arms race in the most politically unstable part of the planet			1
on wednesday , the head of @entity109 's @entity137 vowed that @entity109 will accelerate enriching uranium , despite harsh international sanctions			1
separately , @entity10 officials told @entity0 that @entity141 is already finding ways to ship weapons to the @entity84 @entity145 group @entity144 in @entity87 , just days after the @entity10 helped broker a cease - fire between @entity144 and @entity28			1
israelis and @entity84 this conflict remains a neuralgic point in the region and a challenge to @entity10 influence			2
@entity144 vows to destroy @entity28 , while the @entity153 refuses to sit down for talks , laying the blame at @entity28 's feet			2
defying @entity159 's wishes , the authority took its case to the @entity161 on thursday , where an automatic majority of @entity37 , @entity106 and @entity164 countries guaranteed a positive response to its upgraded status request			0
the move unhelpfully delinks the process of gaining statehood from the need to reach a negotiated peace			0
@entity91 in @entity91 , some 40,000 men women and children have died in the country 's civil war			1
the rebels are making gains in their very worthy cause of overthrowing the repressive regime of @entity181			0
but the @entity182 , including the @entity10 , worries about what might come after @entity181 's fall			0
the opposition includes progressive advocates of democracy , but it also counts all manner of other ideologies , from mild islamists to extremists who would like to see @entity91 as part of a supranational @entity61 caliphate			1
@entity159 looks confused about what to do , but it can not afford to ignore what is happening			0
it would be nice if the @entity10 president could decide which regions will command his attention			0
but this is the @entity2 , and like it or not , it promises to remain at or near the top of the agenda			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity207 : @entity130 trying to pivot to @entity11 , but @entity2 chaos stays center stage
why ? she says region long at the center of historical currents and conflicting ideologies
there 's a battle for the future in @entity89 , @entity109 , @entity91 , @entity28 and with the @entity84 , she says
@entity221 : fight is dictators **vs.** democracy ; pluralists **vs.** @entity61 ; women do *n't* fare well
