-- a @entity2 judge ruled monday that a then 10 - year - old boy committed second - degree murder -- and knew what he was doing was wrong -- when he fatally shot his father , a local @entity7 leader			1
@entity8 was asleep on a couch in his family 's @entity11 home when his son killed him on may 1 , 2011 , according to authorities			1
@entity0 is not naming the boy , who is now 12 , because he is a juvenile			0
@entity8 had been the @entity16 regional director for the @entity17 , according to an online tribute to him from the group 's leader , @entity17			1
one of the nation 's biggest , most well - known @entity7 organizations , the @entity17 idolizes @entity23 and touts virulent rhetoric against those who are @entity26 , immigrants and not " pure - blood whites , " according to the @entity29 civil rights group			1
prosecutors contend the victim 's @entity7 background is not linked to his death , saying the young killer 's concerns about abuse and his family being split up were more significant factors			1
" it was our belief that this would have happened even if ( @entity8 ) was not part of the @entity17 , " said @entity39 , a spokesman for the @entity11 district attorney 's office			1
" this was done more on a domestic level			0
" according to an arrest warrant issued for @entity8 's wife , @entity48 , and posted from the @entity50 's website , @entity11 police arrived in may 2011 at what they described as a " filthy , " unkempt home and found the victim dead on the coach " with a gunshot wound to the left side of his head			2
" five children -- ages 10 , 9 , 7 , 3 and a 2 - month old -- were inside the home at the time , as was @entity48 , the warrant said			0
three of the children later told a detective they knew where guns were inside the house , according to the arrest warrant			0
the eldest said he 'd taken a revolver off a low shelf in his father 's and stepmother 's closet , then killed his sleeping father			1
the boy told police " he was tired of his dad hitting him and his mom , " and that he thought his father was having an affair that might contribute to the family 's break - up			1
less than three weeks after @entity8 's death , @entity48 was arrested and charged with five counts of willful child endangerment and four counts of criminal storage of a firearm , according to @entity91 records			2
in august 2011 , she pleaded guilty to one count of each charge and was sentenced to 120 days in custody ( all but two of them in work release ) and four years of probation			0
the boy has been detained in juvenile halls in @entity11 since the shooting			0
his lawyers initially sought an insanity defense but later dropped that approach and argued their client did n't fully grasp the ramifications of what he did , according to @entity39 , the district attorney 's spokesman			2
the murder trial before county judge @entity111 -- and not a jury -- got underway october 30 , 2012 , continuing off - and - on for about 10 days over four months , ending monday			1
as there are no " guilty " or " not guilty " verdicts in her @entity2 juvenile court , @entity111 instead found it " true " that the boy had committed murder and understood his actions were wrong			1
the next hearing in the case is scheduled for february 15 , where placement of the boy will be determined			0
the convicted boy could remain in custody up until his 23rd birthday , though he could be freed sooner or have a number of other living arrangements as determined by the judge , said @entity39			2
@entity132 recalled the 32 - year - old victim -- pictured on the tribute website raising a @entity17 flag , which contains a swastika -- as a " dedicated father " who " spent countless hours on the @entity2 and @entity139 border leading patrols in efforts to halt illegal immigration , ( and organized ) events for the @entity17 countless times			2
" @entity132 's ex-wife @entity146 told the @entity29 that @entity8 was her ex-husband 's best friend			0
the same civil rights group described @entity8 as " something of a rising star in the neo-nazi universe			0
" a public advocate for a " white nation , " he led rallies full of white supremacists giving @entity157 salutes at a day - laborer center and synagogues , in addition to his border patrol activities , according to the law center			0
he was also a politician of sorts , earning nearly 30 % of the vote -- after he 'd publicly stood by his neo-nazi views -- in a race to join the @entity169 board of directors in @entity11 .			0

a boy , then 10 , fatally shot his father in 2011 as he was sleeping on a couch
the father was a leader in the @entity17 , a @entity7 group
prosecutors argued domestic issues , not the dad 's background , led to death
a judge finds it " true " the boy committed murder and understood it was wrong
