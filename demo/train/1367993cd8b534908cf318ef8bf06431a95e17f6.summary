on monday , the @entity3 released a summary of the charges that could lead to @entity3 owners voting to strip @entity5 and his wife , @entity15 , of the franchise they have co-owned for 33 years			1
in it , the @entity3 said : " in the course of the investigation into mr. @entity5 's conduct , it was discovered that relevant evidence was destroyed , false and misleading evidence was provided to the @entity3 's investigator , and @entity7 issued a false and misleading press statement regarding this matter			1
" the @entity1 reported that the @entity3 document it obtained alleges @entity5 and @entity8 met on may 2 , about a week after the recording containing racist remarks was released by @entity30 and just before @entity8 was interviewed by @entity31 on @entity32			1
" @entity5 asked @entity8 to tell the @entity3 that she lied in her previous meeting with the league , " the @entity1 reported			1
the newspaper also reported the @entity3 is prepared to argue at a june 3 meeting of the @entity3 board of governors that evidence shows that @entity5 and his wife are not estranged and that she helped prepare the team 's press release after the recordings were aired			1
team president @entity43 also was in on the drafting of the statement that questioned the validity of the recording and suggested it was released by someone seeking revenge against @entity5 , according to the newspaper 's account of the @entity3 document			1
the @entity1 report also said the @entity3 suggested @entity43 heard the recording on april 9 , weeks before it went online , after a @entity7 employee sent @entity43 a @entity56 document says @entity43 told the employee to delete the audio file and text messages about it from a cell phone			1
@entity43 is now on indefinite leave from the team			0
the paper said @entity5 's lawyer , @entity65 , did n't respond to a request for comment			2

@entity3 charges @entity76 , schedules june 3 vote @entity3 commissioner feels certain league will oust @entity76 @entity68 said on tuesday he is confident the league will be able to force the @entity76 to sell the franchise for violating the @entity3 constitution			1
but , the new commissioner said , he would prefer the @entity76 sell the team without the league 's pushing			1
the chances of that happening appear unlikely			0
@entity5 , through his lawyer , has sent a letter to the league saying he wo n't pay a $ 2.5 million fine and threatening to sue if he is n't afforded due process			1
@entity90 has said she wants to maintain her 50 % stake in the franchise			0
" it is their team to sell , " @entity68 , who has been commissioner for three months , said ahead of the league 's draft lottery			1

@entity68 also addressed @entity0 's question about a report that @entity5 demanded a three - month extension , saying the 80 - year - old owner needed to abide by the @entity3 constitution , which puts a firm timeline on the process of removing an ownership group			1
in order to terminate the @entity76 ' franchise rights , 75 % ( 23 ) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale			1
because @entity5 is banned from any @entity3 activities , he is not allowed to vote , but the @entity7 will have a vote , the @entity3 said			1
in the case of a forced sale , the league does have a duty to the @entity76 to sell the team for the highest possible price , @entity68 said			1
the commissioner told reporters if it gets to that point , the league will hire investment bankers to conduct the sale			1
the league said it has been damaged by @entity5 's racist remarks to @entity8 , which were posted online in april by @entity30 and aired in an interview with @entity0 's " @entity145 360			2
" @entity68 expressed confidence that eventually a new group will own the @entity7 , who , led by all - stars @entity149 and @entity150 , advanced to the second round of the @entity3 playoffs this season before losing to the @entity153			2
some analysts have said the team could be worth more than $ 1 billion			0
@entity157 lists the franchise 's value at $ 575 million			0
" we know we 're doing the right thing and i know i have the owners behind me , " @entity68 said			0

jews , when they get successful , they will help their people			0
and some of the african - americans , maybe i 'll get in trouble again , they do n't want to help anybody , " said @entity5 , who is @entity183			2
some owners said privately -- and @entity189 owner @entity188 said publicly -- after the scandal first unfolded that it would be difficult to vote on removing an owner for a personal conversation			0
@entity0 's @entity193 told @entity145 on monday that his interview has changed some minds , according to @entity3 insiders she had spoken with in the past week			2
" if there were any owners who were concerned about should we be kicking someone out for a private tape , ( they ) now feel more comfortable , " she said			0
