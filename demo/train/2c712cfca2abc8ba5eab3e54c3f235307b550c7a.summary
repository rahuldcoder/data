-- reports of yet another outbreak on a cruise ship this week have some imminent cruisers asking the unpleasant question : what are the chances of spending my vacation in the bathroom ? " my mother , who is a first - time cruiser , is seriously reconsidering our choice for our family vacation , " wrote @entity0 reader @entity11 in an e-mail			1
the @entity19 student is booked on a carnival cruise with her family in march			2
the @entity22 is investigating two recent norovirus outbreaks at sea			1
one outbreak hit @entity27 's @entity26 , infecting more 600 passengers and crew			2
the other struck a @entity32 ship , which cut short its seven - day @entity34 itinerary after more than 180 passengers and crew members fell ill. the cause has not yet been determined			2
not exactly tropical drinks by the cruise ship 's pool , lovely walks by the moonlight and port visits to exotic climes			1
and just the thought of wasting precious vacation time has worker - bee bystanders riled up : so glad it 's not me ! poor suckers ! and cruise skeptics who have never been on cruises have another opportunity to ask : what were they thinking ? " i think they are floating germ kingdoms			2
disgusting , " wrote @entity59 of @entity60 , @entity61 , via e-mail			0
" never been on a cruise because of that exact reason			2
" cruising represents one of travel 's deeper divides			0
love it or hate it , most of the keenest objections are only half true -- or false , depending on how you look at it			0
floating petri dishes ? cruise ships are ripe for spreading illness			1
outbreaks of norovirus , the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the @entity82 , occur most frequently in close quarters , according to the @entity22			1
nursing homes , dormitories and cruise ships are common transmission grounds			1
in 2013 , the @entity22 's @entity87 logged nine gastroenteritis outbreaks aboard ships , seven of which had a confirmed cause of norovirus			1
about 1,200 cruise passengers were affected by those norovirus cases			1
to put those figures in perspective , the industry 's @entity96 says more than 10 million passengers embarked on @entity96 - member cruise ships from a @entity82 port in 2012			1
meanwhile , nationwide , norovirus sickens an estimated 21 million people in the @entity82 every year , according to the @entity22			1
bottom line : more people are getting sick on land			2
( granted , that 's little comfort if you 're vomiting violently at sea )			0
more outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been reported aboard cruise ships since 2001 , according to @entity22 statistics			1
the government agency says the spike is tied to an increase in both passengers and ships sailing the seas as well as an overall increase in norovirus outbreaks			1
" there are attempts to control these types of outbreaks , but it 's hard to guarantee that it 's not going to happen for any particular cruise , " said dr. @entity124 , director of the @entity125 at @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128			1
so yes , the threat of illness is real			0
yet the number of reported outbreaks among thousands of annual sailings has ranged in recent years from less than a dozen affected sailings to about three dozen			2
who 's responsible for the outbreak ? " though the cruise lines may get the bad rap for an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness , cruise lines typically do a masterful job of cleaning and disinfecting the ships before , during , and after passengers set sail , " said @entity145 , marketing professor at @entity147 's @entity146			1
that 's because the stakes are so high			0
" it 's more likely that the cause of these outbreaks is us -- or what technology professionals refer to as " ' user error , ' " he said			2
" we might not be feeling tip - top when we board the ship and instead bring illness on - board with us rather than saying , ' maybe i should do this another time			0
' no one wants to cancel a vacation , especially if it 's nonrefundable			0
" @entity145 's solution : buy travel insurance , which is intended for just this kind of problem , and stay home if you 're sick			0
the recent outbreaks are n't scaring away some travelers			1
" i feel for the people who are suffering through it , but for the number of cruises per year and the sheer number of people on them , outbreaks like this are just too small for me to worry about , " wrote @entity184 of @entity185 , @entity186 , via e-mail , who took a cruise in september			1
are ships or passengers unsanitary ? @entity201 , the most common cruise ship outbreak offender , spreads quickly from person to person but can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces			1
the @entity22 's @entity87 conducts regular unannounced inspections of cruise ships			1
@entity26 , the @entity27 ship currently experiencing an outbreak , scored a 98 out of 100 on its last inspection in july 2013			2
" something like this is not representative of an unclean ship , " said @entity212 , managing editor of @entity213			0
" it does n't mean this particular vessel was unclean			0
it just means there was an outbreak on board			0
they 're ending the cruise two days early and doing a really deep cleaning of the ship			2
it 's not likely to happen on the same ship again			0
" unlikely , but not unheard of : @entity32 ' @entity229 had norovirus outbreaks on two consecutive sailings in 2012			1
in 2010 , the @entity22 issued a four - day no - sail recommendation for a @entity234 ship after three consecutive outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness			1
the deep cleaning upon @entity26 ' return to port " will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue , " @entity27 said			2
wash your hands ! cruise lines activate @entity22 - monitored response plans when outbreaks are detected			1
measures include increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfection , isolating ill people , distributing information about proper hand - washing and hygiene as well as illness updates and regular reporting to @entity260 officials			0
hygiene is extremely important when outbreaks occur			0
proper hand washing , avoiding contact with ill passengers and direct contact with public surfaces such as restroom door handles can help stem the spread of highly contagious illness			0
the @entity22 offers health tips for cruisers on its website			0
@entity276 cruiser @entity274 and her husband wo n't be changing their plans for an upcoming sailing on @entity27 's @entity281			0
norovirus : the most common stomach bug " it is not the cruise line 's fault			1
it is a passenger who came onboard sick and spread the virus everywhere			0
on every cruise i have been on , the crew is diligent in keeping things clean and making passengers use hand sanitizer , " @entity290 , of @entity291 , @entity292 , wrote in an e-mail			1
if you stop your life for fear of what could be , you never experience anything			0
" that 's not good enough for @entity306 , who decided not to take a cruise with her family after learning about the outbreak on the @entity27 ship			0
" we were in the process of looking for a cruise when this story came on , " @entity306 wrote @entity0 , via e-mail			0
" we have decided our money will serve us much better by keeping both feet on terra firma , where we can walk away if something goes sideways			0
" we will not be going on any cruises			0
