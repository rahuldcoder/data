-- after an improbable 10 - year , 310 - million - mile journey to become the first ever space vehicle to make a soft landing on a comet , the @entity2 probe may have ended its mission prematurely			1
its batteries have run down , said the @entity10			1
" @entity2 has fallen into ' idle mode ' for a potentially long silence			2
in this mode , all instruments and most systems on board are shut down , " @entity10 said			2
@entity2 was supposed to transmit data from @entity19 for nine months as it passed the sun , running on solar power , but it did not get its place in the sunlight that scientists had hoped for			1
bounce landing the probe 's landing did n't go as planned this week , after @entity2 detached from the @entity29 orbiter			1
it took two bounces away from its designated landing spot , and never fired its anchoring harpoon			0
" the lander remains unanchored to the surface at an as yet undetermined orientation , " @entity10 said			2
it ended up in a shady spot of @entity40 , @entity10 said , likely without enough sunlight to keep functioning			1
originally , it was supposed to have seven hours of light per comet day -- which lasts just 12.4 hours			2
now it is exposed only 1.5 hours a day			0
that 's likely not enough to juice up @entity2 's rechargeable secondary battery , @entity10 said			1
there is one last hope			0
" mission controllers sent commands to rotate the lander 's main body , to which the solar panels are fixed , " @entity10 says in on its blog			1
" this may have exposed more panel area to sunlight			0
" despite its walleyed positioning , @entity2 transmitted data and black - and - white photos back to @entity64 and @entity10 scientists			1
the pictures appear to indicate it landed in some sort of shadow , possibly the shadow of a cliff			0
opinion : the big lesson from comet landing race to transmit data @entity2 turned on its instruments , drilling for samples , and while there was still time , transferred data			1
now , the lander has fallen silent			0
its operators on @entity64 lost contact with it early saturday			0
built by a @entity85 consortium , led by the @entity86 , the landing probe has 10 instruments			2
" the lander ( was ) racing against the clock to meet as many of the core science goals as possible before the primary battery ( was ) exhausted , " @entity10 said			1
its operators are satisfied with the results , and praised @entity2 for completing its mission slated for the comet 's surface , before it went into hibernation			1
opinion : how comet mission helps in search for alien life the @entity103 space agency , which operates @entity2 for @entity10 , has taken a light - hearted approach to the battery 's impending doom , putting out witty messages on a confirmed @entity109 account in @entity2 's name			1
" i 'm feeling a bit tired , did you get all my data ? i might take a nap , " a post read			0
" so much hard work			0
. getting tired ... my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now , " another read			0
it 's possible that the conditions may change as the comet moves closer to the sun , making it possible to charge the secondary battery			2
then @entity2 could awaken from its deep slumber and send data and photo surprises back to @entity64 , @entity10 said			1
even with the lander out of commission , the @entity29 orbiter that carried the @entity2 lander will continue to transmit observations of the comet			2
elated scientists show off latest pics from historic comet mission ten year voyage @entity29 took off from @entity64 10 years ago , aboard an ariane 5 rocket , and traveled 6.4 billion miles before rendezvousing with the comet in august			0
the @entity2 lander separated from the orbiting @entity29 about 3:30 a.m. et wednesday and first landed on the comet seven hours later			2
the lander weighs about 220 pounds and is the size of a domestic washing machine			0
the target comet is only 4 kilometers , or 2.5 miles , in diameter			0
the spaceship is named after the @entity148 , an inscribed piece of volcanic rock found in @entity151 in 1799 that allowed scientists to decipher hieroglyphics and thus understand the ancient @entity151 culture , @entity10 said			0
the lander is named after an island in the @entity157 where an obelisk was found that helped decipher the @entity148 , @entity10 said			0
led by @entity10 with a consortium of partners including @entity162 , scientists on the @entity29 comet - chasing mission hoped to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind : high energy particles blasted into space by the sun. opinion : @entity2 's comet landing is amazing @entity0 's @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity2 's operators satisfied that the probe completed its mission on the comet
@entity2 's landing did n't go as planned , leaving it in the shade , @entity10 says
it is supposed to run on solar power , but now there 's not enough sunlight for that
@entity2 's primary battery was running out and is *expected* to be dead
