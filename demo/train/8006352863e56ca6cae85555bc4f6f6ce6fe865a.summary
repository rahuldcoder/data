-- since 17 june , @entity2 civilians have been demonstrating against the totalitarian regime that has ruled them for 23 years			1
their protests against rising food and fuel prices have reportedly broadened into criticism of the corrupt @entity9 junta , rebranded as the @entity10			2
predictably , the security forces are responding with swift and brutal force			2
equally predictably , @entity14 's leaders blame foreigners for fomenting the unrest			1

demonstrations last year were swiftly crushed , leaving citizens in no doubt they risked their lives if they challenged the decrepit status quo			0
local journalists have been arrested and intimidated , and foreign reporters are harassed in an effort to stifle media coverage			0
activists warn the internet may be unplugged by the regime at any moment			1
and yet , the demonstrations continue to spread			0
in a country rated as among the ten most repressive and corrupt nations by @entity40 and @entity41 , there is no freedom of speech or assembly			1
the stuttering economy is in the hands of the ruling elite in @entity47 and their cronies , and the regions have felt marginalized for decades			0
losing a third of its territory , and most of its oil to the new @entity14 was the culmination of a disastrous policy of @entity59 ethnic cleansing			1
and the recent removal of price controls on essential consumer goods has tested the endurance of a stoic nation			0
more : @entity2 police crackdown on growing protests @entity14 's president , the indicted war criminal @entity69 , calls protestors " aliens and bubbles , " led by a few " incited " individuals			1
the mayor of @entity47 explains that @entity2 authorities have detected " foreign elements " organizing the marches			1
this is standard practice in @entity14 : the @entity79 and @entity80 are held responsible for stirring up the rebellious ethnic groups in the south , then @entity83 and the east , and now along the contested border with @entity14			1
in other words , the regime is never to be held to account for its calamitous foreign and domestic policies			2
more : @entity14 , @entity14 prepare for peace talks over the years @entity69 's speeches have routinely heaped abuse on the imperialist @entity93 with its dastardly , alien plots			1
in a region where few people know how to access impartial sources of news , and where many people are illiterate , it makes sense to play on their paranoia			0
it also helps rally a fractious nation around a faltering regime , united against an imaginary enemy			2
this approach is familiar to @entity69 's close friends and ideological buddies , the @entity110 , for the same reasons			0
a recent report on @entity14 in a @entity114 paper explains that all separatist groups , from the @entity116 to @entity117 to @entity83 , are part of a conspiracy organized by evil , colonialist powers			1
however , blaming foreigners also says a great deal about how @entity69 and his supporters view their population , revealing their contempt for their citizens ' intelligence			0
their message is , in effect , " you are simple people who are easily manipulated by outsiders , incapable of forming your own opinions			0
" their iron control of all public debate is part of what psychiatrists call the " infantilization " process			1
blaming evil foreigners also shifts attention away from the incompetence and corruption that has marked the @entity69 regime			2
instead of using years of oil revenue to develop the country and diversify the economy , it chose to wage successive wars against its own people in the name of creating a supposedly pure ethnic @entity158 and @entity159 nation			2
until recently @entity158 autocrats resorted to similar tactics to pacify the restive " @entity158 street			0
" when people asked why their economies were so feeble , why their young men could find no work , their rulers responded by telling them about the iniquities suffered by their brothers in @entity170			0
@entity171 has used the same strategy recently , blaming foreign infiltrators for the @entity175 revolution ; @entity176 did the same , and in may 2012 @entity178 authorities banned several foreign ngos including the uber - respectable and impartial @entity180 , accusing them of stirring up trouble			0
this shared narrative is based on embracing the victimhood of the @entity158 people , as if they are powerless to challenge fate			0
yet , this is hardly an exclusively @entity158 syndrome : @entity187 uses the same approach in @entity189 , making the work of foreign human rights @entity192 almost impossible			0

they have ceased to accept that there was no alternative but to submit to the inept and corrupt dictators who have ruled them			2
it has been a bumpy and bloody journey , but it often is when people take control of their destiny			2
saturday , @entity14 's ruling @entity9 celebrates 23 years in power			1
as demonstrations spread from the capital @entity47 to cities across the country , from students and intellectuals to the disgruntled unemployed , the system created by @entity69 and his cronies is wobbling			0
but it is a system 's survival at stake , not just a few individuals			0
the resilient @entity2 will soon see how much change is possible .			1
