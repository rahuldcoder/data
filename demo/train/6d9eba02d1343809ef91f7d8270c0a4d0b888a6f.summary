it breaks my heart to read about the death of @entity4 , a homeless man shot and killed by @entity6 police in march			1
@entity4 was apparently mentally ill. his death recalls the january shooting of @entity9 , the @entity10 teenager who , his family says , suffered from schizophrenia and who was shot and killed after police arrived to help with a crisis			1
many details of that case are still unclear , and it 's hard to know who or what is responsible			2
tragically , incidents such as this appear over and over again in the news			0
the scenario goes something like this : police are called to assist with a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis			1
there is an escalation in tensions , perhaps the introduction of a real or imagined threat , and this leads to someone getting hurt or , worse , killed			0
and it 's not always the person in crisis ; sometimes , it is the police officer			1
another all - too - common outcome is that the person in crisis ends up not at the hospital but at the jail			1
police officers , families and certainly people with mental health conditions do n't want this to happen			1
and it does n't have to			1
there is a time - tested , well - researched way to lessen the likelihood that calling the police for assistance will end badly			1
in 1988 , an approach was developed in @entity56 that has been slowly -- too slowly -- making its way throughout the country			1
it 's called @entity60 , usually just referred to as @entity61 here 's how @entity61 works : a team of police officers ( or other first responders ) from one department or jurisdiction , or from a coalition of neighboring departments , undergoes a comprehensive week - long ( 40 - hour ) training program that does several things			1
it teaches some basics about mental illnesses , substance abuse disorders and developmental disabilities , and it explains how to recognize and interact with someone with these conditions who is in crisis			0
news reports indicate that the detective who was put on administrative leave after the @entity9 shooting had not completed the @entity61 program , though others in the @entity86 , where he served , had			1
if true , we ca n't know whether this would have changed the outcome , but it most certainly could have helped			1
a cadre of community experts provides the training			0
they include fellow police officers , mental health professionals , family members and people who live with mental health conditions			1
in addition to clinical information and learning about community resources ( and how to link to them ) , trainees hear personal stories , acquire de-escalation skills and put knowledge into practice through role play			0
officers and people who have had their own crises act out a number of no - holds - barred , real - life scenarios			0
they also get a sense of what it 's like to experience extreme mental health symptoms , such as hearing voices			0
it 's not always pretty to watch or listen to , but the outcomes of the @entity61 training show great promise			2
research shows that when @entity61 trained officers respond to a call , there are myriad benefits			0
the use of physical restraints goes way down , as do injuries to people in crisis and to officers			2
people are less likely to be arrested and taken to jail			2
and because officers know how to connect people to community services , the need to use the most expensive emergency services can sometimes be avoided			0
equally valuable is the goodwill that @entity61 engenders			0
officers report greater satisfaction in knowing how to help people , and citizens report greater trust in their police			2
if cities as large as @entity151 and @entity152 and rural communities such as @entity154 in @entity155 and @entity156 , @entity157 , can institute @entity61 , why are n't there teams in every community ? of course , it costs money to pull officers off the street , to train police dispatchers , to pay for materials and for costs associated with using community buildings			1
grants from government entities and foundations can at times help to offset these costs			0
and much of the training is done by volunteers			0
while the basics of the training program remain the same , it must be tailored to each locality			2
therefore , more than anything else instituting a @entity61 program takes commitment and coordination			2
this usually begins with a person , or small group of people , building a coalition of community stakeholders			0
how many fewer tragedies might there be if more people stepped forward to become @entity61 champions ? ' my brother just needed help , and now he is dead '			0

@entity194 : @entity4 was homeless man , mentally *disturbed* , shot by cops
program that trains cops to deal with mentally ill might have helped , she says
she says such education *improves* outcomes , reduces injuries , death , jail time
@entity207 : why is n't every police force across the country offering the program ?
