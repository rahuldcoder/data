-- the vast sums of money made by football 's middle men continues to soar , with @entity6 clubs this week detailing huge amounts paid to agents for helping to seal multi-million - dollar deals during the last 12 months			1
big - spending table - toppers @entity11 predictably had the highest outlay , paying agents to the tune of $ 15.2 million between october 1 , 2010 and september 30 , 2011 for aiding the transfer of players such as @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
immediately behind @entity11 were @entity20 ( $ 12 million ) and @entity21 ( $ 11 million )			2
these figures beg the question , what do @entity25 's biggest clubs gain from the use of agents and why are the payments made to them so large ? the total Â £ 71.87 million ( $ 112.8 million ) spent in that period is a rise of almost $ 7.5 million			1
" it 's very hard to know , to be honest -- clubs need to give us some answers , " @entity33 editor @entity32 told @entity0			1
" there 's no reason that they should be that high , because most of those clubs have very good scouting networks			0
" @entity43 and @entity44 primed for @entity46 kick - off @entity32 believes that with clubs now possessing wide - ranging global scouting networks , the need to pay such large sums to agents should be lessened			1
" they discover and scout players themselves , and the clubs that are n't scouting players are relying on agents			2
they do n't need to be doing that			0
they 've got their own scouting network , " he said			0
with agents primarily employed to negotiate deals on behalf of players with their respective clubs , @entity32 argues it is the footballers themselves who should foot the bill for their services			1
" it 's the player that hires the agent to secure them a transfer , a new contract , so the players really should be paying the fees , " he said			2
" it 's a big surprise to me that clubs continue to cover agents ' fees , rather than insist the players , who are so well paid , reward their agents for the work they 've done			1
" while the spending on agents could be considered as an unnecessary expense , @entity32 praised @entity25 's top division for showing the sort of transparency lacking in other top @entity93 leagues			1
" i think it 's a positive that the @entity6 actually publishes the information , " he explained			0
" the @entity6 has to be applauded for publishing the figures			0
" it 's a good thing that they 're published , it 's a bad thing that they 're so high			0
" @entity32 also outlined the danger of having agents who represent managers and players employed by the same club , such as when manager @entity106 and @entity108 striker @entity107 were both at @entity11 while being represented by @entity111 @entity110			1
" i think certain clubs rely on particular agents who are not just representing players , but also representing managers , " he said			2
" managers now have agents			0
the @entity117 appointment , replacing @entity118 , there are a number of managers in the frame for the job who are with agents who also have high - profile players			2
" there 's a clear conflict of interest there and clubs tend to rely on managers who share an agent with players , and i think that is a dangerous situation to get into			1
" @entity32 wants stronger regulations placed upon agents , and hopes that financial fair - play regulations set to be introduced by @entity93 football 's governing body @entity138 will help improve the situation			1
the new rules are aimed at preventing clubs across @entity93 spending beyond their means in pursuit of on - field success			0
" it 's the nature of the modern game at the moment , it 's unregulated and the money is going out of the game into the bank accounts of agents , " @entity32 said			2
" i think over the next few years we are going to see more regulation with @entity138 's financial fair play			0
" what they 're trying to do with financial fair play is have a system in place where clubs regulate their own spending , and clubs are aware that they ca n't just be throwing money at players and wages			0
" i think @entity138 are moving in the right direction , but it 's the clubs who have got take up the initiative			0
there will always be agents around trying to take money out of the game			0
