-- commentators who have watched the conflict in @entity3 play out for decades call the peace process a miracle			1
various leaders negotiated for years to bring an end to @entity3 's " troubles			1
" culminating in a power sharing deal between @entity14 's unionists , led by @entity15 , and @entity16 , the political arm of the @entity19 ( nationalists ) , led by @entity20 , the road to peace has been a torturous one characterized by violence , set - backs and numerous false starts			1
only recently the @entity24 , @entity3 's largest loyalist group , said it will cease to be an armed paramilitary group , starting at midnight on november 11 , saying the " war is over			1
" " all weaponry will be put beyond use , " @entity27 of the @entity28 , which is linked to the group , said in a speech in @entity31 aired by @entity32 , @entity34 's state - owned broadcaster			2
" the struggle to maintain the union is on a new and more complex battlefield			0
" the @entity40 ( @entity19 ) disarmed two years ago , helping to restore the province 's government in @entity31			2
@entity44 prime minister @entity43 said the most recent moves of groups to disarm was " significant and hopefully signals a further step toward the ending of all paramilitarism in @entity3			1
" for those that have lived through the turmoil in @entity3 , peace achieved though diplomacy must have seemed like an unrealistic goal			1
after all , each attack by loyalists usually resulted in retaliation by nationalists -- making the dispute bitter and intractable			0
but diplomacy has worked in bringing peace to @entity3			1
credit for developing a framework for the peace process stretches back to former @entity68 prime minster @entity67 's rule in the 1990s and efforts by @entity3 's @entity43			1
but it was @entity67 's successor , @entity71 , who was unrelenting in his quest for peace by making it a major priority of his government			1
@entity71 came to @entity3 37 times as prime minister , traveling there more often than any of his predecessors as well as hosting many meetings at 10 @entity81 and discussing the peace process while at many international summits			1
according to the @entity87 : " when he ( @entity71 ) said on that first day he had come to seek ' a lasting and fair political settlement ' it turned out he was n't spouting platitudes on a stump			0
" journalist @entity88 , who covered the peace process talks , says : " @entity71 played a clever hand			1
he saw the hardliners had to be involved			0
" critically he judged that the process had to tilt ever so slightly towards the republicans to prevent a split in their ranks and the resumption of violence by radicals -- which had happened whenever the republican leadership had inclined to moderation before			2
" @entity88 says @entity81 had a bicycle theory around peace talks : " they had to keep going forward otherwise they would fall over			2
" it was @entity71 's diplomacy that wooed the previously immovable @entity15			1
@entity44 political scientist @entity107 told the @entity108 the alliance with @entity15 was @entity71 's " last great romance ... once again when we thought the old maestro was fading , his capacity to seduce , politically speaking , is phenomenal			2
" but as @entity20 of @entity16 told @entity0 , the conflict was primarily a local one that needed to be solved by local people : " the people who have to be the brokers are the people who live in the areas of conflict			1
" they 're the people who ought to be the brokers but everybody else from the outside has to enhance the conditions so that those leaders or factions can actually broker not just an agreement , but implement an agreement			0
" the @entity131 -- and [ former @entity133 ] senator [ @entity132 ] @entity130 said this at the time , when we got the agreement -- " that 's the easy bit			2
implementing it is going to be the difficult bit			0
" @entity130 worked with the various participants to reach an agreement			0
the long road to peace the " troubles " have been a centuries - old dispute between @entity143 and @entity3 over who controls @entity3			1
in 1609 @entity68 colonial settlers confiscated native - owned land in @entity3 and settled in @entity14 with mainly @entity149 @entity68 planters			1
there was conflict between the planters and the native @entity44			0
the planters won the bloody ethno - religious conflicts that followed and cracked down on the political and religious freedoms of the indigenous @entity44			0
in the 1700s groups formed ( including the @entity158 that continue to this day ) and antagonisms between the two communities became entrenched			0
@entity34 was incorporated into the @entity68 in 1801 and reformers such as @entity162 called for the repeal of the union as well as the end of discrimination of @entity167 ( around 75 percent of the population )			2
the agitation of the @entity170 , who sometimes held the balance of power in @entity173 , led to the unionists further entrenching their position for @entity68 rule			1
in 1920 guerilla warfare between what became known as the @entity19 and @entity179 led to the partitioning of southern @entity3 and @entity3			1
nationalists in @entity3 , who numbered around 35 per cent of the population , did not accept legitimacy of the new partition			1
between 1970 and 1972 tensions that had been brewing erupted into violence with almost 500 people killed in @entity3			1
one explanation for this was the formation of the real @entity19 , which embraced " armed struggle " against @entity68 rule			0
another was the introduction of internment without trial ( the vast majority of those imprisoned were @entity200 ) which succeed in politicizing many into the nationalist cause			0
@entity203 -- a january 1972 shooting in @entity204 of 14 unarmed nationalist civil rights activists by the @entity206 -- was a flashpoint in the conflict			0
in 1972 the retaliation of the @entity40 came at a massive cost -- more than 100 soldiers were killed , 500 were wounded and there were 1300 bombings			0
yet the nationalists vowed to continue their campaign until there was a united @entity3			2
successive @entity68 governments failed to solve the " @entity44 question " so the participants settled in for what the @entity19 called the @entity40 , which involved sustained , low - level violence , hunger strikes and protests			2
the stop - start cease - fire since the late 1980s @entity16 , which compared its struggle to that of the fight for liberation in @entity229 and @entity230 , has sought a negotiated end to the conflict			2
both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared a cease - fire after much negotiation			0
but the peace was fragile and short - lived			2
the @entity19 , led by @entity20 , revoked the cease - fire in 1996 after a bombing at @entity239 in @entity240 that killed two and caused Â£ 85 million worth of damage			0
in june 1996 a large part of @entity244 's city center was destroyed by an @entity19 bomb that injured 200 people			0
splinter groups of the @entity19 who rejected the notion of a cease - fire continued their campaigns			0
in august 1998 the @entity19 bombed @entity252 , killing 29 civilians			0
but during the 1990s many world leaders still held out for peace in @entity3			1
supporters of talks included the president of the @entity133 , @entity258 , who in 1995 visited @entity3 and spoke in @entity31 of the " peace process , " calling terrorists " yesterday 's men			1
" diplomacy in action in 1997 newly elected @entity68 prime minister @entity71 endorsed a report on decommissioning and the criteria for inclusion in all - party talks			0
@entity269 , the @entity68 's secretary of state for northern ireland , accepted in august 1997 that the @entity19 cease - fire was genuine and invited @entity16 for multi-party talks			1
on good friday , april 10 1998 , it was announced that the two governments and political parties in @entity3 had reached an agreement to share power			1
it later emerged that president @entity258 had made a number of calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach an agreement			0
the agreement included a devolved , inclusive government , prisoner release , troop reduction , paramilitary decommissioning , and the addressing of the question of @entity44 reunification			0
the definitive end of the peace process -- and the @entity291 - came in 2007 following the @entity293 agreement in october 2006 and the march 2007 elections			1
the @entity295 and @entity16 formed a government in may 2007 and in july 2007 the @entity206 formally ended their mission in @entity3 , 38 years after their deployment			1
today , @entity3 is still part of the @entity68 but the @entity68 government has said if there is a majority of votes then a united @entity3 will be possible			2
the key to winning support from the @entity307 / @entity304 was the @entity308 recognizing the " @entity309 " -- that the @entity44 as a whole should have the right to work out the issues between the @entity313 and the @entity230 , without outside interference			0
prosperity and peace according to an article in the @entity319 , former sectarians have been tamed not only by peace but also by prosperity			2
" the little brick houses which rose 56 percent in price in the last year cost more than the @entity143 average			0
the locals fly from @entity329 to their @entity331 second homes			0
these people are , in the local phase , ' recovering sectarians , ' " according to the @entity319 aiding this process is the @entity336 , which is flooding @entity3 with funds , believing that the peace and diplomatic process needs to be financially assisted			1
the @entity336 's investment , worth 724 million euros ( about 1.03 billion @entity133 dollars ) will be made available through the three programs -- the @entity343 program , the cross-border cooperation program with @entity34 and @entity345 , and the @entity347 and @entity348 program for the province			0
but peace and prosperity would not have occurred without the success of diplomacy , says @entity20			1
" there 's been a war somewhere in the world for every day of every week of every month of the last few decades and all of them are caused by human beings , mostly by men ... all of them can be resolved through dialogue			0

some commentators have called the peace process in @entity3 a " miracle "
it culminated in a power sharing deal between the @entity14 's unionists and @entity16
peace and prosperity would not have occurred without diplomacy
