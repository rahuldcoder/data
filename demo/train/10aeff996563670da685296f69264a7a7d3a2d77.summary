from fighting terrorism to processing payments in the blink of an eye , facial recognition is set to change our ideas on privacy			1
a number of exciting developments in the field could even push its toughest critics to reconsider			1
" the more people get out of it , the more they 'll surrender to it , " says @entity12 , senior vice president of digital for @entity13 believes that people will only embrace a technology if the benefits outweigh privacy concerns			2
facial recognition is a computer - based system that automatically identifies a person based on a digital image or video source -- which is then matched to information stored in a database			1
often used in fictional tv - series such as @entity29 : @entity29 , it is soon set to become a real - life tool for fighting crime			1
in 2014 , the @entity33 will roll the technology out across the @entity35 after pilot testing is completed in some states			1
facial recognition is a key part of the agency 's ambitious $ 1 billion @entity40 ( @entity42 ) -- a state - of - the - art biometric identification system that also includes iris scans , dna analysis and voice identification			1
the mission is to reduce terrorist and criminal activity by improving and expanding biometric identification as well as criminal history information services			2
@entity53 - based dr. @entity52 is an advocate for the technology too			2
a professor at the @entity56 , @entity52 has created an " electronic sketch artist " system that has changed how @entity53 police identify criminals			0
his method is currently used by 90 % of @entity53 police and in more than 30 countries			0
he explains : " the key advantage here is that it allows people to respond to faces they see rather than having to break it down into component parts			0
" credited with helping to solve hundreds of crimes , his facial composite software identifies suspected criminals in a new way			2
the system , @entity75 , allows victims and witnesses to select the best and worst matches from a group of computer - generated faces			0
based on their responses , the computer eventually " learns " what type of face they are after and displays options accordingly			2
but facial recognition technology is n't always so straightforward			1
identifying faces from closed - circuit - television ( @entity92 ) footage can be challenging -- as demonstrated after the @entity94 bombings earlier this year			0
@entity95 , director of the @entity96 , told @entity98 's @entity97 that low resolution can be especially challenging			0
" when you look at images collected from standard @entity92 footage , the faces are way too small , " he said in may			0
@entity95 explained that it is especially difficult matching off - angle images to frontal facial photographs			2
the solution @entity107 's team has created is a system that transforms flat photos into @entity110			0
he argues the ability to recreate a suspect from all angles will improve the reliability of facial recognition and also help police track down suspects faster			1
the luxury retail sector appears to see potential in facial recognition too			1
according to the @entity124 , dozens of stores and hotels are testing the technology in the @entity35 , the @entity53 , and the @entity126			1
@entity53 - based company @entity127 , which also specializes in identification of terrorists and criminals , has created a system that analyzes the faces of potential customers as they enter shops			0
the system then checks this information against a database with celebrities and valued customers -- to help stores identify potential big spenders			2
once a match is made , the software alerts staff via computer , tablet or smartphone			0
it can even provide details such as clothing size and shopping history			0
@entity12 believes that consumers are likely to volunteer information about themselves online if it enhances their shopping experience and helps provide recommendations that " make sense			2
" a @entity158 company , meanwhile , aims to streamline sales by using facial recognition technology for payments			1
@entity163 - based @entity162 has patented a system allowing payments to be made without wallets or smartphones			0
" i 've always been fascinated with how people purchase things and started thinking about the ideal way to pay as you walk into a store , " says @entity167 , the inventor of the idea			2
anticipating potential customer concerns , @entity167 says that he is n't too concerned the technology could be marred by security risks			1
" we 've been thinking about this from day one			0
facial recognition is secure by nature and is fundamentally a biometric technology since you need to be in the store to use the technology			1
" but not everyone has embraced facial recognition with open arms			1
in 2011 , @entity188 introduced a controversial feature which automatically identifies faces in uploaded photos by comparing them to other tagged pictures			0
it was rolled out without warning -- a move that backfired in the @entity197 as regulators and privacy campaigners forced the social networking site to turn off the functionality			0
in spite of this , @entity188 recently announced plans to extend facial recognition to profile photos in other parts of the world			1
" our goal is to facilitate tagging so that people know when there are photos of them on our service , " @entity188 chief privacy officer @entity209 told @entity210			0
@entity217 , the director of the domestic surveillance project at the @entity219 in @entity220 argues that @entity188 has the largest biometric database in the world , which could eventually compromise its users			0
in an interview with @entity226 , @entity224 said : " no matter how much a company attempts to protect your privacy , if they 're collecting information about you , that information is vulnerable to government search			1

soon , you could pay for goods simply by showing your face to a scanner
government agencies are keen to use the technology , with the stated aim of fighting crime
the @entity33 will roll out advanced facial recognition technology across the @entity35 in 2014
critics warn of the " compromising " risks of giving *intimate* information away
