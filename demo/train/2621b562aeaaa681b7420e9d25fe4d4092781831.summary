-- the eyes of the world are upon @entity3 , the ailing former @entity4 president and vanguard of human rights who was reported in critical condition sunday evening			1

she said her father was at peace , and the family hoped for a peaceful transition into the spiritual realm			1

... he is at peace with himself			2
he has given so much to the world			2
i believe he is at peace			2
" @entity3 reported in critical condition some of that peace eludes the family , however , as they deal with the intense media spotlight			1
" with all of this media frenzy , the camping in the hospital , you know people talking about things they do n't know or understand basically			1
other people want to lecture us on how we should behave , what we should do			0
" really ? it 's our dad			0
it 's the children 's grandfather			0
we 've never had him in our life for better part of our years			0
this is in a sense quality and sacred time for us , and i would expect the world to really back off and leave us alone " @entity3 's blood runs through these veins			1
give us the space to be with our father			2
whether these are the last moments with us to be with our dad or there is still a longer			0

he still opens his eyes ... the touch is there			0
" she also addressed how much medical treatment her father should receive			2
" in our culture , the @entity76 culture , ... you never release the person unless the person has told you : ' please my children , my family , release me			0
' my dad has n't said that to us			0
" so these people who want to talk about , you know , release him , he has n't said we should release him and we have n't come to the end yet			2
it is only @entity88 who knows the end			1
" unusual tributes to @entity3			0
