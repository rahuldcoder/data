-- while president @entity2 has made promoting rights for gays and lesbians worldwide a key foreign policy goal , that is little comfort to @entity8 , a former @entity9 diplomat who is gay			1
@entity8 is fighting a years - long battle for asylum in the @entity12 , convinced his life will be in danger if he is forced to return home			1
the case presents a dilemma for the @entity2 administration as the president travels to @entity9 to meet with @entity20 amid a time of strained relations between the close allies			1
@entity9 's radical form of @entity25 mandates the death penalty for same - sex relations			1
" i come from the darkest place on earth , " @entity8 said in a phone interview from his home in @entity30			1
" we are brainwashed that we have the best system and sharia law comes from god			2
but they teach us to hate others			2
i came to @entity12 to clear my mind			1
" @entity8 grew up in a middle class conservative @entity9 family , the middle child with three brothers and three sisters			1
his parents had little education and raised him and his brothers and sisters true to @entity9 culture and religion			1
there was no music or tv			2
he did n't know for years that he was gay			2
by age 13 , he realized he was different than other boys his age , he just had no idea what that difference was			2
" we do n't have any education about sex			1
you do n't know what gay means			2
you just know that you have feelings			2
you ca n't talk about it with anyone			2
according to the @entity70 they are a sin			2
i thought it would just go away			0
i just had feelings but you ca n't talk about it with any person			0
" as a law student , he considered a career as an attorney and took a job as a clerk for a judge in the @entity9 court			1
after a few months , he quit			0
in a petition seeking asylum to the @entity12 obtained by @entity0 , he wrote that " unfair bias " in the treatment of cases in @entity9 made it " morally impossible for me to continue			1
" " i was frequently upset and saddened by the system in general and the punishments given to the accused , " he wrote			0
@entity94 sexuality for another year he worked as a trainee in the @entity96 , where he would check on the prisoners to see whether they were receiving proper treatment			0
he was forced by his managers to witness prisoners being lashed , which gave him bad dreams			0
he quit his job once again , frustrated with the harsh punishments and his inability to do anything to stop them			0
at that time he started to investigate his faith , religion and sexuality			0
" without these jobs i would n't be the same person now , " he said			0
" i began to understand something is n't right about the way we practice religion			0
something did n't feel good			0
i said to myself the only way you can have freedom is to be a diplomat and travel out of the country			1
" he joined the @entity127 as a diplomat and got married to a @entity9 woman , all the time hiding his feelings and dreaming of the day he could leave the country and live his life as an openly gay man			1
when his wife gave birth to his son , @entity132 , @entity8 tried one last time to give his arrangement a chance			0
but he found he could not keep up the charade and they divorced in 2004			0
@entity8 was transferred to the @entity9 consulate in @entity138 the next year			1
a double life here , he writes in his asylum petition , " i discovered the gay community , the gay culture and that i was in fact gay			1
" for four years he led a double life			0
by day , he was a traditional diplomat			1
by night , he visited gay bars and told friends he was from @entity147 or any other country than his own			0
@entity8 's two worlds collided in 2009 when he fell in love and moved into a @entity30 apartment with his boyfriend			0
finding happiness for the first time , he enjoyed an open social life in @entity30 with his new friends			0
soon his colleagues began to ask him about his life outside of work and started following him			0
when his passport expired and he submitted it for renewal , he received no reply			0
after several months , his office told him his time in the @entity12 was up and he would have to return to @entity9			1
he began to fear he was found out			0
he called a friend in the foreign ministry in @entity168 , who told him indeed the consul general sent a letter to the ministry stating he was gay and had information about his lifestyle			0
" this is when i became really scared and paranoid , " he writes in his asylum petition			1
" i was so scared they would do something to me physically			0
i was even afraid to go to my car thinking there could be a bomb in it			0
when i came home i had to check every closet			1
" he sent a letter to various news organizations saying he was being harassed by colleagues and he feared for his life			0
fearing persecution he applied for asylum as a gay person who would face persecution if sent home			1
in more than eight hours of questioning , immigration officers focused on his jobs in the @entity9 courts and @entity196			1
his bid for asylum was no common occurrence			2
the last @entity9 diplomat to seek asylum was in 1994 , when @entity202 , then first secretary for the @entity9 mission to the @entity204 , was granted asylum for publicly criticizing his country 's human rights record and alleged support for terrorism			1
fourteen months later in october 2011 , the @entity210 denied @entity8 's application			0
in the rejection letter , obtained by @entity0 , the government says " evidence indicates that you ordered , incited , assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others on account of race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social group or political opinion			0
" the case went to automatic appeal			2
" they interviewed him once and it took 14 months and it showed they were going for denial , " says @entity227 , a @entity9 dissident and activist that has been helping @entity8 with his case			1
" they used the reason that he worked for the courts to call him a human rights violator which is really bogus			0
" @entity2 on gay rights two months later , @entity2 signed a memorandum on @entity243 to advance the @entity244			1
it included a program to protect gay refugees and asylum seekers , including " ensuring the federal government has the ability to identify and expedite resettlement of highly vulnerable persons with urgent protection needs			2
" in the memo , @entity2 writes that the fight to end discrimination against @entity258 people is " a global challenge " and " central to the @entity12 ' commitment to promoting human rights			1
" " i am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting @entity258 persons around the world â € ” whether it is passing laws that criminalize @entity258 status , beating citizens simply for joining peaceful lgbt pride celebrations , or killing men , women , and children for their perceived sexual orientation , " @entity2 said			1
in its most recent human rights report , the @entity273 said under sharia law in the @entity9 , " consensual same - sex conduct is punishable by death or flogging			1
" ongoing case it was n't until this past february that @entity8 was finally granted a hearing date for his appeal			2
at the court , the immigration officer offered him a deal to remain in the country permanently without possibility of asylum or a green card			2
additionally , he could never leave the country			0
when he rejected the offer , the immigration officer applied for another continuance , saying she needed to submit more documents in the two - year case			1
he is now looking at a new hearing date in 2015			0
today , @entity8 barely makes ends meet as a part - time security guard			2
he lives on couches at friends ' apartments in @entity30			0
his family has shunned him and his ex-wife wo n't allow him to talk to his son			0
as unbearable as his life in limbo is , he says returning to @entity9 would be a death sentence			1
" there is no question , " he says			0
" if you go back and say i am gay and proud and i do n't believe in religion anymore			0
under sharia law this is death			2
you will be happy if they kill you right away			0
" @entity227 , the @entity9 activist , says @entity8 is a victim of @entity12 desires not to upset the @entity9 monarchy			1
@entity8 had been convinced that @entity2 's stated commitment to gay rights would trump politics and keep him safe in the @entity12			1
" when president @entity2 ran in 2008 i supported him			1
i cried for him , i encouraged my @entity12 friends to vote for him			1
now i ca n't stand to watch him on tv , " he says			0
he said he supports the rights of gay people , so why is this happening to me ? " the @entity9 embassy in @entity326 and consulate in @entity138 did not return phone calls			1
the @entity210 declined comment , saying asylum cases were confidential .			2
