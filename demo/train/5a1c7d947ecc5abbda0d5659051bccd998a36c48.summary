@entity0 , @entity1 -- attackers killed at least 11 people wednesday in a region of @entity1 that has been convulsed by violence between @entity8 and @entity9 , an official said			1
@entity8 herdsmen , some dressed in military uniforms , attacked a predominantly @entity13 village at about 1 a.m. wednesday near the city of @entity15 , close to where a machete - wielding @entity8 group killed hundreds in a mostly @entity13 town this month , said @entity19 , special adviser on religious affairs to the governor of the @entity1 state of @entity23			1
opinion : we will fight for the soul of @entity1 the dead included women and children , he said			0
the attackers , from the @entity33 ethnic group , also injured at least four people and stole 120 cattle from the village of @entity37 , he said			2
the violence has put much of oil - rich @entity1 , @entity41 's most populous nation , on edge , with rumors swirling of more attacks			2
authorities in @entity0 took the unusual step of sending a text message to residents to try to put them at ease			0
" please be informed that the story of @entity52 trooping into @entity0 for the past three days to cause chaos is baseless , " the message said			0
" all security agencies have investigated this rumor individually and collectively and found that there 's no iota of truth in it			0
be advised to go about your lawful business without fear			0

" the attacks wednesday followed the massacre earlier this month of roughly 200 people near @entity15 , a city in central @entity1 that lies on a faith - based fault - line between @entity8 - dominated northern @entity1 and the mainly @entity13 south			1
a few weeks ago , @entity8 attackers with guns , machetes , and knives killed people in several @entity13 villages near @entity15 in apparent retaliation for previous attacks against @entity86 communities and the theft of cattle from herdsmen , @entity76 said			1
what 's behind slaughter in @entity1 ? thousands of people in @entity23 have been killed in similar outbreaks of violence in the last decade , said @entity95 , a senior @entity41 researcher at @entity76			1
though the violence often pits @entity9 and @entity8 against each other , it has more to do with disputes over access to natural resources than religion , according to @entity103 , the archbishop of @entity104 , @entity1			1
former @entity1 president @entity105 also has said that the violence is fueled more by ethnic , social , and economic problems than religion			1
" if you have one group or a community that has land that 's been encroached upon by another community or even by itinerant cattle farmers , then the people who lay claim to the land will fight back , " he recently told @entity2 's @entity109			2
" if there are job opportunities in an area , and persons believe they are indigenous to that area , and ( are ) not getting enough out of the jobs that are available , they will fight those who are getting the jobs			0
