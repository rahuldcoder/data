-- @entity1 , the @entity2 serving time in a @entity4 , @entity5 , prison on a conviction of drug smuggling , has had her jail term cut by five years			0
@entity5 president @entity10 's decree to reduce the former beauty therapist 's 20 - year jail sentence to 15 years arrived in a letter on monday , according to @entity14 , a spokesman of @entity15			1
the decree was dated may 15 and also stipulated that the original 100 million @entity5 rupiah ( us $ 10,700 ) fine still had to be paid , the spokesman added			1
before entering @entity22 prison to visit her on wednesday , @entity19 's sister , @entity20 , expressed gratitude for the decision			2
" our family would like to say , ' thank you , ' to the @entity5 president , " she said			0
" we now hope to get more information about possible parole for @entity1 , and we hope to get positive news on that			0
' the appeal for clemency , which @entity19 filed on the basis of a medical examination that diagnosed her as suffering from acute depression with psychotic symptoms , comes nearly seven years to the day of her sentencing			1
@entity19 , now 34 , was convicted in may 2005 for smuggling nine pounds ( 4.1 kilograms ) of marijuana in a bag while arriving at @entity4 's @entity44 the previous october			2
she has always maintained her innocence , saying that she was the victim of a drug smuggling operation			0
aside from whether @entity19 will be eligible for parole -- and if so , where she would serve it -- the timeframe for her release remains unclear because of remissions granted for good behavior			2
a spokesperson for @entity58 's @entity57 said , " should ms. @entity1 's legal team apply for parole , the @entity60 would support it			1
" @entity5 's justice and human rights minister @entity63 on wednesday linked @entity19 's case to that of " hundreds of " @entity5 inmates in @entity58 held in trafficking cases and said he hoped they would get similar attention			1
" especially the underage children , whose number are quite many , " he said			0
in addition to those cases , @entity63 cited @entity19 's illness during imprisonment and lighter sentences imposed by other nations on marijuana possession convictions as factors that the government weighed in granting @entity19 clemency			1
meanwhile , @entity2 foreign minister @entity82 said there is no link between the @entity19 case and the release of convicted @entity5 human traffickers , including three from a @entity2 prison last friday amid concerns they were minors			1
" if there were no @entity1 in a @entity4 prison we 'd still be releasing minors , kids on fishing boats who 'd been collected through people smuggling , " he said to reporters wednesday in a video broadcast by @entity58 's @entity93			2
" we 'd be releasing them because it is plainly indecent to have in @entity2 adult jails kids from @entity5 who have been picked up on fishing boats being misused for people smuggling			0
" at no stage has the government sat down with our @entity5 counterparts and said , ' we 'll release minors from our jails , if you consider a clemency application by ms. @entity1			0
' " journalist @entity113 contributed to this report .			0
