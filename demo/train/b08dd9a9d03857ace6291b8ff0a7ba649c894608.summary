-- could you fit your life into 300 square feet ? developers are betting on it , positioning tiny living spaces as a new status symbol for urban millennials			1
chic , central and closet - sized , micro-condos -- loosely defined as units under 500 square feet -- are being marketed as luxury rentals or a stylish first step onto the property ladder			1
while small units are already the norm in high - density @entity21 megacities and old @entity24 neighborhoods , major @entity15 cities like @entity16 and @entity17 are leading a new charge in @entity26 with others quickly following suit			1
" what these great world cities have in common is a scarcity of the resource called land and a large number of people who want to work and play in these cities , " says @entity29 , co-founder of @entity32 developer @entity30			1
according to a report from @entity43 , an @entity15 consumer research company , 40 % of @entity15 between the ages of 18 and 36 want to live in urban areas instead of the suburbs their parents idealized , but 69 % feel they do n't earn enough to afford the lifestyle they covet			1
high rent , rising property prices , and growing demand make finding an affordable home harder than ever			1
local governments have taken notice			2
@entity16 , for one , has waved its minimum 400 - square - foot housing requirement for a pilot project with units between 250 and 370 square feet			1
last year , @entity30 -- which makes 400 - square - foot units for those who earn less than around $ 100,000 a year -- received roughly $ 36 million from the mayor of @entity32 to build approximately 400 units for first - time home buyers			1
small units are seen as an affordable way to make cities accessible to more people			1
this was the case for @entity70 , a hair stylist living in @entity71			0
in 2012 , unable to afford a centrally located apartment , she decided to move into a unit in @entity75 , the city 's first micro-condo			2
most of the studios she 'd seen rented for around $ 1,400 a month , so her 291 - square - feet apartment -- the building 's largest -- seemed like a steal at $ 1,000			1
but it was the design , she says , that she sealed the deal			2
the tiny space -- all enamel - like white cupboards , foldout tables , and wall - mounted design hacks -- was not only smart , but stylish			1
" i wanted something that looked pretty modern			0
the use of space was really good , " she says			0
" i did n't feel like i was living in a jail cell or anything			2
her place was officially cool			0
@entity99 , the @entity16 - based founder of home design website @entity100 , is n't surprised that micro-condo developers are pushing design and utility as their major selling points			1
to him , it shows an awareness of how generational priorities have shifted			0
" as a culture , there 's been a renaissance of interest in design -- design as a lifestyle choice , design as a way of life , " he says			1
@entity99 believes young people will happily accept smaller spaces , but only if done properly			2
" when you design a small space , you can design it in a way that has more utility and expansiveness , " he says , going on to quote @entity123 , one of the 20th century 's most celebrated product designers : " i have never been forced to accept compromises , but i have willingly accepted constraints			2
" it 's a maxim @entity129 , an upcoming micro-condo project in @entity131 , exemplifies			0
the designs , masterminded by architecture firm @entity133 , are stylish , with seemingly endless concealed storage , contemporary finishes , and floor - to - ceiling windows			1
drawers become dishwashers and refrigerators			0
couches fold into beds and walls			0
a number of elements , like a bathtub and oven , have been left out			0
but even these omissions are meant to cater to the millennial lifestyle			0
" this generation wants to live within the city , " says @entity149 , of @entity133			0
when they are n't working , they 're eating out with friends and enjoying city life , not spending time at home			2
for a unit that offers elegance on a budget ( @entity129 units , which have yet to go on sale , will likely start at $ 285,000 ) , @entity149 thinks they 'll be willing to make a few sacrifices			2
" five years ago , if you suggested units of 258 square feet , people would say that 's mean , that 's immoral			1
but that 's starting to flip the other way , " @entity149 says			0
" it 's become a moral cause			0
we need all ( income ) groups to make a healthy city			0
" no one seems to know whether tenants or owners will look at micro-condos as temporary stops , or something more permanent			2
certain elements seem so tailored to a certain lifestyle they risk being outgrown by those they so carefully target			0
for @entity70 , the initial novelty of micro-living wore off as time wore on			0
she started to resent not having space for her screen - printing and acrylics projects , or an oven for cooking			2
when it came time to renew her yearlong lease , she decided to move to a 620 - square - foot unit across the street , even though it cost almost $ 400 more per month			1
today , @entity70 lives with her boyfriend in a 900 - square - foot apartment in @entity71			1
now 35 , she 's more focused on settling down			0
but she does n't regret giving micro-condos a try			1
" my lifestyle has changed a lot since i lived down there , " she says			0
" i liked being there at the time , but i like the space i have now			0

micro-condos -- units under 500 square feet -- are a growing trend in cities like @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity32
developers are targeting millenials who would n't otherwise be able to afford properties in major @entity224 cities
the units are designed to be hyper - functional and stylish to appeal to design - *conscious* young buyers
