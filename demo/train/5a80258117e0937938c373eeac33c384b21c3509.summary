the number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30 % in the past two years , according to a @entity4 report released tuesday			1
the @entity4 estimated that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of " unwanted sexual contact , " a huge jump from the 19,300 figure in the 2010 report			1
" sexual assault is a despicable crime and one of the most serious challenges facing this department , " defense secretary @entity11 told reporters at a briefing on the survey			1
" it 's a threat to the safety and the welfare of our people and to the health , reputation and trust of this institution			2
" the actual number of sexual crimes reported in the fiscal year 2012 was 3,374 , a 6 % increase over the previous year , the report said			1
military officials worry that many victims do n't come forward because they are frightened of retaliation			1
but the numbers might indicate that more victims are willing to report crimes than in the past			2
after officer charged in sex assault , military faces questions @entity44 said victims need to be made confident they can rely on the military 's justice system and that commanders will be held responsible			1
on tuesday , lawmakers reiterated that it 's crucial that service members feel they can come forward when they 've been violated			2
the @entity4 has stepped up efforts to hold perpetrators accountable , establishing a special victims unit to handle cases , working to improve tracking of reports and speeding transfers for troops who report a sexual assault by a member of their unit			1
but president @entity63 stressed that there must be a harder push in the military to reduce sexual assaults involving service members			2
" i do n't want just more speeches or awareness programs or training but ... if we find out somebody is engaging in this stuff , they are going to be held accountable , " @entity63 said			2
" prosecuted , stripped of their positions , court - martialed , fired , dishonorably discharged			2
" maj. gen. @entity79 , the head of the @entity80 for the military , said that while the prevalence rate was " unacceptably high , " the report did indicate one positive trend			2
the percentage of people who initially filed restricted reports ( that remain confidential ) but changed to unrestricted had risen			2
after sex assault case , @entity44 seeks changes to military legal process " we see that as a sign of victim confidence , willingness to ... take their case into the law enforcement realm , " he said			1
the @entity4 data from 2010 to 2012 found that the prevalence of unwanted sexual contact increased for active duty women and remained unchanged for active duty men , and men and women in the reserves			2
meanwhile on tuesday , top @entity110 officials faced questions at a @entity113 hearing about an air force officer accused of sexual assault			1
lt. col. @entity116 , 41 , served as a branch chief for the service 's @entity80 and @entity119 program			0
he was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend and had been removed from current duty , an @entity110 official said monday			1
the official declined to be named because it is an ongoing law enforcement matter			0
@entity126 sen. @entity125 of @entity127 asked air force chief of staff gen. @entity129 and @entity110 secretary @entity130 what qualified @entity116 for the job in the sex assault prevention program			1
@entity116 is a personnel officer by training and has spent the last two - and - a - half years working on @entity110 staff in policy , @entity129 replied			1
" he was a force support squadron commander before coming to the @entity4			0
" force support squadron addresses issues such as sexual assault coordination councils in active @entity110 units , @entity129 said			1
" he 's been around the business his entire career as a personnel officer			0
" @entity126 sen. @entity145 of @entity146 had strong words			0
" if the man in charge for the @entity110 in preventing sexual assault is being alleged to have committed a sexual assault this weekend obviously there 's a failing in training and understanding of what sexual assault is and how corrosive and damaging it is to good order and discipline and how it is undermining the credibility of the greatest military force in the world , " she said			1
" this is not good enough			0
" @entity125 pressed @entity130 and @entity164			0
" did you look at his file for any kind of problems related -- i mean , clearly , the accusation is that he was drunk and sexually attacked a complete stranger in a parking lot , " @entity125 said			0
" it is hard for me to believe that someone would be accused of that behavior by a complete stranger and not have anything in their file that would indicate a problem in that regard			0
" have you looked at his file and determined that his file was absolutely pristine ? " the senator asked			0
military rape victims : stop blaming us " senator , i looked at his officer record of performance which is all i could access last night			0
i talked to his current supervisor , " @entity129 said			0
" i have n't talked to people who knew him or supervised him in the past			0
there is no indication in his professional record of performance or his current work place that there 's any type of a problem like this			0
" earlier tuesday , @entity164 said sexual assault response efforts are critically important to the @entity110 and the branch " would not quit working this problem			1
" in march , members of the military who were sexually assaulted gave dramatic and anguished testimony to congressional lawmakers			0
a former @entity215 specialist described being raped in two different instances while she was in the service and how she felt that the military 's chain of command was failing at consistently prosecuting and convicting offenders			0
at that hearing , high - ranking members of each branch assured lawmakers that they were working hard to end sexual assault in the armed forces			1
lt. gen. @entity228 , an @entity110 judge advocate general , told lawmakers that the branch started a program in january that provides airmen who report being victimized with an attorney to represent them			1
the attorneys operate independently of the prosecution 's chain of command , he said			0
read the entire testimony from march			0
