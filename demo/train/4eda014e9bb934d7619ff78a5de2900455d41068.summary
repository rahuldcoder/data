@entity0 -- the international group @entity2 is accusing @entity3 of firing weapons containing white phosphorus into @entity6			1
the group demands that the alleged practice cease			0
@entity3 is declining to say whether bursts like this over @entity6 involve white phosphorus			1
the group 's researchers in @entity3 " observed multiple air - bursts of artillery - fired white phosphorus over what appeared to be the @entity19 / @entity18 area " on friday and saturday , the organization said on its web site			1
" @entity3 appeared to be using white phosphorus as an ' obscurant ' [ a chemical used to hide military operations ] , a permissible use in principle " under the laws of war , the @entity2 posting said			1
" however , white phosphorus has a significant , incidental , incendiary effect that can severely burn people and set structures , fields , and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire , " the posting said			1
" the potential for harm to civilians is magnified by @entity6 's high population density , among the highest in the world			2
" @entity2 said the use of white phosphorus in @entity6 would violate " the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life			1
" last week , an @entity53 spokesman told @entity1 : " i can tell you with certainty that white phosphorus is absolutely not being used			1
" now , however , @entity3 officials have a different response to questions about the possible use of phosphorus : " any munitions that @entity3 is using are in accordance with international law			1
@entity3 does not specify the types of munitions or the types of operations it is conducting			0
" still , a doctor familiar with the material said it is not possible to tell , based on pictures of burns , whether white phosphorus was responsible			2
" dead tissue pretty much looks the same , " said dr. @entity75 , president of the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			0
the chemical " can burn down houses and cause horrific burns when it touches the skin , " said @entity80 , senior military analyst at @entity2			0
since january 3 , when @entity3 began its ground offensive in @entity6 , news reports have circulated about the possible use of white phosphorus by the @entity53			1
@entity2 's assertion was supported by munitions experts and some @entity93 doctors , including @entity94 , who said the burns it caused were unlike anything he has seen in 27 years of practice			0
watch footage of burn patients in @entity6 though most severely burned patients have been sent to @entity104 , the ongoing fighting has made it impossible to evacuate all of them , including one man with deep burns over 47 percent of his body , the doctor said			2
white phosphorus is known to burn flesh down to the bone			1
it 's intended to provide illumination or to create a smokescreen in battle			0
under an international protocol ratified by @entity3 in 1995 , the use of such incendiary weapons is allowed when " not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons			1
" there is no prohibition per se against white phosphorus in conflict			2
but the timing and location of its use are restricted			0
for example , it is illegal under the protocol to use white phosphorus against any personnel , civilian or military			1
it can be directed only against military targets			0
international law says incendiary weapons can not be used where civilians are concentrated			0
a house north of @entity19 was hit sunday by something that observers contend may have been white phosphorus			2
" it 's been burning since one o'clock in the morning , " @entity144 told @entity1 11 hours later			0
" if you move it with your feet , it reignites			0
you ca n't put it out with water , only sand			0
" those characteristics match the properties of white phosphorus , which ignites on contact with air .			2
