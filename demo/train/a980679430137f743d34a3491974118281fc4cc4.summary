-- the @entity2 administration asserts @entity3 is " not alone " in planning its proposed @entity9 strikes , though ally countries have yet to formally join the call for limited military action now advanced by the @entity7			1
whether other countries will participate in an @entity3 offensive against @entity9 remains to be seen			2
short of an official @entity7 list of who 's in , analysts and @entity0 correspondents size up which countries may -- or may not -- play a military or diplomatic role in a planned @entity3 - led air assault on @entity9			1
what about the @entity22 , our loyal ally in the @entity25 ? forget it			0
in a staggering setback to prime minister @entity28 , the @entity29 said no to joining a @entity3 assault against @entity9			1
the @entity22 is overwhelmingly against another @entity32 conflict , with only 16 % in favor of militarily punishing the @entity9 regime			2
is there a chance @entity22 legislators might reconsider ? 5 things on @entity9 : @entity2 overseas to developments at home it 's possible , experts say , because @entity2 's strategy to make a public case before @entity45 for a limited @entity9 attack may win favor in @entity48			1
however , @entity28 seemed to quash speculation that there might be a new commons vote wednesday			0
" @entity22 can not be and will not be part of any military action " against @entity9 , he said , adding that he respects the outcome of last week 's vote and " will not be bringing back plans for @entity22 participation in military action			1
" the @entity7 alleges that the @entity9 regime is deploying chemical weapons that are killing innocent children and adults in a civil war that has lasted more than two years			0
" it 'll be interesting to watch in the coming days if the @entity2 administration 's case on chemical weapons reverberates with the @entity48 public , " said @entity64 , senior fellow of the @entity65			0
well , who in @entity48 does support us ? it could be @entity74 , in something of a role reversal from 2003 , when @entity74 declined to join the @entity78 invasion but the @entity22 sent many troops			1
the @entity74 parliament is expected to debate military action against @entity9 this week			1
but there 's not a lot of nationwide support for such an intervention -- only one in three people in @entity74 endorses punishing @entity9			1
what 's the evidence ? but the @entity74 are more open than the @entity90 , who are against it by a 5 - 1 ratio			2
@entity90 chancellor @entity94 , who is facing re-election later this month , said her country wo n't participate in any military action , though she called the plight of the @entity9 people " catastrophic			0
" where does @entity100 stand on all this ? @entity100 , the ultimate @entity3 ally in the @entity32 , has already intervened in the @entity9 conflict but in a measured way , using isolated bombing in instances that @entity100 deemed @entity9 aggression			2
' red line ' debate : are chemical weapons worse ? " they have been doing this tit - for - tat thing , " said @entity112 , @entity32 analyst for the @entity113			0
for now , @entity100 is maintaining a low - profile in the international debate about whether to launch an offensive against @entity9 because it does n't want to further antagonism between it and @entity122 neighbors			2
@entity100 's vast military force -- fighter jets , surveillance , early warning systems -- would be an important asset to @entity3 forces if an attack on @entity9 proceeds			1
" @entity100 is doing its part by keeping quiet , " @entity131 added			0
@entity100 is being supportive behind the scenes			0
what about @entity3 access to @entity137 's air bases ? some @entity137 support will be public , and some will be under the table , said @entity140 , president and ceo of the @entity142			1
the same goes for @entity143 and @entity144 , she said			2
how a no - boots - on - the - ground attack against @entity9 would play out has n't been revealed by the @entity2 administration			0
bombing would likely include missiles launched from the @entity3 warships in the @entity151			0
the use of other countries ' soil in the region for air strikes is uncertain , experts say			0
four questions for backers of @entity9 mission secretary of state @entity161 told @entity7 @entity162 that @entity137 -- along with @entity143 and the @entity163 -- has already offered military assets for any @entity9 attacks , two sources on the call told @entity0 this week			1
if so , @entity137 could play a huge role : there are already two big @entity3 air bases there that could be used by fighter jets , refueling tankers , @entity174 surveillance planes and @entity176 spy aircraft			2
there are also @entity3 defense missile systems on the @entity137 border as a defense against @entity9			1
tell me more about oil - rich @entity143 analysts believe that @entity143 heavily influenced the recent announcement by the @entity185 foreign ministers who called upon the international community to punish the @entity9 regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons			1
is it ' @entity191 ' for @entity2 on @entity9 ? that statement was interpreted as the @entity185 " green - lighting " a military strike against @entity9 without specifically mentioning bombing			0
with its vast air force and bases , @entity143 would offer a lot of resources to @entity201 militaries			0
but it would n't participate directly in any attack on @entity9 because that would inflame a widespread @entity205 antipathy against @entity201 military forces intruding into @entity122 affairs			0
still , @entity143 is a diplomatic heavyweight in the @entity122 world , so the country 's tacit support and money would ease any @entity3 burden if it is forced to act alone against @entity9			1
@entity9 missile strike : what would happen next ? @entity161 told the @entity216 this week that @entity122 countries -- presumably including @entity143 -- have offered to help bear the financial cost of the proposed military offensive against @entity9			1
" that 's how dedicated they are to this , " @entity161 said			0
@entity3 ally @entity144 is in a bind like @entity143 , @entity144 has air bases close to @entity9 's border that could be useful for inserting and extracting special forces and mounting rescue missions for downed pilots			1
@entity144 also hosts @entity3 forces , and together they train rebels for combat in @entity9			1
the @entity144 also allow weapons to flow over its border to the @entity9 opposition , and their country is home to one of the biggest @entity241 operations on @entity9 in the region			2
but @entity144 is perhaps the most vulnerable of @entity3 allies because it 's so close to @entity9 and has declared that it wo n't be a launching pad for @entity9 attacks			1
@entity144 is unlikely to be involved directly in a @entity3 strike against @entity9 because @entity144 could face retaliatory missiles and terror attacks from the @entity9 regime			1
meanwhile , @entity144 is nervous about its own internal tensions arising from @entity253 , including how the country deals with corruption allegations and a not - so - popular king			0
" @entity144 fears @entity9 will escalate horizontally and switch the geography of conflict , " @entity131 said			2
could @entity260 do anything ? @entity260 has been supportive of the @entity9 regime , but if it wanted to assist the @entity3 , it could pull its military advisers out of @entity9 and stop its alleged supplying of arms to the regime			2
@entity260 could also tell @entity9 president @entity265 to hand over power to an interim administration			0
such @entity260 support is unlikely , and the most that the @entity2 administration could expect is @entity260 expressing uncertainty about whether the @entity265 regime is the best to govern @entity9 , as @entity260 did a year ago			0
so what kind of a coalition could we be talking about ? when all is said and done , any @entity3 - led coalition against @entity9 could be one that offers more moral than military support			1
that is still important , especially when the nations act outside the aegis of the @entity283 @entity282			0
" a coalition is political in nature , but the @entity3 would do the heavy lifting militarily , " @entity64 said			0
@entity0 's @entity287 , @entity288 and @entity289 contributed to this story .			0

a @entity3 - led coalition to bomb @entity9 has yet to take shape
@entity22 legislators vote against joining , but experts say it 's possible they may reconsider
the @entity74 @entity300 is expected to take up the @entity3 proposal this week
@entity143 , @entity144 , @entity137 will support @entity3 in different ways , even under the table
