@entity0 , @entity1 -- off the beaten path of the @entity6 theater district , troubadours are resurrecting @entity7 in an adaptation that would make the @entity7 smile			1
the @entity10 has melded " @entity18 " with song and dance performed to music by the band @entity15 and has rendered an energetic , comedic romp entitled " @entity17 of @entity15			1
" troupes and their adaptations of " @entity21 , " as @entity22 coined it , come and go , riffing endlessly on @entity7 's tragedies and comedies , always searching for ways to breathe new life into the iambic pentameter of 500 years ago			1
but the @entity10 , performing at @entity31 producer @entity30 's @entity29 in @entity0 , has come upon an entertaining formula			2
the performers use live music , choreography , improvisation , audience interaction , and no small measure of humor and farce to create an evening of engagement and laughter			2
much of the troupe 's magic comes from its improv , and performers apparently play pranks on one another , such as in one scene when @entity51 's @entity18 toasts @entity53 's @entity52 -- with real booze , not some liquid stage prop			1
" oh , got the real thing ! " @entity51 says , nearly choking , during the march 17 performance			0
" on @entity58 , no less			0
" ( @entity51 , who trained at improv mecca @entity59 , also directs the show			0
) other improvisations are equally witty			0
when @entity66 's @entity65 flubs a line , @entity64 's @entity63 jests him : " @entity65 , you are n't sharp enough -- especially with your lines			2
" ( @entity64 is also the show 's producing director			2
) that may be a bit unfair to @entity66 , whose talents include playing the guitar and singing			0
the integration of @entity15 's ballads , played lived by seven musicians , makes for a nice fit in the romantic comedy narrative			1
add in the troupe 's choreography , and the production is more than just a " free - wheeling , no holds barred ... slapstick " that the stagebill touts			1
the show opens when @entity18 and @entity52 have had enough of another " @entity89 , " a @entity15 standard			1
later , both men fight over @entity92 by serenading her as " @entity93 , " a popular @entity15 ballad			2
among the show stealers are @entity64 's clownish @entity63 and his dog , @entity98 , which is a loveable pug			0
it 's always high risk to bring an animal into a live performance -- for who knows what could go wrong -- but @entity64 is happy to improvise and highlight the what - will - the - dog - do - next suspense			0
@entity64 and @entity98 amaze the audience by exchanging between themselves a high - five -- and then a low - five			0
when crab turns his rump to the audience , with his tail high in the air center stage , @entity64 admonishes the animal with what everyone is looking at but is too polite to express : " why , you 're showing them your evil eye ! " i 'm so sorry , " @entity64 tells the gallery , all laughing			0
the @entity10 's " @entity17 of @entity15 " runs through april 22 at the @entity29 in @entity0 , @entity1 .			1
