-- the first recorded use of the phrase " protest march " was in 1913 to describe a demonstration organized by @entity5 against the @entity8 government 's restrictions on @entity10 nationals			1
after @entity5 was arrested and the protests grew more heated in response , the @entity8 government labeled the gatherings " riots			1
" ever since , impassioned groups of politically similarly situated people have been called either protesters or rioters			2
which phrase you choose mainly depends on where your own political sympathies lie			2
this weekend , after protesters involved in the @entity27 actions were arrested by police , the @entity24 called the demonstration a " near riot " while @entity30 said the occupation involved mostly " beds , kitchens , peaceful barricades " i 'm not going to weigh in the relative merits of the @entity27 protests			1
suffice it to say i 'm sympathetic with their critique that our economy and political system is too beholden to the interests of @entity46 , overlooking or even abusing the middle class and the poor			2
in fact , polls show that more than two - thirds of @entity52 think major corporations , banks and financial institutions have too much power in our society			1
yet i imagine there are some fed - up @entity52 nonetheless scratching their heads as to why a bunch of their fellow citizens are camped out in our nation 's financial headquarters in @entity65			1
but we have a democracy			2
that 's our power , right ? unfortunately , that 's not always enough			0
we know the corporate lobbyists hold disproportionate sway over our elected officials compared with we , the people			0
for instance , members of the congressional supercommittee charged with reaching a bipartisan deficit reduction solution have received $ 41 million from the financial sector during their time in @entity79			1
according to a new report by @entity83 and @entity84 , at least 27 current or former aides to supercommittee members have worked as lobbyists for financial sector interests			0
unfortunately , these dynamics affect both political parties			0
during his first presidential run , @entity89 received more campaign donations from employees of investment banks and hedge funds than any other industry			0
throughout the rest of the world , especially in the @entity99 and @entity100 , ordinary people are rising up together to protest impenetrable and unjust political regimes			1
many of these protests are peaceful			2
sadly , some are not			0
but if you look at people 's movements in places like @entity110 and @entity111 and think they are justified because those nations have entrenched , totalitarian regimes , think again			2
@entity52 's financial and business titans may not use tanks and torture , but their power is nonetheless extraordinary and dangerous			1
if the blatant injustice and inequality of the @entity121 world seems a million miles away , note that according to the @entity123 , income inequality in the @entity52 is greater than in @entity124			1
@entity125 once said , " @entity126 concedes nothing without a demand			0
" @entity125 knew of what he spoke			0
because black people and poor whites were n't even allowed to vote in the early days of our @entity133 , slavery could only be ended through protest			1
throughout the 18th and 19th centuries , black and white @entity52 launched protests and outright revolts against the system of slavery			1
many of those protests were peaceful			2
sadly , some were not			0
but looking back , we do n't condemn @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 for their " riots " -- just as most @entity52 do n't condemn the rev. @entity148 and @entity149 , even though at the time , all these great heroes were attacked and tarnished for their protests			1
what is brave and noble through the distance of history can often seem disorderly and disruptive in the present			1
think of the @entity156 , which helped spark the @entity157			0
the nervous @entity159 ruling class denounced it as a riot			0
and yes , that protest ultimately turned very violent			2
i do not condone violence			0
i believe in the power of protests to confront the ugliness of inequality and injustice with the beauty of people peacefully coming together and simply but strongly demanding change			1
then again , i understand that when people are angry , it 's hard to be quiet			0
in @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity175 is facing foreclosure and ejection from her home after falling on hard times			0
@entity175 is staying in her home until she , her brother and her elderly parents are forcibly removed by @entity184 , the bank to which she has repeatedly appealed for lenience			0
@entity175 is actively resisting the orders of police and government officials			0
is that violence ? will it be violent when the bank and cops remove her ? where do we draw the line ? the grandfather of protest -- or riots , depending on your perspective -- @entity5 deeply deplored violence			2
but @entity5 also said , " it is better to be violent , if there is violence in our hearts , than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence			0
" indeed , people in the @entity52 and across the globe are feeling increasingly impotent in the face of the growing power and wealth of @entity46 , dimming the rest of our prospects for a prosperous future			1
in the face of such injustice , i do n't wonder why people protest			1
i wonder why more people do n't join them			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity228 : " @entity27 " is part of @entity52 *tradition* of protest
past protests seen now as noble were disorderly and disruptive at the time , she writes
@entity228 : protests a choice when injustice so entrenched , a vote is not enough
