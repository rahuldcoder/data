three republicans with lofty aspirations nearly had their political careers derailed over risky positions on immigration			2
but the crisis on the southern border involving an influx of nearly 60,000 migrant children this year from @entity9 may help @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 repair a broken trust on immigration with conservatives			1
all three are positioning themselves in a way that could help them make peace			0
@entity12 , as governor of @entity20 , is out in front publicly since his state is directly affected , while @entity11 , a @entity23 senator , and @entity10 , a former @entity23 governor , have been relatively quiet			1
and @entity25 strategist @entity24 said that 's ok			0
" i do n't think you have to play a leading role on every issue , " she said			2
@entity11 took a risk both @entity11 and @entity10 have been leaders on immigration in the past			1
@entity11 took a risk last year by taking a leadership role in crafting a comprehensive reform bill that passed the @entity37 but crashed and burned in the @entity38			2
conservatives attacked him for supporting " amnesty , " their opinion of providing a path to legal status for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the @entity45			0
@entity11 then distanced himself from the @entity37 package that he helped broker in favor of a piecemeal approach backed by some @entity50 that also has gone nowhere			2
@entity10 : a compassionate tone @entity10 offered a compassionate tone to the immigration debate before the border crisis made headlines			1
in april , he said many immigrants come to the @entity45 illegally as " an act of love " and " an act of commitment to your family			0
" he admitted that he might be stepping on a land mine before he made the statement			0
" but the way i look at this , and i 'm going to say this , and it 'll be on tape and so be it			0
" now avoiding risk @entity10 , whose immigration stance is at odds with many in his party , has avoided risk by not addressing the southern border issue until now			1
in a statement to @entity78 , @entity10 placed the onus on president @entity80 to address the situation but also said the minor immigrants , many of them who crossed the border unaccompanied , should be sent home			1
that 's in line with many @entity25 , especially conservatives , as well as the stated position of the @entity38			0
how that is accomplished most effectively , however , is a sticking point at the moment			0
" it is clear we have a humanitarian crisis on our border			2
governor @entity10 believes president @entity80 must step up and show leadership			2
these children must be returned to their home countries , " his spokeswoman , @entity98 , said			0
@entity10 then pushed for an immigration overhaul			1
" ultimately , we must overhaul this nation 's broken immigration system to prevent situations like this in the future , " @entity98 said			0
@entity10 has been active in the political arena , however , recently endorsing and campaigning with @entity37 candidate @entity109 , a @entity25 running in the first presidential primary state of @entity112			1
immigrants or refugees ? a different with political consequences quiet , but not skirting the issue as @entity117 is tasked with coming up with a solution to the border crisis			1
@entity11 has mostly taken a back seat			2
that 's a different tactic than he took during immigration reform , where he was a leader in crafting the @entity37 bill			0
the @entity23 senator has put out 80 press releases since the beginning of june			0
but not one has addressed the border situation			0
but the son of @entity131 immigrants has n't completely skirted the issue , either			0
in an interview with a @entity135 affiliate in @entity136 this month , @entity11 said the children must be treated with compassion , but like @entity10 and the @entity38 believe " they will have to return			1
" @entity11 also said he 's opposed to @entity80 's $ 3.7 billion emergency funding request to @entity117 that includes money to care for immigrant kids while they await legal proceedings to determine whether they can stay in the country			2
@entity11 said money needs to be spent on " permanent border security measures			1
" he also told conservative talk show host @entity147 that the current immigration crisis should be " a catalyst " for securing the border			1
@entity12 's approach @entity12 's 2012 presidential run nosedived in part after he said in a @entity25 debate that people who do n't support giving children of undocumented immigrants in - state college tuition do n't " have a heart			1
" @entity12 has been far more aggressive than @entity11 and @entity10 with his state @entity160 in the migrant crisis			1
@entity25 have followed his lead			0
he confronted the @entity38 and made his points directly to @entity80 in a meeting this month			0
@entity12 also has checked the " secure border " box			1
" if you have a patient who is bleeding profusely , the first thing you have to do is stop the bleeding , and that 's the reason we have been so adamant about securing the border , " @entity12 said recently on @entity169 ' " @entity168			1
" although he supported a secure border before , his laser - like focus on the issue during the current crisis , despite the numerous other factors that are involved , has endeared him to reform skeptics			1
the lay of the land while the three have adopted different strategies and their professional roles are different , they are positioning themselves in a way that may appease many @entity25 voters			0
while more republicans than @entity193 support border security as a solution , the conservative position has become even firmer since the border crisis began			1
according to a @entity198 poll this week , 17 % of @entity45 think immigration is the most important issue facing the country right now			2
and @entity203 poll found that most @entity45 think the children involved should be deported			0
in addition , @entity203 found fewer republicans supported a path to citizenship -- 64 % - in february compared to 54 % now			0
and among the more conservative part of the @entity25 base , only 41 % now support a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants , compared to 56 % five months ago			0
the witch 's brew : desperation , hope and children on the border not in my backyard : communities protest surge of immigrant kids unintended consequences : 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis			1

the *potential* presidential candidates have been *criticized* by conservatives over immigration
@entity10 and @entity11 , moderates on immigration , keeping a low profile in border crisis
@entity20 gov. @entity12 , another relative moderate on the issue , has been more aggressive
