-- a couple years ago , a @entity2 researcher named @entity3 embarked on a personal experiment : he would wear a video camera around his neck all the time and keep this " life recorder " always turned on , so it would record everything he did			2
it was like an external memory drive for his brain , he wrote in a book called " @entity14			0
" sounds pretty sci - fi , right ? not so much			2
the " real - time sharing " updates @entity17 announced thursday aim to do something quite similar -- only for the internet instead of in real life			1
before we get into the details and implications , here 's a " real - time " example of how the updates , which are rolling out in the coming weeks , will work : as i write this , i 'm listening to the band @entity30 on an @entity20 music service called @entity32			1
because i 've updated my @entity17 page ( here 's a @entity36 article on how to do that if you 're interested ) and because i 've logged in to @entity32 with my @entity17 identity , every song i listen to is automatically shared to @entity17			1
suddenly , my listening experience is n't private			0
all my @entity17 friends are watching			1
chances are this will affect people 's behavior online			2
if you 're a closet fan of @entity50 or @entity51 or @entity52 ( i 'm all three ) , then you 'll just have to stop listening to those potentially mockable artists -- either that , or all your @entity17 friends will be chiming in with comments : " omg , you 're listening to that ? ! " in the old world of @entity17 , i would have to click that i " liked " a song for it to show up on my @entity17 profile page			1
that 's something you have to think about : " ok , i really like this song , and i really want all of my friends to know that i 'm listening to it right now			0
" now , sharing is both passive and automatic			0
it 's a choice you make in advance -- one time -- and never again			2
and so it goes with all kinds of the new " real - time " apps			1
since i 've logged in to @entity72 with @entity17 , every time i read an article on that site , it goes to my timeline			1
the same is true for @entity77 and tv shows			0
and for the internet game " @entity79			0
" when i play a @entity83 - style word in that game , it will show up on @entity17 , along with an image of the current playing board			1
for @entity17 , this is obviously a good thing			1
the site 's goal -- as postulated in " @entity90 " -- always has been to get people to share more and more information about themselves			0
that 's bound to happen in this new auto - share era			0
it 's also ostensibly good for makers of @entity17 apps			1
in a presentation in @entity101 on thursday , @entity99 ceo @entity98 said he was initially skeptical of the deal , since it would give @entity17 so much information about @entity99 's customers ' preferences for movies and tv shows			1
he decided it was smart , however , after he used the real - time app integration for himself and decided it was so addictive that it would doubtlessly result in more people watching more videos on @entity99 -- a good thing for him , of course			1
but the benefits for @entity17 users are less clear			1
tech bloggers and analysts worry these automatic , real - time updates will kick off a new level of oversharing			1
if you were sick of hearing about what your aunt had for breakfast and who your co-workers had " friended " on @entity17 , wait until you know every single song they 've listened to and every single movie they 've watched			1
" it 's not hard to imagine @entity17 sharing more than doubling after the f8 launches , " @entity137 wrote at the blog @entity139			2
" millions of tiny little actions are going to move from implicit to explicit			0
you can start to see why @entity17 enabled its ' ticker ' news feed earlier this week ( that 's the dizzying real - time stream that many users have been complaining about )			1
there 's going to be a ton of information flying by			0
" with every one of these " passive " shares , users are teaching @entity17 a little more about themselves			2
that 's incredibly valuable to advertisers , who can use that data for target marketing			0
it 's also a potential invasion of privacy , @entity156 of the @entity157 writes at @entity160			0
" since a one - time click will grant a persistent permission to any app to collect and disclose personal information on your behalf , @entity17 will have to make sure its users fully understand the implications of these new apps before roll - out , or risk another round of privacy backlash , " he says			1
@entity156 sides with @entity17 on the changes , though			2
" for @entity17 , of course , the point is for you to provide them more data about your life , which they can use to serve you ads you 'll be more likely to engage with ( which makes them more money )			2
but there 's potentially real value here too , if people can discover ways to share their music - listening and cooking habits with friends in a perhaps lighter - touch way			2
" passive sharing is n't a privacy invasion , but it is " killing taste , " @entity191 wrote at @entity195			0
" why do you share a story , video , or photo ? because you want your friends to see it			0
and why do you want your friends to see it ? because you think they 'll get a kick out of it , " he says			0
" i know this sounds obvious , but it 's somehow eluded @entity208 that sharing is fundamentally about choosing			0
you experience a huge number of things every day , but you choose to tell your friends about only a fraction of them , because most of what you do is n't worth mentioning			0
" the @entity214 notes that @entity17 tried something like this in 2007			2
" the new features may prove controversial , " @entity216 says			0
" in some ways they resemble @entity220 , a failed project from 2007 in which sites like @entity223 automatically posted updates to @entity17 when a person bought something			1
@entity220 was canceled after public protests over a lack of privacy controls			0
" we 'll see how the public reacts to what @entity208 calls " real - time serendipity " when these changes launch in a few weeks			1
but if these changes stand , and if people do sign up for these new - new @entity17 apps with auto - share built in , then all of us may soon have a semi-public record of everything we do online			1
just like @entity3 , the researcher with a camera around his neck .			0

@entity17 *unveils* " real - time " features
the changes will roll out over coming weeks
new apps will post to @entity17 automatically , if *approved*
the result : @entity17 is watching your every online move
