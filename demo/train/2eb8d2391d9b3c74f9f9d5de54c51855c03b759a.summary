the children of an elderly @entity2 couple who passed away months apart in late 2012 and early 2013 are blaming their deaths on a restaurant chain 's meatloaf			1
@entity6 and @entity7 say a tainted meal that their parents shared from a local @entity11 restaurant in october 2012 made them so " violently ill " that it ultimately led to their deaths , according to a lawsuit they 've filed against the @entity15 - based chain			2
according to the complaint , about nine hours after consuming a meal of meatloaf , mashed potatoes and gravy , broccoli and a roll , @entity23 -- who went by " @entity25 " -- " fell violently ill " shortly before @entity28 " also became violently ill but was able to call 911 for ambulance transport for both			2
" both were told by emergency room staff at @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity2 , that they had suffered from food poisoning " from consuming the tainted meal from @entity11			1
" the next day , the children allege that their dad -- who went by the nickname " @entity39 " -- " suffered a stroke after becoming violently ill from consuming the tainted meal from @entity11 , " resulting in both parents being moved into a rehabilitation facility			2
about two months later , @entity25 , who served in the @entity44 in the 1980s , died in hospice care			0
