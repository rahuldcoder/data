-- a @entity2 chief in a town far from the bustling capital foiled a predawn robbery recently using @entity6 , highlighting the far - reaching effects of social media in areas that do n't have access to the @entity11			1
chief @entity12 said he got a call in the dead of the night that thieves had broken into a neighbor 's house			0
he turned to @entity6 , which allows users to send messages in 140 characters or less , to reach his community instantly			0
" thieves in @entity25 's living room , let 's help him out please , " he tweeted in @entity28 , the local language			0
local residents , who subscribe to his tweets through a free text messaging service , jumped into action			2
they surrounded the house , sending the thugs fleeing into the night			0
he later sent a message thanking the community in his town of @entity41 for coming out			2
while @entity6 has been associated with bolstering uprisings and anti-government protests in @entity46 , its use is expanding in the continent , with communities in remote areas tailoring the global service and making it work for local audiences			2
in the town 100 miles from @entity56 , a majority of residents do n't have access to computers , the @entity11 or smart phones			1
the sporadic cyber cafes strewn across the landscape charge for internet access			0
however , almost every household has a cell phone and text messages are a major form of communication in the nation			1
" every time we have barazas ( meetings ) twice a month , i make attendees subscribe to my tweets using their regular sms or text messaging services , " @entity12 said by phone from the town			1
" it has not only saved on the cost of fliers , it has also allowed us to save trees and contribute to green efforts			0

the chief can send them any time using his smart phone			1
" it 's all about empowering the local person on the ground with information , " @entity12 said by phone			0
" before i decided on this , i asked around -- how can i reach all my people in one time at no cost to them ? " @entity12 leads a community of 28,000 residents and while his @entity6 account shows he has about 400 followers -- or people who get his tweets online -- the chief said those who receive his tweets via text message are in the thousands			1
" they just do n't register as followers because they do n't have @entity6 accounts , " he said			0
" a lot of people in town get the text tweets , even the thieves and police			2
" the chief 's use of social media allows him to reach everyone at the same time , and residents say the effort is paying off			2
" he has really helped us know what 's going on around us			0
now we know to expect a message from the chief any time , so we do n't turn off our phones at night , " said @entity125 , who lives in the town			1
in addition to rallying the community , the chief also uses social media to share doses of encouragement and send out alerts about missing animals			1
" there 's a donkey that 's been tied under a tree for days , we do n't know its owner , help please , " he tweeted recently after a message about a missing sheep that was later found			2

@entity149 and @entity150 follow in the list of top five most active countries			0
the report this month by @entity154 and the trend - analysis group @entity156 based its conclusion on a three - month study of tweets from the continent			2

" we saw the pivotal role of @entity6 in the events in @entity169 last year , but it is clear that @entity46 's @entity6 revolution is really just beginning , " @entity164 , head of @entity56 , said in a statement			0
