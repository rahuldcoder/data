the 31 - year - old could be out for months after fracturing a shin bone in his leg when he was thrown from his @entity13 in the second session ahead of qualifying at @entity15			1
he had an operation on saturday afternoon , the official @entity4 web site reported , after being flown to @entity18 in @entity19 and then moved to the orthopedic trauma center			2
" it 's an injury more serious than we thought , because it 's an exposed fracture with the bone protruding from the skin , " doctor @entity22 of the sport 's traveling medics @entity21 told motogp.com			0
" we have reduced the fracture , which fortunately has not affected any blood vessels or nerves			0
" doctor @entity33 , who performed the operation , said @entity2 would be ruled out for at least two months			2

we are confident that @entity2 will be able to leave the hospital in a week to 10 days , able to put weight on the leg with the aid of crutches			2
" it is difficult to say how long the post surgery rehabilitation will take			0
but i think that we can reasonably think of six weeks of partial weight - bearing with crutches , after which @entity2 needs to be re-evaluated			0
" @entity2 has not missed a race since his debut in the 125cc class in @entity61 in 1996 , but his record run of 230 successive gp starts will now end			1
