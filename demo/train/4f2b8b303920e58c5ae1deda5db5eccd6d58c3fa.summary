@entity0 -- in the final hours before $ 85 billion in widely disliked spending cuts began to take effect friday , top political leaders did virtually nothing to defuse @entity0 's latest self - imposed fiscal crisis			1
@entity7 blamed @entity8 , @entity8 blamed @entity7 , and both sides prepared for the next showdown -- a possible government shutdown on march 27			1
here are the highlights of friday 's partisan skirmish : last minute @entity15 meeting achieves nothing president @entity17 , vice president @entity18 , senate majority leader @entity19 , senate minority leader @entity20 , house speaker @entity21 , and @entity15 minority leader @entity22 huddled behind closed doors for less than an hour friday morning			1
as expected , the meeting did n't accomplish anything			1
the gathering was " subdued " a @entity8 congressional aide told @entity1			2
@entity7 insisted once again that the cuts could be avoided if only @entity8 would compromise and agree to higher taxes on the rich			1
" none of this is necessary , " @entity17 told reporters after the meeting			1
" it 's happening because ( of ) a choice that @entity8 in @entity37 have made			2
they 've allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful ( tax ) loophole to help reduce the deficit			2
" the country " will get through this , " he insisted			0
but " it 's just dumb			0
" republicans once again ruled out new taxes , and said they had already done their part			0
" the ( @entity8 - controlled ) @entity15 should n't have to pass a third bill before the ( @entity7 - controlled ) @entity52 does anything , " said @entity21 , referring to @entity8 - drafted legislation that died in the last @entity37			1
" @entity54 has laid out a plan to avoid the ( current cuts )			2
... this discussion about revenue , in my view , is over			0
it 's about taking on the spending problem here in @entity0			2
" the current pending budget cuts are the result of an ongoing partisan impasse whose origins stem from an august 2011 agreement to increase the debt ceiling			2
@entity17 : i do n't have horns and i 'm not a @entity72 " i recognize that it is very hard for @entity8 leaders to be perceived as making concessions to me , " @entity17 told reporters			1
" sometimes i reflect -- is there something else i can do to make these guys ... not to paint horns on my head ? " the president bemoaned his inability to force @entity8 leaders to cut a deal			1
" i know that this has been some of the conventional wisdom that 's been floating around @entity0 ... that i should , somehow , you know , do a @entity72 mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what 's right , " @entity17 said			1
" if there was a secret way to ( convince them ) , i would have tried it			0
i would have done it			0
what i can do is , i can make the best possible argument			0
and i can offer concessions , and i can offer compromise			0
" @entity21 : @entity15 will try to avoid a government shutdown the next big date on the fiscal calendar is march 27 , the day @entity0 's spending authority expires for the rest of the current fiscal year			1
@entity37 has to pass a bill extending federal spending authority or the government will shut down			2
" @entity54 is going to move a ( legislation ) next week to fund the government past march 27 , " @entity21 said			1
" i hope the @entity52 will follow suit			0
... i 'm hopeful that we wo n't have to deal with the threat of a government shutdown while we 're dealing with the ( spending cuts ) at the same time			1
" and speaking of that shutdown ... as march 27 approaches , lawmakers will continue to fight over the $ 85 billion in spending cuts			1
should a new government funding bill include the current cuts ? should it substitute another $ 85 billion in cuts ? should greater flexibility be provided to the @entity126 or other departments as they implement the cuts ? with less than a month to go before the shutdown deadline , these questions are already dividing legislators and could derail coming shutdown talks			1
@entity7 have so far largely resisted the notion of greater flexibility in the implementation of the cuts			2
on thursday , they rejected a @entity52 @entity8 bill that would have given @entity17 more flexibility in deciding which programs to slice			1
among other things , @entity7 worry that would let the @entity8 off the hook while placing responsibility for the cuts clearly on the president 's shoulders			1
critics in both parties consider the idea an abdication of @entity37 's power of the purse			0
" flexibility is not a substitute for money , " @entity155 chairman @entity154 , @entity156 , told @entity1 's @entity157 on friday			2
flexibility " would be like being on the @entity161			0
we 've hit the iceberg , and flexibility says what deck to you want to be on as you sink ? do you want to be near the kitchen ? do you want to be near the band ? " " what we want is a solution with money , " @entity154			0
" not a sham solution with the illusion of a management approach			0
" @entity176 : no more taxes or back - room deals " over the coming weeks , we 'll have the opportunity to ensure funding is at the level we promised while working on solutions for making spending reductions more intelligently than the president 's across - the - board cuts , " the @entity52 minority leader said in a written statement friday afternoon			1
" but i want to make clear that any solutions will be done through the regular order , with input from both sides of the aisle in public debate			0
i will not be part of any back - room deal and i will absolutely not agree to increase taxes , " he added			2
@entity22 : @entity15 @entity8 fears " marketplace of ideas " @entity15 @entity7 " have a proposal that would have been better " than the current cuts , @entity22 told reporters on @entity200			1
the proposal " has a revenue piece , " she noted , but @entity7 " have n't been able to bring it up			2
we 've ... tried three times in the last two months			0
" " the @entity8 , i do n't know what they 're afraid of , " the @entity208 @entity207 said			1
" this is the marketplace of ideas			0
are they afraid that some of their members might vote for it ? " federal employees brace for furloughs several @entity220 employees told @entity1 they received letters thursday warning of expected cuts and furloughs due to the imminent cuts			0
prospective furlough notices also went out to 115,000 @entity228 employees , according to a senior official at the department			0
finally , if you 're planning to visit the @entity200 soon ... prepare for longer lines			0
the following message went out friday from @entity37 's @entity234 : the imminent spending cuts " will require modifying points of access for members , congressional staff and guests to the @entity241 @entity240			1
" at this time it is anticipated that the @entity244 will be required to close some entrance doors and exterior checkpoints , and either suspend or modify the hours of operation for some of the @entity241 @entity240 posts located inside and outside of the ( @entity250 ) and office buildings			0
these changes will most likely take place within the next two weeks , and the congressional community will be notified in a timely manner before implementation			0
" @entity1 's @entity257 , @entity157 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0
