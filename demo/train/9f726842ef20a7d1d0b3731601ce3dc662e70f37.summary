-- there 's a massive telescope on the drawing board that has n't even started construction yet , but when it 's finished in 2024 , it 'll generate more data in a single day than the entire @entity6			1
for scientists to ensure they 'll be able to handle all that raw information , they need to start working on new computing technologies now			2
fortunately , @entity11 is on it			2
the computing giant is collaborating with @entity14 ( the @entity15 ) to develop the next - generation computer tech needed to handle the colossal amount of data captured by the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , a new radio telescope that will spread sensing equipment over a span 3,000 kilometers wide , or about the width of the continental @entity24 " one of the goals is to search what happened at the time of the @entity30 , 13 billion years ago , " @entity11 researcher @entity25 told @entity0			1
" we need to figure out what technology needs to be chosen in order to build this large antenna			2
" the project is called @entity35 , and it 's challenged to find a way to capture and process approximately one exabyte every day , which works out to about twice the amount of data that 's generated every day by the @entity41 , @entity11 says			1
to do that in a way that does n't consume a massive amount of energy , @entity11 will need to develop some entirely new processing architectures before construction on the telescope begins in 2017			1
" we need to be very creative , " says @entity25			0
" if we were to use standard servers of today , we 'd need millions of them			0
they would use so much space and use so much energy that we could n't afford to build the machines let alone operate them			0
" while the project has only just been announced , @entity11 already has some ideas in the hopper			2
specifically , it 'll be looking at novel ways of stacking chips ( today 's chips are flat , though stacking or " 3d " tech is around the corner ) and using optical technology for interconnects , something the company has already had some success with			0
the promising new conductive material graphene , however , probably wo n't play a part			1
" graphene will not be available in time to build something we start in 2017 , " says @entity25			0
" but it might be available for a later generation			0
the expectation is that we will go with the traditional cmos process			0
" see also : @entity11 : mind - reading machines will change our lives even though the new computing tech has n't even been invented yet , it 'll ironically still rely on one of the oldest storage technologies in existence : magnetic tape			1
@entity25 says tape simply ca n't be matched by newer storage mediums since it 's so cost - , space - and power - efficient			2
the project wo n't exclusively use tape for storage , though , also relying on phase - change media and solid - state drives			1
" we 're looking at new memory technologies , " says @entity25 , " but at the end of the day most of the data likely will remain on tape because it 's still the most cost - effective storage medium			1
tape will be around for a long time			0
" the @entity19 is n't planned to be completed until 2024 , but the technologies that @entity11 creates to service it will have the potential to change entire industries in the meantime , dealing with big - data problems that the world is just now encountering			1
it 's possible the social networks and search engines of the future will be powered by @entity11 's coming tech or something like it , enabling them to process an entire @entity6 's worth of data for anyone and everyone			1

@entity11 is *teaming* up with @entity14 to develop what is needed to handle data captured by @entity19
the new technology will still rely on one of the oldest storage technologies : magnetic tape
the @entity19 wo n't be completed until 2024 , but the process has the potential to change industries
