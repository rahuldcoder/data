-- it happens every so often : a military sexual assault scandal hits the headlines			1
most recently , an @entity5 general decided to pardon an officer convicted of rape			2
then came revelations that not one but two of the service members that the military assigned to prevent sex abuse are under investigation for perpetrating it			1
and in light of a new @entity18 report estimating the number of military sexual assaults at 26,000 a year -- about half of them against men -- this time around , even many in the military community agree there is a problem that wo n't go away and ca n't be ignored			1
@entity28 is reacting , as it often does to headlines , by proposing reforms			1
but the current crop of ideas misses the mark			0
@entity34 trained to protect victims faces sexual assault allegations the bills primarily propose changes to a commander 's authority to start or control cases in the military criminal justice system			1
but courts martial , with their due process and proof beyond a reasonable doubt , will always be too rare to make a difference			0
what changed the face of civilian employment was a civil legal approach -- sexual harassment law -- that made it cost money when employees are assaulted			1
this approach should n't be sidelined in addressing the military sexual assault problem			1
the civil legal system reaches people who probably wo n't see a criminal prosecution			1
it reaches people such as @entity62 , who was sexually assaulted by several co-workers on an offshore oil rig in the @entity65			0
it reaches people such as @entity68 , who was 19 when she started work at a bank and the manager demanded that she sleep with him			0
the civil legal solution gives voice to workers who are not that different from the military members who face a command gone wrong : people working long hours , with few options , sometimes living at work , sometimes immigrants with nowhere else to go			1
the civil system balances workers ' needs against legitimate business concerns -- to give managers authority -- by making the employer pay if managers abuse that authority			1
the employer has an economic incentive to make sure that does n't happen			0
after officer charged in sex assault , military faces questions this law changed what people thought was right			2
a friend told me that in the 1960s , a teacher told her she needed to sleep with him to pass			0
she said : " we just called that life			0
" now , in the civilian world , it 's called sexual harassment , and it 's illegal			2
the military has n't had the benefit of that change			2
civilian judges ( not @entity28 , and not the military ) made up special military immunities , loosely called the @entity117 doctrine , to block it			1
it 's time to overrule them			0
the civil legal approach can nip problems in the bud			1
it can stop a predator who is testing the waters or change a command environment that has lost sight of the need to treat all of its personnel professionally			0
if service members had the same rights as other employees to bring civil lawsuits , victims would have direct power to challenge abuses of authority			1
they would not have to wait for government officials to take up their case , and they might not have to wait until something as horrific as a criminal rape happened to them			2
military rape victims : stop blaming us but does n't sexual harassment mean policing petty slights and awkward jokes ? that 's a myth			1
even in the civilian workplace , to win you have to show behavior that is severe or pervasive to the objective observer -- something so serious or so frequent that it significantly alters working conditions			0
the military is not the civilian workplace , and its unique needs have to be considered carefully in any reform , whether criminal or civil			1
civil actions are , after all , potentially less disruptive than outside prosecutors and anonymous tips			2
what happens next should come from a partnership between the uniformed services and civilian experts			0
but it should look more broadly at solutions that go beyond the latest scandal			0
of course , some people think it would be unfair to make the military change			0
boys will be boys , the thinking goes			0
when i joined the military , many of my contemporaries cringed , fearing the worst , but they were wrong : the men i served with met the highest standards of professionalism			0
to expect anything less is to undersell our men , and women , in uniform			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

recently , two military sexual assault scandals hit the headlines
@entity189 : @entity28 should look beyond the military criminal justice system
she says the military should use civil legal solution on sexual assault cases
@entity189 : if service members can file civil lawsuits , victims can directly challenge abuser
