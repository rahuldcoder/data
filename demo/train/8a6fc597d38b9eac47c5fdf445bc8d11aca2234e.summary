-- you may have never heard of @entity2 and @entity3			1
that 's because they offered encrypted ( secure ) e-mail services , something most @entity8 have probably never thought about needing , or wanting			1
in recent days , @entity2 closed shop reportedly in response to @entity8 government pressure to hand over customer data , including those of @entity14 , who used the e-mail provider			1
@entity3 , which is used by activists , journalists and diplomats , shut down its e-mail service on its own volition because it wanted to prevent spying			1
while these small companies have the courage to stand up for their customers ' privacy , big companies like @entity23 and @entity24 and others seem to be on the sidelines			2
opinion : the @entity32 is a surveillance state we seem to be of several minds about government surveillance of our communications			1
but most people want the government , at least in justified cases , to be able to read the e-mail of those legitimately suspected of planning serious crimes			1
and most people also find the details of electronic surveillance worrying and complicated , and would prefer not to think about them at all			1
it 's easier to stick your head in the sand			0
but that would be a mistake			0
e-mail privacy matters because our intellectual privacy matters			1
the ability to confidentially share ideas and information between friends , confidantes and loved ones is the hallmark of a free society			0
our communications are the foundation of our political freedoms			0
they must be inaccessible to the government unless it can prove to a neutral judge that surveillance is warranted , which means more than " relevance " to an investigation and more than mere curiosity			2
opinion : @entity79 secrets kill our trust governments that have the power to secretly watch their citizens and are not subject to meaningful legal constraint have proven , time and time again , that this power can be abused			1
just look at our own history			0
@entity90 's @entity89 put the rev. @entity91 under surveillance , seeking to discredit him politically			2
this was part of a broader program called @entity96			0
@entity90 told @entity89 agents to " expose , disrupt , misdirect , discredit , or otherwise neutralize " the activities of a wide range of individuals and groups , including communists , civil rights organizations , @entity105 groups , and so on			2
when earlier this year @entity14 leaked to the world @entity79 's massive surveillance programs such as @entity108 and @entity109 , we were shocked			2
but more revelations kept coming			0
just the other day , the @entity112 reported that the @entity79 had broken its own permissive rules on surveillance thousands of times each year since 2008			2
a society that can not trust its citizens with ideas -- dissenting , different , or even dangerous -- is a society that is incapable of governing itself			2
it 's in this context that we should understand the importance of the recent closures of @entity2 and @entity3 's e-mail service			1
our government has the power to secretly compel e-mail providers to allow surveillance			1
these secret powers are frequently subject to minimal legal checks , and they allow the government to put gag orders on e-mail providers who object to turning over the records of their customers ' communications			2
when e-mail providers build their systems in ways to ensure privacy ( such as by not collecting metadata or by using strong encryption ) , they come under government pressure , as @entity2 found out to its dismay			1
how can we protect e-mail privacy in ways that give the government the power ( subject to the meaningful rule of law ) to investigate serious crimes ? we could let the government record everything , see everything and know everything			1
this seems to be the position of some government officials , but it would be the end of privacy ( and self - government ) as we know it			2
if we know the state is watching , we will censor what we do , what we say , and possibly even what we think			0
on the other hand , we could put our communications under strong legal or technological protection ( like cryptography ) subject to no government access			0
this would guarantee strong privacy , but it could unreasonably handicap the government from legitimate law enforcement and counter-terrorism purposes			0
there is a middle way			0
we should presume the privacy of e-mail and other communications , and we should require the government to get warrants supported by probable cause before it can read our mail , track our movements and use our communications data to construct a map of everyone we know and when we talk to them			1
this is the traditional way we 've protected communications privacy , and it 's a good way			0
but this requires recognizing a few things			0
total surveillance of our communications is illegitimate , but so is secret surveillance			0
in a democracy committed to civil liberties , the basic contours of government power must be known by the people , so that the people can agree to them			1
it 's not enough for government agencies to raise the specter of public safety and say " trust us			0
" a common response to this argument is the idea that making government surveillance powers public makes it easier for criminals and terrorists to commit crimes , and harder for the police to do their jobs			0
this is correct , but we need to acknowledge that privacy is a civil liberty , and civil liberties are inefficient			1
we tolerate free speech , the freedom from searches and seizures , jury trials , and the privilege against self - incrimination ( among others ) in spite of these costs because we 've learned the hard way that the alternative is worse			0
governments that are too efficient abuse their powers , often by trampling political dissent and civil liberties			1
it 's the difference between a police state and a free state			0
we ca n't ignore the threat to our civil liberties by giving the government vast powers any more than we can ignore the fact that we live in a dangerous world			1
striking the right balance might be hard , but it is part of the price we have to pay for political freedom			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .			2

@entity2 , a secure e-mail service , chose to shut down rather than give customer data to the state
@entity253 : e-mail privacy matters because our intellectual privacy matters
he says time and again governments that secretly watch their citizens abuse power
@entity269 : in a democracy with civil liberties , people have a right to know about surveillance
