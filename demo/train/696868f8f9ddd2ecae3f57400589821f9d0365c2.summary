the latest @entity1 cartoon , produced after last week 's horrific attacks on the @entity5 magazine 's offices , literally adds insult to injury			0
admittedly a portrait in mixed messages , the cover reads " all is forgiven " above a drawing of the @entity13 , who is holding a " @entity15 " sign			0
who , exactly , is supposed to be doing the forgiving and who must be forgiven is not clear			0
@entity19 , a writer with @entity1 , said the cover means the magazine 's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings			0
but the cover could also be interpreted as @entity13 saying he forgives the cartoonists in a way the terrorists , obviously , did not			0
but the cartoons are somewhat irrelevant			0
as @entity32 analyst @entity31 has argued , they were just an excuse for @entity35 zealots to further widen and exploit the perceived gulf between @entity35 and " the @entity37			1
" @entity31 writes , " @entity38 wants to mentally colonize @entity39 muslims , but faces a wall of disinterest			0
but if it can get @entity43 @entity39 to be beastly to ethnic @entity35 on the grounds that they are @entity35 , it can start creating a common political identity around grievance against discrimination			2
this is why it is baffling that political voices around the world , especially conservatives , have argued that we must show our support for @entity1 and free speech by reprinting the magazine 's offensive cartoons			1
remember , this is a publication few outside @entity39 had heard of before it was targeted and even fewer had read -- and arguably one that many would have taken offense at in a different context			0
in fact , in a line of thinking best articulated by @entity67 columnist and @entity6 contributor @entity68 , the violent reaction to @entity1 's offensive cartoons not only justifies but also somehow demands that we not only continue but also ramp up that offense as a form of protest			2
" if a large enough group of someones is willing to kill you for saying something , then it 's something that almost certainly needs to be said , " wrote @entity68			0
in other words , the violent reaction to something offensive not only retroactively justifies the offense in the first place but valorizes its rationale going forward ? some have indeed argued that because some radical islamists resort to violence it justifies not only broad offenses and smears of the entire religion but also thinking of such smears against @entity35 as different from those directed at @entity96 or @entity97			1
this ignores , for example , mass murderer @entity100 , who left a 1,500 page manifesto proclaiming himself " 100 % a @entity97 " and advancing his vision of a " monocultural @entity103			2
" in 2011 , @entity100 killed 77 people in @entity105			0
does that attack justify blasphemy against @entity97 and make it incumbent on all of us to increase such blasphemy as a form of protest ? the likely response -- that violence inspired by @entity97 or @entity96 is somehow an exception while violence inspired by @entity35 is a rule -- i s merely a way of justifying in hindsight and in perpetuity smears against a group one has already decided to hate			1
as @entity124 at the @entity125 has noted , right - wing fascists in @entity39 and @entity103 more broadly share an organizing principle with jihadists : " that there is an apocalyptic war between @entity103 and @entity35			1
" blanket incriminations of the whole of @entity35 based on the acts of zealots help feed the premise			2
so do cartoons that blaspheme the @entity13			0
though it 's perverse to demand all @entity35 apologize or account for the acts of radicals within their faith , since the @entity5 attacks such demands have been made and plenty of moderate @entity35 have spoken out			2
and yet perhaps part of the reason we do n't hear enough from these voices is that they simply do n't fit the narrative fueled by the zealots in @entity35 and " the @entity37 " and happily covered by the apocalypse - loving media			1
this would also explain why the media and " the @entity37 " are still fixated on the slaying of 17 people in @entity39 and paying infinitely less attention to as many as 2,000 people killed in @entity158 by @entity159			1
it falls outside the " us versus them " frame — and is further evidence that , as protesters in the @entity167 have been asserting , black lives simply are n't treated as though they matter			0
i unequivocally and unconditionally support the right to free speech			1
unfettered free speech is essential to any democratic and pluralistic society			1
so i support the right of @entity1 to print the most outlandish , offensive cartoons it can come up with			0
and , to give another example , i support the free speech rights of @entity39 comedian @entity179 — even though i personally find his anti-semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the @entity1 cartoons i 've seen			1
still , i do n't think @entity182 should be facing prosecution by the @entity39 government for his speech , as he has apparently 38 times			2
curiously , i do n't see those rallying supposedly in support of free speech protesting @entity182 's repeated prosecution			1
at the same time , many of those supposedly proclaiming support for free speech are shaming and smearing media outlets that choose not to reprint the @entity1 drawings			1
the fascist right - wing and fundamentalist @entity35 want the same thing : to convince @entity35 and " the @entity37 " that there is an inherent divide between the two			1
the question for the rest of us — the ones who have free speech — is whether we feed the apocalyptic narrative or fight it			1
a few fanatical @entity35 have horrifically and unimaginably offended the world			2
that 's no excuse for anyone to go on offending all @entity35			0
to do so only helps advance the terrorists ' goal .			0

@entity216 : when violence used to silence free speech , some argue to ramp up cartoons
she says media does n't urge this over @entity97 violence , thus feeding jihadist view : @entity35 *vs.* @entity37
@entity216 : those of us with free speech should n't use it to help justify @entity35 ' apocalyptic narrative
