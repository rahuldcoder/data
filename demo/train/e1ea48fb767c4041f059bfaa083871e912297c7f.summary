@entity0 -- @entity3 attorney general @entity2 on monday announced a @entity5 program to try to thwart recruitment by extremist groups such as @entity8 , attempting to involve social and mental health workers as well as religious leaders and police to spot radicalization early			1
this effort is an outgrowth of existing community outreach programs that in recent years have linked @entity5 prosecutors , the @entity17 and the @entity18 with imams and local organizations hoping to prevent young people from joining terror groups			1
despite those efforts , authorities say more than 100 @entity3 have traveled in recent years to join groups involved in the @entity27 civil war			2
more than a dozen are believed to have joined @entity8 , which calls itself the @entity29			1
what 's the world going to do about @entity8 ? the @entity17 and other agencies are grappling with trying to track those who not only support radical groups online but also help recruit and try to travel to join the fight			0
the @entity37 administration says the new program will reach out to social services and mental health workers to help spread what is known about extremist groups ' recruitment methods			1
the idea is not only to counteract recruitment but also to encourage local community intervention efforts before law enforcement has to pursue possible prosecution			0
" we have established processes for detecting @entity3 extremists who attempt to join terror groups abroad , " @entity2 said in a video message posted on the @entity5 's website			1
" and we have engaged in extensive outreach to communities here in the @entity3 -- so we can work with them to identify threats before they emerge , to disrupt homegrown terrorists and to apprehend would - be violent extremists			0
but we can -- and we must -- do even more			0
" a @entity3 official said one of the first such places expected to be part of the new program is @entity65 , where in recent years young people have been recruited to join the @entity68 group @entity67 in @entity69 , and more recently @entity27 @entity68 rebel groups			2
the @entity5 has worked with local religious and community groups to help provide support when those communities face discrimination while using those contacts to find out when there are concerns about radicalization			2
however , in recent years , some imams and family members have complained about the heavy law enforcement response when they contact officials to express concern about specific members of their community			0
the @entity3 efforts are similar to those done in the @entity88 and other countries , which have sought to remove counter-radicalization efforts away from the focus of law enforcement .			0

@entity5 effort will try to involve community to spot radicalization early on
program will reach out to social services and mental health workers
more than a dozen @entity3 are believed to have joined @entity8
