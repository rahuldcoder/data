-- it 's not easy being a parent at the best of times - let alone when you 're the father of a brooding kryptonian			0
but @entity5 steps up to the challenge in the latest incarnation of @entity8 , fathering the " @entity9 " played by @entity11 @entity10			1
and if some viewers happen to notice a particularly convincing on - screen tenderness between the two actors , it could well be because of chance encounter over a decade ago			0
it was in 2000 while filming the hostage thriller @entity18 at the @entity20 in @entity21 that @entity5 , a lifelong rugby fan , spotted a young talent on the school pitch			1
" there was a rugby match being played in the background and there was one kid on that field who was quite dominant and fluid and so he caught my eye			0
and in between shots that kid came over and talked to me but all his questions were about acting			0
" watch : @entity5 and @entity10 at the @entity38 premiere of @entity9 the 16 year - old in shorts was none other than @entity10 , who until then had only played parts in school productions			1
@entity10 remembers , " i walked up to him , stuck my hand out and said ' hi my name 's @entity10 , i am considering becoming an actor , any tips ? what 's it like ? " and he said " well you know the pay is great but sometimes they do n't treat you so good - and i 'm paraphrasing ! " this brief meeting left a lasting impression with the @entity58 star , even once he had returned home to the other side of the world			2
" i figured the greatest thing you could get when you 're in boarding school or something is unexpected mail " explains @entity5 , who sent a box over to the young fan a couple of days later			1
" i received an @entity70 rugby jersey , " @entity10 remembers , " some @entity70 sweets , some @entity72 , a band cd and a picture of him in @entity58 saying ' @entity10 , a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step			2
" caped crusaders on patrol - meet the real life superheroes nobody could have predicted that the journey would lead to the $ 250 million @entity8 reboot @entity9 , least of all @entity5 , who struggled to recognise his co-star : " twelve years later i 'm in a gym in @entity85 , @entity86 and i 'm working out with my son in this movie that i 'm doing , he 's on the other side of the gym and i knew i knew him from somewhere , i just did n't know - i could n't place him			1
" @entity5 notes that after a workout he asked @entity10 " do i know you ? " @entity10 smiled and after and after several months was still reluctant to reveal all			1

" but , @entity5 did remember : " he said ' do you remember a kid that came and talked to you ? ' i went yeah , he goes and he talked to you about acting ? ' i said yes i do remember that , what did i say ? and he said ' well they pay you pretty well but they treat you like s * * * and i said yes @entity107 did say that , good to see you ! so it 's an amazing little karmic circle			2
" " we had a good laugh about it " recalls @entity10			0
" it 's one of those moments in life where you think what are the chances ? "			0

@entity5 and @entity10 's paths first **crossed** when @entity5 was filming scenes for @entity18 at @entity10 's boarding school .
@entity10 , who had been in school productions , *sought* acting *advice* and questioned @entity5 . @entity5 remembered the schoolboy and sent him a parcel , which *included* *signed* photograph .
years later their paths **crossed** again in a gym , and then eventually as co-stars in the latest @entity8 film .
