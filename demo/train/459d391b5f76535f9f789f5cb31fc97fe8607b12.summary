vice president @entity0 is known for his off - the - cuff remarks , and sometimes , they get him into trouble			1
the latest example came last week when @entity0 told an audience at @entity6 that @entity7 had been inadvertently strengthened by @entity8 and the @entity9 -- two @entity11 allies			1
because the two countries had supplied @entity14 rebels with money and weapons , @entity0 said they had essentially funded extremist elements in the region			1
his comments drew sharp pushback from leaders of those countries , and @entity0 apologized days later			1
here are five other moments when @entity0 spoke his mind , only to have it come back to bite him			1
same - sex marriage : @entity0 apologized to president @entity27 in may 2012 after he put the president in a tough position by coming out in support of same - sex marriage ahead of his boss			1
in an appearance on @entity35 's " @entity34 , " @entity0 said he was " absolutely comfortable " with same - sex marriage			1
the problem was that @entity27 was still " evolving " on his stance at the time			0
but days after @entity0 's remarks , @entity27 announced his own support for same - sex marriage			1
he said on @entity43 's " @entity42 " that @entity0 " probably got out a little bit over his skis , but out of generosity of spirit			1
" @entity27 added that he would have " preferred to have done this in my own way , on my own terms , " but " all 's well that ends well			2
@entity52 : @entity0 's most colorful slip - up was his use of the catchphrase " big f * * * ing deal			1
" that 's how he described the passage and signing of @entity27 's signature health care reform law in 2010			2
@entity0 had tried to keep his comment quiet -- he whispered it to @entity27 at the signing ceremony -- but a host of cameras and microphones in the room were able to pick it up			1
and with an emerging social media environment that 's especially friendly to ever - shorter quotes , the acronym " @entity52 " became even more popular			1
@entity72 : as anyone who 's traveled through @entity76 's @entity75 can attest , the transit hub is in dire need of upkeep			0
@entity0 famously compared it to a " @entity80 " this year			1
" if i blindfolded someone and took them at 2 o'clock in the morning into the airport in @entity85 and said ' where do you think you are ? ' they would say , ' this must be @entity11			0
this is a modern airport , ' " @entity0 said			1
" if i took them blindfolded and took them to @entity75 in @entity76 , he would , like , ' i must be in some @entity80 country			0
' i 'm not joking			0
" @entity76 mayor @entity94 called the analogy " inappropriate " and said the vice president 's comments were " not his finest moment			0
new catchphrase ? " is n't that a b --- - " : while he was offending the @entity8 and other allies in the fight against @entity7 , @entity0 gave perhaps a @entity104 slip on his view about being no. 2 in the @entity27 administration			1
during a q&a segment , a questioner introduced himself as the vice president of the student body			0
" is n't that a b * * * * ? " a smiling @entity0 said			1
" i mean ... excuse me			0
" @entity0 quickly followed up : " i 'm joking , i 'm joking , i 'm joking			2
best decision i ever made			0
i 'm joking -- that was a joke			0
" the student told @entity0 that he hopes he loves being vice president			2
" i do , actually			0
i love the guy i work with , " @entity0 said			2
@entity27 will be tested : just weeks before the 2008 presidential election , @entity0 predicted that @entity27 would have a bumpy start to his presidency -- not exactly the message that @entity27 , who was criticized for his lack of experience , wanted to convey			2
it will not be six months before the world tests @entity27 like they did @entity132 , " @entity0 told @entity128 fundraisers			2
" the world is looking			0
we 're about to elect a brilliant 47 - year - old senator @entity135			0
" " remember i said it standing here , if you do n't remember anything else i said , " @entity0 continued			2
" watch , we 're going to have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy			0
" we 'll let you be the judge on these : was he telling the truth , or at least what he thinks is the truth ? # awkward : @entity151 might have been a better pick : not long after @entity27 chose @entity0 as his running mate and the bruising battle between @entity27 and @entity151 for the @entity128 nomination , @entity0 sought to prop up @entity156 but may have taken it a step too far			2
" make no mistake about this , @entity151 is as qualified or more qualified than i am to be vice president of the @entity11			0
let 's get that straight , " he said at a @entity163 town hall when a voter told @entity0 he was glad the then - @entity166 senator had been chosen and not @entity156			1
" she 's a truly close personal friend , and she is qualified to be @entity135			0
she 's easily qualified to be vice president of the @entity11 , and quite frankly , it might have been a better pick than me , " he continued			0
@entity27 went on to pick @entity156 as his secretary of state , and she served during his first four years as president			0
@entity156 and @entity0 are now considering 2016 presidential reruns , but it 's highly doubtful @entity0 will repeat that remark			1
but then again , you never know			0
white boy can jump : at an event this year honoring @entity178 month , @entity0 said he and former @entity181 star @entity180 , now @entity183 's mayor , could take on the president in a game of hoops			1
" i told the president , next game i have him , " @entity0 said			2
" just remember i may be a white boy , but i can jump			0
" he probably regrets this one : in a june 2006 appearance in @entity163 , @entity0 talked with an @entity191 about his positive relationships with the @entity194 - @entity11 community in @entity166			1
with his @entity196 smile , he added a well - intentioned but cringe - worthy assessment of the group 's growing population in @entity166			1
" you can not go into a @entity202 or a @entity201 unless you have a slight @entity194 accent			0
oh , i 'm not joking			0

@entity0 apologized this weekend for yet another verbal slip - up
he 's made several well - intentioned though oddly timed or *inarticulate* gaffes
