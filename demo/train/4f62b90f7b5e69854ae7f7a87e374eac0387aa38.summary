@entity0 combines painting , photography and patience to manipulate viewers ' perceptions and create visual riddles by meticulously covering her subjects , and their environments , in thick strokes of paint until they resemble actual paintings			1
the idea came to her following a stint in politics after college , and deciding to channel the fakery and duplicity common to the political realm into something creative			2
" i really got to view the political spin machine up close , " @entity21 says			1
" everything before it reaches you has in some way been processed and repackaged to present a story that is fitting to somebody else 's agenda			2
and i kind of saw this idea of taking shadows and painting them on top of themselves , taking people and painting them on top of themselves , as repackaging the same base information and turning it into something that appears completely new on the surface			1
but deep down is the same person ; it 's the same message , but with my veneer of reinterpretation on top of it			2

the striking result is like someone wearing a costume of themselves			0
she 's played with several variations on the theme , blending her subjects into street art , bathtubs full of milk , interactive installations , even photographing one 's travels on the @entity71 subway system after being painted			2
it 's an effective optical illusion that often creates great results , but @entity21 -- who is n't a trained painter -- is motivated less by representing life than by getting people to question what they 're seeing			1
" there are a lot of things in this world that we take as a complete given , " she says , " but we do n't necessarily stop to take that step to think , ' ok , well what is actually underlying all of this ? ' " this is n't an entirely new concept			0
@entity89 painted her subjects in a similar fashion in the middle of the last decade , albeit in a flatter style and with a reduced color palette			0
something about @entity21 's approach resonated with viewers , though , and her experiments went viral			1

she 's more likely to invoke @entity107 or @entity108 than @entity109 or @entity110 when discussing her work			0
@entity21 found her artistic path shortly after earning her degree in political science and working on @entity116 's 2008 campaign			1
she quickly found herself intrigued by shadows and what they represent			0
painting over the shadows cast by people , objects , fences on blades of grass , eventually she was painting more than just the shadows and seeing an allegory in painting reality on itself			0
" i wanted to find a way to capture them and give this intangible absence of shape form and color â€” not all the shadows i paint are black			2
they 're all sorts of different colors			0
so that evolved into painting shadows onto people , and all of a sudden i was turning people into paintings without even realizing it			0
