-- from the sweeping coastlines of @entity4 to the sun - scorched island of @entity7 , @entity2 's olive groves have been thriving in the @entity9 heat for thousands of years			0
the tiny green fruits are harvested before autumn sets in , and cold pressed to deliver extra virgin olive oil , regarded as an elixir of life			0
the @entity15 believe this oil is the world 's best			1
but the world , @entity15 brothers @entity19 and @entity20 realized , did not			1
so , in 2007 , the @entity20 brothers developed a plan to take @entity15 produce to the global stage			1
it was an idea that would also , inadvertently , make the @entity20 brothers early examples of the country 's grass - roots survival strategy			1
the @entity29 , now aged 27 and 30 , grew up in coastal town of @entity31 , where their grandfather @entity19 owned a grocery store , selling everyday products such as olive oil or honey to locals			1
their father , @entity39 , was also in the food business , working for @entity41 's before setting up his own food distribution company			2
the brothers were raised on @entity15 delicacies , but as they grew older they realized the food they loved had a global image problem			1
take @entity15 olive oil 's reputation around the world			1
according to market research , shoppers preferred @entity53 and @entity54 oils , despite 80 % of @entity15 olive oil being extra virgin , compared to 45 % in @entity57			1
the @entity29 had found their mission			0
" the perception abroad is that @entity15 oil is the cheap one			1
bottom of the shelves , " @entity62 says			1
as a marketing graduate , he had a plan to change that image -- and a lot more			2
the brothers would find the best independent producers in the country and take their products global , with a guarantee of quality			2
@entity15 olive oil , honey and other delicacies were in their sights			1
the brothers chose the brand @entity80 -- the @entity15 word for project -- and set out to find the country 's best produce			1
in the tiny @entity86 region of @entity7 , they found the olive oil they wanted to promote			0
it came from olives whose history on the island dated back to the @entity95 occupation , 800 years ago			0
the caliber was so high the area had been granted special status from the @entity99			0
pressed in low temperatures and strictly by mechanical means , the region 's oil was among the purest in the world			0
it got the @entity80 approval			0
the brothers were also spending hours in labs testing @entity15 's best honey for purity and sugar content -- choosing a blend which they called " @entity114 's project " to finally launch @entity80			1
the brand was in the market			0
but it was headed straight into an economic storm			2
@entity80 launches , @entity2 stumbles as the @entity20 brothers developed their business plans , the country 's finances were beginning to unravel			1
@entity2 had hosted the @entity123 in 2004 which had left the country on a high -- but blown its budget			0
by 2008 , @entity2 was in recession			0
by 2010 , it had taken its first bailout from the @entity99 and @entity129 , and was forced to introduce austerity measures			2
it slashed through people 's pensions , incomes and jobs , and fed soaring unemployment			0
but by 2010 , @entity80 was an established brand , selling five lines of traditional products including spreads , canned fish , beans , mushrooms and wild truffles			0
the crisis , for the @entity29 , fed a " nothing to lose " attitude that ultimately boosted their success			2
as @entity2 recovers from its financial meltdown , other young entrepreneurs have emerged as flag - bearers for a new audacity and style			1
and many are doing so as expats , after being forced out of the country by the crisis			1
@entity15 diaspora lift those left behind in @entity161 , @entity2 is typical of this change			1
set up in 2012 to create a hub for @entity15 entrepreneurs , it promotes the idea expats can help their troubled homeland from afar			1
it reflects the exodus of @entity15 youth who went searching for better career prospects , and have since proved a surprising force for the country 's recovery			1
@entity174 's general manager , @entity173 , left @entity2 for an education in @entity176 and the @entity177 , working in start - ups and multinationals			0
like many of his compatriots , his @entity15 bloodlines run strong and he set up @entity174 , in his words , to " let people do whatever they do , and find ways to connect them to @entity2 and help @entity15 communities			1
" @entity62 is one of @entity174 's supporters			1
he has assisted with events and mentored potential " reloaders " about his own experiences of doing business with small - scale @entity15 operators			1
" @entity2 used to be a country with lots of entertainment , tourist sector , big summers ... now it is much more stressed environment , " @entity20 says			1
" this generates more passion to perform			0
" @entity201 is another example of the @entity15 renaissance			1
he started his multimedia marketing company @entity205 as a part - time , one - man operation during compulsory @entity15 army service in 2000			1
working for clients based around the world , @entity209 had a network of customers by the time he finished his service , and started working full - time			2
since then , it has become an international agency with offices on two continents and high - profile clients including @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222			0
@entity201 is now based in @entity223 , after following his @entity177 wife @entity225 to the @entity177 he runs the agency from @entity227 , although most of his 60 employees in the @entity15 city of @entity230 , where he is originally from			2
" truthfully , if i did n't have @entity2 , i would n't be in business , " @entity209 says			2
and it 's not cost which keeps him tapping his homeland			0
" there are many places around the world with talented workforce that would be more cost - effective			0
" the number one advantage is the loyalty			0
my most loyal talent is in @entity2			0
i have people there who have been working for me for many years			0
" he hopes to hire as many young @entity15 as possible			2
" @entity2 can be successful if you find people who can inspire and lead the change , " @entity209 says			2
' winners in a crisis ' the @entity29 are of this ilk			2
@entity80 , born as @entity2 's economy collapsed , now has a network of 150 producers who support seven stores and delis in @entity2 , one in @entity161 and another being prepped for @entity258			0
the brothers ' ambitions reach beyond @entity261 -- by 2017 , they want to be in the @entity177 , where demand for fresh @entity15 products has grown rapidly since @entity177 discovered , and fell in love with , the country 's traditional thick yoghurt			1
according to @entity62 , looking back at @entity80 's beginnings , " we started in a very , very bad situation and proved that we can be winners in crisis			1
" @entity20 recalls trying to convince the producers to join @entity80 when it was in its infancy			2
" @entity2 was wealthy back then , so we had to convince them that these two young brothers from @entity31 can do that job , that we can help them sell their products , " he says			2
back then , many producers did n't have barcodes or an @entity279 language list of their ingredients			0
now , thanks to @entity80 and despite the country 's devastating crisis , their products are being enjoyed at a trendy restaurant just off @entity285 , the main shopping hub in the heart of @entity161			0
there , in @entity80 's flagship @entity161 restaurant , @entity2 's traditional salad is created out of coarsely cut tomatoes , chunks of colorful peppers , a samphire garnish and feta cheese cream			0
but the key ingredient is the basil - infused olive oil that pulls the disparate flavors together			0
it is the oil made by small - scale farmers , under the sun of the @entity86 region , in @entity7			0
