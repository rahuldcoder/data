-- @entity5 is embarking on a major initiative in its war on terror and plans to build four new branches for the country 's elite counterterrorism units next year , a spokesman for the country 's @entity3 embassy said on saturday			1
@entity13 said the branches will be located in four different locations -- @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
@entity19 , @entity13 said , will have the largest contingent of counterterror units			0
" this is the next phase in the war on terrorism - we are bringing the fight to @entity27			1
" @entity5 has been locked in a struggle with @entity29 , or @entity29 , the offshoot of the @entity27 terror network based in @entity5			1
it grabbed the attention of the west with the attempted bombing of a @entity39 trans - @entity37 flight as it landed in @entity40 , @entity41 , on christmas day in 2009			0
the anti-terror campaign has also come under increased international scrutiny since authorities in late october uncovered a cargo plane bomb plot targeting @entity47 interests			0
@entity29 claimed responsibility for the scheme , which involved shipping explosives disguised as printer toner cartridges on @entity3 - bound cargo planes			1
according to a @entity5 government official , international partners such as the @entity3 , the @entity54 and @entity56 member countries like @entity57 will assist in training and equipping the @entity5 forces in the new branches			1
the official , who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media on the matter , told @entity0 , " one of the main reasons this is happening -- and one of the main ideas behind building these branches and training these forces -- is because air strikes have caused a lot of collateral damage			2
" " this will , hopefully , minimize collateral damage in the future , " he said			0
the four new counterterrorism branches " have been in the works for a while now , " said the official			2
" this year , the plans were pushed forward , " he said			0
" the branches should be built in 2011			2
" @entity5 's government , which has little control over many parts of its territory , has openly asked for @entity3 assistance to target militants -- though some officials have criticized their counterparts in @entity89 for not acting quickly or effectively enough			1
in an interview with @entity0 in november , @entity5 's foreign minister @entity90 said , " it was n't really until last year that the @entity3 have been heavily involved in building our counterterrorism capability and providing us with equipment			1
" over the past year , @entity95 have expanded the type of training they are giving to @entity5 's military , while also adding more special operations forces to the training mission there			2
earlier this year , defense secretary @entity102 approved spending $ 150 million to train and equip @entity5 's security forces , specifically so they can fight @entity27			2
that includes helicopters , planes and other equipment and it more than doubles the amount of aid the @entity3 military authorized in 2009			0
according to the @entity5 government official , @entity113 will get another four @entity116 helicopters in 2011 -- all of which should be operational by year 's end			1
a senior defense official told @entity0 last month that the @entity3 and @entity5 have shared surveillance and intelligence on @entity29 activity inside the country			1
last week , at a forum at the @entity126 , @entity127 , assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , said @entity29 is " increasingly active " in reaching out to find terrorist recruits , even in the @entity3			0
" @entity29 is now the most operationally active node of the @entity27 network , " @entity127 said			0
according to a statement released by the while @entity136 , @entity127 called @entity5 president @entity137 on thursday and emphasized " the importance of taking forceful action against @entity29 in order to thwart its plans to carry out terrorist attacks in @entity5 as well as in other countries , including in the @entity144			0
" earlier this month , a vehicle carrying @entity3 @entity147 personnel in @entity5 was attacked but nobody was injured			1
in october the motorcade of the @entity54 deputy ambassador was attacked and in april the @entity54 ambassador 's car was the target of a failed bomb attack			0
while it is not yet known who is responsible for that attack , the @entity156 's most recent travel advisory for @entity5 warns @entity3 of threats to @entity3 interests due to active terrorist activity , specifically from @entity29			1
embassy employees in @entity113 are instructed to use caution when visiting restaurants , hotels or tourist areas in the capital and are forbidden from traveling outside the capital .			0
