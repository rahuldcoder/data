@entity0 -- sen. @entity3 's campaign said late wednesday the @entity5 @entity4 missed a classified hearing last winter on the threat from the terrorist group @entity8 to go to @entity9 to raise money for her re-election			1
@entity3 admitted earlier this week she did n't attend a hearing because she went to the fundraiser but did n't disclose which hearing she missed			1
her decision to skip the @entity17 session -- at which high - level administration intelligence officials filled in senators on top secret details about the group -- is drawing fire from her @entity25 opponent , @entity5 house speaker @entity24 , who is narrowly trailing her in recent polls			1
the feb. 27 , 2014 classified @entity8 hearing she missed adds to a long list of @entity17 hearings @entity3 has already acknowledged skipping			1
her aides had previously explained she missed 27 of 49 public hearings over the last two years because of scheduling conflicts with other @entity34 business , such as hearings for different committees and meetings with @entity5 constituents			2
@entity24 is betting her absences from the national security hearings will hurt the first - term senator 's re-election effort in the @entity25 - leaning @entity44 state -- which has a very large military population -- even though he too has faced criticism for missing work in the state capital in order to attend his own fundraisers			1
" there is nothing more important than receiving briefings on our national security , " @entity24 told reporters on a conference call wednesday			1
" it 's the top responsibility of every @entity59			2
senator @entity60 has failed to do her job			1
what is her excuse for not showing up to work over half the time ? " @entity24 released an ad on thursday slamming @entity3 for missing hearings			1
charges that incumbents have missed hearings , briefings , votes , and other official work are popping up in a several closely - fought @entity34 races this year			1
the notion that lawmakers are not showing at the jobs they were elected to do infuriates many voters and feeds a narrative that @entity0 is broken and office holders need to be replaced			0
@entity81 campaign operatives in @entity0 , who are already battling headwinds in their effort to keep the @entity34 in @entity81 control , conducted private polling on the question so they could fully understand its impact			0
the results showed the issue is very potent and could damage even seasoned candidates			0
@entity34 math seems impossible to some democrats in this year 's midterm campaigns , @entity25 challengers have accused @entity81 senators @entity96 of @entity97 and @entity98 of @entity99 of missing hearings related to the threat from the terrorist group @entity8			1
rep. @entity103 , the @entity81 candidate for @entity34 in @entity104 , faced a barrage of tv ads accusing him of not appearing at hearings on the @entity109 's recent health care scandal			2
" when our veterans needed him , @entity103 was @entity112 , " one tv ad this summer charged			0
in another tight race , @entity34 candidate @entity114 blasted @entity117 @entity116 for missing hearings of the agriculture and appropriations committees and suggested he was too busy with his leadership duties to deal with the needs of @entity122			0
the allegations that @entity3 missed so many @entity17 hearings first came to light last month			2
but at a news conference tuesday night , following a debate with @entity24 , @entity3 was asked directly , " did you miss any of these meetings specifically for a fundraiser ? " " you know , there was one , " she responded			1
" and what had happened at that hearing , it was scheduled early in the day			0
and then votes were scheduled , and that hearing then had to be postponed later that day			0
so , yes , i did miss that one			0
" the fact that she skipped such an important hearing , at which the director of national intelligence @entity141 and the @entity143 took questions from senators on " current and future worldwide threats to the national security of the @entity148 , " according to the committee website , could prove politically difficult for voters to understand			0
on his conference call , @entity24 was asked about why he missed work in the @entity154 to raise campaign cash			2
he deflected the question but said , " quite honestly , if i had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of @entity8 , i would have canceled anything i was doing			0
" @entity162 ad : @entity24 in @entity165 brothers ' pocket whether voters will accept @entity3 's and @entity24 's explanations remains to be seen			1
but one of the dirty little truths about the way @entity0 works is that lawmakers from both parties have very busy schedules and do n't attend all the hearings of the committees and subcommittees to which they are assigned			0
even veteran senators from safe states will bristle at the suggestion they might have skipped a national security hearing or classified briefing to attend something that could be perceived as political in nature			0
that 's because they 've learned that voters do n't take it lightly .			2

sen. @entity3 's admission might hurt her chances at re-election
