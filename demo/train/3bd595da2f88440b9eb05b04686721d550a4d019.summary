@entity0 -- the @entity2 released more than 100 pages of e-mails on wednesday in a bid to quell critics who say president @entity7 and his aides played politics with national security following the deadly terror attack on the @entity13 diplomatic compound in @entity14 , @entity15			1
the e-mails detail the complex back and forth between the @entity17 , @entity18 , and the @entity2 in developing unclassified talking points that were used to underpin a controversial and slow - to - evolve explanation of events last september 11			1
the talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long - running battle between the @entity7 administration and @entity26 , who accuse it of not bolstering security prior to the attack , of botching the response to it , and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the november election			1
the @entity26 suggests that the administration removed specific terror references and stuck to an explanation -- later proved untrue -- that the attack was result of a spontaneous demonstration over an @entity41 film that was produced in the @entity13			1
there had been such a demonstration in @entity44			0
the @entity14 attack killed ambassador @entity46 and three other @entity13			0
read the e-mails in a searchable format			2
the @entity2 and its allies in @entity50 have made the case that any confusion and conflicting information in the early hours and days after the attacks stemmed from the " fog of war " -- not any deliberate effort to mislead the @entity13 people about the source of the attacks			1
@entity7 has called @entity26 concentration on the talking points a political " side show			1
" senior @entity7 administration officials contend the e-mails demonstrate the process of developing talking points for members of @entity50 to use in media interviews was not focused on politics but rather on events			1
analysis : @entity17 role in @entity14 underreported for instance , some of the e-mails expressed caution about what should be said publicly during an @entity79 investigation while others centered on the strength of intelligence at the time			2
the @entity2 said the e-mails it provided to inquiring lawmakers months ago and released on wednesday aim to paint a fuller picture following what it described as a series of selective and inaccurate e-mails recently appearing in media reports			1
" collectively , these e-mails make clear that the interagency process , including the @entity2 's interactions , were focused on providing the facts as we knew them based on the best information available at the time and protecting an ongoing investigation , " said @entity2 spokesman @entity90			2
the e-mails indicate the @entity17 was likely the lead organization in developing the talking points with the @entity18 recommending significant changes			1
opinion : @entity26 using @entity14 to smear changes made to talking points following the original drafting of them , @entity17 analysts made a handful of significant changes , according to administration sources			1
in the @entity17 's original set , the first bullet point included a reference that the @entity14 attack was " spontaneously inspired by the protests at the @entity113 in @entity44 and evolved into a direct assault against the @entity13 consulate and subsequently its annex			0
" it noted assessments could change " as additional information is collected and analyzed			0
" the second bullet point noted the attackers in @entity14 were comprised of " a mix of individuals from across many sections of @entity15 society			0
" it specified that intelligence officials did not know whether @entity129 extremists , including those aligned with @entity131 , had participated in the attack			2
@entity133 wants an open @entity14 hearing this bullet was later changed after a @entity17 analyst questioned whether the current intelligence supported the assertion that extremists had participated in the attack			0
another @entity17 officer agreed , stating intelligence placed extremists at a protest but could not support the notion that extremists were responsible for the @entity13 deaths			0
the editing team revised it so that talking point read , " the crowd almost certainly was a mix of individuals from across many sectors of @entity15 society			2
the investigation is on - going as to who is responsible			0
that being said , we do know that @entity129 extremists participated in the violent demonstrations			0
" the second @entity17 change was to the swap out the word " attacks " with " demonstrations " in the first bullet point , which an administration source said was to eliminate an awkward and illogical account of events			2
a third change the @entity17 made was to remove the name @entity131 from the second talking point , which was done because it did n't want to get ahead of the @entity79 's investigation of the attack			2
a key point of contention revolves around statements by @entity179 ambassador @entity178 , who took the most direct criticism because of her assertions in television interviews days after the attack that linked it to the demonstration			0
' shredded bodies ' in ' horrific ' @entity14 blast @entity18 concern a final @entity17 addition to the talking points was a warning about the security situation at the time of the armed assault			1
but that warning was eventually removed			0
senior administration officials say that long before the @entity17 heard concerns from the @entity18 about warnings being put in the talking points , @entity17 deputy director @entity199 advocated for removing the warnings out , since he felt the talking points should focus on what happened in @entity14 on september 11 , rather than the previous six months			1
he also felt it was unprofessional and unfair for the @entity17 to cite its own warnings to the @entity18 , officials said			2
@entity206 , then the @entity18 spokeswoman , had raised concerns over the @entity17 's first version , saying that they went further than what she was allowed to say about the attack during her briefings			0
she also questioned information about @entity17 warnings of extremist threats linked to @entity131 in @entity14 and eastern @entity15 , saying " the penultimate point could be abused by members ( of @entity50 ) to beat the @entity18 for not paying attention to agency warnings so why do we want to feed that either ? concerned ... " rep. @entity221 , the chairman of the @entity222 which is investigating the matter , told @entity1 's " @entity227 " that his staff wants to digest the e-mails			1
he stressed that they were a selected set of documents as released and the committee is still seeking a range of other information			1
