-- the pepper - spraying of student protesters at the @entity5 was an " objectively unreasonable " use of force by campus police , a state review of the incident concluded wednesday			1
scenes of @entity5 police lt. @entity10 spraying seated demonstrators with the irritant at near point - blank range went viral on the @entity15 and triggered widespread criticism of school authorities			1
a 190 - page report by a @entity5 task force concluded that the incident " should and could have been prevented			1
" the report spreads blame for the events that led to the confrontation across several members of the @entity5 leadership but said @entity10 was primarily responsible for the " objectively unreasonable decision " to pepper - spray the demonstrators			1
" on balance , the evidence does not provide an objective , factual basis for @entity31 's purported belief that he was trapped , that any of his officers were trapped , or that the safety of their arrestees was at issue , " the report states			1
" further , there is little evidence that any protesters attempted to use violence against the police			1
" but while criticizing @entity10 , the report also cites " systemic and repeated failures " among campus administrators it said " put officers in the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves			1
" @entity5 campus police chief @entity49 has been on administrative leave since november , along with @entity10 and another officer who has not been identified			1
neither @entity10 nor @entity49 agreed to be interviewed for the investigation , largely conducted by an outside risk - management firm , the report notes -- but @entity10 provided " a lengthy statement " to the firm			0
university administrators were worried that nonstudents from the @entity59 in the city of @entity61 and other @entity63 cities would take part in the on - campus encampment that student demonstrators had set up			0
but they failed to determine whether that was true or whether " other reasonable alternatives " should have been used to ensure security before sending in police to break up the encampment , the report found			2
the scope of the police operation was " ineffectively communicated , " the report found			0
@entity5 chancellor @entity76 apparently believed that no force would be used , while the police operations plan called the use of force " highly likely in this type of situation based on past events			2
" the report found the campus police command structure " very dysfunctional , " with @entity49 's lieutenants refusing to follow orders and getting into " heated exchanges " with the chief during the protests			0
@entity10 became an object of scorn after the protest			0
pranksters across the @entity15 inserted the image of the helmeted officer into famous paintings , photos and movie scenes , while the hacker 's collective @entity100 published his home and cell phone numbers online			0
attempts to contact him for comment were unsuccessful wednesday evening			0
the report accuses him not only of using unreasonable force , but of misusing his now - iconic weapon			0
the type of pepper - spray canister he carried was " not an authorized weapon " under campus police guidelines , and the officers " were not trained in how to use it correctly , " the report found			2
" and lt. @entity10 did not use it correctly , " the report notes			0
the model he carried " is a higher pressure type of pepper spray than what officers normally carry on their utility belts , " and is designed to be used at distances of six feet or more .			2

new : the report criticizes " systemic and repeated failures " by @entity5 leaders
it calls police use of pepper spray on demonstrators " objectively unreasonable "
the november incident drew widespread criticism of @entity5 authorities
there was " little evidence " that police faced violence from protesters , the report states
