his life in cricket was n't always without controversy , but no one could doubt his passion and commitment to the sport he loved			0
" @entity3 , who went to @entity4 as a teenager in the late 1960s , was heavily criticized for an " unsporting " run out of @entity80 batsman @entity79 in 1974 that saw the home fans storm the pitch in protest			1
@entity3 then revoked his appeal and @entity79 was reinstated			0
that ill feeling spilled over into the @entity89 team 's series in @entity4 in 1976 , before which @entity3 infamously said he would make the tourists " grovel			1

it sparked a transformation that made the tourists the dominant side in world cricket for the next two decades , as their bowlers battered @entity3 's team with a fearsome pace attack			2
@entity3 , having lost that series 3 - 0 , then redeemed himself as he led @entity4 to a first victory in @entity110 in 15 years -- but his time at the helm would prove to be shortlived			2
