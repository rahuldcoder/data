something 's going on in @entity3 , @entity4 , but nobody seems to know what it is			1

accompanying the sounds are vibrations that have shaken homes and household objects in the northeast corner of town , city manager @entity16 said			1
the sounds were loud enough monday morning that a @entity0 journalist could hear them during a cell phone conversation with @entity16			1
the baffling phenomenon does not appear to have caused any significant damage or injuries , according to @entity16			0
workers peered into manhole covers and utility crews tested for leaking natural gas and other problems , but no one has yet to find anything amiss , @entity16 said			0
geologists and the military do n't seem to have any quick answers , either , she said			2

" they 're also well enough known to be named by residents of @entity96 , the countries around the @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , among other places , he wrote			0
