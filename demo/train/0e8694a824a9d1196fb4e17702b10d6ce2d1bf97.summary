the @entity14 remained attached to its carrier aircraft for the duration of the 2 - hour , 54 - minute flight , reaching an altitude of 45,000 feet , according to a statement from @entity13			1
eventually , the 60 - foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the @entity34 by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space			0
the test - flight program is expected to continue through 2011 , going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin			1
