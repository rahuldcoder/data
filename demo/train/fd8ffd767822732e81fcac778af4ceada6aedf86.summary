the statement , carried by the state news agency @entity13 and attributed to a @entity15 source , followed a statement of concern for @entity1 's " national unity and territorial integrity " by @entity9 foreign minister @entity20 on tuesday			1
" we welcome what @entity20 affirmed about @entity9 's position towards @entity1 's unity and stability , and @entity1 reaffirms that it definitely rejects the interference in its internal affairs by any party , " the statement said			1

" battles between @entity1 government forces and rebels have raged intermittently for five years , and government troops launched a new offensive in late summer			2
