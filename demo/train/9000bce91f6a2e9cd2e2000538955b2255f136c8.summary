-- despite the recent recall of potentially contaminated @entity3 , lettuce lovers do n't have to nix key ingredients from their blts or face lifeless , leafless salads -- they just need to go to seed			1
food - borne illness has been tied to @entity8 found in commercially - grown lettuce sold to wholesalers , food service outlets and some in - store salad bars and delis			1
lettuce e. coli outbreak spreads to fourth state not only can at - home growers skip this risk -- they 'll also save money , enjoy a nearly endless variety of organic and heirloom options and have fresh salads at their fingertips all year around -- even without an outdoor garden			1
restaurants assure customers lettuce is safe amid recall supplies you need : seeds lettuce grows in several major formats : loose leaf ( like @entity35 and @entity36 ) , crisphead ( @entity38 and @entity39 ) , butterhead ( @entity40 and @entity41 ) , cos ( also called @entity3 ) and stem ( mostly used in @entity43 cooking )			1
for small container gardens and windowboxes , loose leaf is a solid bet , as it grows quickly and does n't need to establish deep roots			0
most hardware , garden and variety stores carry a range of popular seed varieties -- often for $ 1 or less -- but adventurous gardeners may wish to explore colorful , flavor - packed heirloom and certified organic single - seed packets and blends from online retailers			0
the @entity59 and @entity60 stock dozens , from blazing @entity61 to deep , dark @entity62			0
containers just about any will do , from store bought terracotta pots and plastic window boxes to take - out containers , foil pie pans , halved two - liter bottles and emptied - out plastic clamshells from the supermarket			2
the vessel just needs to be food - safe , several inches deep and perforated at the bottom to allow drainage			1
starting head lettuce in peat pots inside containers allows the option for transplant into a larger garden space -- or even sharing the bounty with friends			0
picture yourself : cool gardens soil if it 's going into the food , it 's going into you			0
if possible , opt for chemical - free or organic potting soil -- increasingly available at major hardware stores and home centers			1
lighting lightly shaded outdoor areas are ideal , as tender young leaves are susceptible to burning in bright sunlight , but windowboxes and kitchen counters can also produce surprisingly robust crops			0
if natural light is n't available , cool white bulbs and fluorescent lights can successfully stimulate vegetative growth			0
the seedlings need about 12 hours of light a day , and gardeners may need to adjust the distance from bulb to soil to figure out what works best in their home			2
you will also need a spray bottle and some plastic wrap			1
instructions : place at least 2 inches of moist , lightly - packed potting soil into a container with drainage holes			1
sprinkle a sparse layer of seeds on top of the soil and follow that with a very light dusting of soil			2
mist the soil with a few pumps from a water bottle , lightly cover the container with plastic wrap and place in a warm , bright spot			1
the seedlings should germinate in about five days			2
once they have , remove the plastic wrap and keep the container in the light for around 12 hours a day			2
keep the soil moist with the spray bottle or gentle watering from a can or cup			1
make sure the soil is draining and not pooling at the bottom of the container			0
most crops will be ready to harvest and enjoy within three to four weeks for leaf varieties , and longer for more robust heads			0
just snip leaves directly into a colander , rinse and enjoy the fruits -- and vegetables -- of your labor .			0
