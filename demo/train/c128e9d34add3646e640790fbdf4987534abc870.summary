-- last week , a federal judge issued a decision lifting the age and point - of - sale restrictions on emergency contraception , citing solid scientific and medical research showing that it is safe and effective in preventing unintended pregnancy			1
this is great news for all women because these restrictions created confusion and barriers , and when unprotected sex has occurred , time is a crucial factor			1
emergency contraception can prevent pregnancy for up to five days after intercourse , but the sooner it 's used the more effective it is			1
that 's why women 's health providers and activists lobbied to make emergency contraception available without a prescription â € ” to reduce delays			1
and because emergency contraception is safe , making it over-the - counter was a big step in creating better access to birth control			1
clearing up confusion about what emergency contraception is and how it works has been more challenging			2
it 's a fact that emergency contraception is birth control			1
the reality is , pregnancy does n't happen right after sex			0
it can take up to six days for the sperm and egg to meet after intercourse			0
that 's why it 's possible to prevent pregnancy even after the fact			1
emergency contraception postpones ovulation , which prevents sperm from coming in contact with and fertilizing an egg			1
pregnancy ca n't happen if there is no egg to join with sperm			0
in contrast , the so - called " abortion pill , " mifepristone , works by blocking the hormone progesterone , which is needed for a pregnancy to continue			0
so there 's a big difference between emergency contraception and nonsurgical abortion			1
there was much talk last week about the implications of lifting the age restrictions			0
some of it was motivated by safety concerns , which is a good and natural question to ask about any medication			0
it 's a fact that doctors have been prescribing emergency birth control since the 1960s , and there have been no reports of serious complications			0
more to the point , studies have repeatedly shown that emergency contraception is safe for use by women of all ages , including teens			1
another concern among some is that access to emergency contraception will increase the rates of unprotected sex , especially among teens			2
there is no evidence to support this			0
it 's a fact that rates of unprotected sex do not increase when there is more access to emergency contraception			2
research also indicates that teens understand how to use emergency contraception and that it is not intended for ongoing , regular use			2
the bottom line is that the use of reliable birth control is the best way to prevent an unintended pregnancy , but the fact is that unprotected sex does occur and sometimes birth control methods do fail			0
a condom could break , a woman could forget to take a pill , or nonconsensual sex could occur			0
that 's why when a woman fears she might become pregnant after her contraceptive has failed or she has had unprotected sex , she needs fast access to emergency contraception , not delays at the pharmacy counter			2
lifting these restrictions will allow emergency contraception to be stocked on store shelves , making it more accessible to everyone			2
it will provide a safe , effective way to prevent pregnancy and reduce the need for abortion that 's why last week 's ruling is so important â € ” it 's based on good science and good sense			1
and that 's a fact			0
