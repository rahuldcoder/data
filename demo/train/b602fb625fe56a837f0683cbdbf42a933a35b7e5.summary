-- pope @entity1 ignited a firestorm on the internet with a few words about gay and lesbian people that seemed to suggest a new church position on homosexuality			1
i say " seemed to " because it would only appear new to someone who was unfamiliar with the old position			0
speaking to a gang of reporters bringing up the rear of his plane on the way home from his quotific visit to @entity22 , the pope was asked about his recent reference to a " gay lobby " among the curial staff in @entity26			1
that phrase is already the source of some confusion			0
the pope responded that although a " gay lobby , " as in an inter-curial pressure group -- for or against more acceptance of gay @entity34 , who can say ? -- might be an issue , he did not have a problem with men and women who are homosexual			1
" if they accept the @entity40 and have good will , who am i to judge them ? they should n't be marginalized			0
the tendency ( to homosexuality ) is not the problem ... they 're our brothers			0
" what we learned about @entity1 in @entity50 speaking about homosexuality so frankly was remarkable in and of itself , but nothing the pope said deviated from current catholic catechism			1
although it regards homosexual acts as " intrinsically disordered , " church teaching demands that gay and lesbian people be accepted with " respect , compassion , and sensitivity			1
" " every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided , " reads the catechism			0
" these persons are called to fulfill @entity70 's will in their lives and , if they are @entity72 , to unite to the sacrifice of the @entity74 the difficulties they may encounter from their condition			0
" the catechism is a little more nuanced , and less unsightly , than the standard " hate the sin , love the sinner " platitude , but it does n't say much more and it 's far less than most lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender @entity34 would like to hear from their church			1
pope @entity1 was merely reiterating this teaching in his wonderfully straightforward , cut - through - the - gobbledygook manner			1
that 's not to say that his remarks do n't suggest a different emphasis in the church 's tone and pastoral approach to gay and lesbian @entity34 that will surely be welcome			1
@entity1 places the emphasis first on solidarity ( " they 're our brothers " ) and refers to the redemption and mercy all of us require and are capable of achieving			0
and as a practical ecclesiastical matter , his comments also argue that the " duty " to discourage the vocations of men with " deep - seated homosexual tendencies " may be en route to the " do n't ask , do n't tell " historical rag and bone shop			0
other groups of disaffected @entity34 can also take heart from the pope 's unfiltered comments on the plane			1
he suggested that his cardinal action squad of curial reformers will also be looking at the way the church has treated @entity34 who , for whatever reason , could not annul their marriages			2
divorced and remarried @entity34 have long been cut off from the sacramental and communal life of the church			2
@entity1 clearly wants to find a way to bring them home			0
opinion : what the pope left out about women women can also be hopeful that @entity1 hears their lamentations regarding how they have been cut off from leadership roles in the church			2
although he suggested that he had little inclination to return to the issue of women 's ordination , he said the church still has far to go in developing a real theology that explains the importance of women in the church			0
what that means practically speaking remains to be seen			0
let 's hope that what does not become lost as his comments on homosexuality are parsed , turned over and otherwise manhandled by the media in the coming days , is the pope 's keen attention during his @entity148 visit to issues of economic injustice and the importance of political and social dialogue			1
asked why he did not spend so much time on issues such as abortion and same - sex marriage while in @entity22 , he said the church 's teaching on such matters are already clear			2
this pope may be interested in moving at least rhetorically away from cultural stalemates and on to other issues that have also long been a preoccupation of the church : fighting poverty and human deprivation , creating political and economic opportunity , the just and sustainable stewardship of creation			2
in @entity22 he spoke frequently on social justice and alleviating poverty , asking all to give of their talents to respond to the world 's aching needs in a country where those needs and inequities are obvious			1
in @entity22 , @entity1 expressed his hope for a " culture of encounter , " as he described it			2
that 's an encounter across gay and straight lines , political and class lines , self - drawn lines between secularists and the faithful , borders between the haves and have - nots			0
as important as his off - the - cuff comments on the plane were -- and might turn out to be in the future -- his message of solidarity and his call to action on social injustice and economic inequality had a just claim to its share of the bandwidth on @entity202 this week			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity205 : pope @entity1 ' remarks about gays are n't a new position on homosexuality
@entity205 : his talking frankly was *startling* , but calling for compassion for gays is not new
@entity205 : the church may *change* its tone and approach to gay and lesbian @entity34 , however
but pope 's call in @entity22 for action on social injustice and poverty was equally important , he says
