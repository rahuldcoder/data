dr. @entity0 and dr. @entity1 were both infected with @entity2 while working in @entity3 with the aid organization @entity4			1
both were evacuated back to the @entity7 for care			2
but the two doctors also have another thing in common : they have the same blood type			0
that little fact could be life - saving for @entity13			2
@entity1 , who tested negative for the deadly virus after several weeks of treatment , recently flew to @entity17 where @entity13 is in isolation and donated his blood			1
doctors treated @entity0 with this plasma on at least two occasions			1
doctors believe @entity1 has antibodies that @entity0 lacks , but his immune system needs to help him fight the deadly virus			2
" they are so similar it did n't surprise me that they were the same blood type , " said his @entity13 's spouse , @entity26			1
@entity13 's doctors at the @entity30 in @entity31 said their patient is improving every day			1
" we were down to the last shot and it worked out great , " dr. @entity33 said at a press conference thursday about finding a blood match			2
" we were hoping to jump start his immunity			0
" at this point , doctors do n't feel like @entity13 will relapse , but they 've been cautious about predicting success			2
doctors in @entity43 told them there is typically a " honeymoon period " for patients after which they often get dramatically worse			2
@entity0 , however , has gotten better daily			1
dr. @entity47 said his condition has been moved up to " good " from " stable			0
" in addition to the blood transfusion , doctors are giving @entity13 aggressive supportive care to help his immune system fight the virus , including electrolytes and iv fluids			1
the @entity17 doctors have also given @entity13 an experimental drug that they will not name			1
he has received it every day , and his doctors say they believe it is helping			0
the @entity7 patients at @entity63 in @entity64 -- @entity1 and @entity65 -- were given an experimental drug called @entity67 , which was developed by the biotech firm @entity68 the drug had shown promise in small experiments with monkeys , but had not been given to humans until doctors tried it in the @entity63 patients			1
doctors there credit the drug with playing a role in their patients ' successful recoveries , but the company has said there are no more doses of the drug available			0
ebola treatment : does drug offer hope ? it 's possible @entity13 has received another experimental drug that 's in production called @entity2			1
@entity17 doctors think the current treatment has helped @entity0 's condition significantly			1
the first day , @entity33 said , was " pretty rocky			0
" @entity0 's spouse said he had to be sedated on the flight over			1
on the second day of treatment he was already showing signs of improvement , even with some " abnormalities in his organ systems			0
" on the third day @entity33 told his colleagues that he liked " the way this is going			0
" his doctors still want @entity0 to eat more			2
@entity26 said he is still weak			0
on wednesday the hospital put an exercise bike in his room that he rode for 10 minutes before tiring out			0
@entity0 used to ride 15 to 35 miles in one day , at least a few times a week			2
because doctors still know so little about how to defeat the ebola virus , @entity33 said @entity0 , as a physician , has been a particularly helpful patient			1
he has been able to give detailed reports about his symptoms			0
@entity26 said the @entity114 has told her that they are still trying to find out how her husband got sick in the first place			0
he was in @entity3 treating patients in an obstetrics clinic in @entity119 , not working directly with @entity2 patients			2
the @entity114 believe it happened during an emergency at the hospital , @entity0 said			0
so far , no one else at @entity13 's clinic has gotten sick			1
@entity0 has done missionary health work for the past 25 years			0
he had flown to @entity119 in august after learning his colleagues from @entity4 had gotten sick			0
@entity0 worried @entity2 would cause a " domino effect " on the already vulnerable @entity3 health care system and that people with common ailments would n't get help			1
when @entity0 arrived in @entity119 , that 's exactly what he found			1
his spouse said there was n't a single pair of latex gloves to buy in the entire city			0
without protective equipment , medical clinics shut down			0
she says @entity0 drove from hardware store to hardware store looking for boots to protect his staff			0
when he was finally able to open the clinic , for some it was too late			0
she says dozens of pregnant women who needed cesarean sections turned up at the clinic after having failed to find help anywhere else in the city			0
by the time these women arrived at @entity0 's clinic " only the mothers ' lives could be saved			1
" thankful for the support , but also a little embarrassed by the all the attention , @entity0 and his spouse asked that @entity7 remember people are struggling with @entity2 in @entity43 too			1
" he wants you to share his burden for the people of @entity3 and @entity43 , " @entity26 said			2
" every day and every week that we do n't do what we can to stop @entity2 in @entity43 , we are risking the possibility that it will not stay in @entity43			1

@entity7 @entity2 patient in @entity17 treated with other *survivor* 's blood
dr. @entity0 has also been given an *unnamed* experimental drug
@entity13 improves daily , hopes @entity7 continue to help people in @entity43
