@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is openly homosexual and is not afraid to speak about her sexual orientation publicly			1
but the 28 - year - old @entity1 woman says her family did n't feel the same way			1
five years ago , when she was 23 , she says , her family contacted a center that promised to cure @entity9 of her homosexuality			1
that , she says , is when her nightmare started			0
" on december 8 of 2006 , they stormed into my house , overpowered me , they put me inside a van and took me to a so - called ' therapeutic ' center			0
by the time i got there , i was already handcuffed and beat up , " @entity3 said			2
the clinic was called @entity21 , or @entity22			2
in december , @entity2 was granted limited access to the clinic			2
it looked like a mid-level tourist resort with buildings , houses and meeting rooms where patients were treated			0
the facility is located on the outskirts of @entity0 , @entity1 's capital			1
@entity3 says she endured all kinds of demeaning and abusive treatment during the 18 months she was held there			2
" i was kept in handcuffs for more than three months			0
i would be left without food for more than three or four days			0
they would handcuff me in a bathroom to a toilet bowl facing a toilet that was used by 60 people at the center , " @entity3 said			1
while we were there in december , one of the clinic 's directors by the name of @entity50 declined to speak specifically about @entity9 's allegations			1
but he did deny that their goal was to change the sexual orientation of their patients			1
their objective , @entity50 said , was " to modify all inadequate behaviors that are causing a particular individual to take inadequate attitudes			0
" government officials say this case is not isolated			2
in fact , they have found dozens of clinics that illegally offer treatments to " cure " homosexuality			1
some of these clinics operate as addiction treatment centers , but they offer homosexuality cures in a clandestine way			2
some are located in urban settings , officials say , but many others are set up in ranches or houses in remote areas and attract clients by word of mouth			0
after the first allegations were made , @entity22 was targeted for an investigation last year			0
but officials could get only enough evidence to cite the clinic on a technicality			2
" they say they found expired products			0
i would venture to say that the government has an ulterior motive , " @entity50 said			2
@entity92 , @entity1 's undersecretary of health , says expired products were indeed found in the women 's area of the clinic , so they closed that section			1
but that was only the beginning			0
" that was really not the most serious violation , " @entity92 said			0
" what concerns us is that we have reports about their methods to change a person 's sexual orientation and treatments that include torture and human rights violations			1
" since @entity2 visited @entity112 , the @entity1 government says , two raids were conducted at the clinic			1
more than 40 people were freed and the clinic was finally shut down for alleged human rights violations			1
@entity92 says people being held there were reluctant to speak at first , apparently afraid of being punished by clinic personnel if they spoke about the treatment center in a negative way			2
but then , one by one , patients started telling investigators horror stories			0
their testimonies , @entity92 says , mirror @entity3 's story			1
after the clinic was shut down , @entity2 's efforts to reach its director , @entity50 , for a comment have been unsuccessful			1
meanwhile , @entity9 has become a spokeswoman for the movement against clinics that claim to cure homosexuality and is working with organizations that aim to raise awareness on this issue			1
one such organization is @entity140 , a gay rights group in @entity0			0
@entity141 , the organization 's director , says that thanks in part to their efforts on this issue , the government has investigated and shut down 30 such clinics since july			1
" these are all private clinics			0
they reflect our society 's biases and misconception about homosexuality			2
we still have a lot of homophobia and misogyny , " @entity141 said			0
" many people still consider lesbianism a disease and a psychiatric disorder			0
" a change in leadership at the @entity165 is also good news for gay rights organizations			0
@entity168 , a former executive director of @entity169 , a gay rights group , and a respected gay rights activist in @entity1 , was named health minister earlier this month			1
under her leadership , three raids have already taken place in the @entity0 area , and dozens of women have been rescued			0
@entity92 , the health undersecretary , says new regulations for addiction treatment centers were implemented last year			0
out of 302 centers they have investigated , 208 , or 69 percent , were found to be in violation of one or more of the new regulations			0
the government , @entity92 says , is aggressively investigating reports of clinics supposedly offering to cure homosexuality			1
as a matter of policy , the undersecretary says , @entity1 does not recognize it as a disease and therefore anybody offering to " cure " it is in violation of the law .			1

@entity3 says she was beaten at clinic trying to " cure " her homosexuality
the clinic director denies they try to change sexual orientation
the @entity1 government says other people 's stories support @entity9 's
more than 30 such clinics have been shut down since july , an activist says
