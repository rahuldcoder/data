@entity0 , @entity1 -- signing people up for health insurance is the easy part of @entity7 's job ministering to immigrants and @entity9 in this manufacturing hub along the @entity11			1
but many of those she 's enrolled are surprised and indignant when they go to the doctor and are asked to a pay a bill -- perhaps a copayment			0
they insist they 've already paid their monthly insurance premium			2
" they call us and say , ' it 's a scam ' , " says @entity7 , an insurance navigator for the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , a nonprofit agency that specializes in helping the largest @entity26 - @entity25 population in any @entity25 city			1
that 's just one example of the confusion immigrants face as they try to navigate the @entity25 health care system			1
even after signing up for insurance through the @entity38 , advocates find that explaining to clients that they will still have to pay out of their own pockets each time they go to the doctor or get lab tests requires more than translating words like " premium " and " deductible " for non-english speakers			1
" this whole concept of insurance does n't exist in the @entity52 world , " said @entity47 , public health manager for @entity23			1
" people are always confused about the health care system when they come to this country			1
" problems like this are arising all over the country where @entity59 , @entity60 and other immigrant populations face cultural as well as language barriers			2
non-citizens are three times more likely to be uninsured than @entity25 - born residents , according to the @entity66 on @entity67 and the @entity68			1
as many as 10 million non-citizens living legally in the @entity25 are expected to gain health insurance through the @entity38 , although it 's unclear how many have gained coverage so far			1
mandate covers legal immigrants many of these immigrants are getting insurance because the @entity38 requires them to do so , just as it does for @entity25 citizens , and because it may be affordable for the first time			1
like citizens , legal immigrants can use the law 's online exchanges to sign up for coverage and find out if they are eligible for government subsidies			1
they also face a tax penalty if they do n't sign up			2
immigrants who are not in the country legally , however , are barred from using the exchanges and are n't required to have coverage			2
@entity23 clients typically hail from places such as @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
besides training navigators and helping clients enroll , the center offers primary care services , cancer screenings and various public health awareness workshops in the community			1
some of them are not easy to convince that they should enroll in health coverage			2
" @entity95 do n't believe in insurance , " said @entity107 , a case manager at @entity23 and a refugee from @entity95 , who says people from his country are accustomed to government - sponsored health care			1
" they do n't know about it [ health insurance ] and they do n't want to know about it			1
" @entity47 said another challenge has been helping clients understand how access to doctors works in the @entity25			1
" in their country , the wait time depends on socioeconomic status ... the lower the status , the longer the wait time , " she said			0
@entity129 , 27 , who did n't wish to be identified by her full name , came to @entity0 as a refugee from @entity132 in february and developed a severe sore throat			0
she was shocked at the prices for the medication , let alone what it costs to see the doctor as someone without health insurance			1
" here i have to pay $ 70 to see a doctor , but in @entity95 i only have to pay $ 15 and do not have to wait as long , " she said			0
she could n't afford the doctor or the medication so she had to wait the illness out			0
she does not qualify for full @entity67 services because she has n't been in the country for five years , but @entity1 's medicaid program does give her access to some limited emergency services			0
cultural issues can be barrier to care but toughing it out is harder for people with chronic diseases , which are a big problem among @entity23 clients who suffer from diabetes , breast cancer , cardiovascular disease and , oftentimes among refugees , depression			2
cultural barriers also make it difficult to get some clients to come in for care			2
" we have ladies who have never had a mammogram , " @entity47 said			0
" @entity169 is stigmatized in the @entity26 culture			0
[ women ] were scared no one would marry their daughters if others found out they were diagnosed			0
" that 's because people worry the cancer is hereditary and can be passed down from mother to daughter			0
to persuade women to come in for mammograms , @entity47 said , access has an unmarked door that allows them to slip in and out of the testing area without being identified			0
@entity23 also distributes a special pamphlet for @entity26 @entity25 women , explaining the importance of mammograms and how to examine themselves			1
it also pairs women diagnosed with cancer with survivors who can help them navigate the system and give them support			2
public health workshops have also helped get others to come in regularly for testing and physicals			0
@entity23 also helps people with chronic illness navigate how to pay for their care			2
" as a diabetic i was walking on eggshells , " said @entity205 , 48 , as she talked about paying for the insulin she needed to manage her diabetes			0
she had had insurance , but after getting diagnosed with diabetes while she was pregnant with her third child in 2005 , her premium skyrocketed from $ 400 a month to almost $ 900 a month			0
she canceled the policy and started paying for doctors ' appointments out of pocket			0
she clipped manufacturer coupons and constantly asked her doctors for insulin samples to help her manage her ailment			0
but since signing up again under the health law , which prohibits charging higher premiums to those with health issues , @entity225 and her husband receive $ 430 in subsidies toward their monthly insurance premium , while her children qualify for @entity67 , the federal - state insurance program for the poor			1
the premium " is now $ 133 for both my husband and i through @entity233 , " @entity205 said			0
" it 's a blessing			0
" states work around @entity38 to help undocumented immigrants @entity2 is an editorially independent program of the @entity2 .			1
