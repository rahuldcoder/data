but when @entity17 photographer @entity16 set out to recreate the provocative sequence for his latest project , finding a bed of red roses proved difficult			1
undeterred , @entity16 found the solution by using a plant wall inside the hotel where the shoot was taking place			1
" the creative process of this series itself is very similar to the way @entity32 contemporary creation often takes place , " says @entity16			1
" we often have to tweak concepts and styles from around the world and adapt them to our context , while preserving their original feel			0
" that series is " @entity52 , " a dazzling collection of images in which @entity16 and @entity44 , a @entity17 - based @entity46 - @entity45 photographer , revisited several @entity48 classics to give an @entity32 take on some of cinema 's most iconic moments			1
the two artists merged their passion for aesthetics and performance art to offer a collection of striking images infused with flowing swirls of color , vivacious textures and dynamic characters			0
" i wanted to imagine what these movies would look like if they were conceived and shot in @entity32 , " explains @entity16			1
read this : artists ' road trip across @entity32 completely self - taught , the 33 - year - old is a newcomer to @entity17 's creative scene			1
he started experimenting with cameras on the streets of @entity72 in 2010 , at a time when he was still working in corporate communications for a multinational			0
but much to his surprise , @entity16 's first conceptual project , the futuristic " @entity79 , " was selected the following year to be showcased at @entity77 , @entity32 's premier photo exhibition			1
after that , @entity16 decided to fully pursue his passion for photography			2
he quit his job last year and quickly started building an eclectic body of work that spreads from conceptual art to fashion photography and portraits			1
@entity0 's @entity89 spoke to @entity16 about revisiting cinema classics and the transition from the corporate world to art. @entity0 : " @entity97 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity98 " are just some of the famous films featured in the @entity96 series			1
what was the inspiration behind the project ? @entity16 : i worked on this project with @entity46 - born @entity45 photographer @entity44 after an invitation by the @entity105			1
we thought that actually using cinema as a general theme would be a way for our respective creative universes to meet because cinema involves fashion and aesthetics , but it also involves an important performance dimension			1
we started working with the movies we liked , the movies that had influenced us			0
i remember watching in the 1980s the same movies as the young people of @entity120 and @entity121 and maybe @entity122			0
at the end of the day we 're all the same young people regardless of where you were born and where you were raised and somehow i wanted to show this also through the choice of movies in the series			0
@entity0 : is part of your artistic goal to show the modern side of @entity72 and @entity17 ? @entity135 : yes , and it 's not even about the new @entity32 , it 's just that because of globalization and the internet the modernity of @entity32 has sort of accelerated			1
but even back in the 1980s , when i was just a kid , i can tell you that @entity72 was very modernized and international			0
another advantage we had was that we were open to not only the western world but the entire world -- we had @entity32 cultural content , @entity147 content , @entity149 or @entity150 movies			1
it 's just a shame that all of this , especially the urban life of the 1980s , is not documented			0
read this : photos show @entity157 in new light so when i think about creating a new series i always make sure that not only the current @entity32 but also the one i grew up is somehow portrayed			2
i believe it 's the responsibility of a photographer to not only conceptualize but also come up with some work that can be used as a reference in the future as a history document			1
@entity0 : how is it working as an artist in @entity72 today ? @entity135 : it 's very exciting being part of the creative scene in @entity72 right now			2
i think the period we are living in is a breakthrough , in the sense that there is a sustained and growing interest for " another @entity32			2
" also , @entity32 artists are now aware that they can communicate to the world , and speak about and for themselves			2
it 's terrific when you realize that you can actually write your own history as you live your passion			0
@entity0 : what kind of themes fascinate you ? @entity135 : i am very interested in movement ; movement of the human body but also of the fabrics , outfits and styles that are used to embellish the body			0
even in my fashion photography i always make sure that there is a movement that is captured , and that tells a story			0
i 'm also interested in the aesthetics of the 1970s and the 1980s , especially in @entity32 , and i always try to recreate that with the use of colors and styling references			2
and i 'm also interested in personalities ; that 's why i 've started a series of portraits called " @entity206			2
" the reason behind it was that i wanted to somehow pay homage and also document the youngest generation of @entity72 's cultural entrepreneurs -- i 'm convinced that many of these people are going to be very successful and are going to bring a lot of great things to the cultural sector in the next few years			0
@entity0 : how was the transition from the corporate world to becoming artist ? @entity135 : i quit my job a year ago ; it was a quite bold decision that scared many people around me because being an artist was not considered as a valid option			0
i come from a family where my mum is a lawyer and my dad is a chartered accountant -- both of them having very senior jobs throughout their careers -- and i attended top schools that were very advanced and quite expensive			0
with the money my family invested in me , of course you can imagine my mum being quite devastated , but i now have their full support .			0
