-- " @entity9 " introduces a new generation of gamers to the mechanical mayhem of the smash - ' em - up series ' previous games , while actually adding in a little bit of a story to tie all the action together			1
the new game from creator @entity11 and @entity12 not only brings back some familiar and twisted characters , but it also reworks a demolition - derby style of combat that pits vehicle against vehicle with explosive results			1
the game sticks to the basic plot of the 1995 original -- winning a tournament to gain a granted wish			2
in single - player mode , gamers will play three of its classic characters -- @entity27 , mr. @entity28 and @entity29 -- in succession			1
vehicles for combat are chosen before each battle			1
players can usually select three for each scenario and change them out at a garage , theoretically ensuring them a nonbusted ride at all times			2
starting with @entity27 's iconic ice cream truck , the virtual garage includes a motorcycle , a helicopter , a semitruck and even an ambulance that vaguely resembles @entity46 - 1 from " @entity47			1
" selection is limited at first , but more vehicles are unlocked as missions are completed			2
each vehicle has its own specialized weapons -- kamikaze has a flame thrower , while @entity55 can fling chainsaws			0
more weapons and ammunition are scattered all over the playing field			0
there are also spots to restore health , so players can get a bit of a boost even if they ca n't make it back to their garages			1
cars can also be customized , if that is your thing , and any driver can use any car			0
the battle areas vary in size and scope			0
some smash - ups are played out in little towns with residents running for cover ( or , inevitably , getting run over )			1
many of the buildings are destructible and some are even large enough to drive into and engage opponents in combat			1
there is a battle - dome type area with multiple levels and hidden passageways			2
a new superopponent , @entity89 , not only takes you on himself , but also spawns other foes who drive out of the back of his massive tractor - trailer			1
since the object of each battle is to be the last one driving , taking out the @entity89 is something that needs to be done but does n't happen easily			0
the combat gets progressively harder as the game moves through the stories of the three main characters			1
boss battles are appropriately tough , but some fights are so difficult , you 'll want to snap your controller			0
( resist that temptation )			0
the story that acts as a backdrop for the behind - the - wheel chaos makes learning about combat fun			1
sure , it 's all about destroying your opponents			0
but having a reason to do it , rather than destruction for destruction 's sake , makes more sense			0
cinematics are smartly handled with both live actors and animationm , providing nice background into each character 's history and reason for wanting to win the tournament			1
the character @entity129 returns as the ringmaster for this violent contest and has the power to grant a single wish to the winner			0
but be careful what you wish for			0
multiplayer action pits faction against faction and really lets a player 's violent streak come through			0
teams are based on popular characters from the franchise -- the clowns , the dolls , @entity146 and @entity147 ( led by the preacher )			2
there are several game modes available to allow for split - screen action and online play			2
while most combat is of the last - man - standing variety , a new mode offers a bit of levity to the bloodshed			1
called the " nuke " mode , it also requires the most teamwork			0
players must kidnap an opposing team 's leader , take them back to their base and then sacrifice them to a missile launcher			2
the launcher then fires off a nuclear missile , which must be guided to strike a giant metal statue being held aloft by a helicopter			0
do this three times and you win the match			0
it is slapstick comedy with a morbid twist and is perfect for this franchise 's long - established play on humor with a sense of the macabre			2
" @entity9 " is a great outlet for mindless destruction and unintentional levity all wrapped up into neat little , blood - soaked boxes made of metal			1
it is n't meant to be deep , meaningful or even realistic , but it achieves what games should be all about -- it is fun			0
" @entity9 " is exclusive to the @entity194 , and available now in the @entity195 and on march 7 in @entity196			1
it is rated m for mature because of blood and gore , intense violence and strong language			0
this review was completed with an advance limited edition copy for the @entity194 .			1

@entity206 brings back familiar characters and a demolition - derby style of *vehicular* combat
its cinematics are smartly done , with both live actors and animation
" @entity9 " is exclusive to the @entity194 *console*
