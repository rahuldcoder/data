@entity0 -- as president @entity4 prepares to deliver one of the most important addresses of his presidency , the @entity3 public remains deeply skeptical and confused about his plan to strike @entity9 -- what it would accomplish , and whether it is even necessary now , given the @entity13 proposal to place @entity9 's chemical weapons stockpile under international control			1
with many @entity3 saying they are still unclear about what @entity4 wants to do , here are five questions the president must answer before he can begin to sway the court of public opinion in his favor			1
now that there may be a diplomatic alternative -- the @entity13 plan -- why does the @entity3 still need to attack ? this is the most important question of the day			1
in a major development , @entity9 has reportedly accepted the @entity13 proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile to international control , but the details of what was actually agreed to are still murky			1
the @entity32 is skeptical , cautioning that it could be a stalling tactic , but said it would take a hard look at the proposal			2
the @entity4 administration has agreed to work with @entity38 president @entity37 and @entity40 prime minister @entity39 , in consultation with @entity13 and @entity42 , to explore the viability of the @entity13 proposal			1
these efforts will begin tuesday at the @entity45 and will include a discussion on elements of a potential @entity49 resolution			0
a stunning turn that could silence @entity9 war drums @entity4 told @entity1 's @entity52 on monday that he still needs the threat of military action in order to force a negotiated settlement			1
if he can win support from @entity59 for an attack , that threat will be an even more effective tool			0
many members of @entity59 are pushing a nonmilitary route			0
sen. @entity64 , @entity65 , sent a letter to his constituents , citing other possible options : international coalitions , economic sanctions , war - crime tribunals			0
two senators are drafting a compromise resolution that would hold off on a military strike and give @entity9 president @entity75 the option to sign on to the @entity77 within the next 45 days			2
if he fails to do so , then a @entity3 retaliation would be warranted			0
the president previously failed to garner meaningful international consensus for a military strike			0
@entity13 and @entity42 blocked any action at the @entity49			0
and at the @entity86 meeting last week , the president did not come away with additional international support , although 14 nations signed on to a letter condemning @entity75 's tactics in the civil war			0
but with the @entity13 deal on the table , now even @entity94 has said it would support removing chemical weapons from @entity9			1
why should the @entity3 be worried about what @entity9 allegedly did ? is it worth going to war ? @entity4 must make a convincing case that the use of sarin gas in @entity9 was a moral abomination that the @entity3 and the international community simply can not tolerate , and that allowing it to go unpunished would leave an imminent and continued threat to @entity3 national security			1
but , simply put , @entity3 are sick of war			0
in a @entity1 / @entity109 poll released monday , six in 10 say the @entity111 war was a mistake and about half say the same thing about the war in @entity116			0
three - quarters say the @entity3 should n't play the role of world policeman			0
additionally , nearly seven in 10 say that it 's not in the @entity3 national interest to get involved in @entity9 's civil war			1
so the president must provide a really good reason to intervene in another messy conflict in the @entity126 , where politics are far more complex than the secular two - party system in the @entity3			2
even more , 72 % , say a @entity3 airstrike would not achieve significant @entity3 goals			0
@entity1 poll : part of @entity9 strike opposition is the messenger 's fault members of @entity59 have spoken about the same concern			2
sen. @entity138 , @entity139 , said on @entity1 's " @entity140 " last week that there is " no military intervention at this stage " that could lead to an outcome favorable to @entity3 's national security interests			2
as part of the president 's media blitz , national security adviser @entity146 said monday that @entity75 's use of chemical weapons " threatens the national security of the @entity3 " and @entity151			1
she said every time chemical weapons are used , it " raises the likelihood " that terrorists will obtain the chemical weapons , which she said puts @entity3 troops and diplomats overseas at risk and opens the door for use of other " weapons of mass destruction			1
" @entity4 will have to make a direct connection to national security and @entity3 interests			2
but after @entity111 , the bar to prove a national security threat to the @entity3 seems to be much higher			0
what would be the endgame ? @entity4 will have to explain to the @entity3 people the goal of military strikes			2
he has said his goal is not to take out @entity75 or institute regime change or even to aid the rebels , but to enforce an international treaty outlawing chemical weapons			2
deterring future use of chemical weapons and degrading @entity75 's chemical weapons stockpile are the reason for @entity3 military intervention , @entity179 argued			1
or , alternatively , @entity4 needs to show how critical congressional support -- and the support of the @entity3 people -- are to bringing @entity9 to the negotiating table to follow through on the @entity13 proposal			1
either way , the president will have to succinctly and clearly explain his argument to the @entity3 people			0
some question if " deter and degrade " would even work			0
furthermore , is it reason enough , when nearly three - quarters of @entity3 say a @entity3 airstrike would not achieve significant @entity3 goals ? @entity196 : how they 'll vote on @entity9 strike the administration promises limited military action			2
@entity179 has said the @entity3 is capable of a limited strike , pointing to previous military engagements that lasted just hours , including a bombing campaign against @entity111 in 1998			0
secretary of state @entity204 said monday that the campaign will be " unbelievably small			0
" the president will have to explain exactly what the endgame is and precisely what " limited " means			0
if the @entity3 attacks , what if @entity75 retaliates ? this is a major risk that concerns many members of @entity59			0
if the @entity3 military attack is extremely limited and @entity75 retaliates , what are the contingency plans ? sen. @entity216 , @entity217 , asked that critical question : " what if we execute this strike and then he decides to use chemical weapons again			1
do we strike again ? " she said it 's one of her biggest concerns			0
@entity227 has said he would respond			0
" you should expect everything , " he told @entity228 and @entity230 interviewer @entity229			0
the @entity3 people are going to want to hear contingency plans for what happens next if @entity3 strikes do n't cripple @entity75 's chemical weapons use			1
now that @entity9 has said it would comply with the @entity13 proposal , why does the president still need to address the nation ? @entity4 told @entity52 he is n't so convinced that @entity9 is telling the truth			1
the administration distrusts @entity9 and its ally , @entity13 , and worries that the proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile is simply a tactic to buy time and derail a potential @entity3 strike			1
while the administration indicated that it will look into @entity9 's offer , the president does n't want to get burned			1
so he will continue to press his case for a military strike			0
and if @entity9 's offer proves empty , the president wo n't have lost any time waiting on the sidelines			1
@entity9 's offer , however , has the potential to make @entity4 's sales job either easier -- or harder			1
if @entity9 is bluffing , the president can come back to the @entity3 people and make an even stronger argument for military action			2
but @entity75 has at least provided the illusion that the stubborn regime is open to an alternative , making @entity4 's task of persuading the public to favor a military strike a little more difficult			1
still , the feeling inside the @entity32 is that , given the @entity13 proposal , there may now be less urgency for a vote in @entity59			1
@entity32 officials tell @entity1 that their position has been strengthened since @entity9 embraced the proposal to turn over its stockpiles			2
however , if the @entity3 and the international community believe @entity9 will turn over the stockpiles , but then @entity75 drags his feet , fails to comply , or , worse yet , launches another attack , @entity4 could come back and say , " we tried the diplomatic approach , but it failed , " leaving the nation and the world no other alternative but to attack			1
@entity1 's @entity285 , @entity286 , @entity287 and @entity288 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 is *scheduled* to address the nation tuesday night from the @entity32
he will need to answer several *key* questions for the @entity3 public
poll : many think @entity4 has not done a good job explaining the need to attack @entity9
new @entity13 proposal on @entity9 's chemical weapons may alter @entity4 's message
