the @entity1 air force has a new secret weapon : monkeys			1
the @entity6 has trained macaques to keep its troops safe by discouraging birds from nesting near the air force base , the @entity5 's website reported earlier this week			1
the monkeys are used in an unidentified air force base in northern @entity1 , which is situated right on a major migratory route for birds			1
when swarms of birds fly around the base , it poses a threat to military planes that are in mid-flight			2
the birds could potentially get sucked into plane engines , endangering the lives of both birds and pilots			0
" do n't worry , we now have a secret weapon ! " @entity25 , a high - ranking officer , was quoted as saying on the @entity5 website			0
the officer was referring to the specially - trained monkeys that answer to the sound of a whistle			2
when the nests of birds are discovered in tree tops , the monkey army is deployed to remove them			1
the @entity5 have tried many different methods to remove the nests in the past , including opening fire on the nests , using long bamboo poles to topple them out of trees , and having soldiers climb the trees to pick them out			0
none of these methods were very effective			0
apart from being time - consuming and dangerous for the officers who had to climb the trees , the birds kept coming back			0
however , when monkeys remove the nests , the birds do not return , as the macaques leave a scent on the branches that discourage the birds , according to the @entity5 's web posting			1
" the monkeys are loyal bodyguards who defend the safety of our comrades , " said the web report .			0
