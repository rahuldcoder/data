-- the banjo , for years in the background , stepped out of the shadows in the steady hands of @entity5			1
beyond his many recordings and appearances , the bluegrass music legend , who died wednesday at 88 , left an instructional book considered a must - read for novice banjo players			1
" @entity5 and the @entity14 , " first published in 1968 , still lays the foundation for beginners , said @entity15 , founder of the website @entity17			1
by thursday afternoon , hundreds of the site 's 67,000 registered users had left tributes , listed @entity22 songs they played since learning he died and exchanged messages on his groundbreaking technique			1
the site attracts both grizzled veterans and beginners			0
" a lot of those guys played ( his ) records , slowing down the records so they figured out the notes @entity38 was playing , " said @entity15 , 32 , of @entity30 , @entity31			0
playing the banjo well takes dedication			0
" it 's a very physical instrument			0
when you are talking about bluegrass style , you have to dial in your technique precisely and practice real consistently , " said @entity15 , a web developer who calls running @entity17 a part - time hobby			1
for many of a certain age , @entity22 ' banjo was part of the soundtrack of an era on " @entity52 of @entity53 " -- the theme song from the @entity56 sitcom " @entity53 , " which aired on @entity56 from 1962 to 1971 and for decades afterward in syndication			1
he played with @entity58 's @entity58 , and later with @entity59 with the @entity60			2
the 1967 film " @entity62 " featured their 1949 instrumental " @entity63			0
" but much more than that , @entity22 popularized a three - finger picking style that brought the banjo to the fore in a supercharged genre			1
the late @entity69 , a noted banjo musician in his own right , was quoted in @entity73 ' " @entity72 's music : @entity78 , " as summing it up this way : " everybody 's all worried about who invented the style and it 's obvious that three - finger banjo pickers have been around a long time -- maybe since 1840			1
but my feeling about it is that if it was n't for @entity5 , you would n't be worried about who invented it			2
" in an article on the @entity90 's website , bluegrass historian @entity87 described @entity22 ' style as " a ' roll ' executed with the thumb and two fingers of his right hand " that essentially made the banjo " a lead instrument like a fiddle or a guitar , particularly on faster pieces and instrumentals			1
this novel sound attracted considerable attention to their @entity105 performances , road shows , and @entity108 recordings			0
" traditional bluegrass is " rapid fire , pretty loud , ( with ) explosive notes , " @entity15 told @entity0			1
but there is also a quieter side to the banjo			0
innovative musician @entity115 is known for his jazz style and sparing play			2
@entity17 's main draw is its many forums on the art of music and banjo - making			2
noted players @entity123 and @entity125 , who performs with @entity126 , are among those who post			0
" they ( members ) all want to be able to play the style of music they are looking for , " said @entity15			0
" some want to play @entity5 - style bluegrass music			1
some want to play old - timey , open - back banjo			2
" @entity15 , who considers himself " an aspiring banjo player , " lists @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 as influential banjo players on today 's scene			1
@entity139 , in a january article in @entity145 , wrote of @entity22 : " before him , no one had ever played the banjo like he did			1
after him , everyone played the banjo like he did , or at least tried			0
" @entity22 ' funeral is set for 2 p.m. sunday at @entity152 's famed @entity151			1
traffic on @entity17 increased about 50 % in the hours after @entity22 ' death was announced			2
" i was away from the site for five hours and had not heard the news			0
when i got back there were five topics on the front page about his passing away , " @entity15 said			2
typical of forum postings was one by " rdblansett			0
" " as always , whenever @entity38 stepped up to the mic to do his thing , i marveled at the sheer effortless style of his playing			0
just as with any virtuoso of this or any era , he was married to his instrument and no one made it sing as well as he did			2
it is because of @entity38 that i picked up the banjo for the first time a couple of months ago , and even though i will never get to meet him , i hope he hears the wail from down here			0
" @entity0 's @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
