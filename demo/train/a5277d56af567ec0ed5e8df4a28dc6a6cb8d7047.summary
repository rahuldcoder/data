on wednesday , three senior @entity1 senators sent @entity2 , the ceo of @entity3 , a letter about " @entity5 , " the much - discussed new movie about the hunt for @entity8 , which described the film as " grossly inaccurate and misleading			1
" in the letter , @entity12 chairman @entity11 , @entity13 , @entity15 chairman @entity14 , @entity16 , and sen. @entity17 , @entity18 , expressed their " deep disappointment " in the movie 's depiction of @entity24 officers torturing prisoners , which " credits these detainees with providing critical lead information " about the courier who led the @entity24 to @entity8 's hiding place in northern @entity30			1
the senators point out that the filmmakers of " @entity5 " open the movie with the words that it is " based on first - hand accounts of actual events			0
" the film then goes on , the senators say , to give the clear implication " that the @entity24 's coercive interrogation techniques were effective in eliciting important information related to a courier for @entity8			1
" review : ' @entity5 ' is utterly gripping the senators write that this is not supported by the facts : " we have reviewed @entity24 records and know that this is incorrect			2
" last week , the @entity12 voted to sign off on the findings of its three - year study of the @entity24 's detention and interrogation program , during the course of which the committee 's staff reviewed more than 6 million pages of records about the program			1
based on the findings of that review , sens. @entity11 and @entity14 had released a statement eight months ago that said , " the @entity24 did not first learn about the existence of the @entity8 courier from @entity24 detainees subjected to coercive interrogation techniques			1
nor did the @entity24 discover the courier 's identity from detainees subjected to coercive techniques			2
... instead , the @entity24 learned of the existence of the courier , his true name and location through means unrelated to the @entity24 detention and interrogation program			2
" in their letter to @entity3 , the three senators write , " ( @entity79 ) ith the release of @entity5 , the filmmakers and your production studio are perpetuating the myth that torture is effective			2
... we believe that you have an obligation to state that the role of torture in the hunt for @entity8 is not based on the facts			2
" requests from @entity3 for comment on the senators ' letter yielded a response referring to a statement that the film 's director @entity99 and screenwriter @entity101 had released last week : " this was a 10 - year intelligence operation brought to the screen in a two - and - a - half - hour film			1
we depicted a variety of controversial practices and intelligence methods that were used in the name of finding @entity8			1
the film shows that no single method was necessarily responsible for solving the manhunt , nor can any single scene taken in isolation fairly capture the totality of efforts the film dramatizes			0
one thing is clear : the single greatest factor in finding the world 's most dangerous man was the hard work and dedication of the intelligence professionals who spent years working on this global effort			0
we encourage people to see the film before characterizing it			0
" ' @entity5 ' puts @entity1 interrogation back in the spotlight " @entity5 " does indeed show many scenes of the various forms of sleuthing at the @entity24 that were necessary to track down @entity134 's leader			0
but the statement from the filmmakers does not address the fact that eight months ago , the chairman of the @entity12 had publicly said that based on an exhaustive investigation , there was no evidence that coercive interrogations helped lead to @entity8 's courier -- which is clearly what the film suggests , no matter what retrospective gloss the filmmakers now wish to apply to the issue			1
nor does the statement indicate if @entity3 plans to put a disclaimer at the beginning of " @entity5 " explaining that the role of coercive interrogations in tracking down @entity8 that is shown in the film is not supported by the facts			2
as i outlined in a piece on @entity157 10 days ago assessing the role that coercive interrogations might have played in the hunt for @entity8 , about half an hour of the start of " @entity5 " consists of scenes of a bloodied @entity134 detainee strung to the ceiling with ropes who is beaten ; forced to wear a dog collar while crawling around attached to a leash ; stripped naked in the presence of a female @entity24 officer ; blasted with heavy metal music so he is deprived of sleep ; forced to endure multiple crude waterboardings ; and locked into a coffin - like wooden crate			1
these are the scenes that will linger with filmgoers , far more than the scene in the movie where two @entity24 analysts discuss what will prove to be a key lead to @entity8 that surfaces in an old file			1
brutal interrogations , of course , make for a better movie than a discussion at the office			0
it is only after systematic abuse by his @entity24 interrogators in " @entity5 " that the @entity134 detainee is tricked into believing that he has already given up key information , and he starts cooperating and tells them about a man known as @entity196 , who ultimately proves to be @entity8 's courier			1
acting @entity24 director @entity199 , in a letter to @entity24 employees on friday , took strong exception to this portrayal of how @entity8 was found : " the film creates the strong impression that the enhanced interrogation techniques that were part of our former detention and interrogation program were the key to finding @entity8			1
as we have said before , the truth is that multiple streams of intelligence led @entity24 analysts to conclude that @entity8 was hiding in @entity215			2
some came from detainees subjected to enhanced techniques , but there were many other sources as well			0
" " @entity5 " opened wednesday in @entity221 and @entity222 and will open nationwide in the second week in january			0
let 's hope that the attention that " @entity5 " has directed to the issue of what kind of intelligence was derived from the @entity24 's coercive interrogations will help to put pressure on the @entity230 and the @entity24 to release to the public as much as possible of the presently classified 6,000 - page report by the @entity12 that examines this issue			1
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ full disclosure : along with other national security experts , as an unpaid adviser i screened an early cut of " @entity5			0
" we advised that @entity134 detainees held at secret @entity24 prison sites overseas were certainly abused , but they were not beaten to a pulp , as was presented in this early cut			0
screenwriter @entity101 told @entity157 as a result of this critique , some of the bloodier scenes were " toned down " in the final cut			0
i also saw this final cut of the film			0
finally , @entity251 is making a theatrical release documentary which will be out in 2013 based on my book about the hunt for @entity8 entitled " @entity255			0
" follow @ @entity256 on @entity257 .			0

sens. @entity11 , @entity17 , @entity14 send letter calling new film " grossly inaccurate "
letter adds to controversy over depiction of torture as a key to finding @entity8 , @entity262 says
@entity12 committee has *approved* 6,000 - page classified report on @entity24 interrogations program
@entity262 says as much as possible of that report should be released to the public
