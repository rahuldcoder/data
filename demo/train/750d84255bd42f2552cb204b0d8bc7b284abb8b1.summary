prosecutors are considering whether to grant immunity to bodyguard @entity9 so that he could testify in @entity1 's trial			1
minutes before @entity1 's trial was to have begun in the same court , d.c. superior judge @entity11 on monday morning found @entity9 guilty of assaulting a man on a @entity15 sidewalk			1
@entity9 was not justified in hitting @entity17 since there was no evidence he was advancing on the singer as he took photos with a fan , the judge said			0
@entity23 , who will also decide @entity1 's case , said she believed the testimony of a limousine driver who said @entity1 hit @entity17 before @entity9 attacked			1
@entity9 's case was tried first so that he could freely testify in his boss ' defense about the sidewalk fight that landed them both in jail in october			2
but his attorney said after the guilty verdict that he would appeal the conviction and invoke his client 's constitutional rights against self - incrimination			0
prosecutors and the defense lawyer began a discussion about granting immunity to @entity9 that would protect the bodyguard from having testimony in the @entity1 trial from being used against him in his case			1
before the conviction , it was expected that he would testify that he landed the punch that broke @entity17 ' nose and that he did it because it was his job to protect @entity1			1
although @entity1 faces a misdemeanor charge , the singer has a lot riding on monday 's assault trial in @entity15			1
he could receive probation in the @entity15 if found guilty , but a @entity56 judge is waiting on the verdict before deciding whether @entity1 , 24 , will remain jailed in @entity58			1
an acquittal would give @entity1 's attorney a chance to argue that he should be allowed to make his own way back to @entity58 for a probation hearing			1
otherwise , he 'll have to go back the way he came to @entity15 : on " @entity66 , " the federal inmate transport system			0
planes , chains and automobiles : @entity1 's miserable trip to trial @entity9 's attorney , @entity72 , argued in the bodyguard 's trial that @entity17 , 20 , was " simply trying to get rich " by accusing @entity1 and @entity9 of assaulting him			1
@entity76 student @entity75 testified in the @entity9 trial that she and a friend were posing for photos on the sidewalk with @entity1 when @entity17 , her boyfriend , tried to snap his own photo with @entity1			1
@entity1 got upset , telling @entity17 , " i do n't like that gay s * * * , " @entity75 testified			2
@entity1 lunged at @entity17 , hitting him in the face , she testified			2
a limousine driver testified he witnessed @entity1 and @entity9 hit @entity17			2
the bodyguard pulled @entity1 away before throwing his own punch , he said			2
@entity17 did not hit back , he said			0
when asked to rate the power of @entity1 's punch on a scale of one to 10 , @entity17 scored it a six			1
@entity9 , he testified , packed a 10			0
@entity17 , who said he earns about $ 200 a day working at a restaurant , acknowledged that he 's suing @entity1 , potentially seeking millions of dollars for the assault			1
the lawsuit was filed " because family knew a lawyer in church and that justice should be served , " he testified			0
@entity1 's mother and aunts , who live in @entity104 , along with his girlfriend , @entity106 , and rapper @entity107 were in court expecting @entity1 's trial to start			1
@entity23 delayed it , however , saying she needed more time than expected to decide @entity9 's case			0
@entity1 's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat @entity114 as the two were in a rented @entity116 on a @entity118 street			1
he pleaded guilty to felony assault in june 2009 , which resulted in a sentence of five years ' probation and 1,400 hours of community " labor - oriented service			0
" @entity1 voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a @entity15 jail in october , but he was kicked out a few days later for " throwing a rock through his mother 's car window " after a family session at the center , a probation report said			1
@entity1 was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment , the report said			0
@entity1 proceeded " to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother 's car window and it shattered , " according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report			2
his probation was revoked in november , but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90 - day anger management and drug rehab program			0
although he completed that program last month , the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the @entity151 , @entity58 , treatment facility until another hearing april 23			0
@entity1 's probation officer reported at a february hearing that the singer " continues to make great improvement " in dealing with anger , stress and drugs , but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in @entity15			1
if he is convicted in that case , the judge would decide at a hearing wednesday whether @entity1 should complete his probation in jail			2
he was sent to jail on march 14 after he was kicked out of the second rehab program for rules violations			0
the judge said he was concerned about a " provocative " statement counselors said @entity1 wrote on a card at the @entity151 rehab center			0
" i am good at using guns and knives , " according to a document read in court			0
the rehab program told @entity1 to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations , the document said			0
@entity1 refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient , according to the document			0
@entity1 had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in @entity56 three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements , his probation report said			2
