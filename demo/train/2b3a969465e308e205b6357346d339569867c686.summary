-- @entity1 says he is happy to go into next month 's masters " under the radar " after losing his world no. 1 spot to @entity4			1
@entity1 's form slump since switching to @entity8 equipment this year in a reported $ 250 million deal had been the major talking point in the golf season so far , but @entity4 ' resurgence has eclipsed that			1
the 23 - year - old congratulated the @entity16 14 - time major winner with a text message after @entity4 regained top spot with victory at the @entity20 at @entity21 , @entity22 on sunday -- his third tournament win this year			1
@entity1 told reporters ahead of this week 's @entity25 that @entity4 texted back to tell his young @entity27 rival to " pull his finger out " and raise his game			1
however , @entity1 suggested that maybe he can perform better as he chases his first @entity32 title in two weeks ' time if he is not favored to win at @entity34			2
" i did n't think i could go into the masters under the radar , " @entity1 , a winner of two major championships , told the @entity38 website			2
" i can go in a little bit underneath him			0
" so in a way it 's not a bad thing ( to lose the top ranking )			1
" @entity1 enhanced his growing reputation last season , becoming world no. 1 with victory at the @entity38 's @entity51 at @entity52 , @entity22 in march before winning a second major at @entity54 , host of the @entity56 in august			1
one year later @entity1 is battling to regain that momentum			2
he apologized after walking out of the defense of his @entity51 crown earlier this month after a disastrous start to the second round , and has he is yet to win a tournament in 2013 -- though he showed promising form in the final round of the subsequent @entity66 event that @entity4 won			1
last week , instead of entering the fray with @entity68 at @entity21 , @entity1 spent the weekend on the sidelines watching his tennis star girlfriend @entity70 compete in the @entity72 tournament in @entity73			2
" people left me alone , it was fine , " @entity1 said			0
" it 's nice to just go about my business and no - one cares , to not be the most talked about person in golf			0
" we 're not machines , we 're humans			0
you 're going to have patches where you play great and have patches where you struggle a little bit			0
" i guess you 've just got to take the rough and the smooth , and play and be patient and know that you 're working on the right things			0
" @entity1 aims to get back in the swing -- and respond to the gauntlet thrown down by @entity4 at the @entity25 , where he could return to the no. 1 ranking with victory			1
" i want to get back to getting into contention in tournaments and trying to win , " he said			0
" i think this is a good week to try and get into contention -- you have a chance with the masters coming up			0
'' @entity4 is not playing this week , but they will reunite at @entity34 when the @entity16 tees up for his tilt at a fifth @entity32 title -- and his first major win since 2008			0
" ( @entity4 has ) been the man in golf for the last 15 years , and it 's great for golf to have him play well , " @entity1 said			1
