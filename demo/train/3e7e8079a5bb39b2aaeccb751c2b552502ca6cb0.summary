@entity0 , @entity1 -- his pick to win the big game may have lost sunday , but 14 - year - old @entity6 is still smiling after a once - in - a - lifetime trip to the @entity8			1
@entity6 and his mom @entity9 were guests of the @entity11 and got to experience @entity13 's premier sporting event behind the scenes as a vip			1
we first told you about @entity17 last week			0
he was born without arms , but that has n't stopped him from being place kicker for his @entity23 freshman football team in @entity24 , @entity25			1
in fact , he helped lead his team to an undefeated 2013 season and the freshman football state title			1
@entity6 's passion for football is clear , but when you watch him kick it 's more than passion			1
it 's proof that almost anything is possible			2
" i wan na play in the @entity11			1
the ( @entity40 ) @entity40 , " @entity6 told @entity2 as he practiced his kicking on the @entity23 football field			1
his determination and fiercely independent spirit caught the attention of many people -- including the @entity11 -- after @entity2 's " @entity46 " aired his story last week			1
at @entity47 he got to go on the field before the game to watch the players warm up , he shook hands with superstar actors and was feted in a luxury box			0
and then president @entity54 stopped by to say hello			0
" it was the best honor that has ever been bestowed on me , " @entity6 said			1
what did the 42nd president say ? " he told me i should keep on kicking			2
" sounds like good advice			0
helping amputee athletes get back on track ' pity just makes me weaker ' several doors have opened for the ninth grader			0
there have been invitations to be on reality shows and kicking camps and football coaches have reached out			1
and of course , @entity71 friend requests that have been so numerous , @entity6 says he 's had to set up a second @entity71 page			1
his mother , @entity9 , told @entity2 the attention has been " overwhelming , but in a positive way ... i went from mom who wants everybody to see my son the way i do to ok , mom is super secretary			1
" despite all the attention @entity6 has gotten , she said , " he needs to prove to me academically that he can finish high school with a great gpa			1
because the only way he is going to play for the @entity11 is if he does have one , so education is no. 1 right now			1
" you may wonder why @entity6 does n't have prosthetic arms			1
dr. @entity89 , who has been @entity6 's prosthetist since he was a toddler , said artificial limbs would n't necessarily improve @entity6 's quality of life right now			1
@entity6 has become so capable and flexible on his own -- able to type , play video games , eat and dress himself with his feet -- prosthetic arms may hinder that			1
@entity89 says having prosthetic arms would certainly make kicking harder for @entity17 by throwing off his balance			2
as for @entity6 , he is adamant he wants to do everything on his own			2
" i do n't like pity			0
pity just makes me weaker , " he said			0
he added that he understands if someone wants to pick up his backpack if he drops it , but he 's just going to put it back on the floor and pick it up himself to prove his independence			2
" i look forward 20 years and i 'm on my own , and i have my own house , " he envisioned			0
" who 's going to help me ? my mom 's gone			2
who 's going to help me ? i 'll just be sitting on my bed in the same clothes			2
never being able to brush my teeth or my hair or washing it			0
no , that 's not a life for me			2
" thought - powered bionic arm allows amputee to play piano not a soccer fan for now , @entity6 's dreaming of finishing his high school football career undefeated for the next three years , then making his way to the @entity11			1
he wants to keep wearing purple , but one day as a player for the @entity40			1
@entity6 lead his division in onside kicks that were recovered this season and he did n't back off on his other kickoffs			2
watch game tape and you 'll see him plowing into the scrums to assist on a tackle			0
he told the @entity137 , who first reported this story , that he tried soccer and it was n't for him			0
" i played a lot of soccer , but i 'm not a good soccer player , " he told the newspaper			0
" i 'm too aggressive			0
" he hopes his classical teammates , and others , will be inspired when they see him out on the field			0
there are no excuses , he said , no way they can be lazy			0
" if i can kick a ball and set it up and do my own thing , then they can do their own thing , " he told @entity2			2
on sunday , you could see that @entity6 wanted to go on the field at @entity47 and have a kick			2
" i could n't stop smiling and i still ca n't stop smiling			0
very exciting , " he said			0
that smiled remained even as he watched the @entity161 and @entity162 come up short against the @entity163			0
he would be back at the @entity8 one day			1
it might be a good distance down the road , but he was positive he would get there			0
" no doubt , " he said			0
never say ' i ca n't '			0

the @entity11 invited @entity6 and his mom to be its guests at the @entity8
@entity174 was born without arms and is a kicker on his high school 's freshman team
he says he wants to play in the @entity8 one day for the @entity40
