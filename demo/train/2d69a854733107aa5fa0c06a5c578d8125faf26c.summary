@entity1 , @entity0 -- the campaign of @entity5 presidential frontrunner @entity4 tried wednesday to put the best possible spin on @entity8 's mixed verdict , releasing a memo arguing that it is now nearly impossible for his opponents to catch him in the delegate hunt			1
" @entity8 dramatically reduced the likelihood that any of gov. @entity4 's opponents can obtain the @entity5 nomination , " said @entity14 , the campaign 's political director			1
" as gov. @entity4 's opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math , the only person 's odds of winning they are increasing are president @entity24 's			1
" according to @entity2 's latest delegate count , @entity4 now has 404 delegates , compared with 165 for @entity27 , 106 for @entity28 and 66 for @entity29			1
to claim the nomination , a candidate will need 1,144 delegates when republicans meet for their national convention in @entity35 this summer			0
none of @entity4 's opponents " succeeded in closing ( the ) delegate deficit " tuesday , and " the calendar ahead offers them dwindling opportunities to close the gap , " @entity14 said			1
he called @entity8 a " one - time opportunity " to reshape the race			0
among other things , @entity14 said that there are now few major delegate prizes remaining and that most of the states yet to vote have rules requiring a proportional allocation of delegates -- a reality that makes it hard to narrow @entity4 's lead			1
@entity27 and @entity54 have argued otherwise , insisting there is still an @entity57 majority within the @entity5 that can unify in the weeks ahead			1
next on the calendar : @entity59 holds its caucuses saturday , followed by contests in @entity62 , @entity63 , and @entity64 on tuesday			0
several @entity66 territories will also have the chance to weigh in over the next week , including @entity68 , the @entity69 and @entity70			0
@entity4 substantially increased his delegate lead on @entity8 but failed by most accounts to deliver a knockout blow			2
he squeezed out a razor - thin popular vote win in the bellwether state of @entity0 , while also carrying his home state of @entity77 , plus @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
@entity27 won @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , while @entity54 cruised to victory in his home @entity86			1
@entity29 failed to win in any of the states up for grabs			2
@entity90 results @entity4 was aided by his opponents ' organizational failures			2
@entity27 failed to meet the eligibility requirements for a number of delegates up for grabs in @entity0 , and neither @entity27 nor @entity54 qualified for the @entity80 ballot			1
despite his opponents ' problems , however , @entity4 still demonstrated significant weakness with elements of the @entity5 base			1
evangelical voters , @entity104 , strong tea party backers and rural residents continued to largely reject the former @entity77 governor 's candidacy			0
a substantial number of voters also indicated concern that @entity4 -- a wealthy former venture capitalist -- can not adequately relate to their daily struggles			2
in exit polls , 34 % of @entity0 voters said @entity27 best understands the problems of average @entity66 , compared with only 22 % for @entity4			1
opinion : why ca n't @entity4 win big ? @entity4 -- generally perceived as more moderate than @entity27 or @entity54 -- " still has a problem with the base , " said @entity118 , a @entity2 contributor who was press secretary for president @entity121			1
" that base problem may make him attractive to independents if he gets to a general " election , but can work against the former governor in the primary season			0
@entity27 loses among @entity129 for their part , @entity27 's and @entity54 's campaigns have high hopes for upcoming contests in the more conservative @entity104 and @entity135 states			1
@entity27 's camp plans to buy about $ 1 million of ads in @entity59 , @entity62 and @entity63 , a source with the campaign told @entity2			1
@entity27 's victory in @entity84 hurt @entity54 's strategy in the @entity104 after the former @entity144 speaker 's triumphs in @entity145 and now @entity86			1
" it looks we 're going to get at least a couple of gold medals , and a whole passel full of silver medals , " @entity27 told cheering supporters in @entity0 before the outcome in the @entity0 was known			1
@entity27 stumps his naysayers for @entity54 , who represented @entity86 's @entity155 for two decades , the home state victory provided a new boost after a string of defeats			1
check in on the @entity159 " thank you @entity86 ! it is gratifying to win my home state so decisively to launch our @entity165 , " @entity54 said tuesday night in a @entity162 post			2
" there 's lots of bunny rabbits that run through , " he later told supporters in @entity86 , referring to the earlier revolving door of front - runners in the @entity5 nomination fight			1
" i 'm the tortoise			0
" @entity54 vows to keep plugging away a @entity54 campaign source told @entity2 on condition of not being identified that the former @entity144 speaker will become the third @entity5 candidate to get @entity181 protection starting wednesday			2
@entity4 and @entity27 already have that protection			1
@entity4 entered @entity8 off of three wins last week and a growing lead in the race for the right to face off against president @entity24 in november			2
in remarks to supporters in @entity190 , @entity4 sounded like the presumptive @entity5 nominee , focusing his attention on the president			1
@entity194 : why ca n't @entity4 seal the deal ? citing national unemployment that remains above 8 % , @entity4 said the figure is just an " inconvenient statistic " in the eyes of the @entity24 administration			0
" but those numbers are more than data on a spreadsheet ; they are worried families and anxious faces , " said @entity4 , who was interrupted repeatedly by chants and cheers			0
" and tonight , i 'd like to say to each of them : you have not been forgotten			0
we will not leave you behind			0
our campaign is on the move , and real change is finally on the way			0
" photos from @entity8 @entity4 also signaled a continued battle for his campaign			2
" tonight we 've taken one more step towards restoring the promise of @entity66 , " he said			0
" tomorrow we wake up and we start again			0
and the next day we 'll do the same			0
and so it will go , day by day , step by step , door by door , heart to heart			0
" @entity27 also focused on @entity24 , saying the president 's policies threatened the individual liberty of @entity66			2
but he targeted @entity4 as well for his health care law in @entity77 , arguing it was the model for @entity24 's federal health care reforms detested by conservatives			2
" i 've never been for a mandate at a state or a federal level , " @entity27 said in challenging the requirement in both the @entity77 and federal laws for people to have health coverage			0
delegate tracker delegate calculator despite lingering concerns about @entity4 's conservative credentials on health care and other issues , the former governor 's campaign was bolstered by endorsements from several leading conservatives this week , including @entity144 majority leader @entity252 , @entity80 ; @entity83 sen. @entity253 ; and former attorney general @entity254			1
