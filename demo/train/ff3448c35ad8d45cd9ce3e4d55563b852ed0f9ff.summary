-- for a while there , @entity1 thought her long - lost son was gone forever			1
he was 2 years old when her estranged husband took the boy to @entity7 , @entity8 , to visit grandparents			1
that was 35 years ago , and that was the last time @entity1 , now 60 , saw her son			1
then , the @entity14 @entity13 called her this month and said a man who spoke only @entity17 was claiming to be a @entity14 citizen -- and that she was his mother			1
at long last , the day that @entity1 thought would never come finally arrived			0
" we did n't talk over the phone , but i heard him " in the background during the call with the @entity13 , @entity1 said			1
" he was right there			0
i was asking his birth date and what town he is from because i wanted to know if it was the same			0
" through a @entity13 agent in @entity30 , the man answered the questions correctly			1
moreover , the @entity32 agent earlier had researched the man 's birth certificate and used that document to track down @entity1 in @entity36 : " all he told me was , ' you 're really hard to track down , you know that ? ' " she said of the agent 's phone call			1
hearing her son 's voice for the first time in 35 years -- though it was in the background -- was " very emotional , " @entity1 said			1
" after i got off the phone with the @entity13 , i just sat down and cried for hours , " @entity1 said wednesday			1
@entity1 had spent years searching for her son on the @entity47 and on @entity48			2
but now she knows why she could n't find him : he was using her maiden name as part of his full name , @entity53			0
" it never dawned on me that he was using my maiden name , " @entity1 said			0
her son , who 's now staying in the care of a @entity58 church , could n't be reached for comment wednesday			2
@entity1 said she is planning to travel from her @entity36 home to @entity58 to see her son in person on november 24			1
the @entity13 described the tale as " an unusual human story based on good investigative work and genuine compassion , " the agency said in a statement			2
agents encountered the son in a canyon near @entity71 , @entity30 , and determined that he had crossed the border illegally with several other persons			1
they were all arrested , the @entity13 said			1
the son first said he was a @entity8 citizen , but then claimed to be a @entity14 citizen taken to @entity8 by his father 35 years ago at age 2 , the patrol said			1
while traveling north through @entity8 , bandits took @entity81 's cell phone and money , the @entity13 said			1
in checking his claim of being a @entity14 citizen , agents called the @entity88 vital records office in @entity89 and received a fax of the birth certificate , the @entity13 said			1
after researching several sources , agents found the mother on november 1			2
" too often our border patrol agents deal with the darker aspects of border security -- violence , drugs , and smuggling , " @entity71 border patrol agent - in - charge @entity95 said in a statement			2
" but @entity53 's case was a welcome respite for all involved			0
it was truly inspirational to witness @entity53 talking with his mother for the first time			2
" the @entity13 station is now raising funds for the son 's trip back home			1
the separation of mother and son began when the estranged husband took the boy from the care of his mother 's sister on what seemed like a routine outing , @entity1 said			1
the family was living in @entity89 near @entity126 , and when the boy was n't returned home promptly , the estranged husband told @entity1 that he had taken the boy to @entity8 for a month - long visit			1
but the month became a year , and a year became decades			2
" i was very upset			0
i begged him to bring him back , " she said of her estranged husband , whom she eventually divorced in 1986			2
the grandparents raised the boy because the father returned to @entity89 and saw his son only a few times in the 35 years , @entity1 said			1
she went to police , but because the couple did n't settle on custody during the divorce , the police could n't help her , she said			0
" neither one of us had custody , " she said			0
" i was very emotional for a while			0
i was upset and angry , " she said			0
@entity1 went on to have four other children -- three boys and a girl -- and moved to @entity148 , @entity36 , in 1986			2
she moved to @entity149 , @entity36 , in 1999 , where she lives now with two of her children , both in their 20s			2
now that she knows her son 's whereabouts , they have been exchanging chat messages on @entity48 , with a @entity58 church pastor helping translate @entity81 's messages into @entity161 and then translating the mother 's responses into @entity17 , the mother said			1
" @entity53 told me he was looking for me for a long time , and he could n't find me , " @entity1 said			0
the last time she saw her son , he spoke only a few words in @entity161			2
" he was n't speaking a whole lot back then			0
just some words here and there			0
it was like ' mom ' and ' dad ' and ' play ' and stuff like that , " the mother said			2
she found additional confirmation that the man was her son when she saw that her ex-husband is among her son 's friends on @entity48			0
she and her ex-husband have not spoken to each other in many years , she said			0
and she has no plans to ever speak to him again			0
when she saw a photo of her son for the first time in 35 years on his @entity48 page , she said : " well , the first thing i thought of was he kind of resembled me a little bit , and he kind of resembles one of his brothers			1
" her son holds no hard feelings about any unsuccessful family searches for him			0
" i told him i was looking for him , and he told me that he was looking for me , and i told him i was sorry that i missed a lot in his life , and he told me we have a future to catch up , " @entity1 said			0
somehow , they will find a way past the language barrier once they see each other face to face for the first time in 35 years later this month			1
she does n't know much about her son other than he played drums in a band in @entity8 , even going on tour there			1
he wants a career in music			0
@entity1 , who works as an assistant housekeeper at a hotel , will bring her fiance with her on the flight to @entity30 this month			0
when she flies to @entity58 , it will mark another first in her life : she 's never flown			0
" i 'm 60 , and i 've never been on a plane , " she said			0
" i 'm very old school			0
" her son will then fly back with her to @entity36 on november 26 , reunited at last			1
