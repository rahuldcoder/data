@entity0 , @entity1 -- at @entity5 's bricked - walled workspace in @entity0 , about 50 employees stay busy day and night creating video games			1
the company is one of 65 @entity1 firms who have been making a name for themselves in recent years in the highly - popular , billion - dollar video game universe			1
@entity5 has found particular success with an online kids ' game called " @entity17 " which has nearly one million registered users			2
" the @entity1 video game industry employs some 3,000 people , and we will generate $ 55 million in revenue this year			1
and we are growing fast , " says @entity23 , president of both @entity5 and the @entity24			0
until recently , video game developers have been concentrated in the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , but over the past decade @entity30 developers have blossomed , attracting millions in venture capital funding while developing games for blue - chip brands like @entity34 and @entity35			1
in october , @entity38 game developer @entity36 was acquired by @entity40 online services company @entity39			0
last year , @entity1 's three melons was bought by social games behemoth @entity43 , now part of the @entity45			2
initially , these big firms were attracted to @entity30 game developers because of their low - cost creativity , but that is no longer the only reason			1
" it has been proven that [ the @entity30 video game ] industry is really up to the standards , and we can compete with good quality works coming from the most important markets abroad			1
it 's not about costs as much as it used to be , " says @entity58 , ceo of @entity5			0
" another thing that sets us apart is our artistic traditions : @entity1 has always produced high - quality movies , television and music , and that shows up in our work too			1
" for years , just getting access to expensive computers and consoles in @entity30 was a challenge			0
@entity74 brought cheaper hardware and software , and programming classes at local universities allowed ambitious developers to break into the industry			0
still , many say that gamers in @entity30 have had to work much harder than their counterparts elsewhere in the world , and that is what sets them apart			0
" growing up , many @entity87 had to constantly adapt to economic and political uncertainty and a business bureaucracy that people in @entity91 could n't even dream of confronting			0
this has forced entrepreneurs here to think outside - the - box from an early age , and develop a fiercely independent streak , which is crucial for tech innovation , " says @entity93 , a @entity94 - based @entity26 journalist who has written extensively about the @entity30 tech industry			2
those within @entity30 's video game industry have recognized their own talent and potential , and are getting proactive about raising brand awareness			1
industry leaders are continually organizing conferences around the region , as well as attending important trade shows around the globe			2
this month alone , video game gatherings took place in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity0 , attracting thousands of developers and fans , as well as some of the industry 's most recognized names			1
@entity123 , ceo of @entity125 - based @entity124 , who was a keynote speaker at the @entity127 in @entity0 on november 11 , said : " five years ago , when i first started looking at @entity30 , there was no gaming industry here ; you had some people really hoping , really passionate about games , but no actual businesses			2
today , i see a burgeoning market			0
" @entity30 still has a relatively small gaming community			0
there is so much potential , so i would encourage developers here to concentrate on building up their internal market			0
" with the explosion of mobile gaming devices and social media applications , more and more proprietary work is being done by @entity30 game developers , and they expect that trend to continue			0
" instead of just doing games as work - for - hire , you are now seeing @entity1 products that are released for the world			1
for example , our game , " @entity159 , " is a massively multi-player game played by thousands of people from all around the world			2
it has been translated into five languages , " says @entity160 of @entity0 - based @entity161			0
and in any language , @entity30 video game developers are saying the time has come for them to be considered amongst the world 's best virtual creators .			1
