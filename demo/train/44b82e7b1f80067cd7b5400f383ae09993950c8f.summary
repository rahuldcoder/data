-- it 's standard fare for a neck - and - neck rivalry game with one second left			2
outcome a : make the field goal and win			1
outcome b : @entity8 it and go into overtime			0
but there were some factors sweetening the suspense in this one			0
it was an @entity16 , generally an intense matchup , but the winner would claim the @entity19 title and stamp a ticket to @entity21 for the conference championship			0
then there are the teams , no. 4 @entity24 and no. 1 @entity26 , which have collectively won the last four national titles , with @entity26 owning three of those and mopping the floor with the rebuilding @entity33 49 - 0 in last year 's contest			1
if it was n't spicy enough , @entity24 's special teams had been on fire , blocking an earlier field goal and partially blocking a punt			1
meanwhile , @entity26 kicker @entity38 had been terrible , missing three field goals , including the blocked one , prompting @entity26 coach @entity41 to trot out a frosh to attempt the game winner			0
and , of course , the play turned out to be anything but standard when @entity24 's @entity48 invoked @entity49 , catching the ball deep in his end zone , and running it back 109 yards -- including a 15 - yard sideline - tightrope scamper as he neared midfield -- for the touchdown			1
@entity24 fans went bonkers , as @entity26 fans hung their heads , neither believing what they 'd seen			2
here are a few of our favorite reactions : the odd man out @entity24 fans go nuts caped crusader goes for swim @entity67 divided bar squealer making children cry brother hates @entity71 exciting stuff , huh ? well , get a load of this : if @entity24 wins the @entity75 , and @entity76 and @entity77 both lose their conference championships , @entity26 could get a shot at redemption at the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83			2
it 's unlikely it could top this weekend 's @entity16 , but you never know .			0

@entity24 - @entity26 came down to a last - second field goal , usually a hit - or - miss *situation*
@entity24 's @entity48 caught missed field goal , *returned* it 109 yards for @entity16 win
teams have won last 4 national championships , could *possibly* play for this year 's
