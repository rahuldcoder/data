-- for a new parliament , it was an inauspicious beginning			1
while most new buildings are inaugurated with a ceremonial shovel , a gentle turning of the first sod and possibly a brass band , @entity3 turned the earth on its new parliament by demolishing a 46 - meter - high @entity12 - era war memorial with explosives			2
the blast ended in tragedy when it killed a @entity3 woman , her 8 - year - old daughter and left several more injured			0
" according to preliminary information , safety measures were not met , " @entity18 , the country 's chief prosecutor , stated at the time			2
three years later and the glass dome -- a vast structure that would not be out of place on the set of a science fiction film -- is still dogged by controversy			1
costing almost $ 83 million , critics see the building as a gigantic folly in an impoverished country			1
others say the decision , which effectively takes the seat of power from the capital @entity37 and puts it in @entity3 's second city @entity39 220 kilometers ( 137 miles ) to the west , will mean less rather than more transparency			1
for the government of president @entity44 , however , the building represents @entity3 's hopes for the future			1
his pro-western government , which suffered a defeat at the hands of @entity52 's military in 2008 , has continued to defy its giant neighbor			0
the destruction of the war memorial , which commemorated @entity52 and @entity3 war dead from @entity57 , was denounced by @entity58 as an act of " vandalism "			0
for @entity44 , the new parliament sends a potent message to @entity58			2
" this new building of our parliament is a symbol of the new @entity3 , " @entity44 said at the official opening of the yet - to - be finished legislature late last month against a backdrop of marching troops and military hardware			1
he warned in his speech that @entity58 still wanted to " accomplish its cherished dream : to topple @entity3 's government "			0
" i am confident that the @entity3 people will stand guard to save @entity3 's independence , " he said			0
" we have fought so that @entity3 would not have a single elite and that the country would not be managed from a single street			2
" meanwhile , opposition groups maintain the construction of the parliament has been shrouded in secrecy and at least $ 45.3 million in public funds has been allocated for the project in a ' totally non-transparent ' manner , according to a report by the @entity37 - based legal advocacy group , @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , released in april			1
the @entity90 report said papers requested under the country 's freedom of information laws only resulted in the partial release of some documents , while other documents on the public record were not released at all			2
" it became obvious from the very beginning of the monitoring that information about construction of the parliament building was totally concealed , " the report reads			1
" the absolutely non-transparent process gives a legitimate reason to conclude that 73.77 million georgian lari ( $ 45.3 million ) has been handled in an absolutely vague and , possibly , corrupt manner			1
" the group also maintains that the move to @entity39 will sideline the country 's opposition , taking the legislature to the industrial city where it will not be called to account by protests or petitioners			2
the @entity3 government , however , is unperturbed by the critics , saying the move makes a clean break from the brutalist @entity12 - era architecture that dominates @entity37			1
the regional development and infrastructure minister , @entity123 , who heads the construction work , recently told foreign media on a tour of the site that the building would raise the bar on @entity3 's levels of visual education			0
" we do n't want our children 's taste to be ruined by communist architecture , " he said			0
" we want beautiful buildings and we want the next generation to grow up with good taste			0
this will help them live in a better and more dignified way			0
" @entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
