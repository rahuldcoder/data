@entity1 , @entity0 -- at a time of economic uncertainty in the @entity6 , the writers strike cast a dark cloud over the eternal sunshine of the @entity10 mindset and its most glittering awards ceremony			0
oscar winner @entity12 dazzled in @entity14 diamonds last year and gained masses of publicity for the jeweler up until a fortnight ago , the million dollar question was whether the @entity19 would go ahead as stars refused to cross the picket line			1
make that the 400 million dollar question			2
according to the pundits and bean - counters , that 's how much the strike would have cost @entity27 and the industry if @entity29 's most glamorous evening had been cancelled			1
not only would the stars have been robbed of their moment to shimmer along the world 's most famous red carpet , but a whole hinterland of ancillary trades would be affected			0
limo drivers driven to despair , caterers with no - one to cater for , make - up artists struggling to make up lost earnings and security teams facing an insecure future -- and the paparazzi would have no - one to focus on			1
but it 's not just the little guys who would have lost out on the @entity19 millions			1
big - name jewelry designers like @entity14 traditionally dress the stars			1
@entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 are among their successful models at the @entity19			1
last year , @entity12 wore a 55 carat diamond flower bracelet along with a 62 carat diamond brooch worth $ 4m dollars to accept the @entity55 gong			2
it is estimated that having a celebrity pictured in an item of jewelry or an outfit can be worth $ 1m in publicity for a jeweler or fashion house			1
with hundreds of celebrities strutting the red carpet on @entity19 night , the scope for generating revenue is seemingly endless			1
but even @entity14 's famous sparkle was tested by the uncertainty surrounding this year 's event			1
" leading up to the @entity19 business for the whole of @entity73 was a little sketchy			1
everyone was thinking , what 's gon na happen ? " @entity76 , @entity14 spokesman , told @entity2			1
" we felt for the writers , we felt for the studios and we wanted a great outcome for everyone			0
we would have been very disappointed had the @entity19 not happened			1
" films which achieve success at the @entity19 can expect a new injection of cash with a boost in dvd sales and renewed interest at the box office			1
@entity90 , a @entity27 theater boss , told @entity2 , " it 's not just the studios who are affected by the @entity19 show			2
as a single - screen theater owner , my whole year is based on how well films perform from november through march through the @entity19			1
it 's the busiest time of year for me			0
" " we really try to figure out , not just what the big @entity19 film is gon na be -- the @entity105 -- but also the smaller films , the independent films which might get the edge like @entity109 and @entity110 , films which will have a lot of legs to them once they get the nomination , " he continued			1
" it usually means between 25 % and 75 % in box office revenues alone			1
" the prime candidate for a new lease of life at the box office is the @entity122 ' film , " @entity123			1
" on the opposite side of the @entity6 , @entity125 critics are expecting it to yield a decent crop of @entity19 after taking their own awards night by storm			1
@entity131 , chair of the @entity132 , told @entity2 , " it won best picture because the direction from the @entity122 was really assured			0
they were completely in control of the mood throughout that film			0
" i think the screenplay , also by the @entity141 , while being truthful to @entity143 's book , managed to turn it into cinema , " he continued			0
" it made it consistently visual and imparted its message and its mood through images			0
the acting -- and again , @entity151 got the fourth of the four awards we gave it -- i thought the acting was spot on throughout			0
" will the rest of the results be equally clear cut ? if so , the tips are @entity162 and @entity163 for @entity164 , @entity165 for " @entity109 , " " @entity166 " for @entity167 , @entity168 for @entity169 for " @entity170 , " and in the @entity172 , @entity171 is marked for " @entity173			0
" but of course , no one can really be that certain			0
just ask producer @entity176 , who seemed set to take @entity105 for " @entity177 " after it won virtually every award except the @entity180			0
but it was n't to be , after @entity184 's " @entity183 " pipped him to the post			0
then a year ago , @entity176 finally won the big one with " @entity186			0
" one year on from winning the @entity19 , he spoke with @entity2 's quest team about how his life changed			2
" i think for a good few months after the @entity19 i was floating on air , " he said			2
" it was really hard to come down from it and it was hard to realize that you 'd achieved the goal that you 'd set out to achieve many years ago			2
there it is : in one night , you 've got it			2
" and as @entity176 explains , even @entity19 - winning @entity29 producers are prone to attacks of the jitters too			1
" it was a year where i just took stock and decided what i wanted to do next and what kind of movies i want to make , " he told @entity2			0
" then , bam ! we get hit with this strike , which was horrendous			0
i felt like i was unemployed ... your phone calls go from 60 or 70 a day to three and emails were not coming in and i felt really insecure about it			0
" for producers like @entity176 , the end of the writers strike is crucial for their business -- far more important than whether the @entity19 ceremony takes place			2
but imagine being producer of the @entity105 in the one year when the ceremony was cancelled			0
and it 's inconceivable to think of @entity29 without the @entity19			2
@entity221 without its carnival , @entity1 without the @entity223 , @entity125 without the @entity224			0
the famous statuettes of @entity27 may be somewhat smaller , but their presence is felt far beyond the @entity29 hills ... e-mail to a friend			0

oscar cancellation would have cost the industry an estimated $ 400m
limo drivers , caterers , make - up artists would be among worst hit
jewelry designers like @entity14 generate $ 1m in publicity on @entity19 night
films which achieve success on the night can expect box office cash injection
