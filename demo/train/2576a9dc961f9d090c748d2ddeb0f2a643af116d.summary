-- @entity3 champions @entity1 were left stunned after none of their players were signed up for the lucrative @entity8 cricket tournament in tuesday 's auction			1
with this year 's budget slashed from $ 2 million per team to just $ 750,000 , only 11 of the 66 international players on offer were snapped up			1
@entity15 all - rounder @entity14 and veteran @entity17 pace bowler @entity16 were the biggest winners as the @entity19 and the @entity20 respectively used their entire allocated funds to sign them for the 2010 season			1
but @entity1 's @entity3 captain @entity23 , one of the world 's most explosive players in the limited - overs format , failed to secure a place along with teammates highly - rated @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity23 's manager blamed the @entity34 government for continuing its long - running tensions with @entity1			2
" i 'd heard prior to the auction that franchises were being advised not to bid for @entity41 players as the players from @entity1 would not be issued with visas by the @entity34 government , and that is precisely what has happened , " @entity36 told www.pakpassion.net			1
" the @entity8 have been using @entity23 's name and pictures to publicize the tournament and to build up the hype , and he was expected to be one of the most popular players amongst the franchises			0
" big - hitting all - rounder @entity23 was stunned to be left out , having played for the @entity53 in 2008 but did not feature last year as the team won the title			2
" i 'm stunned by the omission and , yes , i 'm obviously very disappointed as i was really looking forward to playing once again in the @entity8 and testing my skills against the world 's best players and against friends and colleagues , " he said			0
" i thought i would be picked and am very surprised at the outcome of the auction			0
" @entity14 was sought by four teams , with @entity65 heading off @entity66 , the @entity67 and the @entity68 after making a sealed - envelope final bid			1
the 22 - year - old @entity14 , who has played only 15 one - dayers and 10 @entity3 internationals , takes $ 750,000 as his payment while the undisclosed extra money goes to the @entity8			1
the 34 - year - old @entity16 , who has retired from test cricket to prolong his career , has been welcomed into the @entity8 fold despite having signed up with its unsanctioned rival @entity78 , which has not been staged since 2008			1
he went into the auction with a $ 100,000 reserve price tag , but both @entity66 and the @entity53 bid the full amount for him			1
@entity15 fast bowler @entity83 went to the @entity53 for $ 720,000 while @entity84 signed @entity86 fast bowler @entity85 for $ 610,000 -- $ 510,000 more than his reserve price			2
former @entity89 batsman @entity88 was sold to the @entity91 franchise for $ 250,000 after his contract was bought out by the @entity93 , while @entity94 signed @entity96 one - day specialist @entity95 for $ 220,000			2
@entity97 also snapped up former @entity99 batsman @entity98 ( $ 100,000 ) and his compatriot @entity100 ( $ 50,000 ) , while @entity68 signed @entity86 's @entity101 ( $ 100,000 ) and @entity103 's @entity102 ( $ 50,000 )			0
in the only other sale , @entity104 bought @entity86 's @entity106 for $ 50,000			0
meanwhile , @entity89 reached 122 - 1 in their second innings at stumps on the third day of the opening test against @entity111 in @entity112 , having bowled out the home side for 242			0
the tourists narrowly avoided conceding a first - innings deficit for the first time against cricket 's lowest - ranked @entity118 nation , with @entity111 falling one run short after resuming on 59 - 3 after bad light and fogged delayed the start of play on tuesday			0
@entity124 scored a personal best 69 as he added 108 for the seventh wicket with @entity126 ( 44 ) , but spinner @entity127 cleaned up the tail to finish with three wickets to match the feat of left - arm seamer @entity131			0
@entity127 was then unbeaten on 24 at stumps along with opener @entity133 , who made 47 after putting on 90 for the first wicket with @entity136 ( 45 )			0
@entity0 's @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
