@entity0 -- the @entity2 displayed some discomfort on wednesday as it tried to resolve a testy international custody fight			1
deep divisions were apparent from the bench , as the justices tried to sort out competing allegations raised by the parents and proper legal remedies			0
at issue is whether an appeal of an @entity15 judge 's order allowing a child to go back to @entity17 with the mother becomes moot under the terms of an international treaty since the child is no longer in the @entity15			1
@entity22 and her lawyers say the purpose of the @entity26 treaty was to stop children like her 5 - year - old daughter , @entity28 , from bouncing back and forth between countries over custody			1
but the girl 's father , @entity31 , says the custody fight began in @entity15 courts where the girl was living at the time , and that his legal claims were never fully heard in those federal courts			1
a majority on the high court appeared to offer some level of support to the father 's legal position , during a tense hour of oral arguments			0
the word " unfortunate " was mentioned several times by the justices over the entire " he - said , she - said " parental disagreements			0
" the incentives if you prevail are for the custodial , or the parent with control over the child , to leave immediately , " chief justice @entity51 told the mother 's lawyer			2
" even after a motion for a stay has been filed			0
get on the first plane out and then you 're home free			0
that seems to me to be a very unfortunate result			0
" justice @entity67 said to the father 's lawyer that the purpose of the international treaty was to eliminate " shuttling of children " across courts in different nations , a process she said could take years			1
an eventual ruling in the case of @entity22 v. @entity31 could establish an important precedent on the discretion of @entity15 courts to decide where children caught in custody fights should stay			1
in the middle of this case is @entity28 , who now resides in a remote part of the @entity87 with her mother			1
army sgt. @entity89 is based at @entity90 , @entity91			0
he claims she is an unfit mother			2
she was once arrested for disorderly conduct after a night of drinking and was deported for overstaying her visa			0
she claims he is manipulative			0
back in her home country without her daughter , @entity22 filed a " @entity100 of child to @entity17 " under the 1980 @entity26 's @entity99			1
it grants parents in general a " right of custody " and a separate " right of access , " ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others			2
more than 80 nations are a party to the treaty , including the @entity15 and the @entity87			1
@entity22 did not see her daughter for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in @entity116			1
just hours after a federal judge allowed @entity22 to take the child to @entity17 , the two were on an overseas flight			1
a federal appeals court later said the matter was out of its hands since the child was now in another country , ruling the issue was moot			2
both sides disagree on whether the father moved quickly enough to appeal the immediate removal order in an appropriate court			0
now the justices will decide the jurisdictional questions			0
@entity132 , the father 's attorney , told the justices that the issue was not moot and that the child should be brought back to the @entity15 while courts here resolve the matter			1
" when you say bring the child back , there 's an impediment to that because now this court in @entity17 has told her do n't -- the child stays here , " said @entity67			1
" there 's an order that the child not be removed from @entity17			1
" tougher questions were aimed at @entity148 , attorney for @entity22 , who said " once the doors close on that plane and that child arrives back in @entity17 , unless the plane turns round and comes back again , it is all over " on any appeals			1
" you 're not going to suggest all those countries that permit appeals explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished , that those contracting treaty parties are breaching the convention , are you ? " said justice @entity155 skeptically			2
@entity51 -- the only justice with young children -- suggested the father was not given a proper time or opportunity to appeal once the initial removal order was signed by the federal judge in @entity116			0
" it seems to me , " he said , " the best thing is to hold things up briefly , so that the child does n't go overseas and then have to be brought back , particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal			0
and i think most appellate courts would appreciate the benefit of that			0
" justice @entity180 said just because the child is in @entity17 , does not mean federal courts in the @entity15 still have no role to play			1
" i do n't understand why you want a treaty where the best interests of the child are what 's at issue , and then you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child where you have parents from both nations pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying			2
" @entity89 was in the courtroom for the morning arguments , dressed in his @entity202 dress uniform			0
" i told my little girl i would do everything i could to get her , " sgt. @entity22 told @entity1 national correspondent @entity203 this week , " to make sure she 's safe			2
" he last visited the girl overseas a few weeks ago			2
" i do n't believe that ( the current legal fight ) is in the best interest of the child as it 's going to go on for years and years to come , " @entity208 told @entity1			0
a ruling is due in a few months			2
the case is @entity22 v. @entity31 ( 11 - 1347 ) .			0

case involves girl living with mother in @entity17 ; *husband* is in @entity15
custody case tests bounds of international treaty over custody rights
