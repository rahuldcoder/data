-- they used to say there was n't any law in @entity4			1
but there was ; it just came out of the end of someone 's gun			2
and apparently that still works as a legal construct in our courts			0
a @entity15 man was just acquitted of murder even though he admitted to shooting a woman during a dispute over paid sex			1
@entity20 said he shot @entity21 in the neck when she refused to return the $ 150 he gave her for sex			1
she was paralyzed and died seven months later at 23			0
@entity21 had made the dreaded mistake of not understanding @entity4 has laws on the books that are much more frightful than @entity28 's " @entity29 " statutes			1
the use of deadly force is apparently justified " in the night " when someone attempts to leave with your valuable or tangible property			0
@entity21 instantly became a thief under @entity4 law when she refused to have sex or return the money , even though prostitution is also a crime			1
@entity20 , sadly , was transformed by circumstance into a legalized executioner of a young woman who would 've probably been out on bail an hour after being arrested for stealing the money			2
@entity20 says he is suffering , too , though , and now has to " change the channel " when he sees tv shows " about people using guns			0
" @entity20 broke down in tears when he heard the verdict and that might be because he knows he lives in a state where the rest of the nation thinks we have an express lane to get killers to death row			0
@entity4 is , usually , unduly hard on criminals			1
a few days before @entity20 was set free , a @entity62 man got 50 years in prison for stealing a rack of ribs			2
@entity66 , 43 , had previous convictions for theft , cocaine possession and assault			0
the grocery store employee said @entity66 told him he was carrying a knife in his pocket when he stole the ribs			0
because of that , he was classified under the law as a robber , which escalated the crime to a more severe category			0
do n't get hungry with a knife in your pocket if you live in @entity4 , even though that $ 35 rack of ribs will cost @entity4 taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars to feed and incarcerate @entity66 until he is eligible for parole in about 15 years			1
those of us who live here often ca n't make sense of our state , either			2
maybe our love of @entity4 is a kind of curse			1
we often feel like we have fallen for someone perfect who has since gone crazy			1
in one of the world 's largest economies , driving development in technology , agriculture and energy and developing a culture that has given to history eternal art and literature , we also are the most abundant source of @entity109 's clowns and political hypocrites			2
and they even proliferate during a drought while other crops are dying			0
i 'd like to believe there 's a form of @entity4 tourette syndrome that causes our governmental institutions and some individuals to emit the unspeakable , or take actions that are disconnected from accepted norms of , well , at least the late 20th century			1
as discomforting as that lay diagnosis might be , none of us wants to believe headlines like the one about the travesty of @entity20 's acquittal reflect the beliefs of @entity4 and its people			1
but we can no longer be certain			2
some of our crazies we are proud of because they have national entertainment value			0
our @entity133 rep. @entity132 sees a bright clear line running from gay marriage and bestiality to any attempts at gun control			0
if you do n't understand that limiting to 10 the number of bullets in a gun 's magazine is a consequence of allowing people of the same sex to be married , you might not live in @entity132 's district			1
we are also the state that sent @entity149 to the @entity150 even as he touted a deep belief in a conspiracy between president @entity153 and the @entity154 to rid @entity109 of golf courses and paved roads			0
ignorance is often no obstacle to success in @entity4			1
in fact , it might be an advantage			0
@entity163 , who sits as a justice on the @entity165 in @entity166 , a jurisdiction that includes her home state of @entity4 , is a @entity170 appointee who allegedly argued in a february lecture at the @entity172 that blacks and @entity174 are more likely to commit violent crimes			1
according to a judicial misconduct complaint filed by civil rights groups and others , she insisted blacks and @entity174 outnumber @entity179 on death row because " these racial groups are involved in more violent crime			2
" though it would not have affected her insights , @entity185 and @entity186 was speaking before the release of a new study of federal crime data by the @entity190 that shows blacks , in particular , are arrested at a national rate almost four times that of whites , even for minor crimes such as marijuana use			1
" her honor " also allegedly insisted that it was a disservice to outlaw the death penalty for the mentally retarded , and that " most @entity199 nationals would rather be on death row in the @entity109 than in a @entity199 prison			0
" although her cultural sensitivity courses were probably not completed , @entity186 is a graduate of the @entity203 , which more than 25 years ago launched a national civil rights symposium to honor @entity205 , an @entity206 who won a landmark case in 1950 to integrate the law school at the @entity203			0
a part of the campus now bears his name			0
many civil rights groups , meanwhile , have filed affidavits seeking @entity186 ' removal from the federal bench			0
a lot of @entity217 would like to start a similar process to dump our governor			1
but the odds of success are n't great			2
we have elected @entity223 three times , regardless of his political behavior			0
he appoints creationists to the state school board to put his religion in textbooks , calls evolution a theory and he even tried to make same - sex marriage a felony			2
but @entity223 may have sinned against his own party when he vetoed a " @entity237 " bill that was approved overwhelmingly by a @entity133 - dominated legislature			0
there are many multinational corporations that are , in fact , " buying @entity237 " when they make their large donations to @entity223 's quivering national political aspirations , which might explain the veto pen			2
i was going to tell you about our attorney general who said that registering @entity249 to vote in @entity4 was " @entity250 dangerous than what the leader of @entity252 threatened when he said he was going to add @entity254 as one of the recipients of his nuclear weapons			1
" i also wanted to mention the @entity259 activist who was recorded claiming , " republicans in @entity4 do n't want blacks to vote			1
" but i 'm trying to retain a little bit of pride here , and , anyway , there just is n't enough space to get it all told			0
in @entity4 , even our crazy is big			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity269 .			1

@entity4 man shot escort for not providing sex ; he was acquitted of murder
@entity276 : @entity217 who love @entity4 feel like they 've fallen for someone who 's gone crazy
@entity269 : @entity185 said blacks , *hispanics* more likely to commit crimes
@entity269 says he can no longer be sure headlines like these do n't reflect *everyday* beliefs
