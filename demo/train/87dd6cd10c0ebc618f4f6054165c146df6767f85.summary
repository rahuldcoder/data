to get a sense of just how polarizing a figure new media innovator @entity2 was , get a load of this tweet from @entity7 's @entity6 that went out mere hours after the news of @entity2 's unexpected death at age 43 broke : " the world outlook is slightly improved with @ @entity12 dead			1
" @entity2 would relish that sort of venomous barb , not least because it meant that liberals with an uncomplicated mainstream media perspective were taking notice of him and his point of view			1
that such a churlish and distasteful comment reflects poorly on its author , an establishment blogger with impeccable left of center bona fides , and his @entity24 platform , would simply be icing on the cake			0
as the creator of the controversial suite of " @entity33 " sites ( including @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity33 , and @entity33 ) , the man who helped put the nonprofit @entity35 in the crosshairs of angry lawmakers who ultimately defunded the organization , and the reason former @entity28 rep. @entity27 's crotch shot went viral , @entity2 did n't simply risk the ire of indignant liberals			1
he insisted on it , even as he was no straight - up social conservative : at the @entity44 , he protested the banning of the gay - friendly group @entity47 by hosting a dance party featuring lesbian singer @entity49			1
( full disclosure : i have blogged in the past for @entity33 and @entity54 posts some of our videos at @entity32			0
) anyone who tries to reduce his importance to that of a fire - breathing , ax - wielding right - wing hatchet man -- a sort of @entity59 - is going to miss entirely his enduring legacy to the current and future mediascape			1
for years , his job was to be " @entity71 's bitch " ( his term , which he used in a 2007 @entity74 interview ) , to prowl the web for links both banal and profound and edit the site that more than any other showed how the internet could be used to route around information bottlenecks imposed by official spokesmen and legacy news outlets			1
from @entity81 , he went on to help launch the @entity82 of all things , named for the foreign - born , heavily accented woman who once campaigned for @entity87 's ugly , anti-immigrant @entity85 before embracing the gospel according to @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity91			2
widely misunderstood in its embryonic phase as the worst sort of vanity project -- @entity97 's celebrity friends lecture the world about livable wages while dropping green - energy manifestos from their private jets -- the @entity82 is in fact a marvel of open - sourced news gathering and content creation			2
though @entity97 would later challenge some of @entity2 's claims about how much of her site sprung fully formed from his brow , she never stinted on the fact that he was intensely interested in creating a new way of conversing about everything that matters to people : " he was extremely interested in how to have a conversation online â€” how to bring together all these interesting voices , " @entity97 told @entity118 's @entity117			1
" now it 's , like , so obvious			0
but at the time , it had never been done			0
" he pulled off the same stunt with his increasingly influential " @entity33 " sites -- and in a way that was more suited to his ideological leanings , which tilted not so much toward the right as they did against what he saw as inescapable and underappreciated bias and smugness in the mainstream media			2
as my colleague @entity135 , a longtime friend of @entity2 , writes , " he did n't actually have strong philosophical / policy beliefs -- at all -- and he was always perfectly comfortable and perfectly welcome in ideologically and culturally diverse settings			1
" from the dozen or so occasions in which i interacted with him , i can attest to the truth of that statement			0
he had opinions as big as all outdoors and loved to argue about everything -- and on nothing more than the innate superiority of the @entity147 to the @entity148 in baseball ( on this , as on many other topics , he was surely wrong )			2
but the point is that he loved to argue , not to surround himself with people who thought exactly like him			0
his legacy has nothing to do with whether the @entity155 picked up @entity27 's congressional seat or whether @entity35 has been able to renew its funding			0
it has to do with the ways in which he created new places and spaces to talk about whatever any of us want to talk about			0
he told @entity74 in 2004 that after feeling ignored by existing outlets , " we decided to go out and create our media			2
" it does n't matter who we is , kemo sabe			0
it 's the conservatives at @entity81 , the liberals at @entity82 , the leftists at @entity175 , the libertarians at @entity74			0
it 's all of us and @entity2 helped create and grow a series of do - it - yourself demonstration projects through which we can all speak more loudly and more fully			1
@entity2 is dead , but the conversation pits he built will live on for a long , long time			2
a lot of people theorize about democratizing the public square and bringing new voices and sources into conversations about politics and culture			0
it was n't always perfect and it was n't always pretty ( ask @entity192 , the former @entity194 official who sued him for defamation ) , but he blazed a path that surely leads to a far richer and more interesting mediascape than the one we all grew up with .			1

@entity201 says @entity2 , who died , was polarizing -- and liked it
he says @entity2 baited liberals but was not straight - up conservative
he says his legacy was creating *discussion* outlets away from what he saw as smug media
@entity201 : his efforts were n't always pretty , but mediascape he grew was more interesting
