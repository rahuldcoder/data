-- holders @entity1 stayed on course for the domestic double in @entity4 with a 3 - 0 win over @entity6 at @entity7 on saturday to reach the @entity9 final			1
a @entity11 goal midway through the second half and further late strikes from @entity14 and @entity15 secured victory for @entity18 's men in a game of otherwise few chances			2
they will face either @entity22 or now - relegated @entity23 , who play the second semifinal at @entity7 on sunday			2
@entity23 will go into that match as massive underdogs and hardly encouraged by @entity29 's 1 - 0 win over @entity30 in @entity32 action on saturday , which confirms their demotion after a season of financial turmoil			1
whoever reaches next month 's showpiece will face a @entity1 side , who are leading the @entity32 and playing with renewed vigor since their shock @entity43 exit to @entity45			1
it was the 32nd goal of the season in all competitions for @entity49 star @entity11 and one of his most important as he reacted quickly to divert home @entity52 's shot which was going wide			0
@entity52 had been given the chance to shoot after a poor headed clearance from a corner by @entity6 center back @entity57			0
the victory was sealed when substitute @entity59 crossed to the far post for the excellent @entity14 to fire past @entity61 before @entity15 scored a third with one of the final kicks of the match			0
it proved another @entity7 letdown for @entity67 , who were beaten in the @entity69 final by @entity70			0
they started the match the brightest and had strong appeals for a penalty turned down by @entity75 as @entity77 striker @entity76 appeared to be pulled down by @entity78			0
but in the second half @entity1 , who thrashed @entity6 7 - 1 in the @entity32 last month , took command and although the margin of victory was flattering underlined their growing confidence at the business end of the @entity4 season			1
@entity15 , who rounded off the win with his last - minute goal , said their confidence had increased after @entity11 's opener			2
" the double is still on , it 'll be very tough but we want to go all the way , " he told @entity92			0
in the other @entity32 game played on saturday , @entity97 beat fellow strugglers @entity99 4 - 1 to re-energize their survival hopes , but both sides remain in the bottom three after @entity29 's win .			1

@entity1 beat @entity6 3 - 0 to reach final of the @entity104
@entity11 , @entity14 and @entity15 score in second half for @entity108
@entity22 or @entity23 will face them in next month 's final at @entity7
