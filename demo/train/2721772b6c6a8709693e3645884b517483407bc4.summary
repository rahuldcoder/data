@entity0 -- to see @entity2 today is to see how far she has come			1
walking on her new prosthetic leg without crutches is a huge accomplishment , but to see @entity6 ride 26 miles on a hand cycle underscores the tremendous progress she 's made in the five months since the @entity11 bombings			1
" this is the biggest challenge i 've faced since the bombing , " the 31 - year - old @entity13 immigrant said , referring to her participation in a recent ride from @entity16 , @entity17 , to @entity18 in @entity19			0
she beamed as her 5 - year old daughter , @entity23 , and husband , @entity25 , ran to offer hugs and congratulations			0
" it 's great , " @entity25 says proudly			2
" it 's very encouraging to see -- despite what she 's been through			2
" april 15 was the day that profoundly changed @entity2 's life and that of so many others			1
three people were killed and more than 250 were injured when a pair of bombs exploded just seconds apart near the finish line of the @entity11			1
suspect @entity39 was killed four days later in a standoff with police			0
his younger brother , @entity42 , faces charges that could bring a life sentence or the death penalty if he is convicted			2

@entity60 's @entity59 part one : woman gets new leg -- and a new life @entity65 , director of communications , remembers when @entity2 first arrived			1
" it 's amazing to see her first in the hospital bed only a few days after the marathon to now seeing her and others do this [ ride ]			2
" @entity65 arranged for @entity2 and two other bombing victims to participate in a recent challenge for @entity74 , a non-profit organization that provides physical and mental rehabilitation to injured veterans through the sport of cycling			1
for @entity2 , the ride was a way to show solidarity			1
" i think we share a common link in life right now because a lot of them [ veterans ] have injuries that are similar to mine			2
" @entity65 , who rode to the 26 - mile mark with @entity2 , says it was a testament " to the caregivers who helped save their lives and the therapists who brought them along and to most of all them to have the strength to do this			1
" learning to walk ... again @entity2 laughs when you try to call her strong			1
" if it comes out as being strong then that 's what it is but i do n't plan to be strong			2
" at her apartment in @entity0 , she talks about relearning to walk and admits it was a daunting challenge and a lot of hard work			0
@entity2 spent an intensive week of therapy at @entity55 and says there were mornings she did n't even want to get out of bed			1
" it was extremely difficult			0
the whole putting the leg on , i did n't feel like i could do it and you have to wait close to 15 minutes before it adjusts properly			2
it can be painful , " she says , as the lower limb sinks into the prosthesis			0
" you have to overcome the pressure barrier , " but she quickly adds , " i 'm alive and that 's the important thing			2
" @entity2 worked hard ; strengthening her core muscles and weaning herself off crutches			1
her gait is slow and deliberate , but she is walking on her own now and getting stronger every day			0
the difficult , but rewarding , work has inspired @entity2 and she says , " i 'm even thinking about rehabilitation medicine			1
i 'm a patient , too , and i think i can share a lot with patients			0
we have that in common			0
" @entity2 came to the @entity127 with the dream of being a doctor ; she attended medical school abroad and had returned to @entity0 not long before the bombings			1
@entity0 bombing survivor meets woman she says saved her life her plans were interrupted , but @entity2 says she 's still determined to study and pass the exams so she can practice medicine here			1

" i have no doubt she will be great and reach her goals , it will take time , but i know she will do it			0
" for now , @entity2 continues her therapy twice a week and has even renewed an old goal -- to run a marathon			1

" the @entity0 apartment now teeming , @entity2 spends much of her time hunting for a home that is big enough for everyone			1
she 's also looking into schools for her siblings , making sure they have their vaccinations			2
" they 're here and i 'm responsible for them and they look to me			0
so that pushes me to do what needs to be done and that is helping me , too , in a way			0
" do n't call her a victim since the bombings , @entity2 says her insurance has n't put up a fight about paying her medical bills			1
her new leg alone costs $ 50,000			0
but there is worry down the road when adjustments and a new prosthetic become necessary			0
dr. @entity197 , director of @entity55 's amputee program , says , " they [ insurance companies ] will cover a basic cost but they may not cover the full or higher end prosthesis so the patient has to be a good advocate			0
" one fund @entity0 has distributed more than $ 60 million to some 237 victims even as donations continue to come in			0
@entity208 , a website @entity2 's friend set up , has raised some $ 46,200 -- but has hit a plateau , she says			1
the monies are set aside in a trust for @entity60 that will be used for future medical expenses and her overall well - being			0
" i 'm thankful for those who have donated but people move on			0
even us survivors , we do n't stay in the moment , either			0
we move on , " she says			0
" but i do think it 's important for people to be reminded of what happened that day			1
" asked about her reflections on the last five months , @entity2 will tell you she is stronger and that she is no victim			1
" you have to go through certain things in life , certain hurdles to really get to your element -- to find out who you are ... i do n't want to say i 'm glad it happened , but if i could use that to better myself then that 's a good thing			1
now it 's part of me , and so i move on and i 'm learning how to live my life			1
and that to me is -- it 's like i 'm winning			0
