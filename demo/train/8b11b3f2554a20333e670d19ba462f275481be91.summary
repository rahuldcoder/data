@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than a week after @entity5 17 went down in eastern @entity1 , @entity4 investigators have not yet been able to access the entire crash site , @entity4 prime minister @entity7 said saturday			1
he urged both the @entity10 rebels and @entity1 's armed forces to cooperate so investigators can access the site fully			1
all 298 people aboard the plane died when it crashed on july 17			0
of that number , 43 were @entity4 , including 15 crew and two infants , according to @entity5			2
nine days later , some human remains still lie scattered amid the debris			0
a statement from @entity7 's office said that since a deal was struck with the rebels on access to the crash site , a team of three @entity4 investigators has visited on three separate occasions , on tuesday , wednesday and thursday			1
each visit lasted about three hours , and the team was not able to visit all of the very large site			2
the team believes that at least 30 investigators would be needed to cover the entire site , in addition to themselves , three @entity35 investigators and one representative of the independent @entity37 ( @entity37 ) allowed in so far , the statement said			1
" unfortunately , events on the ground -- including ongoing fighting between @entity1 and separatist forces -- prevent such a large contingent of investigators being deployed , " the statement said			1
@entity7 's words come only a day after the rebels controlling the area -- the same rebels that @entity1 and the @entity51 accuse of downing the plane -- hinted to an international monitoring group that they 've nearly had enough , even with the limited number of investigators they 've let in so far			1
" we were given the indication ... that their patience is almost wearing out , " said @entity56 , a spokesman for the @entity57 , which has had a small team touring the site for days			2
" they 're saying maybe another week and then they do n't know what would happen			0
" that scenario would be unlikely to please a number of nations that say a proper investigation still has n't begun , including @entity35 , whose officials say they 're negotiating with the @entity1 government to send 40 @entity35 military police to search for more bodies			1
" @entity4 's agreement with those in control of the crash site has three central elements : the transfer of the black boxes to @entity4 ; the return of the human remains ; and full access to the crash site for international investigators , " @entity7 is quoted as saying			1
" the first two conditions have been met			0
my priority now is to ensure the third part of the deal is honored , and that international investigators are given full and secure access to the site			1
this will require the cooperation of those in control of the crash site and the @entity1 armed forces			1
" more coffins flown out another 38 coffins arrived on two planes from the @entity1 city of @entity103 and were given a somber welcome in the @entity35 city of @entity106			1
this is expected to be the last transfer of coffins from @entity1 to @entity35 for the time being			1
the search for further remains at the crash site will continue when possible			1
meantime , authorities for the first time released the identity of a victim with @entity35 nationality			2
a team of more than 200 specialists are busy with the identification process , but officials have stressed the process could take months			2
a group of @entity35 forensic experts was unable to reach the crash site saturday because of safety concerns prompted by renewed fighting in the @entity0 area , a spokesman for the @entity125 said			1
he said it was also too dangerous for @entity57 observers to return to the site			0
as of friday afternoon , 378 body bags containing remains of flight 17 victims had been processed in @entity103 , where discovered remains have been sent , @entity135 , the head of @entity1 's @entity136 , told reporters there			1
officials say it 's unclear how many individual victims ' remains are contained in the bags			2
@entity35 citizens were 193 of the 298 people aboard the downed flight			0
by friday , 198 coffins had either already arrived in @entity35 or were on their way friday , @entity135 said			2
on friday , the @entity57 team toured the crash site , returning to a recently discovered section of fuselage from the plane			1
this time -- unlike thursday -- victims ' passports and other documentation were there , @entity56 said			0
" we ca n't draw any conclusions			0
but for sure , those were not there the last time we were there , " he said			0
" perhaps someone placed it there			0
" no @entity1 government or international force has secured the site , raising concerns about tampering or pilfering			2
the @entity57 team on friday toured with a few experts from @entity178 and , for the first time , some forensic experts from @entity35			2
though many corpses have been recovered already , @entity56 said the group still has seen human remains among the debris several times this week			0
@entity184 to vote on international police @entity1 temporary acting prime minister @entity186 said saturday that access to the crash site to allow its examination by investigators and the recovery of bodies is the key issue at stake , according to the @entity196 press office			1
but , he said , an international police mission is needed to guard the experts on the site			0
for this to happen , he said , @entity184 must ratify a treaty allowing the deployment			0
" this document is being prepared and will soon be introduced to the @entity184			0
i hope it will be passed by the @entity184 next week , " he said			0
the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for thursday			0
it would appear that no international police will be allowed at the site before @entity184 votes			0
forty @entity35 military policemen have arrived in @entity1 , where they will be tasked with helping to find human remains and belongings			1
they have not yet gone to the crash site			1
@entity7 is expected to travel to @entity35 on wednesday and will meet with @entity35 prime minister @entity217 in the @entity218 , his office said			0
the two leaders will discuss issues around securing the crash site and the process of identifying the human remains recovered from the scene so far			1
@entity7 said the three @entity4 investigators were now preparing a preliminary report based on their observations so far			1
once that is complete , they plan to return to the crash site , " if possible with a larger contingent of investigators and in more secure circumstances , " the statement said			1
conflict continues accusations over who was responsible for bringing down the passenger jet , which was headed from @entity239 to @entity4 , continue to be traded by the @entity1 government , @entity242 rebels and officials in @entity244 and @entity245			1
@entity246 was downed on july 17 by a suspected surface - to - air missile over eastern @entity1 , where groups of @entity242 rebels are fighting @entity1 government forces			2
the rebels have denied allegations from @entity1 and the @entity253 that they brought down the commercial airliner using equipment supplied by @entity256			0
conflict continues to roil the @entity0 and @entity259 regions of eastern @entity1			0
hundreds of vehicles crawled in heavy traffic saturday as residents attempt to flee the center of @entity264 heading south , following a night of intensified shelling and anti-aircraft fire on the northern outskirts of what is a stronghold for the @entity10 rebels			0
according to the @entity273 feed for the press office of the self - declared @entity275 on saturday , fighting has occurred at five border check points that appear to be on the @entity256 side of the @entity1 - @entity256 border			2
@entity256 's state - run @entity280 news agency also reported fighting at five border checkpoints , naming three places on the @entity256 side of the border , @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287			0
