" for that reason , i ask that the league clarify its position by issuing a public statement that any form of discrimination or harassment on the basis of sexual orientation by league teams or their employees or agents against potential recruits or players constitutes a violation of state , local and , in some cases , contractual law , and will not be tolerated			1
