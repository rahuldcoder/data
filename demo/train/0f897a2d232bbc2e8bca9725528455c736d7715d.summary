@entity12 , a longtime activist and a founder of the @entity14 , is accused of " inciting subversion of state power , " the group @entity11 said			1
@entity12 is at least the fourth activist reported to be arrested and accused of that crime in recent weeks			1
@entity18 said @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 were formally arrested between march 25 and march 28 " and could face lengthy prison terms			2
" " since an anonymous online call on 17 february to stage a ' @entity8 ' in @entity3 more than a hundred activists , many of them active on @entity26 and blogs , have been detained , put under surveillance or illegal house arrest , or have simply gone missing , " @entity18 said in a report this week			1
" moreover , at least a dozen lawyers say they have been briefly detained and pressured by the authorities not to take up cases defending those detained , and even told by police to stop tweeting about the detained people			0
" @entity1 's call to @entity3 's @entity37 on wednesday evening was not immediately returned			1
" @entity3 is a country ruled by law , and @entity3 citizens are supposed to conduct their businesses within the framework of @entity3 's constitution and laws , " much like the @entity44 , @entity45 , spokesman for the @entity46 in @entity47 , wrote in an e-mail			1
. " no one is allowed to enjoy privileged rights above the law , no matter who you are and what high positions you hold			0
" in recent years , he said , about a dozen high - ranking @entity3 government officials per year have been prosecuted and punished " because of their unlawful activities such as corruption and election manipulations , which rarely catches the attention of the @entity44 media			2
we hope that the @entity64 media will take an objective and fair attitude toward @entity3 's human rights situation , which has been constantly improving			1
" last week , @entity3 denied reports that a dissident artist was being held due to his calls for reform			2
the government insisted that @entity73 was being investigated for economic crimes			0
" it has nothing to do with human rights or freedom of expression , " ministry spokesman @entity75 told reporters during a regular weekly briefing			1
@entity82 , @entity73 's mother , told @entity1 that she is very worried			0
" there is nowhere i can ask about his whereabouts , " she said			0
" i would sell my house ( for the money ) to go to court if necessary ... i will go to the prison with him			0
i would die there with him			0
" if this is an economic crime case , why did it need so many policemen ? " she asked			0
" why did they raid his studio , why everyone is now under close supervision ? is it worthwhile ? this is very stupid			0
" @entity73 , one of the country 's best - known artists , helped design the @entity105 for the @entity106 , but he later called for a boycott of the 2008 games because , he said , @entity3 was using them as propaganda			2
he has also accused the @entity3 government of trying to silence dissidents			2

@entity11 also said @entity0 - based housing rights activist @entity122 and her husband @entity124 , missing since april 7 , had been detained			2
the @entity125 on @entity3 for 2010 , published last week , says , " a negative trend in key areas of the country 's human rights record continued , as the government took additional steps to rein in civil society , particularly organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest issues , and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and to control the press , the @entity141 and internet access			1
" efforts to silence political activists and public interest lawyers were stepped up , and increasingly the government resorted to extralegal measures including enforced disappearance , ' soft detention , ' and strict house arrest , including house arrest of family members , to prevent the public voicing of independent opinions			0
public interest law firms that took on sensitive cases also continued to face harassment , disbarment of legal staff , and closure			0
" during a visit to @entity47 in january			0
@entity3 president @entity160 acknowledged that " a lot still needs to be done " about human rights in his country			1
