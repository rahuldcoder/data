-- connectivity was the name of the game at this year 's @entity4 , held last week in @entity5 -- especially when it came to health - related products			1
from cloud - connected scales to music - connected sex toys , these gadgets rose above the rest as those that might really help you keep your @entity15 's resolutions			1
sleep soundly a small , lightweight band users wear on their heads during sleep , the @entity16 measures brain waves while you 're in dreamland , and will sync via @entity23 with your smart device			1
@entity16 's free app plots out how many hours of quality snooze time you 're getting each night			1
great feedback for our highly caffeinated , tech - obsessed society , it also plots out sleep quality based on behaviors you input			1
how much did those three glasses of vino affect your sleep ? how about that late night fast - food run , or actual run ? @entity16 gives you concrete tips for improving your sleep routine based on your habits , and will even wake you up at the optimum time in your sleep cycle			1
the @entity16 is available for a one - time purchase price of $ 99			1
( no monthly subscription required			2
) body bands a bevy of body bands made a splash at @entity4 this year , among them the @entity51 and the @entity50			2
@entity51 's @entity51 monitoring system consists of a small electric band the user wears on his or her arm , that works in conjunction with a software interface that 's available on your smartphone or online			2
users input their daily calorie intake , and the device monitors calories burned			2
the band uses sweat sensors , an accelerometer and skin temperature monitors to figure out how much exercise you 're doing , and for how long			2
it compares that to your food intake to give a picture of your daily health			2
the accelerometer knows when you 're lying on your back for hours at a time ( presumably sleeping ) , and adds that to your fitness picture as well			0
the @entity80 is available for $ 149 , but requires plugging in to synch your data			0
the new fit link is @entity23 - enabled for wireless synching , and is available for $ 179			1
both products require a $ 6.95 monthly subscription to @entity51 's online dashboard			0
similar to the @entity87 , the @entity50 adds real - time heart rate monitoring to the mix by using a optical engine that " looks through the skin to see actual blood flow , " similar to the technology used in pulse oximeters ( those little things they put on your finger at the doctor 's office			1
) the @entity50 is also worn on the wrist rather than on the arm , and looks more like a trendy watch than a fitness monitor			0
the basis is available for pre-order , shipping sometime this quarter ; and will be $ 199			0
the price includes lifetime access to the cloud service and online interface -- no monthly subscription required			0
smart medical devices smart medical devices abounded on the expo floor this year			0
the @entity113 , a sleek device that looks like an @entity114 you can step on , connects with your @entity114 , or other @entity117 or @entity119 - capable phone			1
the scale measures your weight , lean and fat mass and calculates your @entity123 almost instantaneously			0
to keep things simple ( and less depressing ) , the display only shows your weight -- the rest of the information floats up to the cloud , and is available on your smartphone			0
the free app interface also lets you invite friends , family members or your doctor to view your progress ; and it will keep track of data for up to eight users			1
the @entity139 is available for $ 159 , which includes lifetime access to the web and phone service			1
unfortunately , just because this scale is cloud - connected , does n't mean you 're going to be any lighter			1
@entity145 also had another smart medical device : the @entity146			0
wrap it around your arm and then plug this bad boy into your @entity114 , @entity150 or @entity151			1
a small compressor in the device inflates the cuff , using power from your device			0
once the reading is complete , the information is logged in a free app , and is available to send to your doctor for analysis and tracking			1
the cuff is available for $ 129 with no recurring monthly fees			0
@entity165 - based @entity164 also brought a @entity167 scale and blood pressure cuff to the table ; but a third product really caught our attention : the @entity173			1
as more of the connected generation starts dealing with diabetes , this high - tech tool may encourage diabetics to check their blood sugar more often			1
the device is simple : plug a pack - of - gum - sized accessory into the bottom of your @entity183 device , insert a test strip , prick your finger ( unfortunately , they have n't been able to eliminate that step )			1
put a drop of blood on the strip			0
within a few seconds , the device measures your blood sugar , and catalogs it for you and your doctor to track			0
the @entity173 is pending approval with the @entity195 , and should be available in the latter half of 2012			0
the price has not yet been set			0
health apps just as cool as some of the hardware at @entity4 was the software			0
" @entity207 " of health was a popular phrase on the show floor , and several companies weighed in with entries to that category			0
among the coolest were ... @entity210 's @entity209 is a social fitness app that lets you challenge friends and family to get healthy			1
the app allows users to make their own health challenges or select from a list of popular challenges			1
among them : competitions to see who can walk the most steps in a day , who can be the first to run 100 miles , and who can eat their daily servings of fruits and veggies			0
the app allows you to add a prize for the top dog and share your results on social networking sites with friends			1
@entity209 is a free app , and it allows you to sync fitness information with your employer 's benefits plan if your company has @entity210 coverage			1
( @entity241 , @entity0 's parent company , is a member of @entity210 insurance coverage			0
) this app is n't a new entry into the category , but a much improved one			1
lose it ! is a weight - loss management tool that allows users to keep track of food and exercise on the go			1
the app has a catalog of thousands of the most popular foods , and all of the nutrition information for each of them			1
popular new additions to the app include bar - code scanning of your favorite prepackaged food items , the ability to create and share custom foods and recipes with your friends , and a @entity270 - like badge - earning system , that rewards users ' daily entries , weight loss milestones , and sharing activities			1
lose it ! is a free app , and will integrate data from many of the connected medical devices listed above into your health picture			2
the cool stuff there are a few other notable additions to the list , though they only sort of qualify as health devices			0
the @entity287 is so cool , it might make you want a baby ! this " iphone of baby strollers " both collapses and rebuilds itself at the touch of a button , using on - board motors that are charged when the user pushes the stroller			2
it also features daytime - running lights , a cupholder , and a smartphone - charging pouch ( using the same charge - as - you - push technology )			2
an onboard lcd screen monitors the weather , battery level and whether or not your child is in the seat -- critical info if you 're considering pushing the " fold " button			0
but rest assured , the device is n't as scatter - brained as new moms tend to be , and wo n't fold if your bambino is inside			2
the origami is available for $ 849			0
the @entity318 gives some much needed love to the oft - neglected category of home heating and cooling interfaces			2
this $ 249 piece of wall art automatically learns your temperature preferences , and your comings and goings to make sure your house is cool when you want it to be			0
users can also control the @entity167 connected device remotely via smartphone ; and special plastic technology enables it to pick up the color of the wall it 's on to blend in with your decor			0
and for those of you whose @entity15 's resolutions included having more , uh , fun in the bedroom , the @entity341 musical vibrators use an audio - enabled microchips to vibrate to the beat of your favorite music			2
the line features personal - use and partner - friendly devices ; even a wearable model to take with you to the clubs			2
this product was a little difficult to test on the show floor , though .			0
