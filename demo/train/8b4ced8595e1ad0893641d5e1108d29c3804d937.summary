" there were pools of blood everywhere			0
i have never seen such mass killing			0
" " they were innocent poor mothers or sisters , " @entity20 said			0
" why did they deserve this ? " it is unclear who is behind the attack			0
@entity0 mayor @entity39 , who was recently fired by the country 's prime minister , blamed the @entity42 for waging the attack			1
but the head of the @entity46 insurgent group , @entity47 , denied any involvement and blamed @entity1 's government for orchestrating the attack			1

@entity1 's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital , with the help of the better - equipped @entity63 forces			1
on saturday , two - thirds of the @entity1 government ministers announced their resignations , blaming prime minister @entity74 's " dictatorship , " which they said included his firing of @entity0 's mayor			1
