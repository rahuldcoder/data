playing the lottery has always been something fun to do for retiree @entity3			1
so when the @entity7 native went to a gas station to purchase his weekly @entity10 ticket , on one particular saturday in december , he sprung for a scratch - off ticket , too			1
" you only live once , right ? " he said			2
the winning numbers printed at the top of the scratch - off were two and one			1
@entity16 said he was in shock when he scratched off five of them , his winnings totaling more than $ 500,000			1
the amount confused him , he said , because the maximum prize on the ticket is $ 250,000			1
still , he said , he " thought [ he ] won big ! " but when he took the ticket to the store where he bought it , the store clerk put the ticket in a scanner that said @entity28 was n't a winner after all			2
@entity28 called the @entity30 , which confirmed the ticket was a misprint			0
wines ' fun hobby had now become the cause of an emotional roller coaster			0
he reached out to the @entity30 , hoping it might honor the ticket			0
but it only thanked him for calling to attention the misprint and offered him $ 100 in lottery bucks			1
@entity16 said it felt like a " brick to the head			0
" " that 's a far cry from $ 500,000 , do n't you think ? " he said			2
@entity16 said the money is important to him , but " it 's the principle of the thing , " that bothers him most			0
" i 'm an honest person , " he said , " it 's just not right			0

@entity7 *man* thought he scratched off five winning numbers
lottery *commission* offers him $ 100 in lottery bucks
