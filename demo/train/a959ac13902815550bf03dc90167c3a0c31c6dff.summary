-- @entity1 , ceo of @entity2 , was watching the @entity3 with his daughter when she saw it -- an ad featuring a man in a wheelchair suffering from a severe brain injury and holding a sign with the text : " where r. " " this is the text message that caused the car accident that changed my life forever , " the man said			1
according to @entity1 , the ad did its job			2
" she said , ' @entity20 ... that 's heavy ' , " he said			0
" i said , it 's supposed to be heavy			0
it got your attention and that 's what we 're trying to accomplish			0
" @entity28 teen convicted of homicide in texting - while - driving case the ad , from @entity2 , is part of the mobile company 's " it can wait " campaign			1
first launched in 2009 , the campaign aims to curb texting and driving , especially among young drivers			1
it will be ramping up between now and september 19 , or what the campaign is calling " @entity41 -- @entity42			1
" @entity2 is asking all @entity43 to visit @entity44 on or before that day and take a pledge to not text behind the wheel			1
according to the @entity47 , texting while driving increased 50 % in one year ( 2010 ) , when 20 % of all drivers admitted to texting or sending an e-mail while driving			1
teens report doing so at more than twice that rate , with 43 % admitting to doing so in an @entity2 survey			1
people texting are 23 times more likely to get into an accident than other drivers , according to the @entity56			2
several @entity2 competitors , including @entity58 and @entity59 , have their own anti-texting - and - driving campaigns in one form or another , a fact @entity1 said he welcomes			1
" if it 's just @entity2 owning this issue , it does n't get the traction it needs , " he said			2
" this is a dead - serious issue and i do n't mean that as a pun			0
people are dying ... we just need everyone to get after this and reverse this trend			0
" but with the ads like the one @entity1 watched with his daughter , @entity2 's campaign has been most visible			1
@entity1 makes no apologies about the frank nature of the ads , another of which features a woman sharing the one - word text she 'd sent to her sister , who was reading it behind the wheel when she flipped her car and died			2
" i do n't think you 're going to move the needle without making people uncomfortable , " he said			0
texting while walking a dangerous experiment in multitasking others supporting the campaign include the @entity97 , @entity98 , wireless - industry trade association @entity99 and the @entity43 @entity100			2
as to the pledge , @entity1 acknowledges that such efforts can be spotty in terms of verifiable results			0
but anything that draws attention to the problem is a plus , he said			0
" we 've all made these pledges , and some stick and some do n't , " said @entity1			0
" but just the act , the effort of going to a website and taking the pledge ... now you 're aware			0
