@entity0 and @entity1 were craftsmen by trade when they decided to turn their hobby making custom knives into a sharp business idea			1
the @entity8 - based buddies , who worked in the construction industry and shared a love for hunting and crafting , attended their first knife show together in 2007			2
the duo was so intrigued that they bought knife blades and products from the grocery store to craft their own knives -- all for $ 20 or less -- as a hobby			0
" we went from a hobby standpoint and we were inspired by the knife makers , " @entity1 says			1
proud of their creations , the friends met one afternoon to discuss going into the knife - making business together to fulfill their shared dream of becoming entrepreneurs			2
over coffee , @entity0 told @entity1 the story of his great - great - uncle , who built a shack behind his home in @entity34 with the help of a blind horse and few tools			1
" the name of the company and a business model were created before a knife for distribution was even made , " @entity1 said			1
the legacy of a blind horse , a vision and hard work have led @entity48 and @entity0 to craft their own version of the @entity51 dream			1
devoted to turning their hobby into a small business , the pair quit their jobs and set up shop in the basement of their homes			2
financially , both men agree that it was a struggle in the beginning			0
the duo financed their small business using their own savings			0
" we never borrowed money , " @entity1 says			2
" we were making a fair living before , " @entity0 says			1
but after quitting their jobs and creating a business , " we could n't afford a paycheck			0
" there were many nights when he second - guessed his decision to start his own business , @entity0 says			1
the will came from wanting to provide jobs for local craftsmen and family , and his passion for people and knives			1
the two crafted knives by hand through sleepless nights in their basements and drive an hour and a half every day to meet and exchange products to distribute			0
with several knives and nowhere to sell them , the pair attended a gun show where they met arrowhead maker @entity95 , who began to mentor the men , teaching them about handcrafting and inviting them to shows to sell their products at his station			0
finally feeling comfortable with the knives they produced , the two committed @entity38 to the cutlery show @entity104 , where they received positive feedback and began taking orders			2
as the business began to grow , their wives got onboard with @entity38 with part - time jobs			1
@entity0 's daughter and son - in - law joined the team shortly after			1
they branded themselves through social media , gun and knife shows , and word of mouth			0
instead of focusing on hard times and financial difficulty , the men saw the bigger picture			0
asked if they were happy with the results , @entity1 says the business is a blessing			1
" if you have faith and believe , anything can happen			0
" much has happened for @entity38			2
as of 2013 , the collaborators have their own publication , @entity132 , host @entity133 ( a weekend show ) and own the first knife show they ever attended			0
since it began , @entity38 has grossed more than $ 1 million and put 23 local craftsmen to work making 250 knives a week that have been delivered around the world , say @entity1 and @entity0			1
their success is measured by customer satisfaction and the personal relationship fostered through every purchase			0
" it 's the drive , " @entity0 says , " we develop a customer and a friend for life by always pushing to be the best			1
" " @entity150 is having a house , car and family , but life has its ups and downs			0
the journey is what got us here			0
believe in yourself and learn from the mistakes			0
bad situations lead to good opportunities , " @entity0 says .			2
