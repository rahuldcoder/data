the engineer who was involved in sunday 's @entity9 train derailment apparently " was nodding off and caught himself too late " before the accident that killed four people and injured 67 others , a union representative who has been meeting with the man told @entity0 on tuesday			1
@entity10 , the union representative , said engineer @entity11 recognizes his responsibility in the incident			1
" i think most people are leaning towards human error , " @entity10 said			1
@entity11 's lawyer , @entity16 , characterized what happened as " highway hypnosis			1
" he said his client had had a full night 's sleep before the crash , and that @entity11 had no disciplinary record			1
in a brief conversation with investigators , @entity11 said that moments before the derailment of the @entity29 train in the @entity30 he was " going along and i 'm in a daze			2
i do n't know what happened , " according to a law enforcement official familiar with that conversation			1
asked by investigators what he was thinking when he said he was dazed , the engineer said he could n't say			1
@entity11 spoke to @entity37 and @entity9 police detectives at the crash site before he was taken to the hospital sunday			1
@entity42 member @entity41 told a news conference that @entity11 would have had a chance to get the necessary sleep prior to his 5 a.m. shift the day of sunday 's accident , echoing comment from @entity11 's lawyer			1
according to @entity42 representatives , results from alcohol breath tests for the train engineer were negative , and both the brake and signal systems in the deadly @entity56 accident appeared to be working			1
other toxicology results have not yet come back			0
fatigue is a factor being investigated , according to a separate @entity9 law enforcement source			1
but @entity11 also told investigators on site that the brakes had failed , as @entity0 reported previously			0
officials noted the train had been able to stop nine times at stations ahead of the crash			1
@entity41 told reporters that the train was equipped with a " dead man 's pedal , " designed to stop the train if the engineer becomes incapacitated			1
but it was unclear whether that emergency system was activated			0
" we do n't know what that sequence was at this point , " @entity41 said			0
" it 's too early to comment on that			1
but yes , there was a dead man 's pedal			1
" late tuesday , the @entity42 said the rail union has been kicked out of its investigation of the derailment for violating confidentiality rules			1
the agency specifically cited @entity10 's comments as a violation			1
additional safety system urged for years railroad safety officials have long pushed for a system known as positive train control technology , which combines gps , wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding or derailing			0
but the railroad industry has opposed the technology because of the high cost			0
@entity102 , a @entity103 professor and expert on railway operations , said the transportation safety board has urged railroads to install @entity108 in some form since 1970			0
in 2008 , @entity110 ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by december 2015			1
" @entity108 would have sounded an alarm as soon as the train exceeded the speed limit , " said @entity102			0
but there will be some other thing in the future , other ways that somebody will find to defeat the system or screw up			0
" on tuesday , @entity41 said it 's possible that @entity108 could have prevented a derailment involving a high - speed train such as the @entity56 accident			1
" what i can say is that for more than 20 years the @entity42 has recommended the implementation of @entity108 technology , " @entity41 said			1
" these systems provide a safety redundancy by slowing or stopping the train that is n't being operated in accordance to signals , speed limits or other operating rules			1
@entity108 is proven technology that can prevent train - to - train collisions , over speed derailments and incursions into work zones			0
" @entity142 , a spokesman for the @entity37 said the agency began work to install @entity108 on the @entity145 and @entity56 in 2009 , budgeting nearly $ 600 million for @entity108 installation , including $ 428 million last month for a system integrator			0
full implementation is estimated at $ 900 million			0
but , @entity149 said in a statement , implementing @entity108 by the 2015 deadline will difficult because much of the technology is still under development , untested and unproven on commuter railroads the size of @entity56 and @entity145			0
" the @entity37 will continue its efforts to install @entity108 as quickly as possible and will continue to make all prudent and necessary investments to keep its network safe , " @entity142 said			0
the locomotive and all seven coaches jumped the tracks while barreling into a curve at 82 mph , nearly three times the 30 - mph limit for the curve , according to the @entity42			1
expert : " twilight " common among train crews @entity102 said the early hour of the derailment , along with the decreased rail traffic on the @entity171 weekend , also could have played a role in @entity11 's " daze			1
" @entity102 called it a " twilight " of inattention or distraction common in transport crews on late - night and early - morning shifts			0
" if he was dead , dead asleep , his hands would have come off the controls and ... some of the ' dead man ' stuff would have come into play , " said @entity102 , referring to " dead man " mechanisms that automatically stop trains when the engineer is incapacitated			1
" but if it was kind of that twilight where you 're just there and still kind of gently holding onto to things but not quite really aware , which in my mind is still sleeping			0
" in the culture of railroad workers , @entity102 said , admitting to falling asleep at the controls is almost as bad as admitting to being drunk or on drugs			0
" it 's very realistic that he , in fact , really did fall asleep , " he said			2
" falling asleep at the controls of a locomotive is a horrible evil			0
you 're not supposed to do that			0
he really does n't want to come out and say , ' i fell asleep			0
' it 's emotionally embarrassing			2
it 's not just a rules violation			1
there 's a psychological component			2
if you come out and say , ' i fell asleep , ' it 's just purely beyond embarrassing			2
it 's a violation of the sacred understanding of what a train crew should do			2
" @entity11 is not working or getting paid , according to @entity224 , @entity37 spokeswoman			0
" he is out of service			0
this is an unpaid status , " said @entity224 , adding that @entity11 is presumed innocent until disciplinary procedures are completed			0
@entity42 officials would not comment on @entity11 's reported comments , but they have said fatigue is routinely investigated as a possible cause in such cases			1
" we do n't have the work history at the moment , " @entity41 told @entity233 monday on @entity0 's @entity234			2
" we will be developing what we call a 72 - hour timeline , so that we have a good understanding of what sort of activities preceded this accident			0
that 's part of our normal investigation			1
" @entity102 said the rail and signal hardware date to @entity249 and , if @entity11 was dazed or momentarily distracted , there was no system in place to alert him that he was traveling at 82 mph			2
" it 's a perfect - storm kind of thing , " he said			2
" you can look back in the history books of railroad accidents and there are plenty more where this came from			0
events and things that happen that in and of themselves are not supposed to be bad but they turn into bad things			0
" engineer cooperating with authorities the train was about 10 miles short of its destination , @entity271 's @entity270 , when it derailed on the approach to the @entity274 station in the @entity30			1
the @entity42 's interview monday with @entity11 was cut short because of his emotional state , @entity41 told @entity0			1
the interview resumed tuesday and was expected to continue wednesday			0
" i think it was basically emotional issues with the engineer , " @entity41 said			2
the crash , which took four lives , was " a very traumatic experience for him			2
" @entity41 said @entity11 was cooperative but was " not up to it			0
" @entity42 officials said it is not unusual for those who have survived fatal accidents to be emotional during interviews			1
nor is it unusual for the board to allow participants additional time to complete the interview			0
@entity293 said @entity11 is cooperating			0
" there 's a lot of quotes coming from him , but when you 're in a crash like this , anything you say in the beginning has to be taken with a grain of salt , " @entity293 said			1
" @entity303 is very distraught			0
i 've been with him , and he really has n't had a lot of sleep and he 's just crushed by everything			2
i know how sincere he is and he 'll be very forthcoming very shortly			0
" " @entity308 is fully cooperating with the @entity42 , " @entity293 added			1
" he needed to get some rest			0
he 's very traumatized by the loss of life			2
it 's best that it comes from him what happened			1
he 's a quality human being			1
i 've been a conductor and representative , and i 'd be proud to have him as my engineer			1
" @entity293 said @entity11 started out as a janitor at @entity270 and " worked his way up			0
" " he 's been in operations for quite a while , " he said			2
" he used to change the time of the trains in @entity270			0
he 's just a guy who 's always gone out of his way for everyone else			2
it brings me to tears because the loss of life is something that -- it 's the hardest thing to deal with			2
when you lose life it 's difficult for all			2
" said @entity102 : " this engineer , i 'm sure , as the evidence comes out , i think we 're really looking at a sad , really basic kind of inattentiveness			2
nothing fancy : no alcohol , no drugs , maybe not even a cell phone			0
