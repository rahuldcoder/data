@entity0 , @entity1 -- the last place @entity4 could have ever imagined she 'd spend the first night of the @entity5 in @entity0 , @entity1 , was at a happy hour sponsored by the @entity7			1
@entity9 supporters chat at the @entity10 sponsored @entity11 monday night in @entity0 , @entity1			1
but the 54 - year - old @entity12 joined several other @entity14 supporters , along with volunteers and officials from @entity18 's campaign , at a @entity11 for @entity14			1
the event , sponsored by the @entity20 and approved by the @entity18 campaign , was a chance for @entity18 and @entity9 supporters to come together for one cause : their opposition to @entity27 's candidacy			1
" four years ago , if you said we 'd be at a @entity14 happy hour at the @entity5 , i would have called you crazy			1
but today is a great opportunity for people who ... agree that sen. @entity27 does n't have the experience to be president of the @entity37 , " said @entity18 campaign regional communications director @entity32			1
as @entity39 was delivering her " @entity41 " unity speech on the convention floor several blocks away , more than 100 people gathered at the @entity44 in downtown @entity0			2
in a side room , both groups of supporters discussed politics , sports and the convention while sipping cocktails and munching on tacos and a cheese spread			0
but there was nothing unified for these @entity9 supporters who walked across the aisle or , in this case , the cafe monday night			2
@entity4 , who hails from @entity0 , has been a registered @entity12 all her life -- until now			2
" i 'm a registered @entity7 ... for the first time in my voting life , " @entity4 said			2
" no @entity27 for me			0
i 'm voting for @entity18			0
" " he reminds me of what the @entity63 era was like			0
... if they think @entity63 had it bad , just wait if @entity27 gets into the @entity67			0
that will be bad news in so many ways , " she added			0
@entity27 's relative lack of experience in national politics -- long seen as his achilles heel -- was something that @entity9 supporters , @entity7 and independents attending the happy hour rallied behind			1
" his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about			0
... you can not have good judgment without experience ; that 's how you get it , " said 58 - year - old @entity83 of @entity84			1
@entity89 , a 20 - year - old @entity9 supporter , said that although the @entity84 senator " was the stronger candidate , " voters may have " just discredited her because of some imagined baggage she carried from her husband 's administration			1
" @entity98 , a @entity18 supporter who made his way to @entity0 from @entity100 , @entity101 , said @entity27 's message of ' change ' is simply flawed			1
" the simple fact remains , change will occur anyway , no matter who the president is			0
for every man , woman and child , change will happen			0
question is : who is best able to handle that change ? " the 51 - year - old @entity7 said			2
the @entity18 campaign has been aggressively courting @entity9 's voters in recent days , especially after @entity27 announced @entity118 sen. @entity117 as his running mate saturday			1
shortly after the announcement , the @entity122 senator 's campaign released a tv ad in several swing states that used video of @entity117 criticizing @entity27 as too inexperienced to be president			1
and just as the @entity129 ' convention was getting started in @entity0 , both the @entity18 campaign and the @entity20 unveiled four tv ads geared toward @entity9 supporters			1
the most recent @entity18 ad involves the famous @entity14 " 3 a.m. " spot and will be aired during the convention			2
the 30 - second spot uses footage from @entity9 's original ad and declares , " @entity14 's right			1
" the ad , set to run in key battleground states and specifically in @entity0 this week , also goes a step further than the @entity84 senator 's original ad , explicitly detailing the national security threats @entity37 faces			1
@entity9 , speaking to member of the @entity84 delegation in @entity0 on monday , said she was opposed to republicans using her words against @entity27			1
meanwhile , a @entity2 / @entity151 poll taken august 23 - 24 found that 56 percent of registered voters have a favorable opinion of @entity14 , with 40 percent having an unfavorable view			2
the margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points			0
ireport.com : are you in @entity0 ? so while @entity9 's die - hard supporters are in @entity0 in full force , the poll showed that her negative approval rating is very high among registered voters nationwide			1
but there is some bad news for @entity27			0
the poll showed that 66 percent of @entity9 supporters -- registered @entity129 who want @entity9 as the nominee -- are now backing @entity27			1
that 's down from 75 percent in the end of june			0
twenty - seven percent of them now say they 'll support @entity18 , up from 16 percent in late june			2
and nowhere was that statistic more prevalent than at the @entity10 - sponsored happy hour for @entity14			1
@entity9 supporters - turned - @entity18 converts at the event were not just angry at @entity27 's campaign ; they 're furious with the @entity129 's nomination process this year			1
" the @entity5 really pushed [ @entity27 ] on us			0
now they 've left us with two choices : somebody who has no substance or a @entity7 , " said @entity181 , 35 , of @entity84			2
" and these are terrible choices , and they worked hard to select this candidate			0
... we 're watching the @entity5 pick this candidate for us			0
" it 's a point @entity190 agreed with			0
" we 're taking a stand and not backing down			0
it 's ' we the people , ' not ' we the @entity5			0
' we are standing up for what is right			0
i know in my heart , " said the woman from @entity196 , @entity197 , who would give her age only as 50 - something			0
as the convention heats up and tensions remain high over how to make sure @entity9 's 18 million or so votes are counted , supporters will rally by her side , even if their pick in november is her enemy .			2

the @entity7 held a happy hour for @entity14 backers in @entity0
some @entity9 backers say @entity27 lacks experience necessary to be president
only two - thirds of the @entity84 senator 's supporters are backing @entity27 , poll finds
@entity18 's campaign has been actively courting @entity9 backers
