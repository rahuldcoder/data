-- think you use your phone to look at @entity3 a lot ? unless you 're doing it at least 14 times a day , you 're actually below average			1
that 's just one of the surprising revelations in a research report by @entity12 released wednesday			0
the study tapped 7,446 @entity15 and @entity16 users in the @entity17 between 18 and 44 — representative of the 50 % of the population that uses smartphones — and asked them questions about their phone usage across one week in march			1
depending on your perspective , many of the results are either depressing or confirm what you knew all along			0
for example , it seems that 79 % of smartphone users reach for their devices within 15 minutes of waking up			2
a clear majority — 62 % — do n't even wait 15 minutes , and grab their phones immediately			0
( among 18 - to 24 - year - olds , the numbers rise to 89 % and 74 %			0
) given that the survey was sponsored by @entity3 , most of the questions focus on the social network			1
which is , it seems , only the third most popular app on your smartphone , after email and the browser			0
still , 70 % of smartphone users are frequent @entity3 visitors , with more than half of them checking it every day			1
@entity3 time is during the evening , just before bed			2
but any time 's good : on average , we visit the @entity3 app or the site 13.8 times during the day , for two minutes and 22 seconds each time			1
our average total daily mobile time on the site — and remember , this is just via our smartphones — is half an hour			2
that 's roughly a fifth of all the time we spend communicating ; it 's only slightly less time than we spend texting			0
on weekends , we check @entity3 more than we text			1
any place seems to be good to check @entity3 , too			1
some 46 % of us check it when we 're shopping or running errands ; 48 % use it at the gym			2
even preparing a meal gives 47 % of us no respite from the social network			0
( well , what else are you going to do while you 're waiting for the microwave to ping ? ) perhaps the most unpardonable sin : 50 % of smartphone users admit to checking @entity3 while at a movie			1
we hope they mean only during the ads. so what are we spending all that time doing ? well , for about half of that daily half - hour on the social network , we 're simply browsing our @entity87			0
the rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between @entity3 messaging and posting updates			0
half of @entity3 users play games via the service on their phone a few times a day			1
does the smartphone survey ring true to you ? share your thoughts in the comments			0
