" senator @entity74 , chairman of the @entity75 , said wednesday that , while @entity1 are not asking for foreign troops on the ground , they need " the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on @entity1 streets , and i believe that the global community can not be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe			1
a no - fly zone is not a long - term proposition , assuming the outcome is what all desire , and i believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary			0

@entity261 , the leader 's 38 - year - old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told @entity2 tuesday that his talks with the opposition were in " chaos " because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders			2
@entity67 officials made similar comments about the opposition			0
a @entity67 official who wanted to remain anonymous because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it is " unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult " for the @entity67 to provide assistance			0
