-- the author @entity1 caused a stir last week with reports about his finding of @entity6 recordings of president @entity7 making telephone calls to foreign leaders			1
the president made these recordings , according to @entity1 , to make sure the historical record was accurate			2
the conversations are fascinating to hear			2
in one , @entity7 is desperate to apologize to @entity15 prime minister @entity14 for not having informed her about the @entity17 invasion of @entity18 in 1983			1
" i 'm sorry for any embarrassment we caused you , " @entity7 says			1
he explains to her that it was nothing personal , but rather a result of his own frustration with the inability to keep secrets in the @entity17 political system			0
in another tape , we can hear president @entity7 trying to persuade @entity34 prime minister @entity33 to wait on pulling out his military forces from @entity36 until @entity36 troops can be brought in			1
in a third tape , we hear @entity40 president @entity39 angrily waiting for @entity7 , who keeps him on hold as he is finishing a horseback ride			1
the translator simply tells @entity39 that the president is on the " farm			2
" the recordings have caught most people by surprise			0
until now most experts thought the last private presidential audio we would hear was of president @entity52 , whose infamous recordings became part of the @entity55 that resulted in his resignation in 1974			1
the @entity58 tape recordings of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity52 have offered some of the most riveting and revealing looks that we have into the private world of @entity17 politics , where negotiations , confrontations and deliberation have been conducted in closed rooms , outside the public purview			1
the tapes provided an unequaled glimpse into the workings of @entity17 political power			2
one of the great tragedies of @entity55 for historians and for the public was that because the tapes became part of the evidence that brought down @entity52 , presidents were thought to have stopped compiling such historical treasure			1
six presidents secretly recorded meetings and telephone conversations between 1940 and 1973			1
they all had different systems			0
different presidents used the recording system in different ways , but the result was a close record of these kinds of conversations			1
the tapes have provided an eye - opening treasure trove for historians ( i recently used the @entity60 tapes as the heart of a forthcoming book on the @entity102 )			2
for @entity59 we have been able to hear incredible conversations at the height of the @entity106 in 1962 , when president @entity59 and his advisers wrestled with what to do about the @entity110 buildup in @entity111			1
we hear @entity59 pushing back against hawkish officials who were determined to use force as a solution to the problem			0
after the president outlined the challenges the @entity17 faced , air force chief of staff @entity116 said " you 're in a pretty bad fix , mr. president			2
" the tapes record the president responding , " you 're in there with me			1
" we can also hear that the decision - making process was much more tumultuous and dynamic than earlier analysts led us to believe			0
the @entity60 tapes cover everything from civil rights to @entity131 to sex scandals			2
among them are conversations between @entity60 and @entity135 of @entity136 , the most powerful @entity137 in the @entity138 , about the dangers of involvement in @entity131 and questioning whether the war was necessary — in 1964 and 1965			2
during one conversation , @entity135 , who was a @entity144 hawk , admits the war " scares the life out of me			0
... we just got into the thing and there 's no way out and we 're just getting pushed forward and forward and forward			0
" we can hear @entity60 firsthand as he becomes increasingly frustrated with the urban riots in 1967 and understands how they will undermine his political coalition			0
@entity52 's tapes can be shocking , far beyond the expletives			1
through these tapes we can hear a truly machiavellian politician constantly plotting ways to undercut his @entity160 opponents and often thinking of policy in the crassest political terms			0
one tape provided the shocking revelation that @entity52 extended the war in @entity131 until after the 1972 election for political gain			1
frustrated with the negotiations over a peace in @entity131 , @entity52 tells secretary of state @entity170 on april 6 , 1971 , that he is willing to unleash brutal military force if necessary			1
" well , things better start to happen or — you know , i 'm — you probably do n't believe me , but i can perfectly turn , i 'm capable of turning right awful hard			0
i never have in my life			0
but if i found that there 's no other way — in other words , hell , if you think @entity182 had flower children fighting , we 'll bomb the goddamn @entity184 like it 's never been bombed ... we 'll bomb those bastards , and then let the @entity17 people — let this country go up in flames			0
" unfortunately , @entity58 taping became politically toxic after @entity55			1
once special assistant @entity191 revealed the taping system to the @entity193 on july 16 , 1973 , from what we know , everything went dark			0
no longer would presidents record their conversations			2
no longer would they allow tape recorders into the hidden rooms of the @entity58			2
as scandal politics made every conversation even more dangerous , with congressional investigators , independent prosecutors and reporters looking at everything possible as ammunition in the scorched earth game of politics , from what we know , less and less of anything was recorded			0
even emails became toxic after @entity214 officials desperately erased electronic correspondence in november 1986 as part of the @entity217 cover up			0
there have been frequent reports that presidents since @entity222 have been discouraging people in the @entity58 from recording anything for fear that it would be subpoenaed			1
the @entity7 tapes offer a glimmer of hope that the situation was not so bleak			1
in the spring there were also reports about the possibility of tapes from the @entity222 era			0
perhaps somewhere in the @entity236 and presidential libraries there are more recordings than we know of			0
given that the presidents we know about had different kinds of recordings — from the @entity244 telephone conversations of @entity60 to the more limited @entity6 tapes of @entity7 — it is possible that there is more data than we know about , even with @entity249 and president @entity250			1
nor do we know what kind of tapes exist as a result of our new era of intense surveillance			0
perhaps the @entity257 , for instance , has been amassing more of a presidential archive than we know			0
let 's hope that the @entity7 release creates some pressure on presidents to think again about the costs of going dark			1
while the appeal of not recording anything is obvious in this age of bitter polarized warfare , the long - term costs are immense as they greatly diminish the ability of historians to understand what took place in @entity273 and to provide @entity17 with the most accurate understanding of our political past			0
indeed , this kind of documentation becomes all that more important as so much of our media coverage of politics is tainted by a partisan lens			0
in the end , the most important part of the " legacy " of a president has less to do with their approval ratings or the ongoing polls that people conduct , ranking them like top 10 music , but rather with the continual conversation that writers will have as they keep digging into the archival record and putting together a more accurate history of the period			2
without recordings in a political world that often revolves around private conversation , we are always limited in what we can understand			0
hopefully the release of the @entity7 tapes might provide some impetus to make sure the @entity58 encourages its staff to make the best record possible of their time in @entity273 .			1
