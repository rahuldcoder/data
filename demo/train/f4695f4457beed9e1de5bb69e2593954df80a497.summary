@entity0 -- the @entity2 denounced president @entity4 's compromise over whether to require religiously affiliated institutions to provide contraception to female employees , saying the proposal raises " serious moral concerns , " according to a statement posted on its website late friday			1
" today 's proposal continues to involve needless government intrusion in the internal governance of religious institutions , and to threaten government coercion of religious people and groups to violate their most deeply held convictions , " the statement said			1
under the new plan announced by @entity4 , religiously affiliated universities and hospitals will not be forced to offer contraception coverage to their employees			1
insurers will be required , however , to offer complete coverage free of charge to any women who work at such institutions			1
women who work at churches , though , will have no guarantee of such contraception coverage -- a continuation of current law			1
news of the compromise came after days of escalating partisan and ideological rhetoric over the divisive issue			0
the @entity40 originally wanted to require hospitals and schools with religious ties to offer full contraception coverage			1
many @entity46 leaders and other religious groups strongly oppose any requirement for contraception coverage on theological grounds			1
the question of whether institutions with religious ties should be required to offer insurance plans covering birth control and the so - called morning after pill , among other things , hits a number of political hot buttons			1
liberal groups have pushed for an expansive contraception coverage requirement on grounds of gender equality in health care			1
conservatives generally consider it a violation of the @entity67 and an infringement on religious liberty			0
the statement released by the @entity72 conference said the proposal requires " careful moral analysis , " saying it did not appear to offer clear protection for self - insured religious employers or religious and secular for - profit and non-profit employers			1
it came hours after the president briefed @entity82 archbishop @entity81 , head of the @entity72 conference			1
@entity81 later released a statement declaring " while there may be openness to respond to some of our concerns , we reserve judgment on the details until we have them			0
" but ' today 's decision ... is a first step in the right direction , " he said			2
under the proposal , there will be a one - year transition period for religious organizations after the policy formally takes effect on august 1			2
" no woman 's health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes			2
" @entity4 said at the @entity40			0
but " the principle of religious liberty " is also at stake			0
" as a citizen and as a @entity112 , i cherish this right			0
" the president also discussed the decision with sister @entity116 of the @entity117 and @entity118 , head of @entity119			2
some political analysts believe the controversy could cost @entity4 votes in politically critical states like @entity124 and @entity125 in november , while others insist it will ultimately hurt @entity127 with suburban women			2
reaction to friday 's decision fell largely along predictable party lines			2
@entity133 leaders embraced the revised rule , while @entity127 called it inadequate			2
" the rule announced by president @entity4 today guarantees that all women will have access to free contraception coverage through their employers , while protecting the religious freedom of faith - based institutions , " said senate majority leader @entity135 , @entity136			1
" i strongly support the rule announced today because in the year 2012 , women should not be denied access to contraception			1
... whether women choose to use contraception should be their decision , not the decision of their employers or politicians in @entity0			1
" @entity119 's @entity118 also praised the decision , arguing that " in the face of a misleading and outrageous assault on women 's health , " it " does not compromise a woman 's ability to access these critical birth control benefits			1
" but conservative rep. @entity161 , @entity162 , insisted the revised rule still violates the @entity163			2
" this @entity166 rule still tramples on @entity167 ' @entity67 right to freedom of religion , " @entity161 said in a written statement			2
" it 's a fig leaf , not a compromise			2
whether they are affiliated with a church or not , employers will still be forced to pay an insurance company for coverage that includes abortion - inducing drugs			1
" rep. @entity177 , @entity178 , said the revised rule " simply pretends to shift costs away from religious employers , but it does n't fix the problem and is another call for individuals and institutions to compromise on principle			1
" @entity177 , chairman of the @entity187 , said friday 's decision guarantees congressional action on the matter			2
" the @entity163 does not compromise ; those rights are inalienable and can not be bartered away for political expediency and convenience , " he said			0
" the administration has simply reaffirmed that congressional action to permanently reverse this mandate is necessary			0
" published polls show a slight majority of @entity167 @entity199 actually favored the administration 's original proposed rule			1
" i think ( @entity4 's ) punting , just kicking the can down the road , " @entity203 archbishop @entity202 told @entity1			0
" he 's has n't really addressed our concerns			0
i think the only thing to do is ... to take back the whole thing			0
" @entity211 from the @entity117 said she was " very pleased " with the @entity40			0
sources familiar with @entity40 thinking on the matter have said the administration is convinced approval from conservative @entity199 is out of reach , and is trying to win over more progressive @entity199			0
@entity217 reported wednesday that the administration was deeply divided over how to handle the issue			0
vice president @entity219 -- who is catholic -- and former white house chief of staff @entity220 warned @entity4 about the possibility of negative political repercussions in swing states if the @entity40 moved ahead with the initial rule			1
several female members of the administration -- including @entity228 secretary @entity227 -- urged the president to move forward with the initial rule , @entity217 said			1
@entity40 press secretary @entity230 denied the report , though he declined to offer any details			0
" a lot of these accounts are overdramatized , " a senior administration official insisted friday			0
on the presidential campaign trail , @entity127 frontrunner @entity236 pledged earlier to eliminate the original version of the rule on his first day in office			1
both the @entity40 and @entity236 's @entity127 opponents , however , noted a @entity243 law in effect while @entity236 was governor that required hospitals -- including @entity46 ones -- to provide emergency contraception to rape victims			1
it 's ironic for @entity236 to criticize " the president for pursuing a policy that is virtually identical to the one that was in place when he was governor of @entity243 , " @entity230 said wednesday			1
@entity236 , in turn , said @entity230 needs to " check his history			0
" in 2005 then - gov. @entity236 vetoed a bill that would have required all hospitals -- including @entity46 hospitals -- to provide emergency contraception			2
the heavily @entity133 state legislature overrode his veto			0
according to news reports at the time , @entity236 initially said his administration would not enforce the law at @entity46 hospitals			0
but he later reversed course , saying all hospitals would have to supply the morning - after pill			0
@entity236 was quoted at the time as saying , " my personal view in my heart of hearts is that people who are subject to rape should have the option of having emergency contraception or emergency contraception information			0
" " i worked very hard to get the legislature to remove all of the mandated coverages , including contraception , " @entity236 told reporters wednesday			0
this " was a provision that got there before i did , and it was one that i fought to remove			0
" @entity1 's @entity288 , @entity289 , @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , and @entity297 contributed to this report			0
