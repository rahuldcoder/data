-- sure , the @entity4 on your phone or dedicated device can get you from @entity5 to point b on the interstate , frustrating " calibrating ... calibrating ... " moments aside			1
but a new move in mobile tech is seeing startups who want to help you find the store you 're looking for in the mall , turn around when you 're getting farther from your terminal at the airport or figure out where your friends are in an expansive convention hall			1
and the big guys of the tech world are taking notice			0
@entity23 has bought a company called @entity25 , a 2 - year - old @entity27 - based startup focused on indoor gps , the company has confirmed to the @entity28 and other outlets			1
the reported price was $ 20 million			0
that move makes sense for @entity23 , which in the last year has attempted , with varying degrees of success , to go head - to - head with rival @entity35 in the mapping space			1
the last several versions of @entity38 have included indoor navigation , at least for locations that have been mapped by the computing giant on its expansive database			1
@entity35 says it has mapped more than 10,000 buildings in 13 countries			0
with the big two going at it , other companies have teamed up			0
@entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and others formed the @entity52 last fall to advance indoor mapping			1
@entity25 , which up until now had been shopping out its system to independent app developers , is one of several startups that are marrying traditional gps coordinates with smartphone tools like accelerometers and compasses to get more precise coordinates			1
those are the same tools used by fitness - oriented digital pedometers to track the number of steps a user has taken , their speed , the distance they 've climbed and other location - based data			1
the company claims to be able to pinpoint the user 's location indoors within about 8 feet			0
most gps features , designed for outdoor travel , can pinpoint the user within about 30 feet			2
" this accuracy will change how you interact with indoor environments , " co-founder @entity81 , one of the former @entity83 students who started @entity25 , told the @entity84 in 2011			2
" think about going to the supermarket			0
we can provide information relevant to the product right in front of you			0
" depending upon the app that 's built on it , the opposite can , of course , be true , too			0
theoretically , indoor gps could be used to let the grocery store know where you are and digitally shout at you that those bananas in front of you are two bunches for $ 1 today only			1
like @entity38 , @entity25 and other new indoor navigators require some advance work			2
someone must have mapped out a building with the tool for it to accurately give a good sense of things in a building			2
so , presumably , any mapping tool @entity23 offers likely will be available for major locations in major cities first , before spreading elsewhere			1
" i could walk into your building and have @entity119 location working within an hour , " @entity81 told the @entity84 review			0
presumably , a mall , hospital , grocery store or convention center could create its own app using indoor gps			1
( but not @entity25 's now			0
by monday afternoon , virtually its entire official presence online had been scrubbed , including , not surprisingly , its spot in the @entity128 )			0
of course , with any tool designed to track the user 's every move , privacy becomes in issue			2
@entity35 , @entity23 and other tech and @entity136 heavyweights like @entity137 are n't in the business of giving away services ; they need to find a way to make money from them			1
consumers who want to use such products ca n't expect to get them for free and have complete privacy , @entity143 , head of consumer electronics research for @entity146 , told tech blog @entity152			2
" users have to make their own judgment when using them , while companies have to thread a tightrope to ensure they do not enrage the users , " he said .			0

@entity23 *buy* *highlights* growing " indoor gps " *capabilities*
tools give users directions inside malls , hospitals , convention halls
@entity171 *combines* @entity4 with accelerometers , compasses in phones
privacy is a concern for some potential users
