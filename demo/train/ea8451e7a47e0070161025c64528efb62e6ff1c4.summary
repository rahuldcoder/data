-- three men who toppled an ancient boulder in @entity4 's @entity3 have been booted from their @entity6 leadership roles			1
video of @entity8 shoving the huge rock off a slender pedestal where its rested for millions of years went viral online and prompted media scrutiny			1
@entity8 sang the rock song " @entity15 " as he pushed the delicate sculpture over , which was followed by laughter and high fives with his son			1
@entity20 , who shot the video and posted it on @entity22 , and the two @entity23 were leading a boy scout group on a visit to the park when the incident happened			1
the @entity28 and the organization 's @entity29 issued almost simultaneous and similar statements monday addressing the men 's actions			1
" after reviewing this matter with the local chartered organization , these men have been removed from their leadership positions and are no longer members of the @entity40 , " the national statement said			1
the local council statement said the former leaders violated the @entity28 ' principle of " leave no trace , " which it said " teaches the value of natural areas and the methods we can use to help protect and conserve these areas for future generations			1
" the three men , all from @entity4 , defended their actions in interviews last week , saying the delicate structure posed a threat to visitors			1
but park officials suggested they broke the law by defacing a state park			1
the attention has led to revelations that @entity8 filed a personal - injury lawsuit in september , claiming he had suffered " serious , permanent and debilitating injuries " from a 4 - year - old car crash			1
" someone with a bad back who 's disabled , who ca n't enjoy life , to me , does n't step up and push a rock that big off the base , " the defendant in @entity8 's lawsuit , @entity64 , told @entity67 television station @entity66			1
@entity8 's lawyer did not return calls for comment			2
but when @entity0 affiliate @entity79 noted that @entity8 did n't look particularly debilitated in the video , he replied , " you did n't see how hard i pushed			2
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity82 said when someone has a pending disability lawsuit , " you 'd think they 'd avoid the camera like the plague			2
" but instead , they think no one will ever see it or repercussions will ever come of it , " @entity82 said			2
@entity3 , in southern @entity4 , is home to thousands of the mushroom - shaped rocks -- known to locals as goblins -- that developed as millions of years of winds and water eroded sandstone cliffs			1
" we have now modified @entity3 , a new @entity3 exists , " @entity20 is heard saying at the end of his video			2
" that 's crazy that it was held up just by that little bit of dirt			2
some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and @entity8 saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way			0
so it 's all about saving lives here at @entity3			0
that 's what we 're all about			0
" @entity20 told @entity4 television station @entity79 that the boulder seemed unstable			1
" that was n't going to last very long at all , " he told the @entity0 affiliate			0
" one gust of wind and a family 's dead			0
" asked if he would do it again , he said , " absolutely , absolutely			0
" but @entity126 , the deputy director of @entity127 , said , " it did n't look like a stiff wind to me			0
" " obviously , we 're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed , " he told @entity79			0
in his 22 years on the job , he said he had not heard of any goblins rolling off their pedestals			0
" i wish we would have been smart enough to go get a ranger ' cause it was wrong of us to be vigilantes , and i 'm sorry i did that , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity137			0
" we thought we were doing a good deed , " @entity8 told the affiliate			0
but the @entity145 attorney or the @entity4 attorney general may not agree , said @entity147 of @entity127			1
the men " are currently under criminal investigation , " he said ont friday			2
" it gives you a pit in your stomach			0
there seems to be a lot of happiness and joy with the individuals doing this , and it 's not right			0
this is not what you do at a natural scenic area			0
" @entity0 correspondent @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
