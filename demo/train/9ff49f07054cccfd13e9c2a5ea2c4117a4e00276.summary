you may not have heard of @entity1			0
but if there are teenagers or 20 - somethings in your life , it 's a safe bet that they have			2
@entity7 is a mobile app which lets users share images or videos that disappear after a few seconds			1
that 's right -- they vanish forever in the time it takes you to read a tweet			0
in a little over a year since it was released by a @entity19 student and his recently graduated business partner , @entity1 has has quietly amassed millions of users and now claims to process more than 30 million messages a day			2
some bloggers have called it the " next @entity25			0
" not bad for a mobile tool which , rightly or wrongly , is often cited for one very specific ability -- the " sexting " of naughty images to other users			1
in an age when young people are constantly being warned not to post inappropriate things online , @entity7 offers a degree of freedom by letting users share unfiltered thoughts or images without much fear of reprisal			1
" like most people born before the 1990s , i 'm not a @entity1 user , and i 've long assumed the worst about the app -- that combining cameras ; young people ; and secret , self - destructing messages could only mean trouble , " wrote @entity42 's @entity41 last week			1
but increasingly , he writes , it appears possible that " teenagers are more likely using the app to safely explore the sort of silly , unguarded , and sometimes unwise ideas that have always occupied the teenage brain ... in a manner that wo n't haunt them forever			0
in other words , they 're chatting with @entity7 precisely because it 's not like chatting with @entity60			1
" not to be outdone , @entity60 last month actually launched a virtually identical social app called @entity60 , a mobile re-imagining of one of the site 's earliest , and ultimately most ridiculed , features			1
but instead of siphoning users from @entity1 , @entity60 's move appears instead to have launched the upstart app to new heights			1
both apps let users send images or short videos and messages via their smartphones			1
the sender can choose how long the message will be visible -- up to 10 seconds -- before it self - destructs			1
@entity60 ceo @entity78 reportedly was part of the team that coded the @entity60 app , currently available only on @entity84 's @entity83 system , in only a couple of weeks			1
a family photo posted by sister @entity87 purportedly showed their family playing with the app over the holidays			0
but if @entity60 was looking to flex its billion - user muscle to take over the instant - chat market , it does n't appear to be working			1
on thursday , @entity1 was the sixth-most popular free app for @entity84 's mobile devices			1
@entity60 was n't in the top 100			1
as @entity97 said in a recent headline , " the kids like @entity1 because it 's not @entity60			2
" a newer version of @entity1 for @entity104 's @entity103 devices sat at a respectable no. 33 in the @entity106 store , ahead of stalwarts like @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			0
@entity60 is n't available for @entity103			2
a look by analytics firm @entity113 showed that mentions of @entity1 on @entity116 spiraled to more than 212,000 on @entity117 , up from about 16,000 on december 20 , the day before @entity60 introduced @entity118			2
@entity60 got 1,822 mentions on january 1 , according to @entity113			2
so , does that mean young , socially savvy users are sending millions of racy pictures of themselves through cyberspace every day ? it 's difficult to say			1
technological advances and nudie shots have shared a strong , if secretive , relationship for centuries			0
from the printing press to pay - per - view to @entity129 , new tech ( particularly the kind that creates new levels of privacy ) has always been followed closely by folks figuring out how to personally or professionally use it to get dirty			0
there are clear , and sometimes ugly , signs that sexting is common on @entity1			0
" @entity144 , " a @entity146 blog full of nude and semi-nude images , was started up last month by a " party photographer " who says he put out an open call for salacious shots on @entity116 and was overwhelmed by the response			2
another @entity1 - themed blog on @entity146 is filled with complaints about male users sharing photos of their genitalia			1
snapchat users may think their naughty images will never come back to haunt them			1
but people can still grab screenshots from their phones , even though both @entity1 and @entity60 notify the sender if the recipient of an image takes a shot of it			2
and last week , @entity163 exposed an apparent security flaw that it says lets recipients retrieve videos sent via @entity7			1
all of which should be bad news when young people and questionable decisions collide with the dark alleys of the @entity173 , where even the most ill - gotten of sleaze is posted			2
@entity1 did not respond to an interview request from @entity176			0
but in one of only a handful of interviews he 's given since launching , @entity7 co-founder @entity177 told @entity181 he thinks the sex talk about his app is overblown			1
" i 'm not convinced that the whole sexting thing is as big as the media makes it out to be , " he told @entity181			0
" i just do n't know people who do that			0
it does n't seem that fun when you can have real sex			0
" but he also acknowledged to @entity181 that the idea for the app , which he and @entity197 hashed out after meeting at @entity19 's @entity199 fraternity house , was partly inspired by @entity202 rep. @entity201 's unfortunate decision to share racy photos via @entity116			0
so , if not for naughty bits , what exactly is the purpose of sending images and videos that rapidly disappear ? in a september blog post celebrating its first anniversary , @entity7 shared a vision that comes off as downright wholesome			1
" we believe in sharing authentic moments with friends , " it read			0
" it 's not all about fancy vacations , sushi dinners , or beautiful sunsets			0
sometimes it 's an inside joke , a silly face , or greetings from a pet fish			0
" there is value in the ephemeral , " the post continues			0
" great conversations are magical			0
that 's because they are shared , enjoyed , but not saved			0
