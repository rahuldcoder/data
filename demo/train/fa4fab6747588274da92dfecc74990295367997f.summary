@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 said thursday he approved the use of @entity6 military aircraft to help return to @entity8 those @entity8 citizens who have fled to @entity1 to escape unrest in neighboring @entity11 as the @entity12 called for stepped - up aid to refugees			1
nearly 180,000 people , mainly foreign workers , have fled to the neighboring nations of @entity1 and @entity8 amid fighting between government troops and rebels pushing to oust longtime strongman @entity20 , the @entity12 refugee agency reported			1
about 95,000 people have crossed into @entity1 and another 83,000 into @entity8 , the office of the @entity12 high commissioner for refugees estimated			1
but it was the would - be migrants stuck in @entity11 that was most concerning to @entity27 , who on the @entity1 side of the border with @entity11			1
" we 're worried about people on the other side of the border , " said the spokeswoman for the @entity12 's @entity31			1
" we 're calling for humanitarian safe passage to deliver food inside to people in @entity39 and elsewhere			2
" she said she had heard stories from recent arrivals of food shortages " in many places of @entity11			2
" she praised the efforts of @entity1 along the border , but said their generosity had limits			1
" they 've provided all they could , " she said , adding that they " ca n't continue			0
" in @entity53 , @entity3 told reporters that he also authorized the @entity55 to charter additional planes " to help people from other countries find their way home			0
" " tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing @entity11 , and we commend the governments of @entity1 and @entity8 for their response , even as they go through their own political transitions , " @entity3 said			1
@entity67 , the top airport official in the @entity1 city of @entity0 , told @entity2 that @entity69 plans to fly chartered jets between that coastal city and @entity72 six times a day for five days			1
@entity74 has reigned on the @entity1 border for days as thousands have clamored to get out of @entity11 , and many have found themselves trapped in a no - man 's land between the two countries			1
thousands more were housed in tents provided by @entity81 and the @entity1 military , and many have little money and no travel documents with them			1
in @entity0 , about 90 km ( 55 miles ) from the border , hundreds of refugees waited thursday for flights out			0
some napped on the floor ; others sat up against the walls waiting			0
but the process appeared orderly , given the number of would - be passengers , as airport officials moved them along in orderly lines with no pushing or shoving			0
the majority carried only small bags containing the bare necessities that they managed to escape with			0
one elderly man 's luggage consisted of a tightly wrapped blanket -- the only possession that survived his journey out of @entity11			2
earlier thursday , @entity81 sounded an urgent appeal to governments to help in the mass evacuation required to get people out			0
and after a call among secretary - general @entity111 and representatives of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity12 organizations , the world body called for help to avert a humanitarian disaster			2
" there is a strong need for urgent relief -- food , water , sanitation and shelter to the thousands on both sides of the @entity1 and @entity8 borders due to significant population movements , mainly of migrant workers , " a @entity12 statement warned			1
" it is also necessary to prepare for a further possible escalation of humanitarian needs should conditions deteriorate inside @entity11			2
" the participants in thursday 's talks , which included the @entity137 , the @entity138 and the @entity139 , urged @entity11 to allow " immediate and unimpeded access " to determine what was needed			0
" the situation here remains tense , " said @entity142 , a spokesman for the @entity12 refugee agency on the @entity1 border			1
" there is lots of congestion on this side of the border and we are hearing that many thousands are waiting on the @entity11 side to come through			2
village bakeries have increased production to feed the stranded , he said			0
" the local community has been so generous in providing food , medicines and places to stay , but the capacity of the local community is reaching its limit because the numbers are so huge , " he said			0
the refugees include @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 who had entered @entity11 seeking work			0
but most of the workers are @entity8 citizens , and that country 's caretaker government has paid for flights from @entity0 to @entity72 to take them home			0
@entity2 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 and journalist @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
