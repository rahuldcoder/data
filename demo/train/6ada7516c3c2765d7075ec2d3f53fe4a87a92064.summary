-- it 's not news that the @entity3 enjoys killing celebrities			1
but the hoaxes seem a bit meaner and more callous when the details appear to be lifted from an actual accident involving a fatality			2
" @entity11 " star @entity10 took to @entity12 over the weekend to dispel a fake report he had been killed in a car crash on @entity15 in @entity16			1
according to the story that made the rounds on the @entity20 -- including a fake @entity22 website -- the accident involved his @entity23 , which crashed into a tractor - trailer near the @entity16 - @entity26 state line			1
" some of you will be glad to hear this , others strangely disappointed , but			0
i am alive and well ! , " he tweeted			2
he later added , " does someone have to die to trend ? geez ! thanks for all the love everybody			2
i did n't know you cared			2
glad to be breathing ! " however , someone did die recently in a crash at that site			0
the @entity37 ( @entity26 ) news reported that @entity38 , 26 , was killed thursday when the @entity39 she was traveling in crossed the center line on @entity15 and was struck by a tractor - trailer			0
@entity38 's @entity42 , @entity43 , and her 2 - year - old son , @entity44 , were also in the car and critically injured			0
stars are often the targets of such hoaxes			0
actor @entity49 has been " killed " several times on @entity12 , and actor @entity51 appeared on " @entity52 " in 2009 to announce that he was , in fact , still alive despite @entity3 reports to the contrary			1
@entity56 , which posted the fake @entity10 death report , also posted an erroneous report that former " @entity60 " child star @entity59 had died of a drug overdose			1
the headline for the story listed the actor as " @entity65			0
" @entity59 appeared to take the news in in stride , tweeting from his unverified account , " well apparently i 'm dead , lol but i 'll have you know i 'm doing well and enjoying a cup of coffee at home			0
" according to @entity74 , several sites picked up on the @entity10 death hoax , which also appeared on a fake @entity77 site			1
the @entity74 attempted to trace the fake sites and reported that the registration names for @entity56 are listed as private , while the fake @entity81 site is registered to someone named @entity83 in @entity84			0
unlike his " @entity11 " character @entity85 , @entity10 showed he had a heart , offering his condolences to @entity38 's loved ones and apologies to those taken aback by the premature reports of his passing			1
" regrets to my friends and family who were shocked this morning and the family of the woman who actually died in my ' supposed ' accident , " he tweeted .			1

@entity10 of " @entity11 " fame tweeted he did n't die after fake reports
" @entity60 " star also was a *victim* of death hoax
a woman was killed in the accident alleged to be @entity10 's
